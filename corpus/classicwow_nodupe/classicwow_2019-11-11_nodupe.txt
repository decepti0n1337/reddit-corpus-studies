I don't know, 30 I guess. I started at 40 so I could use Holy Shield right away.

It's funny that you tried to repair the arm but then you italicized the face.

Dire maul prolly
---
If youre gear isnt there yet just add more players until it runs smooth for you.
---
Dire maul lol
---
Well, Wowhead can't be blindly trusted on this as many of them are probably killed by people not on the quest, and the skull would not drop for them.
---
It happens in a lot of areas. Blasted lands is especially bad. 5-6 types of enemies share spawn points.

It's the new Bloodbreaker class that's gonna come with Classic+

"You can use in combat, but it will not de-agro mobs. It can however be used to sneak past mobs."

Comment from 2006.

I leveled my priest pretty much in holy all the way. Spirit tap carries you hard. I'm using spirit tap build right now. I can efficiently heal dungeons and raids and be able to solo grind if I want. That's so easy and nice. If I want, I can dish out some damage, and with Pala in group over 1k smite crits is not something to sneeze about.
---
Believe me or not, i only added a \\.......
---
I'm just saying, the drop rate is not 100%, or even 70%. I killed a lot of peasants and farmers, way more than than 20, and not all of them dropped skulls
---
Those are some rookie numbers
---
For sure. If you can't see how me casting corruption without a cast time suggests I have actually used talents, I'm not that bummed about missing out on the run, haha.

Aw no way im gonna level as prot, the specc i use is already annoying enough on a pvp server
---
I considered using a shield and wep in dungeons but people wanted a pure prot to hold aggro in dungeons for their weird AoE cleave thing. I dont know how right they are, so i just made up my mind to level solo till 60.
---
Oh well, it happens. Sometimes the multiplayer aspect is amazing and sometimes you just have to think "how did you even manage to install the game?" Take the bad with the good I suppose.
---
7 bucks a month is something to brag about?
---
Those kill quests in WPL are brutal.
---
Classic timesink.
---
Healing in general sounds boring as fuck
---
Lol that's awesome
---
I remember doing a quest that seemed to require killing four of a creature for which there appeared to be three spawn points...
---
That was always my lore reason lol. Boars not dropping livers because theirs got damaged in battle or were diseased lol.
---
Ive just hit 31 and not struggling to find people in any zone or dungeon. Lots of people still leveling or are leveling alts.
---
I always just tell myself that the quest giver needs perfect samples of blood, claws, hooves, etc. and if they're damaged in any way you don't get credit so there's no point in picking them up.
---
As Draenei we have it worse because it‚Äôs always like one pixel stopping your character from going thru a lot of shit mounted. I quit the game because of it, oh and because of Honk Kong.
---
Come back when you can make an argument that doesnt rely on personal insults.
---
Get Mark of the chosen from Mara quest

is it still layered?

Topping the charts is only relative to who is in the raid and has nothing to do with the difficulty of the raid

How dare you assume their gender.

As a Druid, no.

Come back when you actually have an argument not a big cry
---
Damn, what a great way to put it. Sounds like a bittersweet moment for you. Good luck in your future endeavors
---
I'm not planning on quitting but the community is what will probably get me.  All of this loot reservation, meta , min max bs stuff drives me crazy and really is in contrast to vanilla.
---
I've played exclusively on pvp servers since release and I'm currently on my third reroll on a pve server.  The community is MUCH better if even a little less knowledgeable but I like that.  Pvp in vanilla had some griefing but it ruined your reputation.  Now it seems to be encouraged and I was never once attacked by the same level or not by a group.  I even won several gank attempts by players 5 levels above me.
---
The game is back but the spirit of vanilla is loooong dead I'm afraid
---
tauren can't ride even black raptors until like TBC pre-patch.
---
It was just some theory crafting - but IMO improved aspect of the hawk isn't super useful in pvp - more of the time as you kite you wont be able to benefit from the extra 30% attack speed - and it will proc randomly.
---
I do agree, that your pet wont be outputting insane damage without Beastial wrath, so beefing up the pet doesn't make a whole lot of sense - I guess the main idea of this spec is to give you as many tools as possible with lots of cc and ways to get out of sticky situations.
---
Putting minor speed on white boots &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

catch me now barrens raptor
---
The long-ass chain that starts with the ghost on the edge of Blasted Lands at one point has you kill *three* of an enemy that has only *two spawns.*
---
And they have an exceptionally long respawn timer.
---
Beyond spreading those threat abilities around there‚Äôs a few things you can do to keep mobs under control.
---
Don‚Äôt ever use taunt at the start of a pull. Taunt gives you equal threat to the highest at the time and makes the mob target you. You should let someone pull threat, then taunt. Now you have their (high) threat AND the mobs attention.
---
If a mob is gonna die ‚Äúsoon‚Äù sometimes I‚Äôll just taunt/mocking blow and then target something else to build threat on. It will stick to you for a few seconds, you might lose it for a few, and then it‚Äôs dead.
---
Use stun (conc blow) and disarm to buy time. Maybe you can‚Äôt taunt a mob or you already taunted a different one. A dps can tank a mob if it‚Äôs stunned or disarmed.
---
I think of a Prot warrior more as a brawler than a tank. You have mobility, you have utility, do what it takes to stop squishies getting popped. You don‚Äôt need ‚Äúaggro‚Äù, that‚Äôs just a means to an end. You need to mitigate damage on you and your party/raid.
---
Is a hunter's (with a pet) leveling experience more simple, smooth and hassle free than for a single target (frostbolt) mage? I like the easy rotation of frostbolt, frost nova and wand, and blink for escaping, but a bit dislike drinking and lack of ability to drop combat. Will hunter be better for me?
---
That‚Äôs what I said to him a few weeks ago but he feels left behind.
---
The real explanation is that psychologically infrequent reward - while taking longer to train and reinforce a behavior - is far more powerful and longer lasting than reward every time a behavior is performed.  
---
    
---
This is why professional animal trainers use a technique called ‚Äúfading the lure‚Äù, where reward and praise is given every time at first - then slowly it‚Äôs reduced to every second correct action, then every third, etc. 
---
World of Warcraft is essentially addicting players through *Operant Conditioning.*
---
  
---
This powerful psychological effect is what makes games of chance like slot machines or roulette work.
---
Rogue to warrior. Our first couple raids were something like 13 rogues and 4 warriors but I like my new guild and Im having more fun with fury
---
Fuck those guys
---
Are they summoning a boomkin?
---
"I can cast fire spells right?"
---
"Yes."
---
"Okay, I cast Fire Blast inside the wolf."
---
"Your spell crits and vaporizes the wolf's blood."
---
"Now I cut the wolf open to get their blood."
---
"But you just..."
---
"I SAID I CUT THE WOLF!"
---
&gt; someone has to draw the short straw when overall there is more horde than alliance.
---
I get that, but this is worse than ANY other servers. It's really what the fuck status.

It‚Äôs not that bad, 5:1 horde stacked is thrown around so frequently now it‚Äôs lost all meaning. 
---
There are plenty of you Alliance, I think the server got quite a few Arugal alliance re-rolls also. It‚Äôs 3:2 at worst so please get the notion of horrendous imbalance out of ya head mate because it ain‚Äôt a thing on Yojamba.
---
From a pure dps perspective witchblade + aquementas gives slightly more spell power than rod of the ogre magi. However the rod is more suitable for both in and outside raids due to the spell crit and stamina. I personally despise glass cannon builds so I went with the staff. If you can get lucky with loot then I:d suggest getting both and use witchblade when raiding.
---
People are going to be clearing MC the rest of classic. Most guilds try to do clear all the raids each reset
---
Witchblade + Spirit. Get as much SP as you can. 1% crit is equivalent to like 8 spellpower right now.
---
Answer is warrior.
---
Find a 'semi - hardcore' guild, often full of people with lives who also want to tryhard but are a bit better mentally adjusted.
---

Dem fucking raptor and demon horns...
---
Im leveling at my own pace in the wrong spec on a pvp server tho. Same thing i did in retail. Still enjoying it. Doesnt get more casual than that.
---
Very ambient my guy
---
Very good point, it‚Äôs true due to instant queue rather than wait to get a group together. Easier to pick and choose who to get in my group for gear purposes too.
---
Hunter can be pretty simple, they are tough to master though, but the basics of killing mobs just doing quests and the like is very simple and they have a high amount of suvivability
---
Anyone able to find their character on this site but not warcraftlogs? Lol
---
hillsbrad, stv, hopefully city raids and blackrock mountain will be crazy
---
You're not horde, are you?
---
Fuck enhancements, does bottom dps and still fucks the raid by triple crit wf at pull. 
---
Elemental is a worse boomkin, and I agree with the oomkin verdict In the thread.
---
Haha well to my defense, I can't have goofed if I didn't know how much it was worth in the first place!
---
I have TSM but it down show me disenchant values like this. Like what the item will disenchant into and how many etc
---
Someones been questing in wpl, I did the same thing. Atleast the spider silk was nice.
---
I wonder how does releasing DM early impacted badly ppl that did think its early. Cause imo it got no impact for casuals etc.
---
Here's a pro tip for you. Usually, the mobs are random respawns. When the quest asks for more grey than black, people kill greys and avoid blacks, which lowers the population of greys in comparison to blacks.
---
So if you find yourself with this type of quest, don't avoid the blacks, just kill every mob in the zone for fresh respawns, the grind is good exp anyway and you'll complete it faster compared to running around getting 0 exp trying to find browns.
---
I don't know if I'm explaining this right, so I'll just give an example of what I mean. Let's say you need 15 greys and 5 blacks. There are 20 greys and 20 blacks in the zone, on respawns, mobs can either be grey (50%) or black (50%).
---
Player A goes through the quest, he kills 5 blacks and 15 greys, there are now 15 blacks and 5 greys available, and 20 will respawn. The respawns will be 10 blacks and 10 greys at 50/50.
---
There are now 25 blacks and 15 greys. Player B goes through the quest, he kills 5 blacks and 15 greys. Which leaves the zone with 20 blacks and 0 greys. 20 respawns later, we now have 30 blacks and 10 greys.
---
Or gathering harpy talons, though not the talons they naturally drop... they need to drop their super special talon.
---
god I remember back in wotlk my char from the start of tbc had like 160 days.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah this is all true, except for the times when it‚Äôs not.
---
Just because you‚Äôve seen an occurrence more then once doesn‚Äôt mean it to be what happens 100% of the time when you are not in the area.
---
This is wrong.
---
Valuable boes are typically needed on. 
---
It's just something that the classic community does. 
---
Dont worry too much leveling gear gets replaced quickly.
---
I know lots of NA players who don't have a job and  do nothing but play 8-14 hours a day
---
 HAHAHHAA
---
Stupid sexy Flanders
---
600-1k on my server, depends on how badly people want it and how many are on the AH at any given time.
---
This is a thing that private servers never managed to do they had static spawns for every mobtype. in classic this is everywhere, its rare that a mob has a static spawn
---
No it's not...?
---
All of vanilla's raids are relevant throughout the entire content.
---
MC: Thunderfury, Sulfuras, BRE, Accuria, leaf/eye
---
BWL: Drakefang Talisman, Rejuv gem, Styleen's, Chromag/Nef weapons
---
AQ: T2.5 sets, C'thun loot
---
Ony: Viskag / Deathbringer, Ony head, Ony bag
---
ZG: Hakkar heart for world buff, cloak of consumption, head/leg enchants
---
I think AQ20 is the only raid that becomes "obsolete" because the only thing you really get from it is the spell rank books, after that there's not really much in there that people need, but it's always pugged because it's great for catching up / gearing alts
---
Yes, the honor brackets are proportionate to the number of active pvpers, where 'active' means &gt;15 Honorable Kills a week.
---
I fuckin love Steve‚Äôs mre reviews
---
It‚Äôs the equivalent exchange of being a badass
---
its about 65-70g on my server. if you want just run strat live runs and hope for the best. ive had runs where everyone got an orb each.
---
Herod east coast
---
Or those quests that want 15 of an item but the murloc camp only has 8 units total.  So you have to genocide them and wait for them to rebuild their society to genocide them again.  Rinse and repeat like four times.
---
just makes the leveling a breeze. i can also sell those white items on the AH when im done. or put them on an alt that.
---
[deleted]
---
This is nice and all, but it seems unlikely that most people would move off a server where they are favored now that queues are less of a thing.
---
Enchants from aq20.
---
Tries to. In OSRS both the player base and the employees tell you to lick their butt and suck on their balls.
---
It just means you need to get another 3% hit rating.
---
Fairbanks is good too
---
Their fun is playing ret, my fun is blitzing through raids, either way one of us won't have fun, it's not about fucking "world firsts" (fuck that strawman argument with an aids infected 15 incher) its about optimization and efficiency.
---
Auctionator too
---
Hunter would be probably more efficient for gold farming, but lock is a better BG choice.

Please post Art to r/wow \- Don't need multiple wow subs with art

why would you even try to trick new people into playing like braindead zombies with castsequence macros. Following this will most likely make you a WORSE player.

---
Do I need to quote you?
---
if you play on a high pop realm these quests are nightmare, even if you kill shared respawns someone else will kill the quest mobs before you, making you waste even more time... I wasted like 2 hours finishing the diseased wolf/bear quests..
---
I'm a 60 druid and this is litteraly what I do as well.
---
Classic hasnt even been out long enough for me to reach my retail time lol
---
Is anyone else having issues zoning into instances/loading? Frequently getting error messages stating instance not found or getting kicked to character selection after dying and getting a World server is down message when trying to log back in.
---
This guys spellcleaves
---
Unyelding Maul is basically the same. 
---
If you have trouble getting it from tribute runs, try buying it - on my server there are always some hunters selling it at around 20-30g.
---
Hoard = to collect and store a lot of something
---
Horde = a massive invading group
---
Because hybrids are already pvp gods with how strong their healing capability, buff their damage or mana options and they go out of control
---
It also gives you way more damage on glancing blows which are at least 40% of your white hits against a boss.
---
2 days. Yesterday I arrived at badlands for questing. Tested my luck and nothing. Camped for like 5 mins and moved on. Reached 43 and had to grind to 44. Took my chances and went again to camp but also to look for a group for Uldama. Eagle eye'd and bam found him.
---
I think fairlina is the most populated server

I did it while we were waiting to start ice crown citadel and yeah i got suspended too.

#NO CHANGES! üòÇ

That's what my alt bank character is for

Yep. My office chair is a Markus. Quickly upgraded my gaming chair to one, too.
---
It's a standard on one of the translate sites for some reason, it has a base list and that's on it.
---
A 49 man raid?
---
Then why aren't they called rock elewomentals?
---
The two guilds I know of that have it they all did it together, to me its more of a guild achievement than a personal one.
---
Not sure why you're downvoted so much. I can't wait for BWL either!
---
Is that an RP server? Why would knowing anything about their lore be an issue. Just pick whatever looks good for you, I'm not sure what other answer are you looking for. You're gonna pick a character based on recommendations of random people on the internet who don't know anything about your preferences?
---
but they actually do damage
---
MY MAN
---
Came for the memes stayed for the community. And we get a decent number of alliance to slap around
---
They probably already did it. These scoundrels only got more agressive with it
---
Super common, actually. Particularly of mobs of similar types. Like Ogres or Gnolls or Trolls.
---
Great stuff, good work!
---
Don't they have a bigger hitbox?
---
You win some, you lose some.
---
Maybe not perfect, but at least usable samples. He needed 15 pelts? Well, that pelt won‚Äôt be acceptable if it has a giant slice right across the middle. He needs some teeth or hooves? Well, he probably needs them to be inside a certain size range. 
---
But, it‚Äôs easier to just gloss over that instead of adding another system of rng into the game. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
When I was the first one in my guild to get my mount, half of them were in disbelief when I said keep the grey items to vendor.

---
That is incorrect though. You can't gain more than 1 rank a week after R4, and it says you can get R10 in 5 weeks.
---
unfortunately for you, history will not see it that way
---
They do this on purpose lol. The game wants you to grind mobs sometimes. What do you think all the STV Hemet Nessingway quest are?
---
You angrily  editing your comment will definitely help your case.
---
Fucking delusional!  These pieces of shit will camp people at instances and flight paths.
---
This is what you get for playing a meme race.
---
Enjoy.
---
I never understood why they had mount collision work this way.  Why not just have it so your collision size/position is just what it would be while unmounted, so that in cases like this, your character just clips through?
---
Hunter MM is god in bg
---
Don't forget enchanting a Skinning Knife!
---
Our guild looted last week in MC. Took all week to farm the gold to craft this. It comes out to about 400g on my servers economy. The 4 arcanite bars are the killer at 50-60g each.
---
Its actually lame how easy it is. I only raided tbc/wotlk before and MC is just so lame in comparison.
---
Literally look up Omnibar for Classic...
---
The Western PLaguelands be like "kill 8 wolves" 1000000000000000000 Spiders
---
Lol on Venoxis the horde was raiding IF as well yesterday night!
---
Yeah it was added with the Dire Maul patch
---
It varies based on level, you basically use whichever you trained last.
---
Dear lord how did I not know this!?  I haven't thought about glyphs in years, but this actually makes them useful... kind of.
---
It's just that literally everyone was warning people of this. That's why you won't get much sympathy.
---
I used to think that back in vanilla... until I made a 29 twink hunter and had a blast fight with and against other twinks. Its the closest thing to arenas in vanilla wow.
---
I disagree. The main reason people use 2H these days is because dps is impatient and don‚Äôt want to wait for sunders on each mob. People just want to complete the dungeon as quick as possible and tanks would love to be top dps like in later expansions. Tanking should only be about mitigation. Yes you get less rage gen with a shield, but you get enough to maintain threat on all mobs if dps follows the rules. Also, you get pretty much constant revenge procs with a shield so the threat efficiency (threat per rage consumed) is higher with a shield. 
---
Not saying it‚Äôs not viable, but I wouldn‚Äôt go solely 2H unless the healer specifically asks me to give it a go, or if I know they are especially good/overleveled/etc. I‚Äôm only level 45 but I‚Äôve tanked all of my dungeon runs with 1h and shield (except 2H sometimes for the SS+WW opener) and they all went smoothly. But could we have saved a few minutes here and there if I went 2h all the way? Sure.
---
i was starting fresh after launch with my friends, they made it up to lvl 40, eventually got bored went back to retail. I never played retail but had a time where i played vanilla wow and i enjoyed it so i kept playing and got lvl 60. I started doing dungeons for pre bis gear and farming maraudon but i got bored as well, and i was spending too much time on it since wow is addictive, i wanted to have more time to also play league and fifa. I also was alliance warlock and we had huge disadvantage on the server. Playing alone makes no fun at all.
---
Aah, so that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt find any wolves.
---
I‚Äôm Alliance on Stalagg and it‚Äôs dead for us. The last few weeks have been ultra shitty. Plus the horde are pricks there. I‚Äôm torn between Heartseeker and Arcanite Reaper. I really don‚Äôt like the idea of going to another server where alliance dominate even though they have a strong population/market. The benefits of AR is that it appears to be balanced but the server seems to pretty empty. I also like it‚Äôs a west coast server (dumb friend made us join this hell hole server). I‚Äôm kind of hoping a lot of ppl go to AR because it will be shitty being on an empty server. It‚Äôs pretty shitty I have to ditch my current server and make a gamble. &gt;_&lt;

Literally every rogue that knows anything about their class is pointing and laughing at you right now. Imagine stacking hit which only increases auto attack damage past hitcap, if you could stack crit while maintaining yellow hitcap which increases ALL your damage including Vis'kag proc.
---
I know it's a joke, but consider the fact that our toons constantly run at full speed without ever getting tired. If you put your character on walk mode oh my fucking god I'm in pain just thinking about it.
---
It'd take me another 10 years to surpass my retail /played time. Possibly even longer as I play way less now than I did in the past.
---
I was doing this last night! Those wind calling harpy bastards.
---
I haven‚Äôt played wow in year. I miss it.
---
I generally go 21 into marks for scatter so it‚Äôs pretty much 30/21/0 or 0/21/30 for me.  If I‚Äôm willing to skip on scatter it is 100% to get BW with 31/20/0.
---
Wait until your doing AB abd can't go inside the farm
---
Cant be grouped up with other people.
---
Made a small fix, please see the updated macro!
---
Do you have the flight paths for both SW and IF as well? If not it won't connect, unless you mean it's legit not on the map.
---
And all private servers offload some of the work to the players client which introduces vulnerabilities, something blizzard can't do.
---
Hi, when are they updated because I'm still currently missing 2 items I have and I've done raids since then.  Last updated 18th of October, Socks - Mograine
---
Stop using the word toxic you absolute tool.
---
Spoke too soon
---
This is also true for stuff such as fishing spots. When I'm at night fishing alone I'm always fishing all the firefin snappers in Tanaris because it spawns new other stuff.
---
I love how post partem mamas are thinking about wow classic.
---
PServers were using incorrect data. Classic Lashers are correct.
---
Ok boomer
---
Lol paladins are a joke
---
I floop the pig.
---
Lol pally had to use his oh shit buttons with HoR and mage still was close to win
---
You use those items while leveling?
---
I have a 49 warlock and 39 mage, wait for WSG and AB then the real fun can finally begin.
---
Rod ,1% crit is worth 15 spell damage at least+you get stats
---
Most of these quests would easily make more sense if they just added an adjective to the quest item. "Pristine Bear Heart" "Engorged Liver" ect.
---
Small world i guess and I love when that happens
---
Im not grouping up with my alt.
---
Staff so you can save a bag slot for more water
---
How'd I know it'd be that.
---
I like to imagine it as DPSing my friends.
---
Does wearing jeans make denim part of your identity? Your argument is terrible. You're just someone who is probably keeps how much they game a secret lest people think less of you, just as you think less of OP. You're projecting your own insecurities onto others.
---
But I don't trust that you'll be able to self reflect enough to actually understand this.
---
Thanks for this, I guess SM is in my future.
---
&gt;angrily
---
Nice projection.
---
So, answer my question.   Where's this wpvp counter raid at?  I've seen people swear up and down that this is what happens...
---
Everyone should need valuable boe items, but if someone can use an item that isn‚Äôt valuable give it to them
---
Yes.
---
Alliance literally camped the horde out of onyxia tonight to the point where people were considering not even raiding lmao - the server is just fine.
---
If you're serious about PvP as a holy paladin it's the best weapon you can get. In WSG it's invaluable and for solo pvp it's pretty nice. For AB/AV and PvE it's more of a gimmick.

This!!I was able to use it as vanish before and it worked but now no chance.I use it when mobs aren't even close to me but i keep staying in combat and never dropping aggro.
---
They nerfed it for sure
---
Mage is broken
---
316 is way too high. 308 is about as high as you want to go as skill offers little benefit past that point.
---
Hey why the downvotes! I lol'd irl when I read this. (no it's not me in the screenshot lol)
---
Thanks for this,  I do wish there was more available through questing since finding groups is tough.
---
What‚Äôs up with going through gadgetzhan from ferelas to un goro. That‚Äôs messed up.
---
Eh I basically asked for it. Was my fault anyway ü§∑
---
You think that's the reason blizzard servers are lagging? Not the system they are using?
---
i think its fair to say its a ballance, look at retail if you want to see what making a game cater to the most casual audience does.
---
The "hardcore" croud having great gear , making content and pushing the limits of whats possible encourage people to the game and give new players something to aspire to be.
---
its like the complaints that server performance may impact world pvp in a big way, this is mostly a complaint from the more hardcore players but seeing amazing world pvp events will encourage both hardcore and casual players to try the game. seeing the game chug to 0.1fps in world pvp wont really encourage anyone to try the game.
---
im a no change guy personally but i feel its a balance, its a mistake to ignore either group because they feed off eachother
---
Was my bad for having hope.
---
It tracks with D&amp;D standards, that warlocks should have demonic.
---
If you ever Pvp you want the 1h and OH for offhand fuckery
---
Other than that they're similar enough In quality.
---
Got em
---
 Hmm, not that fast. It usually only takes me 1 hour and 10 minutes to hit level 10.
---
It is bugged for sure.And it worked before .Now i never drop combat with it like i did earlier in classic and like it was intended
---
I have questie, where does it mention info about the next part of the chain?
---
You talking about asmon 
---
In short you have to tag it and then deal damage to get credit
---
Ehh by the time the flight is over, your hearth will be off CD anyway
---
This is true. This picture doesn't bother me at all but checking I locked the front door 14 times then thinking I left the fridge door open and having to get out the front door again does bother me...
---
Is there any endgame content that is soloable as a rogue? I'd like to kill elites or bosses without having to find groups etc...
---
Vile creatures. I /spit on every gnome I see
---
I hope you gave him a /train for that /moo
---
Technically it used to be Human residences... might be why! I am Tauren myself and I always remember to de-mount on that part :d
---
I used it on imps in dm east to drop aggro and pass th to mine.Now its stealth nerfed and doesn't work like it should..
---
End game as in level 60 monsters? Lots.
---
End game as in level 60 dungeons or raids? Not the slimmest chance in the world.
---
nice for you... 10pm is more like 12-1am for me :(
---
Im not a young man anymore and I have kids. Im ready for bed by 9.30 :S
---
Youre wayyyyy overcalculating the worth of 305 wep skill vs a weapon that is bis
---
Gnolls paws..shouldn't every gnoll have 4..how am I not getting one??
---
You need to use edge masters handgaurds for it to be worthwhile with the axe
---
Undead are Cringe race. People who play undead like panic at the disco and    lost their virginity to a lesbian.
---
Holy paladin. Can level as melee (ret) for a change of pace and still heal most dungeons. They are in high demand and are also great in pvp if that's your thing.
---
Most have a level requirement.
---
Deathray is an oddball, not only does it not require gnomish, it doesnt have a level requirement, it actually doesn't require you to be an engineer at all after you get it, if for some reason you wanted to drop engi
---
Druid
---
Ive tried this 5+ times now as a Warlock and it has failed to remove me from combat every time.
---
Last week I was using it as a pseudo Vanish, now I can.t
---
When you land from a FP you get a buff called honorless target for 20 or 30 sec I think is what they mean.
---
No! Your the problem, Sir!
---
Wait..... I'm lost...
---
This has become one of my favorite things to do. I‚Äôve got my epic on my main and a nice bankroll. Got all other 7 classes between level 15-35, it‚Äôs so fun to twink them out with the best new gear every few levels. Especially on classes like warrior and rogue where a strong blue weapon makes you feel like a complete beast.
---
That's what the image is showing. Quest wants 15 gray bears and 4 black bears. They probably have 50-50 spawn ratio like stuff always does. (Or 33-33-33 in case of 3 different mobs.) And we end up with only black bears everywhere.
---
Love me a Capricciosa, just keep those anchovies off it please.
---
I can't remember exactly where, gadget maybe, but took me ages to get into a building. Not mounted, I just didn't fit. Eventually got the right angle and got in.
---
Might have been booty bay actually. Someplace made fo small people anyway.
---
why are you even on a pvp server
---
This is by design.
---
Respawn points aren't mob specific. So when people prioritize Gray bears, black bears stay up and the remaining spawn locations are split between black and gray.
---
This is why it's important to kill all mobs, and not just the one specific mob you're looking for.
---
Horde on ally here. Had an hour or two battle with alliance at Hope's Chapel last night. They definitely were more organized but it pushed both ways back and forth. Great pvp fun, excited for phase 2 on Stalagg!
---
He's speaking in dipshitian but he means that, when transfers were announced, a vast number of people were in every discussion thread were warning people against availing themselves of the service, especially transfers for the sake of escaping queues.
---
Is this true?

---
:) Glad you enjoyed!
---
I would argue no. Mace spec does not give 5% crit nor 5% double attack like the other styles, which makes the slight increase in damage less useful.
---
Yes it is slow, but there are other slow weapons too.
---
Most chests in a camp or whatnot share a spawn limit. So if one is up, whatever the contents, then it will stay up until it‚Äôs emptied, and no more can spawn until that happens. Some places have a 2 chest limit. If no chests are up it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre on cooldown and will repop in time.
---
If a drunk prot paladin can do it, anyone can!
---
&gt; You should never use Bite in place of Claw or your pet will be sitting there with unspent focus. 
---
You're a noob. Do you even play hunter?
---
This is the stupidest thing i've ever read.
---
Exactly this, I had my warden staff for P1 but now I'm using a mail with iron counterweight (when I'm not using a pummeler that is)
---
Never have the intro comments on World of Roguecraft been so relevant.
---
Nobody ever chased down the enemy knowing exactly when that buff expires. Nor the people running to said flight path to leave the zone. High level neutral areas should be hotbeds.
---
Huh?
---
The problem is the flight master doesn't have a nest or hay or whatever the fuck around him so its just like another random npc.
---
fuck that quest
---
Saw a video of a naked rogue beating high end pvp boys up. Doesn't get much more gear independent imo
---
Sunken temple will always be there keeping the enemy faction from ganking you. So will BRD. And BRD. And the rest of the instances.
---
In the shadow lands expansion?
---
Will there be class changes in phase 2?
---
C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!
---
But that is like 6 months or more out.
---
fuck that quest more than any other
---
Dude that thread is asking for druids to get an out of combat res with no cd.  Rebirth has always in every version of wow been usable outside of combat.  Idk if you're trolling or just big dumb at this point.
---
you dont install it
---
its simple
---
So should I stick with arms and prot spec? This is my first character and I've been running brd like crazy and found that unlike all instances before where I could tank no problem with two hander I have to use a shield in there and I was wondering if I should switch to fury for the attack speed stuff or stay arms for the bleeds and overpowers?
---
Crit isn't 15 spell damage. It's around 9
---
I dunno. Disarm trap seems fairly clutch for BWL. It's also pretty good for distract, threat wiping, and other useful abilities. Rogues are quite an awesome class.
---
Fisting must have a different meaning where you come from
---
Guidelime is free and works very well.
---
All the people saying "its not that bad" are Horde... easy thing to say when you dont feel the ratio in such a negative way. 
---
It really sucks that classic was a good chance for Blizzard to enforce some sort of faction balancing, but #nochanges I guess...
---
I've been doing some Dire Maul East farming on my holy priest. The majority of your gold will be from the vendoring grey items that sell for somewhere around 60c each. You'll also occasionally get weapon and armor drops that sell for a good amount too. As a holy priest I still feel like it's worthwhile to farm. I'm also an herbalist so I get a good amount of Dreamfoil and Gromsblood too.
---
He probably didn't see, again because you just showed up there without telling anyone.
---
Manage your res sickness better imo.
---
Camping people for no reason is griefing by definition.
---
You don't need Pre-raid bis though.
---
The number of people that think Pre-raid bis is necessary is too damn high. 
---
It makes easy content easier.
---
You will need the IF flight path. It's a nexus hub and the won't connect without it.
---
camping ppl 20v1 is griefing.
---
I‚Äôd say it was only easy cause you went in with an experienced guild... imagine there being only a few guys that have every done Mc and the rest beginners.. it would not be ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô at all and take way more time then a ‚Äòsmooth‚Äô run, where 90% of the raid has been doing it for years...
---
Yeah mages, just stack the enemys up and use Blizzard! /S!
---
the reason is it's a pvp server LOL
---
I... I need to call an ambulance I think I‚Äôm having a stroke.
---
Why would they waste the time? You really wanna grief someone and don‚Äôt care about the time investment you will just do it on a lvl 60
---
Deathbringer &gt; 2% hit
---
Well that‚Äôs what a twink is... not meant to hit level 60?
---
Oh god, fuck that quest. I was just doing that last one before going to quest with my friend in ungoro. I told my friend what quest I was doing and he said, "oh that will only take you a minute, it drops first try"... Cut to 45 minutes of killing dew laden thistlegrubs before giving up and going to ungoro.
---
Right?? You get junk to sell from it, mats sometimes, and most of all xp. Better than running around doing nothing looking for wolves.
---
3840 health...... with no buffs
---
Goretusk livers would **not** like to know your location
---
I‚Äôm sure there will be groups of premade 39s cutting about STV, and maybe some 29s in Stonetalon/Ashenvale. Any zones lower than that are usually not contested, and the ones that are are quite difficult to reach for the opposing faction (Redridge, Wetlands)
---
No as in the time investment of sitting and waiting to kill people. You get nothing for it yet until bgs come out.
---
Spec doesn't matter for dungeons. Hell spec doesn't matter for raids. Put on a shield, stack that stamina, be in defensive stance and you'll do fine.
---
I say this because for a raid  boss like Major Domo where they want many offtanks, a lot of HP and a shield is all my raid asks of the DPS warrior, not a full respec into prot.
---
You're shooting yourself in the foot here. The people saying mage and spriest are absolutely correct. You will not have fun as a blue geared rogue once everyone else is in tier 2.
---
I was on course last night and saw some classic addons for BIS gear
---
That's exactly why am gonna play who doesn't want to be a an undead Kung Fu Panda
---
Son of a bitch
---
So that's why I can't log on...
---
Grobbulus is basically one of the most active and healthy (balance wise) servers right now according to everyone on this sub.
---
I wouldn't bother unless you're an herbalist, not worth it otherwise.
---
You get honor in wPVP.
---
Yeah I realize that lol. But being a caster is not appealing to me at all :(
---
who could possibly be leveling still
---
But honour on a twink is useless at this stage, you can‚Äôt get anything.
---
I've seen this before ! Some one yells out what they want to drop and it did !
---
Well yes, of course, you need rogues in bwl and they do amazing dps.
---
I didn't mean to short change them at all, if that's how it came across. Their awesome dps is still their calling card, which is very good.
---
This one ain't even that bad
---
The real shit is getting the Silverman Howler to spawn and not the Silverman Stalker
---
*Fuck* those wolfs, there are like 15 stealthed ones for each non stealthed

If you are in range of a party member in combat it will put you in combat as well. I've been screwed out of a charge on many occasions because of this

Yep! Faerlina died again. May be going for downtime record from the looks of it.
---
All the servers are down now. Nobody can get on. Blizzard CS twitter hasn‚Äôt tweeted anything at the moment.
---
But yeah, Faerlina is gonna take a shit on Tuesday and Thursday when layers are removed and then PvP on Thursday. 
---
Multi billion dollar company....

EDIT: blizzard just tweeted about it a minute ago...

It is horrible, go with just about any other guide
---
As long as no one goes over 200 dps they shouldn't have a problem!
---
The Charred Vale quests in Stonetalon have a lot of that going on.
---
XP is XP baby
---
How was DM released too early? It‚Äôs a dungeon that‚Äôs has nothing to do with anything else. Was ragefire chasm releases too early too?
---
I have a similar spec and MC isn't as bad as conventional wisdom would have one believe.  Switching to frostbolt on Baron, Golemagg, and Rag (most importantly) makes DPS maybe 20% lower for those bosses than it would be for frost spec.  But for the other bosses fire DPS is higher than frost if you have a curse of elements.
---
nice
---
I feel like this should get more love.
---
I would use any gear that gives necessary stats for tanking or gives some form of thorns.
---
Literally why I skipped that wpl bear quest
---
Thank you I think this is my best work
---
Keeps saying that ive been disconnected from blizzard services. I cant even swap servers to play my other characters.
---
It also still claims that all the servers are A-OK on  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-us](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status/classic-us)

So glad I rolled on a pve server. Also stop whining about pvp on a pvp server.
---
Twinks are ready. At least level 19 twinks as they are really easy to spin up with a few hundred gold and a friend carrying.
---
Transfers from Arugal are about to open so you‚Äôll have some alliance incoming

Is there an addon to see talents?

Change that to 1k DPS because we have some of the highest TPS in the game!

---
Is this movie worth watching? Every clip I ever see of it is really strange and offputting but it seems like there's tons of fans of it. Like I saw the business card scene and was like... this is really weird -- what does this have to do with the plot? I know the plot of the movie roughly but still.
---
I take that as a compliment
---
Just a +1 to this. 2H warrior DpS is still great. You can rock the hell out of five mans with 2H DPS. Raids get iffy because of losing that debuff slot and therefore no mortal strike.
---
I ask myself that every single Friday and Saturday night.
---
Best in slot really doesn't apply here
---
Blizzard making changes (free server transfers) had a negative affect on the game. Who could have seen this coming.
---
This is the exact case for one of the plaguelands quests
---
It's back up
---
I didn't get a small business loan to leveling my enchanting. Why do you think a cheeseburger at McDonald's costs $1 when they pay $.05 for the ingredients? The overhead of running a business.
---
You think thats bad, look at the chinese server ËåÉÂÖãÁëûÊñØ lol
---
I was iffy bout it .. But after using it i would pay souble for it. So many options if u dont like 1 area just load in anotjer zone ... Would honestly rate it a 8.5/10
---
Trying to figure this out as well. The /who only showing 49 people? Idk.
---
 It is known.
---
Yeah I'm working on getting my second toon there. Holy/ret pally at 45 currently.
---
My 3rd, 4th, and 5th toons are all mid 20s so I will anything and everything that moves.
---
I didn't expect phase 2 until like Xmas so I thought I had more time to get more toons to 60
---
it's a great feeling mate, hopefully when you do it's a goodie :)
---
Not true, if someone takes 1 item from a chest, it will disappear after a short time. About the same amount of time it takes a corpse to despawn.
---
I'd like to consider myself very good at macros, but what's with the null inside of that first castsequence?
---
Have you tried "za warudo"?
---
for maybe 20 mins there were less than 50 people on at once, thought it was cool but whatever
---
As you can tell by the other replies, what class you pick matters less than the fact that you can/are willing to heal.
---
If you want to be in demand then roll feral druid, tank your way to 60, the respec resto. You can still heal as feral in most lower level dungeons. Otherwise level each class to 10 or so and pick the one you like.
---
I'm from stonespine too, honestly was very surprised by that figure. I always felt it was horde favoured but I didnt think it was *that* much. 
---
Luckily for us then that horde on stonespine are pretty chill compared to the asshats at skeram. Most  zones they don't attack except obviously for the hell that is blackrock mountain.
---
Fire elementals in stonetalon spring to mind immediately.
---
Few patches in the future mate.
---
The who list only shows a Max of 49 people
---
Because nobody wants to watch nasty-ass horde races fucking each other.
---
So PVPers are pieces of shit?
---
It shows 49 max u muppet
---
I dont think its that bad tbh
---
DM has huge impact for casuals. It gives a lot of pre raid bis or alternatives to other harder to get items and there‚Äôs already so many op items.
---
this is EVERY MMO ever at level 1-10
---
Why are people trying to use /world? There's already the official LFG channel.
---
I have noticed that this kind of thing is WAY better in classic than it was in vanilla. It used to be godawful, now it's merely annoying.
---
IMO, Scatter shot + Entrapment + Imp spamclip are mandatory especially in battleground.
---
On the most geared list by class on my realm I see guildies with less gear than me but I'm not on there &gt;:c
---
Not only that, but its good way to boost your exp, Im lvling my alt hunter now and i lay waste to everything in my path, couldnt always do it with warrior.
---
and you're giving them exactly what they want by making a reddit post whining about it
---
they can lock the channel and enjoy being alone in their private channel
---
For raiding - druids
---
For 5 mans - anything (slightly less so for druids because no normal res)
---
Read the book
---
I posted about this and it was removed from here because it's an exploit or something. But yeah, delete char, have friend take name, request character back. There are no name locks. This is how we used to do it before the name change service. Back in the day they'd only restore a character a few times though. Not sure if it applies to today if everyone is abusing it.
---
They have a system in place in retail to prevent stuff like that from happening, and it wouldn't surprise me if it was also implemented in classic to prevent people from doing that kind of stockpiling.
---
That being said, large brilliant shards are so low in value that you may as well stockpile regardless
---
I'm so confused
---
That's only possible from Horde talking to Alliance IIRC.
---
Before you think about selfish you should look it up. A cat is just superior, a cat does about 80-100Dps compared to a Wolf with 30-40Dps spamming Furious Howl every 10 Seconds. Furious Howl has a 15 yard range means you either Buff yourself or the Melees. If you are a Horde you will have 3 Melee Class and in Alliance 4 Melee Class in your GRP. Lets say you are Alliance, Furious Howl adds about 50 DMG to the next Attack. 4 Melees mean 200 DMG, divided to 10 CD of Furious Howl equals about 20 DPS gain, add that to the Melee DMG of your Wolf = 50-60 DPS. 
---
Using a Wolf will make your Raid lose about 30-50 DPS.
---
So were they publicly picking teams or what
---
Mc was lame even during vanilla. You wont find aq and naxx oame
---
alchemy would be for xmutes
---
Recently, a friend of mine had an issue where he tried to use a portal of a mage, while the mage was simultaneously leaving the group.  The result was a world server is down message.
---
The guild I was raiding with had 12 healers so I decided to focus on disc with a bit of holy as a priest for PI on mages.
---
Imagine being told you have low HPS when there is literally nothing to heal since you're not assigned to tanks and every other person is sniping with their fastest heal.
---
I realized it was vanilla when me and my 2 friends were level 7 still doing the boar quest in the Tauren starting area
---
Auraduration
---
To be fair to them though, I'd also be pretty angsty if I had to live in mud huts with no running water.
---
Because they put a password on a chat channel?
---
Don't fly into any contested zones flight path, because they will be camped.  Thorium Point will be a meat grinder.
---
The problem is you can easily make 10-15g by transmuting essence of undeath to water. It locks you out of transmuting Arcanite, and to top it off it has half the cooldown.
---
He didn‚Äôt drop loot in my run last night. Just bad RNG I believe
---
rly tho how
---
Well at least OP learned something today.
---
If someone is "telling you you have low HPS", they don't understand how vanilla healing works.
---
This really needs to be a loading screen tip
---
Even with minimal PvP (1-3 days a week killing people), you should get it in about 3 weeks.
---
shows max of 50 and the list went down to 46 before server went down
---
I might be wrong. But if you only use one of the 3. It should be possible to make a macro that just has /cast 3 times, each time for one of the trinkets. The cast should try to cast everything at once, which would then activate whatever trinket you have currently on.
---
Rag was killed like 80 days after domo for the first time. In classic I am mad if my pug wipes in MC once.
---
Why would you waste time skinning on an alt lol
---
Yeah that's pretty much why I quit. If some idiot is telling me I have low HPS and he's an officer / class leader what other dumb shit is he going to come up with.
---
I just did this 2 days ago. But there's some nice spots with a heap of clustered spawn points, so by the time you kill your 8th spider, the 1st spawn point is refreshing. No need to leave and come back.
---
I mean, if you aren't 60 yet you aren't really relevant. You've already missed out on the good stuff.
---
Damn, wish I sold mine on the neutral AH. Probably could have got more.
---
Just hear to show love for the key ring
---
That looked fun af
---
Stalagg is rough as Alliance. Every once in a while there's a pocket of them who will fight over a FP or instance, but then they leave the Horde come back in force. I also find that many don't get tired of camping areas, even when a graveyard is feet away. I almost never start pvp fights just as a matter of course, but now I won't do it because with one defense chat call a group will come. Several people I play with are looking to leave at first opportunity and are dreading phase 2. Even though I just made 60, I think I'd like to actually be able to play the game instead of being ganged up on all the time. I only got to 60 in time because I focused almost entirely on zones green for me. I thankfully also haven't had much issue with being camped. I have a macro that does the chicken emote and I just spam it when ganged up on. It seems to get the point across and they're gone by the time I spawn.
---
my retail toon is still 110
---
fuck BFA
---
Batch auto shot and melee into one button, when you pull threat off your pet send your pet onto the next mob.
---
You wanna get into a rhythm where you auto, tab, melee, tab, auto and so on.
---
Youll only use aimed shot if you break rhythm, and multi in between autos when you get the chance.
---
Does anyone know a good screen capturing software that isn't too challenging for crappy PCs?
---
So if I have 10 trinkets that (at different times) I swap into my bottom slot, I have a macro that just says /cast name of trinket and then have 10 lines that all say that?
---
And it would work?
---
I'm not finding people in my guild either https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/kromcrush/forbinai
---
Did you get a screenshot of that?
---
What do you use to say that a majority thinks that DM was released too early? The results clearly show 40% of people thinking it was good, 15% thinking it was bad and the rest being indifferent. If I had to draw a conclusion, I would first say that the majority does not care and then more people thought it was good than bad.
---
Unless it‚Äôs an instacast like counterspell right?
---
This better not awaken anything within me
---
pervert!
---
It is going too fast. It killed the guild I‚Äôm in as everyone is waiting to see what it‚Äôll be like(they weren‚Äôt pserver players so don‚Äôt know yet). I spent all this time getting 60 and I‚Äôm stopping any pve next week to respec into shadow and just mess around once a week. So yeah I‚Äôm 60 but may even unsub until phase 3. I‚Äôm not corpse hopping into every dungeon. You can link me this now.

6/8 Shadowcraft 2/2 devilsaur is definitely BiS for rogues. The set bonus for SC procs so much that nothing can compete with it. Back in the day for like AQ40, rogues with full t2 would switch to 6/8 of Darkmantle just for the set bonus, which is just a "slightly" better shadowcraft.
---
That being said, it's not like truestrike and cardaverous is shit but generally best part of cardaverous is the chest piece...everything else there are better pieces out there and the set bonuses aren't anything special
---
Now that's just sad.
---
But how does that make them pieces of shit?
---
They rolled on a PVP server.
---
They are PVPing.
---
It's alliance vs horde...
---
I really can't understand the mindset of some people who roll on a PVP server then complain they only want to PVP when it's fair and when they want to PVP.
---
If you want that then that's literally what a PVE server is....
---
Pally messed up by bubbling too early
---
I hope for transcendence EU, THAT balance is not right! If so DAMN WE ARE FUCKED!
---
It's OK to have content the vast majority of the player base will never achieve.
---
If they are shared spawns, it looks like this because the last player killed all the grey bears and left all of the black bears.
---
amazing help you are doing, a month after he needed it. good job =)
---
what are you spamming the entire time onys in the air?
---
Trinket 1 is slot 13, trinket 2 is slot 14 (if I can remember correctly and the source I saw on Google was correct).
---
So a /use 14 will always activate whatever trinket is in that slot.
---
Your "friend" huh
---
Good 'ole Kurinaxx. Love this server. 
---
Balanced enough and active on both sides.
---
*hands quest giver bucket of red mush*
---
"your livers, sir"
---
yOu rEkT hiM Haha xDDDDDD
---
The point is why can't it fix both?
---
Druid, arent many decent ones around, probs cuz they have no res so 5mans are annoying.
---
Respect for the 1 v 1
---
As a horde player on Yojamba it feels reasonably balanced, with certain zones being controlled by one faction more often than the other.
---
Searching the logs above I couldn‚Äôt locate any of the alliance guys (in MC gear) I often see in Burning Steppes, but I could see myself, guildies and those in other guilds on horde side.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt take it as strictly accurate, I think horde is slightly more competitive so we all publicly upload our logs. It‚Äôs got to be somewhere between 60:40 and 55:45 horde dominant.
---
Thanks! I was getting towards the point of playing long enough that I should know, but didn't.
---
I'm on Stonespine EU Hordeside. Organised a number of census with the Alliance via the Stonespine Discord over the past few months.
---
In September we had ~9500 Horde ~5500 Alliance online when we had queues (that brief week).
---
After all the Spanish people transferred off to Mandokir and Census was reenabled we ran some more Census tests and the server was 63% Horde / 37% Alliance. Horde peak is around 3000-3500 players online. Alliance is around 1800-2000 at peak.
---
It‚Äôs also pretty bad in BC, especially in Outland
---
OGRE SHAMANS IN FERALAS!!!! So terrible
---
I may be low level but cheap shot on a priest can make a splash before I get instantly AOE‚Äôd
---
Mage single target is tough to level, sooo much drinking time
---
Do you feel like the ratio is close to be true?
---
Just asking as I play horde on Noggenfogger, and I thought it was more around 40% ally.
---
Because the game is all about max level now? Makes sense that you would bring players into the actual game asap, similar to games like destiny and diablo. No point making people slog 10 days /played in 10 year old questing content that everybody has done already, just to reach the actual gameplay
---
Someone is mad they got rolled by a melee priest.

The fact that he breaks and loses it at the end gives me much joy
---
This website is not updated as frequently as the in-game server selection screen. The site is updated once an hour at most.
---
how are there people who play 3 hours a day every day and aren't 60? Don't they quest or do dungeons? what do they even do, stand around in IF?
---
Did someone say Zhevra hooves?
---
They all passed to me, no drama. Thats our guilds first staff of dom too.
---
We use the system where you nominate your top X items and loot council is done around that. I was only one with the staff and robes, apart from one pally.
---
I've invested 200 hours into an alliance warlock, and am level 56, so I'm not sure how standard that amount of time is for that level of character, but I have managed to get into a good guild and plan to raid with them. 
---
My god, Felstriker is much lower than Yojamba than I originally thought!
---
Phase 2 hasn't even started yet and people already talking about TBC...
---
Alliance would say that.
---
Nah I told them all how much was left and the reasons why. Fairly open and communicative about the issue.
---
Its worth 100 times more
---
[Westfall is comparable too, because what you're looking at is where you can find things.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/238154617685278720/623862606557609986/unknown.png)

Well that's because you ruined the mask by repeatedly stabbing them in the face. With a hammer.
---
Firemaw with most ppl on it. hell yea i made the right choice!
---
What‚Äôs the add on for combat text like that?
---
Couldnt find a version that works. Could you send a link kind sir?
---
You do realize you can kite things with conc shot, scatter shot and wing clip, right?
---
Your pet stopped being a damage sponge the moment you hit 60 and respecced to MM, unless you want to give it 10 seconds of free damage and/or FD so it keeps aggro on mobs.
---
From now on, you either kite stuff or become a melee hunter if you're too lazy to do that.
---
This is what TBC should have been. They shouldn't have ever released an xpac with a level increase imo. Just release the raids you mentioned with loot and tier sets to make offspecs viable. Make the Karazhan tier set make ret viable, have the hyjal raid drop a tier set with a bonus that rewards mana when the prot pally is healed. Ect.
---
Sometimes the quest text actually gives you a lore reason. When it does, it means it'll drop off 1 in 50 instead of 1 in 5
---
&gt;that‚Äôs why a good portion of its users spend their time browsing the forums/Reddit rather than playing the game.
---
Wasn't this the sub that was bragging about how much more active the classic wow sub is over the normal wow one? You get a lot more time to browse reddit when you have 10 minute flight paths around the place and only have to press one button to do anything :)
---
I killed them all. Not only the rock elementals, but the rock  elewomentals and rock elechildrentals too
---
Cant find a working version. Could you send a link?
---
Way I got mine was to do a tribute run, but kill Krom. You lose one blue in the chest but gain a blue from him
---
\*laughs in warlock*
---
Well that sounds awesome, glad you‚Äôre getting to play your desired spec with what sounds like a good group of people. And I hope you‚Äôre not on my server/battlegroup once you get AQ gear.
---
\#nochanges ?
---
I've barely had any problems at all on faerlina. People like to sensationalize everything because it's the "streamer" server but it's not bad.
---
Just not worth the risk transferring to a server that may end up dead.
---
Fit through just fine with my cow boi on his wolf ;D
---
I didn't realize this place was in classic.
---
Yup. Blizzard really messed up the OCE servers. Felstriker was released wayyy later, when everyone already had invested into Arugal/Yojamba. 
---
I'd say if you already found a guild, then stick with it. In the future if the server really 'dies' they will most likely merge it with Yojamba.
---
What‚Äôs more likely. White mane has the exact same split as every other big server and you are wrong that it was an exact 50-50 at launch or only alliance transferred out of every single balanced server for some reason.
---
Missed his grenade too.
---
Nice man :)
---
Lok'tar bitches!
---
Just go to the twitch addon page and search for it, it's on there. i just added it yesterday and it works fine.
---
Username checks out
---
You have to find the right group, I think the ones on the east of that area have a higher drop rate. Also, for the Lt rings, just go straight to the back of the canyon, none of them in front will drop rings. Hopefully I saved someone some time with this comment.
---
Will I use it for anything?
---
Don‚Äôt forget a couple of spare innervates
---
There's actually a reason why this happens sometimes. Adds can share spawn points and it's possible that someone killed a bunch of grey bears and a bunch of black bears spawned.
---
I remember having a quest in WPL to kill diseased wolves but and thought it was weird that I only saw the same 2 in the whole zone. I read that the spider shared spawns so I killed all of them in a certain area and viola - a bunch more wolves started to spawn.
---
The only way to make it a challenge would to be do a 1.0 release which isnt reasonable. Or they could have retuned the fights with all our gear and talents in mind.
---
Yes it's only to darnssus/thunder bluff but it's free
---
You sound dumb as fuck
---
free real estate out there
---
Gotcha!!! Thanks for the help
---
yeah they did.
---
they're removing layers from the remaining realms first and then it's the 14th for phase 2
---
what do you mean by those servers? us easr or pvp? what servers would you recommend and why?
---
Servers couldn‚Äôt handle the test launch, then they couldn‚Äôt handle the real launch. What makes you think blizzard actually cares if their servers can handle the player base or not? Because I see no signs of them caring too much.
---
It's nice but not required.
---
I don't think it's too much to ask for a server to work from a paid service provided by a multi billion dollar company in 2019.
---
Yea dude you're still arguing against people who agree with you.
---
The original comment was "No R14 gear is bis for the full game", not "No, R14 gear is bis for the full game"
---
Private server players tend to be pretty good at the game, Alliance players don't. It's a paradox!
---
Because initially, it was the only city with an Auction House. It's also where the Honor Hall is, and where you turn in Nef &amp; Ony heads. It's close to WSG battleground portal, Ony's Lair and Azuregos spawn. It has a zep that lets you access North Eastern Kingdoms (AV &amp; AB) or South Eastern Kingdoms (ZG and flight straight to Kargath) easily.
---
I prefer using TB due to the good vendors, bank and AH all being next to each other, but there is a trade-off that if you want to get to Eastern Kingdoms, it's gonna take a decent while.
---
Warlock - good class lore, good class quests (the best maybe?), free mount at 40, discounted mount at 60 with a cool quest, great looking gear, probably the better (and more fun) pvp class and demons are less fussiness vs hunter pets.
---
Hunter - better rotations at end game, easiest class to play but one of the tough ones to play really well, dps drops off as the tiers progress, less in demand on the servers I've played, pets may be more fussy but if you are into the pet thing it's the only class that has a deep pet system like that, when they drop off in later tiers you may be bought along just for tranq shot.
---
Downside of hunter is you need to carry ammo and you need to feed your pets, downside of locks is you need to farm shards (not as big a deal as non locks will say but it takes up space) and turn up earlier to raids as you will be expected to help summon (teleport) people to the raid location.
---
Professions are up to you, you could take a gathering and a production one (like skinning and leatherworking) to make gear or you could go lazy mode and take 2 gathering for money that way. If you want to PVP a lot engineering is a great one as it will make useful PVP items). Maybe take a read over them all and see what jumps out for you, as long as you aren't taking an armour making profession on a character who can't wear that armor type and make sure what you take works together (like herbalism to get mats to do alchemy) you will be ok.
---
Best advice would be to find what appeals to you the most, do you like the idea of throwing out spells or shooting arrows? Do you like the idea of taming pets or summoning demons to do your will? I find that's what will help you stick more. If you don't care either way then yeah both are in kind of similar spots imo, both are easy to level, both will be ok end game, both can bring utility. It's tough to judge early on though, I don't think you get a fair view of the classes until around level 20.
---
maybe ask him in a whisper - he may have forgotten to equip or he's had shitty luck.
---
The carrot isn't exactly easy to get and the luffa he may have missed due to not levelling/questing in ungoro. 
---
maybe he just levelled by doing dungeons and never got a trinket to drop.
---
BUT Kudos to you for trying to add him to help him out :)
---
So no picture of what you‚Äôre describing, got it.
---
Ah this must be why there are no wolves in WPL and spiders everywhere
---
Null basically stops it from repeating. So it will cast once, then stop that sequence for good until a new job is selected. 
---
Its pretty smart, and I'm thinking of altering my su per tank macro to include it.
---
Now I want some lunch

I dont think having the first tier of raids be so easy its upsetting when you wipe in a pub is fine.

Quests at 60 give bank, i saved most of the last 5 levels of zone quests as much as possible to get gold
---
The AH take is higher on the weekend, that's all
---
Yeah its the most logical reason lmao. Unless you have insider information there is no for sure way of knowing though
---
Relax dude
---
I think horde has the edge on the server but I gotta say alliance does really well, I play horde and my alt get fucked up all day :)
---
Ps. Also my main is a 60 priest. We have enough healers.
---
There's a 14g fee for not taking a real screenshot
---
Thanks, I was so confused.
---
Should I train first-aid on my druid?
---
Are you very experienced in GSE? I'm having trouble getting it to equip a weapon, charge, and switch stances. Is there a delay or something from when you equip an item to when you can cast again?
---
No, you just fuck up the spawn. Like most people do.
---
Oh yeah you can flag on PvE servers, but if you get killed while flagged idk why you'd be mad at the other person. If you didn't wanna get ganked just don't flag lol
---
I've tried that twice since noticing the problem. Still nothing.
---
The cost of your haircut does factor in the rent of the shop and the insurance otherwise they wouldn't be operating.

mmm lunch...

Content has a different meaning to us then. I get some nice gear off pvp rep but the big draw is playing against other people. Unlike AI that will always do the same thing or similar things people can be unpredictable at times

Not enough mana

Those armrests are unforgivable on such an expensive chair. Cheap plastic with no padding. How do your elbows cope?

Eh I don‚Äôt think so but thanks haha, I‚Äôm not sad anyways

Server downtime is blizzlike.

Engineering is 100% a must for 'serious' tanking.

I'd go alchemy 2nd if you like not leaving org to make gold, mining if you wanna 2man jump runs

This Is true, don't know why downvoted
---
It's not something that you need to do immediately, but later on it's worth having.
---
PSA: Tauren on wolf does fit through most doors
---
Well honestly that much gold is a lot to someone in my position, I‚Äôm still leveling. I‚Äôd like to make those kind of moves but it wasn‚Äôt really plausible for me :D
---
First aid is a mana free heal, and you can easily level it from cloth drops. 100% worth it
---
playing EVEN 1h/a day and still being 48 is almost impossible. how did you even manage that lol
---
Then stay and enjoy the shitshow.
---
Blizzard made you an offer, and you declined it.
---
IF you are clicking on your macros you may want to make sure your bar is locked. If you are using key presses I got nothing.
---
I wish I could transfer off my server. I didn't know it was the unofficial Portuguese server until halfway to 60
---
&gt; Those servers will be deader then dead in a month or two
---
people said the same thing about classic
---
and yet
---
here we are, where even "medium" population servers are still very lively
---
Yo it really was and the xp was amazing for my alt
---
It's always good to train first aid no matter what. I can't hurt and also at higher levels you can use it to make cloth worth more before tossing to vendor.
---
Zhevra hooves... bitch I can see you got 4 of them where they at
---
Upvoted you for asking a game related question instead of fishing for upvotes/attention with a picture of your cat on your keyboard or screenshot of a Tauren in a bikini
---
Inb4 someone steals my idea and actually uploads a picture of a Tauren in a bikini-like outfit
---
I can get behind some of them. Sure in your murdering you may fuck up a coyote tail and need a couple extra.
---
But like you said how in the flying fuck can I cann a coyote in a way that remove ALL BLOOD.
---
Woah dude, don't worry about your rank just yet, it seems like you're still in The Barrens.

Just own up to being a serial killer for hire that collects trophies from each victim
---
The satyr one azshara...
---
The normal satyrs only have 2 spawns and you need 6 killed.
---
The other 2 have 4 spawns each and you only need 2.
---
kromkrush!
---
Then the problem is upgraded gear in general. That's... Really stupid though.
---
I wonder what the effect would be to increase the raids in Azeroth to 70 and give equal gear to what you get in Outlands (but different sets/tiers). How that would effect end-game and raiding.
---
Would keep a healthy population of 70s in Azeroth at least.
---
You cannot fly from continent to continent, only within the continent you are at. You will need to go to theramore and take the boat to menethil harbor.
---
How do you get that much gear, and even hand of fucking rag, and still be this bad at the game
---
Yes! Rejuv + max level bandage is almost full hp.
---
I‚Äôm going to make your life a lot easier:
---
Razor Gauntlets
---
Naglering 
---
Reflect damage Trinket off Ragnaros 
---
Immolation Potion
---
Paladins
---
Druid or Warlock
---
Force Reactive Disks
---
Grenades
---
These are all tools to maintain AoE threat outside of your core class features. I suggest having a Nagle and Razor Gauntlets. The trinket will come eventually. Those three are all drops. After that, favor taking one of the three reflect damage classes.
---
If all else fails, engineers have the Force Reactive Disk and grenade with the reflect items to maximize AoE threat.
---
You have to logout correctly. If you alt-f4 out, macros will delete.
---
I mean I use thorium because I have a million bars from mining. Free damage is free damage.
---
Depends on your wand and how well you can kite. Also if you are trying to level quickly then pots make a big difference and aren't expensive at lower levels.
---
Hey, when Bliz said paladins were made for casuals, they didn't just mean the player playing the paladin! ;)
---
With the discovery of Greater BoK, I don't think threat is much issue tbh.
---
I‚Äôm a raid leader and I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre playing the same game. We‚Äôve been progressing on MC for 3 weeks now and we‚Äôre about to put attempts into Rag tomorrow. Is this really the sentiment towards MC?
---
Hunter leveling is: Send pet &gt; auto shot &gt; alt tab to Netflix.
---
Fearlina is STILL majority horde even with Olympus. It‚Äôs currently ~60/40 Horde favored based on  active players from the last two weeks. If they have too many Alliance then all servers are fucked.
---
Why MMO mouse? I've never understood it. They're heavy which many would say is objectively bad, the keybinds are absolutely not needed for playing any MMORPG currently on the market, not to mention the fact that they're often way overpriced for what you get if you're paying for some quality. Not trying to be an ass or anything, just wondering what use people see in them, or if it's just due to successfull marketing that people buy into it.
---
With the data addon there's so much clutter in my minimap that I actually miss herbs. I'm more efficient without the data or the addon for that matter. Hopefully it's better for other professions.
---
Stonkade pauldrons are prebis for prot warriors if you can afford it.
---
No shield tanking drastically harms your survivability in AoE pulls. Without block or an obscene amount of armor (looking at 10k+ on Druids right now) its better to add in reflective damage gear
---
Yep. I'll add (as someone in the OG beta) that plainsrunning was super flavorful but also SUCKED. Any damage broke it. Instead of being able to mount after a short cast time, it took 10 seconds to get up to max speed. Most Tauren learned to do odd stuff like running in circles to maintain their mounted speed. Stopping for a second to respond to a tell meant 10 seconds to build back up to mounted speed. It was a bad gaming experience. Even with the issues with Kodos, having a Kodo is an improvement.
---
Holy Paladin PvP or Prot Farming
---
It's only better at getting snap threat, which you only need if your dps dont wait 2 seconds for you to get threat. It's worse at everything else. Unless you are doing speed runs, getting all the world buffs, and max consumables, then it's a shit spec.
---
Constantly getting perma sheeped by 25 horde mages while alliance players ignore your struggle just to get farmed too
---
Be it retail or classic, alliance is a dead faction, forever
---
Thank you!! It‚Äôs been a tough choice, I like the spells and pets both so I haven‚Äôt locked in the choice yet but you‚Äôre advice was really helpful
---
My group had hunter instead of warlock and mage as the fifth. We also split professions up between us. Turned out to be a really good group - always have a MT in warrior, potential for OT and OH on druid, totems/heals/dps from shaman, range, pet, and trap CC on hunter, and CC/vending machine on mage. It was a great group to hit 60 with and still doing dungeons together now.
---
Maybe! I haven‚Äôt gotten very farm with my priest alt!
---
Doubt it. When most did progress raids in wotlk/tbc you knew what to do perfectly anyway. In MC there is nothing to learn/do compared to those raids.
---
Thank you!
---

---
I‚Äôd say 30% super nice folks 60% neutral folk and 10% bastards. And a lot of time the neutral folk turn to super nice after you‚Äôre with them for an hour or so (quests or dungies) Keep your chin up. Maybe it‚Äôs your server?
---
&gt; This is exactly why some people roll on PvP servers.
---
This is not why...  Look for a mass exodus to come after phase 2.  People will quit or xfer.
---
Haven‚Äôt heard this one yet, thanks for the advice!
---
Nope never had a issue with threat. The only thing geting in the way of my ability of tanking now is alcholol.
---
Anybody know how much the AV mounts will cost? Didn‚Äôt it drastically reduce price in 1.12?
---
Excellent movie - it's a horror comedy that's a satire about 1980s materialism and vanity
---
Don't use Shield Block on CD.
---
Is there a limit as to how much you can raid?  for example, i joined a molten core pug today starting from gar and for the next few bosses.  so im assuming that tomorow i wouldnt be able to join a new group and do it all over?
---
Umm not even close
---
No, any YouTuber recommendations?
---
Very nice!
---
Negative, I have a wife for that.
---
Hunter prio!
---
Ayy Fairbanks represent!
---
Your experience sounds fairly similar to mine... minus the hunter part. Priest is my only character/main.
---
Thank you!!
---
Clearly a rogue in disguise
---
You could put them as secondary keybinds on your keyboard, as long as you won't occupy keybinds already used by other spells with them.
---
It's the same in skeram. They think it's like 60/40
---
you can also right click the stealth icon in your buffs as it is a "buff"
---
Looks like you sold 2, which is 29.88g after 10% fee. The extra 1.07 ish is probably listing fees?
---
The incoming amount having listing fees refunded in it throws me off all the time.
---
If you bloodrage, then your healer probably panics at how fast you are losing health and overheals, causing the 'healer aggro' issue.
---
I'd try just pulling the mob, then sunder tab sunder, and revenge when it procs.
---
That‚Äôs because +5 weapon skill reduces misses by 3% on level 63 mobs. Hence why 6% is sufficient.
---
You think people are going to volunteer to move off their high population server to some backwater low pop server? Yeah it isn't going to happen.
---
The population of the game will slowly shrink over time and moving to a low pop is a guaranteed way to have a bad time. 
---
The problem here doesn't even seem to be player count, this server just keeps crashing. Nobody to blame but Blizz.
---
You apologists can just keep sucking away at the corporate cock
---
It's not an anomaly when the less popular faction is the most represented in the top guilds. That's a trend.
---
Digital heroin
---
What gear do you have?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The only one to blame is Blizzard for not opening enough servers at the correct time instead of waiting one week past the release date to do something. 
---
None of the other US launch servers are nearly this bad.
---
Faelina's problem is that its the streamer server. They could have lauched with 100 US servers and Faerlina's pop would be about the same.
---
My experience is the exact opposite.  The vast majority of the people are friendly and helpful.
---
As someone who came to WoW from DAoC my biggest gripe is that I can‚Äôt just plop down at a camp and grind for hours. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to run all over the zone navigating.

Jesus fucking christ lol. THE SERVERS ARE LOW POP BECAUSE STUBBORN IDIOTS AREN'T XFERING TO THEM. Holy shit.

Get trash blade in Mara then you can farm BRD for HoJ in between questing. Your BiS is 6/8 Shadowcraft and 2/2 devilsaur, so you can try to get groups at 58 for Strat, Scholo and UBRS but you can buy like 4 pieces of your gear off AH. DM Tribute runs you can buy the rings for like 30g each off a hunter if you don't feel like running em.
---
*world
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind :)
---
At least on my server (Shazzrah EU) the dominating faction of BRD is constantly changing. An Alliance raid blocked the entrance to it. But then we came through with my guild who wanted to go MC and another guild that also wanted to go MC. 
---
The most apparent one is the BRS entrance. There are always either Horde or Alliance in there. Sometimes you are lucky and get out and your faction is there. Or you die.
---
One time was funny. We got out, saw alliance and ran back in. The alliance also saw us and ran back in.
---
This is literally a thing fixed in Cata with zebra hooves and giraffe heads or whatever

I was killing a very specific type of gorilla in a damn monkey cave in a damn sweaty jungle pit last night and so was every other lvl 53-56 Alliance and Horde. I was going insane trying to tag a "Un'Goro GORILLA" and have it not drop 1 in over 20 kills. I later found I had that 1 specific pelt in my bank....
---
I'd find it unbearable.
---
Have people crowd control targets. 
---
You can have rogues sap, mages sheep, locks banish (sometimes), hunter trap, pally and Druid offtank.
---
If it takes longer than 12 seconds to kill, it's the highest damage to mana ratio single target spell hunters have at lower levels. Initiate with it. It only becomes a waste of mana once you hit high levels and your arcane shot starts to do insane crits. Even then, it's only outclassed IF the arcane shot crits. Exception is aimed shot, which has an insane mana cost but insane numbers regardless of whether it crits or not.
---
For someone with a warlock flair, you'd think you'd understand the value and mechanics of DoTs.
---
This is actually my biggest problem with leveling right now, I froze up at 39 about two weeks ago and lost motivation to play because im finally at a point where I never got to before and I have to sit there spending time trying to figure out what to do next for my quest when I want to just mindlessly kill things. I probably could just go and do that tbh but its not very efficient.
---
Why are you playing on a PvP server then? What did you expect of a PvP server? If you don't wanna fight battles in BRM then why not roll PvE?
---
I reported some schlub just the other day for saying this to me cross faction
---
"While it's true that some quest mobs are poorly designed, it's also true that other quest mobs are flawed in other, more innovative ways."
---
Blizzard doesn't care.
---
That's the thing. Even though 55:45 doesn't sound too bad, Horde will eventually overwhelm any contested area. Alliance need to coordinate a bit to get on even ground.
---
Hugely depending on your server's economy. Cost me &lt;100g on mine to hit 200. Also depends if you pick a good guide of course.
---
IKR? I hate that quest
---
Those dungeons are all 1.5 hours give/ take. (Complete strat would be 3h)
---
Sounds like you've changed which "page" your main action bar is. If you've got default UI, there should be some arrows to the right hand side of your main action bar, set that to page 1 (or shift-1 for the keybind). If you're using any shift+number it's likely paging to it there.
---
You're think playing the auction house is something new? People made thousands playing the AH in vanilla
---
I'm not gonna lie, this is the *fastest* way to drive new players away from a game.  It's not the player's job to worry about spawn repopulation, that's for the devs.  Yeah, this is the world you have to deal with right now, but it's a video game.  It should be better designed than this.
---
Without mods, you only have 6 action bars. You can rotate between them, but each number corresponds to an on screen action bar, if you add bars. Try changing the number next to you action bar, as it sounds like you aren't on action bar one
---
13% of wow players actually kill like over 50% of raid bosses, crazy
---
This happens in Feralas with the Ogres.
---
I can't remember exactly, but I believe it's.... Shamans? You need to kill all the other type of ogres to spawn shamans cause there's like 4-5 different types and in most locations any type can spawn and no one kills the other types and just murders the shamans until none are spawned.
---
Hey I'm looking to roll an alliance alt on a pvp server aswell. It would be nice to murder characters with actual character instead of slaughtering boring alliance races constantly.
---
You can only raid with that same group until Tuesday. Can‚Äôt do the bosses before Garr with another group
---
Auribuying would be a bot though
---
Yeah, demon warlock in retail is a really awesome spec.
---
I find that sometimes sequence breaks occur when spells with a cast time come before instant cast spells in a castsequence macro.
---
Ty for making a fool of yourself
---
But I'm looking for a server where horde is higher pop then alliance by at least 60 to 40
---
Ah this worked. Thanks man. I was getting so frustrated haha
---
You need three \\'s
---

I played wow on a touchpad for months, if you can spare $20, I‚Äôd just buy a mouse tho
---
Never had any issue getting people to group for quests on Whitemane myself. Probably just a timing thing.
---
Ah yes, I'm definitely the fool here. Fucking yikes, kid.
---
This happened to me when classic released. Hasn‚Äôt happened in awhile tho
---
Went back and re-read the comment,you're right.  I inserted a comma in my head after the "No"  I thought he initially said "No, rank 14 gear is BiS for the full game, so it's totally fine \[to lock it behind a borderline unreasonable grind\]"
---
A warrior's login screen.
---
No worries. You can unbind action bar paging in the keybinds. :)

Hi, I maintain a list of addon managers here:

Of those in the default list, addon managers that have search functionality are:

---
* "layday/instawow" https://github.com/layday/instawow
---
* "ogri-la/wowman" (me) https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman
---
I'll add 'search' and 'auto update' to the columns available I think.
---
Green wands have a max roll of +13
---
Yes you are the fool here. kid.
---
Is there such a thing as emberseer runs for the shoulders in UBRS?
---
Minion handles wowinterface.com, Twitch handles curseforge.com
---
Two different sets of addons with a large overlap as addon authors upload to both, however some addons are more regularly updated on one service over another.
---
Eh just because he wrote funky and his name is funky? That's not really that great.
---
I'm not sure this is right since I don't think they can stack in the AH.
---
Zzz please stop repeating whatever I say. Why is your brain so broken D:

Simply being in the channel doesn't imply gold buying, because then you would also be considered a good buyer by that same standard

---
I wouldn't stress it man, you gotta remember this place is heavily skewed towards the hardcore.
---
Our guild did it in 2 nights, but even then you can still easily mess things up. We did both Ony and MC in under 2 hours from invites to hearth one week, then the next we almost ran out of time on just a MC night because of several wipes. There's basically zero downtime in our raids, and we skip an incredible amount of trash. It's extremely stressful for a new raider like me. If we took it slow and steady, I could have seen us taking much longer for our first completion.
---
Our loot council is sometimes permanently in another discord channel because we are already at the next boss before they finish up in some cases.
---
What makes me laugh is in one night we had 2 people gquit because it was way too fast, and another guy quit because we were too slow. I guess that makes us semi-hardcore?
---
I chat to plenty of other raiders and they are shocked when I tell them our clear times - both because our gear isn't super great, but also because they are slower with their 100% fully geared guilds. Then you come on here and anything more than 45 minutes on MC you may as well be keyboard turners.
---
Good luck on your progress my man! Rag becomes fairly easy once you can dps him down before submerge, so it'll get better after a rough couple clears!
---
Not in class mechanics, but artifacts brought a lot of cool stuff that is now lost. For example, the affliction artifact golden trait Soul Flame. Dying mobs around you exploded in shadowflame damage. Epic aoe. They just removed it. A lot of classes lost stuff like this.
---
Thalnos offers transfers to netherwind. I hopped on as soon as possible. 
---
It might still be available
---
thursday is phase 2
---
You should put the weather forecast and a stock market ticker on that ui. There is still some unused space.
---
Dire maul east :)
---
I heard you could make one for mages too. It's called frostbolt
---
Got it on first drop, ty so much!
---
Snes
---
It's a mixed bag, depending on where you are and who you're with.
---
Many people have been very nice, in my experience, and honestly seem to enjoy when an opportunity to be kind and helpful to another player arises.
---
Like... I asked a simple question about weapon proficiencies and a guy hunted me down, gave me a gold piece, and encouraged me to get them all.
---
A few days later another player inspected me when I was fishing at level 13, handed me a bunch of mage food &amp; water, a 10 slot bag, and wished me well. 
---
Then in trade chat people were being silly and having fun and someone cussed them out and called them cunts because that's not what trade chat is for. 
---
/shrug
---
There always needs to be better stuff to attain in a new expansion or people won't feel the need to go complete it, and it'd feel pointless if everything was just side grades or even just minor upgrades, so the longer an MMO runs there will always be this problem. But the weird thing is Blizzard seemingly didn't even try to avoid it in any way, they just went up to an obscene level cap and went from +20 to a stat to +hundreds in a relatively short time, now finally culminating in their level squish plan to try to correct years after.
---
To be honest it would have been fine for the first zone in TBC to have some good items, but not so insanely overblown. I was one of those guys still holding my C'thun hammer in town like in disbelief the 61 greens were so good but being stubborn.
---
This problem existed in vanilla, and the game survived. What makes now any different? Roll PVP server, have PVP realities.
---
Switching your weapons like that puts all your abilities on global cooldown so the rest of the macro can't activate. However pummel doesn't require using a 2h so you can take the weapon swap out of that macro. As another commenter said though a castsequence macro will probably work better for what you're trying to do.
---
The internet never lies!  If someone on Reddit says yelling before a roll makes you roll better, then it must be true!  It must have been user error!
---
Yep it was hot fixed for some hot garbage reason
---
Hint: don't do the latter if you don't want to look like an idiot and actually be useful for kiting in groups.
---
I'm pretty sure that's not true.  Each individual creature has its own spawn point, and respawns separately and then patrols.  It's not like there's a big zone of bears and it spawns them when there are less.  There are 15 spawn points of type black bear.  The 5 that are dead and are waiting to respawn, the 10 that are alive are patrolling, etc.   If you look at some of the camps carefully you can see this at work.  If you kill only one type of mob, only that type will respawn.
---
16% with over 100k and nearly half with 10k+ there‚Äôs no way.

It is always worse threat, but with 25 agi it is significantly better mitigation.  25 agi is 1.25% dodge.

is there somewhere to find others weakauras code / import for priests?

Have a read about Asymmetrical Warfare. Here's a quick recap of all history: all wars involve both sides trying to get an advantage on the other, because all is fair in love and war.

**Asymmetric warfare**
---
Asymmetric warfare (or asymmetric engagement) is war between belligerents whose relative military power differs significantly, or whose strategy or tactics differ significantly. This is typically a war between a standing, professional army and an insurgency or resistance movement militias who often have status of unlawful combatants.
---
Asymmetric warfare can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and, in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality of their forces and equipment.

Plz kill 40-100 wolves for 5 worg hearts
---
This is what made me finally leave. I actually switched from a low pop to faerlina to make sure I always have groups but it's gotten ridiculous. I switched to Herod since it seems popular and gonna see how it goes
---
What faction do you want to play? Many are fairly balanced but if you roll the wrong faction you might sway it the wrong way.
---
Oh hey some bloated bear colon. Why didn't it count? Oh, they wanted *engorged* bear colons.
---
I skip harpy quests because their noises are so annoying.
---
oops forgot to add that. right now only alliance
---
Is there any other way to farm gold as a Warlock other than Mara/DM:E?
---
 Hydrospawn is way too inconsistent, sometimes he completely ignores the pillar and walks right through it (yes im doing the jumps correctly) 
---
And Maraudon Isn't that great gp/h if you dont have herb/mining
---
Bite spends 35 focus (10 second cooldown) and deals 90 damage.
---
Claw spends 25 focus (no cool down) and deals 51 damage.
---
If you are just using Bite you'll be generating \~46 focus per 10 seconds (two ticks) and spending 35. So yes, your pet will have unspent focus. The perk of Bite is that it is more efficient damage per focus.
---
Also if you're leveling as Beast, which you should be, claw equates to more attacks, more crits, and therefore more Frenzy procs.
---
I hit level 60 with close to 8 days played.
---
Seems worthless as I‚Äôd only be saying this to players in immediate proximity to me.
---
But... I thought Classic wasn't going to flop because it was all just rose-tinted glasses XD
---
now all you need is to clean up unit frames and bars and minimap.
---
So much this. As neat as 305 Weapon skill is, it will not make up for human error &amp; RNV. I'm a perfect world, yea, you will do more damage, but on paper, the better/luckier player will win out.
---
It hurts me to write this:  My warrior used a staff of jordan for a bit.
---
An undead rogue, how surprising.
---
Wow, spectacular cover! Insanely well done, gave me full on Frisson, only the best music can do that!
---
\~25 does not equal 25. Your pet gains 22-24 focus every 5 seconds. This is an important distinction. It means there will be one tick window where it only has enough focus to growl, and growls.
---
&gt; Yes, they are easy... but there are a lot of players out there that are just now reaching 60 and do not know how to play their class.
---
This exactly, all the good players are 60 already for a long time now and clearing the content with ease.
---
Everyone who hits 60 now is absolute trash at the game and those people are the ones spending 2 days, 4 hours each to kill like at least 5-6 bosses in MC.
---
I turned off clean minimal because it was bugging out one of my other add-ons, lol. What do you propose about the unit frames? I like the standard'ish blizzard frame style
---
Isn‚Äôt thunder fury unobtainable right now? Because you need the elementium  recipe from bwl?
---
Because you are playing against an unpredictable foe with intelligence. And the challenge in that coupled with the variety makes it 10 times more fun.
---
&gt; That an I am dying to make transmogrification runs through legion content.
---
DK NH Mythic.
---
Warlock ToS mythic. 
---
Paladin NH mythic.
---
I  heavily recommend getting the above. All are awesome.
---
LMAO
---
F
---
So you only need 4% from gear right? Since you get 5% from expertise with a PVE spec?
---
Yes the bis lists largely sacrifice flat stats. Master's items with no stats but +41 shadow damage get listed as "bis"
---
Those aren'tactually bis. They do a lot of damage bit they're not bis. You need int and Stam for the resources and incidental crit chance. 
---
That said if you're looking at something wondering if +3 int and +4 Stam is worth losing 11 spellpower, you'd choose the spellpower and less stats.
---
Is it not an option to take your gaming mouse with you and use it with the laptop ?
---
Yes, it's all absolutely normal.
---
Try all the things, and do more of what you enjoy.
---
You're almost at the level for the Deadmines, the first instanced dungeon for alliance players :) Remember to sheep the thing thats been marked with a moon :)
---
What add on are people using to find deals like this?
---
You mean 10 times more
---
If the class design is good I might play it. If it's shit like BfA I will get bored in 2 months again though.
---
You made heirlooms but in classic.
---
I got this from my druid asap when I saw it on the AH for 30g I dont know the "true" price of it but it looked like a mini warden staff and those are 500g so i think it'll be worth it
---
Nightblade rarely goes for more than 10g.
---
Legion was really good. By the end of Legion I was wishing for a Legion classic aswell lol.
---
I definitely recommend grobbulus for alliance. It's a great server but have a number of horde rerolling here and could use some fresh alliance.
---
What addons?
---
&gt;very single expansion in the history of WoW looked promising, and every single one has made the game worse. 
---
That's subjective. I loved Legion and do not think it made the game worse. The only expansions that I think made the game worse would be Wrath with LFD, Cata with LFR and MoP with talent tree revamp.
---
I would highly recommend figuring out how to install the addon Questie for at least a more guided questing experience.
---
I use tullaRange for that
---
Hahaha

Geezus christ Marie! They're minerals!

What does this macro have to do with tricking new players? This is great for veteran hunters trying to rep grind or level alts. I used a macro like this on pservers and it didn't make me a worse player, and I didn't have a functioning version of it on blizzards new macro system for classic launch and that didn't make me any better.
---
It‚Äôs a joke bro, look your add on even says disenchant instead of selling.
---
I unfortunately don't like any of the elvui, meh lol
---
Unless you going with Bestial wrath there‚Äôs no point in going into BM spec. Your pet will die in most fights very fast. That‚Äôs the first thing people will focus in group fights.
---
Don‚Äôt worry one bit about endgame until you‚Äôre 60, it doesn‚Äôt matter a hoot. It‚Äôs just why you do later, and frankly, it‚Äôs a thinner experience than leveling. You‚Äôll do the same 6 dungeons a million times and raid once a week.
---
As for levelling, keep following your nose, you can‚Äôt go wrong. If you want to try a dungeon, do that. If you‚Äôve got a bunch of quests in your log, knock em out. If all your quests are too hard, just grind some mobs or do a dungeon until you get a level and then do the quests).
---
There‚Äôs no hard and fast rules, just go with the flow.
---
You can spend some time on your professions, or help some people out with PVP, or grind mobs for stuff to sell on the AH. It‚Äôs all perfectly fine.
---
If there‚Äôs one thing I would say to a new player, as a seasoned player: you‚Äôre only new once, and the game is massive and discovering everything is cool. Enjoy it.
---
A whole bunch, anything catching your eye?
---
Looks like 3 leggos to me bois ;)
---
It‚Äôs like in outerworlds. The prize food is cystypig. Which you later find out is the cysts off the pigs.
---
Do you have a good guide for engineering leveling?
---
go to retail
---
My guilds raid leader tried getting a 2nd MC raid going for people's alts and others who wern't invited to the main raid... only about 15 people showed up (screw people who simply want an easy carry!) they pugged the rest and only downed the first boss almost the second.  It felt like people just simply did not know their class or even what to do, I hope next week goes better for them cause I'll be at work and can't help. :(
---
:(
---
What threat meter are u using?
---
Had a player like this in a pug Onyxia Cussing at his "buddies" in discord. So they muted him, he started spamming /yell with if you don't unmute me he'd pull Onyxia towards the raid. They didn't unmute. Group fell apart. Fun night....................
---
Recently did The Wildlife Suffers quest in wpl. That quest is the perfect example of this. The first part the diseased wolves share spawns with spiders, the second part with diseased bears also share spawns with spiders.
---
It's actually not necessarily *just* that. Blizzard went out of their way to actively sabotage gear from content that they deemed "obselete"
---
There's a bunch of items in classic that would have lasted well into TBC, Wrath, or even Cata had it just been a matter of stat inflation with no other changes to core mechanics.
---
Even despite that, there were still some T3 pieces that were BiS well into Kara/Magtheridon/Gruul, most notably the Dreadnaught 4pc bonus and IIRC the shoulders were better than the t4 shoulders because they had similar stats but also provided hit rating
---
In the case of HoJ it would have still been a good, solid item in BFA had the only thing been stat inflation.
---
But it wasn't just stat inflation. Blizzard made tons of changes over time, starting most significantly with patch 2.0, to ensure that gear and consumables became obsolete as soon as possible no matter what.
---
% Procs like HoJ were given diminishing returns on their proc rate that increased each character level  to give them a definite point where they would become outright, literally-not-figuratively useless.
---
Class Items like thistle tea were also given similar diminishing returns so that they would eventually do absolutely nothing.
---
Stats in general were given diminishing returns to ensure that as you leveled up you needed more and more of a stat to gain the same benefit out of it.
---
Where in vanilla a warrior always got 1% crit chance out of 20 agility, by level 200 that same agility would only be worth .0001% crit chance.
---
Earthfury‚Äôs pop is healthy.
---
It should, but it's not going to, as the add-on existed in classic and doesn't break any rules that makes it not allowed to exist.
---
I have about 11x more time played on my retail character and I have 23 days played on a classic. So imma echo, those are rooky numbers.
---
This happens a lot with the Tauren's quest in WPL. He asks you to kill Coyotes and Bears, who share respawn locations with Spiders. Since everyone kills the quest mobs and avoids the spiders, the spider population takes over as every respawn has a chance to be a spider.
---
You can farm essences of water or earth/air like a load of other people do. It's decent during off times. Killing satyrs in azshara or felwood, finding a good group and doing repeat strat living runs is great gold too if you're all geared.
---
So you want more Alliance to transfer off and exacerbate the issue?
---

Watch him use Arcane explosion until he's low on mana. When he sits and drinks, attack!

People and their shitty UI's lol
---
NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE
---
Pro wow tip, google prices for an idea of an average price and rarity etc, should give you an idea of what is valuable and what isn‚Äôt :)
---
That's assuming a pet's focus goes down to 0 focus and then gets to regen, which will never do because of the way their focus regen with a random value that is almost always over 25, and how their focus is spent irregularly with Claw being spammable for 25 focus and Growl being off the GCD and on its own cooldown.
---
Besides, it can regen up to 27 focus, as is listed as #13 on the [bug list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=992486865). You could also check with 2 minutes of testing that this "bug" is still happening currently, as I've done.
---
What tank would use a set for rogues or cat ferals?
---
this is why I quit classic after my 1 month launch sub ended, lol
---
&gt;If you give gear to your best players, they're going to do way more with that gear than your bottom dps player with garbage gear. 
---
First you seem to make some sick assumption that the player who has inferior gear has it because he is lacking in some skill.  Not having pre-raid BiS has no relation to skill whatsoever.  Why you seem to make this connection is beyond me and is a total goal post move.
---
The reality is that all things being equal in terms of pressing a button (if you're a mage) to pressing a few buttons (if you have good macros), then the biggest upgrade will ALWAYS benefit the raid more than giving you a piece of loot that has +2 str/agi/whatever on it to you because you're a habitual whiner.  That is a universal truth no matter how unpleasant you seem to find it.
---
Stonespine too, but horde, indeed I see a big difference in numbers, but I don't think it's accurate.
---
Wasn't their a time in early wow when the only two horde sided servers were illidan/area 52?
---
I got to rank 14 in a ¬£50 Argos "leather" office chair, which was by far the best chair I've ever owned. It's the only one I've ever fell asleep in.
---
I'm on Kromcrush so I'm fine :) I actually care about the health of Classic as a whole unlike the stubborn, selfish pricks on streamer servers. Dead servers are a loss for everyone. Enjoy your laggy, unplayable shitfest because Blizz won't upgrade your server since they want to force people to even out pops :D
---
What‚Äôs the best way to find a group for Test of Skulls?
---
That's really nothing to be ashamed of. Spirit is good for all classes (some more than others obviously), Intellect affects weapon skill, and the DPS and damage range better than nearly anything in this level range. Nightblade slightly higher DPS but a lower damage cap. Better used by a 39 twink enhancement shaman, but a warrior could do WAY worse regarding a good two hand weapon for that level range.
---
I have an Aeron at home and at the office. If I'm sitting at my desk for 8 hours and need to be productive, it's easily the best choice. If I just want to be comfortable and game, I actually prefer my maxnomic. Still supports me properly while being softer and having more recline. Super cheap Ikea/Staples chairs just turn me into a pile of sore mush.

For me it makes the world much less meaningful and you can just fly away if you see a player from the opposite faction. World pvp and the adventurous feeling bleeds because of flying mounts in my opinion
---
Nothing like waking up to a fresh bear genocide in the morning!
---
Our warriors can also roll on swords as long as they are the correct specc.
---
That... Sounds like it does not any meaningful difference whatsoever
---
I‚Äôm stuck with mostly SM right now and on my server it takes anywhere from 30-35 min to find a group so.... when I have to run it several times for a level it takes a while. Feels a lot more tedious than leveling my Druid did.
---
Meanwhile 6 Alliance are holding BRM on Stalagg atm.
---
Guild Wars 2 does that, you get letters  from NPCs after you help them, and IIRC you get exp from the letters
---
Don't forget when you hand the quest in, you have to go back and collect 10 gray bear pelts.
---
I can definitely see it. I also see it with the point that I currently have a lot of time. I take over a lot of responsibility in my guild and it feels like a mini job. It is however incredibly rewarding so I like to do it.
---
Maybe he's just RPing as a battle mage
---
I prefer the Rod, I just ended up buying it for 40g, there are always Hunters selling it.
---
whats better for a rogue, 5 agil or 14 ap?
---
5 agil gives: 5 ap, 0.3% crit, 0.5% dodge and some armor
---
You mean the Hunter?
---
Yup! Plus you never know when you might get a snazzy boe to sell.
---
I want the remaining alliance to move off and just not give horde the satisfaction of kills or ability to gain any honor at all. If that is exacerbating the issue then yes. I basically want them to become full on PVE servers for horde.
---
Really? I feel like half the time I come online I already have an invite or someone whispering me for a dungeon. And when I'm not doing it, I'm most of the time fishing.
---
Could it have been a horde player in costume?  What was the mount
---
Damn, even at lowest settings?
---
I don't think it's that people haven't made much gold, it's just that they're spending it. Look how many people have epic mounts.
---
That's 16% with 500-1000.
---
I ran 110 duo stealth runs as druid/rogue for it, good luck. I got mine last week.
---
*Laughs in Smolderweb* bitch we high pop and got the best of every world.  So funny to see peeps following the pack fall off the mountain with the leader.
---
I'll admit it is pretty lame when you are trying to sneak up on a group and they all instant target you like robots.
---
I just wish since they put in DM early that they would put in Arathi Basin in phase 2. 
---
I love to PvP but my guild is on a pve server with limited alliance to fight. Even with the honor system I probably won't see any pvp action until BG's get put in. 
---
And I'd rather it not be WSG since that will just be a pally/druid fest.
---
Low level gear, unless its a lv 19 BOE pvp blue which could be worth a couple hundred gold, you are just massively overreacting, i mean cmon either you run this dungeon a couple times again because why not its good xp per hour or you very likely get another item soon from a quest or the next dungeon which is better anyway.
---
Its not like boohoo he ninjad the baron mount or the legendary binding in MC, its an item you gonna trash in a couple levels anyway.
---
And its not like the hunter or warrior took it for the lols, the warlock can use it just as well and just because he was a little low level doesnt mean he spent time and effort like you as well to get to that boss so why would he have no right to try his chance to get it?
---
Get back down on the ground and be reasonable.
---
yeah that's another case where it's really game breaking
---
No they are not. They are awfully statted and everyone who thinks they are good at Level 60 is still stuck in 2006.
---
I tried it in th caves in silithus when mining when vanish and prep were on cd. Didnt drop aggro but i think pvp it works, though I 'm yet to try it.
---
I didn't have enough for my mount til 47, it was rather embarrassing.
---
If you PvP a lot, it's more that a luxury; it'll make it easier to escape ganks/run people down while ganking. It doesn't sound like you're interested in farming Black Lotus, so it doesn't matter much otherwise generally, although there are specific situations it might help.
---
The same way Hillsbrad farmers can live without skulls.
---
Wat?  Explain
---
Hey gotta live to win though
---
Just a tip. Female taurens don‚Äôt get stuck.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs my phone but it doesn‚Äôt look like the same color though they are similar enough I‚Äôd accept that.
---
Just a sec, flinging ice cube at friend, will report back with results.
---
Kekfila is a good name
---
\+100 HP is always king in Classic PvP. But +8 Healing is great if you want to do both PvP (as a healer) and PvE.
---
It's not, i've tried it several times now and it no longer functions as a vanish effect. really sad.
---
Isn't Asmond that one dumb cunt that just trolls all day?
---
&gt;well it‚Äôs part of the game so yeah.
---
So are the combat logs that Spy uses to detect people.
---
Is it worth putting points into Improved Blizzard/Frost Warding/Permafrost if you're not going to be doing significant amounts of AOE leveling? 
---
I was keen to AOE level but the spots are always to buys for it to be efficient, and even running a lot of SM (I'm 36) I rarely find groups that pull more than 3 so AOE isn't efficient. I wanna switch my talents so my single target is better, and I think I will stick with frost. But my concern with dropping those talents I listed is that there are still good uses for AOE outside of leveling with it - do you run into trouble in dungeons for example without those talents? Is it worth maybe putting one into Improved Blizzard so there's a chill in case you pull aggro?
---
Thoughts would be appreciated!
---
You done goofed, tho.
---
Found the warrior
---
Also true ... but blizzard didn't want cross faction communication.
---
I would say probably freezing band over something like warden staff. Freezing band usually sells for 500-700g while warden staff sells for 300.
---
Whats the name of that ui
---
T.T
---
Does this not account for oceanic servers/players?
---
pally misses nade, insta pops bubble for no reason, basically played like a fool because he thot he had that shit in the bag cause of his mace or somthing
---
Only difference is damage. Unless you re shitting gold (and even then there are better ways to spend it like faps lips resto pots or buying boe epics) then iron is the way to go. I mine thorium daily and i dont bother saving it for nades. Can do a couple hours of iron farming and make 100 nades or just buy the mats/nades themselves on AH for a fraction of the cost.
---
Its actually opposite. The alliance is where the competitive raiding is as they're the superior faction for raiding. (Paladins). This isnt a dig at horde or anything at all but yeah.
---
Sadly, the people who follow him are even more stupid. Big surprise there.
---
Get better.
---
I never really got that tho considering that the only way you can get plate like armour is through shadow form. The + 30 % to inner fire talent in disc doesn‚Äôt get close to the damage mitigation of shadow form
---
Is it really? Damn thats insane.
---
This is exactly why I've limited myself to 2 to 3 hours maybe 4 to 5 times a week. Just enjoying the process instead of racing to endgame to grind and be bored. 
---
That was the aspect of retail I liked least. I got to 439ilvl and ran the same shit over and over. For what? The 1 in a mil chance that I get that final push to 440? To grind island expos? World quests? It became a chore.
---
Hang on, do rock elepeopletals have sand for blood? Because I think I know how this started.
---
315 weapon skill does give you an extra 1% hit compared to 305 but I don't think the DM dagger is worth it.
---
I puged Ony last night and there was a warlock decked out in MC gear with fiery on his weapon
---
The secret lies in the character creation screen. You can either click on Warrior and cry for 40-60 levels or click on druid and have the time of your life.
---
In like a Min/Max look at it, it's not the best thing you could use. In a normal day to day look, it's iconic and worth getting if you and your guild are willing to invest the gold for the memes.
---
"You may have howled of me"
---
You sound like an asshole.
---
Well it all depends on what you do. Brd full run takes ages yes. But there are various ways to get to whatwber boss you need. I dont thibk there is any boss you would need more than 30-60 minutes to get to and kill.
---
LBRS can be done within ca. 1 hour quite easily. Scholo takes long yeah. UBRS you rarely do a full run. A full run takes like 1.5 hours.
---
Well pattern seems to repeat itself. Good, bad, good, bad..
---
BfA was bad. Personally I did enjoy WoD more than I did enjoy BfA. Shadowlands looks promising. So far they have bee just words but I have liked what they've said and many things seem to go to right direction (class identity, no more ap grind, titanforging hopefully gone?)
---
It's interesting that Grobbulus' all-time faction balance is very even at 51/49, but for the last two weeks it's 46.5/53.5.
---
My guess is that Horde players who are tired of being on heavily imbalanced servers are rerolling to Grobbulus and shifting its faction balance.
---
Great now YouTube knows I watched that video and is gonna think I'm into that sorta thing.
---
I‚Äôve got the quest... just need to find the time to do it. 12 hour work days are killer.
---
I absolutely agree vanilla is closer to sandbox than retail.  But I think TBC is close to sandbox than vanilla was.  In TBC you truly could play the game many different ways and progress your character(Raid, BG's, Arena, 5 mans), but in vanilla you could only raid or PvP an absolutely obscene amount(anything less than 12 hours a day would never earn you gear near the level of BWL).  
---
Vanilla was quite restricted.  Because character progression was so restricted some people chose to not progress their character and instead just farm reps, or farm for baron mounts, or whatever.  But that wasn't because the game was super sandboxy, but because there were so few ways of progressing that if those things weren't for you you would just do whatever you liked instead.  That option continued to exist through all of WoW of course, when you don't care about character progression in an MMO it pretty much immediately becomes more like a true sandbox MMO.  
---
I agree with you about PvP, but the reality is world PvP while being fun, did nothing for you from a character progression standpoint(once BG's existed), which is why it was far more rare than BG spamming.  
---
I absolutely love classic, I am not trying saying it is shit or anything like that.  I just feel like TBC was better in nearly every way, I would love it without flying mounts, but I think the benefits of the rest of TBC out weight the downside of flying.  I would argue the path to what we have now in retail started with the release of Crusaders Coliseum in Wrath, that was the beginning of the end.
---
DME jump runs with a warrior. One of you a herbalist, one of you a miner.
---
Sounds to me like you got invited to a charity run and got carried. Other people might not be this lucky, so don't create false hope.
---
In California though?
---
I thought it was about the quality of the drawing, not what part of the horse it is.
---
'Cause I agree wit'cha.
---
What's wrong with the balance on Gehennas? Horde dominant server?
---
Garbage.UI on twitch
---
Warrior! I‚Äôm sorry for not being specific
---
Think marking and having dps follow the marks properly is a major stree reliever for the tank
---
You chose to be on a shit server, even after blizzard warned you countless of times, you still chose to be on it! Now blizzard even gives you a FREE opportunity to help you out with your OWN mistake and instead of taking it, you bite their hand off and whine some more ?!
---
You have to download Spinx GatherMate2 Data (Classic)
---
 as a separate "addon". Then in game, you open up addons tab--&gt; gather mate --&gt; and somewhere you have import. Just select professions you have on a char and click import.
---
Horde racials are better for disorganized skirmish-oriented PvP, which can include BGs like Arathi Basin where small groups are pursuing different objectives, but typically is thought of as incidental world PvP. In organized PvP the advantages of having paladins as your support class outweigh the racials by a wide margin.
---
*wife
---
You can buy sappers off AH.
---
Tbh those who go After rank 14 don't have to choose between two if you know what I mean
---
Honestly if I was a rogue or a druid I would hate this addon with a passion.
---
However as a warrior player, I fucking love Spy addon.
---
What the fuck is this sorcery. Never heard of this please provide info.
---
I wouldn't use it over the alternatives.
---
Depends on how you say fuck you. I said it to guildmates a few times. It was during friendly banter. 
---
That said, yes I did run into unfriendly people or assholes. But that is just normal. I've ran into far more friendly and cool people.
---
I just went there and he doesnt have it. how come?
---
&gt; I don't think it's too much to ask for a server to work from a paid service provided by a multi billion dollar company in 2019.
---
Yep.  They all do.  Except like 2.  I honestly don't understand the complaint.
---
alright i figured it out. I happened to ge 5pc giantstalker and that was teh culprit.  It makes things much harder. Going back to 4 pc changed the AI back to normal
---
Better than supporting the US bombing civilians.
---
be grateful they let you into MC now... back in the day you were too fat to fit through the window to get into MC.
---
scatter shot at lvl 24 ? the kid is prob gonna go into bm doubt he‚Äôll have that available, second i couldn‚Äôt remember seeing as i haven‚Äôt played in a bit hence i put the disclaimer. 3 does he have feign death at level 24? common man that requires level 30. 
---
you‚Äôre an idiot for acting like he‚Äôs a level 60 hunter that‚Äôs respec‚Äôed from bm to pvp. Serpent shot would cancel his CC if he could get it off. but he can‚Äôt so it‚Äôs a good dot at his level. 
---
you‚Äôre literally a huntard. Read the context first.
---
Too bad he‚Äôs still a cow.
---
r/assholedesign
---
&gt; Those servers will be deader then dead in a month or two.
---
I don't get it.  Your original claim was that Faerlina will die.  Now you're saying all the other servers are going to die.  Are you trying to be Nostradamas?  Just throw out all possibilities, so you can take credit when 1 is inevitably correct?
---
Great name tho ;)
---
Z-Perl and Dominos
---
Oh look. People trying to make the server worse. Thank you sir /s
---
Im gonna be leveling Herbalism from 1-245, I have a 60% mount, how many minutes do you guys think Mithril Spurs + Riding Skill Enchant + Carrot would cut off the total time?
---
Such a vague term can cover many different areas. Since i do have some experience with backend mmo servers, I can tell you that magically increasing this type of performance isnt done overnight, as the current bottlenecks are due to how the systems are designed. You cant just magically fix that without reworking all of it.
---
RIP blazing longsword.
---
The distance is probably the same as the view distance, yeah.
---
As a Priest, I can target people that Spy tells me are around and Mind Vision them. Sure, they now know there's an enemy Priest around, but I'd rather know exactly where they are.
---
Did five runs the other night.  Two dropped.
---
Iron bars go for 10-20s a pop with heavy stone for 15-17 and solid for 17-20. Herbs such as wild steelblume go for 40s a pop. I have made my choice. Skinning is for the weak.
---
9%
---
Thats pretty good. Our SP does 200...Maybe he suck...
---
Thats good for you as an individual... but for the rest of us that want to get to the raiding, and not take forever trying to figure out cryptic quest or find random stuff that would take a long time of exploration. 
---
You cant tell someone the fun in minecraft is to labor to find diamonds in random caves vs strip mining, turning on creative mode, or installing an xray pack.
---
Yes... At least they follow a process, more than can be said about many of my coworkers...
---
Last week was the first week we actually had all the souses so maybe that‚Äôs part of it.
---
No Faerlina is dying as in physically. It cant handle the load.
---
Rip to the best sub to ever grace this site
---
Well then you are an idiot. 15 shit players will beat 10 good players every time.
---
Thanks so much for this post.  I was able to duo this all night tonight.  Still no trinket though.
---
Prot tank and resto/ele me were a bit less capable of killing things though.. so we came up with a bit of a different strat.  We killed all three of the invised spectres and then did two death runs with the warrior.   (this is on the side to the left of the tree boss, not the right side that people normally go to with the ramp up). 
---
There was a pack of three mobs that he would agro and run back toward the far wall.  I would run along the close wall into the corner of the back room, then res him.  Rince repeat on the next pack.  Res him again and then we would be able to pull the boss.  
---
So essentially, you can farm this boss by only killing three trash mobs in the entire dungeon. (and your warrior friend twice)
---
No.
---
You want to Alliance to transfer off these servers to other dead or imbalanced servers? Go play PvE.
---
Ran over 200 times for that and the Mail. Only seen HoJ once and lost the roll.
---
Yea, I agree classicwow is no place for serious poltical discussions unless it is about the claims and land distribution of hillsbrand foothills
---
Three abominations?!
---
Half the people think I'm saying the game is dying and not even looking at what I'm talking about then smuggly going "HA HAAAA" When no, its the server dying as in the hardware running it is dying. No brain smug shithead responses guess I should have expected that from reddit.
---
Tuesday is layer removal still though.
---
Why would you play on Faerlina in the first place unless you are some streamer fanboy?
---
"I couldn't think of how to respond so I downvoted and moved on"
---
I'm still here ;)
---
I have no queue issues. The issue I have is the server breaks. Lots of high full pop have the same queue issue but don't break / crash. Get that through your small brain.
---
70-30 Horde Dominant afaik. Really poor apparently.
---
While this is super awesome, and warriors do wreck shit, the first video was made with abusing a short lived bug. You can see at some times in the video that he hast death wish activated (21 fury talent) and uses mortal strike (31 arms talent) which shouldn't be possible.
---
My experience was basically. It is fast to grind while doing quests to level 15. After that it is best to quest and do some minor grinding here or there while you figure out your next step.  
---
Once I hit 40 things got rough and grinding dungeons and mobs would have saved me the time from hopping from questing zone to zone finding quests cause I had no idea what was efficient to quest. 50+ dungeons and grinding mobs is probably the best, but if you can squeeze quests in then do that, but I needed robe of the void mats and the demonic runes took me a long time to grind. Once you hit 56-58 if you have some nice guildies then you can just run scholo for some quick levels.
---
You‚Äôre an angry person... If you‚Äôve been beaten in a situation such as that, it was likely that you are indeed shit at the game, which is fine, just recognise it for what it is man.
---
Operant Conditioning
---
OBS, but you'll have to embrace the classic spirit and record at like 380p
---
Considering how low droprate ony weapons are i'd go for the viskag since you'll never know when you might see one again.
---
''It is sold by a special vendor at Ravenholt Manor (basement) in **limited** quantities.''
---
3.98% drop chane. I got it at my 11th run
---
you're jealous your server doesn't crash. lmao I must be too, pagle is great and no crashes. so jealous!
---
Some idiot down below arguing with me who obviously is on the horde. I tried to help some friends through BRD the other night, literally took them an hour to get inside the instance there was that many horde in the mountain. 
---
Same with trying to get into SM a month ago, it took longer than doing the actual instance. 
---
It‚Äôs going to be an absolute clusterfuck come thursday, every popular alliance flight path will just be getting spawn camped by the horde. Will probably be the same off the boat at theramore.
---
Exactly why my lock was never my main after WotLK. It didn't feel like my warlock anymore...
---
Isn't pets normalized already in classic? I know people wanted King Bangalash in the start because he was better and kept his name but that was normalized around 1.9 I think.
---
Not really that shield is a POS and has an absolutely atrocious proc-rate.
---
I'm defense you gave him plenty of reason to assume that you were worthy of it. More context would be nice but if you just kicked him for no reason besides a guild name you're a piece of shit
---
100%, the top guilds seem to be on alliance. Most of the big guilds are now getting their second or third team organised.
---
Imagine continuing defending someone saying an openly racial slur used to literally kill people in my country.
---
Try harder sweetie.
---
I always notice how people try to defend normal reason by writing "people do x, still crazy but possible"....
---
There are bots!, there is a shit ton of bots all over the place. The AH, farming Winterspring, Silithus etc. Every 3rd person you meet in Silithus is a bot, if not more
---
I'm fucking seething with jealousy. No queues. No lag. Still high pop and super active. FUUUCK.
---
Ah, okay. I thought you already had DB and were asking to make them work, because DB + Edgemaster +Cloudkeeper/Eldritch &gt; Krol + Devilsaur
---
Inner fire used to give attack power lol
---
What they said, Viskag off ony. I'd also strongly suggest Band of Accuria off rag, and obviously T2 helm/pants.
---
A good tip for addressing this now, and in the future - is looking at "BIS" lists for future content. Now, don't use these as a bible, but moreso as a point of reference. I bump it up to the next phase of raiding (in this case BWL) and I see what items persist. You can use Icy veins, [wowisclassic.com](https://wowisclassic.com) for points of reference. I also use [shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net) and list the armor. Although with [SP.net](https://SP.net), take it with a grain of salt... It depends on the hit you're going for above soft cap (if any) etc. but it's a nice tool to see how big of a stat upgrade an item is over another
---
Pets are not normalized
---
The book for +8 Int chant is too expensive, but I think the Intellect is the best for PvE. A lot of gear calculations rate a point of intellect with twice the value as a point of healing.
---
Yeah, the +100 HP is probably better for PvP, but I haven't researched that any.
---
&gt;common sense
---
Isn't so common anymore, unfortunately.
---
Why? The more you play the better rewards you get. Just like anything in life
---
Absolutely
---
Lmao I'm not your fuckpiece so don't call me that, and your experiences with the word are your own, I don't believe he was using it in a racial sense so you have no proper justification here, not like he's supporting a kkk rally or something
---
&gt; I want the remaining alliance to move off and just not give horde the satisfaction of kills or ability to gain any honor at all. If that is exacerbating the issue then yes. I basically want them to become full on PVE servers for horde.
---
Go back to retail and take this cancer with you.
---
What legs should i get if i have flameguard gauntlets but dont want to replace the devilsaur bonus yet?
---
Simply not true. Z√ºrich is the 2nd most expensive city in the world. The goverment is also disagreeing with you.
---
You are literally talking out of your ass.
---
love the tutorial - really on point - now could you just make that for warlock too!? tyvm sir :)
---
As a rule of thumb in vanilla and in classic when a BOE blue or purple everyone rolls need. Deep down everyone wants it and if you dont someone is gonna roll need and ninja it or they could just be used to needing them all the time. It's good to tell everyone to need boes when you get to higher level dungeons
---
'Kill these people because I want their clothes'
---
Are you sure we're the good guys?
---
Now this makes so much sense, oh my god! I wouldn't be surprised if it were true!
---
not gonna lie, most of UI addons just add new nameplates skin and thats it. Dont see the point
---
Imagine clawing at the walls of the grave your digging. Top kek. Please, keep entertaining us though.
---
The first was actually a warrior on ally side, though it is fun to pretend he never existed cause he is permbanned now and was a toxic player.
---
The insecurity is hilarious.
---
Duskwood has this with the Pygmy spiders. Super annoying.
---
spam it during prime time (7-8 pm server time) on Friday
---
perfect deviate scales and deviate scales.
---
Are you surprised?  
---
LOL
---
Furry cores
---
&gt;In defense you gave him plenty of reason to assume that you were worthy of it.
---
the epic gamer has logged in
---
Ahh k, I never payed much attention to layering since my server had it removed a few weeks ago.
---
^((I can see your disappointment))
---
Gl bro!
---
MVP comment right here.
---
Pet damage is normalized, not pet speed.
---
Yeah I know that our rl hasn‚Äôt seem to have found a consistent one
---
Arcanite reaper and heart seeker have an even higher ratio in favor of alliance than the ratio favoring horde on stalagg or Skeram. 
---
Not to mention that no ones really active on arcanite reaper of heart seeker. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre on here begging people to transfer. Because you transferred, it died, and now you regret it.
---
I used the dagger/off hand. But I would suggest rod if you‚Äôre rich and going to spend the money on a spellpower enchant. And save the offhand for later
---
Gl gl! We had shit loot this week
---
Hinterlands , or southshore area?
---
At the time, it was way better than any other MMO. This was effectively casual questing for babies compared to something like FF XI where you needed to form a group just to do anything. I think there were raid bosses in FF XI that took literal days to kill. So WoW was very refreshing from that standpoint compared to FF XI and Everquest.
---
That's 1 thing i wish had carried over from everquest: the enemies actually showed what they had equipped, and dropped it when killed
---
Well not true at all. E.g. Luci: If you dont dispell the fight will end in a wipe. Or if WLs fuck up banish on Garr.
---
Do you think having those t2 items are better than the full t1 set bonus for pvp?
---
Sure does! Yelled for a blessing from roll gods and got my t2 helm ;)
---
Have to try it out once the mageblade drops in mc.
---
assuming the streamer fans are younger I could guess how there is some assumption that all other servers have less population than the one they are on currently. albeit false, it's probably what they think. which makes ME think they are playing the game for the wrong reasons since multiple people including me are on different servers with no problem and with high populations... they choose to ignore that altogether.
---
"Let me play on an overpopulated server that Blizzard said will be laggy and then cry when it lags"
---
Those kinds of people do exist, but the reality is that it's a minority.  Most people want QoL changes to improve the overall player experience of the game. As the games industry evolves and improved systems are implemented into games, more and more people are exposed to higher quality systems that they find significantly improve their gaming experience.  It becomes a standard and players come to expect things like that.  What was once revolutionary for its time becomes outdated and unacceptable years later.
---
That doesn't mean that people can't enjoy it, clearly a number of people do.  It's just that a lot of people want the game's content without the frustration of things such as outdated questing or ancient user interfaces.  Most people don't even think about stuff like that when they think back on the gaming experience they had years ago.
---
That's where the "you guys think you know, but you don't" comment actually comes from.  People do know that they wanted classical WoW content to be the relevant content, they know they want that classic experience again.  But they don't quite remember it exactly as it was, they remember the content but not the frustrating parts that they didn't even realize were frustrating at the time because there weren't significantly better alternatives made yet.  They don't realize just how poorly a lot of the experience has held up over time compared to new stuff that has replaced it since.
---
And apparently only one in 5 bears has a pelt. :-D
---
I once saw someone advertising for a first boss only run of UBRS. They were looking for a healer.
---
meanwhile I stood in front of rag the first time again since vanilla - in a fkn tunic and greens - felt like a pawn in *rags*
---
Purple good
---
You're dumb. Stop posting. There's no justification.

If we're doin real talk. I agree. Thats why i talked to him after kicking. I've actually converted like 10x players from that guild by talking to them after kick. All of them were like "shit I didnt know" and I believe that. They just like some random popular guy online and dont realize its fucking our server balance - a server that was agreed upon all major wow streamers as off limits.
---
So when you get tools like this, who obviously know that, and just wanna troll its extra sad. Like you spent 30-40+ hrs leveling to 45 just to be a trolly tool? in mass general it detracts from the vibrate community that is Herod.
---
Yes, I had a 29 and the other one a 85:(
---
You some nice editing skills. But sometimes you overuse it. On the short big crit clips its fine but on the lenghty fights gives us some 1.0 speed moments aswell :)
---
Love your vids keep it up.
---
You just go ahead and assume that Blizzard arbitrarily assumed the size of the servers, without accounting for what their network infrastructure can handle. Surprise, since you guys hate sharding so much, the server has to be smaller in order to display hundreds of players at once, something their code wasn't even built for! The nuts and bolts are creaking on ever realm when subjugated that pressure. 
---
What you are complaining about is the same as crying why a music venue only sells x amount of tickets when there's *technically* room for more people on the dancefloor. It doesn't accommodate that many people. There needs to be room for breathing and moving.
---
Revenue =/= disposable income. They wouldn't be a successful company otherwise, same goes for private economy.
---
Is there any chance you could have the alt items pruned out if they haven't been seen on a character for a while? I don't like the random crappy non-spec-appropriate trinket I wore to my first raid showing up alongside the ones I have now.
---
His trick only works in 40 man raids
---
Lol you're an idiot. Playing on a pvp server is not "about choosing when you want to pvp"? The people "griefing" you at BRD are also "choosing" to pvp lol. That's what a pvp server is. Honestly just go to a pve server and stop whining
---
I'm not to sure what the most optimal PVP set is, you'd have to look it up. I guess it just depends if you wanna have your 2 pieces of T2 ready to go for next tier, or complete your T1 set as the next one is coming out.
---
Looks like someone's knockin' on heaven's door.
---
Saw it twice in 50+ runs. The first time on my second run and a huntard took it. Oh boy did I start to hate this huntard after realizing what the droprates are. I had also two epic drops in these 50 runs. Krol blade and a shitty worthless hp regen trinket. That's how rare it is. Advice: Run it with guildies and when pugging do not take hunters with you or at least ask them how they feel about HoJ and prepare for some drama. Only huntards of pure inbreed will want it, which were 2 out of 4 hunters in my case. I argued with the two and even after telling them about the UBRS and DM trinket which are 100% rewards and at least twice as good for them, they still insisted to roll on it. Make sure you get such players also on your guilds blacklist. I publicly stated what they said and when they started defending themselves they got roasted and probably went on some more ignore lists.
---
Well to blacklist a guild is an option, if the GM support toxic gameplay with other members of the guild.  Would it simply not be safer to simply blacklist the entire guild to avoid their toxicity?
---
as a shadow priest i love it cause i can just use it to target the player, mind vision, then attack/flee as needed
---
I‚Äôm like 120 arena runs in now and I‚Äôve only ever SEEN the boss once.

You wanna faction/server swap and come with me on some arena runs?

I only got the wrists and benediction yesterday, before that i have the pre-bis options. Only now I have 570 healing (I got like +100 healing with those 2 items)

Is this why population spikes are on Tuesday nights?

But what was the loot?!

25s and if the box has something good ill go back and throw in some extra g
---
I finished everything but still missed 11 buzzard parts... Yeah i collected 2 and then skipped the quest that required 10. Seems impossible.
---
I just did Scholo with an awesome group with no wipes and it took an hour. Most of the time it's more like 90 minutes. Both these times are for skipping Jandice boss, though. She might add about another 15 minutes.
---
That's fair. Ill take that. I'll admit Im salt cus the weeks leading up to release I followed those top /r/wowclassic posts to choose the right server to avoid streamers (we've seen the /2 chats on those servers) and Asmond just coming to our "safehaven" for 1 day to fuck us over made a lot of salty.
---
Nope the individual raid teams teams left and formed oh well, home, smoke it, secret nerd society and laser sharks.
---
Gehennas is near perfect, Alliance has the best guild in the world (Apes) but horde has more players and great guilds. It‚Äôs like 65% horde - 35% alliance. The balance is really good, you have apes, saladbakers and bizzno on alliance, dreamstate, grind, nihilum and other good guilds on horde. I don‚Äôt really know much about faerlina, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs really unbalanced skill-wise, horde players are way more skillful, that‚Äôs what I heard from streamers like venruki, ziqo, and those pvp hardcore players.
---
Comfort yourself that MC does not require great gear, dualwield is crap in PvP and once BWL comes out there is a whole array of new weapons releasing. Also DB has 8% and Vis'kag only 2% dropchance.
---
Therefore while it's sad, it's not the end of the world. Losing a BRE or Vis'kag would be more hurtful. You would wear BRE pretty much always outside the 3 hour raid content a week.
---
Viskag and Brutality Blade.
---
Ah so they are gamers!
---
He blowed 1 hour long CD, FAP, 2 thorium grenades and trinkets
---
Only thing mage had on him was goblin rocket helmet. Which I suppose paladin didn't have time to put on.
---
With lay on hands on CD paladin has no chance
---
Nochanges.
---
I did that quest and 2 other ppl arrived i grouped up with do we could share spawns. One asked where all the satyrs were? I said i murdered them all so that the ones i needed could spawn.
---
what he's basically saying is 'hey I pay 15 bucks a month to tell blizzard what to do,  they should listen to me because I'm the one that pays them. even though they developed the service I'm paying for. I should have the right to tell them how to change it.' which is absolutely absurd.
---
You're also massively toxic /shrug
---
God I loved that axe in vanilla. A friend bought it for me and I completely stopped leveling my character at 49 and just ran BGs. He came to my house and snuck onto my computer and leveled me to 50 so I would level to 60 to raid tank for him
---
doesn't even feel that bad, besides trying to farm certain spots. I guess PvE doesn't give much reason for the mass of horde 60s to bother going into most of the world, speaking from alliance perspective.
---
If they know that the server does not work anymore and crashes constantly, it was there obligation to LOCK the server, so nobody can make new characters. What's the point to overloard servers to such an extent that they are unable to maintain it?
---
The problem is Blizzard making free transfers away from server regardless of faction. Free transfers **away** from servers should be faction specific.
---
Also, they need to introduce paid transfers.
---
They're about even.
---
ITT: people not knowing mobs can share spawns.
---
Im missing GFPP looking at your buff bar.
---
Yeah that sounds like a load of BS. I purchased one of the less expensive ‚Äúgaming chairs‚Äù and I actually love it. It has held up for... I‚Äôd say 5 years so far? and is still in a perfect state after using is every single day for multiple hours.
---
15 is way too high.  It's worth around 12 for warlocks and we have ruin, it's gotta be less for mages.
---
I think Preach gaming said something about remembering the quests are a bonus the grind is intentional. After I read that, I just let go of the drop rates and spawn ratios and just killed everything.
---
This is NOT the case on Yojamba, only a handful of real competitive  raiding guilds on alliance, the main one being happy accidents with 2 raid teams, only 1 is logged, finale has 3 raid teams and only 1 is logged, so there's 120 raiders not logged just across 2 of the more seasoned alli raiding guilds, meanwhile most horde guild log their sub raid groups in addition to their main raid group
---
They do exacly the same dps... saying he crits more often is bullshit. Only difference is the attackspeed that interrupts casting in pvp against ppl without pvp talents.
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is shit posting but I totally believe this as truth.
---
So much cloth with agility.
---
Ah this brings back memories.
---
When I first started playing during vanilla I spent all my golds on a Phantom Blade for my Warlock then joined a BG and started hitting people with it for the "On hit"
---
It all really depends on the context in my opinion, I understand I may be the minority here with that opinion. I'm not racist nor do I condone racist behavior, as long as the word is not being used in that sense I see no issue.

I hit 300 days in 2006 before tbh release. Being unemployed was great.
---
Faerlina is the content creator server so it will be the most visible one, they'll have their events and drama for content which will also keep it very populated. Most of the new influencers that classic creates will also roll there to feed off the others. Without APES Gehennas is just like any other of the most populated PVP servers on EU except with extra bad faction balance.
---
They are about even for a warlock too, the staff edging slightly ahead.  But warlocks get blade of new moon in DMW, which makes mh+oh better than the staff. 
---
That said, as a warlock you also want the ability to use spellstone in pvp, so going for the MH is always a better option.
---
Crit's worth about 11.5 on my current itemization.

So read your spat below.  So your point is that the n word is ok to use, but you wont do that because you'll get in trouble o.O

Nuff said tbh

Are you my girlfriend? Beacuse "he's and ass, but I don't blame him" is pretty much sums up all my relationships haha.

It's not Asmons guild, It's McConnells guild

Still blows my mind. Even more so that games were objectively worse at the same experience, and the whole genre makes so much money. People are fucking weird.
---
How do you block channels???
---
Wow, you are my new hero.
---
pop bubble to get out of sheep. you have to go super aggressive against mage or otherwise you will just lose slowly
---
I leveled to 60 and cleared MC/ony as horde but rerolled alliance since the pvp balance on my server seemed pretty horde dominated and it didn't look like I would have much fun in world PvP. Got a friend to trade my gold crossfaction and started over with 1k gold and now I'm a level 40.
---
Probably a few more people who switched servers/factions to look for more balanced PvP like me as well.
---
id settle for wsg in phase 2 =(
---
tier gear is the current meta for pvp pally gear since its the only real way to get plate + all the desired stats.
---
Yeah, saving all my dkp on BRE.
---
Humans and Dwarves also have Desperate Prayer, a very efficient instant self-heal.
---
does ranged attack power affect wand damage?
---
Don't know... on my Server every 10-30mins my game just stops working. Chat is still working. People are still moving. But I can't cast a spell for 2-3mins. 
---
And then the game crashes....
---
I hate my life
---
You're also given the option to grind dungeons for XP
---
Heartseeker has 50 guilds clearing MC alliance side. The server is listed as high pop during peak hours . I have no idea what blizz is thinking opening transfers here again. Everything is overfarmed as is. I can't be alone at winterspring furbolgs at 3:00 or 4:00 am for crying out loud.
---
so stuff like crit chance\\run speed is just a bs? and the only differ between pets is attack speed and cosmetics?
---
in a real world matchup ret will never win. Only in duel because of area constriction but otherwise you can always reset fight and just out run until fap/freedom is off
---
Itd have been better to replace your gathering prof after your epic mount and gather more stuff with the increased speed to save for the profession you replaced it with
---
That's what I would do. Just be patient. After 30 second he will feel safe again. You can just sit at a random spot 50 meters away and wait for the time to strike. It is also no problem for rogues to wait for me to have a tough fight and I am low on HP :)
---
I actually am playing classic yes! :) 
---
I released 1 movie before classic release called ULTIMATE PAIN, and very recently another one, Feel The Pain CLASSIC, check it out if you like! :)

I also broadcast live PvP on twitch!

If you want to get technical your race is a slot you fill at character creation.  Yes it's a single choice with no ability to change, but it's still a slot you choose to fill.  There are also far better races for PvP and for pve, especially with certain classes.
---
The horror. Sexual roleplaying with people on the internet is far from the most perverted things.
---
52+51=103. you've got more levels than most!
---
A race change can easily fix that for you, buddy.
---
A greater arcane protection potion, resto pots, and free action potions are really helpful for a couple fights. It‚Äôs not necessary but it can keep you from dying. Every member that dies loses buffs which lowers tps/dps/hps which slows down the raid. If your tank dies once you just made the raid take significantly longer, even if you never wipe.
---
I recommend checking this if you liked my older videos :) , peace &lt;3

Than Zygor is the best braindead follow the arror addon to level.

Or do spellcleave /melee cleave runs in dungeons if you have the right clsss for it.

Them cheeks.

You can destroy your first mount and pretend it's your old one, but an upgraded version. Only works if the color scheme is similar.

I'd never kill Fluffy!

Your comments in this thread make you look like an absolute fool

Think of it as when you killed them, the mask was destroyed. This is how I had it explained to me once and it makes sense.

Ap if ur subtlety

And no one pulled the boss while we were in the middle of rezzing people. Definitely didn‚Äôt happen üòÇ
---
you mean the class for whom the item is intended?
---
also seeing it "a bunch of times" in 60 kills is lucky, it took me 49 kills for it to drop the only time.
---
So swords are way superior than daggers? Horde here
---
Man how do you have fomo about missing out on mid lvl quests and not be freaking out that your missing out on all the end game content.
---
Cant sugarcoat it.. thats all it is
---
Pretty sure that would have resulted in a myriad of various QQ and flame posts about who Blizzard try to protect streamers from fans or limit players' free choice, or something else equally stupid.
---
Do or do not, you're damned either way. If you are Blizzard, that is.
---
Yeah, I realised you could do way more damage using your wand and staff on k3.
---
Did you tell them how much gold you have?
---
Best PvP class? Debatable.
---
Great duelers? Yes.
---
Not yet, but Armory is a reasonable substitute while we wait.

What is this from 0:47 onwards then, paladin immune to like 5 slow/root attempts?

Gotta be one of them~?

Thanks for the tip, wanna try this tomorrow
---
It's a meme PvP weapon more than anything. Sure, it's good now. But when BWL rolls out, I'd take any 2h from there over HoR.
---
Attack speed is different, so BT only gives a minor advantage against casters in pvp due to cast pushback.
---
Dps is exactly the same, so is movement speed (normalized).
---
Way more Horde players, but Alliance has the guild APES which are very good players
---
I'm proud of having both mining and herb at same time. :D
---
Immune to fear. Learned the hard way
---
Yes
---
5g per stack of mithril bars is uhh...double that of firemaw which is already fucked up.
---
depends on what you like.
---
He has no problem with long queue times..
---
The server should work, regardless of queues, that's the reason we have it in the first place, to prevent "past login" overpopulation and crashes.
---
Bull Crates
---
What makes you say that?
---
Hell yea that's sick as fuck
---
Probably gonna make a Lock or spriest 29/39 Twink once BGs are out, love the dot playstyle
---
I might transfer to a more relaxed server now. 60 on faerlina too many people no lifers in this server
---
not "way"...daggers will still be able to top dps meters.
---
You could ask this question about any game...
---
It's actually not
---
Anyone got a one button warrior macro?
---
*because they have small legs*
---
Very little afk time, maybe a few hours in the first few days of release to prevent having to re-queue. 
---
Using /played and the number of days since release it was 3.26 hours a day exactly, so I'm not exaggerating either. I dunno what to say, I guess everyone else was more efficient. But it felt like I was constantly doing stuff and it was stressing me out that it still felt like I was going so slow
---
That's a 100% increase, pretty massive if you ask me
---
Not sure anything will get through to you given your rethorics and obviously set opinion, but I'll just provide a different side of the story. 
---
I'm not playing on Faerlina, or even US. Played on a previously medium/low pop realm on EU, and the realm has been subject to free realm transfers on multiple occasions - and this will be a shocker, but several big guilds have in fact transferred there, and having talked to a number of them, it's worked out absolutely fine. The realm is now medium/high rather than medium/low, and there's going to be (at least) one more round of free transfers now.
---
If you look at realms you can transfer to from free and don't choose one that's been verging on "high" for the past month, I think it'd be pretty safe for your guild to transfer if you all just agree on it and do it early on. I'm saying "relatively safe" and understand just well as you that in the end, it'd be a gamble, but if Faerlina (or some other very full realm, for that matter) is experiencing issues often, it's worth considering. If you move with your guild, you maintain your crew and your progress.
---
Also, Blizzard did not force anyone to roll on Faerlina - in fact, they tried to dissuade people from doing so after it started filling up, but many stubbornly ignored that and rolled there anyway. Yes, clearly, Blizzard are to blame for that. Much logic.
---
Fuck HoJ. I‚Äôve done 30+ UD runs for bone slicing hatchet. Haven‚Äôt seen it yet...
---
We tried to raid orgrimmar yesterday with 3 full  raid grps, the horde had around the same. Half the tams got disconnected, the others had 1min lag spikes. Great fun :D
---
What if you joined a PvP server because you actually  want PvP? I luckily play on a server where factions are very balanced, which makes the world alive and vibrant. I'd hate to join a PvP server without the opportunity to do actually PvP because my faction  lacks the players to do so.
---
Your particular level bracket being sparse hardly translates to the server's entire Horde population being dead. 
---
Most people are 50+ by now. I'd say most are actually 60 by now.
---
It is really.
---
Casual players (nothing wrong with that) that play WoW for casual content. 7 days played in retail means this guy has never even done any meaningful content in retail, yet is staying how much greater classic is.
---
You do realize lots of retail players play classic as well? It's not like you can't play both.  
---
Or do you seriously think that everyone who plays classic are ppl from private servers or those that stopped playing years ago due to modern wow being bad.
---
The absolute best is the Harpy killing in Stonetalon.
---
You need XYZ and K harpies. The field will be filled with Q-type harpies all day every day. If you find a suitable one, prepare for every mob in render distance to "randomly wander" to you instantly as you engage.
---
But it doesn't progress your character. Seems pretty pointless to me. If I wanted to play against other players I'd play a shooter like Overwatch or something, not a RPG.
---
It will not be solo'ed by any hunter. Any decent hunter will go for the DM and UBRS trinket and not waste his time here except for selling the run maybe. Huntards on the other hand would do that, but are too shitty to pull it off, anyway.
---
So it's balanced out skill-wise.
---
Ah well that makes sense actually.
---
Yeah and all of this is like 3 quests?
---
I fucking hated barrens
---
The people on this server really are the best!
---
Yeah but alliance has APES so it's kinda fair.
---
I play Night Elf, so that's for communicating with horde :)
---
Do you really manage to sell all those random shit greens? Who buys them?
---
It's like 10-15g on AH no big deal he's probably just using it for the shits and giggles because it's barely even worth posting it on the AH
---
Those that has made those kind of calculations do not know what the fuck they are talking about. For pve get +8 healing for PvP get 100 HP. This is the correct answer.
---
Heartseeker alliance are a bunch of yellow bellied stalaag defectors.
---
9d 12h
---
Im a resto dudu...i look like shit :(
---
Its always a 50/50. Either it drops, or it doesn't.
---
They're also mostly braindead.
---
There is no direct Westfall to Wetlands flight path. You'll need to get Stormwind or maybe even Ironforge flight paths as well before they'll connect.
---
Hey I also main a pally and alt a mage. This is so true it hurts! But at the same time glad I leveled the pally first
---
Because it‚Äôs a huge server with good faction balance, active wPvP and fun events?
---
Duel wield tanking and duel wield damage are very much standard go to's.
---
Glad you're enjoying it but it's not like a pariah build.
---
Not really.. Spy also detects if you get within range of a Hunters Track Humanoid.
---
It was on zandalar tribe right? Seems familiar.
---
I mean it‚Äôs so cheap I don‚Äôt bother selling it. It takes literally 12 or 13 stacks of thorium to equal the price of one arcane crystal and in the time you mine that much you‚Äôve mined 5  crystals. Rather just make grenades, I have plenty of money.
---
I understood dual wield tanking wasn‚Äôt viable until late in the leveling journey. But yes i hear you
---
This was me. I went on a family holiday the week I was pushing for Rank 14 and I literally cried.
---
That wolf is huge, is it Deathmaw?
---
I cursed people out over it. Wiped out dozens of spiders in WPL, came back for respawned wolves and a couple same facfion players were grouped up killing them and refused to invite me. Stealing the spawns that I worked hard to create and wouldn't even share quest credit for. Fuck scumbags like that.
---
Yeah it's a normal mob just 4-6 levels higher than the other pigs for some reason.
---
not everyone sits in spellcleave for their entire leveling experience.
---
I'd just use the fitting term depending on what it is. Like if I was doing heroin I'd say "I'm just gonna step out and do some substance abuse using heroin to destroy my body."
---
I'm not projecting or anything, I just like to explain exactly what I'm gonna do.
---
If I was gonna smoke hash, I'd say "I'm gonna go smoke some hash."
---
If I was gonna sniff cocaine, I'd say "I'm gonna sniff cocaine."
---
Just calling it what it is. Simple and easy. Probably also add a tagline that I'm doing it to destroy myself or attempting to escape reality instead of facing it. Because that'd be the only reason to do it.
---
It's kinda why I only drink non-alcoholic beer as well. Don't need the alcohol, I have fun without it. The beer tastes fucking terrific. Best of both worlds.
---
(Also, people can do what they want, bet I'll get a ton of angry replies about my insecurities and stuff, but frankly I don't care :) The ones who are truly insecure are the ones who call it something else than it is. It's part of why all these terms surfaced, like taking a dab or doing "a line".)
---
Or at least a price you are happy to sell it at.
---
But hey, people who don't set a bid price and rely on addons to do all the auction work like OP make for some hilariously easy profit, so I say let 'em carry on.
---
There is no ‚Äúspec‚Äù that would make swords going to orc warriors acceptable.
---
This is silly. If you cant spend 4h per week farming gold for a flask to pop in bwl you wont have time to raid bwl anyways most likely. Not that BWL requires flasking though.
---
I was thinking about 60 TBF, levelling you very well could be right, from what I know arms to tank is the go to there!
---
Engineering makes shaman pvp possible. Nice stuff.
---
No changes !
---
yeah, but honestly they can't cater to a small minority who can play less than 1h per day on average.
---
It is horde favoured, but not as heavily as depicted here. I do however feel there are more horde playing during weekends though, than during regular days. During weekdays it feels 50/50 or almost a bit alliance favoured (especially when I am out farming herb nodes). At least on alliance side there are plenty of onyxia/MC pugs going around with a bunch of serious guilds and there are no problem getting a group to do any dungeon. So that was why I find it a bit strange that I can't find a single player I have raided with in any of those onyxia/MC pugs, or any of those who spams world channel which I do know raid in top performing guilds.
---
Go for warrior or druid. Paladins can tank fine in many dungeons and several bosses, but they have the fatal flaw that they don't have a taunt. So if you lose agro it's game over. This means a lot of fights are impossible as the boss drops agro.
---
What UI is that? Looks smoth
---
What does this have to do with the fact that the spawnratio to playerbase is off?
---
Just ban all addons
---
Go tank or heal Sunken Temple or you can aoe grind the raptors in south east Un'goro.
---
There are also oozes in Felwood level 50-51 (not the cursed oozes which are 49-50!) but there's lots of Horde.
---
Exactly the same. One day while at work I just thought to myself "Wait, our IT security blew to smithereens with the system crash a few weeks ago... Maybe I can install software prior to them rolling it out again and bypass it?"
---
Made custom rules and shit and renamed folders. Game works.
---
I play a good 10-15 hours a week at work, it's very relaxing. As long as everything is done on time nobody cares.
---
5 people with over 100k, I'm going to assume that 4/5 don't have 100k liquid gold(rather 100k worth in items). It's possible to have I suppose, but it would equate to pretty much doing nothing in life except farming wow gold since release.
---
Chances are it _was_ in your log, maybe a buff/debuff faded, or they swapped equipment and one was added. Otherwise, someone else in the zone targeted or moused over them.
---
Oil fund sponsored respecc doesn't sound too bad to me.
---
thanks, that would make sense
---
Faerlina
---
And it's not (100%) blizzard's fault. It's the player's (in part).
---
Because yes the quest has an imbalanced ratio (happens often), so players want to kill the other mob more. But wanting to kill ONLY the other mob is the mistake, it triggers a natural selection, since most spawn points are shared between types of mobs in a zone.
---
Everyone is trying grey bear, and ignoring black bear because they have enough, but they under-estimate the power of grinding. Killing a black bear, even if you're already at 4/4, yields money, drops, experience AND after a couple times you're rounding the zone hunting for the grey ones, it WILL respawn as a grey one, 50/50
---
If you have to spend &gt;10 minutes on a quest-grinding zone like this, it's ALWAYS worth killing ALL the mobs and not just the ones you are missing, in the long run you win, save time, earn more XP, earn more money, drop more loot, and then you don't have those "quest droughts" people talk about.
---
You don't need engineering to equip a staff of jordan nor underworld bands.
---
I play 3h a day, I have 9d 12h play time, and yesterday I hit 54. I just play. I don't know, man. I don't have a lot of gold (100), I use Questie, and I'm a hunter. Sometimes I notice that I play some questing zones inefficiently. Other times I do something like Un'Goro and get 1 full level in 3-4 hours. Sometimes I chat with peeps. I've only done 3 dungeons in my entire leveling time. (Uldaman, Maraudon and ZF).

&gt;Unlike mages who have to do nothing for food/water,

Unpopular opinion, but mages also pay to learn how to create water/food and portals at mage/portal trainer.
---
Indeed you are!
---
1. It almost mandates ToS abuse.
---
2. It rewards time spent, win trading, premade pacts, etc. over actual PvP talent.
---
3. The amount of time required is basically guaranteed to be physically unhealthy for the player (not that Blizzard cares, but should we really be encouraging that in the community?).  
---
I could probably go on, but you proabably get the picture.
---
Top item is Leather of the Monkey, can sell fairly well because of how popular Rogues are while also being used by levelling Druids (as most are Feral) and Hunters.
---
The axe won't sell for that price unless that's it's "DE" price, a mostly useless weapon that is easily trumped by [Lord Alexander's Battle Axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13003/lord-alexanders-battle-axe) which is an item that's *always* on the AH and probably a similar price.
---
The rare axe will sell with some patience simply because it's blue.
---
The staff has the potential to sell because it's Int+Spirit, but it'd probably take a few tries and should be vendor fodder.
---
The shoulders will never sell unless that's it's DE price. 
---
So, nobody really, most are just throwing away a listing fee.
---
There's only a few hundred lotus available per week full stop.  No amount of farming raises that number.  On servers big enough to have 20+ raids, those get chewed through rather quickly.

Ahhhhh there it is, the source of the tears. Hey OP, spy can't warn the enemy player if you enter their range of detection stealthed. Try being sneaky.

I think its (obviously) pretty horde favored, but there are certainly times that alliance players hold areas hostage (as they should!)  So either I see more alliance than others do, or it's close to what I'd agree with- 40/60. Could be wrong, but I dont think it's near 1/5 at all.
---
please cry in this cup so I can drink your tears
---
I have no compassion for gankers and even less for rogues.
---
Hmm, not that fast. It usually only takes me 1 hour and 5 minutes to hit level 10.
---
Because the servers blizzard use are actual dog shit.
---
My experience is that Paladins are public enemy #1 purely because they are Alliance exclusive and can't do anything. Also forcing one to bubble hearth is immensely satisfying.
---
Why 7 str on gloves instead of agility?
---
If horde did transfer in number (which wont happen) and you ended up back to where we started with 65/35 etc ratio ... would that be a good thing?  Like there aren't any more alliance than there were to begin with on these servers they just all concentrated on one server.  If horde transfer to make all 3 servers balanced its going to go back to how it was originally with a horde advantage.
---
I wonder how much of a difference there will be in BWL/AQ trash for a warrior with Force Reactive Disk/Thorium Spike/Sapper charges will be vs a pally tank. Would be interesting to compare the threat gen. In MC most mobs either resist or are immune to fire damage and there is so few of them (basically just the imps) that having 2-3 warriors with AOE taunt up is enough.
---
The oversight is in the design of the doorway of the UC elevator, not the Tauren models being bigger.
---
There's nothing that a tank would want from Strat except for the gold. If you also want the gold, don't invite them and go back to LFG. It's like insisting that they come and take Gnomeregan for you for free... Your average tank at revered with Argent Dawn gets as much from Gnomeregan as they do Strat live, outside of the reserved orbs.  
---
Would you come and heal Gnomeregan for free if I asked you? Just for me to get exp and loot of course.  
---
Now, what if I offered you a reservation on a pretty likely 40g drop?  
---
Maybe this helps see why tanks are asking for reserves. You can either find a tank that needs the boots from Cannoneer (unlikely), force a guildy (kinda lame) or pay with the orb that drops (pretty much how everyone does it).
---
Actually got mine in a 4 men arena/anger/golem farm group, where everyone needed another BiS item. This is best practice and I wouldn't bother running for HoJ with loot competition. However when doing a full run without reserved items you can expect all the mentioned classes to roll on it.
---
It already got me killed on Onyxia last week when I expected to have ez phase 3 threat.
---
Anyone 'member when those wednesdays were the only days to show up for school since all the servers were down for half a day?
---
Imagine playing the easiest class to PvP with and still making threads that PvP is hard, typical rogue.
---
I am honest with you, if I would make 10.000$ a month (probably a lot more) I would play and act like a total idiot as well for entertainment and I wouldnt care so much about the game I play or if I only get carried from fans.
---
Lol well there's you're first problem
---
Is it a rock band?
---
I have the staff with +30 spell
---
Unbuffed i am 350 shadow power and 14% crit as a warlock
---
Well, if you can see them with track humanoids, where is the problem to also see them in spy? If you can see them, you can see them.
---
Blizzard: please consider not joining the full servers, you might experience bad queues.
---
also Blizzard: 2 eu-english pvp servers should be enough for name reservations and for the majority of big guilds to organize.
---
Yeah fk that... Thats absolutely 100% Blizzards fault, not ours for wanting to stay on the servers where we already reserved our names for us and friends.
---
&gt;Because every hit you miss is a crit
---
That makes no sense? Every hit you miss is \*potentially\* a crit, like I demonstrated before.
---
Do you play a PvE realm? If not then why? There is literally entire realms/communities built around people who don't enjoy wpvp
---
You don't receive any information from rogues in your range if they're stealthed. Likely it's just rogues that immediately stealth as they spot you, while you were looking another way.
---
I achieved rank 13 in vanilla. I spent all day and night doing WPVP because I preferred to play by myself and I rarely used a premade BG. Even if I didn't have a family/responsibilities now, I wouldn't attempt rank 14 because of the amount of dedication it takes makes you miserable in the end.
---
I'm very surprised  to hear that! Thank you for your input:)

---
oh the sweet taste lmao
---
Careful not to cut yourself with all that edge.
---
Respec to ret for solo questing or to holy for dungeon spamming. Prot paladin is broken beyond imagination in vanilla, sadly. The amount of gear to make it work is ridiculous and even then you barely hold aggro except in some aoe situatuons.
---
To be frank, my sub 30 lvl hunter's Spy addon flares up when Alliance is just flying above my head on a flightpath. I always run around with mining node detection, not Humanoid tracking. But still I know about EVERY alliance in my vicinity. So there must be something more that makes the addon detect players.
---
Thats confusing me, the picture and all videos suggest to use S&amp;D at 5 combo points?
---
Cool, good to know. Thanks.
---
Daww ty
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but above the 7days played on max level I see  200+ days played in total. 
---
Would that be 'enough' time to do something 'meaningful'?
---
I refuse to solo in the Charred Vale. I'll stick to the outskirts killing whatever spawns there until I can group up with at least one other player.
---
The mage  tried to poly when he was immune due to diminishing returns, and whiffs a cone of cold...
---
Every time someone cries about the addon more people will install it. It won‚Äôt get banned, because it does nothing that breaks the TOS.
---
It‚Äôs basically just a nonfunctional word. You could use anything that has no macro function. People just use null, because it‚Äôs short and has a meaning that‚Äôs close to why people use it in the first place. 
---
And why people use it in the first place is to allow the macro to start going to the next castsequence. If it wasn‚Äôt there it would just keep repeating the first sequence and never actually get to the second one. But now it will always only do the first sequence once, try to cast null which isn‚Äôt a thing and go to the next sequence.
---
When buying gear from hunters in DM tribute, why do I have to walk to the cache, can they not master loot it to me?
---
Hit the 500 with wotlk, i miss school.
---
Tracking should be fixed anyway... sometimes you can already see enemies rendered in the distance before they even appear on your minimap, how the f\*\*\* does it make sense that an enemy player can detect a hunter tracking for humanoids before the hunter can detect him?
---
I didnt play hunter in original vanilla so idk if thats "intended", but It should definitely be the other way around like on pservers where your tracking range covered pretty much the entire compass.
---
Lv 1 Prot here, don‚Äôt let anyone talk you out of it.  Sure its slow solo ... but you‚Äôre never alone, everyone loves a tank.
---
Every choice =/= understanding basic itemization
---
Dude, rogue are OP af in PvP and you still manage to cry about spy addon, imagine people having a chance in fighting a broken pvp class
---
The issue is that THEY Can see the HUNTER. Not the other way around. 
---
It completely removes the advantage of cat druid's and rogue's key ability, and one of hunter's useful ones.
---
Warning: do not open this website at work. i got emails from Corp. HQ about me infecting my work servers by "trying" to open this website.
---
also, it's blank for me.
---
&gt; as a warrior main, go pala , youre way better at aoe tanking 
---
I'd have to respectfully disagree with this.
---
Pala might have a slight edge when both are severely undergeared, and the discrepancies might not be as significant in p1/2. But later on, or at least when both are reasonably geared; I can't honestly think of a good reason why Pala would be a better AoE tank than Warrior.
---
Pala has consec and ret aura to generate aoe threat, that's it, the main benefit of AoE tanking with a Pala are those two; which can be gained just as easily with a Warrior via gear from Thorn effects; In addition, it's easier to get threat on demand and even sustained with Warrior than it is with Pally, mostly because Holy Shield + IRF just can't compete with Defensive Stance + Defiance + Demo, when it comes to AoE threat generation.
---
When it comes to threat generation, even if Warrior is better, Paladin might be able to raise enough that the difference doesn't even matter, but when it comes to survivability, it's a no contest. Warrior can hold more mobs than Paladin, and survive better and/or longer, by far, Warrior's not even in the same playing field.
---
I think Skarm made a more detailed video(s), regarding comparison between the two when it comes to AoE tanking months ago, think he might put a better argument than I did, but that's just my 2 cents.
---
Same they cant target you in stealth they just know you are there it creates fear in the unknown, the will they wont they where are they type of horror feel
---
Enable everything in combat log and see for yourself. When someone gets in range it lists all their buffs, including things like battle stance and thorium shield spike.
---
Shadow priests and hunters, most of the time, will exaggerated their "bis" to get whatever upgrade they can get.
---
Might be a good investment for P 5-6 when most guilds will require them, even on a low pop server
---
Any sort of aura a player is emitting will also trigger the combat log, which leaves quite a few options.
---
And I HATE them!!!
---
You cant
---
Only if the cast an ability. Just don't cast anything and you can still sneak up on another player undetected. 
---
Is it so hard to understand?
---
https://de.classic.wowhead.com/guides/shadow-priest-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow#phases-phase-2
---
Here you have the complete bis list
---
You can escape this downside with the help of some deviate fishes.
---
And remember that line of sight goes both ways... if you stand in such a place you could drop the disguise and break the enemy LOS without ever moving from the spot.
---
I mean, you still get the extra XP even with full bags. Anything is better than running around aimlessly for something that won't spawn until you kill more.
---
Edgy title with a well known exploit.
---
I hardly used anything except Multi-shot until I got Aimed Shot, then I used both of those. Serpent Sting feels like it just makes you go OOM while barely doing any damage.
---
i didn't understand the scam thingy here. it happened to me many times when i wanted to delete an item and accidently dragged it on someone so it looked like i'm trading with the guy. it looks like something like that
---
Your raid will probably perform better without the shadowpriest, so maybe he should be a bit more humble?
---
"must be in pristine conditions, so I can sew me a liver hat"
---
Not true. Auras, buffs and tracking can activate it. There's an incredible amount of things the addon can detect. 
---
As another user also commented, and I have witnessed myself, I have been warned of players flying overheard on gryphons: Who couldn't possibly be casting.
---
What kind of deal did you make with the devil to have gotten 42 Boe epic drops??????
---
Looks like you need to go to Strath.
---
The LFG tool still works though, its just now a chat scanner.

Not sure where he got T1 legs from

Gotta beat Dallas and one of them~?
---
True about having to clear mobs to allow the ones you need to spawn. But as someone L60, who forgot this mechanic, and who's sick of not being able to pick up the drops, there was plenty of motivation to go around the spider instead of through it.
---
Which websites am I looking for here? Googling isn't that easy if you don't know much about the topic.
---
That's a "load of BS"... They are NOT all manufactured equally. There are price differences for a reason.
---
As much as I‚Äôd love that there‚Äôs no way the actually do that cuz ‚Äúmuh no changes even if the current systems in place weren‚Äôt designed for 5x the amount of intended players‚Äù. I don‚Äôt get it a lot of these spawn timers were based on server pops of what 3k max and that definitely is just scuffed for the current servers. Lotus on my server have gone up 20g in the last week alone and people are really going to want these in later phases but shit even paying 300g (my own prediction of flask prices) a week for one is going to break people.
---
If he wants to Play shadowpriest, he has to step back in loot. Simply as it is, the same for Boomies, enhas and rets. Those specs are not needed and can easily be filled by someone else and they should know that.
---
If a shadow still wants item, hes best off with direct dmg increase items. Hit they get via Talent (they still Need some, better well theres enough on preraid bis) and crit is only partly usefull (Mindflay and Shadowword Pain cant  crit).
---
They dont do fire damage ...
---
I hit crtl 3 (stay) ctrl 1 (attack) and just click pet passive when need be. You don‚Äôt really need any macros for getting through it.

2.5g on ten storms as well..
---
just because you cant figure out how to beat them doesnt make them easy, keep practicing.
---
Hmmm... come to think of it, most of the classes I've seen flying above my head were paladins, so that could explain it. If it's more, it's a pala with something else - possibly they were grouped and flying somewhere to do some stuff together.
---
I'll keep an eye on it, see if anything else flares up as well.
---
Fuck batching.  Tierd of stopping a cast, taking 2 steps then being kicked... 
---
Or getting hamstring applied to myself from the the other side of the globe.   Its horribly done.
---
I was passing through there this weekend looking for thorium. Apparently someone in front of me pulled a mob and when it leashed it ran right at me so I had to kill it (was in a tunnel so not mounted). Boom, eye of shadow.
---
It's good at level 40.
---
This addon is just as bad as the LFG one. A rogue is supposed to have 90% chance to jump you in wpvp if he doesnt that boy is dead. If you use the spy addon you remove the sense of danger of your own game. Are you really that weak that you need this?? Sounds like disgusting weak Alliance talk.
---
Buy em all and sit on them.
---
not the one making qq threads, champ
---
But, but I kill them softly, like in that song...
---
i highly doubt the combat logs were meant to be read and scanned every moment youre out and about. stealth on the other hand was meant to, you know, hide you.
---
Then revert the mail System, reduce Player cap, Change various interactions, Change talents, revert gear Upgrades, reduce Interface Options ...
---
yeh sure #nochanges

Now I see a lot of discussion on viability. But what about gameplay. Which do you find more fun, engaging and versatile?
---
It looks ok, just remember you're going very deep in BM just for Intimidation.

I usually go something like this [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-52051030513051-032405051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-52051030513051-032405051)
---
This gives most of your CC a boost and 10%+ HP. Deterrence is a very good skill against rogues, not so much warriors if they specced into Improved Overpower. 
---
Looking back at your build it's very good for 1v1 situations, if you're dueling etc. But MM/Survival is more suited for longer fights with multiple fights.
---
When account sharing was a thing. I‚Äôd log on my friends characters, leave them completely red, with Rez sickness and no hearthstone in that chimney. 
---
Good times
---
I don't think is possible.
---
Dont you have to get the "ogre king" buff to be able to get the loot?
---
A rogue I was grouped up yesterday is much worse than you are... he kicked the Holy Light! *gasps*

Ye, that schist was dope

Im SOOO glad im EU.

Its possible to dodge the spy addon

I'm leveling a warrior. Currently 32. And already I'm having fun.
---
I was pally main healer back in cata &amp; panda. I can easily say paladin dps rotation SUCKS HARD (at least for me). I've hated in every daily quest I had to do in my paladin. Even if I had a dungeon-end retri gear.
---
yeah, *you can*. most people didnt and wouldnt have though.
---
Just like the current American economy!
---
Ward
---
Is this not a catch 22 for the Rogue? They will not enter stealth until they see a target but by then it's too late, they are in range for the add on to detect them?
---
I had Paranoia during the original WoW Vanilla. Which did exactly the same thing as Spy does today. It was absolutely a thing during vanilla and tbc.
---
I'll always advocate for prot paladins, playing with one myself. With improved thorns, he keeps aggro and does a lot of damage. 
---
Lack of taunt is indeed a problem, but with competent group of people it's easy to get the threat back.
---
I'm sure you did brother.
---
As a rogue main... Stopped reading right there.
---
Reread my post you originally replied to.  Did I say it was a nuke. No.  Did I say it wasn't ok, yes.   Frankly it says a lot about you that feel happier thinking you have caused others to feel worse.  Hopefully one day thing will be better for you and you can move past this.  Hugs sent x

How many people do you think had it in 2005? 0.0001% of the population? Fucking nobody had it.

If you know how it works you can sneak up on people. Just don't do anything that shows up in the combat log

**11/11 &lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual but serious raiding guild.     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1 (read our guild-info for some extra rules concerning availability). There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.   
---
We are mostly ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.     
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days are Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
Well that makes it extra special! Welldone sir.
---
Probably next time you will get him without sons. Have your classleaders check everyones rotation in the logs. Got us a major dps upgrade.
---
Agreed 100% really dumb addon that should be banned
---
Imagine being a caster and eating only when spy tells you to ü§´
---
Stealth further away....
---
Complete?  That's not even 2% of every addon made for Classic
---
They are on a server-wide blacklist, no one on Herod groups with them that know about &lt;Hades&gt;
---
I would not use it, it's expensive and inefficient. Use multi shot and make sure not to clip your autoshot. Thats more dps for less mana
---
This looks legit. Shadowpriest doesn‚Äôt really need a lot from early raids and can use most of their blue gear for a long time. Should tell him that or replace ur shadow with another class
---
From my experience, it is.
---
You're Alliance, I take it? Because Horde is much less populated.
---
Leaving without researching anything, over merely 2 hour queue, shiii you fucked up good.
---
Yeah but that's pretty normal, that's like getting upset that someone was ganked in STV.  On the daily RR and duskwood is camped by level 60s, it's just part of the game.
---
You mean to tell me Alliance got stomped when they are severely outnumbered and guards call 1 guard for each player in the enemy raid (rather than just 1... exactly 1, like they're supposed to), resulting in like 200 guards spawning in seconds?
---
No way... tell me more.
---
People just seem to think racials just make you auto-win so they go horde.
---
Then they go premade vs premade and realize that horde racials don't make up the difference between Paladins and Shamans.
---
Well yes - That was what I was saying, you don't need to cast an ability. 
---
Why is it more a problem now? Simply put, it's much more widely used now. It had the potential to be a problem, but wasn't really, hence no one was up in arms about it.
---
In expansions after Vanilla, WPVP was not really a thing either which is where this addon hurts the most.
---
Enter a contested territory where you plan to gank and enter stealth. Don't exit stealth until you jump someone or give up the hunt. It's that simple. Yes you move slower but if you're spec into subtlety like you should be for PvP, then you are only moving at about 90% speed, 97% if you have boot enchants. This is basically the same as being a lowbie without a mount.
---
Could people stop advertising for these websites? All they want is people to see the url and they dont care about what you mgs them.
---
Every day I see diffrent urls for goldselling websites on reddit.
---
You're a fucking asshole.
---
I like it.

Owl with screech and growl on auto cast is what youre looking for.

10/10 MC +Onyxia. [First Hand of Ragnaros wielders for Fairbanks Horde side.](https://i.imgur.com/qLJhyx8.png) 
---
**We are recruiting to fill out key spots in our 2 raid teams and to have a few members on reserve. So that people can take a week off if need be.**
---
**Who are we?**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you‚Äôll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We‚Äôre about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we‚Äôre not improving, then we‚Äôre not doing our job.
---
Our leadership team comes from a wide range of play styles. Both guild leaders are Eve online veterans holding leadership positions in large alliances, as well as being seasoned top tier raiders in nearly every expansion in WoW. One of our most notable highlights is being members of a world first Star Wars the Old Republic raid team. We're here to expand upon that experience and pass it along to other players.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
First and foremost ...we‚Äôre a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We‚Äôre not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren‚Äôt for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre new to classic, as long as you‚Äôve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
 We begin forming at 8pm server time. 
---
Tuesday, Wednesday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday and Thursday(Optional cleanup AKA ‚ÄúThe Chungus Raid‚Äù) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 4 patch.Onyxia is done the next closest raid day after reset.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don‚Äôt need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you‚Äôll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we‚Äôve done this before‚Ä¶ Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We use EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each raid to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:**Resto Shaman++, Feral Druid(OT and DPS combo), Tanks(Ability to run fury prot++)

thats why food needs to be removed, ruins muh class fantasyTM
---
It sounds like he doesn't even know. Or being very generous doesn't understand what bis means. Very generally, you want to gear them similar to a warlock, but with lower priority on any hit or crit gear. Any shared gear that's better for a healer should always be healer priority. Just like you wouldn't give bis tank gear to a dps warrior. Mana is an issue for shadow priests but again, healers should have a higher priority on gear than for a mid tier dps. 
---
They need to get used to getting scraps at the start of new content because you don't want to be dealing with loot whore drama when you get into aq.
---
Probably less than today. 
---
You have to accept that classic isn't vanilla and will never be vanilla. Back in the day, nobody had a stable internet connection, either. Do you want everybody to play with 56k again? Or do you want everybody to play on 800x600 monitors?
---
Rogues can be good if you focus on assisting others instead of solo plays.
---
These posts are weird.
---
Yeah plus, they start panicking even if you‚Äôre only farming mobs 50 yards from there.
---
Personally I use it for the kos list
---
I enjoy wpvp.
---
I don't enjoy cowards ganking low level toons. That's not pvp.
---
I enjoy boxing, I wouldn't enjoy Mike Tyson beating a 10 year old to a bloody pulp. I would enjoy it even less if Mike Tyson jumped that 10 year old from the shadows of a dark alley.
---
Honorable wpvp is awesome. Gankers aren't honorable.
---
No, i'd rather they just ban 99% of addons.
---
right, you're the one crying in a qq thread. get good bud
---
but PvP is more fun \^\^
---
Fair enough. I'm not denying that. 
---
However, we have to accept that classic isn't (and will never be) vanilla. I'm using ElvUI, with proper healcomm. That was unprecedented during vanilla. 
---
Times have changed.
---
Fire mage is fine up until MC, in fact it's higher DPS than frost.
---
never found that god damned quest
---
genocide simulators are so much fun
---
You're wrong. Stop spreading bullshit.
---
I said the same thing but got downvoted, because it only scans the combat log. Thing is, it also scans things not visible in the in-game combat log, like buffs etc. So unless you're completely unbuffed, don't cast any spells &amp; don't perform any actions, you can't fly under the radar.
---
Hunter gameplay is mostly preparation before fights. Exp. trap, flare on healer or yourself, drain enemy healers. Also good class for wsg report, tracking and defend.
---
Mages are alot easier because you have tools to react any situation. Just good position, sheep cc, and u can survive anything that if you have mana
---
Wasted half an hour in Hinterlands killing the wrong Owlbeast, because the two have the same exact model, and I wasn't paying attention to the kill counter on the quest tracker
---
OK? and now most people do. Guess what, people are better at the game now.
---
me (fury warrior) and m very recently dinged 60 alt priest friend was able to take down hydrospawn by ourselves. Which simplifies the task!
---
Now you just gotta get a warrior and a healer to help you! no need to look for those hard to find dps'ers
---
I'm playing without Spy and with a combat log window open. It's quite simple, everybody that comes in range with a buff on them - any buff - is instantly detected. Which means that they didn't do anything but come into the combat log range and I'm able to know their name, buffs and thus deduct their class.
---
I spit on that spy addon, that's like on the border to cheating. For real. I really hope Blizzard fix that.
---
Feels just like 2005, when people tried to convince me that my "addons" (usually called "mods" during vanilla), were considered cheating. 
---
Good times.

Southwind Breeze was **founded June 2019**, born from the hype for World of Warcraft Classic - we could not contain our excitement anymore! Our name was inscribed in the list of chartered guilds, and our site and Discord were launched. We‚Äôve been searching back through the archives to bring together a team of primarily great friends and quality players. Our roster includes many Classic Veterans, as well as more recent arrivals to the World of Warcraft universe.¬†
---
Our people are our biggest asset - Southwind Breeze is an inclusive community which was born from multiple friendship groups coming together, to form new bonds. We have a wealth of experience, from realm first raiders to arena grandmasters. We understand that you have a job, a family, other passions - and that‚Äôs why our schedule and attendance rules will not interfere with your life outside of World of Warcraft.¬†
---
We want to continue to build a community that can enjoy the game without the constraints of a traditional hardcore guild. With this in mind, we aim to be a **casual guild with hardcore results.** By keeping the quality of player high, we are a home for all those who want to experience and succeed at Classic World of Warcraft on a real life timetable.¬†
---
We are primarily **UK based**, and our founding members were groups of friends from Liverpool and Newcastle. To this day, we have over 90 members from the UK, and a handful more from Europe, and this number is ever growing. That being said, we extend our membership to all players from the EU. All are welcome to apply and we encourage you to bring your friends.

**Recruitment Approach**
---
When it comes to recruiting new members, we‚Äôre first and foremost looking for people with the vibe to fit in to our social community. Preserving our social vibe is more important to us than your server fist kills or vanilla experience. We‚Äôre happy to accept almost anyone who understands and embraces this, and who wants to contribute towards a guild and community that spans further than just World of Warcraft. You‚Äôll need a discord account progress your application, as we use this for all communication and organising.

If your class is closed we still welcome any and all applicants who want to join us for our community and off days, which will include great raiding, PVP and other events. Given that we value attendance, preparation, commitment and skill, there are always opportunities to progress from a more casual position to a raiding position and our door is always open to socials.
---
**Loot Distribution**
---
The loot system that we're running is a version of DKP called EPGP. EPGP matches our values very well, providing a fair and balanced system for both the hard-core and the less hard-core. There are no crazy bidding wars as items will have a set DKP value determined by stats. The person with the highest DKP wins the item and pays the value of the item. On top of EPGP, we will run a very simple Core raider prio list. This list will only include very few selected items, ensuring that they they stay in the hands of the active and committed.

Too apply, visit the website listed above or if you require more information, add Xido#1269 on discord and I'll get back to you.

No im not, I've done this myself.

If crying is poking fun at literally easiest wpvp class players that can stun for 30secs, when barely anyone has stun clears and then having the nerve and audacity to go on reddit to cry how their life in wpvp is ruined cause of a combatlog scanning addon, then yeah. Im bawling my eyes out over here, friend.
---
Im Alliance, but it should be neutral.
---
Harpies with Sam's screaming would actualy be great and hilarious.
---
Add to that: People in 2005 were absolute garbage trash players, many with **ABSOLUTE ZERO** previous experience in a cooperative online video game, playing on 17 inch square monitors, with dialup connection or at best an unstable DSL-line, pentium CPU and 10fps.
---
Naa fuck rogues and fuck stealth. It's a plague in any and all games.
---
The only people that likes that style are abusive and likes the broken advantage.
---
Got the gland on the first mob yesterday, think I used up my karma for the month
---
You don't need flash heal to keep people topped up. Flash heal is for emergency healing to keep people from dying. Which you don't need if you apply some skill to your healing.
---
If you can do the encounter spamming flash heals, that means you're being carried by the dps. It doesn't mean you're an ace healer.
---
Aye that's definitely true. 
---
Also, it seems like due to the nature of spy addon it can't really be removed. 
---
I guess my main point is that of all the addons that are different today, Spy seems like the one that goes most against the character of classic. Due to the impact it has, I can also see why some people are very up in arms about it. 
---
Personally, I almost never WPVP anyway, and it wont really affect me as a hunter in BGs.
---
My server has 30 for sale anywhere from 45-52g, would it be that safe of an investment?
---
I think it's kind of nice that classic made some people realize that retail is not the devil that many people make it up to be. It is a different type of MMO, but it is still a good game.
---
Go back to retail then if the games to hard. This addon screams retail problems all over.
---
Best revenge was a warlock in felwood that finished my wife and I while we were struggling with 5 mobs (3 were from him but somehow, we gained aggro back on them). He spread his dots and watch us die while we were technically saving his life.
---
We rested and searched for him but of course he was long gone.
---
Around 10 days later, we both cross roads, both 60. Got my warning popped up on my screen while in winterspring, farming the timbermaw reputation. 
---
I recognized the name and my heart skipped a beat. The hunt was opened. 
---
Of course, I waited for him to life tap to Ravage the shit out of him and finished this sucker down.
---
Quite relieved of the vengeful behavior (... ok not that much about the teabagging...). I would have missed him without spy.
---
Yep. I recognized one of the names - Sulemon &lt;General Chat&gt;
---
Its random which one spawns. Because no one kills the ones that are not required for the quest they quickly become the only mob.
---
Undead Warrior.
---
I did this myself, learned Engi, got 240 as gnomish, made all BoP items. Then went to Tanaris, clicked the book and then I was goblin. 
---
I've told my guildies and friends about it and they have done the same.
---
&gt;Oh simple just don't use buffs. u/AccomplishedCoffee probably
---
I‚Äôve heard that Gehenna has better pvp opportunity , despite either server population .
---
I‚Äôve heard Faerlina players do not engage in world pvp or organized pvp nearly as much as Gehennas
---
I'm glad, I think I erased it twice before making it:)
---
Alway been a fan orc, my first D&amp;D character back in 2e was a big dumb orc fighter. My first army in WH:FB and WH:40K where Orc/Orks. I played the orcs back in Wc1-3. So, I rolled an Orc sham during Vanilla WoW.
---
Not an npc, its a little book on a table.
---
&gt;You don't need flash heal to keep people topped up
---
I mean if you dont want to be in the "useless healer" spot where you do nothing but overhealing then I guess you're right. 
---
&gt;that means you're being carried by the dps. It doesn't mean you're an ace healer.
---
I mean yea that's what I said. DPS are killing the boss so fast that there's nothing to do but spam flash heal. Fights are over so fast that it's not smart to use heal or greater heal outside strictly tank healing since you don't actually need to conserve mana
---
Regarding Warrior talents, do the one-handed Arms specialisations stack with the Fury dual specialisation? For example, does Axe Specialization stack with Dual Wield Specialization? I‚Äôm not suggesting it‚Äôs wise to apply one‚Äôs talents this way, but I am wondering if it‚Äôs possible.
---
nice! :) thank you for your hard work. your site is great!
---
Means feign death is useless for hiding.
---
On retail they are just worth some silver
---
Its really helpful. That beep has saved me numerous times when leveling. And kill on sight is nice cause if that kid ganks you can add and when you come back on your main it beeps like you found treasure when he's in the area
---
They'll have to. The theoretical maximum lotuses gathered in a week for the entire server (both factions) is around 700. Most decently populated servers will easily have 20+ raids across both factions, which will quickly drain all lotus reserves with no ways to gather more.
---
I think some pservers had instances lotus spawns, which helped mitigate the issue, but I've never played on one so don't know firsthand.
---
item of topic in comment section: Buthurt casual retail pleb tourists getting their asses handed to them in classic, be it by **HARD** mobs or **RUFF world pvp**
---
Why do you get a tracking ability as a priest and i don't get a heal as a hunter?
---
There were addons like this in vanilla, so I don't think it should be changed. And all it does is collect information that is already available to the player and present it in a different way, which is EXACTLY what addons are meant for.
---
If they go down this road and remove it because of babyraging rogues, they'd have to remove so many more addons like kick tracker, DR trackers, buff trackers (e.g. to dispel Innervate) as they all read the combat log and alert the player that something happened (e.g. target got innervated by a druid, please spam dispel).
---
All these kind of addons were available during vanilla. Please don't try to force changes to our game just because it benefits your class.
---
Absolutely. Not that it matters though Pagle is PvE. No one is ruining anyones playtime by camping flight masters or killing NPCs in low level towns here.
---
Its just raw lag due to the high pop, layers, and upcoming queues on Tuesday.
---
That's not casual. If your hitting 60 in less than 8 days you def tried
---
spell alerter has been around for aeons, it's nothing new  
---
as long as your dinky rogue has a combat log entry for gaining stealth, anyone with half a brain will set up a combat log parser and give them the chirp-chirp
---
Grays on your kill!!!
---
I didn't know about this addon, downloading it now cause rogues are dickheads
---
https://classicwowauctions.com
---
That website only works for US servers i think. For me on EU, I basically looked through wowhead, checked AH and googled the item and maybe look at some brief history of drop rate/usefulness to determine a price.
---
Ps auctioneer scan tool is great to keep an average price for stuff
---
Good place to level from 47? I've done most of STV and just started doing quests in Tanaris, but most quests seem to be a few levels higher now or elite.
---
Lfg was banned for being an anti-classic addon. Spy could get the same treatment.
---
Sir, I need your Health / Combo point / Energy WeakAura please !
---
Faerlina probably has 10x more active players than your server, with only twice the layers.
---
S O N I C B O O M!
---
You'd have to take away sending anything to the combat log. That would break details, warcraftlogs, etc for everyone since the not consenting players won't appear in it. 
---
That's certainly a possible solution, albeit one I'd hate to see.
---
Alliance shall die!
---
Thats rouges in vanilla. If you find the game too hard go back to retail. This addon is the core of how classic became retail.
---
&gt; This addon is a cancer, and everyone knows it.
---
I think most people feel like rogues are cancer and this addon makes them more bearable.
---
So #nochanges is hot garbage now?
---
Wait, you are actually not using Questie?? Wtf? How do people know where to go without Questie? ü§£
---
Hold on a second how the hell does alliance want to run ragefire chasm? I think you meant razorfen kraul or downs üòÄ
---
What area do these spawn?
---
Lfg didnt break tos and still got banned in classic
---
Right, but you lost the context of the comment thread: Healers are using their flash heal tactics when being carried by dps as "This is the correct strat for healing" and start preaching it to others under any circumstance. Which breeds bad healers.
---
&gt; well it‚Äôs part of the game so yeah
---
And so are addons that read the combat log and present it in a different way. They have always existed. Please don't try to force change just because it benefits your class.
---
I came to this realization a while ago and started just heavily investing in lotuses. The people selling their lotuses now thinking they're getting rich are gonna regret it really badly down the road.
---
Thats the game though. Suck it up or go play retail. This addon straight up circumvents a core classic value.
---
&gt;~~This addon is a~~ Rogues are cancer, and everyone knows it.
---
FTFY
---
Also bandages. They benefit other classes more than my class, so I want it removed.
---
And unit frames. It allows healers to heal their party more easily and see my debuffs. Please remove these kind of addons, they're game breaking and will absolute ruin phase 2 and every phase thereafter.
---
/s
---
Rank 4 heal is too high 3/2 is more than enaugh. With that much +healing you should hit 980-1k+ with rank 2. Rank 3 renew isn't particularly useful, unless the rest of your healers ignore the raid. In my raids things get snipped pretty quick so its useless. Flash ranks depends on the fight. Shazz u max rank for example.
---
Need to roll a pally now
---
Underrated comment, and the root of the problem.
---
When dose BG's come out? I thought now just the honor system has its release
---
Sure, there's a minimal effort in hitting your macro button, but it's trivial to target the player once Spy has them.
---
Well then you'll have to disable every addon that came about post 2007.
---
For the record I agree with you, I'm just parodying the lunatic cultists of #nochanges
---
Remind Me! 7 hours
---
You used what‚Äôs the best weapon for your class for about 10 levels? Horror.
---
I don't know how people feel excited buying things with other's money.
---
I was super excited buying my epic mount, but I've farmed every single copper out of that 900 gold.
---
I wake up at 5 am every day to play for 2 and a half hours a day before I get the kid off to school, and all I'm looking for is like a little closer to December.
---
Imagine if they increased the spawn rate just as they dropped honor. Those zones would become absolute meat grinders.
---
rewards?
---
shadowmaw panthers vs strangthorn tigresses
---
Would like to know too pls saving this post
---
You managed to fuck up the only rule in MC. Don't stand in fire.
---
Wow thank you :-)
---
And when they increase the spawn rate you will lose all your investments? Its a risky strategy
---
Ok im convinced, switching from horde
---
omokks and stack hit elsewear.... Fuck trying to get that thing.
---
It certainly feels like sulfuras is getting less balanced over time. 66/33 sounds exactly like the game feels, with horde dominating end game farming areas most of the time
---
Ok downvotes
---
No, paladin tanks are notorious for having mana problems.
---
Just stealth earlier.  Boom.
---
Good job the addon gives you your retial experience in classic. Shame you can't actually deal with the real classic mechanics and are forced to cheat.
---
The fact that all the streamers got together on the same server seems crazy to me.
---
Big events can (and do) certainly happen without streamers. Just because you aren't on a "streamer-server", doesn't mean the realm is dead and without any events whatsoever. Seems like a case of fear of missing out combined with not knowing the situation on other servers.
---
Yes i have separate windows for both lfg and world chats and look at them only when i specificely look for pug dungeons
---
Isn't it ironic that stealth alerters have always existed since vanilla, so it would be a huge change to disable this addon, yet you're the one ranting "go back to retail"?
---
Don't try to change my game just because you can't play around addons that always existed.
---
TSM completely fucked he economy game imo, the Auction house is no longer an auction house, it's just a vendor with somewhat fluctuating prices. You don't need to know anything about pricing. No decision making process, just put it on the AH for whatever it tells you to in 99% of cases. I think addons should be for Quality of Life, not straight up changing the whole system. There are literally bots parked at the AH sniping anything you undercut automatically, that's a fucking joke.
---
I'm using LFG as we speak, it's not banned. It's a great addon.
---
why are you playing on a pvp server lol?
---
Must be the same guy who sold me Essence of Undeath to Essence of Water for 30g in week 3 in the AH ;)
---
They didnt panic that was their strategy from the start
---
There's only a few select servers where it's a big issue. I'm fairly confident Blizzard won't change it just to appease people who already chose to play on overpopulated realms.
---
He says he wants to gear for pvp, wouldn‚Äôt perp blade be better in PvP?
---
MC and OL are welll SUPER EASY. But wait till you try BwL or Naxx
---
I remember Paranoia being an addon that existed in TBC, I never saw it in Vanilla. Can you post any sources that it was available before TBC?
---
A human player will never have the same detection rate of the combat log as Spy does, but yes this is in a gray zone because if banning this then DBM and other addons should by default go aswell.
---
I use spy and I agree. It should be considered cheating.
---
&gt; Certain auras fading in and out trigger it.
---
Unfortunately it's not just that. What makes Spy so broken is that the combat log generates "x gained aura y" events when a player enters your vision range for every buff they have on them. This includes semi-permanent buffs like Battle Stance. 
---
They do not need to fade or be newly applied. That's the big broken thing about Spy right now.
---
Welcome to Classic
---
We've been 1 layer for a while, server population is typically "high". 20 of the black lotus for sale are at 46g by the same person, which makes me worried that they had inflated it and are dumping them
---
it really doesn't dude. it's not a huge deal. 
---
just know that if you Sprint or anything in stealth some people might know you're....somewhere... 
---
that said it has warned me to put on my cats eye goggles a few times but again that's based on stuff I could have seen without the add-on
---
I would sell it now. Its the same as with the priest BiS cheast.  It was nearly 200g in the time and now its only 20g on my server bc everybody has it already.  
---
The same will be true with this libram
---
Having addons alert you about stealthies is part of this game, and always has been.
---
&gt; makes me feel borderline useless in wpvp 
---
Rogues are borderline useless in wpvp with or without this addon.
---
‚ÄúDownloading pornography‚Äù
---
Yup, that was in 2005.
---
If you're trying to use it while being attacked by enemies, it will often not work since their swings still hit you after using it, this has been the case until cataclysm when they added 3s unbreakable timer on it.
---
If you're far away from mobs and they fail to untarget you (and not due to resist), then yeah that seems to be a bug. They also broke gnomish cloaking device a couple days ago apparently.
---
I remember seeing a video on here about this exact issue. I'm not a rogue player but im gonna say, yes vanish is bugged at the moment, it fails to drop aggro sometimes.
---
At least it's not &lt; 500 people total :) Well, always there is a chance all raiders from  judgement  just does not upload logs
---
Wait a moment. Did you just say that there is only one lotus per zone? (no native speaker here)
---
the add-on has saved me significantly more times that it hurt me. I have a noise that tells me when to stealth. I love it
---
Please pm me when they increase server pops and tell me I'm wrong. Ty.
---
"just don't have any buffs on you"
---
Combat log is broken, generates entries for all of your existing buffs when you enter vision range.
---
Because Tracking is a key part of the hunters toolkit. Using an addon that alerts you when a hunter can see you using Track humanoid isnt. 
---
Thats like saying "Well, Paladin has a bubble that makes him invaunerable so why cant I use a godmode script?"
---
oh thats sweet. 
---
My best one was a warlock that attacked me when they were at 20% health and i was at 50% in the crater i killed them at the time but they got a guild mate to help them kill me over and over.
---
about a weeklater i find them in felwood of all places they were grinding rep and I killed them over and over they started respawning closer and closer to the flight master but they kept dieing life was good eventualy someone killed me at the flight master I took the dura hit and hearthed to UC happy.
---
Ever Adventure
---
a cup won't suffice I might need a tub
---
Please pm me when you have a source for any of these claims. Your ass doesn't count.
---
yep, you can see a very short youtube video of me going through the build which I personally find to be the best one for classic , if you are not a NE rogue (you can go with 2 MoD if NE (using 3 is fine too if you are really nitpicky about having equal or better than 5/5 MoD):
---
21/8/22 Niar version build:  [https://youtu.be/dWc1JhnhrQo](https://youtu.be/dWc1JhnhrQo)
---
These addons were scarcely used even into tbc. Its this mind set that caused wow to go towards retial easy game mechanics. You cant deal with classic in its true form so feel the need to cheat away the difficult parts. 
---
Blizzard saw peoples need to reduce the games more punishing mechanics so implemented things themselves with that mentality in mind.
---
&gt; You don't need to know anything about pricing. No decision making process, just put it on the AH for whatever it tells you to in 99% of cases.
---
Lol no. That's a huge lie. TSM is only as good as your algorithms are. If you use the default TSM sale operations, you're not doing yourself any favors. There are plenty of cases where I ignore my TSM because the market evaluation is just incorrect for certain reasons.
---
&gt;There are literally bots parked at the AH sniping anything you undercut automatically, that's a fucking joke.
---
That's a separate issue. TSM won't auto buy anything without a direct user input.
---
A little trick you can do if you dont wanna HS is: destroy hearthstone and use stuck command and corpse run back. If HS is on cooldown you dont have to destroy it.
---
I'm so rucking jealous that I don't get to sit in server queues or get disconnected enough, or have the server crash.
---
The thing is, addons have been banned before, so rogues see an opportunity to buff their class by trying to get it banned, even though addons like this have always existed and are a part of the game too.
---
I have 4k hp as a warlock
---
Shadowlands is looking good
---
How is using an addon that gives you a big obvious pop up you being 'better at the game'?  
---
If the addon isn't doing anything beyond what you can do on your own, then why are you bothering to use it? You should be perfectly fine without it, no?
---
Saying it's not a broken addon because all it does is read the combat log is literally one of the dumbest excuses someone can give and yet it's the only one I ever see, and I see it way too often.
---
stay away from them until they're bored trying to get you out. just play a lot more cautious man it's fine 
---
this add-on is BETTER for us than it is for non rogues if you use it right. you should pretty much never be caught off guard out of stealth with it. 
---
you know exactly where they are, they just know you're in the general area. keep a distance and wait for the right moment
---
You're going to extra hell
---
Multiple spawns, only one active at a given time per zone and a 60-70min respawn timer
---
You have no clue how it works, why would you comment.
---
What confuses me is why does it detect enemy players who fly overhead on gryphons?
---
it's in the game it's not cheating.
---
I'm not calling a rogue a cheater for using what's available to him. Same for me. It's a shame they can't win in a fair open 1v1 fight but hey, that's not my problem. They chose to play on a pvp server but can only win from stealth against someone who's 10 levels lower.
---
Waide was an adept of the Cult of the Damned
---
oh that's a very sweet find, so this shuts them down 100%
---
The addon works both ways, you will detect stealth also. Use it or stay in disadvantage. It wont ruin any phase because its an inconvenience to you. Relax.
---
What has that got to do with this addon? Are you saying you turn it off when there is wpvp? Lmao.
---
The fact they have similar names like "specialisation" is irrelevant. So if two talents apply to the weapons you are using, you will benefit from both when you swing that weapon.
---
The typical fury build at 60 puts 31 points or more into fury so you can't get down to axe spec, but it would work if you picked it up.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/paranoia/
---
Vanilla had an addon already that detected invis players the same way spy does.
---
To remove spy would be to change Wow.
---
#nochanges now go away boomer
---
I'm a rogue and I hate rogues. Most of them won't take a fight unless the opponent is half health and doesn't know the rogue is there.
---
You have zero clue how this works.
---
Ahem.  Long elegant feather.  I'm on 9/10 as we speak.
---
Pretty sure havent tested it myself since im not home atm :)
---
sounds like a very vanilla-like situation to me
---
If a hunter activates track humanoid in Org and then flies to Feralas and spots me using Track I'LL get a notification about it. Because the effect hit me, not because he used an ability, but because the range of the ability he cast 10 minutes ago came upon me. How is that not breaking the entire Track Humanoid ability?
---
##OneChange
---
Do you use WiFi or a cable for internet? :)
---
No it doesnt, but it takes 4h to farm the gold to buy a flask, you dont have to craft everything yourself to raid you know :)
---
I hope you don't want to use it to snipe those stacks with shadow burn...
---
(explanation why this is bad: Shadow Burn effect takes up one debuff slot)
---
No changes
---
&gt; YES FIFTY
---
[FIFTY! YEP!](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4283/fifty-yep)
---
Oh, sorry. I was only thinking about layered servers since mine still is.
---
They will definitely go up in price still but maybe not as drastically and slower. Right now not many people use flasks but once they do the price will go up. I would say Black Lotus are generally low risk to buy. If you have some money right now and don't need it you could invest some or observe the market a bit for the next few days and then go for it.
---
No... it still works.
---
Yeah,
---
On one of the biggest private servers (12-15k online) the lotus was on a 20-30 min cd, and the price was still insane and they were very hard to find
---
If any it's a slightly horde dominated server, so yeah probably just in a level range that atm does not have to many mains/alts in it. Not much you can do about it Im afraid.
---
Whisper: Retrii, Ashlol, Soup or if they arent online any member of the "Sol in Noctem" guild! We have 2 groups with ony/mc on farm. One progressing through it and another one in the making! -Vulko
---
But then P5-P6 what do you need the money for?
---
Oh well then it was similar what I saw there.
---
Yeah if you see that mace in a BG, you should do a 360 and run away.
---
Ehh. Ok, that's shit and should be fixed. I see where the problems are coming from. 
---
Sorry. :/
---
It actually would be really intriguing to see how the game would change if this was done. Like raiding for one would be way more difficult, the skill level of the average player would most likely drop by alot. 
---
There is just so much information that is begin curated through addons. That fundamentally changes player behaviour
---
I dont have the gold to respec. I was told ON HERE to spec prot aoe and people had ao many different specs i had to respec at least 4 times to get to what worked for me.
---
It seriously sucks. When i was ret I was laughed at for being in dungeon if i was accepted. I cant quest as prot but i can dungeon and i hold aggro fine. But i dont know which is fastest to get to 60.
---
Lastly i can heal with my set of healing gear theres no need for me to respec for it. I might as well be able to tank via talents/gear and heal with gear until i finally respec for holy at 60
---
But don't
---
You can still hide inside buildings. Just don't do anything that makes you appear in the combat log, which can be read by anyone - with or without addons. And even then, people will not know where you are exactly.
---
Well, not every addon since vanilla actually did have an even more open API and could produce heavier addons. The addons we have today is mostly changes to UI and "smoother" looking lighter version of addons we had back in vanilla.
---
But the spy addon is just game breaking =( And yeah, F those #nochangers, the reason vanilla turned out to  be so fun was because of all the small patches and small changes all the time.
---
I just love to be able to buy mounts in the store...
---
/s (in case that wasn't obvious)
---
I ran BRD over 130 times before I ever even saw a Gladiator chain drop. 
---
I saw maybe 2-3 hours during that stretch.
---
Even in MC it's higher dps than frost. Just unfortunate that two of the bosses are immune to fire.
---
What's the smallest possible change you could make to your class which would have the biggest quality of life or balance improvement?
---
Bonus points for the smallest change.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve set up addons to auto loot and auto vend trash so I don‚Äôt even notice it anymore
---
Literally every prebc pvp video has the combat log open in a different chat window for this exact reason.
---
Thanks you for the advice. Helps me a ton
---
Grinding tube8 from 1 to 30 then switch to pornhub until pre bis. Xporn for endgame raid.
---
Not only that but it also allows me to click his portrait and target him , even if he's LoS'ing me inside a building or behind a tree.
---
Helped another war get it on Saturday evening. Still on anger. Think it goes to emp p5?
---
dead servers dont count lol
---
damn, did retail fuck you mom or something?
---
I'd still take spy ten times over manually reading the chat and not having an easy way to target them. It's op come on
---
No, they are not. Go watch the duel league and that Rogues are not op at all.
---
Addons like spy were in vanilla. They cannot be broken without disabling key functionality; addons reading chatlines is important for all sorts of stuff.
---
That might work for a level 60 Rogue for which their sole focus is ganking, but I don't feel like it lends itself to the world PvP environment where an opportunistic Rogue that is levelling, gathering or travelling might stumble upon an enemy organically.
---
For clarity, I have never played a Rogue myself but this add on seems like it damages the surprise factor of  random encounters in world PvP.
---
Thanks for the constructive comment.
---
In ph1 to ph3/4 hemo swords is better. When other people get geared and you get More gear, backstabbing rogue is better for PvP.
---
Technically it's true that "warriors do better dps with it than ret paladins". But it's not good for warrior PVE, you don't really want to 2H on alliance side, and I'm pretty sure BRE beats it anyway. Even in PVP it's gotta be a close call.
---
But hey it's an iconic weapon and it doesn't really matter if it's not as good as you'd expect from a legendary.
---
:&lt;
---
How did you source Hide of the Wild? I looked at mats yesterday and realised I wouldn't be able to get it for less than about 320g, mainly due to sourcing Essence of Water, which go for about 25g each on my server.
---
Came in expecting a 19 twink just bullying level 12 or 15 people in The Barrens. Your twink looks badass mate and well played.
---
P.S. whats the name of the song in the video?
---
Try Inventorian
---
I went horde because my friend went horde.
---
21 days. So you're wrong. I corrected you.
---
Since all Servers are running on a maximum of 2 layers, i think Not that much. Many are already Farming instances anyway
---
It does reduce pure surprise world PvP encounters that much is true however if you are a rogue or druid you are quite capable of catching random players totally off guard as always. You just need to travel stealthed a lot more to ensure no one sees you in the combat log. A leveling player would definitely have issues if they are mounted moving from quest spot to spot. But again they don't have to be at this disadvantage, they choose to be because of time saving.
---
The amount of idiot carebears in this comment section is so high lol. Imagine being so fucking dumb that you can't understand a rock/paper/scissor type of game.
---
Impossible? No. Will price increase? Of course. Supply of items that people farm non-stop in the open world
---
Like black lotus and arcane crystals will 100% increase in price Because the overall supply of the nodes will be halved.
---
Find  a tank who will reserve the orbs for strat. Split them.
---
If you're amongst the top 50 levelers and literally all competition is in ZF then enjoy the truly uncontested questing? 
---
This doesn't add up.
---
YOU STILL NEED TO DROP AND RELEARN, the book only works if you dropped and reskilled to 215+ and it only saves you the initiation quest of the other spec
---
I think the despawn timer of Ragnaros/Domus is 2h after that you have to kill Domus again without getting loot
---
Also AV had lotus which brought a lot more in.
---
Not sure if it is a skill difference, I just feel like people overvalue racials over massive class difference.
---
Paladins in premades are DISGUSTING. They have heal power stronger than a priest, utility that is unrivaled (offensively and defensively), AND they wear plate.
---
Sure you can have a 15% chance to resist a *stun* or break a fear, but when a warrior is chasing you with blessing of freedom and a pally who can dispel basically any CC you throw at the warrior, it's a bit scary.
---
For warlocks, how important is imp's phase shift in dungeons?
---
You're projecting.  Just because I point out the flaws in your posts doesn't mean I'm salty at all, just trying to help you out.  Like I said, hope life gets better for you x

this.

Undead Strat for necklace

Some of these can be replaced with others. These are just the ones I personally went after.
---
Don‚Äôt even worry about your level and just try and heal those chasing after the pieces you need.
---
The "wpvp is exactly the same as dueling" is even funnier than what OP wrote regarding the spy addon. Wanna thank all of you skillful rogues for sharing your grievances on how hard the wpvp is.
---
also my dude, name a better wpvp class than rogue.
---
You should really provide more info, what part failed? Where did you fail?
---
&gt; 6'6" 
---
The mountain that types.
---
Just did it tonight. You do have to kill domo again and you don‚Äôt get loot.
---
Try exquisitus on firemaw. Casual / friendly guild.
---
Perdition's Blade.
---
This is how it works. You  have to do the Majordomo event again. I think the reset time is only 2 hours or so.
---
Big if true.
---
You'd just turn it on for raids and stuff. Don't have it be permanent, have it be a toggle.
---
You cannot.
---
You can however make a macro to use it on leftclick, create it on rightclick. Need to update the macro with spell and itemid as you get new ranks.

---
Glad I dont have to deal with lfg or world anymore.
---
During actual Vanilla, you could jump out of there if you jumped towards the corners. It took some few attempts but but if you were persistent it got you out.
---
It wouldn't break warcraft logs because that goes off the text file in your game folder.
---
But yeah any addon remotely dependent on log would break, and that's far more than the obvious Details!
---
Are you going to go for rank 14 again?
---
How did you come to 8 spellpower? It's 1% chance to do 850 damage or 8.5 on average, but since frostbolt has a 83% coefficient that 8.5 extra damage would be closer to 10-11 spellpower.
---
Secretly just showing of /played
---
Waterfak.
---
I thought my 2 crystals + 1 saphire from 4 nodes was special.
---
For main hand. If you are a rogue and doing &gt; 50% of your damage through auto attacks / white damage then off hand is a significant part of your damage and you need more to offset the default OH miss rate.
---
Except that noone in the world runs around with a OTP spec like Soul Link, and is 120% prepared to face a rogue at any time, also having the perfect kind of trinket, weapon and pet setup to deal with any incoming class.
---
No, dueling and wpvp isn't comparable.
---
no boomer. The fact that it was in vanilla, which classic wow is aiming to emulate justifies its existence.
---
Thats where you are wrong kiddo üòâ
---
Paladins dont have taunt. 
---
But please, show me a more threat generating AoE ability than buffing BOK?
---
Just spam that BoK button on a class with 5-6 people within 30 yards of the mobs, and watch how good an AoE tank paladins are. 
---
Still no taunt though...
---
The summoning circle doesn't appear
---
Why couldn't you just not show opposing factions abilities in the combat log? Seems like that would fix it and not break damage meters.
---
Auto-run to Onyxia from Brackenwall Village: ‚úì
---
If every quest was as straightforward as killing 5 black bears in an area that's full of black bears, you'd run out of quests in each zone a lot faster than usual. Having these quests where you need to kill more than the quest asks for is actually a way to get players to grind mobs without it feeling like they're grinding for nothing.
---
twink pvp is not pvp. fuck off
---
Yeah unless you re on Gehennas or Firemaw you re either fucked now or long term.
---
Thank you for your reply. That was the answer I was looking for. :)
---
Why you repeated the same thing 3 times? And retail for a long time is all about end game.
---
How else would you show how much damage you've got and from which abilities?
---
Or maybe when I tamed it I renamed it cause I didn't like it named Cat but Brokentooth? ü§Ø
---
This sub is literally turning into Facebook for classic WoW chars.

You brought this upon yourselves, you streamer worshipping N'wahs.
---
I farmed the essence of water and larval acid myself, bought the living essence for about 3g per, a guildie cut me a deal on the cured rugged hide, and then another guildie made it for me
---
rofl. its not that stealth is off in classic, its that youre probably used to how it is in retail. in retail, stealth is basically just invisibility ie. no way to take them out till they decide too.
---
classic stealth is actually fantastic.
---
That is still quite different from having every objective slapped onto your map and even TomTom arrows pointing you in every witch way for a list of quests. The information might be more or less the same, but the access and in-your-face-ness puts that and Questie (and similar addons) worlds apart.
---
Just only show the enemy faction abilities that interact with or damage you.
---
Removal of layering will certain items available from the open world more expensive. The best example of this is black lotus that you (as far as I know) only can get from the open world.
---
The removal of layers and introduction  of the honor system should force more people into dungeons. So I would guess that dungeon loot, such as orbs from Strat live, may get a bit less expensive.
---
Very. Usually you don't attack with the Imp at all (set to passive), to keep it up for the tanks.
---
Ad hominem attacks, the hallmark of those with an actual cogent point.
---
calm down. It is pvp. Don't be butthurt about utt
---
Why are you fully tier 1 bis?
---
Nice!
---
He was carrying The 1 Ring.
---
If it's phase shifted, it can't die to AoE and it can't accidentally pull agro. If neither of those are a concern, it isn't very important.
---
Same. All these delicious rouge tears only make it sweeter.
---
1000g is alot
---
I dont understand how addons like that are even allowed. How is it not cheating to have an addon tell you when someone is nearby?
---
Not once have I said OP. However I said "easiest class to wpvp" like 50 times, because it is. There is by far nothing easier in the game than going from stealth to a minimum 10sec stun on someone killing a mob, if there is, once again, name a class, and SL lock/spriest is bs and you know it.
---
&gt;It would because your party members are not "enemy faction".
---
For tryhard DPS every other DPS is "enemy faction". There can only be one number one!
---
I'm parsing 99% logs on warcraftlogs and laughing my ass off atm.
---
The range on the mini map is attocious sometimes.
---
Regardless, i remember leveling in vanilla on pvp server when honor was implemented.
---
Currently it is overhyped that leveling will be unplayable.
---
You have gankers now and will have next week a bit more.
---
You can easily figure out how many ticks it needs to be worth the mana cost. It's worth using only if you are killing mobs slower than a certain speed.
---
Haha yea I had to read it twice to make sure I knew what he was saying after I saw your comment
---
So what was he wearing vs what he could be wearing, genius?
---
I think the main issue is that spy impacts how much fun other players have negatively whereas something like dbm doesn't explicitly have much/any impact on someone not using it.
---
Stay mad lololol
---
Damage bonus of pets is determined from the sub type. All cats have the same damage modified and the same crit chance. Only difference is attack speed for pvp.
---
There are some additional things to consider for pets. 
---
Owls have AoE focus dump ability which does AoE theat.
---
Wolves have furious howl for damage for party members in 15 yard range etc 
---
But at the end of the day the dps between the different types of pet is negligible at best
---
&gt; Lfg was a make raiding easier tool
---
lol
---
Often it they were that hard I'd rather use the mana on Mend Pet.
---
DBM tracks stuff that are pre determined to happen tho
---
I think having it tied to an item makes it likely that you will either replace it or that it will be removed. They should add it as a talent tree or something similiar which is part of our characters.
---
I‚Äôd love if they don‚Äôt. I like the fact flasks are rare, and maybe bosses will remain alive a bit more than 1 night...
---
Not even sure about this...
---
Same in duskwood. Really annoyed me
---
If you don't condone racist behavior then you probably shouldn't be condoning people using that word.
---
Being that prepared, you probably could have gotten your name on multiple servers that were being released afterwards.
---
I don't personally use it but a couple of the guys in my guild do. Whenever we're out in the world they're calling out enemy players minutes before we ever see them. It feels really cheap and I don't like it.
---
Yeah true, didn't think about it that way!
---
I wish + healing also increased holy damage or that a lot of our healing gear had mixed +healing/+spell damage on them.
---
Alright sweet thanks for the quick reply
---
Same 6 Rag kills no dagger. It does feel bad :/
---
Your Imp does not harbor any warm feelings regarding BiS-lists, I see. Probably a wise fellow.

You might need to tweak it slightly, based on not having some schematics or some mats varying in price, but it's been pretty good and efficient for me
---
While this is slightly annoying the fact that I can stand a bit further down a ramp when making ranged pulls and hit a mob slightly further away when I'm webbed or rooted makes up for it.
---
Awesome tool!

Had a great moment in game the other day wher 4/5 of our guildies were already in BRD with the 5th on his way. He tells us he's getting chased by a level 60 so we head out to help him. We set up an ambush right after the jump, he runs past, the second the other guy passes all 5 of us just unload on the guy and drop him instantly. It was awesome.

Try leveling on kromcrush. The horde have killed me without hesitation every time they see me, typically skull since I'm 37. I'm actually hitting that point where I want to abandon the server because the horde are strait up assholes. Do they even want lvl 60 pvp? Are they going to bitch about long battleground ques after they make even the prospect of leveling damn near impossible?  If you're on kromcrush horde, you need to talk to your boys. Strait up dishonorable cunts atm
---
I decided to kill 100 dust stormers here the other day. Started out way better than i expected and after 45 kills i had 4 Essence of air. After 100 kills i still had 4... Its completly random and i might have got 8 in the next 50 kills its all about RNG and over time it usually evens out.
---
Are you saying it gives different amounts for damage and for healing? I have a hard time believing that.
---
You'll obviously get an extra +25 healing if you go for the +55 healing enchant compared to this, but also 30 less damage. Depends on what you're enchanting and how often you do some offspec DPS.
---
but resources respawn after a server restart
---
Yeah so let me just stealth 100 meters away from everyone and slow-walk to my targets only for me to die to 35 DoTs and 538 AoEs while being insta-targeted by every warrior and hunter in existence.
---
^ this guy supports Blizzard repressing free speech for üá®üá≥

Nah, we just have different views of what WPVP is. 
---
Your definition seems to be someone ganking you.
---
Buy all of em, will skyrocket when BWL comes.
---
&gt; This addon is the core of how classic became retail.
---
I had a spy-like addon in vanilla, VanaKoS - you could even click to target. Fuck off.
---
You don't need to install the addon if you don't like it.
---
how you can play with these keybinds?
---
&gt;Yeah so let me just stealth 100 meters away from everyone and slow-walk to my targets only for me to die to 35 DoTs and 538 AoEs while being insta-targeted by every warrior and hunter in existence.
---
Nope, Shadow Priests are the strongest PvP class in the game and maybe Elemental Shamans.
---
Get help from guilduies, or other people. 
---
The charms can be bought off the AH.
---
The elementals are 38 and absolute pain until you are very close.
---
I got the ww axe at lvl 33, but really was carried lol
---
Also after getting the charms you need to summon a lvl 40 elite and kill it!
---
PS: Warrior solo advice: kill mobs that are green for you. At least that's what's working for me, as I pretty much have no downtime and no misses/less parries so it's way faster even if the individual xp per mob is less
---
Well bis for pvp stat wise is more stamina. But bis for pve is all damage. You don't wanna be pvping in devilsaurs and leathers.
---
Is this what you do everytime when someone actually responds to you? Just gaslight your way out of it? You obviously are very sensitive or else you wouldn't be complaining so much about a single word.
---
Quick question: Can you use Decursive?
---
How did you grind as a resto druid? I am a holy pala and my dps is pathetic even with some pretty decent retribution gear.
---
I'm just trolling the rogues who are bad at 1v1 pvp against someone their own level.
---
Thank you mate, the Song is from Sick Puppies you are going down :)
---
What race are you? Are you saying the summoning circle at your race's spot to summon the actual warlock to fight isn't where it's supposed to be?
---
You overaggro, nearly die, run around with 15% health and then die to AoE.
---
Maybe run out of the AoE and bandage when half the raid is at 50% health? This is why people look down on melees. 
---
Does the raid lead still have to tell the melees to not stand in fire after 15 years? Micromanaging noobs is the reason why people dont like raid leading.
---
Wouldn't this stop you from seeing all channel messages though? If channel is pink and that's what he removed does that mean you won't see any/every channel anymore?
---
Elvui

 Yeah so let me just stealth 100 meters away from everyone and slow-walk to my targets only for me to die to 35 DoTs and 538 AoEs while being insta-targeted by every warrior and hunter in existence.
---
Why says everyone that the price will go up with blacklotus when BWL is around? Is there something special in BWL?
---
There are 4 zones that spawn then, Burning Steppes, Silithus, Winterspring, and EPL. Only 1 Lotus can spawn in each of those zones at a time (IE: Only possible for 4 lotuses to be spawned at a time on the whole server.) They have about an hour to 2 hour respawning timer.
---
It detects at the combat log distance, not nameplate distance, otherwise you wouldn't your DPS in boss as a hunter at max range. The combat log covers a radius of ~200 yards if I'm not mistaken. Nameplate range is capped at 20 yards, which is 10 times less.
---
I haven't done and wont. You dont need to use aim bots in fps games if you dont want isnt exactly a good argument for why aimbots should be allowed.
---
I'm usually renewing squishy dps since rank 3 renew usually heals for about 1k. I don't use it on tanks. I will try out rank 3 heal yeah. Also, when should I cast greater heal or even if I ever should?
---
"Gaming chairs" are the fucking stupidest marketing gimic I've ever seen. I almost fell for it a few years ago too, thank god I didn't. I'm perfectly happy with my $100 staples chair.
---
Wouldn't wanna shine a UV light in that room, or the basement.
---
I'm moonglow specced, so my balance spells are all buffed a fair bit. With roots often times I can kill mobs before they can touch me, so my lower health doesn't matter
---
So you dont help your guildies out either? Or you quit.
---
You know, you Can try to level up while being a casual player. So did I, and I‚Äôm a casual.
---
I suspect you wrote this comment, because you felt bad about you own /played, and didn‚Äôt want some casuals leveling as fast, or faster than you :D
---
spriest is really strong but a bit dull. literally a monkey could play spriest and beat every other class. 
---
Now mage and druid both have some depth. but are not as strong.
---
mage has a few different pvp builds, elemental, deepfrost impcs, the infamous pompyro. Druid on the other hand is invaluable is wsg for flag carrying and can escape pretty much any unwanted matchup.
---
Pal can never win vs mage because cannot interrupt sheep. Bubble early and playing offensive is the only chance to get a cheeky win.
---
Yes that's where I got the necklace n yea I was in the right room the human girl was by the back wall just no summoning circle at all
---
No, they don't. Whoever said that is wrong. I've literally experienced it where an enemy rogue jumped me and never showed up on spy.
---
lol for what? Showing up to a quest area and killing quest mobs?
---
Don't even mention that, people always randomly whisper me to tank some random dungeon. It's annoying. I am a dps warrior, I don't tank and forcing me to tank is selfish af. Only people who want to tank should tank.
---
Hi guys, im on My First 60 Char ever (Priest). Since I don't have any experience on how different specs play out I'd like to try out some different specs . Does re-spec costs go down again if i dont respec for a while or will it forever be 50g if it once gets that high?
---
Not even close to speed run.
---
Kirtonos, hopefully the balance is a little better now.
---
Yeah, if they're smart they'll spread out their sales to keep the price high. I'm not even going to benefit from this, but it makes too much sense not to.
---
Is your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù a notorious gold seller and you‚Äôre asking if you‚Äôll get banned?
---
Yeah, most likely.
---
SP are never god awful in premade lmao. The sheer amount of utility a SP brings is enough itself to justify having one; the damage is just really good as well.
---
That's insane. Why anyone would be crazy enough to farm them for 20g each is beyond me.
---
Flasks are currently 80-120g on mankrik. That train has most certainly left the station.
---
Flag in wpvp... Sure
---
I want to sell my gold too, what site are you using?
---
Spy only shows an enemy character that has used a spell.  I've had tons of horde walk right by me and Spy doesn't show it.
---
yeah it does suck but no way anyone is getting rid of it
---
Horde "1v1" means "me and my 5 friends vs you".
---
wpvp = open world combat, dont know of any other definitions.
---
Thought the whole argument of this thread that the spy addon is fucking rogues is in small pvp context, most likely ganking or 1v1? If were talking raid vs raid then it becomes even more ridiculous.  
---
*spy addon tells that a rogue stealthed nearby"
---
* /r BRACE YOURSELF LADS, DONT MIND THE OTHER 30 ALLY THAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US, MY ADDON TELLS ME THAT A ROGUE HAS ENTERED STEALTH, RED ALERT, I REPEAT, RED ALERT *
---
i do enjoy the stealth noise they chose, ROMULANS!
---
aimbots aren't an official supported part of the game. apples and oranges
---
But aimbots ARE allowed in many console games so if they're in the game, they're in the game.
---
How can they target you if they don't know you're there and you're invisible?
---
&gt;slow-walk to my targets
---
This is your problem, you refuse to accept a minor handicap while gaining a massive advantage in PvP. I was right. These types are too lazy to get the jump and would rather whine and complain about an add-on that's completely fair for everyone else. It's sad.
---
Spriest for sure
---
I usually give then 50% of the vendor value of whats inside the box.
---
Shaman healer here - I got [The Earthfury chest](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16841/earthfury-vestments) but I was using this [Red Dragonscale Breastplate](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15047/red-dragonscale-breastplate#created-by-spell) beforehand and honestly, at least for healing I feel like the red dragonscale breastplate is still better, until I get like a set bonus from earthfury, which means I need at minimum two more earthfury pieces.
---
What do you healers think? Earthfury feels like a good pick to wear for PVP of course but for PVE I think red dragonscale is better until I get more tier 1 pieces.
---
keep trying? lots of the early friends i made leveling quit or leveled at a way different pace then me, tbh i didnt find my current guild until i was already 60 and mostly pre-bis (tbh i got lucky cuz its an amazing group of folks) but i basically went from solo playing to having a bunch of people to play with at all times, we're even making alts together  
---
you could also try the various discords for the server you play on to see if anyone in your level range wants to group
---
Let me guess, ogre shamans in Feralas.
---
The problem with those quests is that those mobs have shared spawns. If people only kill one type of them, you will end up with situations like on the picture.
---
Or even better is the quest in WPL to kill wolves. They have shared spawns with the spiders. There's no quest to kill the spiders. I've run around the place and there was not a single wolf, so i started killing spiders and eventually the wolves were coming back.
---
Beatle stuff is the last quest I completed, I remember it being horrible from when I played vanilla - an indicator that it's not nice, if you remember something from almost 15 years back. It's more manageable with good AoE, but still not nice.
---
Give us shamans a totem recall
---
Not a class but a race thing:
---
Taurens on a mount should be able to fit through all the same doors that other races can.  
---
It's annoying having to dismount to get into undercity, and a few other random places.
---
Damn, I never saw the sons even with pugs.
---
Bro you can click their name on the add-on and if they're in range it targets them. I've done it to many people trying to walk up on my farm spots. Spy needs to be banned.
---
Because people are trying to be efficient and level efficiently. The easiest and most efficient way to do that is to run a lot of mages. Why is this difficult to understand?
---
Yes please!
---
They don't really bring anything that disc/holy doesn't - you bring priests for dispels, healing and mana burning. And their damage really isn't spectacular. What makes shadow strong is that they effectively wear plate on top of dispels while doing respectable damage, combined with offensive and defensive dispels. They simply wear people out. Their weakness in organized PvP is that they run out of mana *very* fast, and you'll rarely have a chance to drink up.
---
there will be a spec spike just like there was when dm was released early, and then it will go back down, but eventually settle higher than before  
---
so basically  yes, but not as bad as it will seem initially
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-1853/
---
Look at when it was created
---
Cool
---
Yes right you need at least 6k mana.
---
You could buy int-potions etc. to increase mana but as said being disc makes it much easier.
---
Why do you need to be holy?
---
Actually I think they wouldnt even notice if you switch to disc, expect of course if you buff Power Infusion.
---
Sounds like you don't know what you are talking about. Oh well, enjoy your massively overpopulated realm and the many joys that come with it. Hey, at least you get to experience the streamer events!
---
Yea crazy.  They go about 15-20g on mine lol.  But its medium pop.
---
There's not enough shamans.
---
Why? I really don't see the reason for it and I'm a rogue who probably is hurt the most from it. If you need total surprise attack on your opponent you probably not a very good player in the first place.
---
Joining full, but not absolutely shitshow servers like Faerlina is the best imho.
---
More like  
---
Black Bear Slain: 40/40  
---
Bear pelts found: 3/40
---
interesting because a lock in my guild was telling me how with ISB procs ideally all the locks would be shadowburning it and then going back to 2 spam
---
Hello fellow Ferlawl!
---
I run the same point distribution as you do, with imp. Shred and 1 point in savage fury.
---
0 Points in Feral Aggression
---
3 Points in Feral Instinct.
---
Now, when playing imp. Shred you gotta play offensive.
---
I see alot of druids opening in cat and then just staying in Bear and finally lose.
---
Alot of NS/HotW Druids like to do this and its
---
 dumb.
---
Improved Shred with Powershifting is insanely strong and unserrated, cause most people just cant handle the required focus.
---
Go improved Shred and give em Hell.
---
For me, peraonally, imp. Shred Feral is one of the strongest PvP Builds there is, when played correctly.
---
When this occurs, remind yourself this is saving you time from grinding outside of a quest. Granted you can farm items, but if you're grinding for a quest it's better than grinding just to grind.
---
As I said before, you are projecting your feelings and assumptions onto my comments.  I don't approve of murder, rape or mass genocide but that doesn't mean I'm sensitive to it, racism is no different.   My sympathy was meant genuinely- you seem to be in a shitty place.  Not everyone wishes others ill by default.
---
Yeah, Spy is like debuff timers.  Some add-ons just make the game unbalanced in favour of certain classes.
---
Oh, thanks, i'll look into. Will have to look where at backend √¢ character converts to a, lol... Sad thing names are saved like this already, so no fix asap. Thanks again, ill try to figure out what to do.
---
If he use his main and not a lvl 1 character he okey. Gold sellers use lvl 1 characters so it's suspcious, if he send it with a lvl 60 it's totaly normal.
---
You're most likely in the wrong place, search the cellar more  thoroughly
---
Polymorph is ridiculous. Me, a holy paladin, and my Mage guildie ran into a Mage/priest combo in WPL. The Mage sheeped me right from the start, I bubbled out of it, they waited for me to lose bubble and immediately sheeped me again. I was in sheep form the entire fight. Never had time to get a blessing of sacrifice on my Mage to get me out. Literally could not do anything. After my Mage was dead the two of them just fucked with me for a while, alternating between sheeping and mind control.
---
Pathetic
---
Im still missing some reports. If you want yourself here asap, you can PM me your nickname + server, or WLogs link, ill add you manually
---
I remember hunters could just macro steady shot and killcommand to do top dps at start of wotlk, good times.
---
Burning steppes, silithus and winterspring
---
Right now most guilds can clear MC without even the tanks flasking. When BWL releases the difficulty goes way up (from what I've read, I play played vanillar), and people will need to flask to progress.
---
&gt; Because it‚Äôs a huge server 
---
That's a downside in my opinion. I don't need a "huge" server, but rather one with a healthy population. Problems with a "huge" server are plentiful in my opinion, especially in a game like Classic. What is your sense of community if the community is so large that everyone is just a drop in the sea? Might aswell have cross-realm open world in that case. 
---
&gt; with good faction balance
---
Hmm, do you have anything showing the faction balance? I've seen reports from Faerlina players in both direction (H/A favored). 
---
&gt;  active wPvP and fun events?
---
And you think these things aren't there on other servers or something?
---
Doesn't that addon just read what's in your combat text? Also, even if you are detected you are still in stealth and even if your enemy is aware of your presence it doesn't change much at all.
---
I remember skipping school on a Wednesday to play wow only to find out
---
Limits for enemy players, thats pretty clever.
---
I called my priest molestinator
---
Thats what I have ATM, for DME lashers, cause I don't have time for big group dungeons after work. But I think I fucked up some points, even though it still works I'm thinking about doing a "new" 31/20 disc spec. 
---
Was a bit annoyed by everyone losing their minds when I wanted to heal as SP while leveling
---
LFG/TRADE as a world chat.
---
I should have chosen a pve server.
---
Hunters. All you need to care about is your bow.
---
Just got this classic version of the game and I can‚Äôt decide which class to play. On the retail version I played demo lock because the theme of it was cool, and I also played fury warrior because I liked the fast rotation. Does the classic fury warrior have a fun, fast rotation, and is the classic warlock gameplay any fun too? Or maybe should I play another class if what I‚Äôm looking for is a fast rotation?
---
It massivly depends on the speed of your group, and how many side bosses you go after. But...
---
LBRS/Scholo are about 1.5-2 hours.
---
UBRS is 45min
---
Strat is probably an hour on each side.
---
You are comparing apples and oranges. Warriors and SP fill completely different roles; and having resilient damage dealers is always useful.
---
On top of that you are already displacing the conversation toward what could be the most optimal composition, whereas we were initially discussing just how good they are. SP are extremely useful in group PvP; if you wish to discuss what's the best 10 men group possible, that's another conversation.
---
I was literally a rogue main from 2006 to 2008. It was my first character and my only character in vanilla. I was considered by many on my server Lethon to be one of the top rogues there. Stealth for world PvP IS a massive advantage, even with spy running on virtually every account today. And no, people don't have a way to fight back if you exploit stealth to the fullest and have some freaking patience. You will ALWAYS get the jump, and you will ALWAYS be able to pick the most opportune moment to strike because of that guarantee. If you can't understand how massive that is for ganking I don't know what to tell you. This isn't fucking arena. People don't know they're up against you out the gates and execute strategy. They're out chilling doing their own thing oblivious to you. Just getting opened up on at random is enough to throw most people off hard and give you time to burn them down and work them. Fuck, if you're subtlety you have no excuse to complain. Rogues are the most broken 1v1 class in vanilla and that counts especially so when talking about world PvP. Stop complaining and start enjoying being easy mode.
---
How is the stealth addon called ?
---
This is basically the cold war in a nutshell :D
---
It breaks a game mechanic
---
&gt; Earthfury feels like a good pick to wear for PVP of course but for PVE I think red dragonscale is better until I get more tier 1 pieces.
---
I agree with this. Would much rather get a weapon, shield or trinket in lieu of 1-2 tier pieces at the moment for PvE, but the stats are quite solid for PvP. Beats wearing this teal dress on my poor troll - but it goes rather well with her skin tone, hair and cloak. 
---
I also don't like the T1 set bonus that much, it makes your worst form of healing (single target) more efficient, whereas T2 boosts your most iconic and efficient spell; Chain Healing.
---
How did LfG made raiding easier? Did it kill the bosses for you or what? Same with this spy addon, u either use it or start scanning the combat log, outcome is the same. If you‚Äôre a rogue complaining about this addon you‚Äôre a shit rogue and u should re-roll.
---
That's what you get for thinking you could do Santa's work.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that, because in OSRS if you trade too much gold they ban you for real world currency trading. It isn‚Äôt really a wild question if he came from other mmos.
---
100% man. I said it above, this is the exact same mentality as ‚Äòraid finder just helps people find groups easier, they were going to do the raid anyway!‚Äô
---
Exact same thing here, yes you COULD scan your combat log literally ever second of the game, but that‚Äôs literally impossible. Majority of players don‚Äôt even play with the combat log open.

Zygor is by far the best guide/AddOn if you want to level as quickly as possible, while still being able to watch Netflix :)
---
I just finished leveling my 2nd character to lvl 60, and i¬¥m planning on leveling a 3rd character, all because of how smooth the leveling journey is with Zygor.
---
However, I never reached Artisan engineering. 240 was just enough to craft a Gnomish Death Ray.

It could be that Artisan engineering is a pre-requisite to use the book without dropping the profession or something.

As to whether the science of sampling holds true for this as well is debatable. Only Blizzard knows. Considering we don't have a better way, this is as good as it will be unless Blizzard releases data or changes add-on rules.

If the warlock had the addon he would have known you were near him in stealth.....

I'm not sure I understand what you mean. "GoDylon" didn't lie in saying it was a repost, I posted it originally like 15 minutes ago but someone corrected me in saying P2 was pushed back. So I deleted it and fixed the title. Think he's just upset that it showed up twice which is fair I guess

---
well yes, shadowpriest, not shadowformpriest
---
I've specifically been talking about organized, optimal PvP, where shadow (like many other specs and even entire classes) don't really have a niche. Shadow is amazing for world PvP and general BGs. But they won't ever see the inside of the rank-14 grind groups.
---
You can't just 'ban' this addon. It uses onEvent calls to the event API " COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED".
---
The only way to block this is to prevent calls to those events. This breaks not only every DPS meter but it breaks any mod using the combat log. 
---
Blizzard is not going to break hundreds of mods for this one, sorry.
---
There is no way to ban specific addons. An addon just runs LUA code that the game allows to be run. If the calls are allowed then the addon works, if the event calls are not allowed it does not work.
---
This addon will never be broken because of this, they are not about to go break every addon using the same event calls, sorry.

You forgot buff limit. Have fun losing your songflower when a healer tries to HOT you.

My Obsidian Edged Sword gives +8 weaponskill, and that lands me at 313 2h-sword skill. 
---
My current research leaves to believe that 313 weaponskill, should hitcap me at around 5%, instead of the usual 9%, and is this hit-rating gear really the best for me with this sword?

I am going to be replacing the sword eventually, but for now, should i replace the devilsaur set with something with more strength/attackpower instead?

I have 4/5 in improved mind blast so I can do two mindflays between each mind blast. I go OOM after about 1min30s on single target dps, but many bosses only take about 1 min. Also you are expected to use one major mana potion + one dark rune/daemonic rune for each fight. If you know that you will go OOM, make sure you atleast have mana for keeping SWP up and downrank mind flays.

For every player afraid to switch off to a dead server, 1000 other players that would go to that same server are thinking the same thing. The mob mentality is hurting the playerbase, not Blizzard.
---
It helps everyone equally. It doesn't tell you where someone is, you still have to use your eyes. Even with a rogue showing up on spy because he was too lazy and impatient to stalk about in stealth preemptively, people can still drop their guard and figure you aren't after them. It just takes waiting a minute for them to continue on their way and it's like the add-on isn't there at all. People are just in zoom zoom mode today and don't have the patience to fully exploit the power of stealth and everything has to be fast fast fast. They need to ride up on their epic mount, dismount and stealth 20 yards behind the target. It's whining from the elite and I frankly don't give a damn to hear it.

Lastly blizzard can't kill the add-on. It's physically impossible. They'd have to hide enemy spell casts, something that would have major ramifications on PvP far beyond some list of nearby players. Imagine not getting notified the enemy is casting a certain spell? Can't have it. Thus there is nothing they can do to break it.
---
I have to admit, I kinda like this idea...
---
Tracking feels same same as I remember it from vanilla. Good but no where near amazing. Not sure how much it differs in classic if it does.

Well, that's moving the goalposts, you originally said:
---
&gt; Just only show the enemy faction abilities that interact with or damage **you**. 
---
What I mean is that, for example, when a partymember is hit by a certain very avoidable spell (Arcanist Doan's explosion or something) I would like to read that from recount, in order to get better at that encounter. IIRC that is what Recount currently does and that won't be possible anymore if it:
---
&gt;Just only show the enemy faction abilities that interact with or damage **you**. 
---
And that's what I originally meant with my comment. Of course if non-combat abilities are removed from the log that would definitely improve the chances of breaking spy. Don't get me wrong, I don't like it either.
---
The honorsystem is coming on the 14th (thursday).
---
There might be people out there getting a feel for it a few days ahead but doubt it'll be that many.
---
How many times have you heard your RL tell Shamans to "remove totems" from the previous trash mob fight at the Onyxia entrance? 
---
Totemic Recall would be sweet indeed.
---
My bad. I will rephrase it correctly: Already stealthed players \_can\_ show up. Not always.
---
Incendius is amazingly balanced
---
The summoning circle is always there.
---
You're at the wrong place.
---
The only way to break Spy is by preventing event calls to a specific API called " COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED" . This same API call is used by literally hundreds of mods and even the chat box that presents the combat log itself.

Yeah, not happening.

Usage of "please" is not permitted and punishable by death.
---
Apparently.
---
Same place where I dinged 60 on my warrior :)
---
People claimed for Classic for it's "purer" or more hardcore nature, but they do everything to make it similar to retail's ease of gameplay.
---
I‚Äôm glad Blizzard didn‚Äôt listen to the community and only released 5 PVP servers (pre-region specific tabs) at launch üôÇ
---
&gt;I mean with all raids camping at flight spots, killing everyone and at the entrance of the dungeons?
---
Nothing new then, especially if the flight master is the one at LHC and the entrance of the dungeon is at BRM or DM.
---
They don't care about rank. They want battles against other lvl19 twinks, because then it is a matter of pure skill who wins. It's way easier to max out a lvl19 character - and that character then stays maxed out until the end of vanilla. So you always have some fun/competitive battles on this twinks.
---
You can solo jump runs as any ranged class, saves you on splitting gold :)
---
Haha yup!
---
This is exactly why I rolled hunter. I wanna try something that isnt expected. Care to share your talent spec?
---
You are spending 13 (!) points for 3% hit, and hit cap is, what, 5 or 6% in PvP? I'm mainly healing, so can't recall melee hit requirements, but it's way lower than the 9% for PvE. 
---
That should be easily attainable from gear/racials, though, whereas 10% damage (everything melee-based that you do, which is the vast majority of all your damage) I imagine is way more difficult to compensate for in terms of +AP/crit you'd need on gear. I've seen similar builds put forth before, but never any really positive feedback on them. I think cookie cutter builds exist for a reason (at least in this case), as boring as that may sound.
---
Probably not the actual color since this mongoloid photographed his screen.
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
I had more trouble with those damn owlkins, there were only a few spawns and I needed 15.
---
WIM
---
it shows every whisper in it own window and displays class, level, guild, race etc. and has buttons for invite and and shuch next to it. Love it.
---
According to the server stats my server is like 75% horde. 
---
I'm just one warlock please don't make me do this.
---
Are you stupid or willingly pretending people didn't use addons in vanilla?
---
It makes me cry when I think of the 100 Arcanite bars Thunderfury takes... at least I have until phase 3, but with Blizzards accelerated release schedule,  that might not be as long as I thought...
---
Yeah, but even with DME jump runs, there's just fewer arcane crystals. I don't bother farming them in the open in any case, like many other things, as I can't be fighting 1v3 constantly.
---
Aren't you supposed to be playing Fortnite or be doing homework or something?
---
Helps to sprint away before using vanish
---
Yeah, my raid group downed Rag for the first time last night. Was a great experience for us all, and while we may be a bit behind other guilds, it still felt good.
---
Thats probably a gryphon from a fly path.
---
Then they should‚Äôve listened to the community and released more than 5 servers.
---
This is their fault, not the playerbase.
---
I prefer the rod for int and stamina. 11 spellpower vs 1% crit is about the same I'd say.
---
I'd ask to see proof of that because it's completely illogical. There should be no conditions where that happens.
---
Second monitor and you can play with yourself whatever class you want.
---
So crazy. I also won the agility cloak and we got priest pants. Other item was the weird mail helm that's for shamans. Ended up going offspec to a hunter for fire res set.
---
Warriors: Make Mortal Strike debuff low priority instead of high priority on raid targets.
---
Warlocks: Give pets AOE damage reduction.

12th- layering removes

14th- honor system and world bosses
---
was just talking about this addon with some guildies the other day. as a hunter, it completely removes the jump i have on people via tracking. it takes a lot of skill out of the game and removes a crucial key from my kit. everyone just whips around towards me before i even see them on my map. 
---
i absolutely hate this addon and agree that it should be removed.
---
If you played 3 hours every single day between release and now at an average levelling pace you still wouldnt have hit 60 yet. 3 hours a day on average isn't THAT casual tbf.
---
Distract, Vanish, Preparation, tons of CC to mine nodes with mins nearby
---
There might not be, or maybe that is the wrong word or phrase, I just sort of assumed there was, considering there being warnings that there would be more players on Classic servers that there were in original, Vanilla WoW (meaning they could support more players per realm which = higher 'cap'). 
---
If they lowered the amount of people that can be logged into a realm at a time, wouldn't that fix problems from stuffing too many players into one server at a time? Or is it more complicated than that?
---
They should not reduce spawn time. And if they do, then not on all servers. They are already easy to farm on low/medium servers. I could see it become a thing on current layered servers, but for sure not on non player servers
---
It's been pretty watered down from my understanding
---
Playing dps warrior in random dungeons are selfish as fuck. There‚Äôs loads of rogues, shamans and hunters to fill that slot. They can‚Äôt tank, but you can. You just waste space for everyone else.
---
Get your dps gear as tank. The group will be get going faster and you can gear faster. And other warriors will stop looking down on you for being such a noob.
---
!remindme 6 months
---
Naw.
---
Wait for some like you lol
---
Literally the only one.
---
The raidlog has to be uploaded to warcraftlogs. Maybe people don't bother with that in pugs
---
Yes, different time zones do exist, thank you so much. 
---
However, from what I read, honor was originally intended to be released on the 12th (whichever time zone it would start in I do not recall) but this was pushed forward to the 14th. Layers will be removed on the 12th, whereas honor will lag behind for another 2 days. 
---
Regardless of how you look at it, there's a delay and no honor being introduced within the upcoming 24 hours.
---
Horde will enjoy 3h BG queues even with crossrealm BGs.
---
It‚Äôs not a race imo I would rather have fun playing than be redundant aha
---
My server doesn't even show on 2-weeks, ooof.  It does for ALl-time.  That said, it is very balanced, 51/49.  So that's cool.
---
Well all the WPVP he experienced seems to be the frustration of rogues ganking him when he was leveling. 
---
Taking that into account, you can see the general "notion" in this thread about which class is OP/easy in certain aspecsts.
---
So this was asked many Times before probably, but I have to ask it here, because it isnt clear for me. I'm leveling an enh Shaman and am currently lvl 30. Until now I used 1h + shield. I want to use WF because of the fun it brings to me (Yeah I know RB is better in General). So my question is what weapon I should use. I want to be a DPS so I kinda feel dumb to go in a dungeon with a 1h and shield. But for questing I feel like it's nice to have that shield, because I often need to Deal with more than one mob. So is it okay to do a dungeon with 1h and shield or should I switch there to a 2h? Is a 2H better for leveling because of the killspeed, so I dont have to take as many Hits? Please help meüòÖ
---
Easy to determine by looking up prices for different leathers and ores/herbs on AH, but most likely swapping it away will be beneficial.
---
They already reduced spawn rates for lotuses too
---
Mages are the biggest assholes.
---
As an UD Rogue, I'm unashamed to say I'm a jerk. I stalk people and gank them at their most vulnerable. I will blow every single cooldown to keep them permanently stunned or disoriented so they can't fight back.
---
But at least I'm a helpful person to MY side.
---
Every single toxic interaction I've had with other Horde players have ALL been mages. Getting toxic whispers because I tagged a mob first, AoE grinding mobs peoppe need for quests, and responding "lol git gud noob" when asked to help with elite group quests.
---
Not saying all mages are assholes, but the biggest assholes are still all mages.
---
Conversely, warriors are usually the nicest. I've been saved countless times by a random warrior just charging in out of nowhere.
---
&lt;3 melee bros
---
140g on Arugal now for flasks, Black lotus just spiked to 140g too.
---
I can be wrong but I think that Venruki is using a WA.
---
They fucked up by not having enough servers before launch, but there are enough servers now. I moved servers twice during launch week, deleting my first two choices. The server I'm on is healthy with no queues and has not been on any transfer list, source or destination. Stop containing about queues and crowded areas, you're all like crazed sheep in a crowded pen with the damn gate open.
---
Warlocks in classic have no real "rotation" in endgame content beside spamming shadow bolt with the occasional raid-curse or corruption.
---
hm alright, cheers, i got one more potential for you !

---
thoughts?
---
Not sure how you read "enemy faction" in this context and interpret that as "dungeon bosses"? We are in fact talking about player characters of the enemy faction.
---
God damn you just keep shoving that foot deep in your mouth huh?
---
Warrior for sure. Paladins have 4 abilities when tanking: Holy Shield, Judgment, Seal (whichever you pick), and consecration.
---
Vs Warriors who have several abilities, different stances, very different gameplay depending on your spec, its all good. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love paladins. I mained one from Vanilla through Cata (when I quit). But warriors are just so much fun.
---
Yeah, it hasn't really. Game is the same; and that's why it is good. If you expect some kind of change in PvP meaning you'll have 10 people farming day and nights Warsong Gulch for several months and refusing SPs, you're in the wrong. It can always happen anecdotally, but that won't ever be an actual trend for the 99.99% of players, including people playing in premade groups.
---
I think it was due to the 1 after the A.
---
Download AUX, it scans the AH and tells the average price of the items + the average price over the last month or so.
---
I kind of understand what you're trying to do. 
---
But sadly in classic (Especially early on when you do not have OP epic gear) the concept of "Get a little bit good from everything" turns into "Get a little bit of everything and suck at everything". 
---
I am not telling you that it is not going to work at all, because everything works in PvP, even 0 talent points can do the job. But you'd better be off specializing deeply in one of the talent trees.
---
Be nearby.
---
&gt; Spy detects players by nameplate (short range) or by actions (spell casts) at distance. If you are a 40 man raid outside nameplate distance, you can move around on foot or mounted without Spy detecting you.
---
RIP Warlocks (at least if they need to mount for some reason). 
---
&gt; You can detect them without spy by enabling spell casts for all players in the combat log and looking at it.
---
Aye it's possible, but how much easier is it to have the addon do things for you? 
---
&gt; If you look at PvP videos from vanilla wpvpers like Radagast - Harnessing Shadows 1 and 2, you will see he mostly plays with combat log open.
---
And that's part of what differentiates a *good* PvP'er from a *great* PvP'er. Having an addon do it all for you (and even play warning sounds, allow ease of targeting etc.) severely lessens the skillcap of world-PvP in my opinion. 
---
&gt; The only thing Spy actually facilitates is listing the player classes and allowing click targeting.
---
So, you are exactly as effective/focused when you have to check for such things in your combat compared to when you allow the addon to do it for you? It doesn't make it any easier beyond those 2 things you listed? You must be some sort of multi-tasking god to be able to 1v2 enemy players whilst still being informed of what other groups are doing (while your combatlog is spammed from the combat you are in).
---
Ya idk why they wouldnt faction restrict the transfers.
---
Pin this back üò°
---
Oh God... We've had 1 drop... for our guild.
---
I cannot imagine the horror.
---
"They killed our flight master!"
---
"You bastards!"
---
What is the yellow beam I keep seeing?
---
I've seen streamers use it, but not sure if I've ever encountered anyone using it on my server. I don't recall anyone ever targeting me through my stealth unless they were human.
---
Just knowing a rogue is there doesn't help a *ton*.
---
5% drop chance is 5% drop chance, regardless of how many times you run it you have a 5% chance.
---
And Eastern Plaguelands
---
BG will be crossrealm tho
---
I was mistaken, sorry to mislead.
---
Not exclusively- it calls out who gets important debuffs etc.
---
You mostly run in wpvp too.  You win everything through attrition as a druid really.
---
How all horde communicate.
---
I believe you can still ticket it. I had mislooted stuff moved by GMs back in TBC and WotLK. Gotta make that ticket immediately tho.
---
Same with the wolves in a quest of western plaguelands. There's only 1 wolf in the entire map and you have to kill 8
---
Thank you.
---
I understand were people are comming from. There are probably players out there that would like addons like Deadly Boss Mod or Threat-meters removed, since it removes player-skill from PvE content.
---
I like using addons, to some extent. But I'd really love if there where a version that was 100% not addon-able. It would make the game feel very fair, information-wise.
---
Holy shock!  I need to get WIN!
---
ü§£
---
sad :( i already had plans,
---
but thanks for correcting me
---
I'm fairly sure 99% of the people using Spy couldn't be as efficient just by reading combat log because it requires attention and skill.
---
but thanks for the information
---
pvp is the endgame of wow, so you Think wow is garbage?
---
It‚Äôs actually insane the amount of mental gymnastics people on this subreddit will do to reassure themselves.
---
I play on Herod and honestly I wish I rolled on Faerlina, looks way more fun than the garbage server that this is, I even have a toon on Whitemane and it‚Äôs boring over there too.
---
I hope Blizzard opens up paid character transfers cause I‚Äôd pay $100+ to move to Faerlina.
---
I think that's what they tried which is why there were so high queues at launch. I don't actually know too much about this myself so all I can do is guess. I don't think blizzard wants to actually lock servers because people want to play with friends/alts and it just sounds like too many people want to play on Faerlina no matter what and they are going to sit in the que even if it takes them 2 hours to play.
---
Experience, luck, or Google.
---
Whatever you want really
---
Or the unogoro dinosaur bones, looks like 80% of the dinosaurs are boneless

Serves you right for being such a big boi.
---
How bout heal in dungeons
---
I haven't ever played a paladin, but the lack of a taunt and the fact that it's dependent on mana seems... iffy.
---
I don't understand the anti-Spy circlejerk, I've used my combat log to track when the enemy faction is around for years. Spy does not detect anything that is not present in the combat log unless you mouse over a player; the only advantage Spy gives over no addons is 1) you can target someone if they are within range of doing so (which you can do with a /tar command anyway) and 2) it shows the *minimum* level that player can be until they are within visible range for their level to actually detected (for example, if your combat log picks up a Hunter using AotP, Spy will say that Hunter's level is "40+").
---
I keep seeing it is "stealth tracking", but that's simply not true. You get a notification when the combat log reads someone stealths/prowls ... but guess what, the vanilla combat log also shows that someone is stealthed.
---
None of this is game-breaking or new in any fashion. Is it only a problem now because more people have cottoned on?
---
I laughed to hard since the first pack if the video :D They mark skull on the earth ellies that should be banished and the banish comes when the skull is 50% hp :D
---
Anyone know what add-ons he has?  Maybe his twitch profile shows (will have to check later).  I am curious about tracking enemy cooldowns
---
The week I would have finished was the BC pre patch IIRC. I didnt even care at that point. Just glad it was over.
---
But they gave people a day to move ahead of everyone who wasn't already on the server, this preserving the name reservation to the new server.
---
The problem there was it wasn't long enough, just a day. And it needs to be standard practice for new servers that are used to alleviate full ones, not just a one time thing.
---
Yea, that's my point. It's not just the combat-log that is being read by this addon, which makes the whole "combat-log"-argument not realistic. Which seems what /u/Motrenon was trying to claim.
---
180?  Cuz 360 is a full circle ü§£
---
Technically, before if you could sneak in one warlock and two others (like rogues/druid) into IF, you could summon a whole raid from some random house in there, if no one went in there, no one would know.  
---
Now with Spy, you just have to get close to get a warning that multiple horde are there and the whole thing is ruined.
---
Love this &lt;3
---
Any idea of how balanced factions are? I have this internal struggle of not wanting to make it worse on my own server by leaving (Bigglesworth) but man let me tell ya questing in STV is actually impossible.
---
For every 1 alliance I see there is 6-7 horde. And at least half of those horde wait till your 10% hp killing 3 mobs and then kill you...or 4 of them will just flat out kill you.
---
I pre cast it when i know big dmg is coming. Kinda hard to heal with it after the fact.
---
No, because a mass exodus of players will inevitably happen, and when it does, your server will definitely die wayyyyyy before any of the full ones.
---
Was that on Netgergate Keep last night?
---
name of the character panel addon?
---
Ah, the old Barbara Streisand
---
Hello! We are Blood Inc and We're currently recruiting.
---
We are an Alliance guild first established in 2005 and are now operating on Mirage Raceway (EU PvE).
---
We have settled nicely into our new home and are clearing all current content:
---
Molten Core 10/10 and Onyxia 1/1
---
We desire to finish filling our ranks with active and dedicated raiders that have aspirations to see through all phases. Our vision is to have a tight knit group that raid together with little to no rotation of personnel, all geared up and ready for phase 3 and BWL.
---
We are made up of experienced players that have played Vanilla in the past but are open to everyone as long as you have a mature attitude, a desire to have fun and able to get on with your guild mates. Ideally you would be online most evenings and have a desire to raid 2-3 times a week.
---
The Schedule:
---
Molten Core : Wed 2100 - 0000
---
Onyxia : Days determined by resets 2100 - Finish
---
Will we distribute loot using a need or greed roll system with the aid of class priority lists. More details can be found on our Discord.
---
We are currently looking for 2 each of:
---
Holy Paladins
---
Resto Druids
---
DPS Warriors
---
Ultimately Blood Inc is all about the fun, the ride and the respect for our fellow gamers. If this is something that resonates with you then please consider membership with us.
---
If you're interested you can come to our Discord to have a look around and introduce yourself or alternatively you can message Togashi, Zeena or Beanstalk in game for a chat.
---
See you in server!
---
https://discord.gg/D6MfS8p
---
our plan playing alts in p2 is to just dungeon spam lol
---
That's the thing; I don't see it. By then we are at the end game.
---
I don't have this addon but since it exists, not using it puts me at a disadvantage so I understand why people use it. I don't see how this can be solved.
---
Now, I'm no statistician, so feel free to humiliate my math here, but if it's a 5% drop (so 0.05 chance), then the probability of not seeing it after 38 runs would be 0.95\^38 or 14.24%. That's not low at all. In fact, I doubt you're even out of the bell curve yet.
---
What's awful is a thread I saw a couple weeks ago where a guy had ran Arena over 670 times to get his Savage Gladiator Chest. The chances of that are (5/6 chance of NOT seeing Gorosh, 92% chance his drop is NOT the chest) (0.833\*.92)\^670 or 4.8574x10\^-78. Or basically, he was the outlier at the far end of the graph that you typically drop because its not really representative of the data.
---
Cry more rogueboi:D you can do the same with just the normal combat log. If it makes you feel useless that's 100% a YOU problem. Git gud
---
&gt; Stealth for world PvP IS a massive advantage
---
Stopped reading here.  If stealth was such a massive advantage they wouldn't literally require rogues to get the opener in every duel.
---
I think most people who play Alliance don't do so for the cities or the quest design, or to have a harder or easier experience, but rather to a void players like you.
---
&gt; This still works fine, Spy just reads the combat log.
---
&gt; Like players can also do.
---
My problem with the addon isn't that it does something that's impossible to do manually, but rather that the automation that happens effectively lowers the skillcap for World-PvP. Sure, if you are prancing around willy-nilly minding your own business and relaxing it's perfectly viable to keep yourself up-to-date with everything going on in the Combat Log manually. But if you are currently fighting 1v2 it's going to be a heck of a lot harder to keep track of everything going on around you (also caused by your combat log being spammed by the actions in the combat you are currently in). Spy simplifies that, allowing you to not divert any attention towards reading the combat log because you get all the information you need spoonfed into your HuD.
---
Former Herod player now in Earthfury, our server indeed is deader than dead, so i ask you nicely to stay in your shitshow server. We dont need your kind of people in here and very much like our healthy population and almost 50/50 Ally / Horde ratio.
---
Too much editing
---
Try using ethernet for a day or two and see if it solves the problem. Wifi can be pretty unrealiable for gaming.
---
Don‚Äôt just stare at it; EAT IT.
---
Try sexymap. Clear the animation and turn it to a square.
---
&gt; EASIEST
---
This is so ignorant it's clear you've never actually played rogue in vanilla.  Spy literally removes the element of surprise and makes you more likely to get hit or seen out of stealth.
---
Tbh I've not seen an AH addon actually default a bid price that isn't also the buyout price, I think it's people WITHOUT AddOns that do this. Or at least, somehow making them worse than they are whilst default.
---
can you not do this with a macro?
---
Lmao, it took me around 15 days of /played to get to 60. 7 days is nothing.
---
And you think this is a good supportive argument why Spy is fine? You are perfectly OK with such an addon severely dumbing down the game and lessening the skillgap in world-PvP? Because that's exactly what's happening to people using the addon.
---
Saying they're all unfair isn't unreasonable. For example, seeing cast bars and debuff durations is a pretty significant advantage over someone who's playing the game vanilla.
---
Depending on context. 
---
I had this mage who didn't get that blink then casting a frost spell wasn't wise. Because that means I'm going to interrupt his frost school (no iceblock) with charge and immediately shred twice. I believe you should shapeshift in bear when it's relevant to either close the gap, root with feral charge, interrupt a spell or use frenzied regen.
---
It happens from both sides, lol. Was especially noticable in the beginning when everyone was leveling.  
---
People didn't want to 1v1 or 2v2, but as soon as they had numbers advantage, they jumped you.  
---
I think one reason is that if one guy calls for the pvp, everyone else will join in, even if they would normally let you move along.
---
Looks more conventional, but still wonder if 21 in Ele is worth it over SS from Enh - not sure. If you shock on CD you get one chance every 6 sec to make use of it, whereas if you SS you get a chance to proc WF (?) and 2 sources of +20% nature damage - but unless fighting low mobility casters, chances are you won't be Earthshocking every time. 
---
Tough call.
---
What a great answer, thank you so much!
---
Could also be Elite Player Frames for the Dragon.
---
What it always was.  Blizz saying they would limit it was PR to respond to being annoyed by the result of streamers using the controversy as a click cow
---
Oh god yes please blizzard make a stance on this
---
When already stealthed, I think I only triggers other peoples Spy addon if I use a skill like poisons or distract. And since I am nearly always stealthed (sub spec) except when fighting, you'll prob get the warning right as the ambush hits.
---
yeah that's a big fucking difference though lol
---
I'm stuck at 49, human rogue very little quests available, not having fun tbh. hopping between classic and retail and I feel like quitting both till SL, maybe rolling a horde alt may help I dunno
---
And, NOCHANGES
---
HoJ dropped on my fourth run. But I'm a priest lol
---
I ront think you understand what a joke is
---
Prot paladin is the most fun, but least viable imo. If you can hold agro, you‚Äôre going to do the most damage out of any tank by a long shot.
---
You can do Mara &amp; DM East solo grinding. Hydramist has some good videos/guides
---
I use dagger/off hand.
---
it must sucks to hear that but the game is not and never was designed for casuals
---
Seeing a melee dagger on a priest makes me want to smash faces in another way.
---
I never played alliance, but for undead the circle doesn't appear anywhere it's right there the whole time
---
The only realistic fix for this would be to reduce the combat log radius. And only for actions/entries for hostile players.
---
&gt;	They have always existed.
---
This has not always existed lmao
---
I have a 60 Warrior and Warlock, and I play Warlock on retail. The short answer, is play both to level 25ish, it's not a huge commitment.  Make a warlock first, and get some green weapons/armor for your warrior, it helps them IMMENSELY as it levels.  You warlock can do 1-60 in greens.
---
Warriors are the best class in classic.  Their rotation is interesting, fun, and powerful, and they have a wide variety of special abilities and cooldowns. They are the top dps class, and the only universally viable tank. Also one of the most powerful pvp classes.    If you tank, you will easily get into any DUNGEON group you want, as every group struggles to find a tank.
---
The problem with warriors is that they are also the most popular class. Dps warriors share gear with paladins, hunters, rogues, tanks, and other dps warriors.  You will struggle somewhat to find groups, as most either need a tank, or the tank or their rogue friend doesn't want you taking their gear.   They are also super gear dependent, and even then it's a struggle to level them. it's gonna be very hard to find a raid spot, every raid already has 2-4 prot warriors as tanks, and they have little interest in having you come in and take their tank gear. Dps warriors have a spot, but you wont get set gear, and the drops for dps are very limited in MC outside of weapons.
---
Bottom Line with Warriors.  Level as Arms, and learn to tank.  It's super fun and if you can tank you will never want for a group. Also take herbs/alchemy as the health potions you make are invalueable.
---
Warlocks are an amazing dps class. In a sea of mages, you might be the ONLY warlock in a 40 person raid.  In two weeks i'e gotten a T2 helm, and 2pc Tier 1. I fully expect this week to get a 3rd or 4th piece of tier gear from MC.  In dungeons they do great damage, and have fantastic utility with curses, felhunter purges, some aoe, and high single target damage.   You also barely run out of mana as long as a healer keeps healing you.  Plus they are decently easy to level and are not very gear dependent.  Your SS, healthstone, and summons are just bonuses on top of the huge utility you bring to any group. You also have fear, which is the only CC in the game that also lets you do damage to the CC'd mob.  
---
The warlocks also have downsides. Your demons  mostly suck outside of soloing.  the Voidwalker cant tank at all, even fully spec'd into demo. In fact that outside of Soul LInk PvP, demo is a really useless tree. The only really good talent requires you to sac your pet, which makes most of the points you spent getting to that talent pointless. The only good leveling spec is drain tank, where you get 5/5 fel concentration, use a succubus, dot the enemy and wand/drainlife until the mob is dead.    The absolute worst part, is that after spending 60 levels getting to your first raid, you suddenly stop using 95% of your spells and abilities and instead apply a single curse and then shadowbolt until the boss is dead, and maybe if you are lucky you banish a mob. 
---
Bottom line with Warlocks.  They are awesome, i highly recommend you level one despite it's issues. It's easy as hell to get groups and gear up.  Level as drain tank affliction (Dot and Wand to around 36, then Dot and Drainlife from 36-60) At level 60 respec to SM/Ruin and start raiding.   If it's your first character take herb/alchemy.  Otherwise take Skinning/Tailoring.
---
Out of 4x runs it dropped once yesterday
---
It does the opposite lol, i still get the jump on people and they usually waste spells trying to find me. I use it to track ganks, its great for rogues. It should be removed tho imo.
---
Turns out you were right.
---
Looks like the general consensus is 20s-1g.
---
How can you call spamming LfG or world channel work? Or a challenge? Seriously?
---
So, rogues can‚Äôt jump absent minded or beginners anymore and have to actually start playing their class for a change? Seriously, this is what you are complaining about?
---
On my server it's about the same
---
Swamp of sorrows jaguars are 1.2
---
yea, the 1 and not enough A's imo
---
Charge Skull &gt; 1 MH swing will give 20-23 rage total &gt; Thunderclap &gt; Immediate Defensive Stance &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Demo Shout
---
Pretty much every engagement that you can safely charge without pulling adds. If Bloodrage is on CD, 1-2 MH/OH autos will suffice.
---
What if I can‚Äôt charge safely? Bow pull &gt; Berserker &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Berserker‚Äôs Rage &gt; Intercept Skull &gt; Demo Shout (if more than 4 mobs) &gt; Whirlwind (if they hopefully crit you during engagement) or swap to defensive &amp; start sundering each individual target.
---
Either way, Demo Shout is going to be your best friend during engagements. Also, popping Bloodrage near mobs creates threat on its own. Combining Bloodrage + Demo Shout + Thunderclap gives you PLENTY of time to start tab-sundering
---
When you first tame a pet they are already in "unhappy" status. Whenever a pet is unhappy you have max a couple hours to fix it before they run away, even if you're offline.
---
Its not bad for economy. Prices will set to a new equilibrium. Materials will be higher, but thats how it should have been.
---
Farmable material‚Äôs market with layering has suffered an artificial supply excess.
---
Yeah and you see people behind walls ,and pretty far away something you will miss 90% of times without it
---
Way off there's 10 spawn in these 4 zones at 1 hrs cooldown that's 24*10*4. That would be 960 per day if they are picked instantly everytime.
---
In addition it is the only ‚Äûeasy to get‚Äú gear because holy pallies don‚Äôt want it and you don‚Äòt have to fight over the other pieces with a million warriors in the raid
---
Yep. But I guess he didn‚Äôt remembered me and would not have not I went for him
---
Late? I'm not even 60 yet.
---
Black lotus only spawns in one location in each of those zones at a time.
---
&gt; How did LfG made raiding easier?
---
Where did the person claim it made raiding easier? Why are you trying to twist what he/she wrote into something that wasn't? 
---
&gt; Same with this spy addon, u either use it or start scanning the combat log, outcome is the same
---
Really? You act like it's trivial to obtain and use the information Spy gives you from the combat log itself.  
---
My problem with the addon isn't that it does something that's impossible to do manually, but rather that the automation that happens effectively lowers the skillcap for World-PvP. Sure, if you are prancing around willy-nilly minding your own business and relaxing it's perfectly viable to keep yourself up-to-date with everything going on in the Combat Log manually. But if you are currently fighting 1v2 it's going to be a heck of a lot harder to keep track of everything going on around you (also caused by your combat log being spammed by the actions in the combat you are currently in). 
---
Spy simplifies that, allowing you to not divert any attention towards reading the combat log because you get all the information you need spoonfed into your HuD.
---
can you tell me more about your stat priorities? Obviously Stam, but are you avoiding leather and cloth for damage mitigation too?
---
dont worry blizzard will simply halve the user capacity,wich means big ques
---
Why? So they can roll on the gear that you‚Äôve been farming? You respect a guy who won‚Äôt take an extra minute to find out stat priorities or read tooltips.
---
Very weird example.. Do you bring your own scissors and styling products when you go to the hairstylist and expect to get the work for free?
---
Yeah, that 500+ man guild of yours is surely the best and only place to find friends. Definitely. It#s not just a sea of nameless dudes who are basically just your own private LFG pool.
---
Also, wow, you're doing endgame content! Molten Core and Onyxia is definitely something you need 500+ man for, it's just too hard otherwise.
---
Pathetic. That's what you are.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22798/might-of-menethil ?
---
This makes me so happy, me and my group are all first time WoW players just nearing level 50 and we went and infiltrated the doors of Blackrock Mountain just to take a picture. I agree with this post, just have fun.
---
I'm going to get this addon right now
---
Yeah im sure every single negative interaction youve had is with mages. Let's be honest, there's only one reason to play rogue... Because you want to be an asshole. Which is fine, but own up to it.
---
I run full Fury raid spec with dual wield and mostly DPS gear, and a lot of healers have told me I'm very easy to heal. Not sure why exactly, though I do keep Demo shout and Thunderclap up when tanking larger groups, and for stuff like DM Tribute I mark for CC.
---
Done a few 3man Tributes in ~15-20 min each. Granted, I'm probably one of the best geared fury warriors on my server, so that definitely helps. 
---
If your gear is bad, do smaller pulls and have shield hotkeyed and be ready to switch quick if things get hairy. Also, grenades are amazing.
---
Same here. I feel like I HAVE to use it, which I think no addon should make feel.
---
I don't know what kind of power Blizzard has when it comes to limit addons and I don't really know how addons work either. Maybe some limit on how you can target players through an addon? Or some sort of line-of-sight restriction... but I don't know, feels like a lot of addons would suffer either way. Unless they can ban specific addons.
---
It is 2019 you have to consider elementsls who do not identify themselves as male or female.
---
you could only make 3 chars total over all servers
---
I reserved 3 names on 3 different servers,and ended up starting on another realm losing my name
---
I just hit 60 on my paladin yesterday, can confirm.
---
It can be but people tend to make it more interesting by ignoring threat or overpulling.
---
Must be a very dead server then, either that or its potions or elixirs you are thinking of.
---
So if you do the math it is pretty much impossible for every 40-man raiding team on the server to be completely flasked out every time.
---
I'd recommand; Prat 3.0. 
---
I've never tried WIM so I can't tell if its better.
---
a couple of EU servers are bigger then Faerlina,and there are no big influencers there
---
You have to cast the shock immediately as the lightning finishes.
---
Same with the building by the fp in duskwood
---
Who down voted that haha 1k is alot too me okay
---
Well.. Until you get whispered by Bliz0rd telling you about how your account is compromised or /w about gold sites.
---
I have major FOMO about not being fast enough to keep up with blizzards phase release schedule
---
&gt; this addon just makes it easier.
---
"Just"? You are perfectly OK with such an addon severely dumbing down the game and lessening the skillgap in world-PvP? Because that's exactly what's happening with the addon, it simply makes World-PvP much easier to handle. 
---
&gt; if you think spy is unfair then you probably shouldn‚Äôt use any addons because they‚Äôre all unfair.
---
I don't personally think it's unfair, I just find it disheartening that an addon that lessens the skillgap in world-PvP is seen as something like the second coming of Jesus to many people, when, in fact, all it does is make the game easier.
---
It feels like low level Un‚Äôgoro once you grab
---
As a skinner, its upsets me greatly having to do things like "get 4 crocolisk skins" and them not dropping. AND THEN I LITERALLY SKIN THE THING BUT DONT GET ITS SKINS?!
---
Cheers mate
---
I mean spirit's not really good for all classes.  You don't regen hp in combat, I guess it may give you an extra 5 hp between mobs when leveling.
---
as long as they don't restrict the API the addon uses to do what it does I think there's no use in banning the addon since someone else can just make a new one.
---
I could be mistaken of course.
---
The dumbasses who argue that "the addon only provides info readily available in your combat log" really piss me off. It is technically true, but still such a weak argument. The problem with it is how it does it in an inhumane way. It's like a slowmo camera that "technically only shows you what you already see, you could just focus more and see it all for yourself".
---
Nani?!
---
He potted *again* dood?
---
&gt;Triple poly's, eats, drinks and swaps ten trinkets.
---
You can't do that automatically. But you can add glowing soulstone etc. icon when your spell is available or whatever else you want. Weakauras addon has gigantic options.
---
Looks like this.

---
3 to 10 times the server population IS A chAnGE.
---
The greatest threat to the health of classic is how much a flask is going to cost when people start using them.    Players are not going to spend 4k a week raiding
---
Yeah there are weirder things online but that doesn't mean that this aint weird
---
addon that let's you team up with players for instances = NO HELL NO THIS IS ANTI CLASSIC!!
---
addon that let's you see all enemies around you even if you haven't spotted them + stealthed players = yes this is fine its pure classic in my eyes
---
Want to try this but don't know if I can bother with macro timing, does the talent on its own make it a better tree than ret? Also defense skill reduces crits so try to avoid that stat?
---
I used Hypnotic Blade in Vanilla, and for years after, I was laughing at myself for being stupid. Then in Classic, I realised that it was actually a dps increase for me, so I picked it up again, and kept it for a few levels.
---
That's why I had to kill spiders to make wolves spawn in WPL?
---
Oh ok, so nothing is actually gonna disappear it's just gonna be harder to get into those instances with 40 people?
---
People use their galaxy phones with comic sans font. Do you think magenta text will stop them? :D
---
No it's not. Give me your social security number and I'll tell you why.
---
GrobMob is best Mob
---
Tanking dungeons will be your best bet.
---
You're perfectly fine for early brd. You can help people with Ony atunement jailbreak quests, arena farm, possibly even making their key depending on fineous darkvines level.   Maybe one or two more sunken temple runs to hit 53 if u want that head start, then into brd. 
---
 If you've got a grp of friends or guild to run with you can push farther.   I tanked everything low lvl and up to and killed angerforge when i was 53, then a full clear at 54 with guild grps.   Last boss needed our "ret" pally to heal as well as our holy pally cuz we kept princess alive and boss mobs were 5 lvls higher than me.
---
Blizzard will never ask for your info. 100%scam
---
LOOK AT THE BONES!!!!
---
It kind of makes sense If I understand what you mean. You can see someone IRL from much farther away than you can "track" them.
---
Seeing as there aren't any dead servers I don't think that's the case.
---
Absolutely not you should give him your info it's safe.
---
Yeah someone told me that if you pull without your pet dealing damage it solves the problem.  This seems to be the key factor with the aggro behavior.  Wish I had known about that beforehand but I didn't have 5pc until this last weekend so unfortunately couldn't test myself :)

Thanks! i went to the site and its said "login with Fackbook" so i was skeptical. i did not put in any info.
---
Haven't PvP'd much yet, but I whiff come off cold all the time in PvE. I'm used to being able to jump/turn/insta cast it, but it is almost always delayed and I miss. I guess it's from the spell batching?
---
As a pally I can‚Äôt get my cleanse mouse over macro to work on raid frames. It does however work if I hover my mouse over the character. Is there no way to make this work?

I recently got stuck in that chimney! As a dwarf I couldn‚Äôt exit the fireplace, but a gnome could walk right in and out. We eventually dueled, and I got unstuck by being feared.

3k was only the biggest servers. Most were capped at 2K / 2K5
---
The Venn Diagram of people who support the US military  bombing civilians and the Chinese police killing protesters is basically a circle at this point.

There were addons doing the exact same thing as spy is doing right now.

Also, "we had in classic?"

[NA EST Mankick - PVE Horde]
---
Do you level slower than molasses flowing uphill in Winterspring? Do you have more alts than you could possibly have time? Do you have an odd fascination with cheese? Are you for the horde?! If so, &lt;Mediocrity in Motion&gt; is the guild for you! 
---
We are a casual guild that started on Skywall in May 2005.  We are looking for people of all classes who want to level a billion alts, run dungeons, PVP, and maybe raid when we get to that point. We group on Friday/Saturday at 9PM server but the start time is subject to change. We will accept all levels, but our most active players are between 30-50 in level. Our rules are to have fun, help each other, and love cheese.
---
Message me through Discord or PST Gorgonzola, Spenna, Druscella, or Headcheese in-game for invite.
---
Blizzard GM massages has blue Blizz icon next to them. You can't miss it.
---
Yea I play about once a year just to scratch the itch. It‚Äôs fun but at this point it‚Äôs just nostalgia since I know I‚Äôm not gonna spend the time getting to 50 and getting geared.
---
You should have been sceptical when the whisper came from a lvl1 char names 'Blizzards'...
---
Currently planning on moving to from Firemaw to Earthshaker with a large part of my guild. Looking forward to get away from queue hell and over-inflated economy
---
Either you:
---
- impeach people to create a toon on a server ‚Äî&gt; massive whine that you can‚Äôt join your friends
---
- limit the number of people that can connect at the same time ‚Äî&gt; massive whine that you have queue on a server, like we had in fact...
---
- recommend not to create a toon on a full pop server, propose free transfers regularly‚Äî&gt; massive whine that it‚Äôs impossible to do 40 vs 40 pvp, in BRM, the most laggy and overcrowded zone of wow.
---
Whatever you do, you lose and I honestly think they chose the best solution in this scenario. Phase 3 is going to solve lots of things
---
Don't be an ass when OP is asking a serious question and doesn't know; not even for sarcastic or humorous effect.
---
It was called world of rogue craft
---
What do you mean by split threat?
---
It's a combination of both, because I used to always pull with pet attack and never had an issue, but when I pulled the same way when I got 5pc it was the first time it ever linked their aggro.  So it seems you just have to body pull with pet rather than attack pull to solve the problem.  Without 5pc though I never once had linked aggro no matter how I pulled.  It's good to know the distinction, either way body pulling is the safe bet though.
---
Yea exactly.
---
The talent points for improved stealth are actually worthwhile if you want to be less seen.
---
That's not how it works.
---
They would have to overhaul the internal workings of how the API presents it's information upon being called.
---
To accomplish what you're saying, they would have to split the combat log API into different event API's. They aren't going to do such a massive overhaul for one mod.
---
Also, what messages would have additional parameters? What does that even mean in this case? An 'onEvent' call to the API just calls the information from the whole API  " COMBAT\_LOG\_EVENT\_UNFILTERED". The parameters are input via the addon's LUA code AFTER the data is called, not before. The 'onEvent' call just pulls the whole thing, there is no such parameters for an API call.
---
Anyone who thinks this can be banned, or that it is somehow 'easily fixed' have no idea how the LUA system works within WoW.
---
Just got this yesterday !
---
***Trouble [EU-Horde-Razorgore]***  is a community-driven, progression-focused, English-speaking raiding guild. We‚Äôve been playing online games together for upwards of 15 years, and we‚Äôve picked up a whole bunch of great players and good friends along the way. We have a wide array of players from all across Europe, and beyond, with varying different levels of experience.
---
We have players who have reached high heights in both PvE and PvP across various expansions, but also others that have never even played vanilla WoW before. With this in mind, we are creating an inclusive guild where everyone is welcome, as long as they‚Äôre enthusiastic and willing to play with us to the best of their ability.
---
***Raiding***
---
We will be raiding two nights a week (all times are in  **Server Time (CET)** ):
---
**Tuesday 7:50-11:30 PM**
---
**Sunday 7:50-11:30 PM**
---
Come Phase 3 (BWL), an additional raid night will be added to revisit older raid tiers.
---
All participants are expected to bring their own consumables. You don‚Äôt have to be doing top tier DPS/HPS, but you do need to respect the rest of the guild enough to bring what you need to be functional in a raid.
---
***Loot System***
---
Our loot system is a very simple, closed bid DKP system with partial decay to help deter hoarding. Name a more iconic duo than loot council and drama.
---
When the third raid day is introduced in Phase 3 (BWL), it is worth noting that it will NOT use the DKP system, and all items will be rolled (main-spec priority, as usual) between raiders who want them. The reason for this is that a lot of people in the guild can only raid two days a week, tops, and they should not feel like they have to come to this raid in order to keep up on DKP for the main tier raids.
---
***Classes***
---
Like any other guild, we would prefer the dominant classes with meta specs. However, we do believe that the player comes above the class and spec in a lot of circumstances. If you‚Äôre dedicated, positive and willing to listen, those things go an exceptionally long way.
---
With that in mind, we are willing to give most people a shot, with the caveat that those classes and specs with a generally weak performance may find it harder to earn a permanent raid spot. If you are very confident in your ability to play an off-meta spec that isn‚Äôt listed below to an acceptable level, feel free to contact us:
---
**Druid**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Hunter**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Mage**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Priest**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Rogue**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Shaman**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Warlock**  -  **CLOSED**
---
**Warrior**  -  **Fury (DPS or Tank), Protection**
---
**Classes that are closed are still welcome to join, but you probably won‚Äôt be able to raid with us unless/until we have a huge turnover of people.**
---
***Contact***
---
We‚Äôd love to answer any questions you may have. The best way to contact us is by joining our Discord:
---
https://discord.gg/Wj2fMHP
---
You can also talk to an officer directly on Discord by adding an officer to your friends list:

**Jj, Strife, Alex, Cur, Gains**
---
Thanks for your time!
---
You mean mountain lions?
---
Paladins shine in groups if you expect to 1 v 1 as a paladin your in for a difficult time.
---
In a group you keep blessing of sacrifice up on a teammate because any competent group will cc the paladin for last and nothing‚Äôs more hilarious then watching the enemy team try to cc you as blessing of sacrifice keeps breaking you out. You use blessing of freedom on a warrior and watch as the warrior rampages through everything. You use BoP on a clothie so they won‚Äôt die.
---
You dispel your teammates because you have that ability too. 
---
And you heal because you can even as a ret paladin.
---
People will either farm more, or stop buying them. As with any other item in the game.
---
no most things will stay in game but there is no point in doing them, bwl gear almost makes mc obsolete (mc is a special case tho cause of the bindings) and when we're in AQ/Naxx/ZG no other raids will be raided and you won't find 40 people to go there
---
Definitely this is an issue. I just started being an offtank in raids 10 days ago, and it's already taken me down from 400G to 200G ... my epic mount is now a long forgotten dream, and i'm just an offtank on current "easy" molten core
---
Coarse, rough, irritating blood that gets everywhere
---
I dont think Blizzard refers to themselves as Blizzards
---
Oh no, rogues can't sneak up on people in wpvp?
---
Whatever will they do, rogues are so bad in pvp...
---
Damn... There's a filter option?? I'd love to stop seeing bobbing apples on my map
---
Heh, guess Escape Artist is useful after all

I'd hoped the music would be related to the cover picture  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF68tdawQoY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF68tdawQoY)
---
Earthfury is 53-47
---
&gt; What Spy does you can do with a properly set always shown combat log.
---
As others have stated, definite scam. Report that user.
---
Ah that's a bummer. Best get a shift on then.
---
Do you also get this upset when you read a guide and find out that you bought the wrong items earlier ?
---
You don't duel a druid. There isn't any reason to do it. Druids main attribute in pvpnis survivability.
---
I only used blizzard and frost nova from 28-50
---
10 is the number I've been using as a rule of thumb
---
It's the one with less. Probably 12 then. I never farm in Silithus :)
---
There is only 1-2 Hand ful of spawns per Zone that even spawns Black Lotus.
---
Each hour 4 Black lotuses spawn - distributed randomly among the 12 (or howmany it may be) spawns there are.
---
When you pick one, write down the time. One Hours later you can be sure at one of the 12 spawns there is a black Lotus again
---
I asked to talk about it on discord but you just ran away while still talking shit and now you're literally just repeating "you're projecting" every single reply.
---
Just stop, you're a joke. Stop typing.
---
Maybe blizzard could limit combat log information from enemy players? Idk
---
Wow is a videogame, where the primary reason to play it is to have fun. In WoW in particular there's this massive toxic playerbase that seems to have completely forgotten videogames are meant to be fun to play, who will flip out and end friendships over stuff like need rolls. I respect this man who wants no part in that world, and just wants to play a stabby priest. He is the ideal.
---
I also seriously doubt Stabby Priest will be doing much raiding when he hits 60, so it's not like you actually have to worry about him taking your precious BiS.
---
If the server dies in 1¬Ω years, then at least I've been able to actually play the game when I want to, instead of spending 1¬Ω year on a server with 2 hour queues every day
---
Why blacked? It sucks.
---
Of course it is, like someone mentioned earlier authentic blizzard employee have a blue/blizzard icon next to their name..
---
They wouldn't address those concerns in a whisper they would temporarily/permeantly ban the account if TOS is broken which would be sent an email and required you to call them
---
Because you are casting stealth when you exit the instance.
---
Only the last one for people who didn't have tier 10 gear. With ICC gear even the last one was faceroll.
---
It's a fun and very powerful PvP weapon,  and it's "good enough" to have you save DKP in BWL and get other items first. 
---
But it's also a great achievement. Like dude, you'll have one of the coolest weapons in classic and a legendary.
---
Been looking for something like this, Tyvm
---
Moonwalk.
---
Curious if mage trinket can break charm, because if you're full destro 1 shot build you can seduce --&gt; soulfire --&gt; shadowflame pretty much anyone to death iirc.
---
You mean like every other fucking player you attack from stealth? QQ
---
Nice video! I'm playing ele too and loving it, might do an ele/2h build.
---
I learned what invulnerable mail was from your last one, gonna take me ages to farm the mats
---
New player, no one who came from retail can be so "clueless"
---
I'll find it when I logon today. It's a few different weak auras that I edited and combined.
---
People will raid Mc/ony the other guy is being overly dramatic. There Will always be new players/alts who will want to raid Mc. Will it be as easy to get in a pug as it is now? No probably not
---
When you pre-plan groups, that kind of negates the whole ‚ÄúI get an invite as soon as I log on‚Äù. No shit you do, it‚Äôs fucking planned.
---
Many players don‚Äôt do this though. And even if they do, many dungeons take a lot of travel time to get to. So even if it‚Äôs planned, it can take a group a quarter hour, even half an hour, to get the whole group there. That‚Äôs a lot of time waiting/not being engaged.
---
Yeah, honestly, mages need to never complain when any melee sans maybe rogue pops absolutely everything to try and kill them, it's literally the only chance at victory.
---
?
---
Here is the problem in a nutshell: When you have a faction imbalance the majority (usually horde) only will consider transferring when there are too few alliance to kill.  That is their only pain point. This perception happens around a 80/20 ratio. The minority (usually alliance) will transfer as soon as they perceive any imbalance, which can be as little as 55/45, because they rightly fear it will become worse over time through transfers and folks quitting. Once this imbalance happens, with each transfer cycle, it will worsen, leading to eventual server death for any viable PVP for the majority faction, and for any viable grouping or social experience for the minority.  Alliance get an immediate benefit and have little to lose by transferring, and horde have little to gain and much to lose by transferring. The cycle is accelerated by all sides common awareness of this game theory dilemma.
---
With the Rhok, your pet pretty much will never hold aggro like it did again. Your DPS will be too high.
---
Huh? Did you write the article about millenials not being able to afford houses because of avocado toast, too?
---
I‚Äôm would grind ST from there go to BRD around lvl 55
---
you dont, why do you think druids dont fight each other
---
I play rogue, and I love this addon.
---
&gt; do you want us to have nothing to do and all quit?
---
We allready cleared and mc and there is still plenty to do
---
Fellow Bigglesworth player - at 372 kills and no luck :(
---
That sounds like mages with 1400hp.
---
Grenade doesn't block the school of magic, they can resume casting whenever they want. Literally at any given point of the duel the mage can sheep you and sit for 30 seconds drinking, eating, crafting mooncloth, etc.
---
i prefer this. people take huge screenshots as if im gonna zoom in.
---
When servers went from multiple layers down to 2, did anyone notice from an economy standpoint?  Almost no one did.
---
When the majority of servers were reduced to a single layer, did it kill off server economies?  Of course not.
---
This will be a complete nothing burger.
---
So it works like any addon in the game by simplifying stuff that is hard manually? If you think so maybe pledge for disabling all addons. Because that's literally all they do.
---
**&lt;Overrated&gt; US Kromcrush**
---
We are looking to recruit 2 rogues to join our raiding roster. We schedule raids on We maintain a single 40-man raid group and strive to foster a mature, fun community within our guild. In addition to our core raiding group, we have causal players (generally friends/family of raiders) that sometimes tag along. 
---
Our leadership consists of former competitive Vanilla raiders.
---

Raids
---
* Tuesday and Thursday starting at 8:00 pm EST. 
---
Classes:
---
*Rogue
---
Loot:
---
*Loot Council
---
People forget though, your character is only as good as the player. I've beaten some terrible 60 mages as a 58 holy priest. But generally I agree, also mages are a gold machine.
---
Indeed he is right. 1 Lotus per Zone in classic. This is not like on private servers ;)
---
Source? I harvest Lotuses :)
---
Fear, Polymorph and Slows. You have Ice Block for that.
---
Spy won't allow you to target a stealthed player unless you are close enough to detect them.  It does alert you they are in the area
---
Are Flasks really that necessary that even dps  must buy it in BWL/AQ phase?
---
I have no raid exp in vanilla content tho.
---
Enjoyed the cinematic opening a lot. Good job!
---
I did this three times this week. I won the princess ring, hand of Justice, and the tooth of eranikus. BELIEVE THE HYPE.
---
well if im near alot of people doing stuff like summoning and using spells / buffs ... my log would also light up like a christmas tree ... so also without spy I can see whats going on if I am near - its just the visualization
---
How do I set my class and faction btw in the heading of the post?
---
Jesus most of the time, 1g is worth more than what's in the lockbox.
---
It's still risky hedging your entire investment into Lotus. I sale every 4th one I get and reinvest it in other mats to capitalize on the current value being absurd for the amount of gold in circulation.
---
My problem with the addon isn't that it does something that's impossible to do manually, but rather that the automation that happens effectively lowers the skillcap for World-PvP. Sure, if you are prancing around willy-nilly minding your own business and relaxing it's perfectly viable to keep yourself up-to-date with everything going on in the Combat Log manually. 
---
But if you are currently fighting 1v2 it's going to be a heck of a lot harder to keep track of everything going on around you (also caused by your combat log being spammed by the actions in the combat you are currently in). Spy simplifies that, allowing you to not divert any attention towards reading the combat log because you get all the information you need spoonfed into your HuD.
---
As someone that has used the Combat Log extensively, simply hiding my combat log and allowing Spy to do all the compiling for me makes it trivial to stay oriented towards everything happening around me, even whilst fighting members of the other faction. Not that I couldn't do it before, but now it's just faceroll easy as it's spoonfed directly into my HuD.
---
What addons are you using? Specifically the timers on debuffs on you and the warning animations..
---
imagine bragging about winning Wpvp when you're a mage.  Lmao what a trash player.
---
Well yeah, but a player being terrible doesn't really speak to the class.
---
More than 30% downvoted lol. So much for people caring about muh classic game integrity. 
---
They removed the ability to set it so you can see enemy nameplates from far away, this addon is far worse.
---
But that goes againts the TOS, and is bannable
---
You get a good Mace and start wacking each other in caster form.
---
Mages charge because people get annoying about it and it takes a lot of time to make stacks.
---
Plus they compete with vendors.
---
Lockboxes often have kind of shitty loot too.
---
Even on layered servers, spawn rates have been about doubled per layer. When layers are gone, supply is going to boom as much as single layer servers atm. Right now prices are extremely speculative, like they always are when announcements are made in order to make a quick buck from the panic. And history so far has shown that's the worst time t buy. I'm waiting until things stabilize.
---
Dude what do you use? Is Crusader Calculated here?  
---
I'm getting to 200 g bills in 3 weeks, and that includes 6 repair bots , 30+g reparation bill
---
Buffood: 4s / Try (buy cheap meat @ah)
---
Black rumseys rum: 5s / Try
---
Elixir of (priestbuf, don't know the english word): 30 silver / try
---
Elixir of (+450 armor) - 50s / try
---
Elixir of (+agi  or mongoose) - 50s / 2g / try (thats why I stuck to agi)
---
Several healing pots (dm nord tribute runs, I always ask if I can have em)
---
Lots and lots of healthstones (tribute of our warlocks)
---
Also, consider wether your consumeables are NEEDED. No need to burn a +armor on geddon. If you just offtank a small add and there is no problem with you dieing, no need to use consumeables. You don't usually wipe becuase the offtank is taking too much damage / dieing.
---
They did?
---
What are you spending money on?  Even when I started raiding I didn't have too much besides food/drink buffs (which are cheap), greater stoneshields, mongoose(expensive) and brute force(less expensive after DM).  Have used juju and a few other misc. a few times but flask of titans is unnecessary at this point even if "undergeared".
---
If only there was software that let you crop your screenshots.  Maybe one day...
---
I am currently at 372 kills and have not yet seen it :(
---
I hadn't heard about flasks until halfway through aq40, and we were our servers top raiding guild at the time.
---
And everyone is geared way better this time around. So yeah, just don't flask until aq40 imo
---
Its just not needed.
---
i made a new char on noggenfogger and went to Thunder Bluff. Asked the first 60 i saw at the AH and asked for some silver for bags and learning weapon skill. He gave me 2g. Some people are so kind
---
Welcome to the suck!
---
Im at lvl33 at the moment and every 3-4 pulls I end up having to drink to get mana back. 
---
I try to off set this by pulling 4-5 mobs at a time (2-3 packs) depending on the dungeon and them down ranking consecrate after initial agro. 
---
Fig once I get the bone set (what ever its called with def and MP5) from scholo this will get a little better but will still need to drink every 3-4 pulls ü§£ (by better, I mean i will regen mana faster while drinking, this dropping drinking time).
---
Delete this and stop spreading wrong information
---
I actually did the HoJ math last night and can confirm your numbers for it.
---
If you spec deep in destro, lock can do some serious bursts and one shot people basically.
---
This is the worst build i ever seen, ever.
---
Never go bowling... didn‚Äôt you see what happened to Mankrik‚Äôs wife?
---
This is what I meant.
---
I can track people all over the world IRL if they have share locations on.
---
It's not faster in most of the groups. Most of then are worse and uncoordinated. I haven't been in even 1 that wasn't significantly worse than any other normal group I was in
---
I mean, yeah that could be a problem. But unless you have a pretty expensive WiFi-setup it is easy for it to drop in performance if more than one is connected to it. There's a reason WiFi is not widely used in gaming. 
---
Hopefully your option will solve the problem!
---
It obviously provides an unfair advantage, but Blizzard doesn't ban individual addons. They make addons not work by changing the underlying code.
---
"Spy just reads off the combat log" doesn't mean "so players could easily do that, too!" It means you can't stop addons from reading the combat log without banning those addons, too.
---
The calls for banning spy should be talking about specific combat log events that need to be redacted from display to all addons.
---
Like "enemy casting a spell nearby shouldn't be displayed to any addon if you're not in combat with that person" --&gt; okay, so you won't be able to see that a mage is full channeling pyroblast at you (or your party member, or your ally) until it's out.
---
I agree they should ban spy, but I don't see how to ban spy.
---
bizzno, lmfao
---
Sure thing bro, but the last few days I‚Äôve played the matchup and it‚Äôs been fine for me.
---
No, spy will show anyone who appears in your combat log and thats includes anyone with a buff or aura, thats includes the libram enchant and stances.
---
At the same time offering free faction changes for accounts on the most dominate faction.
---
Healthy servers is farm more important than a temporary inconvenience for some players.
---
I contend its not about complexity of the mechanic but that the devs have create add-on visible data in order to allow the add-on to work. People could see the boss starting to glow a bright orange, but dbm can't so they add a text line so the boss is shouting like a cheesy villain.
---
&gt; So it works like any addon in the game by simplifying stuff that is hard manually?
---
That is part of it, yes. 
---
&gt; If you think so maybe pledge for disabling all addons. Because that's literally all they do.
---
But they don't all give a direct advantage over other players that aren't using the addon themselves. I couldn't care less about some addon that allows QoL changes to make it easier to see your bags for example, as they aren't really reducing any skillcap.
---
The difference is, it would take you 15 corpse hops instead of 3.
---
Not quite at this guy's level, but while leveling on my priest, I would sometimes cast my shield, cast dots, begin wanding, then alt-tab or take a bathroom break, them come back after a while to cast shield and dots again.
---
lol skillgap in wpvp. You just want to gank people, when they are not ready. Admit it.
---
Of course they can ban it.
---
They announce that the addon is now bannable, give people a few weeks to delete it and if you didn't, you first get a small temp ban warning you to delete it.
---
99% of people would shit their pants and delete the addon, problem solved.
---
Yeah ill do for sure, hurts a lot thinking how much time it costs to farm that much gold -.- 
---
Somewhere in phase 2 I think I'll respec again, when I have more experience in pvp an stuff and I can better tell what I want.
---
Actually you're wrong I'm still on Skeram, transfers were not even up when I made the post and if I was on heartseeker I wouldn't be bringing it up.
---
_exactly_
---
It's funny because we could see how many unique names were on a server and take a census and they were like "NOPE get that outta here" but apparently everyone running around with Track Humanoid on because of a mod is okay.
---
That's a good way to waste your gold u less you really truat your sniper string.
---
LFR didn't make raiding easier. It made end-game content accessible for players who don't have time to play in a raiding guild.
---
Real raiding (HC/Mythic) is still challenging. LFR didn't change anything about that.
---
They have taken actions against ninjas but in specific circumstances.
---
Fairly sure macroing is bannable.
---
Why do you say of instead of have? Sounds weird to me. (not my first language)
---
Is this a regional thing?
---
imagine taking the time to do all that though... its annoying. you have trouble reading the picture w a mobile screenshot? no you dont lol
---
Wrong person? Ha
---
duelwield warriors? I bet most people here arent using heroic strike queue.
---
But else, yes you are correct.
---
Could you please tell me which addon is that bar at the top?
---
Ye its that talent that breaks the spec. If reckoning is not utilized like described above I would stick to retri. Well it doesnt really matter since you force crit by sitting. However, Id avoid +defense anyways since the redoubt talent and reckoning (if used in a normal fashion) are more effective the more you get critted.
---
Give me free game time I wil. Otherwise no I‚Äôm not leaving my guild, people who helped me and the economy I know for a server that will have 500 raid loggers in 6 months.
---
Honestly, I'd rather get ganked than 'sense' someone is coming with an addon. WPvP interactions should be exciting imo.
---
Why would you need 2?
---
Because they have small and continuously dwindling populations relative to other servers. No one wants to play on a ghost town when there are other realms with tons of people on them making it 10x more fun.  
---
I know people like to reference how vanilla wow had much less people, but that doesn't change the fact that medium pop servers right now are basically ghost towns. No amount of cope will change this fact. 
---
I say these things because there have been people who have transferred off high pop realms to low pop realms and ended up rerolling back onto the high pop realms because of how boring it was with hardly any people.
---
I bought Transmute: Water to Undeath because i thought it read the other way around and that someone had accidently posted it for 30g instead of 300g. FeelsBadMan
---
Your uncle must be Blizzard
---
Yes, when they already changed things for the worse anyway.
---
bracers from first boss in DM north and the staff from Trib?
---
\~1:30 intro, oof
---
Yeah, that sounds like it could work, without too much impact.
---
Keep in mind I don't know how leveling is in retail but warriors start off slow and boring.  A lot of it is literally autoattacks with sunder/rend.  It gets a decent jump in the 30s when you have zerker stance + new abilities like WW, pummel, SS + tactical mastery to change between stances.  By 60 it feels pretty good IMO.  
---
Shadowbolt spam for warlocks is a raid thing and not so much for leveling so its almost the opposite of warriors by going from diverse spells -&gt; shadowbolt spam.
---
Nothing really special/new . I prefer skill based videos like mn
---
As a feral pvp, you can either do the 4 point shadowcraft set (several of the shadowcraft pieces that give highest stats) + various others, or collect more hibrid-y gear. There is no general good set or BiS for that matter, as it's all a choice between more damage or more utility. Barring the shadowcraft pieces for set bonus some BiS-es sort of are Mixologist tunic, myrmidon signet, emberfury talisman (you're gonna struggle for stamina anyway, don't take fordring, trust me) and serpentite sash iirc. Impervious giant or the 30 str 1% crit mace are your weapon, switching to a warden staff or unyielding mace for melees.
---
Since you specifically asked about end-game 40-man dungeons. Paladin tanks have no place here so you only have one choice: Warriors. Druids can't tank because of crushing blows.
---
&gt;Can I download an addon to remove your bubble or any other annoying Paladin thing?
---
You mean like an enemy cast bar addon that would let you know when to interrupt heals?
---
Just like your health and mana bars. People shouldn't get those spoon-fed with pretty bars. Let's get rid of all the combat UI stuff and just watch the combat log. That's the only way to be absolutely fair.
---
1. I'm not whining. I accept what happens.
---
2. I wasn't aware that If somebody else wants to PVP, I have to reciprocate. I am not allowed to consent, I absolutely must respond in kind. Thank you for letting me know I do not have agency.
---
What‚Äôs the name of your castbar addon? Mine is so ugly compared to yours
---
idk man, I've watched Pshero do it for hours and he manages just fine
---
I HoT and DoT and kite.  I barely ever use cat form in PvP unless I‚Äôm fighting a mage.
---
crusader I farmed my 2 orbs by myself while doing pickup strats
---
Food I pre-farmed a couple hundred wolf-meats myself and I cook myself
---
It's agi elixirs, buying yellow crystals to make bombs (in addition to farming as much as i can by myself), 2K armor potions, buying everything I can find cheap on the AH as str buff (sometimes scrolls, sometimes potions), black rums yes, and the most expensive are fire res potions.
---
I have to admit I now have a decent reserve of everything but fire res pots, this I can't get enough, they are crazy expensive AND rare on my server
---
And I did all of that because when being recruited, it was talked about that they didn't have a main tank, and I was made to understand I would be the main tank. Now I'm in, I understand there are already 3 people competing for main tank position , all better geared than I am.
---
I also ended getting assigned the worst healer, who was not even 60 until yesterday, so I died a lot in those 10 days.
---
Maybe, just maybe he does not give a fuck up about the colour of the dick and more of the image the website try to portray black people in? 
---
Where's the black plumber? Pizza delivery guy? 
---
I mean c'mon! Not everyone can be a rap star and sucsessfull doctor. Thats not porn jobs.
---
I dont see the point of disagreeing when the devs themselves said so. Are you implying they are lying or do you actually think you know better?
---
&gt; 3 hours a day on average isn't THAT casual tbf.
---
Yeah I agree, that's not casual at all. It's insane that people are calling this level of engagement 'casual'. That unless you had MC and Ony on farm a month in you're a 'casual' player (an exaggeration sure but not far off).
---
This is far from a casual investment in something. If someone did any other activity every day for 3 hours a day there's no way we'd refer to that as a 'casual hobby'.
---
So ambushing players is fine if they have to take a fight they weren't ready for but not the other way around?
---
Projection
---
You legit need no consumables at all for MC. So you can just save 200g in 3 weeks by being smart.
---
Except they actually encourage people on POPULATED servers to transfer for FREE to a less populated server. While I do find a problem with their laggy shit shows that are multi-raid pvp battles, I agree that increasing the server cap is not the solution.
---
Not really. The first time I heard of a full flasked raid was when Nihilum did their C'Thun world first. But since Blizzard has later nerfed the fight I doubt even that will be necessary today.
---
Whoever can be the cheesier druid and spam moonfire faster. Isn't that all druids do? Root and spam moonfire
---
Enemy mage is channeling pyroblast at your face. No add-on can display what they're casting, the target of the spell, how long they've been casting it.
---
Enemy priest channels mind control. You have nameplates on, but you see nothing.
---
Roll mage. I usually have 66-68 bag slots free.
---
132 for a Lotuses? What is your server son
---
Nah. Its mostly sub 60 casuals who post pictures of their first brd clearruns.
---
My real issue is my 200-400ms and it's not that stable really, so anything that requires muscle memory for timing is impossible, I wanted to try this spec out tho and my pala is at 37 currently (11-16-0).
---
Guess I'll avoid +def gear and try to take mobs a couple levels higher to get them sweet self crits, holy shield at 41 is something to look forward to as well.
---
I mean if you're swimming in cash like that then you can use all the consumables you like.
---
I just don't get the approach "if you farm the mats it's free" cause you cpuld just farm gold and buy the mats. Fsrming the mats is more fun ofc doing everything through gold doesn't feel the same.
---
Mages are indeed the biggest assholes and the new meme hunter class
---
Lmao, why the rush? Im having fun by leveling my alchemy with the hearts from silverpine and fishing aswell. Its like a pserver but you know your data wont be lost.. its great
---
True. Sulfuras/Incendius were probably the best choices. Full populations + strong faction balance + stable servers + no streamer bullshit + only small queue times if any. This way you also hedge against future player drop so you'll still be playing on an active realm.
---
Are there many quests to do in Azshara?
---
What is this madness of dropping Eng!!!
---
That's not remotely comparable to seeing stealth lmao. What do you think, that I can spam interrupt every second?
---
When tanking MC as Dual wield Fury/Prot what bosses would advice using a shield against?
---
Not interested in the viability of this and that, merely info.
---
No, some of my friends are morons.
---
Most of the popular addon give you an advantage over people not using them though. Boss mods, cooldown timers, auto attack timer, resource tick timer, literally anything you can make with WeakAuras, .... The list goes on and on. Only because you got used to some of them doesn't make it better.
---
Where can I check the armor value of each individual bosses? As you said there are bosses with 3000 armor and 3700, so not every bossfight would need to use Annihilator.
---
Similar addons existed but combat log is from modern version and works differently than back in vanilla anyways.
---
I honestly can't tell if this is copypasta or not.
---
If not a lot of people farm them it is entirely feasible. I mean it is already worth it if you find around 1 per hour. Because you get a ton of other plants as well.
---
Guild enchanter gets the license to print money by getting enchanting formulas from raid. No way in hell any raider is paying for enchants.
---
One time these rogues were ganking lowbies in Stonetalon by ambushing them in the mountain pass below Stonetalon Peak. Some guildies and I went up and cleared them out, then camped their corpses a little while. 
---
There are some high ledges in that pass that are difficult to get to. One of those rogues somehow got up there and rezzed, thinking he was safe because we couldn't see him. To be honest, we couldn't, and I would have never known he was up there. However once he rezzed, of course Spy went off and I was able to target him. He's sitting somewhere, eating, and I could see that he wasn't leaving because he was still close enough to target.
---
This is an unfair advantage. Since I could tell he was still nearby, I just ran in circles spamming charge to the tune of *"That is too far away"* as he ate, until it finally clicked -- and my toon charged straight up the impassable crevasse to kill him.
---
I should have never known that guy was way up there. This was super unfair and I knew it.
---
Dagger Specialization, maybe for a [spec like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005-30230320205001-05)
---
&gt;None of the servers with high population atm is going to end up dead
---
He wasn't talking about the high pop servers, more about dead servers like EF or AR
---
We have our enhancement shaman stand on the other side of Ragnaros, closer to the tanks and provide them with totems. Run in and out like the rest of the melee, while making sure not to be in knockback range of anyone else.
---
You can jump out on the sides with wall jumping.
---
Both classes are great fun to level. Neither class is particularly exciting to raid with (PvE endgame). Warlocks are more fun (imo) for end-game PVP. 
---
Fin.
---
A Corsair gaming device. I have one too so I know what he means. Though mine‚Äôs the older model.
---
Yes they will, and they will RMT so their guild can afford it.
---
Also the holy tree which final talent is a pure damaging spell. 
---
And start with a 2-minute long buff on the one who received your one-hour long cooldown Lay on Hands.
---
Also, what the hell is divine strenght doing so deep in the tree...
---
/stuck
---
It impacts the game far too much for an addon. Of course it should be banned, it's not a question of whether you think it's fair or not. Other addons improve the UI for convenience and are used to cycle information more efficiently or effectively. This addon straight up gives information you would not have been able to figure out otherwise.
---
you think you do
---
It doesn't let you see people in stealth. It let's you see when people nearby go into stealth. What do you think, that I can spam perception every second?
---
Reminds me of this.
---

---
Waiting in SW for ony head to drop.
---
&gt; no, naxx would be hard. Still i'm sure we'll clean it in 5-6 hours, and 2-3 hours next times
---
Wait, now it's hard? What happened to "they are not hard at all."? 
---
You made a statement as if it applies to the average population. You agree that it's hard. You then expect your guild to clear it in 2-3 hours, which is slower than your initial claim of 1-2 hours to clear the places?
---
&gt; since i managed to clear in 4.5 with a random raid on private server (1st time opened).
---
I've already mentioned that the average "hardcoreness" of the population on a private server is likely significantly higher than in Classic. Do you disagree with that notion? Otherwise I don't see how this supports much in regards to how average raiders will perform in Classic Naxx. 
---
How many of the people in that private server raid are "households, dads with children and others not so hardcore players, awesome people but some are not interested enough to manage one or two button rotation of their class flawlessly"? And how many of them have tried Naxx before? 
---
Thank you for not trying to use your guilds MC experience as a supportive argument by the way. 
---
&gt; AQ40 will be a bit longer cause of trash, bosses are nothing, still, i expect it like 3-4 hours 1st time and 2-3 hours further raids.
---
What happened to the "in like 1-2 hours at max."? Suddenly it's 3-4 and 2-3 hours? Why are you suddenly changing the goalposts?
---
It‚Äôs only made worse by the fact that people never stack those quests. It‚Äôll be do spiders first then complain about wolves then later go back for wolves and bam, only spiders now.
---
Have you done Gnomer and RFK?  If not do them (easy level with all the quests). Then head to thousand needle and do the salt flats. Lots of quests for another easy level. Then its time to start STV north.
---
Have you tried using VuhDo? Great addon which would solve this
---
Are there still servers with queues? :O
---
&gt; Blizzard could still save this with just a few clicks/lines of code by restricting the faction transfers to horde - both realms would get more balanced.
---
EXACTLY - Horde pop increasing on Heartseeker means it must be decreasing elsewhere, so they'd be balancing multiple servers at once. Here are the servers currently open to Heartseeker and their ratio per OP's link:
---
**Fairbanks:** 66:34 Horde
---
**Herod:** 62:38 Horde
---
**Kromcrush:** 55:45 Horde
---
**Skeram:** *74:26* Horde
---
**Stalagg:** 67:33 Horde
---
With the exception of Kromcrush (and Herod to a lesser extent), these are unhealthy and borderline unsustainable ratios in favor of Horde. Restricting xfers to Horde could literally balance 5-6 realms at once. Instead they're only going to make it worse - now the remaining Alliance on those servers are going to come to Heartseeker which will just create a further imbalance. It is a mind bogglingly stupid decision on Blizzard's part. 
---
What really sucks is, my guild and I took a chance on Heartseeker when it had just opened so we could "be part of the solution" to the queues and to grow a new server, and now it feels like we're being punished. We were the ones that made a sacrifice for the health of the game, leaving behind a populated, Horde dominant server, but we're getting the short end of the stick now and Blizzard just seems to not care.
---
Man. I'm on Smolderweb and last I checked Black Lotus was going for like 42g. I have 2 in my bag that I'm just holding onto for when the price goes up.

Kids invaded the chat again?
---
could you share your talent tree? not sure if there‚Äôs an easy way to do that. I wanted to switch to enhancement for pvp, but the damage output from Ele feels more consistent and you just inspired me to stick with elemental!
---
I like your The Prodigy - Voodoo People addition. It narrows it down to only 98% of all PvP videos ever made.
---
I looked at that yesterday. Seems to be a common theme.... 
---
    Bag categories for automatic item sorting (Retail only)
---
Maybe I should try it anyways.
---
What rogue or cat DPs is going to use up to four pieces of gear that provide only crit % and no agility? Shadow fang set (T0) is vastly superior, or Cadaverous. Why would a rogue or cat want to stack dodge % with almost no stamina?
---
I mean like a hunter
---
I second this. Cuckolding and bbc bullfucking is a devils spawn, which tri-fucks every party involved. Loathes the white male and his small penis with insecurities, destroys women by stigmatizing being "used" by a black dick and lastly, blacks get portrayed as nothing else but a creature with a big dick. Dumb, good for nothing else, big dick.
---
This new porn trend is a sin, and who ever likes watching that shit, stop, you're financing pain.
---
Which still ruins the chance of a perfect surprise gank. 
---
Anyone who defends this addon is essentially a Retail LFG player, except it's worse than LFG.
---
im sure i knew what he meant as well but corsair is a brand, i have corsair mouse keyboard and headset, none of which explain keybinds
---
The LFG tool was banned in the state it was intended at launch. If they want they can ban this one too.
---
It's very simple, they tell the addon author to remove the files from the net, and they can surely scan to check if that addon is installed on clients
---
If one druid is hotw/NS you just run around and whoever gives up first loses.
---
If both proper feral, you'll usually win by getting 5 CP ferocious bite to crit.
---
God no it isn't. Unless you're tanking ofc.
---
I may be incorrect, but hit rating isn't required for PvP, why do you have 3 points in it?

 &lt;SALT MINERS&gt; -HEROD  -  10/10  1/1  Hour and 45 minute clears , Ony Splits 
---
**ABOUT US -** Salt Miners is a Progression / Semi-Hardcore guild for Classic created by a veteran group of players. Experience in Vanilla up to Saph, tons of PS experience, ranking pushes, mythic raiding and multiple gladiator titles after Vanilla. We are mainly a PvE focused guild but will likely have PvP related events throughout Classic‚Äôs life span. Leadership is a bunch of laid back 30+ year olds who are goal oriented, most of our members are mature individuals. Applicants under 25 years of age will be considered with the understanding that you will be working with an older crowd. We want to kill bosses and have a great time doing it, we aren‚Äôt here to babysit or micromanage anyone. You take care of your stuff and we will take care of the raids.
---
**GOALS -**We are setting our sights on having our first raid night 4 weeks after launch. Our overall goal for Classic is to clear all content available. All raids will be conducted and driven by efficiency.
---
**RAID SCHEDULE -** Tuesday / Wednesday 6-9pm PST, 9-12am EST, with optional raid on Saturdays for old / farm content.
---
**LOOT -** Loot will be distributed by a 5 man loot council. Determinations on loot will be made based on attendance, performance, guild presence, attitude, and reward density.
---
**Attendance** \- This is the number one thing you can do to guarantee you get your items. If you show up to every raid, on time, with your consumes, and a proper spec, I guarantee we will take care of you.
---
**Performance** \- This is pretty standard stuff. If you are killing it we are going to get you the tools you need to do your thing.
---
**Guild Presence** \- Here are some things that I would include in this aspect; helping people get their pre-bis items, running optional raids, attending guild events, spying for world bosses. It‚Äôs literally everything you do OUTSIDE the raid that helps the guild. We take note of all that and your contributions wont be forgotten.
---
**Attitude** \- Nobody likes a debbie downer and nobody likes side cliques where you have people trash talking half the raid. While we know that there is no way you are going to get 40 people in the same room without some personality clashes, we expect everyone to act like adults. People that are good at setting aside their differences and working as a team will be rewarded.
---
**Reward Density** \- We understand that you aren‚Äôt going to want to raid for 3 months before you see your first piece of gear just because you don‚Äôt have quite as much time to invest as Joe Schmoe. We are going to spread the love around while making sure key players get key items.
---
**EXPECTATIONS**AttendanceAttendanceAttendanceAttendance
---
We don‚Äôt want to recruit a large bench. Be on time or let us know before hand if you will be late or gone that night.
---
We are looking for people who understand progression raiding and don‚Äôt need me or anyone else to constantly inspect you or check your buff bar. Self accountability is a big deal.
---
People who start side discords or chat channels with the sole purpose of bad mouthing other guildies will be removed and there will be no warning for this process at all. If you are making the raid unfun for people because you have an excessively negative attitude, you like calling out people‚Äôs mistakes, or you just generally are being a turd we will attempt to work with you to curb this stuff, but at the end of the day you are expected to be a pleasant person to raid with.
---
Please note there is a difference between friendly banter or competitiveness and being an Ahole. We banter with eachother all the time and crack jokes. Just make sure it‚Äôs all in good fun. It‚Äôs just as important to have thick skin as it is to be pleasant to others.
---
I emphasize complete and total transparency with leadership. You can expect to come to me for any problems you have for any reason and it will be taken seriously.
---
**RAID NEEDS-** 
---
Current class demand: Druid: Low  
---
Hunter:  
---
Shaman:   
---
Warlock:   
---
Fury Warrior:   
---
 All strong applicants will be considered. Raid slots are merit based. Just because your class is in low demand doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be invited to compete for a raid spot.

Ragnaros has a despawn timer of 2 hours.
---
Majordomo has a respawn timer of 2-3 hours only if Ragnaros is not killed within 2 hours.
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt the registry include what server they are on? Unless I‚Äôm missing something
---
There is no Raid tanking with Paladins. You simply lack the necessary tools
---
Ah, the roaring twenties. Everyone just blasts through the twenties and probably only stop once or twice for SFK and BFD. I would say SM is the first instance where you would have a group in no-time.
---
&gt; None of the servers with high population atm is going to end up dead
---
Many of them are dead already, especially if you end up on the low-end faction, you this is just bullshit. A couple of servers where you can transfer to from Gehennas only has 3-5 raiding guilds. That's fucking dead.
---
Azeroth has 2 moons iirc
---
Didn't know about this one, much appreciated. ;)
---
&gt; I like the fact flasks are rare
---
I also like this. Its not like in bfa where you just pop 1k of gold to get a temporal buff. Want a good buff? Pay a good amount of gold.
---
Haha

Warrior looking for guild Horde Sulfuras PvP. I‚Äôm a casual player, but a reliable adult looking to raid one night of the week after 8pm server est. I am newly 60 with ~half my prebis tank gear. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a new guild as it gives me more opportunities to MT and progress. In vanilla I played a hunter in a top 100 guild and have experience helping friends get HWL. I am an experienced raid leader and a happy follower, as real life is a priority nowadays. I‚Äôm getting in the tanking groove and would love to be a key member of your guild. I‚Äôm further away from dps prebis, but I would be happy to dps if that is what you need.
---
Hmm I see. Prot withour reckoning abuse will not be faster than standard ret, however if you enjoy the prot spec more I wont argue against you! Best of luck!
---
EP lists are (or should be) based on a bunch of theorycrafting done by pserver communities, which should be somewhat reliable for dps classes since the goal is very clear (max damage), but for healers and tanks there is no correct answer and everyone will have a different opinion on how to balance mana/healing or mitigation/threat.
---
Post macros please, I wanna try it out later
---
Just because something was available in vanilla doesn't mean it should make its way to classic, if that were the case the macros the developers talked about that were in vanilla that basically automated rotation gameplay should also be available now...
---
Then he shouldnt care about falling behind
---
&gt; Aye it's possible, but how much easier is it to have the addon do things for you? 
---
Ehm yes, that's the reason addons exist and are used in the first place. Because they make things easier and more convenient. That's the case for pretty much every single addon out there.
---
That alone isn't a good argument against a specific addon.
---
No, not really, maybe 1-2 hours worth, but there's good density of mobs if you want to grind and it's generally quiet.
---
Why would he consider his entire guild rerolling from scratch? He has a couple of optional servers to transfer to from Faerline - none of them good. These "healthy servers in between the two extremes" - how the fuck are those an option to him?
---
Yeah I just hit 60 this weekend and my guild of 300+ members probably has around 30ish level 60s now. We haven't even started raiding yet minus the handful of members who've run in pugs.
---
I've already called dibs on tomorrow. Get in line, buddy.
---
I always imagine that when the question item doesn't drop it is cause it was broken or ripped during the fray, and the giver wants pristine items.
---
Its also not stated anywhere you need to supply people with food as a mage, but as humans we form norms and cultures on our own.
---
*I hit level 60 the first week of Vanilla on my rogue* 
---
Ok that‚Äôs where you lost everyone reading this
---
Another one is Group Bulletin Board which I use. The one I get the most out of though is Prat with custom filters to output to raid warnings. Someone had posted a tutorial earlier. What is great about Prat /w filters is that you do not have to put any effort into scanning a chat window.
---
what a pirate server?
---
&gt; If you've ever done LFR you know how difficult it is to get everyone in your raid to do something. 
---
That's a really disingenuous comparison though. LFR is a bunch of randoms, who don't listen to you and don't care, it's near impossible to coordinate anything, which is why it has to be made easy. 
---
A guild is completely different, if you act like the average LFR player in a guild, be it on retail or classic, you won't last long, assuming the officers give a shit.
---
I'm only half way to cap, i'm not worried /dives behind tree
---
That's a long way away tho
---
It basically adds another layer of skill. Exactly like you describe it. It's not like rogues can't counter this addon - just stealth outside of detection range if you suspect/stalk a victim, or wait and make them think you didn't stealth to attack them (I hate when rogues do that - go in stealth and never show up again, they could be waiting to strike any time but you simply can't be sure).
---
Basically makes your stealth turn into psychological warfare.
---
I was often called to OT so. And being alive means I will do dps when the rogues are eating the dust in the floor:)
---
But I will ofc not raid as hardcore. I expect that I only will see MC in classic and that any harder raid will be too much effort needed.
---
I feel like it didn‚Äôt work 15 years ago specifically in this chimney.
---
I've gotten to lvl 55 on my Prot Paladin without a single add-on.
---
I suppose that will change once I have to respec Holy for Raiding, I find it hilarious that people say that the game is impossible to play without add-ons.
---
He is a very famous rogue vanilla PvPer. Although I dont think there's any Arathi Basin footage in any of his movies. There is some WSG and AV but mostly its world-pvp.
---
‚ÄúWe especially encourage players on Arugal , Faerlina , Herod , and Whitemane to use the Free Character Move service to avoid excessive queues.‚Äù
---
Yes, it will die, because you all QQ instead of solving the problem
---
It‚Äôs almost like... people shouldn‚Äôt join massive servers that the game wasn‚Äôt designed for. A shocking realization
---
Am I missing some joke?
---
Hahaha I got married a few days after release, then went on a month long honeymoon. A week after I came back I started playing but didn‚Äôt know what to play. Tested various classes by levelling them a bit, Pala and Mage to 15, Priest to 24, Warlock to 31, Rogue to 34 and now a Druid to 21. I referenced the Druid as it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to 60 with!
---
You probably froze or fired up the blood to be unusable. It's all about surgical precision, or lack thereof.
---
A hunter can track in many ways, though. I understood you mean physical tracks/hoof prints. They have trail cameras, drones, decoys, and other methods to find and hunt animals in the real world. Look at dog the bounty hunter. He finds people out on bond all the time. His minimal must be massive.
---
47 on the verge of 48 ...gonna be a fun ride :)
---
&gt; Well I've given you examples
---
You made the initial claim (that the majority of players are level 60) and hence you inherit the burden of evidence. 
---
&gt; and until you can give any counter to anything I've said, 
---
And I've responded critically to the examples you've presented and explained why I don't think they are reliable to be able to state something like you did as if it were a fact. 
---
&gt; it's better than everything you've brought to the discussion.
---
I've asked several valid critical questions, which is definitely part of an actual discussion. I've also listed arguments as to why I view some of your examples with criticism. And you are claiming I haven't brought anything to the discussion? Do you realize what you are writing? 
---
&gt; Why do you care so much? I wasn't even talking to you originally.
---
I'm sorry, did I barge into a private conversation? I simply saw you state things with a rather high amount of certainty and I was curious as to how you obtained the information and what it was based upon.
---
Do you need to have the eye of devinity equipped the whole time? Or can you switch trickets before the encounter starts
---
we only managed to do one sw raid and didn't get to do the other capitals before DHKs are introduced
---
wpvp is actually better without honor system because it's about thrilling fights with equal opponents not killing as many lvl 48+ players as fast as possible while avoiding enemy towns and fair fights
---
As one who was on the unofficial polish server in retail for 3 expansions, I can confirm this statement.
---
That's Azeroth's moons. One is the White Lady aka Elune aka Mu'sha, the other one is the Blue Child
---
nice.
---
A stack?
---
Haven't got exact numbers because I'm at work but for both DPS and TPS it's a substantial increase
---
This, definitely!
---
I've given a friend in retail 200K gold, doubt blizz even thought twice about 1 or 2 K gold trade
---
I'm on ashkandi horde and the only way you're getting to MC (much less ony) is to be in one of 3 guilds
---
That‚Äôs you isn‚Äôt it? You‚Äôre Mesofunky
---
I have only had one experience that became lame because of the spy addon. I was sneaking around Stormwind with my friend (I am druid, he is rogue) and this little level 30 something warrior literally ran right up to me (I was in stealth and behind some crates along the canal) and hit me out of stealth.
---
Literally, he ran from the other side of the canal, across a bridge, down the levy and right up to me. Had me targeted the whole time like 20+ levels lower than me.
---
Well beating backpedaling monkeys is just not much to brag about.
---
Only if they are near enough for the nameplate to show.
---
If you fly or ride by outside that distance (20 yards or so?) it won't register. And frankly the nameplate itself is a pretty huge giveaway that someone is near you.
---
The warrior armor quest where you have to gather 8 sturdy shinbones from the orcs in Wetlands is nice for that. Every orc drops 2 shinbones, but you have to test them to see if they are strong enough, and about 70% of them break. 
---
But it would be really annoying to have to go through that for every single quest!
---
[Prat with Custom Filters](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dju8in/lfg_chat_going_too_fast_missing_messages_heres/) may be the answer for you.
---
It is honestly pretty great
---
Try cast sequence macro
---
Well, you say you run NS/HotW.
---
Do you wear Healgear with that or Feral Gear?
---
If you got Feral Gear you should be able to out pressure him by playing more aggressive.
---
If you wear Healgear, maybe try to get a Hibernate off and drink.
---
Get the max out off the 5 second rule.
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
jam with yo-yo ma?
---
I love this mentality, goodluck brother.
---
&gt;TBC will most likely have stand alone servers
---
This is probably one of the most unlikely things that would happen. Blizzard is not going to let people progress through classic with their characters putting in hundreds of days of work only to have everyone start at level 1 like private servers do.
---
There are a series of reasons why stand alone TBC servers arent a good idea. 
---
1) Including the fact that one 2.4.3 horde is objectively a better pve and pvp faction meaning given the choice 90% of players choose horde causing massive imbalance. Every bc server run privately has had this problem and even offering things like free epic mounts to alliance, free respecs, free professions has not worked because of just how much easier it is to be horde.
---
2) The economy including players already having some gold and professions levels becomes broken beyond repair with the lack of old world resources, things in the level 40 range go for 10x what they would normally because no one hangs out in they level range long enough to supply an entire server needing to level professions.
---
3) Blizzard has beaten the horse to death in terms of saying they want to provide an authentic experience. Being 60 and running through the dark portal with your guild and friends is how it actually worked in 2007. Blizzard wont make people level from 1 on expansion servers.

Are you just incapable of accepting critisism?
---
I understand it's not part of the game, and I agree that it shouldn't be around.  
---
I'm just laughing at /u/HunterGaming's thought process as to why it's not okay
---
FUN DETECTED.
---
Salty much? yikes
---
i don't play on faerlina
---
Everything that can't be instance farmed yeah. Say goodbye to black lotus if you're on a high pop server.
---
Just got 53.. Even trying to spam BRD is going to be a shit show.
---
Until there's an add-on that both finds a four people group and also teleports you inside the dungeon, your comparison is ridiculous.
---
Phase 2 got pushed to the 14th.
---
thank you.  
---
yes that is a good point and i am aware that there is no universal answer by far, but i would like to get some deeper fundamental understanding of the stat values.  
---
yeah i know my own judgement is most important in the end, but how can i get a deeper understanding of the individual values in the first place? is there a good resource? testing ingame is really difficult as most of the values don't even say what they do exactly.
---
You're stealthed actions would need to appear in your targets combat log. No idea if that's true for poisons. Distract most likely though.
---
Tremor is 30 yd regardless of that talent
---
Lots of people are still playing and enjoying themselves
---
Open world materials were never designed to accomodate 10k+ people, so yes, layering was necessary to keep up with the demand. Layer hopping was not good because it was abusable, but the cooldown made it much less feasible.
---
I know that feel.
---
I started a month ago - just hit 52
---
Absolutely burnt out to fuck, and just can't be arsed knowing I'll be a walking mob spawn for honour grinding soon.
---

---
Icemail jerkin sells for de price and its a 39 epic. The color of an item isn't always a good indication of value. This shield is pretty iconic though!
---
whats substential? 10%, 20% 30%
---
well, considering its not actually classic, I don't see how.
---
No your missing the conversation context. One guy siad what about making a withdraw consent to combat log data. Next guy said blizzard own that. I said blizzard would still get the data just 3rd parties would not

the problem isnt the  balance, its the fact that you dont have a solid group with you. Find that guild that will fight back and put effort with them and youll see that people on the populated faction wont be able to fuck with you.  The only thing that matter is your guild not your faction.
---
Interesting. Do you know if they're DS/Ruin spec? I think it would make a lot of sense if that's the case, because they wouldnt already be taking up a debuff slot with their Corruptions (as is necessary for SM/Ruin locks). Also, about how many warlocks do you raid with?
---
Our bear offtank has been using them to grab ony after phase 2 and it's absolute insanity. Our warrior tank doesn't have a chance of ripping ony off him, and neither does our DPS. It's actually kinda hilarious. I imagine it's gotta be similarly nuts for feral dps.
---
Find a good mage and 3-way split. Reserving all the orbs usually means getting fresh 60s or 58-59 dds resulting in hour long runs. With a good mage you can clear strat live 2 times in one hour netting you ~1,5 orbs per person/per hour. That's around 40g from orbs alone per hour. It's what i do when i want some socialization and/or just can't be bothered to open graves in ZF anymore.
---
Which servers specifically are those? I'll admit that I haven't changed servers for at least a week but last time I checked I could find two servers on medium population, the rest on High or Layered. Vanilla never had ridiculously overpopulated realms with 15k players making the game unplayable and Classic never will either.
---
I farmed all of the essences for the mage robe, the air I found was super easy! The fire is easy as well, and for the earth if you have an alchemist you can get the life to earth recipe and transmute daily from 1 living essence which is cheaper or easier to farm. Essence of water sucked though.
---
Wont stop kids from crying tho
---
Do you need to have the eye equipped throughout the whole event or can I equip another tricket
---
45. I've been trying to finish up quests in tanaris so I can go to hinterlands after the patch drops. My theory is that hinterlands will have way fewer alliance out hunting. I wanted to level through searing gorge but that's never going to happen.
---
dunno, just assumed that hit was also necessary in PvP
---
This is not lag. You obviously don't know he's specced deep protection for 20 second HoJ.
---
Doesnt make it "tryhard" its a proffession that is available for everyone and yes is useful in PVP??
---
No they don't
---
Well yes, that was his point. Enjoying Classic much more than BFA, therefore playing Classic much more than BFA.
---
&gt;The one who first ran out of mana lost
---
You said it. Basically in 1v1 druid doesn't die as long as there is mana left.
---
Dungeons as healer
---
VICTORY! WE HAVE VICTORY!
---
Classic 1-10 has more content than bfa maybe thats why
---
While I agree with the sentiment, let's not forget that this is a heavily nerfed version of MC.
---
But regarding Naxx.... I think tons of people know the fights already thanks to WOTLK re release of the raid. Which will mean a lot less of learning the raid.
---
Thats fine, only the real competitive guilds will be able to raid and complete content. It makes it more  challenging.
---
Sorry for asking but what changes at 48?
---
It‚Äôs not like they drop gold
---
!remindme 1 day
---
The thing about spy is that unlike a lot of add ons, everything it does is pretty directly doable without the addon outside of the sound alerts, but that's just amplifying what's already there. 
---
Spy only alerts you as soon as someone is in targetting range, it literally cannot detect players outside it. How do you undo this? By making people not targettable unless visible? That breaks a ton of things in the game even without addons. Shorten the target range? Then you're making everyone's experience worse over hardly a band aid solution. 
---
And same with stealth. I see a lot of people complaining about it here, how if you try to sneak up on them in stealth, they get an audio que and they're able to catch you that way - but that sound effect is little more than an edit on the already existing sound you get when a stealthed unit is within detection range - it sounds different and is slightly louder, something you could make happen without much need for addons. 
---
At the end of the day, this addon is just heightening the awareness of already existing features that would be really disruptive to remove or edit. I main a hunter and my alt is a rogue. Yes, I wish I was more special with my track humanoids, and sure, sneaking up on people might be easier without this existing. But I would still prefer this exist than not, because tracking humanoids still has its advantages, stealth is still extremely effective against unsuspecting players (and even people who know to be cautious of my presence) and this addon offers easier access to things I would already want to use (such as targetting macros for enemy players) but would be less comfortable doing so because of their clunkiness.
---
This diesn't break the game. removing it would, and if you have issues with it ruining your chances at victory, you're probably not good enough to beat them in the first place.
---
How does it make it tryhard lool, its a proffession available for anyone
---
This
---
I still download them just incase if they turn paid or get removed.
---
&gt; only 98% of all PvP videos ever made.
---
And a 100% reason to remember the name
---
You know this is actually a pretty good idea.
---
Here comes another compilation of crits vs players who didn't want to fight in the first place :)
---
I used to play shred during Wotlk and loved it. Yes it's harder to play (you could either go shred or mangle build at that time) but the gameplay is just alot more fun. Also, I do mostly wild PvP in groups with a paladin and a rogue, that means half of the time my target is very unlikely to more around and dodge me.
---
I leveled EM and it worked for me at least 80% of the time. It helps to bind your shock to the scroll wheel and spam the wheel as you finish your cast.
---
It tells you whenever anyone is within target range. Even dead people that havent released.   
---
Nothing to do with if you have them in LOS. 
---
So you laying FD in a bush doesnt matter.  You are a player. Active or not.  
---
Further more.  Any player ‚Äùworth his salt‚Äù knows what FD if and will keep attacking a FD hunter. Sure it drops target/combat - but you are still - and always have been - attackable. 
---
Maybe im miss understanding you. Or maybe you dont fully understand how it works.
---
Jesus no, a stack would be upwards of ~1000g
---
Depending on server they're around 50g for one, give or take about 25g apparently
---
This addon makes world pvp way more enjoyable, and i couldnt care less about the stealth notification. The KOS list is the best part.
---
Lol no it's not.
---
Level 60s are awarded a dishonorable kill if they yank anyone below that level.
---
This is wrong. It will register from any buffs the character has on them. Even buffs you wouldn't even see on allies such as Battle Stance.
---
Sorry, but those wanting 'balance' and 'fairness' do not belong in classic wow at all.  Go back to retail where big mommy blizzard will rub your tushy and tell u everything is ok and fair in the world and make you buy her tokens for gold.
---
dude think of S2 league coming back. Shit would be crazy fun for a bit but i feel would die out.
---
I was a rogue in BC and it's just so hard to resist ganking people. You can turn invisible!
---
When I wasnt raiding or doing arenas I'd just sit on IQD all day and gank people doing dailies
---
A man of culture
---
Not really, combat swords and combat daggers are comparable in DPS. Pre-bis daggers are awful compared to pre-bis swords and using daggers in solo PVE is an overall worse experience, which is why we witness this crazy shit of people favoring swords.
---
Oh cool, just last night died 25 times in Arathi and thanks.
---
I‚Äôm at 38 right now (horde) and have a decent quest log, something like 15/20 spread across a few zones. Some in Desolace, Arathi, Alterac, as well as Scarlet Monastery, RFK, and Gnomer. For the most part I log on and just work from the easiest thing in my quest log until it‚Äôs asking me to kill mobs that are tough and/or slow fights then I go do something else, killing all the easy mobs that cross my path. I‚Äôm far from a speed leveler though and I‚Äôd say a good 75% of the time I‚Äôm not really considering XP/hour
---
Ya but I think the queue times will be worth it in a couple months. Fellow Pagle player here.
---
This is how most people think it works, but it's wrong.
---
Combat log at the moment reveals when someone enters vision range with buffs on them. The buffs don't have to be freshly applied, and they don't need to fade. The combat log will still generate entries for the buffs as if they were just applied.
---
And single alliance 60 can rack up dozens of kills on Horde 20s in Hillsbrad. A true display of skill.
---
Which doesn't mean that they shouldn't change their lazy stance on cheaty addons... If they can't find a way to disable them normally the least they can do is make them bannable. Also, this is the history of WoW Classic addons, they can change their stance from the broken retail game.
---
they dont
---
No
---
Maybe I will.. Dont assume that others do as you do..
---
Makes sense now. When doing the quest I could not find a wolf, and now whenever I walk in that area, there's wolves everywhere. Good to see I am not crazy, just lazy and should have killed them spiders.
---
open a ticket
---
You can detect players by simply keeping your combat log open and then /target them
---
Hit rating is still required, just less of it because your targets are never higher than level 60.
---
Rogues: "Stop trying to even the scales because we're so OP in pvp. We picked rogues so we could /be/ OP in pvp! Stop ruining our fun! boohoo qq"
---
What I mean is if a horde player has 3 lvl 60 characters, he skews the server population even if only one horde character from his account is ever active on the server.
---
&gt; But at least I'm a helpful person to MY side.
---
because standing in orgrimar yelling "I OP3N V0X3Z IM H4LP!N5" contributes more to a faction than mass mobility and consumables
---
He has great form.
---
[Here's the wowpedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Plainsrunning) article on it. There's some YouTube videos out there too.
---
I wasn't really talking about MC. I was talking about BWL, AQ40 and Naxx like OP mentioned. MC is faceroll with anything.
---
&gt; You aren't in the same argument as me. I'm telling someone to stop whining that they aren't going to get to be bis before phase 2. 
---
Huh? The person you replied to didn't mention anything regarding "bis before phase 2". Why are you suddenly moving the goalposts? The person was complaining that it would catch a lot of casuals before they reached level 60. 
---
&gt; One is how much he is playing
---
Where did he/she state that he/she is playing 2-3 hours per week? Those were your words. 
---
&gt; and the other is how much it would take to have reached 60.
---
But the person literally complained about not being able to reach level 60 in time while you are talking about obtaining bis for some reason? Why is that? 
---
Also, why did you mention wanting to be "ahead of the curve", when, in fact it wasn't mentioned at all? It seems you have a tendency to misrepresent what other people are writing. 
---
&gt; 2-3 hours per week were two completely different talking points.
---
Alright, the 2-3 hours per week were numbers you tried to accuse /u/Lunightz of playing. I simply questioned (indirectly I'll admit) how you came to the conclusion that the person only played 2-3 hours per week? 
---
I then listed a calculation that shows that's it's perfectly possible to not have reached level 60 despite having played more than 2-3 hours per week, meaning your numbers seem to have been pulled out of thin air and don't add anything to the discussion. 
---
&gt; and 10 hours per week were two completely different talking points.
---
Why even bring it up when the person was complaining about not reaching level 60 and didn't mention keeping up?
---
It depends on gear level, but for a pre raid BIS feral, it‚Äôs around 20%.
---
You can still hide, it doesnt detect you if you dont perform actions..
---
The drop rate on vulture gizzard is insane and there's like 4 vultures in the spot and this quest pops up multiple times and every spot has like 20 ppl fighting over 4 vultures trying to get 15 of a 1% drop ffs
---
Thats not how a/an works.
---
its a ufo because how the U is pronounced.
---
It's not a lie though.  If you actually played vanilla you would know this.
---
Top 200 is very generous for a low popularity spec so it seems reasonable for some parses without MCP to show up.
---
I'm not sure what the difference is, maybe 20-30%. Powershifting is more important, though it's currently bugged and doesn't reapply some buffs.
---
Fair enough, but not everything is on reddit/twitter/youtube. On SkullFlame-Eu we've had lots of fun wpvp fights vs Horde and I don't think they'll be on those sites tbh.
---
Yes but many people want to act like you can show up to a classic raid without researching tactics, without consumables, and without prebis and walk away without a challenge which isn't true. Of course to a guild properly preparing the content is gonna be easy but to your average player the raids are difficult. What % of the wow population actively clears heroic/mythic compared to LFR? The overwhelming majority of players fall into a more casual category and for them the content post BWL is challenging. There's a reason many guilds died on pservers once AQ dropped despite modern knowledge/computers/skill etc etc. I'd argue your average classic wow player is about as skilled as an LFR raider. The game just attracts a different kind of gamer.
---
*is if there‚Äôs like 20 alliance versus ~ 50 horde in a zone*
---
playing horde is picking the babymode of pvp.
---
Did someone beat you 1v1? better go 5v1 and take revenge.
---
people I know personally have gotten more than 1 in an hour. Like, two within 10-15 minutes of each other. its not always 1 hour, 1 per zone etc
---
Even without the addon you can detect players and player actions in the combat log
---
The only three things I can think of are:
---
That's an L, not an I.
---
Are you 100% sure that you've got Luna installed and not Shadowed Unit Frames or another similar-looking addon? 
---
Have you tried deleting the addon and redownloading whatever the latest version is?
---
I believe the mount animation was finally fixed with the new models in WoD.
---
By layering?
---
No level 60 alt with same level of gear? Filthy casual.
---
I'd say it entirely depends on the loot rules. Some raids allow anyone to roll if it's an upgrade. Some prioritise people who benefit the most. It can be unclear unless it's clarified beforehand. So best to ask the RL at the beginning.
---
Downvoted then upvoted
---
yep. i get devilsaurs between 6.5-8 min
---
Looks like Bartender
---
&gt; That would only be the case if you performed some action which shows in the combat log
---
Wrong. Combat log is bugged and generates entries for any existing buffs on the target as soon as you enter vision range.
---
Any advice on Black Lotus hunting?
---
At most you could make a triangle.
---
What a jerk :o good thing you won :)
---
Yes it's very nice and you can combo it with the cloaking device because stealth will be only broken after you finished casting it :D.
---
You also have to not have any buffs or stances active.   When you render in with a buff, the combat log will say "X gains Y" and the addon will pick it up
---
Have you played BFA? Zaldazar is 100x worse than Undercity. I understand why Horde is angry all the time now.
---
Tried warning them, even did the math to predict que times and how the economies would play out post layering.   No one believed me, they just shrugged it off and said "How could you know!" (Despite the math being right in front of their face).
---
Now they pay the piper while I to suffer the same issues because they all transfered to my server as a destination escape and overpopulated it post launch.   SMDH.   "HEY GUYS, TO MANY PEOPLE, WE NEED TO MOVE, THIS ONE SAYS FULL TOO LETS TRANSFER THERE AND HOPE ITS BETTER!"
---
Dumbasses....
---
Sent this post to the top! /cheer the pain is over!
---
Get a crowd pummeler mace from gnomer. Pop the on use. It has three charges per mace that increases attack speed by 50%.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
I once traded gold to my friend in retail and my account got locked (not banned) for suspicious activity. I had to reset my password, and that's about it.
---
I didn't say anything because I thought everyone could roll. However we do have 1 other dagger rogue who is usually our loot master but he didn't make it. He said he wouldn't have let them roll on it and it's making me sick lol
---
Hi guys! Apparently the "Timeworn Mace" from Dire Maul west is nowhere to be seen in the weapon list not matter what filter and research I use. However when I use the research bar at the top of the website it's found.
---
Not sure what's going on here :o  
---
thanks for your work!
---
If you leveled Retribution so far, you probably don't have much intel/+healing gear. One option is yo go holy and try to get dungeon group, which is pretty difficult. The other option is to go tank get 2 levels in Sunken Temple and then go spam BRD from 52 to 58, at start partial runs. There are spellcleave group that need a tank to pull and they like pala/druid tanks. From 58 you can start doing most dungeons as holy/tank in order to get the best dungeon gear for you.
---
I mean your a paladin, so you can't really talk. I would direct you to /NoFap to cure your porn addiction.
---
This thread again.
---
That's why I rolled a PvE server.
---
On the flip side of this, it's the best feeling ever to log in or come back afk to a RTV that dings an arcane crystal
---
yeah, at level 50, you'd be lucky to get half a bar running ZF. I mind it stopped for me when I did it.  
---
Maraudon is doable, too, and you get some good BiS gear in there, like the ring off the Princess, like the [Blackstone Ring](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17713/blackstone-ring). ST is good too, but I skipped it as not many groups run ST.   Better running mara over a few times, get to level 52-53 and head into BRD.
---
ST and Mara runs are good for a few levels
---
I mean what's up now, this is not a new thing invented in 2k19 it is, and was always present even back in the days. What is changed is communities of people who are sharing a lot of knowledge in so public and popular fashion. That led to ideas and projects (addons) which were so powerful. You are really crying about  addon that exsits for 10 years using so basic data available in the game. If you wanted to shut down Spy that would mean you would have to probably get rid of almost every addon using any ingame data that's not going to happen. Fyi Spy alone is 10+ years old and there were even other ways before.
---
This, I quest with my wife using Zygore, I‚Äôve found that while we were normally ahead of it thanks to ‚ÄúDungeon Friday‚Äù. If we ran into a series of kill count quests, we‚Äôd fall behind the level recommendation
---
true, for example I never asked mages for anything, not food, not portals, cooking and engineering takes care of those for me, no need to bother anyone
---
It has not.
---
He said "fucking".
---
If you are so childish to think he is salty for saying a word then you can fucking shut the fuck up.

Should only dispel magic, but you never know with all the bugs we've had.

Looking for a guild for my soon to be raiding warlock.  Currently 52.  Intent is to be 60 before next Wednesday and knock out my Pre-BIS.  Eastern Time, available Mon-Thursday evenings after 5.  Experience with classic through Legion, ex raid leader/guild leader.

Thanks for your interest!

Scholo ‚Äî‚Äî 58+

just did this as a warrior over the past 2 weeks, playing pretty casually
---
Just throwing out someone I remembered =)
---
What level u think they will invite you for diremaul? Im a lvl 55 paladin a bit tired og BRD (i got everything i need from there)
---
Wow, 64% of people are 60.  I think the pacing is entirely fine.
---
No, I don‚Äôt think so, more of we didn‚Äôt really think it out back then I guess
---
Here comes another over-edited compilation of crits vs players who didn't want to fight in the first place :)
---
You still haven't disproven me, yes it's a game, games can be optimized and, in my opinion, should. So again, why bring the obviously worse option when you have the option to not?
---
Sure we could clear MC with 10 boomkins, 5 elemental shamans and 5 enhancements, it's entirely possible, but it'll be so much slower it's absolutely stupid to do.
---
And bring the boomkin? Why should the rogue bother with wbuffs and full consumes, we're fine with bringing a boomkin afterall so why should he minmax? Bringing the meme-specs is opening a can of worms that shouldn't be opened if you at all care for efficiency.
---
You play for fun, you do you, but realize not everyone shares your fucking values of the laser chicken being fun, and don't torture the rest of us because you want to be a snowflake.
---
It doesnt
---
In 2004? 
---
I remember it working differently
---
what would have been the right way to write it ?
---
Hypnotic blade is pretty solid for the level, and it's super easy to get. I used one too
---
False. Using the TSM add on will not result in a ban. Automating it through additional software may.
---
none at all. There is nothing wrong with trading gold, even high volumes. I've done it with my brother several times. 
---
They can easily check where the gold came from by looking at your char screen and seeing the gold accumulate. 
---
Also, blue posts have confirmed trading retail gold for classic gold is allowed, but its up to players to take the risk. they will not chase any scams this way.
---
It doesn't ruin the game, you guys still gank me, just not nearly as much. When you look at things from a single perspective you don't have a chance to consider how fun the game is for *everyone*. There's a lot of classes that can do absolutely nothing about you coming at them, they deserve a chance to hide.
---
I play both rogue and warrior, I can appreciate and respect both sides of this argument, but ultimately if people have a slight heads up I'm coming it doesn't 100% work because if I look hard enough I can still find people.
---
You just have to hunt more, and for how easy rogues gank it's quite deserving.
---
This sub and wow in gen is dominated by elites jobless pricks. This is the vocal majority at least. Rag in 3 months is extremely fast for MOST non jobless losers. Good job dude!
---
Thank you for confirming you were incorrect and spouting baseless claims as if they were facts.
---
Start on BRD as soon as possible. While I dont know Tankadin gear, i had a ton of stuff to get from there as a priest and theres bound to be some hard to get items for you as well.
---
All this says is that you barely played retail
---
Alliance &gt; horde 
---
Paladins &gt; shamans
---
Don‚Äôt deny the facts.
---
Tank tank heal tank stab cast BLESSING OF KINGS.....
---
Thats a neat trick :D 
---
- another shadowpriest
---
I never knew about this addon until I saw all the threads about it, mostly from rogues. I didn't have it installed until now, but rogues are assholes in the game and anything that makes them cry makes me happy.
---
I played in 2005 with engineering and it did not remove you from combat then. Mobs largely ignored the effect, and this was a PvP item. I guess it slip under their tester's checks, so you got a bit of extra functionality for a while.
---
Your\*
---
Nice clips and editing. 
---
Just this sub being this sub I guess.
---
What is COR?\^
---
Cool thanks :)
---
you get stealth notifications ALL THE TIME, you stop giving a crap about them. You cant be alert every single time a rogue stealths to kill a random mob :D
---
Can someone explain how honor works for phase 2?
---
If I‚Äôm level 40, what‚Äôs the highest level that can kill me or I can kill to get honor points? And on a similar note, what‚Äôs the lowest level I can kill to get honor points?
---
And what happens when I kill someone who‚Äôs level 1 if I‚Äôm level 60?
---
Dishonorable kill= NPC kill. For killing below 48 you just don't get any honor.
---
Try to spam Entangling Roots Rank 1, if he keeps shifting, he will be oom pretty quickly.
---
Best case you can snatch a quick drink while he goes oom.
---
They don't, fire mage does more dps on all the MC bosses that aren't immune to fire (geddon and rag) as far as I'm aware.
---
they isn't
---
It matters a lot in pvp, it‚Äòs not like ‚Äûgood‚Äú people always have a choice. You also forgot to mention warlocks... try to get a fear off with BT on you
---
Also they can easily wait like 30 seconds and the player is gonna assume its just a rogue killing a mob.
---
Agree. Played all of Vanilla and mostly PvP'd. Spy type addons were not widely used at all.
---
I say show his name and server so other's don't end up wasting their time with this guy.
---
At 40 they should be sweeping strikes whirlwinding for agro, which should be enough to hold off the healer, then going d-stance cleave while tanking with a 2h.
---
They track "unbalanced" trades (this includes both direct trades, and AH purchases) and if someone is noticed frequently trading away large amounts of gold, they will be looking into it. If it's a one time thing it should be harmless.
---
I did?
---
This is nothing new, servers handled it even worse 14 years ago and we were perfectly fine.
---
How are people not 60? Even if you can only play 1-2 hours a night you should be 60 by now.
---
Seriously tho, u r trying to say those raids gonna be "hard" by saying they might take an hour longer than MC on farm and little to no time to "progress" them?
---
And yeah, i took in mind classic populatis and thus increased time for first walkthrough in classic with "dads" etc. B
---
By saying "hard" all i meant was "a bit longer". There's literally no challenge or really hard mechanics, the hardest mechanic is to get 4 tanks with taunts for horsemen.
---
Suddenly I'm glad I rolled on a pve server this time.
---
Except for the portion of players that could afford a moderately powerful mid-range gaming PC and played the game on max settings, i.e. everyone I knew.
---
If it isn't, it is now
---
&gt; Its making your lives easier for a core part of PVP in classic wow.
---
Its also making it way more fun. I love the KOS list and the fact that it tracks your win / loss against a player.
---
Same....but those couple of mages have killed every single basilisk and vulture on the map.
---
also, they are
---
You can do dme at 55.
---
Witch hunts are against subreddit rules.
---
&gt; Anyone who defends this addon is essentially a Retail LFG player, except it's worse than LFG.
---
I don't defend the addon, but this is what is wrong with the world. Next, are they Nazis? Pedos? You're assigning a classification which is completely black and white, when there is a lot more to it.
---
You don't seem smart enough honestly to be looking at the combat log constantly for 40 man raids in your primary city in the middle of the night.
---
They cant target you in stealth...
---
right, seems like Spy is here to stay
---
This is true if you have a tank buddy. If you dont you spend a ton of time lfg.
---
It's a great site, if you make your own stat weights. Some stat weights for some classes are decent (shadow priest, for example), some are not so good. 
---
The site in general, though, is absolutely terrific for planning gear.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed my first day on this server
---
Feral druid from BC onwards has literally nothing to do with feral in vanilla, feral in vanilla is literally the same druid as every other specc except about 20-30% more damage. Feral past BC is an actual slightly inferior rogue with slightly better utility.
---
But yes, if you gank stuff, it literally doesn't matter, therefore your build still doesn't really matter. If you wanna fight larger groups than you 3, you shouldn't be going shred at all because it will force you into catform longer, making you less useful.
---
Wait do people really not understand when they by product, overhead and cost of materials are factored into the price?
---
He is right, if you stealth from further away, the addon doesnt detect it, so what are you on about?
---
Yeah and I heard that there's a ton of secret menu items on McDonalds that employees know about but won't tell you unless you ask. I haven't bothered to actually check for myself though, but I'll assume it's the truth for the sake of making an argument.
---
Actually the one I replied with, Allies would see "okzoomr" if a horde player did it in orcish.
---
I like the taste of Linux more...
---
Paladins have very good threat generation with g.blessing spam, but once they run out of mana they become useless.
---
Kurinaxx? We had 4-5 full raid groups (Alliance - and the best guilds too) and somehow the word got out and the Horde was ready when we got there.. there numbers were too many and we got stumped quick. It wasn‚Äôt fun and it couldn‚Äôt have been that much fun for the Horde either. The faction imbalance is terrible. The lag was bad but the terrible odds just made us abandon the idea. there will never be a raid of this size ever again because of DKs and due to the faction Imbalance it was over in 20 mins. 
---
Now blizzard wants to open character migration. Think of the alliance that are gonna leave. creating more faction Imbalance.
---
Servers are going to become real unplayable and real annoying.
---
Please tweet Blizz devs for Faction Based Character transfers!!!
---
Wait, you are buying FR Potions as a tank? The ones that absorb 2500 fire damage?
---
Also, yellow crystals, like for dynamte? So you are not an engineer? What bosses do you even use dynamite on? The only point where I blew goblin sapper charges is if noone has ae taunt @ imps and sometimes a dynamite @ the corehounds
---
Warsong tabard please.
---
Nah, PvP BiS gear setup is super easy. Just stack int/stam.
---
I agree, but "hope my opponent is bad" isn't the mage that we're talking about. The fact is that a mage with 3800 health can reset the fight after those major CDs.
---
Typed-talleane beat me to it - you are wrong as to why it's "a" rather than "an". 
---
But please, do go on waving that flag - good job on you.
---
Wow so much anger. You're obviously a min/max'er and can't consider anything else.(very typical of your type). I get it, it's the way you like to play. There are guilds that are perfectly fine clearing MC in 5 hours and maybe even TWO nights! The horror!  
---
P.S. I don't and never have played Boomkin. 
---
(note: if your "rogue" is running full consumables, MC isn't as easy as you claim, at least for your guild)
---
banks, I'm guessing
---
No, it's the group of people who want some of the worst features from retail to enter Classic which is how retail got to where it is now in the first place......
---
Well I got uncertain now - a group clears a path that anyone can follow to get the tribute, but if it's hunter maybe you need stealth.
---
You need to have it equipped.
---
Some of the addons for multi-boxing will do this. Check out dual-boxing.com
---
How is pvp the endgame of wow? Does it flesh out or add to the current or overall storyline? How is it endgame on a pve server?
---
IMO, it's not endgame, just filler. Raiding is endgame and adds content/story.
---
They do not, they just don't award an honourable one. Only NPCs marked as Civilians award DHKs.
---
Some people just have punchable faces
---
I cant believe people are dumb enough to say "they camped me for an hour, that's griefing" like wtf why did you keep dying to them for an hour. Log onto an alt or take rez sickness and run and hide.
---
You can target a player from combat log with a /target command / macro
---
we raided major cities all the times with 2-3 raids and we didnt have 20 seconds freeze for the entire city. sure it was a bit laggy but nothing close to this.

Good to know

you can jump out, you just have to jump at the corners. I have been in this exact chimney a few times. Just get good
---
Yes, and it will, because it's a log that is affecting your character, or one of your allies.
---
yes i buy my FR potions.
---
Yes the crystals for explosions, I admit I use those during UBRS for pack agro, not in MC.
---
No one was offering you.
---
same
---
You know you won't.
---
How does it NOT go against game integrity where you can literally fucking invalidate a huge aspect of a class? That's not being a purist, that's using your damn brain.
---
You do not have the gear required to make fury/prot viable.
---
Bottom picture should be a /LookingForGroup call for your exact class, last spot, for the dungeon you still need a BiS from.
---
It's quite normal for hardcore gold farmers.
---
Alliance is like a basic bitch. Horde is like a dirty slut. Horde &gt; Alliance.

Paladins are for porn addicts. Shamans are for Avatar the Last Airbender addicts. Shaman &gt; Paladin.

And that‚Äôs fine for me. I‚Äôm part of a casual guild but like in vanilla, I want to be amazed to see a character with a dark age of insanity and a full t2.5 set even if he will 2 shoot me because I don‚Äôt have the same gear level.

Too guild, top rewards, casual guild, casual rewards, that‚Äôs wow classic.

Good to know, ZF here I come xD

https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/will-there-be-a-rank-14-week-one/102747/5
---
By that logic every add-on should be forbidden that provides information. It's just rogues crying because having an infinite stunlock isn't enough for them
---
Sure, remove consent for your client to send things to the WoW servers, and in effect, other players' clients. 
---
You can actually do this already. If you go into the Windows Firewall settings and deny all network connections for wow.exe you've removed the ability for someone to collect the actions of your character in the game.
---
It will have a side effect of not being able to log in or play whatsoever though, but it will work.
---
I'm not here to offer a solution, I don't have the knowledge about the game's code or how addon works, on a technical level. 
---
I am just voicing my concerns about the addon. If Blizzard can do anything about this specific typ of addons - great! 
---
If not, its not like I will stop playing.
---
If I didn‚Äôt know any better, this post would‚Äôve been mistaken for a piece from The Onion.
---
‚ÄúWhere shall my blood be spilled?‚Äù
---
Gotta rp it bro! You slashed/burnt/melted that shit.
---
Basically this but BGs even earlier.  Probably 1/3 of the way through the phase rather than 2/3's like DM was.
---
... except they excplicitly named simplicity
---
The materials to do that enchant likely cost about 2 gold, depending on material costs on your AH. He basically paid you a gold to enchant your gear. 
---
If you want to check the cost of an enchant, you can Google the recipe, see the materials, and look at the AH. Or you can ask what the mats are and check AH.
---
That being said, while leveling enchanting, I give enchants away for free so someone tipping 1g is a plus for me. If he was leveling enchanting he was probably happy to get the 1 gold.
---
Yep they are going to probably change targets to keep aggro off heals or stay safe for multishots and accidents, so when they say target my target that's where the confusion comes in is what I'm saying
---
Lol
---
You know why it didn‚Äôt work? I didn‚Äôt move the macro to my ability bar.
---
You can put 25 agi on maul too. Basically it‚Äôs sharpening stone vs the stat difference.
---
&gt; drillbore disk
---
raid boss though
---
You can configure it to include gear from raids, or exclude it. 
---
Only real issue I have found is that quite a bit of gear (for priests at least) is missing from DM.
---
Naxx boes?
---
this is the problem with all addons.. they ruin everything, but eventually everyone just has to get them because everyone else has them.. Even some addons that are just like, convenience things.
---
Servers handled it better back in the day, which is shocking.
---
Too late...
---
nice, just shitting on someone for playing the game.. why the fuck are you even following this subreddit, just to troll and bitch? fuck out of here loser.
---
Well by blizzards own admittion a medium pop. server by today's metric would be a full server by vanillas metric.
---
So in all honesty you are probably playing way more closely to how the game is meant to be played than anyone on the mega servers.
---
Further more by the time these servers "die" transfers will become available and you can move to the fuller servers.... so really play somewhere healthy now, no lag, no que, good economy... move later when and IF it dies. And that's a big if.....
---
I am happy questing still but there are multiple 60s patrolling almost every zone now so if I want to level up more I am kinda forced into dungeons xD.
---
&gt; Just like your health and mana bars. People shouldn't get those spoon-fed with pretty bars. Let's get rid of all the combat UI stuff and just watch the combat log. That's the only way to be absolutely fair.
---
That's such a terrible analogy. One is a base feature of the game (Mana/HP presentation), the other is a gross simplification of a base feature (text-based report system). Why would you even consider those two to be comparable?
---

---
I used this one. It under-shot a bit on a couple of the green recipe ones because I had bad luck, but I'd rather undershoot than overshoot from a cost perspective.
---
K bye
---
i hit 36 today... hope to get 37 maybe ... 42 by the 14th ...
---
P3 won't come early, but I do believe they'll put up one BG (WSG, prolly) after 2-3 weeks or so.
---
This is what I used, it undershot a bit on the green crafts, but overall there was very minimal waste.
---
I'm only 39. I started playing 6-7 weeks ago, don't have a lot of time to play, and I'm purposely not rushing anything. The leveling experience is the game for me basically. My schedule is so hectic and unpredictable that I doubt I'll be able to raid any and I have no desire to do pvp so the climb to 60 will likely be it for me.
---
Man you're very adamant about your borderline wallhack being kept in the game. Almost like some people got a real vested interest in keeping it around as a crutch.
---
Spy add-on = bitch mode.
---
Wait, I didn‚Äôt knew counterweights were working! But why can‚Äôt they be used on staff? Is this a limitation to the type of weapon?
---
Pretty sure this is still like this in retail. At least it was when I leveled my tauren pally in legion.
---
What's missing? I'm using it extensively to theorycraft different sets of gear for my priest.
---
you're not willing to debate that?
---
Meanwhile after 8/10, 9/10 then 5 full clears we‚Äôve seen zero 1H swords and no 2hand weps except vendorstrike and Earthshaker, no ingots let alone an eye haha and ofc no bindings. We have a second group that is doing it‚Äôs 3rd 10/10 tomorrow and that group also has seen nothing exciting but 1 Eskhanders Paw and Staff of Dom.
---
RNG hates us.
---
Best drop we‚Äôve had is 1 Band of Accuria, 1 Mageblade and 1 Drillborer‚Äôs Disk.
---
Undead frost mage.
---
Our sounds perfect. Thank you!
---
&gt; 58 last night, about 79% to 60 
---
So... you mean 59?
---
Is that sentence also available in english?
---
In classic? I find that unlikely since they have stated multiple times that they won‚Äôt
---
Chain heal, shaman only
---
Although depressing or  ¬®unexciting¬® it's kinda just honest. My original account that I played on for mostly between 2007-2011 and have returned to on occasion hardly exists.
---
Every single ridiculously insane challenge and achievement is now achievable in a couple of minutes. Mounts like Black proto drake or Zulian tiger t hat were once considered super nice, now are 99% bought via Black AH by pulling out the wallet.
---
I do.
---
Your correct let me edit that!
---
Point is I'm comparing it with a item that is bis until last boss in AQ40. If a upgrade drops in mc already I would consider it much worse.
---
Yeh but then you can essentially stunlock someone for 20 seconds if you get a little lucky and they're not undead, so it evens out.
---
lol what tasty reply
---
Not in the same layer in the same zone. I farm Silithus all the time (4-7 lotuses per day), and respawn times are consistently between 45mins and 1h15mins
---
I suspect it removes all custom channel messages. But most people don't use those anyway.
---
I fully expect BGs to come out by mid-December.
---
It isn't just the world pvp instability issue, but the reality of world pvp being kind of tedious.  There is also the issue of PvE servers which get basically nothing from Phase 2 other than DM (It was released early) and Kazzak/Azuregos.
---
At the same time I also expect the rest of Phase 3 entirely to be out by February.  Phase 2 really isn't adding much.  Bgs are going to come earlier, but there are still a lot of people raiding.  Perhaps blizzard didn't realize how fast people would clear MC, but they should have.  Having an instance like MC to carry the raiding for like 5 months is going to be terrible.  BGs coming early can counter some of it, but they need to keep people involved.
---
i dont follow
---
No, they shouldn't struggle. But I'd rather deal with a squishy blender than a rock that can't hold aggro or do DPS when it comes to bad tanks.
---
I'm on the brink of leaving. Still hesitating.
---
The reason I started playing wow classic was only because I want to be main tank in raids.
---
Unfortunately, I started 1 week late because I had a full IRL life to deal with, then I didn't take days off to level in wow and instead leveled very slowly only playing evenings and some weekends.
---
When my war finally reached 60, I realized all raids already had their MT, and MT2, and 3 and even 4.
---
I ended up in a guild, being the Nth tank, they sometime give me the first mc boss to tank, but mostly I'm here to tank one of majordomo's adds, and the rest of the time I try to dps with my 17/3/31 spec.
---
As the nth tank, the healer's lead assigned me a lvl 56 priest, now finally 60, but still I die a lot.
---
This makes me want to quit, I have no agency over anything, I see them doing piss poor strats, like not pairing the tank with someone during ony p2 and then always having ony whipe half the raid on landing in p3.
---
I do what I can to advise changes, post videos of tutorials on the discord, all of that gets ignored and I don't even get a reply. We continue to play badly, and I continue to exist solely to tank 1 add in majordomo, and follow along the rest of the time.
---
recklessness yes
---
&gt; They aren't going to do such a massive overhaul for one mod.
---
So your entire argument is "It's difficult so blizzard is literally incapable of doing it, even if it's a game ruining effect." 
---
&gt; Anyone who thinks this can be banned, or that it is somehow 'easily fixed' have no idea how the LUA system works within WoW.
---
Do you? Are you a Software Dev at blizz, now or before? You're just talking out of your ass as much as anyone else here.
---
Reminds me of collecting all underwater treasure in Skellige.
---
They hated him because he spoke the truth.
---
I guess we'll simply try, or can anyone confirm this?
---
NO CHANGES!!!!!
---
If you get 15 kills each week for 12 weeks you will still be the lowest rank possible after 12 weeks.
---
Idk, I rarely see people going out for any dungeons besides high level ones like strat, scholo, dm, or l/ubrs on my server.  I definitely thing there are at least 60% people at level 60.
---
I swapped from faerlina to Kurinaxx after day 1 and I'm so glad I did even though I had thrown away the first 15 levels of progress the night before.
---
Kurinaxx is great. No wait times but still very busy every day. It might be slightly skewed horde but if I'm guessing it's 60-40 max.
---
I second this. It's more useful than any of the other daily threads.
---
Also people who defend spy addons are 1. insecure about pvp and 2. are bitches.
---
My advice: increase your tab target range with a console command and have kos names ready to spell out, like a real pvp player.

Any chance to see you gear and talent tree? I just switched to a off spec ele after being resto for my guild, so haven‚Äôt gotten any big ele gear.

This mean rice just focused on getting crit and stam rather than spell damage on gear.
---
Is nature‚Äôs Swiftness alright for this kinda setup?
---
Another  PCMR OG then, I approve.
---
I would have Thunder Bluff as my main city, but there isn't a warlock trainer there. It will be my main city after I get to 60.
---
To be fair it was never the 12th but they explicitly stated the "week of the 12th" which means anywhere from 11th to 17th
---
They find out you‚Äôre coming and hide.
---
I hope so. BG's are life. World pvp is fun but BG's are where my heart lies.
---
Spy is not a retail feature. If you want that functionality on retail you have to download the addon there too, same as classic. You're going off the rails here mate.
---
&gt;which is how retail got to where it is now in the first place......
---
99% of the problems with retail are game design choices coming directly from Blizzard and were not created by the community. I don't like Spy for the same reasons as you, but this childish name calling doesn't help with anything.
---
Oh yeah, I can follow you too...
---
Yeah, they are ano defined by their elegenitals.
---
In my guild in vanilla, flasks were expected for caster DPS in AQ40/Naxx because supreme power's 150 bonus absolutely could make or break gearcheck encounters. The resistance/mana flasks were less important but I always had to bring at least one flask for progression raids.
---
You do not own the data, it's Blizzard's data, so you cannot give consent for its use. If data consent was required 3rd parties would need to go to Blizzard directly, you have no input.
---
&gt; You can't reduce the range, either, otherwise, WarcraftLogs/Details may become a lot less dependable for certain fights where players are very spread out (e.g Ragnaros).
---
Actually they could reduce the range, just have details addons talk to each other to share parsed information that's out of range on spread out fights.
---
I dont play a stealth class but I totally agree, it ruins A LOT of the fun and some funny tactics, impossible to "hide" in cool places. And worst part is that you kinda need to have it else the opponent army will just have to much advantage..
---
Mage. No comparison.
---
That's because everyone is killing them and leaving everything else alive. Gotta kill the other mobs to have a chance of wolf respawn.
---
Imagine lmao
---
Oh get off your high horse and take off your nostalgia googles.
---
Addons are a part of WoW since Vanilla. Back in Vanilla there were even more powerful and game breaking addons around. The only difference today is, that the community had 15 years to get used to addons providing a significant quality of life increase and such a lot more people use it and have easy access to them. And the programmers had 15 years to improve their addon writing and designing.
---
Want WoW without addons who "dumb the game down"? Go ahead. But then it certainly won't be even close to WoW Vanilla anymore.
---
Does it seriously surprise you, that WoW Classic won't feel the exact same as Vanilla? Of course it won't. We've had 15 years to get used to the game. Private servers alone have changed a lot of how the game is played since those people had years to train for WoW Classic.
---
2w hit cap is 24%
---
"Hi I totally know everything about software development, but adding code to modify functionality of an API is ***literally impossible*** and you're an *idiot* if you think a team of software devs can modify the data parsed through their API."
---
\- Totally real genius who totally isn't just desperately coping with the fact they're gonna lose their wallhack.
---
So do that a couple times and then keep running with the same tanks?
---
Every player without stealth wants it.
---
Rogues and Druids ... well ... sucks for you ;)
---
Incorrect. For a warrior, for example, even being in a stance gives a "X gain X Stance" whenever you become in render distance.
---
Why cant you bring the questgiver like blood from some random mob, hows that idiot gonna know the difference?
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. A hunter will solo it and sell the run to warriors, etc. who will wait at the entrance for it.
---
I'm a priest? :c
---
&gt; Blizzard is not going to let people progress through classic with their characters putting in hundreds of days of work only to have everyone start at level 1 like private servers do. 
---
Why not? A fresh server economy / Levelling was amazing to participate in. By the time TBC classic comes out, I'd probably be fine with rerolling.
---
What‚Äôs the context to this pic, and please tell me the dog made it out safe
---
Well, UD racial kinda counters half of the available long CC
---
guess I am smart enough to not lower myself on your level of commenting and insulting people. 
---
obviously - in my subjective view - the addon is not too big of a problem as it is for some others - no problem with that and no need to insult people who think differently!
---
so I hope you have a nice day!
---
I'm sure you know about it but some servers use "LFG" while others use "lookingforgorup". 
---
The LFG on mine is mostly dead but it always has been. The lookingforgroup is an endless steam or people asking/making groups. And mine is a medium server. (Maybe on the low end of medium.)
---
It's a game from 2005 dude, it'll run on any laptop.
---
Yup Gehennas is biggest realm on EU and tomorow is gonna be even more crazy no more layers and phase 2 :)
---
Sure am glad to be a level 50 horde on Heartseeker right now........
---
I searched a few people of my guild and found them all.
---
Have you ever seen the logs?
---
man you are really adamant about removing it, when VirtualFormal gives you the real reason it will never be removed.
---
That is exactly how
---
I simply dont expect you to tip, but if you do ill try to remember your name
---
You can solo Maraudon at 57 in quest gear? I assume Rotgrip not included?
---
There is so much anti rogue bias that its disgusting. F these ppl, how would they like if their class would be countered by one addon
---
I only found out about it 2 weeks ago. And only because I specifically searched for something like it.
---
Ah, just make sure it has a dedicated GPU instead of just integrated graphics. Should run fine then.
---
The presets are very hit and miss. There's two things to keep in mind when using them:
---
- They apply only to the most standard, straight-forward PvE play
---
- They assume you're using the most common cookie-cutter spec
---
So if you're trying to gear for PvP, for example, the presets are almost completely useless. It might tell a mage that one crit is worth just 8 spell power, and that intellect is practically worthless. It won't take stamina into account at all. It'll only be valid for the express purpose of raid DPS.
---
For PvP, leveling, farming or anything other than the cookie-cutter endgame PvE role, the presets should be taken with a huge grain of salt. It tends to massively overvalue things like spell power or healing or whatever is the primary stat for your spec, to the point where it'll think the best item is a green 'of frozen wrath' with 36 spell power when there's a blue in that slot with 34 spell power and 10 int 10 stam.
---
I think they should just break all mods, I think It would interesting to play the game without help again
---
I agree. Add ons should not automate basic player actions like seeing something on the screen. 
---
I don‚Äôt like add ons at all to be honest I wish there were add on free realms. 
---
If you want questie or bagnon or something like that fine, it doesn‚Äôt impact other players. But stuff like spy is rediculous.
---
Yeah I beg to differ... guilds on my server are constantly hosting pvp events on non-raid days. As alliance we had a day we took over all the Zeppelins was fun.... 
---
Sure they have dueling tourney and stuff but who fucking cares. SL warlock or Shadowpriest is always going to win. Big surprise there.
---
Why scorch over 2 wand hits?
---
OmniCC shows it.
---
They did. There was a macro script you could run for the first few weeks of Classic and they killed it.
---
That's the spirit, just perpetuate the problem. The wow community way.
---
lol as if allys don't do the exact same thing.  Land in light's hope, see 6 alliance camping the flight point and quest turn in npcs with a rogue or hunter kiting away the guards.
---
Same here, used it successfully several times last week. Does not work anymore, also seem to get way more fd resists
---
58 trying to push into 60 before the bs
---
probably needed on it over a rogue because it was purple.
---
Am only 40 on my main. Am I fucked?
---
I'm genuinely interested in all you wrote and it's clear you're more experienced in the addon fields, so thank you in advance for your inside peek about what is spinning under the hood.
---
But it seems you're pretty arrogant in your stance and just because you know how some addons work you can talk about the TOS politic like a Blizzard rep.
---
What all of this have to do with the fact that Blizzard could say that an addon breaks the TOS if Blizzard decide so?
---
The fact that it's using an accepted default feature of the combat log has nothing to do with what an addon can do and there are already previous proven cases about this.
---
You go on saying that a simple script could do the same, it just means that maybe 0.1% of the server population could manage to exploit the addon ban and risk to be banned to have a simplified and broken version of the addon, I'm not sure where are you going with this fact. Same would happen with another addon that does the same function. 
---
Also, out of curiosity I looked on the net and Blizzard can definitely know about your installed addons, and they already gave custom messages to players that had installed forbidden addons, so not sure how you got that information.
---
You said that it would bring more of a challenge, not simply just a matter of enjoyment. Perhaps you should be reading your own comments before coming up with gibberish.
---
Also you're 3 days late, try to respond on time instead of digging up old posts to troll with your poorly constructed blathering.
---
Just cos you type a lot doesn‚Äôt make you smart.
---
He literally just told you.
---
Moron
---
&gt;but they have the fatal flaw that they don't have a taunt
---
Lack of taunt is not the fatal flaw for Paladin tanking. The main problem is the mana bar.
---
Tanking is a Paladin is a challenge in mana management. Without good gear, a Tankadin will have to drink or sacrifice some threat. Down ranking is also important. Max rank Consecration is great threat, but drains your mana.
---
Something like /castsequence reset=15 Serpetnsting ?
---
Two nights ago I encountered an enemy elite in Desolace and he followed me, both of us on mounts, across the entire region. The guy literally dedicated 20 minutes to the chance to gank a stranger.
---
There was an update recently, I haven't downloaded it and don't have this feature. You may be due for an update.
---
There were similar add-ons in Vanilla so idk how this has changed. You can still hide inside buildings, it just scans your combat log and puts hostiles on the list it detects. Same thing it did in vanilla wow for stealth. There was an add-on that scanned and displayed when targets stealthed so this really isn't something new.
---
[It literally has lol.](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/45396-classic-lfg-addon-to-be-limited-by-blizzard/)
---
What is with people on the internet and just like, saying flat out lies that are easily refuted by a simple google search. Do you think we're too stupid to do it?
---
It ain't be like it is
---
gotta crush the galic for that allicin
---
How do you get your hearthstone back?
---
&gt; Most of the popular addon give you an advantage over people not using them though.
---
No, they really don't. 
---
&gt; Boss mods,
---
They give you an advantage over PvE bosses, not players. 
---
&gt; cooldown timers, auto attack timer, resource tick timer
---
But I think there is a distinct difference in the amount of simplification being done. Most of those things are things that  are pretty trivial to keep in mind, whereas the mass of data being compiled from the combat log and spoonfed directly to you via Spy is an entirely different beast. I can pretty easily keep track of a couple of cooldowns in a fight, but it's much harder to differentiate the important information from the massive bloat of text in the combat log in active battles. At least that's my opinion.
---
more frequently? seems like every day a new "BAN Spy" / "Remove Spy ADDON" pops up every 2 days at least in new. Mostly butthurt Rogues who lose in PVP and blame it on the addon.
---
A good ret?  Why would anyone good be that bad at selecting a build?
---
I played and raided in wotlk on a 400 laptop, pretty sure classic would run way better lol plus there is so many different setting you can turn down
---
I'm on a super low pop server. Where is the best route to farm black lotus in silithus? Have any good links?
---
The old things measured total online population. The new one uses raiders that are logged.
---
So only level 60 players who are taking part in endgame content are in it. And of those maybe 1/4 or 1/2.
---
Still didn't answer my question.
---
Illusion of a fix, if you look at server pops 90% of all servers are horde-favored. That means no matter if most hordes transfer, imbalance will remain just because of the critical mass of hordes in general.
---
Sadly nochanges didn't account for the millions of people who were told horde is just better.
---
What server is this?
---
Was literally just at an Org raid where the horde got completely shit on.
---
If you want to try to salvage your experience without paying for another laptop, playing at a lower resolution than your screeen's default will help a lot.
---
Harsh reality from someone who gave up marking anything short of a guild run:
---
Even if the only thing you Mark is a skull as a kill this dick first.  It will be the last to die in 75% of the pugs I‚Äôve had to deal with.
---
Find out when one gets picked and circle the spots 45-75 mins afterwards. Add everyone you see picking, and when the "regulars" leave the zone it's likely they found one, so you can restart your timer.
---
Ya this is a perfectly reasonable middle ground.
---
But blizzard would need to automatically copy all characters from a certain point or else you could just trade all your gold to each char before you copy them and essentially duplicate gold during the transfer process.
---
Believe it or not, many people are playing Classic to immerse themselves in the game world and the social interactions it enables, and not to speedrun the game in spell AoE dungeon farms then shit on people that are actually enjoying themselves once you've burned yourself out in 2 weeks.
---
Stop trying. These kids want to ruin classic with their retail mindset and there's just no convincing them otherwise. They'll crash and burn this game just like retail and be completely dumbfounded at why it's dead in two years.
---
Yes.  And why consumable prices skyrocket on the AH.
---
Nah, that was on a na server
---
buy them all and save for p3 p4 p5 and youll make bank
---
Our guild downed him last week for the first time as well and had the sons spawn. However, I think we were more heavy on heals vs. dps. 
---
Most of us prioritized FR (which checking the logs seemed to have helped immensely). Even with the sons spawn it was a remarkably smooth one-shot on him. I think only one or two people died.
---
You're a condecending little shit with a very limited perspective, might be due to a lack of intelligence, might be because of laziness.
---
Now *that's* angry, I was perfectly calm before, check your initial message btw for passive aggressive shit, Pot meet the fucking kettle.
---
Oh WHY would the rogue run full consumables? Surely it is because Lucifron's enrage timer is simply so fucking tight we need every little bit of DPS we can squeeze out.
---
OR PERHAPS it's because 5 hours in MC is a fucking horror, that is a shitshow raid, hell 2 hours is a bad raid for us, and THAT is why we use consumables. Because we're in our 30's now, and we can't raid 4 nights a week when all raids are released, we'll stick to 2 days even in Naxx while clearing all content, and that REQUIRES our type of mentality.
---
Broaden your fucking perspective, think outside of your own very limited life, and try to put yourself in the shoes of someone else, rather than taking your own mentality into a different scenario.
---
I am playing on two accounts for the first time and also encountered this problem and couldn't find a simple fix. Throw us an update if you find a solution!
---
Going Hard, 54 now, could be worse
---
ST, Mara or BRD
---
i hope your ugly drawings will stop, not even that funny though, tooo....
---
Thats not how quote's work.
---
Hey I was able to get out of this chimney as a female troll! Not sure if that matters or not but there is a way.
---
If you‚Äôre going to spend a grand there are some nice MSIs out there for around $800
---
Talk to any innkeeper, and you will get a new hearthstone when you set your hearth
---
Just because it existed in vanilla does not mean it's not a fucking stupid addon.With so much of the endgame content revolving around wpvp this takes the need of spatial awareness away and replaced it with an automated system that can pay attention for you. Pretty much makes it so you have to use it to be competitive because everyone else is using it. If you are facing the opposite way of my character who is inside a building and know exactly where I am that's stupid. We all came to classic to experience a more immersive mmo world and spy certainly detracts from that world.
---
I tried it this weekend and couldn't keep above 30fps consistently. It's because it uses a newer engine. I can run a vanilla private server client at a solid 60fps but no matter how I tweaked the setting I couldn't get the Classic client it to play without being choppy.
---
Fucking based tho.
---
You quit. Bye
---
What‚Äôs laughable is actually thinking Blizzard would ban someone for using an add on like that.
---
&gt; You shouldve just picked up a Krol Blade from the auction house, like me. Only took me 30 seconds.
---
- World of Roguecraft, 2006
---
(Sorry, just reminded me of that quote lol)
---
You need an addon like Clique for it to work.  https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/clique
---
Always has been in the game and weakaura could do the same thing. Just suck it up it isnt gonna change.
---
I use gathermate with everything filtered except lotus. There's another lotus spawn in Hive'zora (check wowhead), and I usually don't bother checking the northwest spawn at elementals because essence farmers are always up there
---
It's quite hard to farm gold right now, next to impossible. You can chill on 50ish humanoids, the runecloth should net you ok profits.
---
&gt; He's not advocating for it to remain in the game, he's explaining why there's no way for Blizzard to remove it.
---
Except he didn't do that at all. He even admitted in this very comment chain that there is a way for them to do it. His argument is it's *difficult* and therefore blizzard would never do it "for just one addon."
---
It's not impossible. It just requires deep tuning of the API. His argument is wrong that it's impossible. It's just difficult, and his argument is that blizz won't do it "for just one addon". That's a bullshit assumption.
---
Because this is a private server anymore where every server is run by a different group of people. The capability to have server continuity is huge. And leveling from 1 each expansion is just not how it worked, blizz is giving us game play as is worked then.
---
This....is....classic. It never existed in vanilla, not until multiple expansions it at least.
---
No sympathy for rogues but the add-on is muffed
---
Oof
---
HA! No.
---
Nah just tag the rogue and kill it
---
&gt; save grenade for their sheep interrupt and whale away.
---
And then he just sheeps you again and resets. What world do you play in?
---
&gt; man you are really adamant about removing it
---
Yes, I am adamant about removing wallhacks from World of Warcraft.
---
Yikes
---
Doesn't agi provide crit chance at least?
---
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE! Jesus Christ I hate how everyone says phase 2 is gonna be hard. It won‚Äôt. It‚Äôll be relatively the same
---
your gear is way too defensive.
---
am rogue, doesn't bother me, get good and stay in stealth
---
SPeiest 100% 
---
Your toolkit is nuts, probably the second best base kit of spells next to a mage, and it‚Äôs just ridiculously fun to fear+silence+MC... etc...
---
If he's not a software dev on the team he doesn't know how the API works dude lmfao. He's a script kiddie who wrote out a function in pseudocode and is saying therefore it's *literally impossible* to modify.
---
How the hell are you guys this gullible?
---
people - including me - have been running snipe scans for years on retain and since the release of classic. snipe scanning is not bannable. 
---
macroing the buy function with 3p sw is bannable, and I'm sure that's what your friend was doing if your story is true.
---

IIRC the summoning circle is a [doodad](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Doodad) (not sure if they‚Äôre still called that in WoW) placed in the environment like any other object or item you can interact with, not just a part of the ground design. It‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs a glitch that could cause it to de-spawn or spawn underground or something
---
I feel this about a lot of add-ons, maybe unpopular opinion but I hate AH add-ons. If you want to make the kind of AH money that you do with automated add-ons for it, you should have to spend your time looking at the AH vs. doing other things. Earn it.
---
Good. Fuck that server.
---
&gt; it takes no time as I pull because they are keybound. So as they are targeted they are marked. 
---
How do you do this? Is it just a keybound macro?
---
Rofl...read your post out loud this time next week, see if you share the same sentiment.
---
If they open the dark portal on my classic server i would instantly unsub and go back to private servers. They promised us classic would be like a museum piece
---
I‚Äôve had the same character for 15 years on my retail account. I‚Äôd say I care about it.
---
We had not one, but two (!) hunters drive right by us on epic mounts while doing the feralas chicken escort. That means my luck has run out forever after
---

---
Even at lowest settings haha. I was fine until ashenvale.
---
I have gather mate but it only shows notes that I've hit personally? Is there a way to turn on the database to see all spawns? Low pop server means not a bunch of people out farming those areas so all nodes will probably be open for me
---
This is honestly the answer I'm looking for just want to know why thank you
---
Well...to be fair, that was nerfed.  As were many others that automated gameplay/made things too easy.
---
Wouldnt this be a similar situation?
---
Beating the most gimped PvP class in the game as the most broken one. Real good job, top plays! Not saying the guy can't play mage, he obviously knows his stuff but still
---
&gt; He also explained that if Blizzard did what they needed to do to prevent this addon from working, it would effectively kill all addons which rely on the combat logs, like damage meters, DBM (and similar mods) and countless others.
---
Based on...
---
...wait for it...
---
...his ass.
---
You're taking his word for that. He has no fucking clue how the backend of the API works. He has never seen it in his life. He is pulling this entirely from his ass on how he *thinks* it works. I would be genuinely shocked if any of you saying this is impossible have any experience with professional software development. Modifying API data parsing to handle exploits like this, where some data is okay in some situations but exploited in others, is literally run of the fucking mill software development. It would be a tedious change on the backend but it's wholly possible.
---
I am only going from memory but in BC you definitely had to relearn all ranks of a "forgotten" ability. I don't think Vanilla had it nice then they made it harder in BC so I guess relearning it is.
---
Rookie mistake, you kick just before killing the mob.
---
If the problem is PVP and people want to use DBM for PVE just disable player combat information being presented to the other team.
---
All that changed is no auto invite. 
---
Why are you pretending to understand shit you clearly don't?
---
They didn't lie. The core functionality is the same, minor features were removed. That's it. Same LFG Tool. 
---
You kids slay me.
---
Other guy is confusing retail this guys right
---
The point was complexity, not nerfing.
---
Yes, it was nerfed. This addon cannot be nerfed without breaking anything else that reads chat parses.
---
Well I think EU‚Äôs a totally different thing since you‚Äôre probably not going to nerf your latency just to play on faerlina, although I think Guzu did for the dueling tournament
---
That's my thought too. I use it to stay alive while questing in contested zones. I'd say my mortality rate has improved (or decreased, however you articulate it) by double digit percentages. It's never occurred to me to use this to hunt other players.
---
&gt; Assuming classic+ will ever be a thing is a huge stretch
---
Agreed.
---
Not to mention that TBC is a guaranteed success and huge $$ gain. They also said that theyve done most work for TBC when they did classic because they went "backwards" from BFA to classic so its a WAY cheaper process than literally developing a new alternative WoW lore &amp; Universe that directly contradicts and undermines BFA timeline.
---
It makes 0 sense to expect Classic+ as of now.
---
I've been stuck in an hotel room in the middle of nowhere without internet access for two weeks. Two weeks! Hotel rooms are made for pleasuring yourself. It was hell.
---
So my advice to everyone: curate some of your favorite scenes and have backups on your harddrives. You never know when you might need them.
---
&gt; wanding
---
&gt; All that changed is no auto invite. 
---
...Which is watering it down.
---
This guy is wrong. You don‚Äôt have to re train. I switch specs on my lock twice a week and never have to re learn shadowburn.
---
I imagine this actually sucks for rogues.
---
When I know one of you is nearby and hostile, I pop Perception and keep click spamming the Spy nameplate until you're targetable to try to get the first move.
---
How is TSM even remotely similar to botting?
---
The only knowledge I need is knowing that your friend says he was banned for using TSM. Araxom has already confirmed several times that TSM will not get you banned. Nothing it does is bannable. What will get you banned is using AHK to use TSM. Your friend was botting or did something else like buy gold and is lying to you.
---
In all fairness, a museum piece could mean WoW gets to evolve as it did the first time. They showed every expansion in the Chromie trailer as it reversed.
---
Vanilla had the same add-on built to read the combat log and tell you when someone stealthed nearby. It displayed it and basically gave you everything to prepare for the tank. 
---
You can't see through stealth with this add-on. It's not a magic win all wpvp addin. Numbers are going to matter more than any add-on you download.
---
I mean, I agree with the other dude. I‚Äôve met some nice mages but the only ninja looting, complete dickheads I‚Äôve met have all been mages.
---
Never late man. Trying to get people leveled and going for our (and my) first raid. Right now, by the looks of it, we aren't raiding for the next month as a guild. A small group of ~7 of my guildies could certainly start pugging right now, but hosting? Nah, we all need to work of getting our Aqual Quintessences , getting other guildies pre-BiS, recruiting enough people to fill a roster, and just getting everyone to 60.
---
The beauty of Classic includes a timetable that doesn't force you to push content immediately. If we end up raiding before P3, we'll be just as caught up as everyone else in terms of content cleared. I love it.
---
When i was a alchemist I posted a 5g charge, someone whispered me and asked me to bump it up to 7-10g to keep the market high, its a 4day xmute on something worth 70g when we get basically nothing. I relisted my charge to 10g and had a buyer in a second. Spoke to them about pricing and they said they would have absolutely bought it at 15g. You have a demand and alch's can do it once every 48 hours. at 5g a xmute I'd rather buy the mats myself and xmute, I generated more profit doing this, Selling them for 10g gave me around the same amount. So I kept 5g for guildies and 10g for non. I charged guildies because there were so many who need them, it was first come first serve.
---
I bought this recently, you can already get it for 450, placed a store pickup order. Very good deal.
---
You're an idiot then. I play late at night and during the day. You act as though the game is completely dead at non-peak hours. I also get two days off. Can I raid? No because most raids are on weekends or when I'm working. Try again.
---
I cant speak for scrubs.
---
Easiest way to test is to spec what you have unlearned again. 
---
The look at your spell book to see what ranks you have.
---
My head canon is that you have to get perfect masks, and sometimes they get ruined during the fight.
---
Another thing I started thinking about after this is if the same mechanic can be used to gain honor in fights you aren't a participant of. I'm going to test that this week with the release of phase 2. If it works the same as in the dungeon, I might be able to gain honor from fights happening all the way across the zone.
---
Yeah, noticed that too. Skull is enough, no need to mark more.. If tank is not doing it, even after notifying, I do it myself as dps and it usually works. Even if tank ignores it completely and 3 dps focus it, it can be zerged without being dangerous. In party, luckily anyone can put markers. (Not in raid though)     
---
On the other hand I have had runs where no marking was neeeded and it went smooooth. People knew what is the dangerous mob in the pack and focusing it correctly. But thats really rare if it's a pug :D
---
My understanding from the situation is that he did not do this. However, the problem is that Blizz doesn't want to discuss this stuff. They just send him an email. Where they said he's been banned for 183 days for Auction house sniping. And they close the email with saying you can't appeal to this decision. 
---
I know that he wrote to the creators of TSM. Who told him, they think he could get the decision overturned. As he's not the only one to have been hit by this ban. The TSM addon has since been updated as well. 
---
Anyway this happened a few weeks ago and up until this point Blizz hasn't responded as far as I know. And the ban is still active.
---
I just got recepie and all the mats from ah, did tailoring and robe in one day, then dropped tailoring for herbalism to farm the way I like it. I don't think it was a great investment but I didn't want to be cheap mage.
---
It's a system that has always worked in WoW. Classic, Retail, or otherwise.
---
It existed in Vanilla too as the add-on "Paranoia".
---
Is it gamebreaking? Sure; but no more broken than Protection Paladins being non-viable in raids; and no more broken than AoE farm groups that generate copious amounts of gold and XP.
---
It's either #nochanges or #allthechanges. You can't pick and choose which broken features you want and which you don't.
---
so?
---
Yes, you have to re-purchase all the ranks for mind flay (for example). This is why the cost to train ranks of talented-abilities are much cheaper than the rest of your abilities.
---
The thing is, addons and macros, scripts are not approved by blizzard like in console versions of skyrim.. They simply either work because they are using commands they are allowed to use or they dont run.
---
If they "ban" an addon you can simply rewrite it as a separate addon.
---
Thats why they dont ban addons, they cant ban them at all., they block or limit commands and break them that way.
---
You are allowed to do everything you can with the addons.
---
As a warrior who is underestimated by every class, bring it on! :D Did some great PVP recently and honor isnt even out yet.
---
okay thank you.
---
What would be better to equipe: Second wind or the dire maul priest trinket from the quest. I don't remember the name... the one with fire resistance.
---
64% of people *on Reddit.**  Reddit does not accurately represent in-game demographics.
---
Agreed they might not know that healing aggro exist, I've never played retail but I heard it's not hard to hold aggro so maybe they just do not know better
---
Why are you like this?
---
Gz :)
---
&gt; Any person who isn't an idiot wouldn't risk their account to use an addon that Blizzard says can get them banned.
---
Someone would just make a new addon called "NotTheSpyAddonThatWasBanned", which would do the exact same thing as the banned addon and use that instead.
---
But how do you kill that which has no life?
---
&gt;What would be better to equipe: Second wind or the dire maul priest trinket from the quest. I don't remember the name... the one with fire resistance.
---
Vanilla had a similar add-on anyway
---
The difference between pretty watered down and just watered down is immense. I'm responding to the first because that's what you said.
---
ClassicLFG kept its core functionality and ditched two minor features. Nothing significant was lost.
---
I tried finding a source but seems like there is literally nothing out there.
---
One thing I am 99% sure you can do is cast Beast Lore on Magmadar to find out what his resistances are. But nobody seems to have logged this information anywhere, at least not that I can find.
---
From my experience, playing a frost mage in private servers, pretty much all mobs in MC were either immune or highly resistant to fire. Making fireball totally unviable even on mobs that are not immune.
---
+1, fuck people downvoting, this addon is cancer for mass WPVP
---
Man a friend gave me evocators blade as collateral for 20g that he owed me right before he quit the game. I've been trying to sell this for like 4 weeks now and it expires on AH every time.
---
You're a pussy bro, shouldnt be caring so much about your virtual characters.
---
A lot of people don't run dungeons while leveling.  I don't.
---
Could he just not have rolled, until you were removed from the instance? How long is the roll timer vs instance kick?
---
I've played it for weeks. It absolutely works 100% of the time for me
---
Incorrect, I literally just did this yesterday, as soon as I clicked "Aimed Shot" in my talents it immediately gave me all 6 ranks of it.
---
Over time the queues for Faerlina got pretty reasonable because of the player drop off, now that the queues might be back there will probably be more leaving because they might not want to deal with another round of queues, we shall wait and see!
---
Good luck getting into the entrance, hell even running out to reset is dangerous
---
Not nerfed, fixed. It was never intended to be Vanish.
---
wl is godkingchampion of pvp. u fuck all and everything even when you just dot it. so u be fine
---
Yes, but the person above was talk about sinister strikes and that they didn‚Äôt believe 6% was max for that.
---
This is what I needed. Thanks!
---
guess that's why they're cheap them.
---
Why are people such pieces of shit sometimes?
---
Faerlina easily best in us. All other large servers have manor faction imbalanca.
---
Maybe you just suck
---
They wont go up, it a stack of black lotus is 40g the setver is well on its way to die out, aq isnt suddenly going to revive it.
---
But you are doing exactly what I was talking about; talking pure group optimisation, which was never the conversation to begin with.
---
Also even your point is questionable, for the mitigation that shadow form brings is insane.
---
&gt;and sit on them.
---
Won't that crush the flower?
---
60's are easy to spot by their gear
---
Is there specific specs for BGs or can I just run SL
---
Yes look up gathermate2 data. There's a link on the curseforge page for gathermate2
---
Hell yeah I am ready, 50 faps ready for pvp ownage!
---
Yes. You have to have the eye equipped.
---
what
---
well if you respec often it adds up to a lot over time
---
Wonder if it would be possible to just get rid of a ton of the useless fluff in the combat log to reduce the calls that the addon could use.
---
Warriors, for example, appear in the log whenever they become close enough to render by "gaining X stance". Why exactly does the log need to show that to other players? I understand why it may be useful information, but at the same time, if it was to break addons such as this, I could get on board with doing without stuff like that. At least get rid of as much as possible to nerf the addon a TON.
---
It would be no different than my guitars being destroyed in a fire, so no I still disagree with you and I think the majority of people would.
---
Hey, nothing wrong with warrior PvP, except when fighting frost mages.  They are your nemesis without blowing consumes.
---
I also respec a few times a week on my priest and always have to relearn mind flay and divine spirit every time.
---
Sounds like you sucking, not a broken addon.
---
Because shadowburn costs a soul shard and not mana. Probably. I actually play a druid but I do have to relearn faerie fire and insect swarm.
---
Goran is that you??
---
*Laughing in PvE server
---
You don't decide the spirit of the game for everyone else so how about no.
---
You can't see stealth, I don't know where that misconception popped up. All it does is say "someone stealthed hear you" not even "this rogue stealth 35 feet behind you"; all you get is a notification that someone stealthed. That existed in vanilla, too, so idk why it's such a big deal now
---
3 hours per day * 77 days since release = 231 hours (9 days, 15 hours).  It's a slower pace, but that's still well within the normal window to hit 60.  If you let yourself get sidetracked with chasing down some specific item in a dungeon, or leveling Fishing, or just spent a lot of time shooting the shit or leveling up some crafting profession, it'd be very easy to eclipse a 10 days /played pace to 60.
---
**Botting**
---
n. a device or piece of software that can execute commands or perform routine tasks, as electronic searches, usually without user intervention
---
From the TSM features page:
---
&gt; TSM's Crafting window allows you analyze what crafts will sell profitably and **allows you to build a queue, speeding up the crafting process dramatically**. It also includes the powerful Gathering **function that will help guide you toward easily acquiring any needed materials.**
---
--
---
&gt; The Destroying window helps efficiently mill, prospect, and disenchants items at super speed!
---
&gt; TSM's Mailing window allows you to quickly and easily empty your mailbox as well as automatically send items to other characters with the single click of a button.
---
&gt; The BankUI helps manage your inventory by allowing you to easily move predefined groups of items between your bags, bank, and guild bank.
---
Automating tasks into a single button press, automatically scanning the markets and surrounding area to tell you the most efficient paths for profit and automatically doing calculations for the most optimal way to craft and the pricing to sell things is quite literally bot-functionality. It's not outright botting, obviously, but it goes against the spirit of an RPG and Classic in my opinion and is quite borderline.
---
You can only gain honor when you are in a group that is fighting right? In that case you might as well be in the battle to help out instead of just staying far away imo
---
Not your fault.  Tanking those 4-5 group pulls is tough, you need CC from some class, hunter trap, mage polymorph, rouge sap etc.  When I tank, if DPS pulls aggro, I don't usually change up my system of tab target sunders/revenge, pop demo shout and battle shout, they are good aoe threat.  I warstomp as tauren, which is nice to keep mobs that decide to start running off stationary for the taunt.  But, the only one I care about pulling aggro is the healer.  Save challenging shout for the oh shit moments.  But it sounds like you are basically doing the right thing, tanking is hard in vanilla, and I don't think people realize that doing 5 mans means you don't have to go pedal to the metal dps the entire time, you don't have to go full pro gamer mode to take down those level 58 elites.  
---
Additionally, if you are a mage, I love your dps, but you know you can sheep and do single target damage.  some pulls work better without blizzard or cone of cold.  Sometimes they are useful for non elites, or when targets are getting to low hp, but usually you just end up pulling something away from the tank, and then when you get healed, the healer gets aggro.
---
And for the LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, if you pull aggro don't lose your shit and jump around and run off, taunt does not have unlimited range, run the mob back to the tank, and he will snag it.  This is my biggest pet peeve.  If you pull aggro, CC that shit yourself or run it back to the tank.  You should never pull aggro doing single target dps on the skull guy.  As we mentioned aoe threat gen in classic is very weak, and every run isn't a spellcleave aoe farm.
---
It‚Äôs called details, but only works if both players are using it! :)
---
Go Dwarf and don't look back. Currently playing a Forsaken mage and miss playing my Dwarf.
---
But given how much easier it was to make gold in TBC, there's no point hoarding it during classic
---
What do you mean, reappearing at the trainer? If it shows up as unavailable, then that's because you don't currently know them. As soon as you took the talent, you'll immediately re-learn the higher ranks and they won't be available from the trainer.
---
Just happened to be looking through the best buy black Friday ad. I was like whoa a dedicated GPU with a not complete potato cpu and ssd! 450$??? Seemed like a home run to me lol
---
"Race to World First".
---
I rest my case.
---
We‚Äôre friends now...
---
And if they look like a hobo, they're in their 50s.
---
&gt; That mustard felt good.
---
So this is why no one wants to do stealth raids on major cities anymore...
---
This also explains how they were able to find us so easily when I finally managed to get a group of rogues together to do this.
---
I like the add-on because if it detects stealth I can rank 1 consecration and spam repentence. Makes a 50/50 really one sided.
---
&gt; More than 30% downvoted lol. So much for people caring about muh classic game integrity. 
---
Classic PvP was always rubbish anyway, mostly about being ganked while perma-stunfucked. 
---
And the experience now isn't much like classic, as all the griefers have rolled the optimial griefing classes on horde side from the start...
---
I do, it drives me nuts. sometimes I can click on items and people, sometimes I cant. I have my ipad up and have to google items now
---
Even if you played 2 hours every night since release devoted completely to one character that would still be 1-60 in 6.4 days played. Most people will probably ding 60 in the 9-10 days played range. 
---
If you play 3 hours every night since release then you'd probably be 60 by now, but that level of play is far from casual, or even a bit more hardcore than the *average* player imo.
---
People probably won't be spawn camping the BRD portal.  It doesn't pay out well.  It's too far away from everything and makes little sense.  Camping BRS and MC is much easier and links together nicely.
---
it happens for both sides. With that being said, the horde is better at pvp with numbers advantage or not. Facts
---
Hemorrhage = raw atp

Backstab/daggers = agility aka crit

Any item you can click on the different patch versions on the right to see how it changed

The mirror match is all about who goes OOM. If played perfectly, neither Druid will ever lose. Your game plan should be:
---
1) If he goes animal form, you hibernate. He either shifts out wasting mana (AKA you closer to winning), or you sleep him and can reset the fight by drinking (AKA you less close to losing)
---
2) If he uses DoTs on you, you can go cat form to pressure him, since DOTS on you prevent him from sleeping you. Remember to fall back to 1) if he tries to do the same, since you explicitly WON'T DOT him.
---
If played perfectly, neither druid will use DOTS, and neither druid will use animal forms. That means you both are literally in caster form auto attacking. Using direct damage spells is a bad idea, since the mana you will spend to do damage will be more than mana he has to spent to heal back up, so that's also no an option. Since you won't be able to kill a druid in caster form by auto attacking, basically neither will ever lose with perfect play.
---
However, not many druids play optimally, so use 1) or 2) and exploit his mistakes :)
---
Nope, only when you change stance.
---
Most people react to players, they do something to prepare for combat. They activate their rage skill, cast a shield, go into stealth.
---
The addon only notifies you that someone did something, it cant tell you where, it cant even tell you if you are the target in many cases, its simply a good alarm.
---
No, there was no addon like Spy used en masse for most of Vanilla. Maybe they became popular towards the end after I had quit, but certainly not early on.
---
Rule nr 3 of this subreddit does not allow this.
---
I was lucky enough the item dropped at one of the Satyrs just before the entrance to BFD, so I wasn't instanced :D

Generally you have to retrain them, but talent-related skills are generally 80-90% cheaper than normal skills.
---
So max rank ice barrier is costs 20 silver compared to the ~3gold for similar level 56-60 spells.
---
Why don't you show evidence that he's wrong rather than going on a rage and calling people script kiddie
---
Boy this guy thinks 1-2 hours every day is a reasonable expectation haha
---
Take your time leveling and explore.  If you want some guidance then look up zones by level charts.  I recommend avoiding any leveling guides that specifically pick routes for you as they will turn leveling into a grind instead of an adventure.
---
Questie will expedite locating objectives without directing you to skip/do/grind etc.  It detracts a little but not as bad as something that's more in depth.  Mainly it will show you where quests are on the map.  I believe you can set it up to display only where the quest starts instead of objectives if you really want to limit how much help you get.
---
You will burn out on end game quick if you grind straight through to prebis and raids.  Many of the people who have done this are burning out already, some quit, or others are just nolifing it with nothing better to do in their life so they are here.
---
Be lost, make it an adventure, not a highway.
---
Ah yes the ‚Äúevery server but the pre-launch servers are dead‚Äù garbage
---
So, just stay under 48 and you're OK? Strange... but ok. Why should I care...
---
Its the opposite for me, it helps me find people to gank and they usually waste spells/mana trying to find me, i still get the opener 100% of the time.
---
&gt;You must be a miserable person to be around if you're this indignant
---
I mean to harp this hard on something when you've been proven wrong on is hilarious. Are you at all self aware or do you only project your butthurt and insecurities onto strangers?
---
That resentment line is so telling. Tell me, do you have any irl friends?
---
I don't really care, just twisting the knife :D
---
Yeah that's how it been working for me. I swear I remembered in vanilla having to rebuy the new ranks when respeccing, but could be misremembering
---
That‚Äôs because they were real, good, blizzard servers and not this cloud garbage we have these days.
---
perhaps we shouldn't care about people who arent involved in the game?
---
I‚Äôm level 40 and just got to Badlands. Every mob seems to be a quest, simmering to Shimmering Flats in 1k Needles. I can‚Äôt wait! Not arsed when I get 60, just loving the walk down memory lane. Even if I do get tempted almost daily to play an alt!
---
The phrase quit while you're still ahead comes to mind, but you're already past that point so just stop before you make an even bigger fool of yourself.
---
You heard it on reddit first folks, pressing a button to send mail is botting.
---
wait there's people like this? you vendor stuff and try to contact gms to get it back?  I'm so lost. how do you function
---
totally
---
Most of the good grinding spots are highly contested, which makes it kinda inefficient. Unless you play at the middle of the night.
---
Dunno about private servers, they do have a lot of stuff differently. But if you look at DPS chart logs for mages in MC, fire wins every time apart from the two fire immune bosses.
---
I respect fairly often on my warlock. I haven't done too much testing, but I suspect either you do not have to train if you immediately talent back into the skill, or there is a certain amount of time where you can relearn it. Similar to you, if I am sm/ruin and go sm/ds, I do not need to retrain siphon life. But if I am ds/ruin and go sm/ds I do need to respec siphon life. Similar with shadowburn between the specs.
---
instance kick is ~ 1 minute. Not sure about roll timer
---
&gt; You can read the combat logs yourself and find every single information by hand. The addon simply reads this information and warns you of stuff happening around you.
---
And botting is simply doing the exact same actions automatically that a player does. The exact same behavior, just automated. Mysteriously, botters still get banned and blizz still finds ways to limit it!
---
&gt; Because its so simple and dozens of addons do it for different purposes they cant change it without breaking every single statistic and combat addon
---
Based on...your ass.
---
A bunch of script kids who edit .config or .txt files with &lt;100 lines in any language adamantly insisting they know the intricate backend workings of blizzard data parser API's is a real hilarious bit.
---
&gt;Fearmongering absolutely works even if the ban rate is low because people aren't gonna risk 1000s of hours for some addon.
---
Are you dyslexic?
---
You wanna help provide some 'knowledge' along with your assertion in the form of some sort of proof people have been banned for regular use of TSM?
---
What are the "real" level ranges for blackrock mountain instances as a mage? I've been told that I can go to BRD as soon as level 52 or 53, but I'm doubtful. My only experiences with those instances are in retail where you can do it at 50 safely.
---
I'm pretty sure Reddit has a max of 2 stickied threads unfortunately.
---
Is that going to be good honor though? Wouldn't participating in world raids be better for actually Farmers? The corpae camping people are already doing it just to troll.
---
Unfortunately you cannot get it back if it's been too long. I did the same thing with an item I wanted to get back, after changing specs.
---
Second wind
---
Just speaking the truth :)
---
That's not what Spy does. Spy doesn't auto-find stealthed players. If it did, that would be broken. You literally get a notification that someone stealthed near you. That's it. you can't click their name because if you cannot find them, you cannot target them. The add-on doesn't do it for you, it just gives information based on your combat log. If this story is true, they were using something else to find you. That, or we are missing the whole truth.
---
It's certainly good for your guild's reputation.
---
So if you want to "repay" them, just hang out in Ironforge with the weapon equipped.
---
thank you!
---
*must‚Äôve
---
As in ‚Äúmust have‚Äù &lt;3
---
nothing wrong with that. If you are on a pvp server, it's going to be rough for a few weeks most likely. No rush to the end game anyhow.  You can catch up quick if you plan on doing the raids or pvp.
---
Wallhacks... is this an FPS now?
---
Wow, you take angry to a whole new level :)
---
The hypocrisy of saying I have a "limited" perspective is hysterical. I have no problem with you not allowing Boomkins in your "progressive" (which still needs consumables for MC LOL ), but I also can understand more fun casual guilds might not be so "min/max" and just enjoy the game while they clear MC...
---
I'll be blocking you now, enjoy your heart attack by 40.
---
So the solution to the problem is not blizzard fixing it, but we have to remove a game feature
---
Don't have the time to help theorycraft on your items, sorry , but maybe this helps: at 305 weapon skill (just like at your 313) your effective hit cap is 6%, at 315 it's 5%.
---
Is corpse camping going to be better than just being in a raid v raid fight? Does dying hurt your honor?
---
Imagine comparing looking at combat logs (something 99% won't do) to an easy addon like Spy. 
---
Big brain.
---
&gt; Why don't you show evidence that he's wrong rather than going on a rage and calling people script kiddie
---
Because I'm not so arrogant to presume I understand the backend, hidden data parsing code from the WoW team? And I don't like talking out of my ass about things I don't know info on? No info better than pulled out of your ass info. Saying "it's impossible" when you have no idea how the code works is just ridiculous.
---
Scroll your camera away, there, now you see peoples nameplates behind you.
---
Just because you dont do X its not illegal to everyone else.
---
im using hallowends candy to get the 30 minute levitation spell, thinking there was something to see walking along here. nope, nothing.
---
They would have to prevent abuse of the character copy - anyone caught mailing all their gold around to different characters prior to each character transfer would probably be banned for exploiting though.
---
The WoW API is literally available and open to see every command and how it functions, dude.

You couldn't write addons without it.

I don't use it nefariously, but it is very nice to have since it warns when an enemy in range stealths up. That doesn't give you an advantage other than knowing that some dick is about to try and gank you. Honestly, keep it. it evens the playing field against stealthed assholes
---
&gt; Yea exactly the addons weren't as powerful back then
---
You totally understood their point.  It's not that addons weren't as powerful, it's that the developers weren't as good at implementing features.  This could have been accomplished in Vanilla and WOULD HAVE if the game had lasted long enough for these developers to learn how.
---
&gt; the horde is better at pvp with numbers advantage or not. Facts
---
I will never understand this level of delusion in people who rep their side so hard. Feels like most horde pvp players secretly want an RPPVP server because my god you can't stop sucking your own dicks.
---
Thats just for 1 night
---
Even Everest has guidelines and requirements to mitigate the dangers.
---
You can invite a friend or even your alt, log out all dungeon runners, reset once they are all offline and they sit at the dungeon entrance within the dungeon ready to go. 
---
No need to step outside.
---
In his defence you did call it a quest item and not a quest reward so he was probably not familiar with the item or something and actually thought you did mean a quest item and not a reward which he would of been correct in saying to require the quest
---
I don't think the skeletons are the problem in this situation. I have plenty of holy water and the flamming oil sutff so it shouldn't be an issue. It's more mana consumption that I'm scared of.
---
Nah, blessing of sanctuary is where its at. Holy damage when blocking? Yes please.
---
Dungeon tanking is very easy as you get higher level. It takes a bit more cordnation from your group at lower levels. (Like 20-30). They will need to pay attention and focus the kill order instead of mindlessly killing whatever. Consecration takes time to build up threat and sadly doesn't do instant threat like on private servers.   
---
But dungeon tanking is the usual 11/31/9 build with points in Imp Strength, Imp SoR and Consecration. Consecration is your bread and butter in dungeons.   
---
For the prot tree put points into redoubt and reckoning (This is great in dungeons since you can force procs when having multible mobs on you with a sit macro)

---
It's more a matter of practicality.  If I'm honor grinding and killing lowbies, I might just kill the 48 grouped with a 47 and walk away.  People are going to be going nuts for honor in the first few weeks.  Anything with a green level will be a prized target and anything grey a resounding 'meh'.  Sure some people will gank anything.  But the majority of players ignore the other faction on PvP servers.  Once honor changes, a green level is a tempting free kill.  That is what they are referring to.
---
Classic
---
I mean that‚Äôs a nice blade and all, but that [Cedar Walking Stick]...
---
That is the point, 20g is not a great deal for someone as it's only good for them leveling maybe 5 to 10 levels. 20G is a waste to them. They got mounts to save for. No one is twinking or buying blues for leveling man
---
Ah that's fuckin lame dude
---
Yeah all the trolls are already out corpse camping. Legitimate PvP Farmers are going to be in large groups hunting for big numbers. Not getting one honorable kill every 10 minutes on your corpse.
---
Nice playtime for 60 ding, did you follow any guide? I had like 8d 20h with my warlock (no spellcleaves, no guide, did professions).
---
Just didn't like it. It's way less organic than world pvp or even battlegrounds.
---
r/boneappletea
---
he clearly made them as jokes, but i find what he says quite honest
---
That's Gandalf's line though. Should have gone with "Let them come! There's one dwarf yet in Ironforge that still draws breath!"
---
I do not but I would like to know as well. My priest friend has been hunting this.
---
Or, hear me out, we just disable spy. Seems way easier than completely changing the data flow.
---
Joking aside, I'm really sick of the "Don't be in a rush to do content you enjoy! I'm 25 days /played so far, lvl 26, and slowly leveling my herbalism!"
---
If you want to take the game slow, that's your business. But if people want to take the game fast, that is their business. I love leveling, but many people prefer end game dungeons. I'm not sure why it seems like the "take it slow" people are so much louder - I've never seen anyone advocate for rushing to 60...
---
Playing alts, changing servers, real life. There are a lot of reasons someone is not 60 yet.
---
Cool I‚Äôll check it out
---
No, you just continue as normal. You'll still get killed by players sub 48.
---
Correct, but dungeon threat is just fine and ive had no issues tanking clean runs in all 5 mans and even solo tanking UBRS.
---
Bloodsail?
---
I dont know why youre being downvoted. 
---
&gt;Just knowing a rogue is there doesn't help a ton.
---
It helps zero, the point of stealth is using openers while stealth, which spy doesnt negates.
---
&gt; targeting me through my stealth unless they were human.
---
They cant, thats why it mostly helps rogues to find gank targets and make enemies waste their mana looking for rogues.
---
Im loving the people defending it because they think its bad for rogues tho lol.
---
What rotations?  Most people press like 1 button for the entire encounter.
---
There would likely be a specific system created and put in place for this specific scenario that handles such things yea.
---
It's not that those under 48 won't get killed, but those 48 and up will be farmed
---
Not sure how it was for other regions, but every server was Full until the 3rd bout of new servers added to the list in EU.
---
By this point, a lot of guilds were ingrained.
---
I'm about to be level 42 and by the gods am I glad I'm on a PvE server lmao
---
the transfer server for my server is dead as fuck. im sure everyone has their own definition of a dead server.
---
during the last week that the census addon worked, there were more 60s online my server than there were people in total on the transfer server. 
---
before the first round of transfer ended there were 20 60s online at 10 pm on a saturday. it was weeks before they were able to get a *single* group together for mc, and that was a guild run -- in comparison to day 1 servers, which were doing full clear MC pugs weeks before them.
---
at the time of this post there are 72 60s online the transfer server, and 253 on my server... which has more 60 mages online than there are 60s online in total on the transfer server.
---
i don't know what your classification of dead is, but if you can't pug MC or ony more than one night a week, or at all, then it is a dead server. it won't get any better for bwl and beyond.
---
Well technically it wasn't a loot issue, it was an item that was on a mob that belonged to you that got deleted before you noticed. Have you tried the item restoration page?
---
Yes. That is some shady shit by him though.
---
Why should he accept "critisism" if it isnt useful? This isnt even critisism, just shittalk.
---
3 of our priests got it, 1 struggled (he was the first) 2nd priest said it was easy as pie, 3rd got it yesterday not had a chance to speak to him about it
---
Shaman my dude
---
Sorry like I said if the tanks focusing one and we all burst the other that is still split DPS
---
The combat log worked this way in vanilla, it isn't changing because of butthurt rogues.
---
Do you not see the irony in telling me to go back to retail because you want to change Classic from how it exists?
---
Your post is peak stupidity.
---
I just want a keyring!!
---
The point here is this GM is completely and totally unknowledgable, he told me to abandon the quest to get back the quest reward.
---
Well, yeah, they shouldn't get in trouble for being jerks, but you should be able to get the item you won if you complain to blizz... that's BS
---
They cast Track Humanoids. Only an issue if you have any sort of other Tracking abilities like Herbalism, Mining, Treasure, etc.  
---
I always thought it wasn't a spell that showed up on the combat log since casting any Hunter Tracking doesn't do anything to knock you out of anything. Like you can cast Track Humanoids while Shadowmelded, eating/drinking and it doesn't unstealth or stop you from eating/drinking. Good to know.
---
at 40 you'll still be grey to level 60's so they have no reason to kill you (other than for fun) 48-59 is the danger zone
---
Telling people they have to scrap their characters they did huge grinds on like winterspring frostsaber, legendary items, etc is more than just a small change. That completely removes incentive to raid on classic if they ever announced bc in that fashion.
---
Why put in effort to farm gold and get the best gear possible if I'm going to be put on the same starter level 1s as someone who didnt play a day of classic.
---
Wow is a carrot on a stick, you need to give people a reason to want to progress forward.
---
You left his name unblocked so why block it with green later?
---
Damn boi u fast.
---
Not any easier to find 4 aoe then it is to find a tank.
---
Those spiders in Western Plaguelands ARE THE WORST!  They share the same spawn spots.  Took me a while to figure that out hahahahahaha
---
Prob like 6-8 on mine. But that's why I stopped playing classic
---
/cast Curse of Agony
---
/petattack
---
Sorry I should be more specific, I plan on rolling horde and am curious peoples experience with realm pop, world pvp, RPing, etc.
---
GM's Back in the classic days used to be really cool and badass, they'd go out of their way, even for some dumb shit, and this was the first ticket I made in classic. I figured I'd try my hand.
---
oh yeh? so it should deadly boss mod. It's literally cheating.    
---
If you had modded another other game like  like deadly boss does you would be banned.
---
The only part I want saved from it is the kill-on-sight list. I don't need combat log parsing to alert me to KoS people nearby, just put an icon next to their name and play a sound if I mouse over or target a KoS player.
---
They can't kill this addon without deleting the combat log which will never happen
---
It gets close to unplayable on my server with as little as 40v40. That's the real issue with all of this. I would expect to always lag and not be upset about it during those huge Stormwind raids or when multiple guilds on each faction show up somewhere, but it truly doesn't take very large crowds to get really bad lag right now and that is a problem.
---
Just be aware that Druid hots don‚Äôt stack, so if a resto Druid is overwriting rejuv/regrowth on the bear, this may be less effective.
---
&gt; I don't really care, just twisting the knife :D
---
[Whenever you use smileys in an argument.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/096/564/2f7.jpg)
---
Why not just enable it when you are in combat with someone from the opposite faction?  Have it disabled otherwise but turn on once pvp combat is engaged between two players.
---
I didn't say it was impossible I said it was hard. It's a hidden ledge that you wouldn't even know had a platform on top unless you were already riding the mountain edge of the zone.
---
Me too, on alliance side.  Truce until 60 and bg's?
---
For fun seems To be all I get killed for anyway soo I guess im cool with that
---
I played on a PvP servers back in the day, I had enough of that experience lmao. I'm terrible at PvP, and I play on a potato laptop. I'll let everyone else enjoy it lmao
---
Un'goro is fucked, got there last night and was all hype. Ganked by a group of like 3 60s immediately upon walking into the crystal cave at Marsha'ls Refuge, got ganked by three 60s three individual times within the span of 20ish minutes. Idk, only thing I can think of is bored farmers? 
---
I can only imagine what this is gonna be like in a few days when they'll actually be given incentive to kill me. Gonna be screaming in the fetal position like Matt Damon at the end of SPR.
---
Game is not being rushed /sarc
---
Not shadow priest or warlock. I think Druid mage rogue is the answer . Or a good hunter
---
Well I'm a priest, I need my full mana bar to get stam,spirit,armour,shadow prot.
---
I'd like to be able to rez, find somewhere sneaky, and hide while I drink/buff.
---
I'm not talking about just ambushing weaker players or lowbies, I'm just talking about being prepared to fight anybody. Besides that, the whole idea of ambushing people where you have the upper hand is one of the cool things about WORLD pvp instead of instanced fights, any corner could have someone waiting for you, and you can do things to give yourself the advantage too. Having an automatically updating list on the side of your screen of every player in combat log range with sound alerts included when a new one enters or stealths just takes away from that.
---
That's not a "min/max" issue. Your healer has every right to not want to heal when a guild are pulling in a level 56 friend of theirs who should maybe be off finishing their leveling rather than getting pulled through Strat. She's not in your guild, she's not made a commitment to that person like you might have. She might have had some bad experiences.
---
We often run our guildies who are nearly 60 through some dungeon but we know them and trust them not to be idiots. I would never add a random 56 to one of our groups if we were missing a member, we'd just wait.
---
This is using the yeti. Otherwise I here there is some prep needed
---
I refer to them as "The trinket "mark of the chosen" and say I regret vendoring thrash blade since I later learned how good of a mainhand it was.
---
Lol remember in 2005 when you actually had to download porn to watch it.
---
I'm lvl 48 right now and just realized my unfortunate position
---
Well you got your run and orbs and she got her...well something for sure. People try hard too much, you can perfectly do dungeons with a lover lever player, the only indispensable one is tank.
---
A quest item can be regained by restarting the quest not a quest reward. You said quest item not reward and even then still your lack of paying attention either way. No one here feels bad for you because you are clearly a dumbass that feels entitled and doesn't like no for an answer lol. And if you truly understood that he cant help you with everything you wouldn't be on reddit bitching about it like a child.
---
I don't care what they call the servers as long as people that put in effort get to keep that effort moving into whatever comes next.
---
Just gonna completely ignore the first sentence of "I understand anything you can't help me with!" then?
---
Classic wow really doesn't have a lot of hardware requirements. My husband has a 6 year-old MSI laptop that overheats constantly. Still work fine with classic wow.
---
Yea dude, you sure got me!
---
You use WiFi and complain when your lag spikes...?
---
Only show combat logs for characters/NPCs that you or a party member are in active combat with.
---
Wow that was such a hard change.
---
Some moron on westfall is listing ass blades for 4000-6000 gold.  lmao.
---
I wanna say you‚Äôre right but I think vanilla AV is just messing up my memories. Much more likely you‚Äôd have the be in a group, but it‚Äôs not like character models turn grey when you‚Äôd attack. Man I‚Äôm not sure either.
---
why is there a big rush to level before phase 2? im out of the loop.
---
I have Mirah's, this is for OS :P
---
We already saw what happens when we go on the TBC path and no one likes where it ended. If you want that, go play retail.
---
I agree with you fully, but I hope classic will be different.
---
oh yeah? how come I met dozens of alliance that werent registered by Spy until I mouseoverd them? those rogues didnt have their posions up and warriors were somehow without stances and mages had no mage armor or AI? Not buying it...
---
The servers already cannot handle wpvp as it is and you want to make combat logging even more cpu intensive? Nope. Not gonna happen.
---
My current screen is shit so couldn't make out what you typed. Did you make 20g for charging folks?
---
You wanna suggest a rotation then?
---
This is incorrect. That's how it worked in Vanilla, but in Classic you just get all your ranks back instead of wasting the extra ~80-100s.
---
'only' 2h a night is precisely why people aren't 60. 
---
Demanding job, kids, wife, gym, social commitments &amp; getting 8h of sleep a night already stretches my time pretty thin. No fucking way can I spend over 2h playing wow every day.
---
Life comes fast, death cums hard. *Wait, that's illegal*
---
Rofl this happened to me a few weeks ago as well in a Strat group. Fucking idiots
---
So going through your history, I can see that you don‚Äôt seem very nice on Reddit. 
---
I don‚Äôt really care if someone on /r/classicwow thinks I‚Äôm toxic (this is such a toxic sub reddit)
---
But you don‚Äôt know me so go YOU CAN GO TO HECK.
---
if I remember well after a certain amount of kills within a time frame, there is no more HK's from that same target. But It's been 15 years, so might be off.
---
Look, I don't know how the backend code works and all, but I refuse to believe there is not a flag that differentiates player from NPC.
---
Why? What do i need? this is why i am here asking.
---
SL(either with NF or Shadowburn) for beefy tanky style, Conflag/NF for bursty "erasing" spec or SM/ruin as a middle of the road between PVP and PVE.     
---
For serious premades (when BG's are up) you will be most likely required to be SL or Conflag spec. Conflag is a bit more demanding in terms of gear though, not the best "starter" build without crit gear.
---
described me tanking perfectly

Tbh, it‚Äôs all in the shoulders. Keep fighting bro
---
Anybody worry about their server feeling dead? I got to 60 a little bit ago and started leveling an alt, still a good amount of people around but I‚Äôve been hearing grumblings about our server being pretty much dead (ashkandi).
---
Like others have said, some slight over editing at the beginning but overall great video and editing. Best pvp video I've seen hands down. Not just a 1 shot compilation but insane 2v1/3v1 plays. 
---
Damn good work, inspiring as a fellow ele player. Shit, makes me think I need to go engineering.
---
uhh, how do you even decide if someone has Spy or not? " I opened on him but I lost, QQ, he was obviously a cheater with Spy" ??
---
I agree, however I was already submitting a ticket, and if you read my ticket, I listed the things I could use in order of how likely I thought it was I was going to get them fixed. I threw the nose ring in as a bonus.   
---
Additionally I guess I should add a red circle since noone seems to be able to read the whole thing to see where he told me to abandon a quest to receive the rewards again.
---
I don't get these comments along the lines of just 2h queue. 2h on an evening is all most working people have. It's either transfer or not play at all for the foreseeable future.
---
That's just another form of nostalgia though. 
---
Most people don't care either way if in those 5 years they wont ever be logging on the character again. Some people are already content drained.
---
Yup.  Wishing I had too until 60, but there aren't paid transfers yet, don't wanna get stuck on a pve though..
---
re is this GM is completely and totally unknowledgable, he told me to abandon the quest to get back the quest reward.
---
... good feedback brah /s
---
Well, there's so many things to do at 60, too :) Yes, I've seen the post of a guy who took 18 days /played to get to 43 or something like that. I'm 17 days /played, and while I'm level 60 in bis/prebis with a galore of pvp items and a few thousand golds to spare, there are still so many goals, that it seems like they'll never end.
---
Yeah, ambushing players who aren't ready is okay because I did something to earn that advantage. 
---
Being ambushed because an addon said "PLAYER NEARBY AT X COORDINATES" while I'm drinking and rebuffing feels pretty cheap.
---
Not the point.
---
Hnnng I wish that dress wasn‚Äôt sooooo good
---
This is wrong. Agi gives wand crit.
---
I feel that them specifically mentioning a dark sense of humour kinda allows this one. They don't really seem to give a shit like you do.
---
lol, I've spent the majority of my time on my mina so far, as a rogue mind you, letting bygones be bygones and just trying to level. But boy howdy let me tell you after all the ganking at the hands of 60s I've suffered over just the last couple weeks? I'm seriously considering turning and becoming part of the problem. I don't know which of you fuckers are prone to ganking, but I know I'll get a few of you if you all get got.
---
Wow. Haven't heard someone say that since I was a child.
---
It‚Äôs the sauce. Also a cow is there mascot
---
&gt; When BWL releases the difficulty goes way up (from what I've read
---
I'm starting to get really, really skeptical about this.  Either I'm going completely crazy or the raids on Classic are mechanically way, way easier than they were during vanilla.  I legit haven't seen a deep breath in weeks, we clear Onyxia so fast, and back in the day I remember seeing 2-3 every attempt even through BWL era.  Even fights like Rag I don't even see the sons come out anymore.
---
Maybe it's just the accumulated knowledge of 15 years when it comes to everyone minmaxing their class and gear but it sure feels like something's off, and I wonder if that is going to hold true in BWL too.  BWL wasn't even that difficult once you got the fights down until you got to Nef.
---
As long as you're enjoying yourself who cares? \^\_\^ 
---
Friend of mine levelled a rogue to 52, changed his mind, and is now levelling a shaman every night.
---
The point of this post was how unknowledgable the GM was.
---
He‚Äôs kind of right though, under 8 days played means there was a concentrated effort on leveling
---
Yup, counterweights can only be applied to 2h Swords, Maces, Axes, or Polearms
---
Wolfshead/furor/shred is 100% a PvE thing.
---
some guy prepaid for 5 runs which is why you see 15g trade.
---
the price I charge is 3g per person, so I get 12g per run.  Many people jump at that price because many people charge 5g.
---
I just hit 60 with an average playtime of 3 hours a day. It was my first char, but also a mage
---
Alright, i do all of the above already. DPS still pulling
---
what now?
---
I think (someone please confirm) that the honor you give to player X diminishes if you've been killed by player X repeatedly in a given window of time.
---
Yeah, I do realize that and am agreeing with that.
---
I am not a NoChanges person.
---
I would say it‚Äôs as high as 60%. And roughly half of the under60s are in fact the alt of a 60. 
---
1.5 months ago the SM spam was endless, now you barely see it on my server and even BRD is becoming rare.
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs already starting, at least on Bigglesworth. Groups roaming through Burning Steppes and camping bodies.
---
I'm sorry, this happens on servers that aren't full too. Not to the entire server crashing extent, but we had 3 40 mans raid Undercity on Sulfuras and we couldn't move for 10 minutes. Then some of us got ported back to Chillwind Point, others ended up in Southshore.
---
Definitely doesn't seem worth it. Not gonna donate shit or grind shit for mats if my guild wants to make one.
---
Why are you being downvoted?
---
FYI, canonically King Varian and his friends defeated Onyxia.
---
Naxx will of course be cleared in a matter of hours after release by guilds like apes, progress, salad bakers, etc,  but you are completely out to lunch if you think naxx is going to be as easily cleared by the average raider as MC is now.  Half the guilds clearing MC right now will never even get a Cthun kill,  much less a KT kill.
---
Shamans have to re skill 2h weapons if they slec out of it
---
If ypu actually looked at it you'd know you can filter out gear sources based on category. It even filters by level if you wanna set up goals for a leveling character, though that is less useful.
---
Got'em lmao  
---
I'm just trolling bro, there's good and bad players on both sides.
---
&gt; We all understand it shows in the combat log, we understand it was that way in vanilla. 
---
So then you understand it won't change, just like Classic LFG still being a thing because the API that enables it was a thing in vanilla.
---
You're welcome moron.
---
going on a rage induced rampage in stv or some lowbie zone will prob be happening.
---
Yeah cloaking device is my #1 PvP trinket. If i'm in open world somewhere, that device is on me. I'm a mage and it allows me to get a sheep off before they even realize it. If they don't have any CC breaks that's game over with a grenade+improved counterspell CC extension.
---
Of course such a powerful effect has a 1 hour cooldown, so other trinkets fill in the gap while it's on CD.
---
You have to edit the sets to the correct phase, there is a phase 1.5 option that includes DM loot
---
Rogue &amp; priest pants, accuria dropped. I can‚Äôt remember if anything else did.
---
Hmmm, I'm not sure. I legit just did this on my priest and had to re-train all the mind flay ranks. I remember clearly because I got into an UBRS group and realized I only had rank 1.
---
Why do you hate rogues? Just learn to play around the stunlock
---
So as a fresh 60, I have Sword of Zeal, Thrash, and Mirah's. I was thinking MH thrash or Zeal and OH Mirah's. Just until I get better. Like on the list you provided.
---
Mooncloth
---
Oh what's this? A private conversation among guildmates? Better post it on reddit!
---
It kinda depends....
---
1v1
---
Vs Warrior
---
Play the long game they have no heals. Pounce&gt;Shred&gt;Rake&gt;Rip&gt;Moonfire&gt;Bearform&gt;FF. I disagree with what was stated before, catform against a warrior is extremely bad and a terrible habit to get into. The only reason anyone can get away with it atm is because 50% of warriors pre-bis is leather with 1/4 the armor of plate. A pvp oriented player is going to be full plate which means catform damage will be almost universally halved. Bleeds are not impacted by armor, get a 3-5CP Rip and play the long game. 
---
Vs Paladin
---
One of the harder matchups because of Freedom/Bubble/Heals. Open the same way as warrior if you get opener. Plate means shred/claw/FB are greatly reduced. This is a long fight again, even more a fight of endurance than warrior. The only true way to win is to oom the pally and use innervate to ultimately out manapool him.
---
Vs Shaman
---
Much the same as the pally, you can get away with more catform here because of less armor. WF is a slot machine so just remember a Shaman can pretty much 100 to zero you in a dumb luck proc. I usually bleed and bearform, wait for them to oom and they panic to escape or heal. One well placed kick can be a win.
---
Vs Hunter
---
Open same as on warrior, the trick here is they are going to try to force you to power shift a lot.... root the pet and dont powershit every slow. If the hunter is getting to far away bearform charge. Against hunter I feel like you can get away with a lot of catform as long as their pet is controlled. 
---
Vs Druid
---
Cat form all the way. Your best bet is to be the opening party. You have to try to oom them and then some because of innervate. If they bearform focus bleeds, cat caster or travel focus on using Shred/Claw and FB. Not much to way about this one. Truly just have to be more skilled or get the opener. You can do some pretty meme plays with hibernate assuming you get the breathing room to cast. If they are casting hibernate on you simply leaving form breaks the cast.
---
Vs Rogue
---
Bleed up and bearform. Always apply FF first, Always. Bearform Vs. Rogue will always win though so not a ton to say about the matchup honestly. You can use bearform to pop them out of stealth with Roar. If I know there is a rogue nearby who is looking to fight I almost always choose to start in bearform instead of playing stealth games and trying to get opener. Simply because until trinket, if a rogue gets opener on you in cat, you probably lost.
---
Vs Mage
---
Catform all day unless to kick. Mages are probably the easier match up because you can shift roots, shift slows, shift poly. Truly you kinda just lay into them with catform and win. As for opener I usually opt for Ravage over pounce because of blink, and the fact that cloth vs. Ravage usually puts them at half health and most mages will burn blink anyway.
---
Vs Priest.
---
Just avoid it? Lmao... for real though, unless they are oom or you can kite them out until they oom you probably will lose... Shadow is just so strong and their bubbles stop you from doing anything while they just ruin your day with dots and mind blast. If I am honest, I hate this 1v1 more than even warlock.
---
Vs Warlock
---
Much the same as shadow.... sadly just hard to compete with fear and dots. If he stands there and Siphons you with full dots on you there probably isnt a very good chance. Normally If I get feared away from the warlock as soon as it ends I will travel form and run away to cleanse and heal. Return and reopen. You can win but it mostly involves forcing the warlock oom by guerrilla tactics, hit and run over and over until they are forced to use lifetap, in which case you will win. If they are SL just good luck...
---
In my experience Warlock and Shadowpriest are the hardest to compete with, everything else druid stands a pretty solid chance of winning and if not has a good chance of getting away.
---
In 2v2s or larger the dynamic changes a lot though and I would say druid is most optimal filling in with heals, stuns, kicks, roots and occasionally doting. In a team fight your role ultimately is a support not a primary damage. Going in as catform will almost surely get you focused by any melle in the group and immediately killed because of a large lack of defensives.
---
r/therewasanattempt to hide their name.
---
Thats wrong
---
Lol I vote quality
---
Yea, and why are Murloc heads in Southshore such a low drop rate. I didn‚Äôt go attacking any headless Murlocs
---
&gt; anymore
---
xD
---
are you implying blizzard read tickets before? xD
---
Dude seriously it's been a rush to ding 60. I think I'm at 52 now, although I'm a lock so I'm confident I can handle 60s soonish. Plus I'll try to spend my level 55-60 grind in dungeons for BIS gear
---
Hence why I did not call it botting.
---
I called it borderline botting.
---
Notice the word "borderline", friend. It's obviously not botting. However the queueing of complex behaviors and doing quick analyses to automate tasks is *borderline*.
---
Imagine rolling on a streamer server and then complaining when the inevitable issues arise.
---
Oh god there's vomit all over my desk.
---
Capitalism baby
---
i never used it either. all the way to R13 with no issues.
---
yep
---
It was always a chat parser, now you just have to click one more button to invite people.
---
&gt;grinding your loins
---
We cleared it in epic fashion a few weeks ago... I still love MC and Im having a blast, but I was a tad let down when our 1st clear was EPIC and down to the wire, and our third kill was in 1 minute and 35seconds with 0 deaths. We're SO ready for BWL.
---
Don't get me wrong, I tested it for 14 days and then decided that I don't want it. I've been playing without it ever since. The info is pretty accurate thou usually and the information is instantaneous. I must also admit that I have been surprised a lot on my Hunter alt and the one shooting first (literally) is the one winning most of the time, especially in things like Hunter vs melee.
---
With this being classic I feel like names shouldnt be censored. It would allow specific individuals like this to build a reputation for themselves to where they couldn‚Äôt get groups.
---
just check every day a dew times a day and buy low, sell high. or if you have a lot of gold, buy low (IE if average is 50g, buy anything below that). they are literally only going to go up more and more the later the game goes on.
---
That's crazy. 
---
 Couple nights ago one of the initiates starting talking about the police were at his house becuase his uncle got drunk and tried taking his 14 yo sister while everyone was home. Going into detail about what they were telling at eachother. 
---
 I avoided gchat for rest of night lol
---
Luckily I haven‚Äôt equipped yet. Based on the comments, seems like I‚Äôm gonna be auctioning!
---
word just by dorks who want every advantage they can get except skill and awareness
---
Ok yes, wrong point to focus on. What I'm trying to say is that several people are saying it's over edited and he's just dismissing what they're saying. If multiple people all have the same opinion it must have some foundation, so why not take that onboard?
---
2 hours rested should give you 1 level a day before 50. Even still you have to account for at least 30minutes of not leveling then you got time for one or maybe 2 dungeons. Most 60s i seen have about 10 or more days played which is 200hrs+.
---
&gt;everyone assumed it was patch day. They never said it would be the 12th.
---
Yes, as you yourself point out, everybody assumed so since it's the main added component of P2 aside from two world bosses and keyring. 12th would be the logical assumption.
---
It also finds other people using the addon to make dungeons with as well. It's closer to how the M+ system in retail is.
---
Needs to be quipped the whole time!
---
Can't wait to implement world pvp... I think it's by far Best part of levelling, I used to try killing people in STV but I felt like a dick doing a 1 side offensive against passive people and stopped
---
Not everyone adheres to guides, they just want to chill with friends and bask in the nostalgia.
---
I can't wait for people who think classic raids are a joke to step into naxx. So many people are going to be eating months worth of their posts for breakfast.
---
On which server is that? I'd like to add Pushmybush to my ignore list if at all possible.
---
some classes need to relearn others not
---
&gt;nochanges
---
gahahaha
---
I am as well. Just got my mount yesterday :)
---
Sounds like the M.O for westfall (alsofromwestfall)
---
yep. what about the cringe of posting this?
---
You give honor to lvl 60s from lvl 48 so they have a good reason to farm you. I am not racing since I couldn't make it in a few days anyway but I expect life will be generally harder lol.
---
54 makes it more comfortable navigating the halls. There's so much trash everyone tries to skip, but too low and obv you can't get close. 
---
Done full run with a 52 healer though. I think they used mind soothe a lot.
---
Samezies
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre skilled but I can‚Äôt follow most fights to see your choices because of the speed ups/slow downs being way too over used. Couldn‚Äôt finish, stopped watching at 6 mins. Great first attempt.
---
my guild has 4 full raid teams that raid weekly. MTs, caster and melee dps are always flasked out. lotuses really aren't an issue unless you have problems making gold, which you really shouldnt.
---
Hell yeah cheers from bigglesworth here too 
---
I can't wait to gank some gnomes
---
its bugged.
---
I‚Äôm super passive on my dwarf but I fight everyone on my gnome. I just assume they‚Äôre going to try to gank me since so many kos any gnome they come across.
---
&gt;The reason why this crap weapon does not sell is, because it's not twink BiS. It's simply some generic dagger with crappy stats.
---
It's BiS for priests willing to go the mile for the Furbolg Medicine Pouch.
---
Nop, thats not true
---
PvP ranking system is implemented.  You get honor points for killing the opposite faction as long as they are in a certain level range with you. A level 60 can get points for killing someone as low as 48.  So if you are not level 60 you are at a disadvantage.
---
Oh yeah, that's true.  I keep forgetting I played with that shitty 1.08 patch where my 31-point resto talent was innervation.
---
Sure, there's code that differentiates the two, but likely not in the combat log.
---
Either way, it's a feature that has existed in WoW since Vanilla, and still exists in Retail.
---
To assume that Blizzard will change it after 15 years because Classic players complain is certainly optimistic.
---
If you‚Äôre planning to do the searing gorge quests for Thorium Brotherhood rep, do them before Phase 2. Nothing will be more suicidal than those.
---
You mean learn how to not get backstabbed and 1 shot every time I respawn because a rogue is corpse camping?
---
? Why do i need world or lfg to help guildies? What's gchat for?
---
You cheat and use sappers
---
Weird, theres been some pug MC and Ony runs on Alliance side.
---
I'd say theres only...i dunno, 5-6 guilds really going deep into MC at this point, but the server is at a much more casual leveling pace, so i expect it to get better over time.
---
Classic+ won‚Äôt happen.
---
That's why I wait to fire until I see the whites of their eyes. But then they're in my dead zone :(
---
yeah, its like people already forgot the old decursive. I remember after having MC on farm for a year, the night they broke the atutomated decursive, we couldn't get past lucifron, that's how bad our dispellers were, they never had to set up raid frames to show debuffs and were incapable of dispelling manually...
---
The point here is that the reply is a "canned copy-paste response that answers a lot of inventory issues". They can't be bothered to reply to every message about people who vendored things they shouldn't have over and over again.
---
its bugged and depends on class/skill
---
 **&lt;Rebirth&gt; | US PVE Pagle | Alliance | NA |**
---
**Intro** 
---
Rebirth is an Alliance PvE Guild on Pagle looking for people who enjoy the social aspect of a guild just as much as raiding and completing content. A good number of us have hit 60 and are preparing to start raiding, while some of us are still completing the leveling journey. That being said, those of us who are ready have begun to run partial guild raids of MC, so if you‚Äôre ready to raid right now we‚Äôd love to have you!
---
**Who are we recruiting?**
---
We have a great mix of veterans and newcomers who go above and beyond to help others to attain their goals, and are actively looking for like minded folks who are willing to do the same. Many of us have children and obligations outside of the game, so fast progression is not our central focus. However that does not mean that we will not give our absolute best and try as hard as possible to clear all Classic content on a more casual schedule.
---
**What classes are we looking for?**
---
We are looking to fill out our raiding roster with **warlock**, **rogues** and a **shadow priest**. But if you play something else on a more casual basis, **PLEASE** don‚Äôt let that stop you from giving us a look! 
---
Also, if there are any small guilds out there that are like us that are having a hard time doing much and would like to fold into Rebirth please contact me. We have already had 2 other small guilds do this which helps get people dungeon groups without Pugging. We have 25 to 40 people on nightly, some nights are a bit slower than others because people have kids in sports and all.
---
**What is your Raid Schedule?** 
---
Our current plan is to begin full guild runs weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays for two and a half hours each night, after the Thanksgiving Holiday. We have a slightly later start time of 8:30 PM (invites start at 8 PM) to accommodate those of us with smaller children. We plan to end between 1030 and 11, but that could be fluid based on the raid situation at the time. 
---
**How is Loot Distributed?**
---
Loot will be managed through EPGP once full guild runs begin. If you join one of the ongoing PuG raids, a random roll is used.
---
**How to join?**
---
If we seem like we may be the type of Guild you are looking for; please reach out to us. You can contact our GM HelzBelz, or our recruiting officers Abearica, Avalei or Loco in game. If we aren‚Äôt available, you can also contact us through Discord or BNet.
---
Discord: HelzBelz#0716 or DJ Roomba#1394
---
BNet: HelzBelz#1314 or DJR0omba#1252
---
I don't know, I'm sure you could write some API event call that triggers the calls to be allowed during combat, but then that requires Blizzard write whole new API's that would then cause a bunch of other API's to have to be edited, basically effecting the whole game for ***ONE*** addon.
---
I don't see it happening.
---
Do these only drop off the demons or should I be killing the succubuses as well?
---
The guy you replied to said he played 2.5 hours a day, you told him the game is not catered to casuals (implying his playtime is at a casual level). I'm telling you that 3 hours (or 2.5) a day is not even casual. That's more than a casual player would play.
---
I agree that there‚Äôs no easy solution but can‚Äôt you just track whoever is using the addon and kick them from servers? There has to be a specific data flow that‚Äôs traceable. And if you self modify the addon it‚Äôs a ban for a week or so. Sort of akin to what they do to botters but way less severe. 
---
I could be wrong, but that has to be easier than changing the entire combat log data information. I don‚Äôt have a lot of knowledge about WoW addons specifically so if it‚Äôs impossible to track client side data I‚Äôll concede your way seems to be the only way.
---
Yeah there was a searing bow on sulfuras a few weeks  ago 80g buyout and 2g Bid. I got the bid in literally right before it expired and won a searing bow for 2g lol
---
Only once you hit 40 the true grind begins then when you hit 60 the emptyness is revealed....oh which server horde or alliance? Cool man I am on rattlegore
---
Do you not understand the massive difference between breaking functionality and trying to enforce a policy based ban which has never been done in the history of the game?
---
Literally me tho
---
Pretty sure they said honor and world bosses are on the 14th, saw it here on reddit but idk if it‚Äôs true
---
Peace out you poor masochistic souls, The 0.5% ‚Äúmost fun ever PvP‚Äù guys will be riding your corpses regularly
---
God, I'm glad I transferred off that godawful server.
---
Re read your very first comment.
---
I mean, I'd put more money on higher up blizz employees reading through this subreddit than tickets marked as "Resolved"
---
I hope you reported him. This is so ugly.
---
Y‚Äôknow I suspected as much. The mp5 sounds really nice on paper, but even with all the gear + mana spring it‚Äôs still not a ton of mana regen overall. Which offhand from DM:N are you talking about?
---
Bolts of cloth. Just make sure to do it in small batches as prices seem to fluctuate a lot.
---
Stay mad
---
So as to which dungeons respawn, I think it's after dungeons after a certain level cap, not sure what the cap is, and as for times, it'll likely vary dungeon to dungeon, for reference, ZF does it, ulduman does it, so I'd think its dungeons after say level 30ish.
---
This will never work, Blizzard is giving the API to developers to say "here, build with this." Blizzard will never ban developers for doing exactly what they said you are allowed to do.
---
One layer is tomorrow though, which is what gives queues
---
Respec to Protection paladin and tank dungeons, farm the main area + prisons of BRD from 52-60. I did that and got to 60 easy.
---
They will get dishonorable kills if they're 60. They aren't gonna kill at any higher of a rate than they already do, possibly lower.
---
or you just log-reset
---
Quote me where I said TSM should be banned?
---
I'm pointing out the hypocrisy of the sub, not lambasting TSM as being bad.
---
Yea I don't pull heal aggro unless it's 3+ mobs  and there's literally no threat applied to the third+
---
.my usual roatation with new tank-wanding at the start of the pull then heals as necessary no renew shit like alot of heals I see before the pull. Healing threat is divided per mob so the more mobs the easier it is to get heal agg but battleshout or demo roar depending on pack size and party should reduce my aggro significantly . Someone also said low level tanks can use thunderclap after they charge in if need to remove excess rage  before switching stance. There is many aoe utilities even at low level
---
Rested xp is the answer here.
---
My memory tells back in the day, small group farming plaguelands and such yielded the best honor/hour.  They would just make loops or camp the flight points (your only honor-less for 10-15 secs)
---
Did you tell him to get fucked?
---
Good riddance!
---
So you think thrash/mirahs is better than zeal/mirahs?
---
I think any rational and reasonable person would know what was meant by quest item in those contexts.
---
The kos list isnt really the part of the mod that is in question.
---
I've got a max level healer and I'll be the one throwing up marks most of the time. The tanks rarely get mad even if they are targeting something else. Normally a skull is all that's needed so the dps can burn it down while the tank worries about getting agro on everything else. By the time skull is dead the hunter spamming rain of arrows or multi shot wont pull agro on the other targets.
---
&gt;Read the context I replied in. Your comment is completely irrelevant to that context and you are trying to put words in my mouth via non-sequitur.
---
nope. You said it would be 'more of a challenge'.

&gt;The "more of a challenge" is a personal guess as to why the person I replied to might not find it fun to raid with 40 people, but I cannot be sure. That doesn't mean I'm claiming any game can be hardcore. I'm sorry that your attempt at putting words in my mouth didn't succeed. Maybe you should work on your reading comprehension?
---
You should work on your honesty first. The context of the argument was that the person you were responding to did not find raiding a challenge. You then told him to use 25 people in 40 man raids. It's either your lack of reading comprehension or dishonesty at work here.
---
&gt;I'm sorry that I don't have every waking moment to reply to people on Reddit like some other people might have. I didn't know Reddit replies had an expiration timer of 24 hours!
---
For someone who pretends to be busy you sure are spamming a lot of replies.
---
&gt;How can I be "digging up old posts" when I'm simply responding to your reply to my comment? That doesn't make sense. But hey, it's not like you trying to put words in my mouth did so to begin with, so I can't say I'm surprised.
---
It makes sense because I don't only read your posts. And you put those words in your own mouth, now you're backpedaling on them. cute.
---
I see you witnessed my level 55ish Culling of Duskwood.
---
I don‚Äôt have much insight except for one point- you can coordinate with other mages and see if they are already into winters chill, maybe coordinate so that you can maybe even skip WC (or help it ramp up faster) and still retain the survivability talents
---
99.999999999999999999999999999% of your skilled wpvp, is ganking lowbies/ppl with mobs/ppl on mount/ppl drinking or outnumbering people 3 to 1
---
&gt;There are reasons as to why the best classic PvP'ers played with the combat log open at all times. 
---
only the idiots, the actual good player use the addons, that have existed since 2005
---
You can typically choose where to start with Guidelime. The only issue with some guides would be if a guide picked up a quest in one section that you don't have, you'll see certain parts of the guide "greyed out" until you either pick them up or just ignore.
---
Stockades does it
---
Talk about twisting an innocent question into something it's not...
---
Just because you felt the need to go into the guys history and determine you dont like his political views doesnt mean you need to bring it back into this sub bwhile being an asshole aboit it.
---
I mean you decided to play on the streamer server... lol
---
I can also confirm it's not working like Vanish, been using it in the Darkwhisper Gorge for weeks without issue previously. 
---
I submitted a ticket, I'll update this comment with their response.
---
That‚Äôs not true, that‚Äôs not how dishonorable kills work.
---
Everyone is litteraly playing with it on Sulfuron-FR, I find it really anti fun and really frustrating as a rogue... Sneaking/hiding is part of wow classic experience, and only a combat log with opponents auras should give such info that I gained stealth.
---
+ Of course the dementia when it comes to GvG...
---
Blizzard if you are reading this, please do like you did with the LFG addon. Classic is not like this. #NoChanges
---
Maybe I'll head over to SG today and knock some out.
---
Thinking one of the bonuses of Hinterlands is that a lot of the quests there aren't centred on certain hubs (other than the temple). It's a lot of kill quests over large areas.
---
I mean, it's kind of their job to at the very least READ the tickets they're being given, and give an appropriate response.
---
I deleted the file i previously downloaded and then redownloaded the latest release from Avianas github ‚Äî should be the one out within the last two weeks or so ‚Äî and it works now :)
---
Worked good for me. 2009 crappy laptop wouldn‚Äôt run classic until I did this and now I get 45 FPS by going from 2gb of ram to 8. Note laptop runs hot AF
---
revenge for stompin em?
---
At 46-54 you shouldn't be trying to run the whole instance, unless you're getting carried by capable players.
---
&gt; But if the civies arnt taking any damage (cause yeti)
---
The damage comes from the archers/diseases (if you arent able to dispel immediately)
---
Sure, but why doesnt vanish break combat?????????????????
---
Hello, I'm still new to WoW, what's good on phase 2? Im currently level 45 as warrior.
---
This is some r/trashy content
---
Shoulda posted his name and put him on blast.
---
Do you know how many guildies are in this guild? 
---
Do you think there's a difference between "hundreds of guildies" and thousands of redditors?
---
Do you think someone talking about her handicapped husband and his struggles is something most people would want broadcasted to the world and available to anybody?
---
I  was trying to level as fast as possible, still dinged 60 at 19.7 days played lmao. But I had all pre raid bis gear besides chest and back.
---
I guess you should make a new warrior and not be stupid this time.
---
Title.
---
correct, but you still want 5-6000 gold at launch to be able to buy your epic flying mount (5k)  immediately upon reaching lvl 70.  you will normally never make 5k during leveling
---
You will come to discover that more and more dungeon mobs respawn the higher level you get
---
I think 200 through gear is good.
---
With vanish not working atm i found it rather frustrating and i never got anywhere near 30g+ / hour like alot of people claim to gain. Going to the bar pickpocket and clear the room afterwards got me better results. Lots of greens, a blue every few runs, keys etc and equally relaxing minus the possible vanish bug.
---
I didn't have an add-on for it back then didn't know
---
Yeah, that was one of the first quests that rid me of my completionist desire on my main. Granted, this was early days after release. But there were so many people killing, and it was so hard to find all the types I needed, I was like, "You know the fuck what? I literally don't need this shit between the Barrens/the rest of Stonetalon/Ashenvale/Silverpine."
---
fuck off.
---
Little rogue bitches are crying that people are ready for them, or that they won't have time to get all the CD's up
---
&gt;However, isn't using outside programs against the TOS?
---
Wow dude, you're right! Someone needs to tell Blizzard this!
---
...
---
And no, it's obviously not. Automation of gameplay, when the game is played through no direct input from the player, is against ToS (botting).
---
But multiboxers don't automate. Every action their characters make is input themselves.
---
W-what.. They literally gave Demon Hunters the ability to talk demonic after removing it from warlocks the same expac. Then they made a potion that‚Äôs let‚Äôs you cross faction talk.
---
GMs don‚Äôt really enforce ninja looting on rolls, they usually only step in from a situation like a party leader changing the loot to ML on the fly mid fight in a raid boss and then taking off after the drop before all he‚Äôll breaks loose. However with reddit and streamers there are a lot more tools to make a case for what really happened, beyond your ticket and a chat log. So now streaming/recording is like having your own dash cam. Most of the footage is useless,but when shit goes down you have your camera. 
---
From what you are asking though, I haven‚Äôt really seen any ban come from ninja looting by winning a need roll after that person maybe said they wouldn‚Äôt roll. There is a grey area between a scammer and a ninja: GM will deal with scammers, but it‚Äôs up to the community to deal with ninjas. However, over the years I have seen a few examples of two people opening gm tickets for the soulbound item in question to find its rightful owner.
---
I don't care if you "buy it". It's extremely easy to try and I encourage each and every one of you to do so instead of believing some random person on reddit. Could be you have some other addon or setting interfering.
---
They won't give the loot. Don't waste your, and their, time. It's in their policy page, on the support website.
---
Just enable the standard nameplates via interface settings and select ‚Äúalways on‚Äù ‚Äî they were totally good enough. Good luck!
---
It would be a sweeping change to how addons work and how PvP works, far beyond banning spy or my example with pyroblast.
---
You won't be able to see enemy buffs or debuffs, for example. You won't be able to see people casting spells at all. If they animation cancel, you literally will have no indication of their attempt to cast.
---
I don't know if that is necessarily "a bad thing" but it is extremely different from how the game is played now. Kicks, Pummels, and Counterspells can currently be played reactively to enemy casts, but would have to be done by dead reckoning.
---
I know people are hyperbolic about how much changes "affect the meta" but that is pretty huge.
---
I'm genuinely curious, why would you post this to reddit?
---
They effectively shorten the lifespan of the product by doing this. I do not think they will rush P3, unless they start losing customers.
---
Transfer to Arcanite Reaper. Lowish pop, full on community.
---
Check your bank or mailbox
---
I FOUND HIM, GUYS! ^(/s)
---
There is no NA server with high pop at 60 and balance between factions. Just a fact.
---
Hey, to each his opinion, but I think you're entirely wrong on that and the majority of people would be fine with starting again, as long as *everyone* starts again. More chances for hype.
---
They get between 600-1000 comments each thread.  The only reason today's isn't higher is because it's not stickied.  Just search "Daily Questions Megathread"
---
It‚Äôs funny, Heartseeker is an alliance refugee server of transfers leaving to get away from horde dominated servers and find themselves in the position to dominate.
---
As one of these refugees I have not ganked any horde, it‚Äôs poor sport and I‚Äôve been in their shoes.
---
But phase 2 changes everything. Best of luck little one. Need my pvp gear.
---
This is very helpful, thank you!
---
Huh. For me, doing weird shit to break the game is the entire point of classic. Classic classics like Swifty's Incredible Warrior Tricks, World of Roguecraft, Zalgradis, and many others all encompassed that "solve the puzzle that is the game" playstyle. 
---
And it wasn't just classic. I remember during wotlk every serious arena player used /dump macros to get around the Blizzard macro limitations. "Creative use of game mechanics" has always been part of the spirit, I think.
---
I don't think that's true. When I find a Lotus, I log out for exactly one hour, then log back in and start doing loops. I managed 4 Lotus in 4 hours last weekend in Silithus doing this.
---
That lines up perfectly with what the old Wowhead comments say about the spawn time.
---
So pedestrian. You invite them to the group, then immediately kick them and go on to solo the mobs.
---
Remember playing a game where there was probably like 14 different types of wolves all that changed was colour and name. And nonono alpha blue wolf won't work, you need to kill angry alpha blue wolf tht is different shade of blue
---
Zeal is better than thrash if you have it
---
What should I do then? Currently I am dps/tanking with the druid and that more of my playstyle. Is that viable as well?
---
There is a lot of conflicting things here but why don't you just respec once and find out the truth?
---
No you don‚Äôt. I did this on my pally not last week. I respeced to put some points in better locations and did not have to relearn all the levels of talent abilities that I had before. For example, all my levels of consercation came back after I put the point into the talent
---
DEEEEEEEEEATH!!!!!
---
Hey bro I got my max rank lightning bolt and chain lightning at 56 come at me (58 now) /threaten
---
Gotcha. Okay thanks
---
They are bad. You are bad. Try to justify it however you want to feel better about yourself, but you're just a scrub, no doubt about it.
---
 Also, using Classic LFG as your example? Really? Blizzard already gimped it by changing the API because they didn't want it in the game. And that's your example of "they won't change the API because vanilla? Got anything else because so far you're batting 0 for 2.
---
I was about to write.. Man we get it, we read this shit every week. Last part got me haha
---
Or he may be adding a Caveat for later mistakes made?
---
Either way your issues were addressed and I'd imagine they get enough tickets of substance they have to work through without player error.
---
Lotus go for 20g here, no one flasks yet. Dreamfoil sells the most for like 14g/stack of you're lucky.
---
It would be my 3rd respect and I'd like to save my gold for my epic mount.
---
Because it's literally different from current corpse camping?  Currently camping someone doesn't give honor.  After phase 2, it will.  Pretty simple.
---
They get so many tickets they can't possibly read them all. Guy probably scanned it, saw "I keep accidentally vendoring things because I don't know what they are", picked the closest canned response he had available.
---
&gt; Huh. For me, doing weird shit to break the game is the entire point of classic. Classic classics like Swifty's Incredible Warrior Tricks, World of Roguecraft, Zalgradis, and many others all encompassed that "solve the puzzle that is the game" playstyle. 
---
I guess to me the difference is those were ingame things. They were doing ingame stuff and exploiting stuff within the context of the game. Coding up an addon externally doesn't feel in the same spirit of Swifty's Warrior Tricks imo. It's not 'creative game mechanics' imo when you're editing WoW files.
---
warlock or mage
---
Me neither, to be honest. I learned about most of that stuff during TBC when I actually got decent at the game, and when Blizzard was getting around banning half the addons and implementing the other half themselves.
---
r/murderedwithwords
---
Wrist guards of stability are awesome for fury (mc epic). Stack str/crit/ap. Str gives ap at double the str stat. Crit is 1% per 20 agil.
---
I sold them quite early to buy more mats for later content. 100% value is about 130g on my server. I sold it for 80g when elemental earth was 15-30s. Now elemental earth is already at 1,3g. 
---
At the average of 22silver per earth, I got over 300. At 300g for 1.3g an earth, I would've only gotten 230. 
---
Invest early and plentiful and you will reap an awesome reward when raiding actually starts to get expensive and farming becomes a chore.
---
This refute nothing. You quote blue posts as is they are some sort of holy text, plain dumb. That is just a PR move to calm down dumb guys with pitchforks. ClassicLFG works the same for everyone who always used it.
---
&gt; API that will significantly limit this add-on and others like it.
---
Except it didn't.
---
Pretty lame addon.
---
nah check the video, there's a 1 minute clip of time going in reverse.
---
Or I could just deal with it since none of this is vital to have, it's more that the response was littered with false information. I've been tanking without Mark and DPSing without thrash for quite some time now, I'll eventually replace what I have with something I would have replaced mark and thrash for anyway, and it won't matter.
---
No pixels in a game is enough to make me pull stuff like this on other people
---
Should my eyes be banned too?
---
Then why is the information in the combat log? Clearly Blizzard wanted the player to see it, sorry you're finally remotely balanced in WPvP...
---
You should still win most match-ups even if they know you're SOMEWHERE.
---
According to this site, whose player counts are based on raid logs, your server has one of the lowest endgame raiding populations, especially if you're unfortunate enough to be horde. https://ironforge.pro/servers/
---
No, reddit was blocked, too.
---
In addition to that mobs in dungeons don't de-aggro due to outranging them. Which basically means if you aggro a shadowsighted mob you can't ever get far enough away for Vanish to work, because they will not deaggro due to range and they will always see through stealth so once spotted you either kill it or have to die to it.
---
Please don‚Äôt steal people‚Äôs guide work and put it into third party addons without their permission.
---
That's not how any customer service suceeds.
---
Shit, if you're not in a rush, why not? Especially if it'll let you see zones you missed on your main.
---
He's saying that if you added together all of raid teams on your server and tried to flask all 40 in each raid, there literally aren't enough black lotus spawn a week to support that. Gold isn't even the issue. The  mechanic of the spawn precludes it.
---
Well anyone that names their toon that is probably a dbag anyway so just add it to ignore.
---
I can't remember from ontop of my head, but you are correct in that it's somewhere around that range. It's not very feasible to sneak up on someone using it.
---
As someone who plays on the server, I figured I'd have to give it a watch. Always enjoyable seeing others gank the same people you've been ganking.
---
How can anyone here fix anything?
---
How do you know we didn‚Äôt just hunt them all?
---
You still have the element of surprise. Other people literally can't see you until you come out of stealth. I don't know why that concept is so hard for people to grasp.
---
How is the faction balance on Incendius?
---
I was in gad last night but didn't see the quest, I'll try again though to see, if it's not available I might need to open a ticket. Thanks
---
Yes, which would break along with spy.
---
&gt; dominant 
---
I‚Äôm 100% for blizzard banning it or something, but, as long as it‚Äôs available, I will not gimp myself by not having it. Imo it‚Äôs not as good as people think.
---
It's called preparation. For when phase two rolls.
---
why not both-both ?   let servers go to tbc and at the same time keep making fresh vanilla servers.  Most vanilla veterans want to reroll every few years anyway, that's how pservers rolled and that was not bad.  if naxx is on farm too long the server dies naturally and it's better to reset it.
---

---
I mean, you are arguing with someone that thinks an Assassin's blade *might* end up being worth 120 at the high end. He clearly has no idea what he's talking about re: twinks.
---
Yeah but just go something fast in OH, you want poison appliance for PvP
---
Yup, it gets super frustrating when mobs (especially king Gordok) just continues to target you even though you use feign death. Idk what is wrong with blizzard. Game mechanics are so unreliable, that it's really getting frustrating and they won't change a thing.
---
Which naxx are you referring to private servers or Wotlk?  Wotlk undertones naxx, compared to vanilla massively even taking into account it only being a 20 man raid.
---
OK, I'll just make a WA that behaves similarly, whenever I mouse over something hostile that's non-NPC freak out and make noise...there's tons of ways around this...what are you going to do, ban mouse-over tooltip info next?
---
Only 5 or 6 MC guilds wtf
---
Nice to see some horde being killed. Keep up the good work!
---
Yes... it finds that information by... ***parsing chat***.
---
Did you see the comment of the guy talking about the add-on's they had in Vanilla?
---
The addon that auto-decursed the entire raid without player input? The addon that auto-healed when you or one of your party reached a certain HP, complete with auto downranking for the most optimal heal? Or how about the Spy addon that scanned your combat log and informed you of nearby players that just activated stealth? Yup, all were a part of Vanilla! 
---
Blizzard ended up saying "we are not bringing back Vanilla add-on coding because of how broken it was" 
---
This addon was a part of Vanilla, it's a part of classic. It's not broken, it doesn't ruin the fun as you still have to FIND and KILL the enemy. This add-on doesn't do that for you.
---
Imagine thinking the element of surprise is there when a whistle is being blown and the game tells you a rogue is near by.
---
How Ironic ‚ÄúMuphry‚Äôs‚Äù law
---
You literally can't read. There's an internal ecosystem outside of the chat parses for users of the addon.
---
I know this, because I use it.
---
12 days played in two months is 72 days played in a year. OP has 7 days played in one year of BFA prior to classic. 
---
On OP‚Äôs BFA play schedule, he‚Äôd be like a level 28-30 in classic right now. That would be considered extremely casual by most standards.
---
Yeah, so is literally all the information Spy uses, it's in the combat log lol...
---
Only that ?Some say 12? Crit looks pretty important to lock ruin
---
They're busy helping people with actual issues, and closed your ticket the easiest way possible. Their CS is succeeding just fine.
---
How do they work?
---
what happens when you kill someone on it?
---
You have the burden of evidence, not him. YOU made the claim, now back it up
---
Take this down it sucks
---
I'm pretty sure it's not even possible. The blizzard API is just a stream of data going out. The only thing blizzard sees is that "client x connected to y application interface"; it has no easy server-side way of knowing how that data is being used.
---
Can you link another post? I've not seen it before and you seem a bit buzzkill-y.
---
So yesterday on Nethergarde around 19:50, we're all flying out of SW after getting our Ony buffs on the way to go kill her again. Someone says there's a load of Horde piling into Menethil. GM laughs and says it'll probably take them at least half an hour to get to IF.
---
So we smash the Dragon and are back in IF by 20:10, only to find around 30 or so Horde in the throne room. Guess they weren't expecting a fully buffed raid group to show up because they got deleted.
---
Half an hour later, The Finest, Nerf Inc and about 15 PuGs have formed a counter raid and we're on our way to Org. We managed to get Thrall down to around 30% before wiping. Would probably have been more if more of the raid was on Discord. Then we res'ed and camped the FP for around 20 minutes. When it became obvious you guys were too chicken to launch a counter attack we made a glorious suicide run to the AH roof as is customary.
---
Not bad for a PvE server.
---
It is really easy to fabricate a screenshot and drag someone's name through the mud. R3 helps to prevent this.
---
Just make sure to hold the logout timer sacred, else if you hit the lock out timer when offline, you get teleported back to your hearth. Just yesterday I got ported to Gadgetzan (Farming ZF) from BRD arena runs. Had to find a WL in Kargath to summon me back for a gold.
---
Only reason that's not great is that you picked thrash blade over an amazing bow.
---
Those kinds of people aren't human.
---
Some blues you should have saved, selling them that low is just plain silly.
---
&gt;Invest early and plentiful and you will reap an awesome reward when raiding actually starts to get expensive and farming becomes a chore.
---
To a degree, some blues only morons would sell at this point, they will blast up in price.
---
I suggest you check out the goblin subs on tips on playing the market. You will stop making silly mistakes.
---
We can see that he needed right above the rolls, just need server
---
Sounds like something a witch would say...
---
He swore at me so I told on him. Nobody likes a tattle tale. Gonna cry?
---
I farm lashers, herbs and satyrs ( usually 3 packs and some rogue satyrs). Found only 1 book so far and no epics. Still good income. You also collect those sprouts for +10 int food, I have around 3 stacks of them for 1 round of farming (full bags).
---
Wish I could afford to mb 5 characters, that would be badass
---
Legit farmers do not want to fight big numbers because they could die... the same will happen in bgs. I‚Äôd even guess legit premades xfaction collude to try and dodge as much as possible.
---
Here‚Äôs the truth
---
hahahahaha oh sweet summer child
---
Yup, in my own play I think track is about 35y-40y range when you can see a dot on your minimap, that‚Äôs about the same as what the addon does.
---
It‚Äôs like everyone has a 24/7 track humanoids up basically
---
Aren‚Äôt epics/blues that u win (and u forget to loot) mailed to you?
---
uh sure but I'm stealthed so I just don't let then do that
---
Seems like it would be a simple enough change for blizz to create an in-game cast bar and kill Spy. But that is just my #changes perspective. I'm not some purist that thinks vanilla could actually use no improvement.
---
Ah unfortunate. Tbh the idea the other guy proposed seems easier anyway. I just know Blizzard has seemed very lazy with classic right now so was just hoping for something, whatever is easier for them.
---
What kind of team clandestine operations in enemy territory are you running?
---
How do you even get ony buff with everyone and their dog farming ony heads and popping them at random times? The only time I saw SW entrance without the head is when it was bugged and the buff wouldn't trigger anyway.
---
Edgelord
---
You will:  
---
\- Die less  
---
\- Be sooner at dungeons (especially. usefull for warlock)  
---
\- Make more gold by gathering/skinning   
---
\- Get away from gangs better  
---
list goest on...  
---
Its worth every penny
---
As a second thought if you see ‚ÄòPinacolada‚Äô or something like that, horde mage I think undead, please twat him. I‚Äôd pay gold to see that on video. If you can then camp him for an hour or two as he does to low level alliance that would be perfect!
---
The LFG tool that literally just parsed the LFG channel and organized it, just like multiple addons did back in Vanilla?
---
You people are a pathetic joke.
---
Pray tell, how do you think Blizzard should "ban" the Spy addon...I'd love to hear.
---
That's awesome! Thanks for the info, a melee disc priest would've been amazing.
---
Yes.....i know.....the fireballs  
---
my issue is picking up threat after she lands again.  
---
i have tried the clumping up to stop the aggro drop

Wait until you get out of high school. Adults actually get off on putting punk ass bullies in their place.

Ahhhh man, I knew this existed.  I just procrastinated and didnt want to spend time figuring it out because I would rather spend limited time in the evenings playing (you should see my UI, its a joke hahahaaha).
---
But in short.  I have Prat.  I need to create two separate windows so I can see them at the same time.  When you say right click on channel name?  Is that the line of text?  Or click on the tab a the top?  Will check this out tonight.  Thanks!
---
Because that's how it fucking was in Vanilla, what happened to #NoChanges? Hypocrites.
---
7 days is generous too.. it‚Äôll likely be closer to 10 for the average player
---
Eh. There isn't much gear for Fury war in MC. Just weapons and maybe ring/cloak. Expecting to get geared as a fury war is extremely unrealistic and demonstrates ignorance on the statting of gear
---
Considering Classic's simplicity, If you're willing to spend $1k would suggest shooting for something with a [high refresh-rate IPS screen](https://www.myfixguide.com/laptops-144hz-screen/) because basically anything with a dedicated card and an i5 will be capable of blowing past 60 FPS on high/ultra and you're gonna wanna take advantage of the smoothness.  That's really where the difference is IMO, as most people have said anyone can run wow. 
---

I got a HP Omen just cause of the 144 hz Gsync screen cause I know I only play the same old games I've played for 15 years.

---
You have commented this several times, and I cannot understand why you are so adamant about likening this incredibly expansive addon to the comparatively incredibly limited combat log.
---
*to be expected from a community that has been playing this game for a decade and a half*
---
Wailing Caverns respawn but it takes quite a while but that dungeon takes a while if you're doing the whole thing sometimes the mobs inside the entrance will. I did notice SM is pretty quick at respawning
---
So... he's got today, right?  Doesn't phase 2 start tomorrow?
---
From what I've seen, you farm them for when needed but you dont really need to farm 20 every raid. The dps increase is pretty damn nice but it's only 30 secs and you arent always going to be attacking on every fight the full time. Basically grab a few for when you know you can go full ham on a boss. Dont use them on dungeons or trivial bosses
---
How weird. Does appear to be really inconsistent based on the comments here. I've respecced every week for the past 2ish months and had to rebuy the ranks everytime. Jeez, that 5g I've spent on ability ranks is really going to add up on top of the 100's I've spent on respec costs /s lol.

The priest tricket from dm and mindtap are the best... typically  unless you have enough spell power you need to use rank 4 holy nova. (The mobs have 100 hp) I'm also pretty  sure the debuffs  are disease  based  so you need abolish. Rank 4 flash and renew should do the trick. Oil of immolation and holy strath water also help to kill the mobs and not waste mana on holy nova. The trick is to not dumb mana saving every  single one  in a pack. You might lose one or two.
---
You are the reason Nightfall Axe  exists.
---
Offtank life becomes reasonable when you are trying to get Nightfall axe procs and increase magic DPS by 15%.
---
Well, also that spy will tell you their exact *minimum* level based on any skill they used and its rank.
---
It basically gives every player a track humanoids for free, as a hunter who already has it it kinda sucks
---
A lot of the people that were talking up rushing to 60 did it before launch. They're all too busy rn finishing up getting their full T1 so they can light up us poor 48-59 folk.

Mara is where it‚Äôs at! Tons of exp and princess runs to get your ring fast

This video is right on time  5/5  will watch again
---
You know what I've noticed about high end raiders and gankers like &lt;APES&gt; is that they are not actually _playing_ the game.  They are ignoring a lot of the game. Quickly.  Whereas in this video, in your game play, you are actually _playing_ the game.
---
I can see your attitude towards pvp change as you are playing it.  I can see timeless qualities in your STV.  And the music... the music speaks to the collective subconscious of all of us who just breath in the game.
---
People like &lt;APES&gt; just want to be able to say the already beat the game.  But to me, that's like saying they want to be able to beat breathing.
---
:)
---
:up:
---

---
Typically there are at least 2 winters chill mages in raid, and the others are arcane power spec for max dps. 
---
So the most ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù build between PvP/PvE is winters chill build.
---
Read that back to yourself.
---
but how long do you want to sit on your 9/9 t3?   I have been on Chr√∂n√∂s  1  since the beginning and Naxx is out there since 2017 or (2016?) or so .  Even before classic was launched it meant that almost nobody kept playing and the server dropped to &lt;100 people online.   
---
A Fresh start  (√ár√≥n√≥s 3) was needed  to retain the playerbase.   
---
Of course, you should have the time to join the fruits of your  labour and a server should keep going for some time to give people the opportunity to play with everything maxed out. But within a year people quit anyway, so that's when it's a good idea to reset  to lvl 1 vanilla or move to TBC
---
The term child molester is its own negative word. A child molester is obviously a piece of shit. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to say ‚Äúhey child molester, you‚Äôre a piece of shit‚Äù, as it‚Äôs already implied by them being, you know, *a fucking child molester*.
---
They have to graduate up the ladder to being simply a piece of shit. His scale is fine.

&gt; Blizzard is not going to break hundreds of mods for this one, sorry.  
---
I feel they would if they feel it's the right thing.
---
Imagine being this bad, holy shit.
---
It might be sad to be a sheep. What if a big corporation wants to manipulate you? At least it's just a game.
---
I was using the addon. Blizzard says they will butcher it. I'm still using the addon as always. Same core features, no meaningful changes. It never worked like WotLK as some other dumb guy keep spaming in this thread. It was never banned as some other dumb guys posted. Blizzard manipulated the herd.
---
I'm planning on killing bots. There's so many of them now it's gonna be some ez honor
---
Yes, its only efficient for rogues when doing the Silithus runs, Druids are good aswell.
---
I'm my guild's Spriest, so actually I was going Shadow -&gt; Heal -&gt; Shadow for stuff like the Bene questline, or Shadow -&gt; Shadow to test out new specs.
---
You‚Äôre proving his point....
---
People who rush to 60 have no reason to care about guys taking it slow. Until they impact the schedule of phases, their playstyle has zero impact on you.
---
The opposite however is not true though. If you're taking it slow, you might experience things like being ganked by 60s in full raid gear or seeing every good item priced way out of your range because there's a bunch of guys on the server swimming in gold.
---
you have to free gnomeregan first before the gnomes let you in on their secrets

Gehennas-EU... on alliance atleast EVERY dungeon group is mostly swedes...

Phase 2 is going to be frustrating for PVPers IMO. The servers can‚Äôt handle massive battles and raiding cities gets you nothing but DKs. I really wish they‚Äôd remove DKs and just make certain mobs unkillable if they‚Äôre that important.  This phase is just gonna be ‚Äúgank the questers‚Äù instead of any flavour of real open field PVP. 
---
So yeah I totally agree we will see WSG released before the full phase 3 and likely soon ish.

Bags always sell quick. They won't get you a ton of gold at a time, but you can create 2 bags per dungeon run. On my server Runecloth bags go for 2.5 - 3g per, and they ALWAYS sell.
---
As a resto druid... As feral you bite them and kite when you need to heal.
---
So what does phase 2 have to do with level 48??
---
Oh then it was deserved. Kill any undead they'll deserve it eventually
---
The game still won't let me rename my pet.
---
Repair gold sync haha
---
We had 200.. and still couldn‚Äôt make a dent. Absolutely disheartening. Competing for world resources is going to be tough for us Alliance, let alone PVP
---
From my experience, mobs that pat seem to respawn first.
---
I like when you MC them, they suddenly want to smash Gordok Battle Mage.
---
Literally at 48, only have one character and have spent a decent amount of time playing. 
---
Seems I'm moving with the herd
---
New pre-raid BIS gear is being introduced that can be earned by ganking the most 48+ players on your server.
---
The thing is: They very much are, which is the scary part.
---
Everybody is able of doing horrible thing if the right conditions and circumstances are met. Nobody is born a loot ninja or a child molester, something made them that way. So in a different universe that could be me or you.
---
As such dehumanising them is probably not a good idea.
---
But elemental mastery ;)
---
Thank you, this is what i was looking for.
---
It even worked for your post.  I thought you named the button on your keyboard that you use for your pet for reasons, and I was wondering where that crazy action lead.  As in naming the "e" key "eeky".
---
Pretty good for conflag spec in MC lol
---
I have a druid friend who is my level who heals and i read that arena/prison brd is good. But on wowpedia and wowhead i don't see this mentioned. Do i need a key or how do i get to these two areas to grind? Thanks for the help!
---
I miss autotravel! Truly the golden age of UI add-ons.
---
Incorrect, they totally do item restoration. Several guildies have had stuff restored so it's very possible they might do it in this case too.
---
A very good low IQ rebuttal, you sure made your point :)
---
Doesn't really bother me on a Druid, except for the fact that it makes Track Humanoids worthless. I absolutely hate it on my Warrior because if someone has this addon and wants to camp my corpse, they can.
---
Spy is the nerfed version already.  VanasKoS was able to detect people much further away and you could target people while in combat.
---
Blizzard should stop being so hands off with shit like this and take action, "the community will fix the problem" isn't a proper solution as everything clientside can easily be faked and people can get falsely accused, only blizzard can see real serverside logs proving someone did something and this is a clearcut case of a leader ninja looting, i say gold/inv wipe and 1 week ban first offense at least for shit like this.
---
The odds of finding the person in this image are worse than the odds of finding the same name on the wrong person on a different realm.

The fact that you even fathom this as a viable solution is mind-blowing.
---
Yup I‚Äôm against threat addons and dbm type stuff too. Anything that can change gameplay that much should be provided by blizzard for everyone or none at all. Right now cause everyone has it you need it too or you are willingly screwing yourself
---
\*Reads\*
---
&gt; I have done a fair bit of research and have good enough gear to go fury/prot 
---
\*Looks at gear list\*
---
Ummmmmmm, no. No you do not.
---
Maybe you are losing threat because you are grouping with DPS that have better gear than you, but that doesn't mean it is time for you to go fury/prot. 
---
If your end goal is to go fury/prot then i'd suggest watching videos here:  [https://www.youtube.com/skarmtank](https://www.youtube.com/skarmtank)
---
AQ and Naxx consumables obviously
---
Thats on the assumption you have to put your gold into assassins blade OR other things. You can do both.
---
What you did isn't "wrong" or "bad", it just wasnt the most sound option as a classic goblin.
---
If you don't care about optimizing your gold making and want to do it casually, thats great too!
---
all im saying is if you want to step your gold making up, check out the other subs, they will give you really helpful tips. I suggest anybody wanting to make gold in general check it out!
---
I'm a lowly level 43! what am I supposed to do? everyone said enjoy leveling and take your time and I was foolish enough to listen. this is my downfall. I'll see you on the other side.
---
I suppose lmao.
---
Spellpower is the most important stat for mages. I would stick with the Witchblade and Spirit. But keep the staff too. It's better for farming.
---
You can also tell by mounts if they have it
---
That's not how curse reporting works. 
---
If someone gets x reports in y minutes the automated silencer kicks in for cursing. No human ever looks at those reports and it does not effect their gameplay. This is true of classic and retail.
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
Spamming UBRS for Briarwood reed is also a good idea.
---
I think his point is that split DPS between a tank target and a single target everyone else hits vs everyone just doing whatever is still a net improvement. Also if someone wants to mark targets you can just do it before the engage and ask tank to engage on skull with everyone else.
---
They are the same exact thing from a programming standpoint, this the issue.
---
Amen. I write them a modmail when this happens but guess nobody cares.
---
Again: **THEY WARNED YOU NOT TO DO THIS** months ago.
---
High quality bait.
---
There are always rogues and druids nearby. The range is so large that it even picks up people on flight paths. Almost none of them actually attack and its still a surprise when they do. No one is going to sit in one place spamming AoE trying to find you.
---
I honestly doubt that it will hit 3000g. Selling stuff early and buying mats that will increase by 20 times its current value is better as long as you can hold out and have all stuff crafted and are set up for other content.
---
If you are threatend of being benched in your raid, because you don't bring the proper consumes and dont have the gold, by all means, sell now and buy stuff you need. If you aren't in a hurry, sell an assassins for 300g now and invest into items that will net you 6000g from the 300g you invested.
---
Dungeons are a much better way to level than trying to hide in Winterspring.
---
Vs most meele you're gonna put on full dots and then kite around in bear form. No feral druid is kiting with moonfire and insectswarm unless you're wearing full int gear.
---
Probably because they failed to raid org, then we went to SW. Might have went to IF too, I had to get off shortly after though, so im not sure how it unfolded.
---
It is a viable solution because the vast majority of people stop doing something as soon as the company says it's bannable. You must be new.
---
I believe so, but I know people will still prefer a warrior 
---
That being said, I don‚Äôt play Druid, these are just the things I see in raid, and we have a bear off tank and a feral spec dps, and we clear mc and Ony in a single night 
---
We also have a Druid healer or two as well
---
Wow that‚Äôs fucked up by the leader.

Ah, well we did use the Greater Fire Resist Pots (at 2 per fight) and the FR gear. Which is likely why it was so smooth.
---
A couple weeks more gearing, with others getting their pre-BiS outside raid will have us doing a no sons run. He was ~25% when he submerged I believe.

The quest is low-level. You won't see it above his head. Just talk to him.

---
I use and spam the default sit/stand binding. It works most of the time. You know you are stacking when you get a redoubt proc.
---
 You get crit since you're sitting but due to spell patching delay the hit registers whilst you're standing.
---
A guy who is supporting retail-esque addons is telling me to go back to retail LOL
---
No not necessarily. If there is no automation, then no. Using software to send a manual keypress to multiple wow instances is not considered automation.
---
Yeah man, just log on at 4am and maybe you won't get zerged that one time, it's not so bad!
---
If no one is focusing you, cat is far from useless.
---
Don‚Äôt you get dishonorable kills for killing below that? I think that‚Äôs why 60‚Äôs won‚Äôt be messing with lowbies after P2. Also, if they truly want to grind honor, they wouldn‚Äôt want to waste time.
---
Bruh you're making a fool of yourself. I hope your guild doesn't know you're this big of a fucking idiot.
---
Literally any graphics card that isn't a potato will run classic comfortably 60fps+ on high settings. My work PC which is an i5 8gb with no graphics card runs it up to 80fps on 5/10 (medium) settings
---
Except the queues went away and are rarely seen in the evenings now. Removal of layering might change that but it's still not so bad. I'm on Herod, first few weeks were tough with queues, I just signed in and waited while I did other things. Then we went weeks without a queue, a couple weeks ago they were back on Tuesday and Wednesday but I haven't seen one on a Friday or weekend in quite some time.
---
I just raid log so its not worth it for me. I just bought some expensive recepies instead to slowly earn cash over time.
---
I just hit 50 this weekend... just waiting for it to begin Haha
---
He doesn't even need to wait that long.  They'll probably jump in the next few weeks.
---
I don't see how it could be even worse than it currently is. Anywhere close to a dungeon is littered with bones. The path from nethergarde keep to Swamps of sorrow is also a boneyard on weekends. There are people corpse camping to timer-lock in Feralas, Azshara and Felwood every day. Killing people as a level 60 is a popular sport in STV.
---
I don't think adding the honor system will change world PVP that much.
---
Girlfriend sold a pendulum of doom for 1100g the other day, they definitely sell to those preparing bg twinks
---
This is correct you will need to defeat domo again. His minions can drop boe epics though.
---
These addons don't work in retail. If you're wanting to make classic be like retail just go play it.l
---
Yes, which is exactly why they're far cheaper than regular spells.
---
Bro find any example of someone having had a positive experience with Blizzard customer support in classic. My Guild master fought for weeks before giving up when someone stole his name to fuck with him and just has it on an unplayed level 1 toon.
---
Hmm okay. Based on the comments, it sounds like there might be a time requirement to relearning the ranks that I was unaware of? I usually do a few days shadow, a few days disc, so maybe that's long enough for me to "forget" the ranks. Versus if you're just respeccing to move some points around in shadow and re-learn Mind Fly 5 minutes after losing it.
---
Is that the legendary female orc player ??
---
Well, fuck rogues my dude
---
Anyone saying this addon takes the skill out of the game is just mad they can't ambush a player that isn't ready for combat.
---
If anything this addon makes each pvp encounter show who is more skilled. Both players are ready for combat and no one gets to get an unfair ambush.
---
LBRS is good for leveling. Rip the beginning quests in WPL if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
&gt; some people get REALLY offended over nothing these days
---
We obviously can't prove it, but would you say that people who do these kind of things in games are more likely to do them in real life as well?
---
1v1 vs hunter, you just don't fight because Mana drain still isn't fixed and you will 100% lose vs any competent hunter.
---
The only person talking out of their ass is you, if you actually work in the industry I'd be surprised if you were more then 6 months into working in it.
---
It was a pug. I won a roll on an item fair and square with in game mechanics and because the raid leaders malicious intent, I missed out on the item. 
---
I opened two tickets and they both fed me the same bullshit answer.
---
From their perspective this was a positive experience. A bullshit ticket was submitted, they got rid of it with the least mount of hassle and expense they could manage. Done and done.
---
It is enough to get to 60 for some, but the average time is more like 10 days /played assuming you're not following a guide or anything
---
behold: the kind of person that flips out on retail workers when wal-mart is out of cool ranch doritos
---
Yeah that won't be abused at all. Let's just buy everything that is lower on another server and transfer back every two weeks
---
I am on Pagle Alliance
---
I didn't even know just how ridiculous Spy actually was until I installed it myself. I feel so much safer leveling on a PvP server with it on. I find it lame, won't lie, but it is just too useful.
---
My main is a rogue and I don't care if people know I'm coming. I never found it to help them that much.
---
Yes, you can't see the peasants or skeletons if you don't have it equipped.
---
On the other hand, if another priest has the eye equipped they can do the quest for you (even if they already have bene and got an extra eye). Though you have to keep your distance in this case I think.
---
Paladins are the worst tanks in WoW.
---
They don't have taunt. Even in BC, we had to use macros to get around how our taunts worked backwards.
---
We also had to get hurt to get mana back, so no "#2 on threat". Prot pallies were masochists.
---
Druid tanks are the best, since your Feral tank gear and dps gear overlap significantly and you can make threat without getting beat on.
---
That'd be a reportable offense, though. If you agree upon terms in game and he follows through with the mail, he can report you for scamming him.
---
Well if you really want the experience intended by the devs, then yes, you aren‚Äôt supposed to see enemy buffs wihmthout detect magic, that‚Äôs why detect magic was in the game.
---
You also not supposed to see enemy spell casts. I mean it makes sense though, why is it a warrior for example knows what a mage is casting? To them it‚Äôs just jibberish. Like you can see a mage casting, but you might not know what spell
---
I opened to two tickets and both gems said that they are completely hands off in terms of loot in classic. I will not be getting the head.
---
Sounds like this is the perfect answer. Thanks man!
---
Can't you report him?
---
I was telling my guild about this post yesterday. I remember it very vividly. "Yes a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot porn directly to your computer"
---
Personally I would say checking the most nodes the fastest is your best bet. Winterspring and EPL are super spread out. In Burning Steppes and Silithus you can check every spawn within a couple minutes. Check the nodes that are clustered together more frequently than the ones that are out of the way. When you get one, write down the time and layer off or go to another zone for ~45mins.
---
Seems to me like you both agree though...
---
unless someone links the exact quote, it's safe to assume it doesn't. people like to say "this is against tos!!" all of the fucking time against anything fun but can't actually show evidence.
---
This. I opened two separate tickets and they said they have not and will not interfere with classic loots.
---
People are saying they won't disable it because it breaks a large part of how the combat log works. When they broke healbot and decursive they broke EVERY mod that worked that way. That's fine because they didn't want automated spell choice. To fix spy they'd have to break things they aren't ok with breaking.
---
Exactly this.
---
I‚Äôm well versed in every single matchup on my pally (even have a frost resist set), but if I‚Äôm a betting man I‚Äôm taking an equally skilled mage vs an equally skilled pally 10 times out of 10.
---
There‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop them from sheeping and resetting the fight. Granted, I do beat my fair share of decent frost mages, but only because I have a deathbringer it opens me up to using skull of impending doom.
---
Vs a frost mage that‚Äôs equally skilled as me no chance, I consider it almost a hard counter.
---
&gt;First blizzard creates a  faction specific login queue so that the imbalance isn‚Äôt worse than 55-45. So if you are on a 80/20 server you will have to wait to login and play, if you are the 80% side. That is the incentive to move.
---
Lol what? I picked server the first day and sticked to it. Why should I be punished and be in an "imaginary" for something out of my control which faction other players choose to play when logging in to raid etc. That is not really what I pay for. Now I don't even know the ratio on my server but anyway why should some people have extra queue for ONE aspect of the game?
---
Im a rogue, I‚Äôm the apex predator
---
Yeah like how pawn would tell you that the stats on one item may be better than what you have on. Like for my warlock alt if it‚Äôs better trade off my shadow power gear for one that has better overall stats. (Ex. Lv 35 piece with +21 shadow dmg vs. lv 45 with int/spirit/Stam etc)
---
Everyone focusing the tanks target vs everyone focusing a healer or the "correct target" is still split dps
---
 it's not everyone doing what they want vs a "tank Target and single Target", it's a single target (tanks target) vs  split dps.
---
show me where exactly in the tos it says this. please, show me.
---
I opened two tickets. If you can have a guildie hit me with a link to classic item restoration I‚Äôll try it.
---
I assure you he is alive and well.
---
You think the people he has dirt on want his dead man switch going off?
---
Yea... he;s definitely alive in Argentina or Israel or some other place. Dude isn't dead from murder or suicide.
---
What if they charged $10 to transfer back?
---
It does if you're not completely clueless.
---
It‚Äôs already started on Netherwind and it currently doesn‚Äôt pay at all... god help us.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I said to the gms. I didn‚Äôt get the item due to human interaction. Not because of an in game mechanic.
---
It was always useless for anything other than PvE or really really bad PvPers.
---
I don‚Äôt lol

No shit

---
Blizzard has not done any updates to the API to break anything related to ClassicLFG (aside from protecting the SendWho function which would only require a hardware event and would not be necessary when interacting with other users of the addon, and was probably not targeted at this addon).  The author removed the auto-invite functionality before classic was released.  
---
`InviteUnit` is the function in question, and is not protected or secured in any way.  You could even revert the changes made by the author to bring the auto-invite functionality back for yourself.
---
As long as it‚Äôs before the boss dies Im pretty sure you can. 
---
[seems like these people thought so](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpke74/can_you_change_loot_rules_while_in_combat/)
---
What‚Äôs your solution?
---
lol, well you are a fool because there arent any 2 handers in BWL worth taking over Hand of Rag.
---
Absolutely. And I did for about a month until I finally got dr mh on my 53rd rend kill. Next Viskag is mine. I promise you zeal is significantly more dps than thrash blade. Krol blade is fine, too, but you need the hit rating to back up any extra crit; since you'll probably be around 32-34% crit world and raid buffed. But you won't realize that crit on your autos until you add quite a bit more hit than the soft cap.
---
 added in an edit
---
Xfers should be plainly restricted to servers w/ a faction balance even more poorly skewed towards the player's faction.
---
Trash mage
---
What if OP was being a cunt and needing on things that they didn't need and the party kicked him for that? We only have one side of the story.
---
I exaggerate a little, but I've seen that post soooo many times.
---
I feel like I've seen more people complaining about complaining, than people complaining. Anyone else? Where are these tidals waves of people who chose PVP realms that are crying about P2's arrival?
---
remind warlocks to cast detect invisibility
---
Having this addon won't change that. Skull lvl rogue is still gonna kill you.
---
It's not that it's bad not to be level capped, it'll be "less" bad at 60 once phase 2 hits. People are still gonna jump you to get that sweet, sweet honor. But at least you have a chance at having a 100% mount to get away.  
---
Those 60s that have a regular 60% mount? That's just a big bullseye and you might as well be in the presenting position.
---
It'd be great if he /yelled his kill count too
---
Pushmybush with a bad decision
---
In my opinion blizzard should ban all addons and implement what ever things they want players to experience themselves.
---
So if they think cast bars are fine, make their own one and put it in for everyone. If damage meters and ah add on is fine, then put it in.
---
It did exist in Vanilla, you knew exactly what he meant.
---
Do you have any tips for trying to grind these solo? I'm 31/20/0 and having a tough time with them. I can't really afford to respec atm.
---
At LEAST 21% crit in defensive stance. 
---
600+ AP.
---
6% hit with your edgemasters.
---
Also, you're in blues.  Fury/Prot is a dps spec in defensive stance. Your TPS is directly related to how much damage you do. 
---
Deep Prot is static threat that scales up a lot better at your gear level. Shield slam is X threat + block value (and is affected by crit).
---
You're also gearing somewhat for defensive stats (Talisman of evasion, Boots of Avoidance, Helm of Awareness).
---
Couple links for you:

[A proper BIS list for you](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?sle=true#)  
---
[Video Detailing WHEN you should go Fury/Prot by Skarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ0HrEklWjI)  
---
TL;DR You go prot when your raid's threat is too high to be handled with Deep Prot (800+) and when you have the gear for it. Anything before that and your threat is **SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS DEEP PROT ESPECIALLY IN DUNGEONS**

Fair warning, If you go into the Fight Club Discord at the bottom of that BIS sheet and you walk into #tank-chat with your current set of gear and as fury prot and without having read the FAQ or the pins in the channels, you're gonna get flamed.  The info there is invaluable, but for the love of god don't come in there and be all "Hey guys i'm fury prot in blues with avoidance pieces and my threat sucks plz hlp".
---
I bet the little shit was so fuckin‚Äô pissed, glorious haha
---
People will accept it anyway, so it's fine.
---
What other evidence is necessary than the loot was dropped, a person clearly wanted it, that person was kicked, and the party leader rolled on it?
---
TAAAZ'DINGOO
---
The point is that you habitually delete items without thinking and GM's give canned responses somewhat relevant to your issue.
---
Thanks I found him! Tinkerwiz in ratchet, might not have question mark over the head depending on the level. Thanks for the help!!
---
Dbm is pve amd doesn't affect people who don't have it.
---
It was saposta be on master loot. But they didn‚Äôt do it and when loot dropped t was a free for all. I wasn‚Äôt the only one who rolled on the ‚Äúreserved‚Äù head. They kicked everyone that rolled on it in hope to having the loot reset and have it be looted by the intended player. 
---
Had they not kicked me, and were honest and decent about it, I would have given it to the raid leader. They were malicious and that caused me and them to miss out on the head. 
---
This is one of two reasons I‚Äôm stepping back from classic.
---
This doesnt seem like fun at all.
---
It is automation because you're not pressing x keys. You're pressing 1 key, and a 3rd party computer program is simulating the rest.
---
It's not punishable because Blizzard is hypocrites to their own 1 press = 1 action definition.
---
&gt; It might be sad to be a sheep.
---
hinterlands was by far the best for me for mithril
---
Hmm I just did it yesterday for the first time. I can't remember how now though. Somehow it unlocked all the UI elements and I have able to resize them all.
---
The GM seems to know what he is doing, he is explaining that he cannot restore those items for you. Looks like hes trying to pass on the info that you should be more careful when deleting items.
---
In regards to changing appearence of a character, they will not do this. If they did they would have to add a barbershop.

Im still level 20 man, you're going to kill me whether i like it or not

I really thought p2 will be in december, just dinged 50, it's gonna be hell now
---
I was saying with the cloth he gets from Dungeon Runs/Farming. A stack of Leather is cheap on my server (around 1.5g per stack), which equates to 5ish Silver per bag, +45s for the cloth. 50s in mats and sell them for 2.5-3.0g. Netting at least 2g every bag, and never have to worry about not selling.

Hey everyone! We're a casual raiding guild looking to fill out our main raid roster. We raid on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 7:30pm server to 11pm-12am server. We're currently running joint-raids with other small guilds to get our core members geared up and ready to farm MC on a weekly basis.
---
We're currently recruiting any and all level 60s who want to step into the Molten Core, whether it's your first time or 100th time! We're also accepting anyone still leveling in the 50+ range :)
---
Our guild atmosphere is laid-back and dedicated to helping members with activities such as attuning to raids and pre-bis gearing!

Why she got a lazy eye though?
---
Strange bug. But nothing in Classic surprises me anymore.
---
Can you upload the video?
---
Blizzard has made no changes to "break" any parts of ClassicLFG specifically.  The author removed the auto-invite functionality before classic was released.  You can easily modify the code to turn that feature back on.  
---
The only API change blizzard has made since this post was made was protecting the `SendWho` function, which most believe as to target either ClassicCensusPlus or the the gold spamming chat channel invites.
---
Damn, you're really using child molesting in your straw man argument? Bruh
---
Is there an engineering guide that takes into account switching from gnomish to goblin? What are the must have gnomish trinkets?
---
It‚Äôs not a witch hunt with clear evidence.
---
 detect invisibility works on invisibility, not stealth btw. Paranoia the buff from the felhunter, in fact, does, however.

This is some high lvl noob stuff right here

It is in fact, Bartender.

No... have you tried using this tool they provide?

I would have harassed that man daily fuck that neck beard shit, ruining community games
---
The other side of it is you can make loads of gold doing menial gathering for the 60s swimming in gold. For example, oily blackmouths are worth loads of money on PvP servers because free action potion. I imagine it's not worth the time of the 60s who have better gold farms available to them, but you can be getting oily blackmouths in darkshore at level 10 and pimp your grind.
---
Dude that's too fucking deep (and correct)  for reddit. Kudos to you my friend have an up vote!
---
Spy warnings do not provide their location, it provides your location.
---
What happened to #NoChanges?
---
Nope, and its really lame to report someone for that shit. Turn on profanity filter if it really bothers you
---
Rogue has the most amount of RP, imo. You learn lockpicking, poisons, pick pocketing, and you get to sneak around. Not only is it a fun class to play, but it‚Äôs the easiest class to make your own adventure with. Want to be the bane of the enemy faction in a zone, or rather slip through the cracks and observe from afar? Either way, I feel like rogue really opens up the possibilities of RP.
---
&gt; mere IKEA office
---
Excuse me? IKEA Markus masterrace.
---
&gt;What if OP was being a cunt and needing on things that they didn't need and the party kicked him for that? We only have one side of the story.
---
He was kicked even before he rolled need. Looks like the party leader just wanted to con the party.
---
What goblin subs?
---
Why? Maybe leader just wanted to make sure OP honored the agreement?
---
What server??
---
Gnomish Battle Chicken and Gnomish Death Ray are the only two that aren't bind on equip. Oh and the little smokey pet if you're into that. The rest you can make on your own before you unlearn or just buy later. So 240 Engineering is all you need before retraining it for goblin.
---
I think you need a pet stop attack macro for it to work like you want it to.
---
Spell Batching also complicates things in ways I'm not knowledgeable enough to talk about
---
Lowest lvl that is worth honor to lvl 60 players trying to rank up
---
TIL!
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [nostance:1] Hemorrhage; Cheap Shot
---
100% agree here. 
---
1.) this addon only provides information. You don't know where they stealthed, you don't get an arrow that points saying "OVER THERE 40 YARDS START AOE-ING PUSH THIS BUTTON AND YOU WILL AUTO RUN TO THEIR LOCATION BEING TRACKED!"
---
2.) You still have to find and fight. 
---
3.) The add-on can guestimate the player level based on the spell cast. This can lead to some...interesting encounters as mages like to use lower ranks so you think you're about to fight someone on level and you just end up running to your death.
---
4.) tons of add-ons do the same thing Spy does. It existed in Vanilla as mentioned by OP. 
---
It's just information provided to you, same as Recount, Same as DBM. People claiming this is a broken add-on and you're able to be picked out 50 yards away by someone 30 levels lower than you are incorrect. You cannot target them unless you can physically see them.
---
Maybe this will be a thing in Phase 2? On my server all the level 60 Alliance are running dungeons and raids, while straight up raid groups of 6-10 horde are killing quest givers in the 50+ zones.
---
It won't be the same with the faction imbalances we have.
---
Adding a macro to tell your pet to passive and follow allows for a second click frost trap. 
---
I know it‚Äôs not INSTANT. But it‚Äôs close.
---
60s in greens are the juiciest of targets. Im at 43, gonna do my 43-48 during phase two while PvPing to get a rank or two.
---
Good point on the imaginary aspect. Blizz needs to publish server ratios. With my idea they would also show estimated que times and explain what is going on. If they had implemented this from day one it would not have been an issue, but you are right in that they have set expectation for no queue to set balance.  They actually might need to pay people $$$ to transfer for the first week or two.
---
as a rogue - sweet.
---
Oily fish bois for free action potions, pretty much any mat used in engineering, both leveling engineering and crafting grenades/trinkets/etc.
---
Do you even know lootmaster?
---
I'm sorry I leveled faster than people with families or careers or other lame things. Please forgive me for not ppaying the game around their schedule.
---
&gt; Adding a macro to tell your pet to passive and follow allows for a second click frost trap.
---
Any opponent who isn't brain dead is going to do damage to you or the pet and put you back into combat.
---
It's still broken.
---
Seems death comes at you even faster.
---
Can confirm. Am lvl 41 with this as my new MH dagger. Backstabs are nuts.
---
Banks are character specific.
---
A lot of folks create a separate character that they deem their "Bank" character and park or in a city. Especially helpful when you're leveling. You can just mail stuff you want to save / put on the AH to your bank character, freeing up bag space and not have to run all the way to a city to post items that are probably only worth a handful of silver - but still that silver adds up quick, especially when starting out and trying to amass 100g to buy your level 40 mount.
---
Ok
---
Epl good for horde. Fuck wpl, got camped so hard last night as I was 5k xp from 60 ha.
---
Correct, you can mail to your other characters that are on the same faction on the same server.  It takes one hour for the mail to arrive, whether you are sending items or just money.
---
You sir just got a money printing machine. I hoped you dropped one of your current professions to learn alchemy. If you sold that recipe...
---
No enemy cast bar would make adds on Sulfuran more difficult to interrupt. DBM is quite nice for some fights, such as damage shields on domo and shaz counter spells.
---
It's not the action happens. All it is doing is allowing more windows to accept an action. A himam is still performing the action. As a programmer i can tell you,  it's not automation.
---
 /sigh so we've gone from "i don't see this" to "I don't think they're complaining enough"
---
Mash buttons harder.
---
You're right its broken. Anyone who says it isn't has never solo run anything with a rogue. I had been pick pocket running BRD and sometimes had a 50% chance for it to not drop combat probably because of spell batching. Eventually just had to give up. I dont think it will be fixed and although sometimes happens in the world is much more common in dungeons when there isn't another player to aggro from the vanish
---
I just hope they release AB in the first batch as well. It is my favorite one even considering every bg added since then.
---
And I think they will do the same as with DM, release BGs before the rest of P3.
---
So you're just here to troll, got it.
---
If I had a larger screen, I'd have a separste combat log so that I can easily see what's happening at a glance. But since I don't, Spy can do it for me.
---
Not feral. For feral you want to pounce and powershift shred. Watch your Mana bar and be sure your gear is still hybrid because you'll need the extra int and Stam.
---
It's going to totally destroy arathi basin flag capping/protection for rogues/druids
---
Okay hunter-lady, I love you bye-bye!
---
I rolled orc and currently regret not rolling undead because I feel like I‚Äôm always getting feared, and I don‚Äôt like factoring in the randomness of the stun resist in pvp.
---
That said, once you get your pvp trinket as an orc rogue, you‚Äôll have a way out of fear anyways, and the stun resist despite its randomness, is really helpful when you‚Äôre fighting other rogues. A resisted kidney shot is usually enough to make them screw up and then the tide.
---
Perception seems meh. Not very useful in the open world or bgs unless you know a rogue is nearby. The sword expertise is great for pve, but human is the worst race for pvp alliance side imo. 
---
Overall I‚Äôd say go orc if you can handle being incredibly ugly!
---
48s are green to level 60s. :)
---
Well maybe if they only appear in the log when you enter combat with them ?
---
13g for a green axe top kek
---
If we can confirm this, it seems not even the internet is aware of this! I'd love to finish the quests tonight, but I have limited play time and so muchn other shit to do.
---
Because bg's aren't out yet lol.
---
We can't discuss it because no one gives a shit that you quit.  Bye.
---
You kind of suck at reading.
---
lol jesus christ this fucking subreddit.
---
Just hit 60 this morning. Was 57 on Friday. My recommendation is do NOT do dungeons. It‚Äôs never as efficient as questing, and I say this as a warrior. What with waiting for people and potentially bad players xp/hr sucks. I did WS and EPL (as horde) and it was twice as good as some BRD farming runs I tried at 58
---
Nope 48
---
What a cunt, you shouldn't have censored his name honestly this is a dick thing to do and his actions 100% should have repercussions for him in game as is the classic experience.  
---
I don't get why people think because you kick someone in the group you don't get a chance at all. If the loot roll happens with you there, guess what. That shit is for you too.
---
Even if he kicked you, waited for you to be teleported out, and then rolled on it only to lose, it will still not let him loot it and he would have lost the item to someone who can't even pick it up.
---
They did it because the rest of us didn't want their fan base ruining the other servers. For eastern PvP there were originally only 3 servers so there wasn't exactly room for a second streamer server. There was faerlina which went to the streamers, thalnos which went to the Brazilians, and Herod which was the non-streamer english-speaking server.
---
No, we've gone from you presenting me 4 links, to me still not being able to find enough examples to warrant a whining thread. That's all.
---
No I'm not trying to find something wrong with advice I think you completely have not read anything in the post. 
---
He asked me how me marking a target would be worse than letting them target the tanks target who happens to be one you should have killed first aka a healer or booster. And I explained how it was explained to me if you could go back and read everything that was posted you would be less confused
---
Would this be an easy way to powerlevel a priest?
---
Allianceü§ùHorde
---
Knowing Epstein didn't kill himself
---
Eh, while yes I pretty much agree, I would argue hunters are literally unplayable without at least a hunters mark/start pet attack/cast shoot macro.
---
It's absolutely required and anyone who argues is an idiot. Manually casting hunters mark, telling your pet to attack a target, and then starting your auto attack all separately for every single mob will burn you out quick. It's terrible
---
I just cannot invest enough time to even remotely keep up with the community in this game :(
---
Any opponent who isn‚Äôt brain dead isn‚Äôt going to move on till they know a hunter is truly dead anyway.
---
it was the most sound option as a classic goblin though, he liquidated an asset that will only increase in value by X% and replaced it completely with items that will increase by X+Y%. that's called value town and you know who the mayor of value town is? classic goblins.
---
It really feels like the no lifers are the majority in classic.
---
I just dinged 40. 
---
I'm fucked
---
Since this sub is the place to go for a look at the inner workings of Blizzard customer service...
---
casts are a thing, but they are detected even if they don't use any spell
---
In a way yes, but a good warlock does a lot more than just spam shadowbolt.
---
And when I comb through all those threads for yet more links you'll simply move the goalposts again.
---
Bitch-hunting\*
---
This happened to me before.
---
I was in the Wetlands on my hunter, doing a group quest with others.
---
An absolute BEAST of a crossbow drops.
---
The group leader kicked me as he was a hunter as well, but I won the roll and rubbed it in to him :)
---
I would have to do a couple practice runs because if I died on a pull I would be so embarrassed.
---
Look, I don't want to shit on OP, this is just an example:
---
It could've been that OP was an absolute asshole prior to what's screenshotted and was just insulting everybody and their mothers. A picture tells more than a thousand words, but it's far from being enough to judge somerone.
---
If you really wanna compete with dps once people are better geared its def a big difference but u'll be basically be popping them 24/7 during fights. But this early in game you can def do decent dps and get high in the charts without it or just bringing a few. Personally for bear form tho is where it really shines and you only need to pop maybe 1 charge a boss fight, if ur having trouble with threat...just try pulling threat off a bear tank using a charge spamming maul
---
And this is why my Tauren Druid rides a wolf
---
Be the group leader. It is your only choice.
---
Wait until you're in AB trying to ninja cap against a solo player and 2 more rotate back before you've even opened.
---
Wow, so enticing.
---
That‚Äôs ridiculous.  You can keep combat log data for allies, remove it for enemy players.  You don‚Äôt think they have the tech to do that?
---
I love spy.. but I would be happy if it was broken as well.  Every since I got it, I have gotten complacent.
---
They should be able to restore, but it's more than likely going to take a while (days, not hours).
---
the evidence pointing to "proven guilty" is, like I said, **pretty solid**.  So yeah, not a witch hunt.
---
Also btw "Innocent until proven guilty" and "Due Process" are terms that apply to a court of law, not a gaming subreddit putting an dumb dickwad on blast.  I think you're getting too caught up in your own argument here :D
---
How do you figure out what's a good thermal and what's a bad thermal? Are there any decent guide articles out there?
---
You must be terrible if you can't accept the reality that a 3rd party program is controlling all slave characters.
---
What part don't you understand? The human isn't controlling them, by definition. A program is doing that. The SAME program that automates characters without a human at the keyboard. Because it's literally the same thing except turned onto 'real time mode.'
---
Dont touch that, it's hot. Ouch why did you let me touch that?
---
I‚Äôve done that before in the badlands. It was really funny. He eventually found a friendly ally and they got me. But I spent a good 20 minutes chasing, charging, everything I could.
---
Cast bars are pretty crucial though, otherwise you're massively limiting the ability of any class that has an interrupt to handle a casting class, and inherently giving a major buff to the classes that do not have an interrupt: paladin, hunter, priest, etc
---
blizz made it so server pop in realm list doesn't reflect in real-time any more, but rather the peak over the week. 
---
[blue post](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-list-populations-updated-28-october/98659)

I mean, if all of our 5 people P2W 5 accounts it would take 25 people to kill our 5.
---
&gt;Well if you really want the experience intended by the devs
---
I couldn't care any less about this. I care about a good game.
---
well seeing as theres currently like 1-2 horde guilds flasking atm and 1 maybe 2 alli guilds....theres plenty of lotus to go around. lol
---
which dept do you work in at blizzard
---
Don't forget the "my quiver is now my gun" post.
---
I saw pawn updated recently. Any reason you don't want to use that one? I've never used it so I don't know anything about it.
---
I get that reference!
---
You just have to mark it differently and fill it out.
---
Everyone need on boe, even if you can't equip it or if it's an upgrade. It's sellable on AH.  I've had 2 boe ninjas happen in my pugs by level 30. No more.
---
When you use the lazy "u can't red lol" argument then yeah, I'm gonna actually point out why not only spamming "unpopular opinion" BS is dumb, but the actual content of your post is dumb too. 
---
Just make a more cohesive argument next time and people won't be able to lecture you on how different people take on different tasks independently.
---
As for spy: we asked for vanilla and got it - and people are better at writing addons these days. I actually don't blame Blizzard on this: they are crippled by the insane nochanges crowd who are now becoming hypocritical
---
NONE CHANGINGERS
---
Us people with good gear need easy targets too man
---
Yes please stop making memes reminding people that the world's most prolific pedophile implicating some of the most powerful and famous people in the world supposedly died under extremely suspicious circumstances just before he was to reveal his accomplices
---
It doesn‚Äôt even sell at 5-10g atm
---
I'm feeling pretty similarly. At 53 right now. Seems like I'm just behind the curve and I've been busting ass playing this game already.
---
That's why I roll horde. No greedy humans.
---
Why do you care about that, the only thing that matters is loot and you got it. If someone tells me to die on an online video game then I don't care. I've been told that stuff since 2004 when I started playing online games, it's literally just words by anonymous people you don't know, means nothing.
---
someone in the other thread suggested excluded enemy faction from combat log unless they interact with you.
---
They are about equal, but herbs rarely sell here anyway, only 5 or 6 raiding guilds on alliance and most farm their own it seems. 
---
The most frustrating thing about Arcanite Reaper is the economy.
---
How to miss the point
---
Our enhancement shaman is in the tank group, puts down a totem and that is about it. He throw occasional heals but stays alive as his priority.
---
Yeah keep believing your shit üòÇ
---
Soon you‚Äôll be able to enjoy that walk in grey.
---
Blizzard doesn't like admitting they're wrong.  Well, I mean, no company does I guess.  But they love to put on a show of being player-first, so it's especially off-putting.
---
I would keep fighting this by opening tickets. Sorry you had such a bad experience, no one blames you for quitting. If you can, try to find a nicer guild :-)
---
This does not match my first-hand experience. I actually keep a lower ranked PW:F on my bars for when I'm running through lower level areas so I can rain buffs on them. Is there perhaps a built-in setting you may have set and forgotten about?
---
The in game community is no different than real life. Theres a lot of aholes out there. Tryhards that will screw everyone and everything over to get what they want. Also ita a game, remember you may at times be dealing with children and teens.... or adults that act like children.
---
It depends on where you live though. I moved out of a big city, back to my small hometown. People are not as stressed or rushed here and generally more considerate. Same applies to the guild and people you choose in game. Control your environment by finding the right guild for you. If guildies are being aholes to you or others and you dont like it, find a new guild.
---
I'm getting semi worried myself about a big guild I joined. 3+ raid teams, new members joining hourly. It's hard to connect and learn about everyone.  And there is no way everyone who joins is being screened well enough to conform with the guilds rules and ideals. I had to ignore one guildy already, but if I find myself ignoring a half dozen or so, that's when I'll probably start to look elsewhere.
---
I have video of FD going onto cool down but the buff was never allowed, no animation played, and the mods didn't give af. I was standing still when I hit it.
---
I could see the two are actually really good friends.  It's boe so no real harm.  As a joke, one kicks the other friend knowing, maybe not knowing, how it works.  Gets a laugh.  One person realizes this screenshot could get karma on Reddit.
---
I know my friends and i kick each other all the time since we know there are no consequences other than some minor inconvenience.
---
You most certainly haven't finished all zone quests mate. You must have skipped over a ton of grindy quests, but those are the ones that give you levels.
---
I mean, just check out pretty much all leveling routes if you don't believe me. They get you from 1-60 without ever grinding (w/o accompanying quests), getting stuck or doing dungeons.
---
I really enjoy the forge/anvil being right next to the ah
---
Don't know 'bout you bro, but I'm a Dancer.
---
If only 3 people rolled... You basically tried to ninja off the rls mistake. I don't think you're the good guy in this story.
---
If its overpopulated, then people are sitting in queues. Why would that affect how often it seems to be crashing? Unless people in queue are somehow causing these crashes. In which case, lol
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
Listen it's just a Corsair thing, you wouldn't understand
---
then dont do the instance haha
---
üòÇ PvE server.
---
You mean 25 to beat your 25 right?
---
I'm fairly sure that those who did not reach 60 by now, won't rush to 60 now, so no need to worry about that!
---
They killed totem stomp macros.  This is worse than that.
---
Can't advocate. Too busy rushing my 10th lvl 60.
---
I use threat plates. It will display the debuff on the peasants name plate, making it much much easier to know who needs dispelling
---
If they announced that the raid had the head reserves and you joined, the gms are more likely to uphold that social contract then the roll.
---
Never claimed to be the good guy. I know I‚Äôm not the bad actor here. 
---
It was me, the rl tank and three other non guildies that rolled on it.
---
Well played buddy
---
He coule have been an asshole but he wasn't kicked from group until after the item dropped, an item the party leader then expected to be the only one rolling need on.
---
There could be more here but nothing in the photo implies more.
---
Can almost guarantee the group was advertised as head reserved.. Rolling on an item that was reserved  then getting upset when kicked... But Apperently it's OK because he used the In game roll mechanic so he should be in the clear.
---
You can get cheap int/spi gear on AH that will allow you easily heal dungeons like BRD. And since Palas dont need to waste 100g for a mount, it wont break your bank. Plus, Palas are efficient healers so its not that bad.
---
I play a priest, I have a full set of green gear that has +nature damage.  I carry around a Volcanic Hammer with Icy Weapon enchant on it, and green off hand of frozen wrath.
---
I‚Äôve been power leveling every day to get to level 50 before phase 2 so I can hide in instances the rest of the way. Was 31 a week ago. Am 49.
---
It feels like Indianna Jones running from the boulder.
---
Okay, so the servers dropped dead somewhere during the last week, from being high pop? Gotcha.
---
Bullshit you would. As if you are constantky watching your log in your capital city. Bull. Shit.
---
If they said head was reserved before the raid started and you tried to roll on it anyway just because of a mistake by the master looter than imo you're the toxic and selfish player and I'm glad you didnt get the head. Other people's mistakes should not be to your benefit. If I drop 5 bucks out of my pocket and you pick it up and take it then you're the asshole.
---
That's disgusting. I can't believe that people do this... to get personal gain in a virtual video-game. Absolutely revolting... how pathetic.
---
I don't think the Reddit community reflects the overall Classic playerbase at all.  People who take the time to browse here, and answer a survey, go a lot harder than the typical player.
---
You can enter a dungeon 5 times an hour. If you are under an hour when resetting for the 5th time and you are offline, you get sent to your hearth stone location.
---
I find a lot of quests like this where mbos share a spawn chance so people will pick off only the mobs they need and slowly skew the population towards the other mobs in the spawn pool. 
---
Some leveling guides like zygors and of course comments on wowhead will warn you about this and instruct you to kill all the mobs to help get more needed ones to spawn.
---
What happened to the whole no changes thing.  Community along with GMs was a real vanilla experience.  The report system is not even a shell of what it used to be.
---
luckily in my guild we do dkp and are rewarded for things like being on time and downing bosses rather than the optimality of our dps.
---
It works better and farther than hunter tracking.  Having that add on as a hunter is fucking fantastic lol.  I can tell who is what class, and see location on the mini map now.  
---
If I hear a stealthy?  Switch tracking and hunt them down.
---
I think he's saying you have to wait the 20 seconds to logout, you can't "exit game" or "ALT+F4" out of WoW or it will hearth you.
---
He did, the guy is PushmyBush
---
Doesn't even parse chat very well anymore.
---
Got me!
---
I'd play the game on fully max settings at 60 FPS on a PC I bought myself when I was 13. It was nowhere near high end. WoW wasn't a demanding game even on its release. This trope about how everyone played on their family shared Pentium 3 with 10 FPS is not representative.
---
Well, your options are a server full of cowards and a server that is more dead than Jeffrey Epstein.  If either of those sound appealing to you go for it.
---
The population isn‚Äôt comparable to Faerlina or Herod, I‚Äôve never had a queue, but I‚Äôve also never had an issue finding a group for anything and there are people everywhere it seems. It feels like it does when I played the game back in the day, capital cities are always bustling and the enemy faction is always nearby out in the open world. Far from a dead server, despite all the memes. Faction balance wise it feels pretty even to me. Horde does have a healthy RP community and events from what I can tell on the discord and subreddit.
---
Isn‚Äôt that just a lvl 18 dagger?
---
Conjured food tastes best with salt
---
Sounds like they both got what they deserved, /u/poowatereater saw the loot not being put on ML as an opportunity to snipe a reserved item instead of passing on it üò¥
---
Pushmybush is a scoundrel! 
---
Take me to the top boys!
---
Well that's just Blizzard entire CS now, they employed like +5000 support staff just for WoW back in the mid 2000s, now it's gotta be under 200.
---
prime pickin for honor farm Clap
---
Maybe it‚Äôs outdated? For some addons to work you must tick the ‚ÄûLoad outdated addons‚Äú I believe it is. I think it‚Äôs on the upper right corner.
---
Yes &amp; a Hunter
---
&gt;How are you making it worse? If your groups damage is low and **you need focus targets**...
---
Agreed. The addon is garbage.
---
Yes indeed we were short bus casual guild..
---
It's way better than hunter tracking.  Easy targeting, larger range, class information...
---
lol what a piece of shit that guy is. I hope he gets blacklisted and harassed by everyone on that server.
---
Frostbite procced towards the end
---
Arcanite Reaper has very low pop. Heartseeker is already worse than Skeram in the opposite direction. Like 9:1 alliance advantage.
---
Same on US. I've had quite a few bad moonfire incidents as well. Just the other day with timbermaw rep. 2 man team and the druid would steal mobs I already had 3 dots on or was sending my pet after. I asked to join their group since they clearly only had two people and rep doesn't change with more. Guy just said "we're not interested in more people.". Then continued to snipe as many mobs as possible from under me.
---
The obbession with fresh destroyed a ton of private servers
---
Amazing, thanks dude!
---
To prevent AH shopping which would be clearly abused, you could have any of these options: restrict to lvl 60s, charge fee, have a time wait period, frequency limit, playtime delay, etc. I am just trying to remove the fear barrier that this is a one way transfer, which I think is the primary reason folks don‚Äôt take the transfer leap of faith, which it is. There must be way to remove that fear.
---
Is this someone‚Äôs fireplace mantel or based on some early concept art or something?
---
Can you expand on the powershift bug? I recently went hotw for PvP anyway, but just curious
---
Open a new server for just that and I would be in!
---
Everyone uses GFPPs at raggi. If people refuse to do so, the mana pot bill of the healers explode. Piggybagging off your other people's effort isnt taken kindly. 
---
If you refuse to adapt and actually carry your weight, you get cut. Easy as that.
---
You caught them! Now they HAVE to change it. 
---
Good luck to you - hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for.
---
FD hasn't even been the worst for me. I specced back out of improved FD so I can understand getting resisted (mostly by King G, who is level 62). 
---
However it's very annoying when I get killed by spell batching -- I hit invis pot to break FD, and a nearby demon casts cripple on me in the same tick, breaking the invis. Happened 5 times in a row one evening.
---
I've adjusted by getting riskier with my FD location on that skip, leaving less (no) wiggle room with regard to having enough invis time to get past the mobs.
---
Obviously this is a very first-world problem.
---
Could be that witches are just really good at not arousing enough suspicion for a hunt on them anymore
---
This sub is better at memeing than i thought
---
Mass of McGowan is another really solid 'budget' mainhand. I picked it up for like 7g on Fairbanks
---
Pass.
---
Would you guys please clarify what this is supposed to mean? I literally hit 48 the other day and want to know what's up in phase 2 as I am just a casual.
---
&gt; But if you think those servers are "dead" then there is no helping you. If its so important that the server is full with people at extreme hours, stay at the mega-servers.
---
yeah you gotta kick em right before the boss dies correct? bad ninja is bad
---
That's my concern with the Orc's stun resist. It definitely has a greater range of use but is still random where as WoTF is on command when needed, leaving the trinket open for a 2nd form of CC break.
---
The human perception I'm curious about just for BG's...sneaking into the flag room to find hiding rogues/druids or up to a cap point in AB. And this really only comes into play with question #1 on my list.
---
I had a high end pc and still played on min settings with max view distance for pvp.  My computer would still seize up in IF and Org.
---
You know his name is still visible right? As someone else rolling need. ‚ÄúPushmybuttons‚Äù
---
What do you use?
---
Ah, that‚Äôs what I originally thought, but Sodapoppin was saying it was lowbies too the other week.
---
People flock to AB in the masses. I think it's a good idea to spread out the BGs.
---
Yeah I just ran BRD 58-60 xp was good and gave me a a bunch of my pre-bis Before I hit 60.
---
I personally liked it that way.
---
Sorry you are running with bad bears or healers. Druids are equal to or better then warriors in the current phase.
---
Named and shamed
---
r/instantkarma
---
Imagine reporting someone for ‚Äúcursing‚Äù
---
Cool, you don't play with addons. You can enjoy the game how you want, but we are discussing addons.
---
And yet they actually put in more effort than was necessary for legitimately responding to the ticket, the illegitimate response I got back took more effort than "We can't help with any of that." Far more keystrokes hit.
---
1. People use DKP or loot council, virtually no one rolls for loot outside of pugs.
---
2. Raid BiS
---
3. Realistic, probably can't buy it. 
---
4. Yes
---
5. Your gear is fine. Spec leniency will depend on how serious your guild is. 
---
6. Also lookup raid BiS
---
Not sure how people (cough horde cough) can't understand this. Simple logic too difficult for them I suppose.
---
It would be almost as if they could see you mounted and riding towards a flag way before you got there..
---
You might want to speak to you guild leadership because you seem to literally know nothing about what is going on, we literally are planning World Boss shit as we speak between the two guilds...
---
my hands are cold
---
Its more cpu intensive.  (Source : my pc) the first thing I upgraded was the GPU, I had a i7 2600 (non k) with a gtx 770 4gb, my fps barely and I mean barely went up (atleast at 1080p was only 5% increase, but when I got a new mobo ram and a i7 8700k it nearly doubled.  All I'm saying is a gtx 1050ti is more than enough at 1080p max settings.  Gotta get atleast a nes i5 (6 core) or ryzen 5 not the 1600 but 2600 or 3600.
---
Does Shred even work well enough in PvP to be considered viable? I mean, is this used strictly for getting the jump with Pounce and quickly dropping one or two Shreds before the stun wears off only? Or can you actually effectively Shred behind targets that often?
---
Where does it say it‚Äôll be $450 by Black Friday? I don‚Äôt see that anywhere.
---
Honestly, the alliance that already transferred off Skeram fucked you. They pussied out when there was barely a 60/40 split. There's not much blizzard can do outside of adding faction queues.
---
On the bright side, I hear the alliance guys that are sticking it out are going to plan some big pvp stuff to stick it to the horde. Maybe try and find people like that to group up with.
---
Hey man there's nothing wrong with a male orc wanting to look like a pretty princess sometimes.
---
Tweaking the code does not change its backbone. The core of it is the same, the meat and potatoes is still 15 years old
---
&gt; Everybody is able of doing horrible thing if the right conditions and circumstances are met.
---
You can train yourself and others to mitigate the risks of people becoming horrible people.
---
It‚Äôs such bulkshit we can‚Äôt use the free server transfer to go to a PVE server from PVP. I‚Äôm stuck in the same boat as y‚Äôall. I don‚Äôt have time for corpse walks and I hate these level 60 micropeen players who will gank you simply for being there.
---
thankfully my game time expires soon. but even though, making gold schemes is more interesting to me.
---
We found pushmybush!

 **&lt;The¬†Tail** **End&gt; | North America | Alliance | Pagle (PvE) | Semi-core Raiding**

At The Tail End, we raid at the tail end of the week.  
---
**Class Needs:** We need 3 more DPS to round out our core raid team. Prefer Fury Warriors.  
---
**Guild Culture:** We are a friendly bunch, camaraderie is more important than loot. Joking and joviality is encouraged, including NSFW humor. But toxicity is not tolerated. No culture war stuff either.

---
Neither are confirmed to actually happen though
---
&gt; Just didn't like it. It's way less organic than world pvp or even battlegrounds.
---
And has a linear progression that reflects your skill level unlike the others.
---
Its actually insane that you and the rest of the people are defending an addon that literally plays the game for you. Its like that questie addon that does all the quests for you. We get it: you're too braindead to have awareness.
---
"I" should have been capitalized in that sentence.  You must be very stupid to make that mistake.
---
Actually you are good bait if you have friends that are level 60 rogues
---
Phase 2 I'll be running soul link, but [nightflag](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0bVRbZZxx0tMbtp) in premades.

user name confirmed
---
Should hit 59 tonight. The ganking on Herod has increased significantly in the last week. 
---
WTF is it with gnomes? 9x out of 10 the lvl 60 ganking me is a gnome..
---
That captain pierecs daughter
---
Do you have any more information on ‚Äúno layering‚Äù? When is that supposed to happen and what exactly does that entail?
---
Gnomer boy rockin' up STV
---
Have to be kicked before the kill for it to ‚Äòwork;‚Äô I hope he felt stupid.
---
&gt;Based on...your ass.
---
Hey dumbfuck, it's based on how the functionality of the LUA pulls the API. The code for all of these LUA calls are known and documented, so shut the fuck up and go be wrong somewhere else.
---
I leveled super fast as protection once I got 51 and spent my life in BRD from 51-57 the BRS after that
---
Probably. Stranglethorn is going to be brutal. Unless you can power level by Thursday and wrap up STV.
---
Horde had no reason to transfer though. Why would they?
---
i think you underestimate the petty dedication of some people
---
Actually based on BfA client. Only the blizzcon demo was legion client based.
---
Send it to his GM ‚Äúthought you ought to know you got a ninja in your ranks‚Äù
---
Lol yeah too bad the big baby brigade is downvoting me. This is just a game, but real people think this way in real life and I just hope this guy never works in the legal system.
---
I finished these quests and dont have repair...
---
I can check when I get home.
---
No ones complaining about leveling faster but when those who leveled fast start pushing the content to come out faster etc it creates a problem.
---
I wish Bliz would actually come out with themed servers in that sense like the hardcore people flock to a particular server that has an accelerated schedule or something
---
Right? I was so pumped! I'm still smiling.
---
I feel that, only started up last week but balancing work and life I can only play for like an hour, maybe 2 a day. Sometimes I can't even play. I love the game though so i'm just gone have to tough it out.
---
If you‚Äôre Horde maybe...
---
Definitely not as Alliance.
---
Happens to me in storm wind if I‚Äôm not in the trade district. I remember someone telling me there‚Äôs a finite amount of ‚Äúcharges‚Äù is casts and once it hits that limit no more people get it. It allegedly starts from the closes targets from the head and pans outward but I don‚Äôt think this is true, just what someone told me
---
On a PvE server, what are the options for grinding honor once phase 2 hits? There are no battlegrounds, right? And world PvP isn‚Äôt a thing unless people flag up?
---
He can convince his guild to transfer with him. And if they're one of the top guilds on the server they could convince other guilds to follow suit.

---
---- About ----
---
FoF is a laid-back guild with a focus on end-game raiding on a more relaxed, casual schedule giving our members a way to experience all the content Classic has to offer while still maintaining their RL responsibilities.
---
As our core members and the backbone of our future raiding team finish their leveling and begin to farm their pre-bis, we are looking to fill in the gaps of our roster. We plan to step into raids within the next couple of weeks.
---
We are looking for players that are level 50+ that are wanting a more relaxed, casual, and personal guild that, while not on the cutting edge, has the experience, drive, and effort to clear all the content Classic has to offer.
---
---- Recruiting ----
---
Our class needs are as follows (we prefer new members be level 50+, but are willing to be flexible)
---
Tanks:
---
Warrior: Low
---
Druid: Closed
---
DPS:
---
Warlock: Low
---
Mage: High
---
Rogue: Low
---
Hunter: High
---
Warrior: Medium
---
Shaman: Closed
---
Priest: Closed
---
Heals:
---
Shaman: Low
---
Priest: Medium
---
Druid: Medium
---
---- Expectations ----
---
You don‚Äôt need to have prior raiding experience, just be on time, prepared, and know your class. We can help with the rest.
---
---- Contact ----
---
For more info you can message me through discord (Pwlocke #7260) or look in-game for: Bahnzo, Gallar, Resented, FreshPrintz, Chuhee, or Zab
---
&gt; It's either #nochanges or #allthechanges     
---
I fundamentally disagree with that, minor QOL changes can be added without creating the retail experience.
---
1) theres a lootmaster and he gives items to the people. Every raid is different some use dkp, others lootcouncil and randoms use rolls.
---
You can roll with chatcommand "/random"
---
The highest roll wins the item normally.
---
2) see wowhead bis mage classic
---
https://de.classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
3) you cant buy it - just roll high enought
---
4) best way is to join a raid guild but you can also just read the chat. There are always people who search
---
5) for mc and ony you dont need any specific gear
---
So also with 58 you can raid
---
6) ony is easier. You get t2 head there
---
The comment you originally replied to didn't say that we had all of the information, it was saying that from the picture, it doesn't seem like there could be any additional context that changes the situation here. Since your hypothetical situation doesn't make any sense in this given situation, it seems like you'd agree, because you couldn't even make up some 'context' that makes the party lead not an asshole.
---
Only it isnt
---
Did you even watch the movies. 
---
[He didn‚Äôt even say this...](https://youtu.be/3xYXUeSmb-Y)
---
Yeah and the discussion of the add on included what the game is like without them.
---
You‚Äôre probably soo far gone from the original game you can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs like without add ons... seeing how you‚Äôre butt hurt that I can enjoy them without :P
---
Because that's boring as shit?
---
Undead is the best with WotF you won't regret it
---
Onyxia is not as hard as molten core. It's short (one boss) and resets every 5 days. It gives you your T2 helm (better than the T1 helm from MC).
---
You would want to at least keep ice block for Onyxia in case of aggro. Just watch a couple of videos and you should get the idea.
---
For all raids it's better to join a raiding guild that has an established loot system. Even if it is free roll, raiding with the same group of people every week will boost your chances of getting the loot. A good guild also balances the number of classes in the raid, so you are not competing with too many people. In one of the pugs, I've seen over 10 mages competing for gear.
---
There are top guilds selling gold raid runs - basically you run with them and if the gear you want drops, you pay gold and you are guaranteed the loot. Last time I've seen this, the guild at our server is asking for 750g for the T2 mage helm from Onyxia.
---
The respawn rate is def the same as the old 1hr. I time them perfectly with a buddy and we run opposite loops in WS and Steppes. They only thing I believe has changed is the background cool down. Like if it hasn‚Äôt been picked in a while and has sat the for over ex-2 hours. It has a faster respawn. The quickest I‚Äôve seen is 30 min and the longest I‚Äôve seen is 1hr 40min. I have 19 lotus in my bags and holy fuck at the dreamfoil, sage, and cap. I‚Äôm missing 1 spawn in both steppes and WS. They go for about 40-50G in my server. Ellogov if you‚Äôre reading this, I‚Äôll be seeing you ;).
---
Is the backbone 15 years old or the meat and potatoes 15 years old?
---
You're not wrong that it's the game code limiting the server stability (though I'm sure hardware has a breaking point that it's getting close to), but it's not because they have barely changed it in 15 years.  
---
Without seeing the code firsthand it's impossible to tell what changes have occured, but I can guarantee you that the codebase from 2006 looks very, very different from the code base now.
---
Why all the pettiness from the party leader, is this a twink dagger?
---
Yes I have done both quests and can repair at LHC.
---
Being completely honest, I bought a Razer mouse for the first time and it was disfunctional right out of the box.  Thought I could be lucky and the negative reviews were just angry customers, nope, their quality control has gone way down.  I would never recommend a Razer mouse to anyone,  it's Logitech all day IMO, Corsair is ok but have similar Quality control issue to Razer in my experience, at least with their peripherals after owning both a headset and keyboard from them.
---
Damn you are destroying this man.
---
Not right now, but paid transfers are an inevitability. There's a blue post somewhere that says "paid transfers will be the first paid feature to be implemented in classic".
---
It's going to crash the economy of items like this on the super high pop servers because there will be hundreds of players with this idea.
---
1. Not true. Many guilds select who can roll for items.
---
Its still strong in groups. On big pulls i use AP flamestrike, instant flamestrike, cone of cold, arcane explosion. Huuuge dps, just got to kite the mobs a little bit.
---
Yeah, the corner is where I do it now. Had been going about a third up the ramp.
---
Speed to boots is a good idea.
---
What‚Äôs more likely: 
---
1) A pug raid that tries to ninja the Onyxia head, thereby ruining their server reputation
---
2) You didn‚Äôt pay attention to the raids loot rules and were opportunistic when the raid leader made the loot rule mistake
---
Don‚Äôt bother answering, I don‚Äôt care to hear any more out of you
---
The only people making this argument are those who didnt play pservers.
---
I don't need it, and I prefer other farms to lotus routes. I brought this up because I noticed it was an issue.
---
Horde ofc
---
Can almost 100% guarantee they will not be changing the spawns on these or anything else. If some guild is literally poopsocking it 24/7 watching for the black lotus spawns then you'll just have to do it harder or just forget about it.
---
I think spy is bullshit.
---
I've used it to kill dozens of people.  Especially by targeting names that pop up and hitting mindvision. 
---
Sometimes I just sit around as the scout doing this while the other homies run people down.
---
I would love to get rid of that personally.
---
Create a new indicator of type "bar" and the status tied to it should be "power".
---
They just aren't geared right. I have tanked 2 adds on Domo after one of our war/paladin tanks died as a bear easily. If you don't have a priest healing them for the armor buff that also causes issues. Druid itemization is weird so if you aren't collecting the right gear you aren't an amazing tank.
---
He could be ninja rolling need and that's why he was kicked.  Just saying there could be more info that changes the meaning.
---
But our princess is in another castle!
---
Ingame, like following said individual and tagging/fearing his mobs I assume.             
---
Escalating things irl doesn't sit right with me. But fuck him ingame.
---
But spirit increases spell power with the holy talent, so it is still a very useful (the most useful?) stat for priest healing.
---
Whats the deal with DKP/LC? Is the general vibe to pass loot to players who've been around the longest or are higher ranking or what? Ran with my guild last night and was a bit miffed when my desired loot dropped and they just shadow passed it to the GM with no rolls
---
yeap we had like 20 people /lay or /sleep in front of Org AH, it was definitely the vibe sesh of the night, just kickin the hoots
---
We should ban Track Humanoids and nameplates while we're at it lol. Both of those tell you when someone is nearby too.
---
49 rogue... Can I finish leveling in Azshara?
---
It can target through stealth with a detection buff
---
Literally nothing will happen in Phase 2. 99% of people don't know or don't care.
---
Kind of sad that some think Questie is essential.
---
Who convinced you that it's an amazing twink item? The staves are better. The amount of caster twinks that will farm furbolg rep for the OH is so minuscule that the demand will never be there.
---
Even those guys will probably prefer using a stamina 1hander instead. 4 stamina is better than 4 int and 2 spirit for PvP.
---
Pretty much simple as that
---
It might be useful for detecting a rogue in the flag room, but usually as a rogue you‚Äôd be on D, so you don‚Äôt see the opponents flag room much unless you‚Äôre after the flag carrier trying to re cap, in which case they can‚Äôt be stealthed and aren‚Äôt usually alone.
---
Paladins are my least favourite fight right now. High armour, can‚Äôt be snared reliably, and bubble makes the fight just last forever. They may not be the hardest opponent in terms of win/loss ratio, but definitely one of the most annoying because of how long it takes.
---
Shamans I‚Äôm not sure about, I‚Äôve never personally fought one as I‚Äôm horde and the dueling scene isn‚Äôt big yet on my server.  Ive watched a few duels and one strat I saw was to cheap shot into kidney shot the shaman and kill totems, then blind as ks runs out to get a restealth and open on him without totems. If by some chance he didn‚Äôt go ghost wolf, you can sap him and kill his totems instead, but in ghost wolf they can‚Äôt be sapped.
---
How much XP do people get from a run of armory?
---
&gt;You have no idea what happened and if Pushmybush is innocent because OP had been needing on stuff all dungeon and the leader was trying to stop him from needing on EVERYTHING then that's a different story.
---
Again, then he would have been kicked beforehand. None of the 'hypotheticals' that keep coming up in this thread make any sense when you think about it for more than a second. You can try again, but your above hypothetical makes no sense.
---
&gt;Congrats, you've convicted an innocent man because you don't care about real evidence or the other side of the story. For the good of the country, Never work in legal
---
You know Reddit and the WoW classic community aren't a court of law, right? We're not bound by the rule of innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
---
That said, if there is a threat, it sounds like they take it seriously. A few weeks back, I was in a guild alliance raid where the raid leader ninja'd Garr's bindings. (shortest guild alliance ever)
---
Last week out of the blue that guy's guild leader starts messaging me with weird, menacing shit carefully just shy of overt terroristic threats, like the messages a guy would leave on voicemail right before he murders his ex. Submitted a manual report for harassment. Ultimately the response was that they won't do anything, but the GM who responded said he reviewed the guy's entire chat logs since messaging me. As I'm thinking of it right now, going back a little further probably would have been more thorough, but I'm nevertheless impressed they reviewed that much.
---
More or less correct.
---
It removes luck from assigning loot and generally people who contribute the most to the guild get highest priority.
---
AFAIK it will be added with the upcoming Honor system patch
---
It's not how Vanilla worked. I'm sorry you didn't know about addons in 2005 but a lot of us did and we were already playing with enemy cast bars and spell alerts back then.
---
You not knowing something 15 years ago doesn't mean that now no one should have it just because you personally are no longer ignorant of it.
---
Your comment is so reddit it hurts.
---
I feel this as a shadow priest.
---
Because on the internet you can get away with it more and wont be shamed publically.. so yeah people act much worse
---
All is good , but a well geared dual wield fury is top .
---
Is that meant to mean something? You can use a macro even for sitting down. You come across as trying to look smart but basically telling us the sky is blue.
---
Why do we call every joke a meme these days? Unless that IS the meme.
---
I knew about and used plenty of addons back in the day. No need to be a complete and utter douche. Dial it back, kid.
---
The fact is that there are a lot more complex addons these days that, IMO, run counter to an even, involved, and interesting version of the game. Addons that remove the requirement for you to....fucking look around (do you really find it that hard to...look around?) fit that discription, and IMO, should be removed. If you need help to look around to notice people around you - I'd suggest more time practicing and less time being a dick on the internet.
---
Damn, came here for this LOL
---
You can see buffs cast in the combat log. I don't think addons can reveal existing buffs on evened without using detect magic, but I could be mistaken.
---
I have heard of Druids, but aren't they a myth?
---
Yes use zeal
---
Yeah what lol nah we gonna find him and make him need roll for his life
---
Why would you want to ban DBM?
---
I've been trolled by one of these types before, happy for you that your griefer was a dumbfuck.
---
HOW? Are you fucking trolling or is it possible for a human to be this stupid?
---
OK, all addons related to this are bannable...somehow Blizzard has enforced this impossible and unrealistic vision in your tiny yet thick skull.
---
Someone takes the LUA code and runs it as a WeakAura, what do you do?
---
There is a profanity filter in case your precious eyes can't handle swear words. Blizzard isn't going to ban someone for something you have the option to turn off.
---
&gt; Maybe youve got some latency issues
---
I do not.
---
&gt;Let me ask this: did you play on a private server?
---
Most people who play Classic have, what of it?
---
&gt;Like I said, I notice no change at all from Vanilla.
---
Well then you're not looking at it hard enough because the OP has a video of how it should be and it's not working like that.
---
I get between 25-30g/hr but respec'd to Sub and it's been so much better. I also no longer reset the instance and just pickpocket a loop then will pickpocket my way to the bar to sell everything when my bags are nearly full.
---
Oh I know it‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs a lot better than 80:20 lmao
---
Vanish always worked like this.
---
If you're getting hit by a ton of mobs then vanish will fail. Either there will be an auto attack already in flight that knocks you out of stealth... or a mob detects you from proximity.
---
You need to make some distance with sprint before popping the vanish. I've never had a vanish fail when properly positioned.
---
The greys they drop, and items like greens and whatnot, are on average worth more than the few copper and 1 or 2 cloth a humanoid gives. Plus some beasts drop white AH items (cooking etc). Wool cloth is the exception on my realm atm, sells for a decent amount.
---
That means he's been reported to many times so the automated system took him out. A GM will never look into a report that fast.
---
UD Rogue here, not 60 yet so I can't comment about classic, but in vanilla I played a HU warlock full T2/2.5 and my biggest nemesis on our server was a UD rogue in T3 :)
---
Having used perception a lot on my warlock, it's useful in specific situations - duels, 1v1 worldpvp when you know a rogue is nearby, protecting flag room if you know a rogue is nearby, and arenas. I never played a human rogue, but I remember in BC when that was highly useful in arenas because you can obviously see other rogues first. Very situational, IMO don't pick human for perception, it's the built in trinket in BC that was truly awesome.
---
Now.. on the flip side, being a UD rogue had a massive advantage over a warlock and shadow priests since you can break out of charm or fear. This was the hardest 1vs1 match up I faced as a HU warlock in vanilla, and we always met up with each other in world pvp so.. hence my nemesis.
---
I think you can't go wrong as an orc either, bloodlust and stun resist will come in handy. But as personal preference, WoTF has proven very useful in world pvp, even as a non-60.
---
Shaming other people for learning new languages via immersion, while you can't even tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese text? Okay.
---
Lucky!
---
Tried ninja looting a bop blue? Guess i have to burn your house down.
---
can confirm, am also dead
---
I think a survey with this many people is pretty representative of a community as a whole.  Hell, half the threads here are people complaining that they aren't 60 and its going too fast.  You're also not counting all the other people that have been 60 for 2 months and don't go on reddit either.
---
None of the 'data parsing code' is hidden. You confidently state bullshit that is wrong, you have no clue. You didn't even know the API's and the source code for the WoW UI are freely available information. You keep saying 'hidden' and 'backend'. You're a fucking moron just spouting complete  bullshit. 
---
You're literally the most ass talking person here. You keep making completely made up assertions and then say that others are talking out of their ass because of those wrong assertions. 
---
Also, never once did I say anything was impossible, you're a fucking moron who can't read for shit.
---
Well, I guess this makes you a better informed person than me. Ive seen a few topics on this sub and you are prob aware of an old bluepost referring to the "first patch after launch" as a timeline for key ring. For me it is safe to assume that key ring will be implemented soon and I ve destroyed my key assuming there were no such thing until TBC.
---
Only ninja looters I've met in classic have been priests. Which honestly came as a shock since I've always known priests to be nice people in the past.
---
Dont gaslight me boy.
---
Then I sadly have no idea what that might be. Maybe a different addon overriding it? Might be a conflict between two addons.
---
Gotcha. I didn‚Äôt even consider buying the boe stuff later. 
---
Well this comment is just silly - why have any addon with that logic.  
---
You gonna take out macros next?
---
rip me
---
Personally my first 2 points are remorseless attacks. Then I go down combat. Remorseless Attacks sets the grind pace very well and keeps you in a rhythm. Everyone is different though. Just my personal choice.
---
Level 43 warrior on Rattlegore Alliance - NA 
---
Looking for some folks to dungeon/quest with to expedite that grind to 60. Also possibly down for some mid level honor grinding with a healer.
---
Makes sense, AoE would be a nightmare with it.
---
Go play return to reckoning, that game constantly has 300+ vs 300+ and the servers are fucking fine. It‚Äôs embarrassing that a game run on a private server can handle that combat, but the billionaire company blizzard can‚Äôt handle it.
---
Its a fact that the alliance act as a great filter.
---
Wait how would this even benefit them in Retail?  Doesn't everyone get their own loot off bosses right now?  Or was it less loot related and more trying to stiff you on finishing the entire Dungeon?
---
So after more research, it seems that version 10.5 does not work at all. I downloaded version 10.4 and it works perfectly
---
Dude, you clearly don't know what you are talking about and don't work in network IT or engineering. Just let it go, people have been able to have 400+ people in a wpvp on private servers using older code and far shittier machines. That's not due to "reduced security", that's just because the BFA client we're playing on clearly wasn't designed for that many people. It was instead designed to work around sharding/layering/phasing; which has tons of people in total on a server but split into small discreet groups. It just doesn't translate well.
---
Pve servers are a thing. Getting camped is part and parcel to being on a pvp server. If you can't handle it go pve server
---
BRE is a lot better for PvE and PvP, especially if you're in a group. Letting paladins/shamans roll for it is probably the best thing to do as warriors would much rather have a BRE, or even an ashkandi in BWL. For PvP hand of rag and spinal is more or less equal due to macespec being pretty shitty.
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
---
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
---
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
That‚Äôs weird. But glad you made it work.
---
you too friend!
---
I wont take the heal into account.
---
On the other hand, the point for arms goes by tacticalastery and sweeping strikes.
---
In any case, dont drop tactical mastery
---
Anyone else think of Jimmy from South Park in the LoTR episode just now? ‚Äú You shall not pah...‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm generally unaware of whatever is meta, but what happened to protection warriors?
---
an artwork
---
Fuck off goon
---
I eat pieces of shit like them for breakfast
---
You are correct! I could swear this isn‚Äôt how it worked but you are right
---
Or they used real time data to add servers as necessary
---
Damn.  I know its too late, but you could have waited until the roll was about to expire and then hit need, giving you plenty of time to loot it before being force hearthed. 
---
Like I didn't even think about that until you just commented, so I will keep that in mind for future reference.
---
It‚Äôs not going to be the difference between a win or loss no matter what class and spec you play.
---
Save your nova until after you bust your load since you probably don't have shatter.
---
Interesting thanks! I'm pretty unfamilair with the place. Always nice to have a tank that knows the place for me lol
---
Depends on what you are doing. If you spend a lot of time doing something like mining the extra speed = extra income and is highly important. If you just run dungeons the speed is more of a luxury item. Will be more important in phase 2 for PvP though.
---
Sample size does not determine representativeness of respondents.
---
Played vanilla, and was only ever camped one time in 2 years.
---
Ally camped there all day yesterday on my server. Literally all day. Was a huge annoyance to be delayed 5 mins to strat.
---
You just got mad that I ignored your points (which I replied to, just in a way you didn't like) and you strawmanned mine xXDDDD
---
Those people already have 2x level 60s with bis on one of them and working on another level 60.
---
For their own needs, not the desires of the playerbase.
---
You come across as a total douche bag who will not listen to people no matter what. So that is pretty amazing and congrats. You need to use a macro to obtain the results you are looking at in the video, if you had looked at the button he is pressing for Feign Death instead of trying to lord over the people giving you assistance with your massive case of douchebaggery you would notice he has a FD macro setup and it's to get his pet at minimum to go into passive mode to stop yourself from going back into combat right away. Continue on being super tryhard asshole though.
---
Why does no one consider cho'rush blade?
---
I agree, why is there no way to transfer off pvp to pve?
---
I don't want to respec prot until I'm 60 and done with most quests. They're painful to solo with
---
From a game that is literally repetition
---
I don't get it.
---
I‚Äôll say you may be better off on a pve server, but I tried to level on a pve server with a friend and it was boring as shit. You‚Äôre going to miss the excitement, even if you‚Äôre not a big pvp guy.
---
You seem really bothered by something so trivial, you feel the need to continue to post antagonizing comments with nothing but name calling, demonstrating your inability to act like an adult in any capacity whatsoever. 
---
I think it's really ironic how heavy you are leaning on insults about age given that you have the actual mental capacity of a small child.
---
Isn't 34 Frost damage better than 29 spell power 10int 10 stam? Seems as a mage you don't really run out mana frostbolt spam in raid. Thought it was damage or bust
---
if you go 2h it is not as relevant as you are specialized , if instead you want to level using 2 weapons ... the result is very gear dependent .
---
Go arms until 40 in essence it is what most warriors do
---
Thank you, I choose to believe it did
---
You had the option (and still do) of playing on a pve server. The game is not flawed, your decision to play on a pvp server seems to have been though.
---
You rolled PvP, what did you expect?
---
evocators blade is sex
---
When you ding 7 and just prepare for the suck.
---
What's the best place to set a hearthstone for an Alliance Mage?
---
Not Gadgetzan because I have the engineering teleport to there.
---
There's 0 point to pvping as feral if you're only wearing Stam/int gear.
---
I'm currently at 22 Black Lotus picked, how about you guys ?
---
It did nothing for him expect giving him the amusement of fucking me over for not obeying him.
---
Powershifting doesn't reapply the Leader of the Pack buff properly. If you are HotW spec, you don't have to worry about that anyway.
---
Nah dude, uncover his name so we can blacklist this piece of shit.
---
It's a meme until my anathema is smacking you. I try to get melee final blows all the time.
---
The unfortunate side effect of classic wow, all the ninja looters came back with everyone else. Not to mention the backseat tanks, that like totally tanked for 3 expansions and has played several tanks and knows what your should be doing bro. Why aren't you spamming cleave bruh, you can't hold aggro for shit. I know my pet is following mobs and pulling extra packs, but just like spam cleave bruh, my friend your level has no problems bruh. You know who you are.
---
Interface Options&gt;Social&gt;Check the box "Block Chat Channel Invites"
---
Find a chill guild and never pug raids, can't trust anyone
---
Yes, this is indeed how people get bad information.
---
https://ironforge.pro/
---
55/45 split is pretty damn near close. This is also consistent with the original census data from the wowhead information posted closer to release. Stop spreading misinformation based on your anecdotal evidence. People camp BRD all the time.
---
Once you get all your pre bis you should be doing good dmg. I'm 60 combat rogue and I am always high on the damage meter if not topping it.
---
A lot of Rogues and melee on my server so getting a group can be troublesome at times. Like others say, start your own group and focus on betting pre bis gear.
---
this is not possible due to the way reset works. more info:  
---
https://github.com/TimothyLuke/GnomeSequencer-Enhanced/wiki/Understanding--castsequence
---
In interface-&gt; social(i think) there is a checkbox for ‚Äúblock chat channel invites‚Äù :)
---
So basically go with Arms, because the would be the only way I could get a 31 point talent with last stand at 51
---
ok boomer.
---
Thats really sad, Ive also destroyed that one but im playing rogue so I can reliably pick locks in brd, but IIRC scholo door is still orange at 300 skill, so it fails sometimes, which can be annoying.
---
I dont understand the whole "unfair" aspect tbh.
---
Weird ass blowin hippies
---
I think you should stay on the pvp server, in long term thats the safe bet imo.
---
It's the 19 bracket BiS Priest weapon afaik
---
You'll be leveling with swords 90% of the way through 60 in my opinion. Here is what I used: Misc Green Swords &gt; Night Watch Short Sword &gt; Shadowfang &gt; Outlaw Sabre &gt; Scorpion Sting &gt; Vanquishers Sword &gt; Hand of Antu'Sul &gt; Thrash Blade &gt; Sword of Zeal. I also used hand of Righteousness to level my maces whenever i felt like it. I debated buying a Fight Club, but got something better, pretty quick.
---
Mace spec is actually very good for the stun while grinding, so if you wanted to go mace spec to take full advantage, its not a bad idea. There's just a lack of good maces.  Outlaw sabre, vanquishers sword, and thrash blade are quest rewards and easy to get.
---
Figure out what your priority is.
---
I was getting camped (5v1) the other night in Winterspring just trying to get some quests done.  I had a bunch of choices which were:
---
* Keep running back and try to be a nuisance and dot them up and be killed again
---
* Log off and go play an alt
---
* Log off and do something else completely
---
* Chill out and wait for them to go away
---
In the end I chose the last option... I had a basketball game on TV, needed to eat so I just let my corpse lay there while they were kneeling around me and I watched the game and made/ate some dinner.  After about 15-20 minutes they got bored and went on their way and I rezzed and went about my questing.  It will only get you annoyed if you let it.  And to your original point you can't expect everyone has the same priorities you do when they are playing... it's a blessing if they come help but if they don't they are most likely doing something important to them.
---
2 out of 3 too. Sounds like it's more successful than not.
---
Was he a paladin upset by your purase holy shit?
---
Naxx will be cleared by your average raider in 1-2 weeks.  The strategy is widely available and tactics are known.  Please stop overrating this stuff.  This isn't like a retail raid where some of the mechanics aren't told to people.
---
The issue is that the servers weren't as robust. Rollbacks on the servers were a consistent thing. I lost gear, quest rewards and hours simply because of that. A group of small time Russian hackers literally held the major servers hostage at various points. The glitches and other minor issues were almost incomparably worse on p servers. There were entire zones that were sometimes unplayable. The list goes on and on. Should I stop here?
---
It has a 100 yard radius and usually if you spot someone just run out a bit and stealth and go back in. It will pick up that you are no longer in the area
---
RemindMe! 1 Day
---
Its cruel that he didnt share it. Come on op!
---
That was the fucking worst in Vanilla. Having people's damage meter sync fuck up and give you bad data, having to get multiple logs and merge them for parsing sites. No fucking thank you. Literally no reason to go back to that just because some people didn't know about addons 15 years ago.
---
OP, can you eli5?
---
I've already blocked channel invites.  Now how do I block the entire message like you're describing?
---
Imply that devs don‚Äôt know how to make a good game. If anything they can easily just let people make addons like usual but only allow certain ones to be used after they review it etc
---
you're still here? go back to WoW
---
BGs will not be out in a few weeks, BGs roll out with Phase 3; it's the honor system that's introduced in Phase 2.
---
Unless they've changed something in the last couple of days that I haven't heard about.
---
So you *do* know these people- the ones who aren‚Äôt knowledgeable of the private server scene.
---
He‚Äôs a weeb, try not to stay triggered.
---
We haven't even decided on a loot system yet. We just recently voted on what day we want to raid on.
---
You did not play originally if you think the classes were balanced. It‚Äôs never to late to start but may be a little rough going if you roll PvP as phase 2 and the honor system will be implemented tomorrow

I rolled a Pally out of pure nostalgia; my WoW heyday was about 9 years ago playing as a Human Pally. Back then I reached 60 about 3 weeks before TBC launched and thus I never really raided in Vanilla. I did however raid in TBC as a tank. 
---
I've been reading that in Classic Pally tanks aren't really a thing. Is this true? Will I have a tough time being viable as a Pally Tank?
---
From what I've seen, It's not much of a difference.
---
Hate to rain on your parade but BG:s come out with phase 3.
---
Spy + mind vision there is no escape from meee
---
Playing horde on Herod?
---
There's a difference between being in your twenties a couple months after launch of you only have a couple hours a week to play and being in your twenties with 25 days /played...
---
Website looks great and feels really nice to navigate. Intuitive, easy access to information, good load times. Good job!
---
yOuR'rE sTiLl hErE?
---
Wait are people going to twink in phase 2?  Is there any reason to before BGs?
---
I‚Äôd be curious too. Bustea is ~/7 days played and takes gold making into consideration along the way. I‚Äôve had a great experience with it.
---
PvP server, level normally until level 48 and then don't step out of dungeon until level 60.
---
Holy fucking shit how many times do people need to repeat this to you. 
---
Evocators blade is a bad twink item, no twink will want it. It is bad and useless.  Evocators blade is a bad twink item, no twink will want it. It is bad and useless.

---
You would also have to clear twice the trash because of aggro radius.
---
Gl in naxx
---
Nah. The unlimited range of mind vision is max level. The only other rank is 40 yard range
---
are they? i see a ton of alliance smugness as well, especially if you watch any streamers. i would say both sides are equally smug.
---
honestly, not sure why anyone would take it seriously though. i view it as just a bit of fun trolly roleplaying that encourages a bit of faction rivalry.
---
I seperate groupchats, guildchats, LFG, have a seperate window for loot and some other windows.
---
We need the spelling so we can convert it into binary, then we can build the command for you.
---
Recent private servers had daily peaks of 10-12k(higher on patch days), no layering, and performed exponentially better than what we are experiencing so far in classic.
---
You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
---
stay mad
---
Grab him by the bush!
---
Yeah because that's not boring
---
It was whatever the warlock in the group gave me.  Possibly they messed it up!
---
You should be banned from here too
---
Some fuckin salty haters here.
---
It's a white item. How good could it be? ;)
---
Holy shit you're a fucking moron.
---
Sounds like someone used to play Eve Online....
---
Can someone explain to me how it works?. if it only reads the combat log then how does spy go off when an ally flys by on a flight path?. Does it say "xxxxx flys by you" in the combat log? Or if someone is afk in a hut, how does spy read them if they're doing nothing that would go into the combat log at the time?
---
Are you asking now you have time for a new hobby?
---
I'm happy you're so angry.
---
You can tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese text?
---
**W E E B**
---
As salty as the tears you keep spilling.
---
Ah man that is just delicious
---
I feel you man, I too feel sad when no one wants to gank them gankers  
---
I look forward to wpvp and am always eager to help an comrade in distress, but not everyone wants to do it.  
---
Asking guildies for help could work if your friends are into it.  
---
There's not a clean solution to the problem sadly.  
---
In my experience, our guild does a good job helping others, and we've flown across a bunch of zones. So I guess what I'd say is ask your guildies, if unwilling to help maybe find a guild with same interests as you?
---
Awesome, thanks! I'll scour through all the settings pages when I get off work.
---
Very mad.
---
How does it feel continuing to support child labor and slave mines by posting this on a device that uses precious metals mined in blood?
---
We can play this game all day.
---
&gt; making Corruption instant for warlock
---
Can't you already do this with talents?
---
^ But I did have a kid in my guild back in wrath get kicked for bypassing the filter by spacing out the letters. I assume kids do this because they don't know you can turn the filter off?
---
Alright mr sheep calm down
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs EVERYONE ELSE who has the problem here, not you. /s
---
so mad.  can't even tell you how mad i am.  its unbelievable how angry
---
&gt; It is automation 
---
Not according to the ToS.
---
Like honey.
---
good taste ...rly
---
It's a silly thing, rank 1, 2, and 3 have the same icon, but rank 2 has a separate color than 1 and 3
---
ez 65% attack speed :)
---
If i have dalrends sacred charge and thrash blade, which should go in MH?
---
Whua? NO!
---
Had an alt NE spriest for pvp back in retail vanilla... Greatest time ever with the combination of shadowmeld, esp in wpvp. I'm horde this time so undead racials gonna be real nice. But will always miss shadowmeld
---
But the important question is, did the streamers get in, because that's all blizz cares about
---
A lot of top Guilds were doing a last attempt at speed clearing MC before Phase 2 hits and everyone starts Ranking, and a lot of the clips from other Guilds' POVs are just meant to poke some fun.
---
Despite losing a few top DPS due to saving them to a cleared MC, we still managed to beat everyone else's times while bringing almost 3 times as many casters as we were planning. Hope the video sheds some light on how to run MC fast, and pump.
---
As someone who plays on a RP(pve) server i never really bothered with the random-worldpvp.. loved the leveling and the general attitude of the players is pretty chill aswell. With battlegrounds missing the rivalry is completly gone tho, opposite factions members greet eachother at meeting stones and help u kill a mob if u struggle. Looking back im thinking i actually missed out on alot of fun and action playing pve-mode tho, the only pvp we had was a raid on the city where enough enemy faction players pvp-tagged to protect their npc's.
---
If you're a rogue looking for a gank or troll in the enemy faction city you're gonna have a bad time, everyone is unattackable... my recommendation is to take the pvp like a man and see everytime you get ganked as "atleast there was action.. unlike on pve servers"
---
It‚Äôll be relatively the same? 
---
For someone within honor range of the level 60s?
---
Yeah I‚Äôll believe that when I see it.
---
Vanilla wasn‚Äôt that grindy. Just the leveling and initially attunes/gear.  You eventually are supposed to get into a place where you can raid log or do scheduled runs with your guild or screw around in world pvp. People are going to burn out hard after 6 months of average 2 and half hours every single day as you say.
---
keep it coming keyboard warrior
---
That my point though, beasts drop grey items is essentially their gold drop
---
I like EF more because of the 27 int and 17 stam. Sure +healing is more valuable over all, but there's just so many stats on EF that Red Dragonscale is missing. You get almost 1.5% crit between the crit and int stats, and 405 more mana as well.
---
Your problem is trying to make money on flasks in phase 1. 
---
No one needs flasks right now because MC/Ony are easy and puggable. 
---
Try focusing on crafting cheaper consumes that people are using more regularly and especially take a look at pvp-oriented potions. There's plenty of money to be made. Save flasks for phase 5.
---
Thank you so much! Will do it asap
---
One button priest pls :)
---
Can you make me a small one for an aquarium?
---
Nope. Money is more important to Vavendi group, or Activision, or whoever owns Blizzard now than you enjoying yourself without being verbally assaulted.
---
lmao says the guy who started trolling to begin with
---
It was patched like a month ago check patch notes
---
Question is, will Flasks ever be required for raids.  As in, will the progress be stopped, 100% without it?  If so, then Blizzard will need to step in.  If Flasks are not required for raiding, and can be mitigated or worked through with gear and tactics, then no, Blizzard should not adjust the spawns.
---
Yes because a pserver turns off server side authentication, or minimizes it.
---
The reason the lag happens is because every action needs to reconcile with every other action, thus the more players you add, the more actions the server has to resolve, exponentially.
---
If you don't have this reconciliation then it's almost impossible to know what 'really happened.' It also opens the game up to all sorts of client side hacks, and yes private servers configured in this way would have no protection against these hacks.
---
To illustrate imagine someone with 0 ping and someone with 200ms ping. Both have 1 life, both cast instant cast fireblast on one another. Player with 200ms presses button first. Player with 0 presses after. Who dies? Blizzard servers reconcile all actions to determine the outcome. It does not rely on the client to tell it what happened.
---
how so i see how long the auctions i post last for on Auctionator?
---
Noice
---
That better not be you Toof!
---
lol you're still playing?
---
You don‚Äôt need prot spec for dungeons so no point in respec until 60 as leveling prot spec is slow and boring
---
Well stop thinking about looking at them then duuhh
---
Using a third party website that only uses recorded logs, and has been found to be missing logs.
---
Not a good metric for server population.
---
Yeah my troll is too tall with the raptor, I‚Äôm always having to dismount to go inside places
---
or my sword is now my gun post
---
You're not wrong, but the link he posted showing instant dropping is a video from 2006.
---
How do you make it work? For me it simply says wrong client.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, gatekeeping at its finest.
---
If 10 days /played is average to ding 60, and the game was released eleven weeks ago, that's just shy of 22 hours a week or three hours and change *every single day.*  
---
That's more than half of a full time job, and for those of us who have (and aren't neglecting) families, RL friends, home upkeep, and other adult responsibilities, that much free time doesn't exist.  But I guess we "aren't playing the game" at all if we can't devote a fifth of our total waking hours to it...
---
&gt;Its maybe boring as shit to you..you probably want to do what you do on retail aswell..
---
This is peak /r/classicwow lmao
---
only a lowly 50 and you can catch me hiding in instances!
---
Since when is hitting 60 in 2.5 months hardcore? Just because you're slow doesn't mean they're rushing content.
---
Your arguments make you sound like a piece of trash. I don't think you are, but read your comments and think about what you're saying. The hypothetical makes sense if no one saw or cared about the subtle needing before and suddenly a BOE drops so the leader doesn't want ANOTHER item going to the bastard. You don't know the situation and assuming makes you look like trash. Again, I don't think you are, your comment is...just very telling. 
---
And once again you show your leniency for injustice by saying "this is Reddit, were not beholden to innocent before guilty". You're right. This isn't a courtroom. These rules were made law to keep justice Just and protect from garbage people starting up witch hunts. 
---
IM NOT SAYING YOURE A PIECE OF FILTH, but your comment shows us more of who you are than you probably care to üòâ
---
What he saying is
---
Stay low lvl as long as possible so we can milk you for honour as you slowly climb
---
Most people who are 60 have lives outside the game. It's been 2.5 months dude.
---
now kith
---
get a grip.
---
I do no for a fact!!! that thos quests do unlock the repair guy.. Again idk what patch in vanilla it was implemented.. And as for classic.. Idk if it is active now or later patches .. But they will need 2 be completes to talk to him.. Now or eventually
---
Never sell that weapon.. just occasionally whisper him and ‚Äúlink‚Äù it.. even though links arent in classic.. just to remind him
---
Based on what facts? They changed Devilsaur spawn times a few weeks ago. Cut them basically in half.
---
I'd say it's almost a guarantee they increase the spawn rates one way or another in the next 3 months.
---
"Pushmybush" sounds like the name of a player that would do this.
---
Can confirm. Though, saw Critoris once and was jealous I didn't think of it... so who knows
---
Yes it's really important to get a 1v1 when you're decked out in twink gear. Otherwise someone might throw a spanner in your power-fantasy gears :P
---
Nobody used Spy. You people act like everyone was using all the addons when in reality a handful of people were cheating with Spy because Blizzard had no way to counteract it. Just admit you and the rest of the people here defending a non-quality of life addon are too braindead to play the game without cheating. Reminds me of the mentality and current state of chinese gaming - if it helps you win its not a cheat!  It interacts with the environment for you to detect other players and not just Rogues. You're cheating. You're a cheater. Deal with it.
---
you also get EXP on any mob you were in combat with.
---
&gt;I sold two assassin's blades for 80g each
---
Oh God that has to hurt, that sucks you had to sell at such a massive discount. If you waited till phase 3 they would have been worth 400g a piece easy.
---
Doesn't matter what it is. The time was put into it. A loss for no reason still sucks. Were only Here for ~80 years m8.
---
im pretty sure the first few ranks will be easier to get even if more people pvp, the struggle begins at rank 10+
---
That's fine, but do you really think the game should he catered towards people with minimal time?
---
brd
---
Who the fuck are these people? Jesus christ. These are the nerds that are ruining classic. They play 20 hours a day, sit at home and play this stupid game all day. This is why classic is dying. 
---
Progress is a well established guild and even with half their raid dying almost beat these tryhards. Enjoy your two minutes of fame.
---
big KEKW
---
Azshara is an unfinished zone with barely any quests or story so you should be good. Not many people go there for long.
---
Flipping burgers doesn't pay well man. All that time in wow could have been spent improving yourself.
---
genius/10
---
How do you find good guilds with normal, down-to-earth people? Guilds that don't talk racist shit in gchat or name their guild discords "ass and titties"?
---
Jesus christ...
---
urge to murder . . . rising
---
WHO ?
---
I said I got my first flask recipe last night and it's literally the only thing that's profitable.  I use TSM, which scans the AH and does all the math pertaining to "if I buy these materials from the AH and craft potions, what's the profit?"  NOTHING is profitable more than 20 or so silver and then that's pretty much only Fire Protection Potions.  Mongoose, Sages, FAP, etc. are all more expensive to buy the herbs themselves than the potions sell for.
---
I havne't even crafted a flask yet, but those are literally the only profitable items for alchemy, unless you count xmutes, which I don't due to the long CD.
---
I do not like the standart UI myself but I'd accept it if it would mean all addons would be removed.
---
i think its hilarious u kids talking shit about &lt;SALAD BAKERS&gt;. u wouldnt say this shit to them at LAN, they're jacked. not only that but they wears the freshest clothes, eats at the chillest restaurants and hangs out with the hottest dudes. yall are pathetic lol
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you be green and the evil group leader be red?
---
I respecced around 54.  Spamming anger runs and then leveling in LBRS was way more efficient for me than staying arms.
---
Yea I watched the video. I dont know what kind of quantifiable information I'm supposed to get from it, though.
---
But how much are the 4 Runecloth bolts and add the 60 silver or whatever it is for the Rune Thread... then take the 5% AH cut into account.
---
I have thought about doing this not sure it's that great of a money maker especially if you are buying your mooncloth.  On my server Felcloth are 3 gold so I can make a Mooncloth for 6 gold....every four days.  But the numbers for Mooncloth (about 16 gold) and Mooncloth Bag (20 gold) make it a very low margin on the bag(s).
---
I am thinking of farming Demonic Runes and selling Felcloth pieces as those seem to be  a lot more expensive but the farming will take time (... as a bonus it will get Felcloth also).
---
You want us to help you determine which one is more casual and friendly? Just join each one within 5 min of each other and say "hello everyone". Whichever one gets most responses, form a guild with those people. Casual servers are going to have people rerolling on a whim, or starting their 4th or 5th alt, or doing what you're doing.
---
&gt; As a rogue main, the information this addon gives is absolutely anti fun  
---
Rogues are antifun. There's nothing fun about getting stunlocked to death from a pussy rogue. Spy isn't going anywhere and threads like this bring more attention to it. Have an upvote.
---
Once again, just because something was possible then, doesn't mean it should be possible now. Blizzard and players before could've deemed it fine, but now players and devs once again have the power to think if its fine or not. I'm not against addons, i just think the argument of "if was fine then its fine now" is not a good argument.
---
&gt;  the server has to send this information to your client for the game to even function
---
true, but blizzard can hide it as they like or limit player access
---
Alot of arguments circulating around here are similar to yours, "it was fine then, its fine now", but no one is actually discussing whether or not its good for the game as a whole, and whether its good for players
---
Yes it will, it will break almost all of them...
---
I mean thats how PvP servers work. You Probably knew going in, if not that's a shame for sure
---
‚ÄúOffended‚Äù isn‚Äôt really the right word for what‚Äôs happening here. You just come across as shallow and pedantic and not adding anything to the conversation and arguing for the sake of argument.
---
Ah that's a shame I was hoping for WSG in P2 .  Ill edit my comment then , thanks!
---
I raid with &lt;progress &gt;on my main and have to say- grats guys. We thought you stood no chance when you literally AFK'd in front of bosses for 30-50 seconds. But somehow still 28 min world record. Grats, you have my respect.
---
&gt; I can only hope it gets nerfed into the ground
---
Good thing it can't.
---
Wait, what? Source?
---
Not really, because they were just released randomly throughout the day. We rarely knew when the additional server was going live so there was no way to reserve a name.
---
... no? Like 1/3 of the player base is not 60. Plus, I hit 60 on Kronos when AQ was already out I still had plenty of people to play with.
---
You right click on the chat tab example: general and select and click on "settings" a window will pop up with abunch of check boxes on the left there is 3 catagorys "Chat" "Global Channels" and "Other" click on the "other" tab and in the top right corner is the boxes you see on the window UNCHECK the one called "Channel"
---
being protspec is counterproductive. you mitigate too much damage and as a consequence don't have enough rage to build proper threat.
---
Yet again Progress looses to a bunch of gnomes
---
No youre right, just looked it up and WSG and AV will be P3 ,  hopefully they release it sooner though as they did with DM
---
Bad players and good players are still people all the same.
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=free+action+potion&amp;s=g
---
Depends on where you want to go. You have easy access to most of the world already. Maybe Theramore for being close to ony? Or the plaguelands if you're running strat/scholo.
---
It's a graveyard on Rattlegore
---
I have tested this personally and mana Drain doesnt effect druids in forms like people keep saying. It only works out of form as intended.
---
I tested 3 different ways in duel and vs. Horde
---
With shot applied in form no mana Drain. I used 4 mp5 item (staff) after using mana and documented still gaining mana without losing any mana at the regular rate.
---
I tested the same way with shot applied out of form and shifting into form. Still gained mana properly in form and confirmed that the shot applied out of form does Drain mana.
---
Also tested being in form, leaving form and reforming. Same results mana Drain out of form and in form mana is stalled for 5 seconds after cast then mp5 and spirit regen resumes. 
---
The only mobs who seem to mana Drain in form are in DM.
---
How could this possibly be ruining classic? Just because some people are into speedrunning and want to play the game a different way doesn't mean it should affect your experience in WoW.
---
I can literally do what is happening in the video on classic right now though, so we are not sure what "watch the video" is accomplishing. The only time it works differently is when spell batching comes into play and that isn't a FD issue.
---
careful u dont step in the weird nerdy hyperbole
---
There are no ninja looters here.
---
The system doesn't need changing, it's solved the problem already.
---
You mad bro?
---
#nochanges #workingasintended
---
No, US at least still has layered realms.  Tuesday is when everything gets consolidated.
---
You could make developers register their add-ons with blizzard using a unique key, and check which one is making the call
---
Here it is, as long as you guys requested: his name is Pushmybush and the realm is Shazzrah.
---
Twinks won‚Äôt be around for awhile.
---
I‚Äôve been holding onto 3 sentry cloaks that won‚Äôt sell and they are BiS at 19
---
too many crybabies on reddit
---
Sounds like you need to find a new guild that'll align with what you want and how you want to play
---
You and me both. Mine's in the bottom five also. Joined a guild that's trying to break into raiding right now, they just did their first 4/10 MC this weekend. It's cozy, but it's noticeably not very high population sometimes.
---
can't beleve progress got beaten by an albanian roleplaying guild... what.....
---
Lol the info you posted is wrong. You will see in 3 days
---
Thanks bro
---
Dont let this distract you from the fact that eric ciaramella is the white house whistleblower
---
I don't think that is the argument.
---
If you don't want to ban all add-ons, you have to be VERY careful how you try to ban spy. The methods discussed so far would not stop spy or destroy most add-ons.
---
What the fuck are you even on about? How does any of this affect your enjoyment of the game?
---
You'll have to go to pvp hotspots. TM/SS was a big one on pve servers after honor released in vanilla.
---
&gt; It's by definition. 
---
Blizzard has said what the definition is and it's not that...It doesn't matter how you define it, it only matters how blizzard defines it. The definition is what blizzard says it is. So, not automation according to blizzard.
---
Orc is easily the best race in classic. Hands down. Followed by gnome/undead, depending on how many mages/locks/priests on server alliance it's Gnome in classic. If you want to future-proof yourself for TBC, although perception isn't super useful in classic, human is by far the best race in arenas for rogues since it almost always guarantees the opener. Other really good races are undead and gnome.
---
You've got a lot of folks here saying that PVE servers are boring, but having played on a PVP server from vanilla launch through cataclysm, I'm really enjoying being able to quest in relative peace. I enjoy world PVP, when I'm in the mood for it. I don't enjoy getting jumped by a full group of people 10 levels higher than me.
---
Sold assassins blade first week of release for 300g lmaoo, bought it for 10g on AH
---
This is true.
---
200 seems high for Activision xD
---
Its not really being stubborn when you paid your sub fee early to reserve a name on one of the *few* original servers. Why would anyone want to lose their name they essentially paid for to go to a new server?
---
Oh. I didn't mean in stealth. LOL
---
Weird.
---
Also, I haven't played retail since WoD, so I knew none of that.
---
And, the 60s will likely be leveling alts
---
Why you heff to be mad?  Is only game.
---
&lt;3
---
I hope they put it out sooner. In Vanilla I'm pretty sure there was only a month or two between the Honor system and WSG/AV being released. Especially with how fast everyone's playing through Classic vs Vanilla, another ~3 months seems a bit much to wait for BGs.
---
Skeram Horde - &gt;100g per lotus.  Not joking.
---
This. Came live in BC pre patch iir
---
Most definitely have done this, trying to mouselook.  lol
---
So, a castsequence macro activates each ability 1 by 1 as you push the macro. So first time you press the macro if will case zerker stance, second press will cast bloodrage, third press will pummel.
---
That's a way too simple way to look at it... "The bigger pool the easier it is". If the pool is bigger, there's also a high chance that the server is more competetive and that all of the top spots (1.4% of players, rank 11 and above) will be taken by turbonerds playing A LOT. Going rank 10 is probably the easiest right when BGs launch, but going above rank 10 is gonna be a massive pain in the ass for the next year unless your realm is dead.
---
Ctrl-V + Enter is less keystrokes than "We can't help with any of that."
---
Same, I like my guild but we always end up having to be the pug group to a different raids run. Leveling an alt is a little sad because a lot of the lower lvl areas are pretty barren
---
reason stuff is so expensive is because mages are OP and a lot of classes have super broken farming methods
---
leaves other classes in the dust
---
I was in a group yesterday (November 10th) and it dropped for us - went to a level 55 Rogue.  I have seen it three times total now in the past week and a half across about 40 runs.
---
I did the entire head quest in the span of like 3-4 hours total from looking up guides and preparing to camping to killing.
---
2 tries in Silithus and Winterspring, 1 try in Un'goro and Burning Steppes. The FearNG was definitely on my side, but the rest are kinda just there.
---
Find someone else to level with and start a good zone with lots of quests together, then run brd as soon as you can
---
According to the survey on the front page, only 64% of players have a level 60 character.
---
By your logic even playing one character is automation, since that button press still has to go through a program for it to be interpreted.
---
Did someone say Pushmybush?!
---
Damn, they sound like cool guys. I'm a cool guy looking for other cool guys to hang out in my party mansion. Nothing sexual. They are dudes in good shape? If they are fat, that's okay, they should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, nothing sexual.
---
Is his name Pushmybush or Pushmybush?
---
Talk about pot calling kettle....
---
shhh shhh just let this happen
---
Says what? Pushmybush?
---
Nice try Blizzard
---
I say cunt multiple times a day and have not had a ban.
---
ppl will just manage without them, really
---
a healthy player pop is 100000x more important for game health than flasks
---
/ignore Pushmybush
---
didn't even know this existed
---
No, it works off GUID; not current threat. She targets the person with the highest threat first, and goes down the line; but the person with the lower GUID doesn't get wiped (or I have that backwards?). That's why it seems super random, and why people were saying it was bugged.
---
Its not censored.
---
You get a better wand from a quest in BFD too lol, literally guaranteed to you if you run it once.
---
Hey Luke! I'm really glad you made a post about this as I had a few questions.
---
I found your original post on the classicwow forums and then found your Github page. I started using one of the guides on an alt and it has been great so far.
---
Couple questions: Are the guides still being developed or are they mostly accurate and complete? Will there be a 1.0 release or is the 0.2.0 fully integrated and working?
---
Also, I know there are the individual zips to download for each specific race/class combo. Is there a way to use the main program on Github to generate the guides from Classicwow directly? Say for instance if the guides are updated, can the program be used to generate an updated guidelime zip? 
---
Thanks for doing this, it has been great so far on my alt.
---
An ideal BG team has 1 of every class aside from mages and priests which you want 2 of each.

#**&lt;Electric Lettuce&gt; [Horde-Kromcrush] Raiding and PvP**
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
##**Who are we?**
---
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Electric Lettuce is a new WoW Classic guild with end game raiding being a primary goal, with a nice mix of world pvp in mind! We have an active discord community, while voice chat is encouraged, only raiders will be required to have it. We are foremost a group of friends who met on mutual Azeroth adventures, bonds forged in the halls of the Scarlet Monastery. 
---
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now we are looking to gather enough like minded, shocking and high octane fresh greens to take on the Molten Core and everything else Classic World of Warcraft has to throw at us! 
---
- **Looking to raid?** We have recently started hosting our own pugs and just need enough raid ready members to &amp;nbsp;flush out the team, more info on raid times below. We are primarily looking for Healers, Ranged Dps and People &amp;nbsp;willing to Off Tank. 
---
- **Looking to PvP?** There are also a lot of members interested in premade BGs, once released, and world PvP in &amp;nbsp;general. Come join our slaying of all Alliance Gnomes and the protecting of under-leveled Lettuce Heads! 
---
- **Looking for Neither?** Those who are just casually playing and don't know what the future holds. We are still &amp;nbsp;accepting all friendly faces and fellow fortune-hunters to join our rambunctious romaine ranks. Come &amp;nbsp;experience a refreshing retake on your classic WoW guild experience.
---
###Raiding times!?

I think  that he says that on the entire server there are only (at least on his side) 49 people, because it crashed earlier
---
Add-ons like spy weren't as widely used in vanilla so their their functionality changes "vanilla" pvp today. 
---
Using spy and having it alert you when there's a player within 50 yards of you isn't the authentic vanilla experience you're after. It removes any situational awareness and changes it from looking at whats around you to staring at a list waiting for it to populate.
---
If you're desperate to skip the Toughness and Anticipation talents you could put 3 points to Iron Will and then have no more mitigation than an arms or fury warrior. Then you could put a couple of points into utility talents like improved taunt or improved shield bash.
---
You could try just doing dungeons with people.  If you enjoy playing with them over the course of a few dungeons, try asking to join their guild.  Not foolproof by any means, but at least you'll know there's at least one person you like playing with.
---
Crit is near useless for most healers. The only healer that should consider crit is NG druids.
---
Using stat weights for MC to gear yourself is silly. You should be using stat weights that are tailored for BWL fights as they are much longer and gear will be a bit more important.
---
That doesn't seem right, either.
---
If I had to guess, the actual differentiator is likely whether or not you relog after resetting talents.
---
Naice
---
By looking at a video...
---
This is absolutely something my sister would do, only she's been playing since Burning Crusade.
---
She's been playing Classic lately, and just a few days ago I had to explain to soul shards to her.
---
The exact quote that started that conversation: "This game is so fucked up, sometimes it lets me summon my voidwalker and sometimes it won't for no rhyme or reason"
---
Her warlock is 32.
---
Not a hunter but should be pretty lucrative once you can do it.
---
I bought a Rod of the Ogre Magi (from DM North tribute run) from a hunter this weekend.  He's a hunter that apparently can do the Tribute runs solo and then after opening the chest he just spams the local channel to see if anyone is interested in buying what was in the chest.  I am guessing he is making probably 100 gold per hour or more doing it since most of the items in the chest will sell for 50 gold or so.  The rough part of course is being able to find a buyer.
---
Such a force of habit from playing so much Classic lately, i MUST check every insignificant piece of gear i see. Cuz, ya know...reasons
---
I think you over  estimate the difference between the r/classicwow sub and the general community. Originally vanilla release honour 5 mos after release and classic is releasing 2.5 months. It's a little earlier than I would have hoped, but realistically I think the timing gives a similar experience to vanilla.     
---
Comparing classic to vanilla, classic has:
---
- way greater portion of players starting at launch    
---
- way greater portion attempting to go at a faster pace (knowing what they are working towards)    
---
- way lower portion completely messing around trying to just explore and what not    
---
- NPC locations are known and available on search engines (imagine the first wave of WoW players trying to find obscure locations for higher level profession trainers, or the winterspring NPC for Alliance Onyxia attune)    
---
- similarily, the gear available from professions and loot is known and available, streamlines the gearing process    
---
- even amongst players completely fresh to vanilla, most are probably using resources for quest/flight path locations, gear, quest chains etc. ranging from rarely to always    
---
Could go on for days with points. Even if the gank fest is crazier than it was in vanilla, so will people running for alternatives like lesser populated quest zones and dungeons

I'd argue if you're 60 and have a leaf you've got plenty of time.  as Juke2H says below it takes likely 2-4 hours total unless you're unlucky w/ spawns.  
---
You do you but it's a good feeling to do it yourself - imo the #1 best class identity quest the game has ever had through every expansion
---
Who would name child like that D:

This man knows BRD
---
He tanks the entire phase unless the warrior is able to pull ony off of him which hasn't happened yet.
---
It's not really a reset, it supposedly reduces it. And the way my guild figures is it'll reduce the threat on the lowest (might have been highest) GUID (the ID number of your character).
---
So, what we did was have the MT and OT stand together and away from the rest of the raid.
---
Ony snapped right back to them on P3 start; was nearly a flawless victory...think we had 1 death.
---
Easiest way to find this GUID is trial and error (I don't think there's a script that you can run to find it).
---
I never got into arenas really just prefer to spend my time in BG's and world pvp. 
---
I did think about gnomes if I choose Alliance, but I thought rogues have more utility to deal with roots than they do for stuns / fears?
---
I guess against a good frost mage with some lucky freeze effects, escape artist could be really useful after blowing the other cd's.
---
Yup, same here. its crazy how easily my mind can go from "watching a video" to thinking im the one playing LOL
---
Black bear or Grey bear. I see Bear in the tag and I kill all bears until the Q is complete. No use thinking about it.
---
&gt;This is not even pvp... It's just griefing.
---
It isn't, by Blizzard's own definition you are wrong.
---
&gt;Look for a mass exodus to come after phase 2. People will quit or xfer.
---
Been hearing this along with "Classic is dying" "Classic is dead" "Classic won't last a month" since it started.
---
I'll keep playing and having fun, meanwhile people will scream that the game is dead at the top of their lungs.
---
&gt;Why?!? Do you still have delusions that this will be Tarren mill vs South Shore?
---
No, I believe it will be wPvP and people won't run by me anymore without trying to slaughter me. 
---
&gt;It's just going to be people griefing other people. There won't be anything close to a fair fight to be found.
---
I never wanted a fair fight.
---
Not at all. /r/EmpireDidNothingWrong .
---
Gotts take it with a grain of salt.. It is however very useful in looking for relative upgrades and where to get them.
---
Unfortunately no DM gear is on there, at least not when i check
---
Seriously, i feel ya man
---
Same, but lucky you don't have cheeky friends like me that will give ya the boot when you make fun of my dress!
---
I just hoard boxes on a bank alt because I can't be bothered to go ask someone to open them...
---
Check, check, and check. I still capped in early October. It‚Äôs okay to admit you as casual
---
My bet is that BGs come around Christmas.
---
Wow you need to roll back that drama a hair
---
Not bad, but I would cut the google/keyboard part out next time. Length kills memes.
---
I dont think you understand what a dishonourable kill is
---
Let's just go classic+... Make boomkin viable.  I wanna be a chicken without being a laughing stock.
---
&gt; he does TL news and is part of all three riad groups logs, but not a member of the core.
---
News is social bullshit - being in all three raid groups tells you he's not core, he's filler. You literally proved my point for me, thanks.
---
Storm and TL doing something mutually beneficial doesn't mean they aren't cutthroat when it isn't mutually beneficial.
---
Are you this dense in all things, or just when you're whining?
---
You're wrong.  Polls across several sites have shown a mass majority of the player base are not 60.  The average player is in their 30s currently.
---
Probably can delete the cache folder where ever it is.
---
I think he means 3-4 days in time played
---
I mean it's been reported as a bug since beta and I've personally seen it drain Mana when it's not supposed to. I can test it again when I get home.
---
Damn... that sounds rough
---
I would love to hear your rationale behind where you get your facts on average player level. If the average time to 60 is 2-3 months then we are right in that window, meaning that a majority of those who started when classic launched should be 60 by now.
---
It happens to me in PvP/PvE as a Tauren Druid too.  I warstomp for a 2 second stun, and immediately cast regrowth.  It's a coin flip whether spellbatching comes into affect to see if I get "hit" AFTER I stun the guy while I'm already casting my healing spell.  
---
This literally breaks my combo of stun and heal if I get spell knockback by the enemy AFTER I cast a stun and they can come out of stun and kick/interrupt me before my spell goes off.
---
You're one anecdote vs 15 years of known data.  You lose.
---
How am I supposed to roll it back when this is a massive nerf to the class I play, a class that's already underpowered in PvE?
---
Welp, I'm 48 on my Shaman so yay...?
---
They have changed pretty frequently so I usually just try to get a feel for it each time I farm them.  Sometimes it feels like they change day to day, I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on there.
---
Lol, i‚Äôve seen it listed for that. I have two on my account that i hope increase. I thought it was Gonna be valuable early I bought one for 5 gold early, Ended up getting a drop twice while farming (thanks layering!) so i just decided to make a warlock and carry it around.
---
I am lousy with evoc blades and amy had a lot of blankets.
---
Its called a weekend because the week ends on sunday and a new one starts on monday. Why whould factories and stores be closed on the first day of the week?
---
Are you talking about the user "pushmybush"?
---
Prior to that, I believe, it went like:
---
Launch: Just there as a marker; "meet up at the stone"
---
Mid-way Through Vanilla: Meeting Stones act as a mini "LFG Tool"; putting you on a 'bulletin board' for that instance, so other's can invite you.
---
TBC: Meeting Stones renamed to Summoning Stones; now act like Lock summons.
---
Noose
---
Probably bored farmers. A lot of 60s chilling around there for the Devilsaur leather, plus a LOT of chinese gold farmers are there. Been talked to in chinese and broken english many many times by the farmers.
---
I bought mine this weekend in just that scenario for 50 gold.  Was in Feralas just dropping a quest off and saw him in local spamming for a buyer.
---
He invited me and gave me his discord and just talked me through running with him back through DM-North.  There was only one spot where he provided me an invisibility potion to get past a mob and that was it.  We ran up to the chest and I looted the Rod and gave him 50 gold.  Took about 10 minutes total... easy peasy.
---
Improvise, adapt, overcome 
---
Or reroll on a pve server
---
That's still 7 days played, I was actually slow as hell on a warrior and was 55+ IIRC at that point, but people really try harding hit 60 in 3 days played.
---
I'm not saying you have to rush, but even with your really limited time due to taking care of your 2 kids (which obviously comes first) you could still be 60...
---
If someone is not 60 I guess either they aren't playing, or they're purposely rolling very very very slow...either way I'm not sure if the game's deployment should be balanced around them.
---
It's not
---
Cookies is major for a leveling priest, wanding is like 50% of your damage.
---
i get out of my chair and bend over while herbing to enhance my classic experience
---
Amen brotha
---
No but it's very, very valuable. It's saved my life more times than I can count
---
Only if they outlevel the multiboxer.  If they‚Äôre on level and have their shit together, they‚Äôll generally get whacked pretty quickly.  Mages are one of my easiest kills because they think they can kill me easily and then they eat a pyroblast/deathcoil to the face.  Usually that forces an ice block, and then we play ‚Äúwatch me cast spells at your immune ass until it drops‚Äù.
---
The only ones who are really bad are priest and warrior fear bombs if I don‚Äôt have fear ward up.  Warlock‚Äôs are hilarious when they try howl of terror because it‚Äôs got a cast time, so of course they‚Äôll eat a stun or a counter spell or the ‚ÄúI win‚Äù button. 
---
Against similar numbers of accounts, it usually an even fight give or take, but even then I‚Äôm not usually looking to fight.  Most PvP I see is at instance entrances where you‚Äôve got 10 people of either side holding the door, and being a PvE multiboxer isn‚Äôt going to sway that one way or the other.  
---
Otherwise, you‚Äôre talking someone PvP oriented, which means a bunch of shamans or mages and maybe a priest, and that‚Äôs much worse than any of the crap I can throw at you.
---
&gt; How are you timing a half second delay on someone else's client?
---
It's my 3 PhDs. Wouldn't manage to without them.
---
For real,  i mean i play super casually IMO .  maybe 1-2 hours every other day or so,  i'd say closer to 1-3 times a week, same with most of my friends.
---
We're all 60 and do MC pretty regularly with PUGs and started a few alts now.   If we're doing this while being super casual i can't imagine the hardcore players or other more serious players. 
---
I actually havent played in about a month or so because the only thing I had to do to kill time was either dungeons or open world pvp for no honor.   I'd love to have BGs to kill time with again.
---
Shhh! Are you trying to get suicided?
---
Lots of pointless discussion, thank you for actually trying to bring up a relevant fix
---
Yes, that poll includes people who pretty much aren't playing the game, like people who log in once a week.
---
The games deployment should NOT be balanced around those people...
---
Put the weapon in the trade window.
---
Cursing doesnt get you banned unless its racist. Hence the foul language filter option.
---
But to get to BRD you either have to jump or take the chains, which means you‚Äôre still not getting there...
---
It's literally not a cheat. You not liking how the game fundamentally works is not a cheat.
---
&gt; If anyone gets remotely close to me stealthed or unstealthed their addon goes off and instantly knows of my presence.
---
This has been ingame forever. Gladius. It warns you when someone stealths, trinkets, stuns, kicks and so on.
---
What server
---
Hol' up...
---
I'm probably mis-phrasing it, the GMs didn't specifically agree on the bloodlust decision. They just said they "don't interfere" in party leader's right to choose to kick somebody, and that I had no log of being on the boss's loot table so there was nothing they could do.
---
I don't really agree that there was literally *nothing* they could do, give me an AP token and lie to me about that being my drop from the chest. Whatever.
---
Multiboxers aren‚Äôt too different from the roving gank squads.  It‚Äôs still usually a 5 on 1 fight you lose just by the number of bodies involved.
---
It did work like how vanish works, so you could use it during Ony phase 3 transition to drop aggro,much like a rogue does with vanish(and as I mage I can confirm this is how it worked). But since Ony is a raid encounter, no 1 will ever actually leave combat(even rogues that vanish) but it still does drop threat. 
---
Outside in the open world, it again would work just like vanish and drop combat. Now it's been ninja nerf'd/fixed and no longer works this way, which makes it completely useless now imo.
---
I agree with the fd/trap being critical for hunter pvp. This is also why I can confidently say this is working pretty reliably as I have spent a large amount of time world pvping and dueling in classic already. I use a pretty simple macro so maybe that is not your issue. But, I'm sure we can figure out what the issue may be if there is one. Batching is definitely something to consider at times, but, also at times people can be very preemptive and know that FD is coming and get an attack off the moment you do it and get you back into combat, this happened even in vanilla and without batching, just sometimes shit happened at the exact same time and prevented it. But, if it's happening to you all the time, something else is going on, as I have used this macro and have trapped many a rogue and warrior pounding on my ass in an instant.

Some people use /petstay at the end of it to keep the pet near the target for when you break the trap it will get be on top doing damage right away.
---
this. mained one for nearly all of retail
---
Haha, good point!
---
That's my point.  Reseting BRD involves running in and out of spot a long ass way from the chains.  Camping BRD portal misses the traffic going to MC and BRS.  So if you want higher honor kills and more of them, waiting for people to reset to gank them is going to rank low on the options.
---
Don't use flurry axe, level is too low to use crit stones on it, making Bone slicing hatchet and serathil much better weapons for your off-hand. Both are also pretty easily obtainable boss drops. Keep in mind that they're only better when you use crit stones. Don't blindly follow BiS lists, many are wrong/made with 9 rather than 6% hitcap in mind.
---
What server?
---
ahhaahah
---
Visit Blaumeux. BRD portal is camped by horde 24/7. The only time there is not is the few minutes after an alliance MC raid group rocks through and removes them.
---
oh no D:
---
And I do :). I'm Not one to complain about it
---
&gt; it‚Äôs unnecessary for anything outside of raid tanking.
---
It's also unnecessary for raid tanking, Prot is unnecessary in general.
---
I'm sure once the Honor System goes live, even PVE servers will have a few skirmishes break out.
---
This is the rogue portion of it which is pretty much untouched: https://wago.io/gqlmzUtnx
---
He's the string if that's easier: https://pastebin.com/dYgzdtkn
---
This is original the healthbar portion of it: https://wago.io/EC73LA7qn
---
I removed the mana bar and changed the dimensions to match the rogue bar, which you can import with this string: https://pastebin.com/WQ5Q6W97
---
Gotcha thanks.
---
Oh, a 23 alt too, you're not doing that bad then at all.
---
Wait a minute
---
They have actually banned certain boss mods in the past. DBM is the "fair" version. I actually agree and think we should ban all boss mods, weakauras too. They are just too strong. These are also the reason certain raid bosses in retail are so insane on mythic difficulty. Blizz has to make the encounters more complex to deal with the fact that everyone has DBM and weakauras.
---
They don't ban for swearing, thats why they have a mature language filter option. If bad words make you upset you can just turn them off... unless its racist or death threats kind of stuff.
---
Didn't they up the spawn rate of Devilsaurs because it was obnoxiously low? Also mafia.
---
I would like to see this requirement removed, as well. It's fkin dumb.
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-level-60-in-wow-classic-an-objective-look/
---
To summarize some of our favorites:
---
At 10 hours played per week it will take 5 and a half months to reach level 60
---
At 20 hours played per week if will take 2.8 months to reach level 60
---
Even if you play 40 hours per week it will still take you 1.4 months to reach level 60
---
So I would have had to play, on average, 20 hours per week to reach 60 by now give or take according to the math done on warcraft tavern.
---
Yes. As long as the rules are stated in chat beforehand. The only thing thats gonna happen tho is that the GM is gonna delete the item and give out a warning.
---
He did, its "Atrocious".  Dunno why he has a problem with it.
---
Everyone look: A coping mechanism for the mind of a cheater. I feel sorry for how pathetic you are. It must suck to suck.
---
Idk what to tell you man. No offense but the games been out for almost 3 months now, anyone who rolled on a PvP server thinking P2 wouldn't be out in around that time are kind of at fault here.
---
Like, if you're just now 40 you're probably at least another 2-3 months away from 60. Did you really think it would be almost half a year before P2?

---
\- \*\*Looking to raid?\*\* We have recently started hosting our own pugs and just need enough raid ready members to \&amp;nbsp;flush out the team, more info on raid times below. We are primarily looking for Healers and Ranged Dps.

With that I have no idea about unfortunately
---
This is a dumb question, but what IS the honor system? What does it do for you? Again, brand new wow player with classic
---
I'd say that's about right. Both Orc and UD will be strong for classic.
---
In vanilla it depended on class, that's just how it was, so that's why you such different answers
---
8 days played is a very, very generous estimate and only for those with an eye on 60.
---
if you did professions, or gathering complete sm set or other things like that, you will not be 60 at 8 played.
---
Why would the MC raid group run all the way to the portal and then back to the attune location?
---
Also takes some practice and it isnt a short gy run and instance run if you die at princess. I tried a half dozen or so times as shadow. Got to princess, though the little goblin boss or whoever he is was a dicey battle. Princess kept catching me. And yes had run speed boot enchant . I'm sure it was just my approach, but it's not a gimme farm. Just to provide some caution for the OP.
---
OPie
---
An addon is just a bunch of different LUA calls put together. How would this work? At what point does it become an addon? One LUA call? Two? 
---
How would the game know that the separate calls being run are all from the same addon? There is no functionality currently that exists to "key" an LUA file.
---
 I dont think people understand, they arent going to pull all this bullshit 'but what ifs' to change one mod that does what mods did in Vanilla. People just need to get over it.
---
Again, people aren't understanding how addons work. They aren't like skyrim mods or something.
---
To dick on some horde.
---
Yea I figured you wouldn't have a great answer for that. Truth is, that video tells you nothing without additional information. Like I said, GL!
---
Where did you get that average? It took me 9 IIRC and I was very VERY slow as a warrior who was forced to eat dick.
---
Fastest is sub-3...so I'd say average is probably 5-8...7 is around 15 hours a week which is NOT a lot...so I don't see how this is crazy at all. I just responded to a post from a dude who said he plays 10-15 hours a week and has 2 little kids to take care of.
---
Your numbers are skewed.
---
Luckily it is only worth like 30g
---
You clearly state in your ticket QUEST ITEM for both items you want restored.  The response you got was an answer to recovering deleted quest items.  The response was correct. It isn‚Äôt the GMs fault that you gave him blatantly wrong information.
---
It might seem like something trivial to differentiate between a quest item and quest reward to you, but they are completely different game objects.  
---
Your ticket could be made into two sentences:  Hey, I accidentally vendored two quest reward items.  Can you guys restore them?  
---
It isn‚Äôt rocket science.
---
 yeah I really like the, playing Alt while main gets rested then grinding dungeons for a few hours on rested XP. Basically what ive done since I hit SM on main.
---
I'm able to get up the ramp with a lesser invis pot. I don't get how speed on boots would help, don't you have aspect on? It's a tight squeeze but it works great and you don't need to waste the more expensive invis pots.
---
Nah this is my first PvP server I had no idea what I was going to be in for for p2 in terms of the level range of honor farming.
---
I mean I knew about honor etc but I didnt know for example 60's farmed level 48s etc. Just didnt look that hard into it my friend group wanted to go PvP server.
---
I feel for you man. But this is what makes classic different than retail. Everyone calls retail dead because they suck out all the social interactions from an MMO. That means both good and bad social interactions. 
---
Half the game is playing with people and socializing with them. This means dealing with jerk raid leads and also means finally finding a guild that works for you. The feeling of being in a great guild with people that you can trust can only be appreciated if the world allows both good and bad social interactions. Take away those interactions and you get a dead game like retail where no one talks, other people don't matter, and the whole game feels like single player with random NPCs you run into once in a while.
---
What server is this?  I have a shamelist of every one of these mofos.  Cancer.  Reputation is huge in Classic.  These guys are finished.
---
Every man for himself came with the WoTLK content patch. It did not exist through the majority of TBC
---
Since no one is asking the hard questions, I will: What class are you?
---
The lasz one I dont agree with. With how it is now, it is so much better for people below level 60 zo make gold.
---
Whwn I leveled I had to sell everythibg to vendors.
---
Now on my mage I farm small flame sacs for 1.2g each.
---
Sorry. Wasn‚Äôt trying to imply you can‚Äôt tank raids unless you‚Äôre prot. That‚Äôs jus where IME you start to see tanks pick prot really at all.
---
You actually still get loot even if you're kicked right after starting the key, assuming the group finishes the key. If the chest drops anything for you it gets sent to your mailbox. It also counts for your weekly chest.
---
According to their math average of 20 hours per week puts you at 60 around now.
---
But is it like 5 minutes or an hour? Do you have a guesstimate?
---
Autobar might help with that. It comes with a general button 'bar' and then a class-specific bar.
---
I can confirm that conjured food/drink appear on the general bar.
---
((I'm a paladin.))
---
Nice thing about Autobar is the general bar is shared across all characters. So you don't have to worry about it changing item slots or location on alts.
---
....I think the class bar location is shared, but, obviously what's on the bar is not.
---
Maybe that rogue should be a little more careful when trying to ninja cap a node?
---
You need to be in either storm wind or org when someone hands in the head of onyxia or neffarian. Usually about 30 minutes before the raiding guilds start their raids. Like it all the raid guilds start to raid at 7:00 sever time expect the capitals to be packed by 6:30 so all the raiders get the buff
---
Except the imbalance between factions which would split people between vtc and classic. Alliance players for the most part would not want to move over because tbc it was all about horde rofl stomping ally in 90 percent of all content. Newer guys and people who want a huge cliff will go alliance tbc. But that causal check it out? Nah. I don‚Äôt think they would beyond doing the basic content. They‚Äôd have to figure something out with balancing. I don‚Äôt think you realize just how skewed the population was toward horde because of be‚Äôs
---
1/3 of players arent even 60 yet.  Game is not rushed they said.........
---
/ignore pushmybush
---
The second there is a viable pserver alternative that provides a service equivalent of what the lights hope team provided I guarantee there will be a  exodus of the hardcore playerbase if blizzard hasn't fixed the issues before then.  There's really no reason not to play somewhere that provides a better user experience for free.
---
This argument doesn‚Äôt work, here‚Äôs why:
---
There was only ever *x* lotuses that would spawn in any given timeframe. Lotuses were spawning faster, and were ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to stockpile, but still only *y* people could stockpile them. 
---
You can‚Äôt possibly be suggesting that everyone be ahead of the curve and stockpiling lotuses while there were several layers, because ‚Äúthe curve‚Äù necessitates people being on the back end. If demand exceeds supply, only so many individuals can have the item.
---
It doesn't "scan" anything. It parses the combat log and highlights relevant info. According to you, reading your combat log is cheating.
---
I am on westfall and having a blast. Just add production to your ignore list, and it's smooth sailing.
---
/r/thathappened
---
Its a non-argument from the mind of a cheater. They are so dependent on cheats at this point they use every avenue to not call it a cheat. Its literally exploiting the in game code to do something the devs never intended and give you an advantage in PvP. How dumb does someone have to be to not admit they are getting a huge advantage in player vs player with this addon? But what can we expect from braindead people who would rather rely on a bot playing the game for them. Their defenses must also be braindead
---
LOL @ comparing this post to societal values.  And comparing this to our political climate.
---
Like I said, you're getting way too caught up.
---
I worry about that too. My guild has been bringing in 10-15 pugs and recruiting some of them for these runs. It's fine I guess but the realm feels sort of inactive.
---
So how does that not counteract your earlier opinion that a small minority are at 60 by now?
---
That's bullshit lol. If you're in the 30s you literally don't play
---
Keep coping cheat bot.
---
Got my epic mount, full t1 and both t2 and all bis piexes, sulfuras, thunderfury, 20k gold, 8 bank alts full with black lotuses and arcane crystals, I've even blackmailed a GM to spawn and kill kazzak for me.
---
Hehe a little lat to the party guys!
---
I've been trying to do pickpocket runs to farm for my epic mount and the amount of times my vanish has failed to drop aggro makes me wanna flip my table.
---
i did say 50% of the time.  It does make you vunerable but you also dump huge amounts of damage.  Got it from Rextroy

ok zoomer
---
BGs certainly reduced the amount of mass world PvP like TM vs. SS and city raids, but it did still happen in late Vanilla, unlike any expansion. More importantly, with tons of reasons to be out in the world at 60, small scale world PvP was alive and well. Honor farming was not something most people focused on, because it was unrealistic for most. Instead, they PvPed for fun. Flying mounts, among other TBC innovations, utterly killed that off.
---
How can you even compare those two rofl 
---
I know my rotation should Blizzard allow rotation bots as well
---
They are for sure chad gamers with mad skills and should not be messed with! the monster pop means business and all beta guilds should bow down to &lt;CHADLAD BAKERS&gt;
---
lmao me too
---
After about 4 attempts I learned it very well. Use Barovs, and swiftness potions until you get the pathing down, its a gimme. But yes it takes time and requires the boot enchant.
---
Your leveling will be harder once you hit level 50.
---
Pre level 50 you are not worth honor to the level 60 rankers.
---
Fastest Naxx and MC clear ? I was here
---
Your pet attacking puts you in combat. Not the guy attacking your pet..
---
Had to come back to this because I had the random thought, is generating an entry for buffs a bug? I'm thinking that's probably how weak aura's works. If A casts moonfire on B, then B is seeing every second tick of moonfire on the default UI and weak auras is scanning thier combat log and showing A how much time is left on the dot. It would probably be the same for buffs, if I can see on my UI an update every minute/second my buff tics down then that has to be logged somewhere in the background and available for an add-on to call
---
If they nerfed it later, I doubt it‚Äôll be nerfed on classic launch.
---
&gt; In fact I think PvE would be more fun if less addons was used, it would be harder and not only about pushing numbers. 
---
This is just as naive as saying nameplates being visible from 60 yards away is okay in world pvp.  In PVE we have 40 people to coordinate and if just one person fucks up, it can ruin 40 people's time. In PVP, you have significantly fewer people except for AV. In PVP, if just one person fucks up (outside of AV) they don't directly affect the play experience of the other 39.
---
"Quality of life" is a dirty phrase. That's literally how you got retail. Why spend hours lfg? We can automate that for you! We can even add players from other realms so the queue is shorter!  
---
This clearly would not be a quality of life change anyway, but a change to functionality and gameplay.
---
Strictly speaking, there is a way to ban addons.  It has been done in the past*, but it really only works for AddOn authors who don't want to earn ire from Blizzard, since like you said, on a technical level, this is fairly simple to recreate.
---
*I forget the exact circumstances this has happened in the past, but when I worked at Blizzard, we blacklisted certain addons from loading basically via name.  I think this was mostly for nefarious ones, not ones where we didn't like gameplay consequences.
---
It's a valid concern.  The level 50+ zones will be essentially unplayable for levelers unless their faction is dominating the zone
---
Sorry I'm just sorta new to classic, dunno how the game works on a later level
---
Definitely agree with this, the daily QA thread is really the main reason I even visit this sub.
---
Well call it a reimagining.
---
Its... not about actually tricking them with FD though? It's about dropping combat so you're able to cast freezing trap.
---
several being one other time next to this comment
---
I have to ask, how do u make ur actionbars black like that? üòçüòç
---
Fresh 60 vs someone decked in mc gear will be pretty rough. The top weapons from raids are massive boosts over pre raid and all the tier 1 has tons of raw stats.
---
Also keep in mind most pre bis lists are aimed at pve not pvp. I cant give specific advice for rogue but in general you're going to need more stam and probably less +hit gear for pvp.
---
Less boring than being stuck on a PvE server at 60.
---
Sounds like a mistake that you even got to roll
---
yeah it seems borderline broken to me, I have it fuck up more than work correctly
---
I don't think you could get banned for slander.
---
And I'm certain that this guy doesn't know what slander means
---
Shows how much of a joke classic is.
---
Most people flag up by attacking someone who is flagged. When there are 20+ players on each side attacking each other, everyone stays flagged. Are there PvP objectives in the game? I didn't think those were a thing until much later.
---
After all the responses to this, i am very very glad i am not alone in this LOL
---
yeah dude, it was Faerlina. It was a pretty clean experience to be honest, no complaints from me. There were also a TON of people too.
---
If you haven't completed the Onyxia Attunement quest chain, I would highly recommend doing so. If you're horde side, the chain involves a LBRS run, 3 UBRS runs, and 4 elite dragon kills around the world. Really time consuming but the quests themselves net 50-75k exp not to mention all the exp from killing things in the dungeon runs.
---
Another quest chain you should do is the Tirion Fordring line. Again, good exp from quest turn ins and gives you an amazing healing ring right out the gate.
---
Otherwise, run dungeons for gear to get ready for raiding (if that's your end goal). Lvling while gearing up is much more effcient than hitting 60 with full greens and then having to find gear.
---
ok
---
Haha welcome to our club!
---
gotcha, so prot till 60 then swap to holy for raids
---
You can see in [this video](https://gfycat.com/secretalarmingcapybara) Swapping to plaguehound leggings indicates an EP of + 6 over devilsaur but breaking the set bonus causes the EP to go down overall as well as the hit overall to go down. Set bonuses are reflected in the gear scores.
---
40 no. However at 48 you become green to a level 60, thus offering juicy delicious savory Honor
---
Someone made a good comment about it on another thread.
---
Limit the combat log to only show when enemy players attacks and spells affect you.
---
I think that could work.
---
not even just as a rogue. an addon like this shouldn't be in game.
---
I have been using dense sharp stones, and I am a dwarf with edgemasters, as is in my post. Would you still use flurry over mirah's in that case?
---
My goal was to show you have no idea what you are on about, your goal was to downplay someone's achievement and lie about their character and circumstance, to make you feel superior. Idk what was moved, but at least my goal was made.
---
Better give that mageblade to the guy who only raid logs and does as much damage as a spriest!
---
Name and shame.  These guys are finished with a bad rep.
---
holy shit relax man wtf
---
Yeah, they aren't going to basically kill off the whole WoW addon scene. They don't have the time, effort or willingness to even want to do something like that. They would have to literally go through every addon by hand to approve it.
---
A system for authorized addon usage already exists, it's called protected functions. Only the WoW UI can call them. The calls that Spy and many other addons make are not protected, if Blizzard didn't want people to use them, they would make them protected calls. If you can run a function in the game, it means you are allowed to, period.
---
I am willing to bet money they will not change a thing.
---
and the server dropped like 30 min prior , they must of done something to make it more stable? hope so at least
---
GG salad bakers ofc
---
I want to clear some things up.
---
A warrior with thunder fury, threat/thorns food, and a reflector can do equal threat to a prot pally in terms of aoe tanking. The difference is that a warrior can survive some pulls while a pally will die due to lack of survival cd.
---
Skarm tank on YouTube has a video about it.
---
Thank god smarter people are in charge of this game
---
Boy this comment section sure is something.
---
you're upset that you're behind, and your plan is to stop playing and come back later.
---
10/10 logic
---
I mean... do whatever your want, but your plan is only going to exacerbate what you're feeling.  I suggest just playing if you're having fun and not trying to compare where you're at to other people.

Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don‚Äôts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. With three current raid rosters, one for every day of the week, we have all days available for you to raid. All raids will start at the same time (5PM PST).  However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 5-8PM PST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can‚Äôt roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* A large collection of people who share similar interest in PVP and PVE alike, of all levels of experience
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won‚Äôt stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who‚Äôs friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you‚Äôre a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you‚Äôre a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla ‚Äì you‚Äôre welcome, and you‚Äôre wanted.

It's just for people who understand that demand will increase when bgs are out.
---
Grind undead in WPL and EPL... it's not glamorous but it's honest work.
---
Ah.. I thought it was just 5 levels.
---
You did not need to tell him this. 
---
Any rogue , at that level, who doesn‚Äôt realize sentry type mobs ignore stealth, isn‚Äôt worth trying to teach.
---
In mythic+, you get 3 items per run if it‚Äôs timed until you get to much higher level mythic+ levels. The loot is divvied out at the end of the dungeon in a chest because it‚Äôs timed and standing around looting stuff in a timed dungeon doesn‚Äôt make much sense. 
---
So if you kick one person, those 3 items are more likely to go to you.
---
I had read from a few comments/threads on this sub stating they changed the honor system to drop for tomorrow. World bosses Thursday.
---
Yes, and AV
---
That‚Äôs not really what premeditated means
---
I bet that's why he got kicked!
---
Dunno, outfitter isn't updated for classic
---
I hate to be *that* guy, but the first dwarf I killed(who was chasing a fleeing horde) dropped it. I shrugged and went back to turn it in.
---
This is an entirely different issue.
---
lol. Then whispers to not be stupid next time, removing his entire false justification? Interesting Tactic.
---
Doesn't matter, if I got kicked like that I'd need on it no matter what.
---
Libel
---
Spiritual healing is trash. It's only 10% of the tooltip of your spell.
---
I guess maybe for progression? But what sort of progression is there even? My guild isn't exactly cutting edge (we started 3 weeks ago) and went 10/10 our first raid week...
---
The healing demands simply aren't there for that build right now
---
How would you know if I was a jackass?
---
Have you ever grouped with me or actually interact with me on WoW?
---
Or are you just basing this off of my name and guild and server?
---
Assuming the pet is max loyalty you would have to kill it hundreds of times with 0 feedings before this would happen
---
\*Libel.
---
Also for anyone curious, digital communications are considered libel, not slander.
---
That's him, since the other one says "you" and there was only two need rolls that indeed is the douche.
---
I know right where does this guy get off telling you how to bind your keys.... lol...

That's what happens on high pop servers
---
I expect to be downvoted, but that‚Äôs the biggest problem with wPvP in this game. Tons of people who seemingly enjoy ganking 2v1 or 3v1 and /laugh at you afterwards. If the average Classic player was in high school or even university I‚Äôd understand, but most are in their 30s. SAD.
---
10g is an absolute steal. It will be worth 10 times that if not more when people begin splashing cash on Vanity items. I would keep it and sell it later if I were you.

---
Would be funny to see you using actual arguments, instead of parroting "cheats" like you just recently learned the term
---
Except the fact of the matter is not everyone has hours to spend playing the game every day. I get your point, and I think OP is being a little over dramatic, but if I only have 2 hours to play on a worknight to level my main and 1 hour of that is spent getting camped by enemy players (got camped for almost 40 minutes trying to get into BRD the other night before calling it and giving up on playing that toon) that have nothing better to do with their time, you see where it gets frustrating.
---
Yeah well, I am not saying it's likely. But it IS possible that someone looted the corpse just before the kick. 
---
Allowing a witch hunt based on this, is like putting someone in prison with mediocre evidence just because: "Would be a coincidence if he actually just arrived at the scene in the wrong moment...nah he's guilty"
---
Cause these cases actually exist.
---
To be fair, you rolling need on it before discussing it with everyone how to roll for it is BM. If it is a boe blue worth something, you shouldn‚Äôt auto need just because you can use it. Especially if it isn‚Äôt even lvl 60 gear.
---
Removing social consequences from social interaction causes a feedback loop of toxic behavior. It's why saltiness is rampant in online games. Same reason why road rage is such an issue.

Phew, thanks for pointing that out. As someone who has lived in the ghetto most of my life, I'd never felt so poor as I had thinking nearly 20% of people on WoW had 5000 gold or more.
---
windsor frenzy big brain time
---
it's a weird time too since 20 man raids / BGs aren't out yet, the first people to 60 have already farmed everything and the next wave are starting to hit around now.   now's not a bad time to level an alt really but give it a bit for guilds to finish leveling / merge / get started.  Ashkandi does seem a bit behind but there's still multiple guilds on each side with full mc clears.

Nice, I'm at 130ish runs and never saw the Zevrim one.
---
Context matters. For example, if he‚Äôs a rogue and declared he would need on a BoE like this, and the other guy actually needed it, the kicking would be justified, albeit pointless since he would still be able to roll on this piece. 
---
Still, if someone Needed on a BoE in my group, I‚Äôm dropping the group or kicking them, and I‚Äôm generally the tank.
---
holy shit i actually remember this post

Oh wow! Yeah I knew nothing about it but when I googled it and saw how rare it was and that it was a pirate hat, I figured it'd be worth more.

Think if I wait until phase 2 it'll sell for a lot?

It‚Äôs not bs. If you say WPVP is flawed and doesn‚Äôt work, go to a PVE server bro. Then you‚Äôd probably cry that your quest is being camped though.

I have an orc warrior at 35 and a human paladin at 38.  Also have several other alts in the 10-20 range.  I just like playing different things from time to time.  I'm currently focusing on my paladin though since I'm so close to getting my mount.  I'm not saying the game's phases should revolve around players like me, but to say we're "literally not playing" is bullshit.
---
It will probably only increase in value because people get more money and there won't be many hats in circulation, so you can sit on it for as long as you like, whether that's selling it in p2 or in a year. You can sell it when you need money for something or if someone is paying an extraordinarily high price for it at some point. I bought one myself for 3g when I saw it at the ah and it's been sitting in my bank since.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you play one account on Kromcrush with a small group of friends or actually get out in the world solo. But as someone who has multiple accounts on Kromcrush on both factions at 60, the previous guy is right. Horde out number and also out camp any alliance. Alliance might win a fight when a guild is moving into MC, horde on the other hand literally just sit at the entrance for hours on end. Why? Because it‚Äôs a PvP server and they find it hilarious to camp level 50s. And that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt expect the Alliance side to grow. I know multiple people switching to Heartseeker and it‚Äôs not because of ‚ÄúPvP‚Äù it‚Äôs because people who find camping low levels fun is vastly skewed to horde. At least on Kromcrush. I‚Äôll be keeping my horde there because it will just become worse for Ally. My ally is switching with my guild when transfers open as the guild decided to wait for BGs since we already can‚Äôt level alts in a timely fashion in any zone higher than Wetlands. 1v1 and 1v2s are fun. Consistent and constant 1v5/6/7/8s are boring and kind of game ruining for anyone who can‚Äôt live on the game. The only solution I see are faction based queues, but I don‚Äôt see that happening. Cheers!
---
Dude my brother got to transfer over but I'm alliance as well and now I can't play with him.  To add on, half my guild was able to transfer and the other half is stuck on Stalagg.  WTF.
---
Right.... because speedrunning isn't a legitimate thing and everyone could do it in under 3 days of playtime if the really wanted to.
---
cool. I'm interested in Itemrack. Instead of keybind, we would have a clickable button somewhere to switch outfits as well, right?
---
The best reason to play a paladin is because you'll be at the top of healing done and the bottom of overhealing. The BoP, the Sacrifice to make poly useless in group combat, the Salvation (with a proper raid comp of 5 hpals), the fact that you can invalidate half the mechanics in the game on a 5 minute cooldown, single-handedly save a wipe with LoH, a run back (and your own repair bill!) with DI, and be the only healer with over 8k armor in PvP gear. Freedom is pretty slick too.
---
I play on a PvE server and sometimes riding around EPL I get the message ‚Äúyou must be flagged for PvP to capture this objective.‚Äù A quick google shows that this might be ‚ÄúA Game of Towers‚Äù?

They won't change the API on Spy because doing so would break hundreds of addons, thats why.

Fucking deal with it.

It won‚Äôt link the item info. It will copy-paste the name

Yeah I can't consider that actually paying the game or even a main. 7 days in retail??!!??
---
Having everything spoon-fed to you by addons is really low IQ in general. Like people with diminishing return addons and enemy CD trackers, like fuck off.
---
Aside from this being a change to how the game worked in Vanilla, this would still break many things (Damage meters currently show enemy healing done to other enemies, or enemy damage to your allies). On top of this, that would only really stop the stealth part of what Spy does, the addon does a lot more than that.
---
I don't know if I agree about city raids.  We city raided far more often in TBC than in Vanilla (anecdotal, this was just my guild) because of how much DK's ruined you in Vanilla if you tried to city raid.  We used to raid Org a least every month or two in TBC for the fun of it, but in Vanilla we never did because of how worried we were about DK's ruining our modest honor progression (most of us were rank 8-10).  
---
Small scale world PvP was absolutely finished off by flying mounts, no disagreement there.

Yah, it's quite pathetic.  Last night there was a large raid of level 60s in raid gear grouped up with the sole purpose of griefing people trying to go into BRD.    How do you have time to waste to grief other people on this scale?  Do these people have no life at all?   They have to be on like welfare or something.

---
Lipo*
---
Technically its libel as it was written but...
---
So on your points....
---
1. Shred is poor in PvP. The only reliable shred attack you'll get is your opening pounce &gt; shred combo or a stun (bash/stomp/grenade) &gt; shred combo. After that, your opponent will constantly try to face you, to prevent a rear attack (since a rear attack has a higher crit chance, breaks line of sight spell casts, etc), so you can't depend on your shred against any competent player, and end up using claw instead.
---
2. Feral Instinct is unnecessary in PvP. You need to pounce from behind, where no one will see you in time anyways, so no need for Feral Instinct to get that pounce. From the front/side, you always have to give opponents a wide berth, because you never know how someone will move, so the extra buffer that Feral Instinct gives isn't necessary. Thus get 5/5 Thick Hide instead.
---
3. Keep Savage Fury. It's too good of a talent, as Maul &amp; Claw are your primary attacks. Keep Brutal Impact as the extra second of stun is worth a lot. The choice is Improved Shred or Primal Fury, and I'm on the Primal Fury side.
---

Cool alright, that's pretty exciting. I'm tempted to just put it on and be the only dude in a pirate hat but I know I should wait.
---
Man, I wish I were on that server. Might roll something just to laugh at the asshole.
---
The only thing that I'd be interested in seeing added would be filtering based on raider/initial status and static locations for counts. Otherwise, I love it!
---
PvP to PvE should be allowed.
---
PvE to PvP is bullshit and should not be allowed
---
&gt; It isn't, by Blizzard's own definition you are wrong.
---
Luckily blizzard doesn't define English terms, do they?
---
Wow I didn't know about this addon that's awful
---
Yup. I tanked Scholo the other night at 57 and it took a lot longer than it should‚Äôve simply because of the amount of trash we had to clear.
---
I never said it should, but to say players like me who enjoy leveling are "pretty much not playing the game" is bullshit.  I'm just an altaholic and sometimes I like to play horde, sometimes I like to play alliance.  I also pretty much never get to play for long sessions unless it's the weekend.  Phases shouldn't revolve around players like me, but we ARE playing the game, and there ARE a lot of other players like me.
---
The video editing is just as obnoxiously high octane as the rage in both sides of this comments section
---
U just wanna abuse it for PvP, so u compare a pve addon to it. I couldnt care less about a pve addon, who is it affecting? NPC bosses? Also u dont need dbm to know when to run out of meele range on rag, know who has living bomb etc. Its not really a huge advantage compared to the spy addon.

There's definitely kids in classic. A lot of the younguns checking out what they missed, and verifying all the fables we tell.

I wasn't aware they didn't stack.
---
Yeah, I use aspect. There's no way it would work without, even with 18sec pots, I don't think.
---
This would still break many things (Damage meters currently show enemy healing done to other enemies, or enemy damage to your allies, as just one example). On top of this, that would only really stop the stealth part of what Spy does, the addon does a lot more than that (unless that's the only part you think is problematic).
---
I‚Äôm largely no change, but I think there‚Äôs some major and minor changes that would really help the game. For example if they made sets have more stat options and maybe rebalanced some of the rarely used specs so players could have some choice in how to play.
---
Other than that, I don‚Äôt really want to see custom expansions. Maybe if there were planned raids/dungeons that never got released they could do those. Or add heroic difficulties to current dungeons and raids.
---
I thought it just failed me a few times. Didn't know they went ahead and stealth nerffed it...

It's like undead. You know majority of them picked it for the pvp so they're probably gankers.

That one is hard to beat for the money.
---
If you're splitting time between numerous different characters, you're clearly not who I was talking about.
---
Literally cannot be nerfed or banned, anyone who knows anything about how addons function know this and keep saying it, but everyone seems to think they are smarter without knowledge of API's and LUA, and think they know better.
---
There's more horde on PVP servers, and more alliance on RP servers.
---
However, I think kids and adults alike are jacking off on the RP servers, eLust knows no age.   
---
I'm on a pvp server/horde and I'd say our median age is 26... I'm the old man at 36.
---
Here's the funny part---- WTF did Blizz think was going to happen.......  only way to vote is with your dollars.  If this transfer fails, although it pains me, cancel my subscriptions.
---
Please tell me this is satire.
---
Ahhh childhood cartoons. Thanks for that!
---
What server are you on?
---
I just dinged 20 as an alliance toon on kurinaxx (rolled here cause IRL friends chose this server) and it‚Äôs sad to see how little alliance there is compared to horde. I know it‚Äôs still pretty early in the game but debating if I wanna roll to another server... :/
---
Can't imagine playing on a non-Faerlina server tbh. Couldn't be me
---
Ok, Karen.
---
oh hamburgers
---
Crushing blows aren‚Äôt really an issue. Just means you get hit about as hard as a warrior would, as opposed to a lot less hard.
---
people who rolled on a pvp server are bitching about being on a pvp server.
---
Thanks, I'm 26 now - would anyone recommend this over the Bustea horde levelling guide?
---
Yeah, I was saying that'll be the only safe place to level after P2 lol
---
Reroll PVE like you should've in the first place
---
God damn blizzard, we ask for faction restricted transfers but not like this. That sucks some people transferred and others didn't...
---
 I took the Passive Aggressive approach when it happened to me...
---
"Congrats!  That will be a great upgrade for you in 4 levels when you can equip it."
---
No idea what you mean with BG9. Is that some obscure private server or did you cherry pick one Battle Group that fits your argument?
---
Wouldn't it be libel since it was written and not spoken?
---
Nice I'm on a PVP server.
---
I'm sure I'm entitled to something but I just don't know what it is.
---
Wonder how many people started harassing a person over an item in a video game.
---
Classic isn't dying. Who the fuck are you? You sound like a bitter rival on a drunken rant. Your entire post is garbage
---
Seems like the whiny horde players got their way.  But now, many Alliance players are simply going to quit, so they still aren't going to have their faction balance.
---
"And here i am dinging 60 from the chromie quest!"
---
do you use dbm? do you use any addons that give you a better read on your dots/buffs/debuffs? are those not all dumbing down the game? if you use no mods then i buy it but if spy is dumbing down the game so severely so are any other mods that manipulate available data in the game to make it easier to parse. considering reading the combat log is pretty much the same just more annoying i don't think it's severely dumbing anything down, just saving me from having another big window open.
---
The blizzard guy who told you you cannot get it back is totally incorrect and should be fired. I deleted an item purposely and two weeks later restored it using this blizzard website https://us.battle.net/support/en/restoration
---
You could go install Project 1999 and grind out a few levels there for a bit, then return to your druid.
---
Jokes aside, I guess you could try grabbing some agility/strength stuff and solo leveling using feral cat. At least that helps to switch up the pace a bit.
---
Or maybe work on an alt to help break up the monotony until you're ready to return to your Druid and bang out some xp.
---
Other than that, I don't have much to offer.
---
This is why you always roll Need on twink items and other valuable items.
---
In most cases ppl leveling fast ruin the experience of the slow levelers...ganking, economy, overgearing, trivializing content, etc...
---
Depend. If those are the words he used, he won't get banned from 1 time but if he has multiple reports from different situations where he acted this way, then probably yes.
---
Yeah but if you say a small minority are 60 then I would assume you KNEW that or at the very least were part of a large group of people who also agree with you. If you ask around I think a general consensus on the time to hit 60 is around 2-3 months of dedicated playing a single character. Seems like the majority of people then already have a 60 and have probably likely begun leveling their alts.
---
This exactly... I play 3 hours a day got a warrior to 38 re-rolled and hit 60 two weeks ago.... most of my guildies have an alt in the 30s to 40s now to
---
Why would you want your addons to be less modular?
---
I didn‚Äôt expect this to be such a controversial comment...
---
Dishonorable kills aren't from killing low level players. They come from killing low level pvp enabled npc's. So if you run into astranar and aoe all the alliance lvl 27 npc's you very dk's. You can still stomp all the level 28 players with grey names that you want, they just don't give honor.
---
you are horde you should be fine.
---
Yeah but who cares if you're sitting around in IF with some shit purple weapon from BWL. Now if you have a hand of rag, that's some quality standing on IF bridge gear.
---
I gotta say, but I think your mentality is pretty shitty. All ‚Äúreserved‚Äù loot rules are bullshit. To think you have some right to something because you ‚Äúput the group together‚Äù seems childish and selfish. Last time I checked, this is a game that requires a group to accomplish a task. I ran Jed 98 times and lost the reed 10 times before I got it, I never once made a ‚Äúreed reserved‚Äù group. I am, I think more people should have the, loot will come eventually mentality, because it will. Especially when it comes to dungeon loot.
---
NO CHANGES   &gt;:)
---
&gt;What am I doing wrong?
---
You're leveling as resto
---
Held hostage is exactly right. They must have seen alliance rush the queue at 2:00:00.001 and panicked.
---
Yeah it‚Äôll be around the minimap like most addons. You can just click it and select your set.
---
I see. Thanks very much for the answer. 
---
That's something at least :)
---
What a crybaby üò≠
---
Let's be real the Gray Bear wouldn't be next to the road either, but way in the back requiring  several other mobs be killed to reach it first.
---
Wow there‚Äôs at least 20 people!
---
Dont sit and look at LFG, start a group yourself.
---
I didn‚Äôt reserve my name and I got my mains name from live
---
Get to 58, then do scholo and strat. Goes very fast then! 50-55 is by far the hardest imo
---
Nah, most people don't read reddit, most people aren't hardcore. You'll see zero difference in 99% of cases.
---
Yuck. Then I feel like good hearth options are Southshore, Everlook, Theramore, and Booty Bay. All depends on where you want to spend your time.
---
This is on Kurinnaxx, pretty sure Alliance slightly outnumber Horde.
---
DoTs are fun
---
Can we start a petition? Seriously, fuck this addon.
---
Yeah. Grouped with prolapsimus last night. He was a POS.
---
another crybaby [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/duntkz/spy\_classic\_addon\_should\_be\_removedbanned/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/duntkz/spy_classic_addon_should_be_removedbanned/?sort=new)
---
Sold one for 90 like a month ago, people just see Epic and think it's a good deal
---
Give Prot Pally a taunt so we can be viable main tanks.
---
100% agree. It's horrible when playing a hunter. I used to get the jump on people with track humanoid, however these days they target me before I have even got to/seen them. The addon is is like a wallhack and better than my actual ability.
---
BG9 was the best battlegroup by far, the one that attracted all of the best arena players in the US.  Basically every pro arena player came from BG9.  Back in TBC and WotLK getting rank1 on BG9 was considered to be by far the best achievement possible in PvP.  
---
Just getting glad on BG9 could be nearly as difficult as getting Rank1 on some of the shittier battlegroups.
---
Calm down Satan...
---
Actually, no, that seems appropriate, carry on.
---
Please tell.me there are some rage whispers that ensued.
---
Don‚Äôt know why people say this all of the time. I‚Äôve been leveling perfectly fine, maybe a bit slower, but it‚Äôs not like I could AOE grind xp as feral either. Plus I‚Äôve been primarily running dungeons since 50 so Resto has worked out just fine. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Watch out for spies. Just sayin!
---
owned pussies
---
Damn, sucks to be him now. I'm gonna guess a lot of people from that server blacklists him. Just watch out for a namechange and this player trying some petty bullshit again.
---
Closer than someone not named after a character in the movie the line was from. Close enough.
---
Last night I was creepin on this orc hunter in stonetalon mountains. I watched him from afar and he took on 3 or 4 mobs at once. So, naturally I sheeped him and let the mobs kill his pet, then turn on him. I got cut off because of other players but after escaping I crept around the battlefield juuuust quickly enough to watch him die 30 seconds later.
---
Ah I feel you!
---
And you way undervalued your assassin blade by selling them now as opposed to waiting.
---
No but if you do every zone quest (saving nagrand onwards for 70 for the bonus gold) it ends up just over 5k
---
Welp, you saved me the enchanting mats! Cheers.
---
And to the same tune... the people you are expecting to come and save the day are also likely playing their main and only have a couple hours a day. Why expect them to come help potentially die and get spawn camped when they can just continue in their merry way questing somewhere else....
---
Me and my friends are going to Anathema but 2 got their transfers and the other 2 of us didn't get it so now we are split on what to do this kind of sucks
---
I have no idea what imaginary comment you‚Äôre replying to but it certainly can‚Äôt be mine.
---
Thank you for introducing me, I feel honoured.
---
or you could forget all that, spec fury or arms for full damage/threat and be the better tank.
---
Anyone looking to rank by farming those who are not looking to pvp are going to be at the low end of their brackets.  
---
The Meta will become BRM or TM/SS for pvpers looking to keep up with their weekly honor to get those rps.
---
Every second not pvping and that decay will get ya.
---
This is why I haven't grouped for any dungeons yet. I feel like I'd definitely get kicked or something. I was in a group the other day and the healer was telling me to do something and I had no idea what they were talking about lol. I asked them to clarify and they were just like "forget it".
---
These fucking people are so stupid.
---
Imagine thinking pve is a fun way to play a game called world of WARcraft
---
Yeah but if you're there for the lotus, might as well eat up all the deserter debuffs. You had to queue up from battlemasters in towns, right?
---
I definitely want to start running strat/scholo but most of my main dungeon group isn‚Äôt quite up to level yet, so it‚Äôs been primarily ST and BRD... I was spamming BRD arena trying to get a certain pair of leggings for a couple of days but I think I‚Äôve given up on that because if I have to run arena one more time I‚Äôll lose my freakin mind.
---
What level can you start healing strat/scholo?
---
You have 15 days played you can't find groups you're not 60 and "leveling has slowed to a halt"
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt know why people say this all of the time. I‚Äôve been leveling perfectly fine, 
---
It seems your problems go deeper than I can help
---
I would do winterspring, or something in western/eastern plaguelands.
---
If that. I‚Äôve probably wasted that much listing it and now it‚Äôs just sitting in my bank.
---
Hahaha this is gold, that‚Äôs totally a dick move on the party leader‚Äôs part and if it were me I would have sent him a pm afterwards stating, ‚ÄúTriggered much? =}‚Äù
---
nope, "true" system
---
Joelmcheal should have won.
---
Big yikes. I keep making excuses for Blizzard in my head... but wtf lol. Why wouldn't they just lock character creation for unbalalanced factions back during launch? Instead they wait for people to play for 100s of hours and do this half-assed bandaid solution
---
I wouldn‚Äôt find groups any more quickly on a spec that I have no interest in playing so...? Don‚Äôt know why you came here just to insult me but you‚Äôre edgy, pal.
---
LOL! They just royally screwed themselves over.
---
Honestly I know you said you're kind of burnt out but BRD runs are great xp. Good drops if you just do arena/angerforge runs. Lots of warriors want those drops and their are some goodies for casters too. You could try DM East as well. Quests are fine but dungeon grinding was supper straight forward and fast and the chance at some spiffy drops. Most important try to build a solid 7-10 person friend list who are always down to help it makes the game very rewarding. Biggest thing is no one wants to join a group with one person who doesn't have a plan.
---
No harm in dropping for engineering. Most of the clothies in my guild dropped tailor as soon as they crafted their robes.
---
Servers are supposed to be the same without layering aren't they?
---
I mean at the end of the day, shadowweaving is what you're there for, but shadow priests can still do a respectable amount of damage! I would say if you have a good relationships with the other priests in your raid, roll for the eye! Anathema hits like a truck and is by far the best weapon you can get as a shadow priest. Throw +30sp on that bad boy and you'll be hitting some big numbers.
---
My only advice is to be on top of your consumables. Nightfin soup for mp5, Major mana pots (chug these like crazy on boss fights), +shadow damage elixirs, and if you're really loaded and need something to spend some cash on, grab a flask of distilled wisdom. Showing up to each raid with the proper consumables shows that you're prepared and willing ot put in the resources for more dps.
---
Robe of winter night bis for shadow casters for a while.
---
If I farm the waters myself and but everything else I make 100g profit at least. If I buy everything it's about 30-40g profit per robe depending on the price of waters. For a while I was the only one selling these and selling for 150-160g with like 130g profit if farming the waters.
---
Does it still reset your threat if you're in a group though?
---
I say fuck it lets ruin all the add-ons. I'll be good without my dps meter.
---
Blasted lands has tons of veins that nobody touches, mithril * small thorium
---
Or they stayed because that's where their friends were, or where their guild was. Making sweeping generalizations about the factions is silly. Saying this is all horde's fault is silly. The fact of the matter is that the servers now have even worse balance issues. Alliance leaving already imbalanced servers only made matters worse, I'm not blaming them, but it's how it panned out. I think in time things would have balanced out but everyone jumped ship before it could happen. I don't think the servers reach their current levels of imbalance without brigading or server transfers. FWIW I'd rather be on the underdog side, but I'm playing this game to hang out with friends and am not going to play by myself just to feel good about server balance.
---
Libido*
---
Bloodvine set from ZG when it comes out.
---
I don't know if this is the right place for this, or what exactly I'm looking for. I'm a total newb. Like, played wow on a free trial in 2008 with my girlfriend newb. I've played other MMOs, City of Heroes a bit and Guild Wars 2 more casually as a relaxation game. I have a lot to learn.
---
I'm in NA rolling a horde mage to start (might try a warlock later and see which sticks). I'm trying the game out for the month to see how I like it, so I'd like to have as good a chance at a good experience as possible. Hmu with advice or a chance to party up or something
---
I totally understand it... I work also.  That's where the other options are better - hop on an alt, etc.  Or join a guild and look for one that values world PVP that would come help.
---
Or roll PvE which is what everyone says.  Point being I guess that if your time is important to you and it's frustrating that you can't accomplish what you want - that is the exact way others will feel if expected to drop what they are doing to come save someone.
---
I think I am just jaded also... I have been grouped with too many players where they are five levels below the opposing faction and then they attack them - then hope that everyone comes to their aid.  Without knowing the full story I don't drop what I am doing to go help typically.
---
That's fine, I don't enjoy the game play style though.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm sure there will be more BRD in my future. Most of the people in my main dungeon group are low 50s and I still have to do my MC attunement. Just taking a small break from BRD for a day so I don‚Äôt go crazy. üòÇ
---
No, but they define what griefing is in their rules and ToS for the game they developed, if neither of those are broken then it's not griefing.
---
But either way, it seems like you're happy to scream grief at the first instance of PvP.
---
I'd suggest you reroll on a PvE server.
---
Crafting mooncloth after your BiS chest will probably be the only good thing to come from it. I‚Äôve been buying stacks of runecloth for 1.1g/ea and buying stacks of rugged leather for 1.2g/ea and making runecloth bags. You‚Äôre not looking at much but if you can control the AH with the runecloth bags, then they‚Äôll sell and you‚Äôll profit 60s-1g/ea depending on the market.
---
&gt; say hi to reddit
---
wow you sure got him
---
Yeah slander requires the statement to be false. What the dude did is not slander
---
Some people just want to see how quickly they can do things.
---
If your guild is actively making sure everyone gets gear before your shadow priest, i'd suggest finding a new guild. Just because there 'job' is to keep shadow weaving up, doesn't mean they shouldn't get upgrades to improve their dps.
---
Thanks :-)
---
Welcome to phase one. Let's just call it the first block of a 26.2 mile marathon :)
---
I agree with you but I don‚Äôt think reddit is the best metric to use
---
The context is all right there in the picture. He got kicked before anyone rolled on anything.
---
What did you think would happen when you decided to play on the server that has all of the big steamers?
---
ST and most of BRD are below your level. That‚Äôs probably a large part of your issue.
---
How is possibile
---
This idiot is trying to transfer to Heartseeker. LOL.
---
&gt; You don't know where they stealthed
---
Spy provides player coordinates, so you kinda do. 
---
&gt; You cannot target them unless you can physically see them.
---
This is true, but it allows you to spot people you can‚Äôt physically see. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying it should be banned but it‚Äôs just disingenuous to imply that it‚Äôs not providing a massive advantage.
---
bye!
---
That is so satisfying. Wish you left the names. Haha
---
True... but finding a 19 with the medicine pouch is very rare
---
People who either sort by new or spend too much time on Reddit are complaining about seeing the same simple posts on this sub. These are the same type of people who get pissed at guildies saying ding or linking a gear upgrade.
---
If you are coming to Heartseeker alliance. Seriously, fuck off.
---
Yep. Person who wrote that flat out doesn‚Äôt play mage. I‚Äôd consider rogue a 50/50 as well if everyone has all cooldowns including prep and snap
---
Our guild wants us to flask/pot for MC trash.
---
The idea is to see how fast we can clear it as co-ordination practice for later. I don't have the time to grind that sort of gold though. The goal is sub 1h.
---
Might have bitten off more than I can chew.
---
You're not making your case any better by saying that vanish which has a much longer CD shouldn't get the same fix, but feign death should.
---
Maybe you should of said yes and added it as a paid function before someone did it for free ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And there's nothing wrong with that, but you can't also be the same type (not saying you are) who turns around and complains that content is coming too soon because you aren't 60 yet when you choose to play alts and invest your play time into other shit.
---
Why would you consult the gods by sacrificing a gnome? We don't want that shit...
---
tis a very exclusive club. Glad to have you Dodoni
---
This is par for the course if you are trying to gear.  I did 35+ Arena runs to get a belt for my Warlock.  Other instances you have better luck... got legs out of UBRS on my 4th run.
---
Download Questie ... it will literally show you all the quests in the various zones available for you to pick up.

I used this at 40-60 and had a blast

---
New here? There is always a problem to complain about lol
---
GSE is a bit complex at first, and I don't know about weapon switch. It does work perfectly fine with the sort of macro in this post / video. Your best bet is go to the lazymacro forums and get one of the scripts for your exact class / spec, then make changes.
---
Basically on top of normal castsequence for your rotation you also get extra actions on button press and release and the end of the rotation loops. You also don't need any "null" tricks to prevent the castsequence from getting stuck when the next ability is not available.
---
Will they? Why? Nothing is forcing Horde players to move. It will not fix the issue unless you do something to motivate Horde to transfer, like a Horde-specific login queue
---
Change to an enhance shaman and get a different legendary
---
I agree classic is just a better game all around, but it is definitely short term for them. All the money is in mobile games and their currently already heavily monetized retail version. There is no way for them to maintain the integrity of classic wow and monetize it anywhere worth  the dev time it would need. Mobile games are so much easier to develop and maintain and bring in so much more revenue.
---
This is the only way you get it. Some people were going to be OOTL and fucked over no matter how they did it.
---
If they announced it in advance, cue half a realm's disadvantaged population panic-transferring to get in under the wire, which would actually make the situation worse than leaving things be.
---
What makes the pocket population of hardcore players better than the majority of casual players? Both populations are paying for the product and the game is on a flat fee structure so you can't make the argument that whales deserve to be catered to because they are actually paying for the game like in a F2P model.
---
Love it mate, great job
---
People are not transferring because of the horde they are transferring because GRIZZLY is controlling horde/alliance and basically is running the server and gonna fuck up pvp.
---
Got from 57 to 59 yesterday just doing two or three scholo runs and an UBRS. Just gotta get solid groups and do the quests
---
/r/wow is a super old sub and there's probably at least a couple 100k people who once subbed to it and then never unsubbed while not browsing it or not even using that reddit account anymore.
---
Most subs reduce in member to online ratio over time, and /r/wow is no different. This is a terrible metric to use.
---
Im sure support can help revert that. Somebody should try and post results.
---
don't fucking silence this man
---
You never use flurry for offhand if you're not orc. Mirah's is better. Try to farm for crit stones, they add a lot to your DPS.
---
https://i.redd.it/kq2e92r9y3y31.png
---
Most players largely ignore lower level players on the road at the moment. With p2, I think a lot of people are going to be more tempted to quickly get that kill to inflate their honor kill count from now on. So you might die a bit more in your travels but that‚Äôs probably going to be the most extreme change.
---
How's mad so they downvote
---
LMAO.  Okay so let me get this straight:
---
You party up, work together cooperatively for 45 mins+, and an item in a video game drops. He then KICKS you to have it for himself, loses the Roll, and then curses you out?
---
LMAO please give me the name and server so I can blacklist.
---
"missclick lol" oldest trick in the book.
---
buddy... 
---
if you do it right this all happens in a split second, no one can react that fast. 
---
make a macro that puts pet on follow, feigns, traps.  just spam it and you'll get a trap off every time.  It's working identical to vanilla.
---
Puggle parsing pug posts is pretty practical
---
Imagine thinking those two groups contain all of the same people...
---
yup Puggle all the way :-)
---
Eww please leave and go back to your carebear server
---
Once again blizzard doesn‚Äôt have a fucking clue
---
What's the best metric? Blizzard won't release theirs since it would make retail look so bad.
---
This is pretty meaningless. All this really indicates is that the WoW subreddit has been around a long time and a lot of folks just never unsubscribed from it. Give Classic WoW 10 years and it will have a .5% active rate as well.
---
Whiny horde players... this literally made me laugh out loud. Anyone who spends 5 minutes on both of the wow subs can see its 85% alliance players bitching about one thing or the other. Watch this comment go down to -10 which will only prove my point.
---
I mean, if I'm getting shot through a tree or behind a mountain, then I think we're throwing realism out the window anyway.
---
wow that much?  I thought it would be somewhat like 2k.  but TBC is really long ago for me, I played plenty of vanilla in recent years but never on a tbc server since 2007
---
Yeah it goes through the game you're playing... IE not a third party program. There's nothing wrong with my logic at all.
---
Without enemy combat logs you can't have cast bars, you can't have the "what happened to me" pane of the combat log.  Both of those are far worse than Spy.
---
No, I'm stopping playing because I'm burnt out. Feeling like I'm falling behind current content is an extra thing on top of that. Stopping for now so I don't have that pressure feels like a weight off my shoulders. Potentially coming back down the line when I don't feel like I have to be playing constantly in the faint hope of experiencing content when it's current will be helpful.
---
Who gives a shit if he sucks? Let him play the game the way he wants to. Not everyone can be average or above average at the game.
---
Unbreakable was R14 with Hand of Rag and fucking clicked his abilities. You don't need to be good to get great gear and have fun.
---
Yeah makes me glad I picked a tank to play as. I'm generally protected from "fuck him, kick the guy" unless things go catastrophic
---
SLANDER LMFAO
---
Yes I posted this above.  Faction specific login queues will force server transfers.
---
Where the fuck you're coming from? I'm guessing one of the hundreds servers, where the ratio favours the Alliance? Because all other servers have it actually exactly opposite way.. at least based on my own experience
---
People wanted faction specific transfers, but right from the get-go. Not 30 minutes after half of their guild transferred off, and friends and family members are being split due to some being transferred off, and others not able to, without any warning from Blizzard. If it was going to be faction specific, Blizzard should have let everyone know, or at least warned people.
---
You tried to cover your names but his still shows. Rough.
---
Rofl my thought too
---
First of all, no they haven't. They never said multiboxing isn't automation or isn't botting. They only said they don't punish people for it. You're using faulty logic to come to an incorrect conclusion. Just because Blizzard doesn't punish for it doesn't mean it's not botting. What it means is that Blizzard is hypocrites, IE selectively enforces their own rules.
---
Why doesn't Garr explode his minions in classic? Is it a bug?
---
It‚Äôs not about e-peen, it‚Äôs about savoring salty bitch tears
---
That‚Äôs not the issue. It‚Äôs that they allowed some to go through before they shut it off. Now my irl friend group of 15 years is split 50/50.
---
Ima report you for being a little bitch
---
This is pretty neat-o
---
Holy shit lmao
---
Many people do that now as a passive way to level while doing nothing.its great when you want to level while watching Netflix
---
I justify in my head why certain things like hoofs and blood don't drop because there just wasn't anything salvagable left of said part after your pyroblast crit
---
Seems like bouncing out was the best move. 
---
Never seen that before.
---
Oh yes, the superior monologue.
---
It's Horde players whining about not having Alliance to kill on their realms. So yeah...  Whiny Horde players.  If you're a Horde player, you're simply proving my point. Thanks for that.
---
Turn back. this guy doesn't want the actual answer. 
---
he's an idiot who doesn't know how to use macros.
---
Prot isn't very good and completely unnecessary for dungeons and even most raids.
---
OOPSIE WOOPSIE!! Uwu We made a fucky wucky!! A wittle fucko boingo! The code monkeys at our headquarters are working VEWY HAWD to fix this!
---
People who are saying they got split up... that‚Äôs what you get for trying to flee from the PvP server **you chose to roll on** while exacerbating faction balance on two servers in the process.
---
Addons do guess buff durations as it is. They can see what is applied using spell name (and possibly rank, I can't remember) only.
---
What's broken is that you see these entries even if they are not freshly applied buffs.
---
You're so resistant to critical thinking. Societal values are informed by individual, daily, mundane, actions like these. Call out culture is not strictly political. You've given so little thought to what you've said that it's sad. I give up though. believe what makes you comfortable. Just remember that you make your own problems.
---
I figured they did it for collaborative reasons.   I really doubt the streamers care much about the rest of us.
---
I transferred from Noggenfogger to Judgement (my only choice) on the last day of transfers. Two days later transfers are open again and it‚Äôs possible to go from Noggenfogger to Earthshaker, where my IRL buddies were. 
---
I talked to a GM on the phone. Refused to do anything. Wouldn‚Äôt assist in transferring to Earthshaker or revert my transfer so I couls use the free transfer to Earthshaker from Noggenfogger again. 
---
This launch, the new realms and the transfers has all been botched repeatedly by Blizzard, and there is no way they will assist guilds locked on each of their realm now.
---
That's truee.  Just like double tapping a zombie
---
You mean the one I rolled on literally day one? 
---
You mean the literal only transfer option right now?
---
contrary to what you may think. Not all the horde enjoy being surrounded by other horde all the time.
---
Lol this is your own personal WoW hell. The last alliance on stalagg
---
Dont make a human for pvp lol. Nelf for BGs/wPvP and gnome/dwarf for duels 1v1s.
---
Sounds cool, I'll let you know how much I care when I can Vanish reliably.
---
Greedy trash human roleplays as gold slut goblin.
---
So you bounced out of getting a free xp ride?
---
Ever hear the phrase "two wrongs don't make a right"?
---
Think its more likely we'll get BGs midway through phase 2, with phase 3 being dedicated to BWL later on.
---
Yeah but leveling isn't my problem, I kinda wanted to run it for gear. Just seems wild to me.
---
What if it was true though? Would you still think that they should be punished/harassed for kicking OP?
---
Down voted then up voted, this post is an emotional rollercoaster.
---
Yeah it was my first time seeing something like that.
---
If a rogue stealths from mines to farm, then the add on won't be able to tell you where he is either.
---
I mean, there's no way you've finished all quests for all zones.
---
Depends on what you like. Blizzard or flamestrike/coc
---
Fuck you pushmybush
---
Yep, 100g per lotus and we're one of the most Horde-heavy servers out there. I'd assume it's even higher on the Alliance AH.
---
"The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Chung mountains.

---
While you are beating on her, I can Death Coil you. While you are beating on me, she will Seduce you.
---
I play alliance on stalagg and this was desperately needed. If the restriction got added sometime after transfers were enabled and people got split up then it's a big yikes.
---
It sounds like a PvE server would have been better for you.
---
Make your own group
---
wow blizz is fucking bad at this
---
or really good at it, if ruining classic is the goal
---
When I map Control + F1 to my mouse button #1, I click one button but two buttons are sent to the game.
---
This is done using Logitech's software.
---
Is this automation?
---
The issue isn't restricting by faction.
---
The issue is zero warning.  This needed warning and lead time, so guilds could decide as a whole whether go or tough it out.  Not get split by timing they didn't know about.
---
Wow, Grizzly, a single alliance guild controls the entire, and much more populous, enemy faction! Such babies, lol.
---
What is your guild doing? You dont need any consumables at all to do MC, the bosses are so simple its mind blowing. We have gone 4 full weeks without one single death and nobody brings consumables, same for onyxia, and we are far from being pros.
---
The on use for Second Wind is better than Royal seal for Mana unless the encounter lasts more than 6 minutes 15 seconds.
---
Royal Seal is still probably better because of the 11 healing, but I think it's closer than you let on.
---
Not really. They announced there would be transfers, and it opened as both factions. Hence there's two trains of thought to come out of that:
---
1) stay on current horde-dominated server only for alliance to transfer off, thus you are on an even more heavily horde-dominated server
---
2) transfer to Heartseeker despite the imbalance just to protect yourself from being on a server where alliance may be dead
---
~50g twink item.
---
The actual game should start at level 1 not max, something is fundamentally flawed here.  There is lots of ways to breath life into old content, lots of companies should start taking pointers from what runescape/jagex do.
---
Level up in brd.
---
Just don't zone out!
---
im rocking a Treant's Bane as orc 2H fury spec and I'm doing great on the meters. Our guild has had shitty shit shit luck for melee dps weapons from raids. No OBE, no BRE, no spinal, no earthshaker, 1 Deathrbinger, no brutality or viskag.
---
In which we wont even get that version. The 1.12 version doesn‚Äôt have the lotus
---
I was on your side until you admitted it was reserved. 
---
Maybe they should have talked to you, but you shouldn't have rolled at all either.
---
Was in a Gnomer pug a few weeks back and a blue BoE sword dropped.  A warrior rolled Need, everyone else chose Greed.  The second the guy won the roll, someone was telling him to equip it.  Didn't even give him a chance to do it on his own.  Then the guy said he hadn't trained swords yet, so he couldn't.  Accusations started flying, and I thought for sure the group was going to disband.  Then the linked his current weapon he was using, which was like a level 15 green.  The sword he just rolled Need on did more than twice the dps of his current weapon.  He said "If anybody things I'm going to sell that sword, you're a fucking idiot."  Luckily that put an end to it and we were able to finish.
---
This is horribly inaccurate and out of date for my realm.
---
Journeyman bags are also 14 slot and sell for less it's always confused me why people buy runecloth
---
Of course.
---
This PvP phase is going to be a huge mess and blizzard will rush out the battlegrounds ahead of schedule
---
I have to ask........ how do you get stuck on Garr? Not throwing shade, I‚Äôm genuinely curious what kind of shenanigans went down.
---
No. It means you can get hit with crits that one-shot you when they wouldn't do that to a warrior.
---
Get hand of Rag in classic you play SHAMAN not ELEMENTAL
---
Why block their name?  Tell us their name, alliance or horde, and what server.
---
Fuck them, name and shame.
---
/u/Horvla
---
Skrrt skrrt finna roll up on the other I'm sad that no one gives a shit if my dumb ass gets the flu in Vegas.
---
He doesn‚Äôt quite right with that boy.
---
I disagree. Most people are selling twink items for full price right now on my server, with a few exceptions (assault band for 10g, yes please, i have like 6 in my bank right now, waiting for the money to roll in in P3)
---
Anyone else disappointed with Slander's latest release. Wish they'd release more future bass.
---
Same concept :)
---
I mean he's right
---
&gt;If mages could use thunderfury they wouldnt
---
I definitely would.
---
But its WORTHLESS for my spec
---
How do you WoW fish and watch Netflix or work? Seems like you're still almost entirely just watching WoW lol
---
I dont use it but yes it seems like a game breaking add-on.
---
As a hunter you should want it gone too. It totally invalidates track humanoids and therefore puts us at a disadvantage.
---
It's called dramatic emphasis, you sound like fun at parties.
---
this is hilarious
---
Only the ZG one
---
Not counting style points here, pure usefullness in battle
---
Yea, I'm glad it doesn't do anything, that would completely overkill. Save the bans for when people actually do shit.
---
If you get hit by fire damage in combat, yeah.
---
I swear back in my WoW heydey in TBC/WOTLK, people didn't ninja as much as they do in classic. Wtf is going on?
---
It's actually pretty simple and I don't know pretty much anything about either language.
---
Chinese = Compact signs, usually very blocky. 
---
Japanese = More spacious signs.
---
Korean = Usually contains a lot of ovals.
---
Save it.  Once Phase 3 hits and BG's are out it will likely quadruple in price, at least.  Don't sell it now for a little gold - 20g is like 30m - 1h of farming.
---
&gt; really wanted to live in their mother's basement and shit in a sock.
---
Seriously getting so tired of this "I am very smart" try-hard mentality that a lot of lvl 60 players have in this game. Like we're all supposed to have the exact same free-time parameters and non-obligations of a teenager/college kid lol.
---
"Why aren't you seeing things and experiencing them exactly like I do? I don't understand it, are you not me?!?! How dare you!!"
---
While that's true of undead, it's not true of gnomes, at least not mages (and probably other casters).
---
Phase 2 has the potential to alienate players.  I only get 2-3 hours a week to play. I'm not goin to spend them hours which I always look forward to being ganked and camped.
---
If you are talking about the coordinates shown in the spy window. Those are YOUR coordinates whrn you spotted them
---
Hey man, just wanted to let you know that I leveled my warrior super fast within the first week or so following your guide through my web browser. It is truly great.
---
I'm just sad that people are porting your shit without considering the loss in revenue :(
---
Keep up the good work
---
Stv won't be used by the honor farmers 
---
They will be camping every flight path for in un goro, felwood, winterspring, wpl, epl, burning steps, and thorium point.
---
Menethil harbor will be over run with horde as well
---
What did he steal?
---
No zeps is the biggest downside.
---
thats frustrating as hell.
---
Stop wasting your money and wait until P3
---
Or the most lucky?
---
I believe it‚Äôs suppose to be chaotic. That‚Äôs the intention. The griefing not so much probably but they want you out there watching your back and being scared.
---
Your spec is worthless though. (lol. Outside of PvP at least.)
---
I‚Äôll have to your word for WD being r1 seeing as you haven‚Äôt provided any evidence. 
---
I also don‚Äôt see any possible way for WD to beat RM at top skill level. There isn‚Äôt enough resi in the game for Druids to survive the inevitable CC chain on the Warrior. Perhaps they were just good at dodging RMs.
---
Implying later raids won't get cleared in ridiculously low times? 
---
Yeah, nope. They will.
---
Style points are the only points that matter.
---
There's no point in being good at this game if you don't look cool doing it.
---
Give it a month.
---
Wow made in China quality :D
---
you got all the rights to be confused, and pissed off aswell, unlucky man
---
And people will berate you for having a life and not prioritizing this game over it. It's ridiculous.
---
Gotta stop to smell the flowers
---
Well this boy fucked up.
---
Thx for the spoilers in the title :/
---
Probably not in a guild to begin with and that's why that happened.
---
Burn your vanish so that you're useless once you actually start fighting? Sounds good.
---
If BG's were out we'd just have another set of problems.
---
Either way, I love that honor is being released separately, it will encourage world PvP for a few months until Battlegrounds come out, at which point a good amount of world PvP will die.
---
Two monitors on my desktop, listen for the splash and right click. Work on the laptop. Its tough but pays the bills :)
---
I need to fucking level fishing but whenever i remind myself to do it i feel bored just thinking about it.. any tips on how to get started?
---
I never leveled fishing.
---
I work 6 days, 50+ hours a week and I was able to hit 60 in the first month of classic. I‚Äôm full prebis and have a level 40 alt at the moment. I even took a week and a half off for vacation back in October. If you‚Äôre actually focusing on leveling to hit 60, you should probs be close by now.
---
So it should stay that way even tho there are people out there enjoying it?
---
Seems like an apt response to someone who doesn't think being good at the game lets you level faster.
---
When I was questing in Arathi Highlands this Skull rogue would sneak up, sap me, kill my pet, and leave.
---
The worst.
---
Hilarious though.
---
Just get out there and do it. Its relaxing
---
It's almost like different people have different opinions.
---
I think it still would be chaotic. You would still be worth honor so wpvp would drastically increase, it would just give min/maxers a different way to get their honor.
---
Will the battleground rewards be included with Phase 2 PvP? Like the WSG marks? Wondering whether or not the low level blues will be available soon. I'm not talking about the PvP rank rewards. I've been googling and can't find a good answer.
---
That's a strange way to say Alt+F4
---
Any laptop, really. I paid around 300 for mine 4 years ago and it runs it just fine
---
Always lovely lol At least folks will have some sort of heads up (if they read comments lol)
---
More technically, it‚Äôs only libel if it wasn‚Äôt factually true (idk if it was, just having fun here).
---
The way I see it, resilience is a cop out for being unable to balance pvp and pve numbers. 
---
It objectively isolates the pools of loot for pvp vs pve, which fragments the player base and nullifies cross-interaction between pve and pvp. 
---
In vanilla/classic, the best gear in the game is earned through PvE. 
---
This creates a more heterogenous pvp community because some people are Uber geared from pve but suck at pvp yet are still able to have fun, some people are not geared at all but dominate at pvp because they‚Äôre good at their class, and everything in between. 
---
Also pve gear being good for pvp means raid zones are hotly contested world pvp areas because denying the opposing faction from gearing easily becomes an objective that brings benefits in pvp. 
---
Resilience and pvp gear created a more straightforward progression and made it so pve players had no chance in pvp without going through the pvp grind and players who wanted to dabble in pvp but mostly played pve would get crushed. There‚Äôs no feedback loop between pvp and pve.
---
Then its not the type of run for you.
---
I believe that only works for retail.
---
You didnt know what you were getting into when you rolled on Classic?
---
Yea i stopped playing already just waiting for P3 so theres somthing actually fun to do other then pve grinding
---
That play style is still valid.  It‚Äôs just gonna be a little harder on pvp servers since people have an incentive to kill you.  Your world is not going to grind to a halt just like dire maul early release did not turn the economy on its head.  
---
My issue is that the stop and smell the roses crowd seems to be demanding that they are entitled to the same experience as people who are more focused on end game content.  How can you legitimately expect that?
---
no it doesn't. i can do exactly what the video shows. 
---
you're not using a macro to pull your pet back, feign, and trap.  bottom line.
---
Yeah, this level of wPvP will probably never happen again in the life of classic.  Enjoy it, take a bit of a break, level some alts, or just endure.  Once it‚Äôs over, it‚Äôs over.
---
I play on an xps13 and it gets hot but it's fine. Also use a external GPU and it's great
---
I dont think this is a bug,  but it's a good tip. I have one macro where the tooltip wasnt working, and I didnt notice the case difference. It had been driving me crazy
---
Well shadow priest is the best pvp spec in the game so if you like winning..
---
Right, but you still have to feed the damn thing every time it dies. If each food is 10s (depends on the pet, but not unreasonable at max level), that can add up.
---
Also, if you can get a second fight with the hunter when their pet is not happy, the pet doesn't do as much damage. I seem to remember it going like happy 125% damage, neutral 100% damage, unhappy 75% damage, so it's a pretty big damage nerf if it's not happy.
---
Love it
---
Ja ass√• alla e v√§l 40+ √•tminstonde, kanske de som e saken. Adda mig ingame o boosta mig genom bfd annars b. Hade varit schysst somfan.
---
says the guy that can feign/trap in pvp just like in vanilla.  we used a macro back then, and we use one now.
---
I knew very well and did it, and would do it again
---
Ashkhandi is the one BWL two hander that might compare to hand of ragnaros, but its not considerably better, and is likely worse since hand of rag's proc rate is pretty dam good.  
---
" Sure, it's good now. But when BWL rolls out, I'd take any 2h from there over HoR. "  
---
This was OP's post, remember.
---
Watching people's hands was never a thing, not in classic, not ever. Enemy cast bars used by all serious pvp'ers because it's an integral part of the game. There is no watering down the quality or lowering the skill ceiling by having it in the game.
---
As a warrior, swiftness potions are your friend. Fear + Zoom away until you can mount up. Sometimes I'll Fear, intercept a mob, then pop swiftness to run for that extra bit of distance
---
Yeah, that sounds awful. If my server was like that, I would just stop playing.
---
But doesn't Heartseeker have the same problem, except worse and in reverse?
---
Doesnt sound like your guild is active enough then. Make sure when you get to 60 you pay it forward and come help people getting ganked
---
Can make your own sappers, can reload mortar.
---
Also what level should I star worrying about plate armor? Just in case I have to tank
---
Ain't that the truth - who really cares, like meh.
---
No, you should complain on reddit until you get what you want
---
That's because there is a huge demographic who played vanilla back in the day when they didn't have responsibilities. Now they do have them and when these stories are shared, it's like reminiscing about good times with others who are at the same point in life. If you don't care, move along.
---
Oh and by the way, my first kid came 3 days before the release of classic. Just got my first 40 mount! :P
---
How did they botch it though, you chose to transfer to Judgement, and then decided this was a bad choice when new information came available.  You're just blaming Blizzard for not helping correct a choice you made poorly which they clearly state they won't do.
---
Blizzard is such idiots, they literally changed their transfers after reading a post on reddit. No thoughtful consideration about the impact it would have on locked faction players, or what would happen to the players who were transferring as a group. They are laughably incompetent.
---
I play alliance on the streamer server and literally have not had any issues with anything streamer related. Full clear MC and Ony every week, server feels fun and balanced, always can find groups at all hours.
---
 I'd take that any day over an unbalanced lower pop server that struggles to form groups during off time hours.
---
Phase 2 is going to be the best phase of classic wow
---
Battlegrounds make the world feel empty
---
Miks scrolling battle text shows procs that most other add-ons don't. I use it to track my extra energy gained and sword specialisation, thrash procs too. No other add-on would track thrash procs.
---
This one is a legitimate thing to complain about.  They allowed unrestricted transfers at first, so many guilds half transfered before the restrictions went in, and are split up again.
---
If you send me a PM i'd be more then happy to. Or add me on discord for further talk
---
Bra#8337
---
Very clearly it's one of the centuar from Barrens
---
I just do it cuz I'm melee, and the number of hunters who think they're just going to kite me while the pet attacks me is stupid high. I'm going to kill your kitty.
---
Ah yeah, if you're under level 40 use mail for survivability.
---
When you hit 40, you'll want to acquire some plate pieces so that your damage mitigation takes a significant bump.
---
Auctionator already has vendor price built in - having it and vendorprice shows the vendor price twice on the tooltips.
---
lol, never been called an elitist for suggesting someone should do their class quest...
---
Currently have tailoring enchanting on my warlock but I'm thinking about dropping enchanting and switching to engineering for PvP. Is there any need for enchanting since I can most likely get everything from someone else?
---
That's what's known as a vendor fish lol it's like a Rainbowscale something or another. It's the more common catch in wetlands
---
Weird all of my guild and other guilds we play with don't find the game unplayable at all... Maybe find some people to play with?
---
2 completely separate games.
---
&gt; Undead mage starts casting Pyroblast
---
But oh no, you aren‚Äôt hostile, so you never see it coming.
---
Yeah, no thanks. Your fix is to simply ‚Äúnerf‚Äù the combat log. This is a punishment for people who don‚Äôt use the addon but use the old school ‚Äúcombat log‚Äù  in a seperate window.
---
Yeah, arcanite reaper wasn't available for alliance as well. I'm not sure what happened there.
---
It was carefully considered tbh, we knew that the majority of ally pop would transfer, further decimating the ally population. So instead of being the poor sods left holding the bag, we decided to go too. I'm not saying it's morally right, but it's a pragmatic choice.
---
What actual facts make you think "most" people aren't 60? Is it because you're not 60 and can't imagine it?
---
I ran my 2nd MC last night, with alts of the guild I ran with.  Alts.
---
Those streamers etc are on their 3rd 60s, regular 9-5 working people could very easily be 60 by now. So unless you have extremely limited time to play, or you just want to take it slow, there's no way "most" people aren't 60 already.
---
Troll post?
---
Join a guild that has parse requirements
---
Since nonone can wear plate until 40, you won't be able to find any until then. If you want, keep a plate set for tanking, but it shouldnt be a huge issue to tank in mail for a while.
---
Upvoted as this is the next profession I will probably do lol
---
TIL 3 days of /played time can only be accumulated in hyper long gaming sessions the likes of which only either young kids or stay at home losers can achieve. Nope totally can't achieve a 3 day /played level 60 by spending an hour or two a night playing while living a balanced and normal life.
---
Starting wearing plate when you can (level 40). It will reduce the amount of damage you take a lot more than mail and will let you kill things longer before eating
---
Damn, this is accurate.
---
I should have just grinded up my rogue to 60, but no.  Had to make alts instead....
---
"if you can't complete the quests, then you're not capable at your class... so why are you playing?
---
to suck?"
---
Lol, way to sound like one - who really cares man. Those demons ain't the easiest, and if I can get help, I will.
---
I get it, I'm an adult now too,  but it's seriously not that big of a time investment (you're already 60 and raiding...), and you get way better at your class which translates to more fun imo.  but you do you.
---
What I tend to do, is look for guild adverts that appeal to me or have the same goals as I do.
---
Then after joining the guild, I spend a couple of weeks in it. If in let's say a month I feel like it isn't a good fit then I just leave to find another.
---
There isn't some magical way to weed them out. Just have to join and see if they mesh with your personality and play style. If not then just message an office explaining your leaving and leave(Not necessarily needed but is always nice). Many guilds have an intro rank for that same reason, to see if the player is a good fit in the guild as well.
---
yeah, so either combine the 2 server pops or just let all the alliance go to one and all the horde go to the other and let the pvp die but at least everyone could enjoy the game. I think playing as the 100% faction would be better than the 10% faction.
---
and i basically have stopped playing, I got like 1-40 in the first couple weeks and have gotten 10 levels now over like 1.5 months.
---
Lol I know, these kids are ridiculous.
---
You're an amazing dungeon tank all the way to and including lvl 60. All you really need is consecrate and later on improved RF. At 60 with decent gear you can still tank all dungeons as holy as long as you squeeze the 3 points for RF into your build.
---
In theory you can tank most p1 raid bosses too, but it's really only for the memes and a warrior or druid will always be better.
---
Oh sorry to hear it was missing - that seems like they should have helped you then. I mean it‚Äôs soup bound so you couldn‚Äôt have sold it or something like that.
---
Cool.
---
Did you mean to respond to me?
---
They are seriously incompetent, the dumbasses changed their policy based on a single reddit post without considering how it would impact players on the locked factions. They deserve to lose subscriptions over this.
---
Same thing happened on Skeram, Onslaught controlled the AH on horde side and made it impossible for alliance to do any devilsaur. Even as horde if you managed to snag one they would rush to ninja the skin. They had the server first Lionheart Helm and would not allow anyone to use mats to craft and were slowly selling it off to keep arcanite bar prices low. They wanted 1200 gold their mats no option to use your mats.
---
Low Pop Pvp is a good compromise. Still occasional fights but you can go for an hour without seeing someone at times
---
I know this is hyperbolic, but these comments can‚Äôt help me but think about when Iron Curtain was raised in Europe and Berlin.
---
I would say classic raiding is about on par with lfr difficulty: if you pug it you can probably kill everything with 40 randoms but you might have some deaths and if you go in with a group of people you know you‚Äôll smash it to pieces
---
Some people would pay good money to watch that.
---
It's ok, apostrophes are hard.
---
That's the hope, were you pool hunting or just static and persistent?
---
Everyone asks for faction based transfers to help imbalance.
---
Blizzard does faction based transfers.
---
Same players now whine they did faction based transfers.
---
Love this sub.
---
Make one mistake=fired
---
Yeah because *only* the overpopped servers crashing have ***nothing*** to do with being overpopped. Ok, scrub.
---
Imagine being this clueless
---
Well see there you go guys.

All that thing from last week can *just calm down*.
---
Human.
---
Blizz should undo the Alliance transfers and lock the transfers for Horde only.
---
All your money? That's worth 20g on my server xD

Hi, /u/AnnoyingTV

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/duytvp/faerlina_down_again/). 
---
I know I shouldn't assume, and I apologize for that. I've calmed down a bit, but it just baffles me that the plan was to open transfers for everyone for a few minutes then restrict to faction specific splitting guilds and friends apart. 
---
Again, I'm sorry if I came across as douchey.
---
Thank you blizzard. Saved this server from being completely alliance free. 
---
Open transfers made no sense anyways, stalaag isn't layered and doesn't have queues. This benefits everyone on the server.
---
Kromcrush. Tbh, it wasn't terrible leading up to Un'goro, but that was in zones like Tanaris (which was bad right around Gadgetzan, but chilled farther afield), Hinterlands and Feralas. Moving servers is an option, but I'd prefer not to deal with the headache of dealing bank alts, etc that I've got a lot of assets tied up in. 
---
I'm probably just gonna push hard the next few days, try to stay off during peak hours after that, and I'm out of town during Thanksgiving week, so all told I think I can somewhat manage through the initial honor rush - assuming it's only a couple weeks. If not I'll just put the brakes on my main until after Turkey day.
---
Glad you're finding good use for it! Updates to the guide are done live so any feedback you leave will be incorporated quickly. Enjoy the leveling experience!
---
That is like 18 months away. Even a 200% increase is not much per month then.

Static on the dhingy right off the dock in Wetlands. Had to vendor twice due to the Rainbow fish to make more space. Started at like 7 this morning and stopped around 3.

Over 500 days on retail.

But already over 31 in Classic.

Survival gets viable with a lot of agi..so around naxx. Its not a melee spec

Right, because not respecting 39 other peoples time isn't borderline griefing and selfish.
---
If everyone ran unoptimized specs you'll be killing rag in 3 hours instead of 1-2 hours.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. I'm just saying that this survey is absolutely not indicative of the average player. It would have to be issued in game to have any sort of accurate result for the overall playerbase.

Isn't that just regular caster gear ? You could just roll on the mage/warlock loot.

Someone mentioning ‚Äúclassic+‚Äù is an instant LOL for me.

Nah, but a lot of people care about parses and server rankings.
---
Oops, no. Sorry

I'd also like to now point out that this has happened again with  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/dubnkw/ran\_into\_nixxiom\_at\_the\_renaissance\_festival/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/dubnkw/ran_into_nixxiom_at_the_renaissance_festival/) unless i'm failing to see it there's no moderator comment as to why this was locked
---
Related question. Is robe of the void worth dropping herbalism, power leveling tailoring and then re-leveling herbalism? Was thinking of just getting robe of winter night instead of going through the above headache.
---
I mean according to Iron forge (which scrubs data from raiding logs, so only active raiders are counted) stalagg is 2:1 horde:ally. This is only 60s who raid, but that balance isn't completely awful.
---
BRD arena AF is not very good for XP. If you change your focus to questing or some full runs of Strat or scolo working twords your pre BiS I think you‚Äôll find yourself leveling faster.
---
Tell that to the angry bunch that were just here last week, calling Blizzard all kinds of childish names because they wouldn't encourage server transfers based on faction.
---
Here we are today and we're saying oh they're incompetent because they're kowtowing to the customer. Can't win.
---
We have a lot of try hard horde on incendius. They camp alot of flight masters in low level zones
---
What faction?  Anathema is ally favored, but it doesn‚Äôt seem that imbalanced, just slightly ally favored.
---
A bunch sounds about right.
---

---
my naga
---
Ya I understand that. I made it a point to get to 60 before world pvp started because there‚Äôs no way I wanted to be caught out in plaguelands or winterspring at level 55ish having to fight for everything for some XP lol
---
I raid as arms warrior because I want to pvp mainly, it‚Äôs selfish I know but my raid allows me to which is the most important part.
---
Aside from that, I use bonereavers edge which is why my damage output is top damage done a lot of the time during MC raid.
---
I‚Äôm 2h arms warrior, I use mortal strike, and I do top damage on multiple bosses.
---
Edit: if you don‚Äôt believe me check my raid logs
---
They didnt break anything, the authors of the addon changed it themselves
---
&gt; No one said MC would be hard, if they did they are an idiot.
---
Have you been on /r/classicwow in the last year?
---
Yeah, if your healing gear is decent you can heal in shadow spec without much trouble. My wife healed LBRS last night specced 37 shadow 14 disc.
---
At 57 I had all the eastern plague lands and a bunch of winterspring quests still to do. I didn't really do the BRD grind but I started strath at 58.
---
Eating a fallen foe is the ultimate disrespect.
---
Good stuff.
---
Add a raid target to them, done.
---
Yeah that's how I leveled my paladin.  Judge crusader, cast seal of righteousness and alt-tab out for 30s until righteousness dropped.  Recast it and repeat.
---
It was open water fyi.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm kicking myself for ditching my warlock for my priest because I wanted to ‚Äúsupport my guildies‚Äù and ‚Äúbe a good person‚Äù instead of incinerating my enemies with hellfire.
---
I‚Äôm a rogue who is very into PvP, and I think it‚Äôs fine. Other people with Spy would already be able to see me if I was in range of it anyway, and since I‚Äôm a rogue it‚Äôs inevitable that I‚Äôm going into stealth. It really doesn‚Äôt make a difference at all what class you‚Äôre playing
---
Luckily lionheart helm is completely unnecessary item phase 1 so everyone just waited for another guild to get the recipe, right?
---
Specific DDoSing of faerlina??
---
Not on a non-pvp server. 
---
Horde: (walking and minding the business) 
---
Alliance: (passing by riding a horse wearing table cloth) [target: horde] /rude
---
Especially long escort quests.
---
Wetlands or westfall ?
---
That‚Äôs still an extremely limited time frame to give a reasonable consideration of whether or not it will have longevity
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/lightshope/comments/7o50fq/is_there_an_average_played_time_to_get_to_60_in/
---
Everything I've read has had a minimum of about eight days as the fastest someone who isn't using a guide but is using a wrist soon and is leveling professions can do, and the average is much slower.  Your numbers are very blatantly skewed in favour of power gamers like yourself who rush like madmen to level cap.
---
Nobody else in your raid enjoys it. You're taking loot from classes that do your job better and are playing roles that are considerate of everyone's time and effort. There's 39 other people in the raid and some of them are putting in extra effort to be the most useful they can be. Are you more helpful to a raid than a resto shaman or a mage?
---
More than likely unless they allow those people to revert the transfer. We were kinda hype to move to a higher pop server and now that‚Äôs a dead hope.
---
Ah. I remember some rainbow something that I‚Äôd get in azshara. I would always throw them away to make room for  my daily catch of squid and all the alch fishies.
---
Guess you shouldn't have rolled on a PVP server then?
---
Seriously, how long do you want blizz to wait? There will always be people saying its TOO SOON!
---
Is there any way to cheese DM Tribute runs? Like to skip any of the bosses and not use the mats? I was in a group with someone who said you could skip some stuff but didn't clarify. I learned the recipe for the ogre suit so I'm wondering mainly if there's a way to pass by slip'kik.
---
Yes but buddy blocks most others as well. It will auto equip your weapon again if your jumped too.
---
You don't lose durability from fighting players. That's why a lot of griefers will try to mind control you off a cliff or get a mob to kill you so that you not only die but also have to pay a repair bill

Wiping is fun when the content is hard.
---
Trust me, wiping in MC isn't fun - explicitly because it's so easy.
---
I had pugged it ~6 weeks ago or so and we went 8/10 one shotting it. When my (then) guild finally got to it, 2 weeks later, we wiped on Baron 6 times. That shit ain't fun.
---
It's fantastic that they listened but this will cause some problems on certain servers for those simply wishing to escape queues. We'll have to see after tomorrow how bad the queues will get.
---
For example on Herod alliance can't leave period... and Horde have the choice of going to Arcanite (dead) or Heartseeker (90% alliance dominated, you'd have to be a masochist to set foot there as horde).
---
But the choices for most servers look good and it's a great (and surprising to be honest) step for Blizz
---
This is a great step by why isn‚Äôt whitemane horde only. The ratio is 37.??% alliance and 63.??% horde.
---
Come Thursday when pvp starts it will throw that number down to 30-70 probably
---
we were ripping dads VHS collection at the time...
---
And yet servers crashing was never warned by blizzard, which was the point you were trying to push this whole time. Sit down.
---
And way more alliance than horde on heartseeker, leading to the limitation placed by blizzard on transfers
---
Pally tank here. You can tank dungeons fine and I haven't ever been discriminated against. Realistically it's possible for you to raid tank most bosses but in most cases a paladin is far from an optimal choice for raids.
---
I'll have to check that out
---
I'm on Deviate Delight, just a little bigger than you according to the site that was linked. Honestly I like it on the small pop side. Forming pugs can take a bit, but I get around that with a good guild. There are 7-8 guilds in alliance that have cleared both raids, and two active raiding pugs. The economy isn't inflated by hundreds of farmers. It's cozy.
---
It doesn't do the same thing. That's how it's logical.
---
The logical comparison would be 5 computers with 5 keyboards (inputs) and one person playing all of them. That's fine.
---
Why don't you think people do that? This is a rhetorical question the answer is because automation makes it viable. One person trying to play 5 accounts isnt efficient or really even possible without the 3rd party program automating it.
---
Oh here we go again...
---
Thank you Blizzard üòä
---
It‚Äôs easier in dungeons with runners like live side and brd. Scholo more easily than strat ud imo.
---
I understand your point but you guys missed the opportunity to just convert your guides into an addon in the first place? People really tab in and out of a browser for a leveling guide when there are many in-game guides already available?
---
How is it not game breaking? lol
---
You have an absolutely MASSIVE advantage over people who dont have the addon.
---
I'd probably avoid prot as it'll make solo leveling hell if you can't find a group or wanna take a break from dungeons for a while. I think you can pretty easily tank raids up to high 50s without going heavy into prot. Then you could respec at high 50s and start healing higher level dungeons and starting to get some BiS gear from the dungeons to prep for raid healing.
---
Man they have this playlist called heaven trap on their SoundCloud. That playlist is so good I wished they did more remixes or original songs .
---
Enjoyed watching this. Ignore the salty twats in here.
---
Nah. Server population is 12x bigger than classic but the spawns are the same. The ratio isn't blizz-like. :\^)
---
Here's what Kaivax had to say:
---
&gt;I‚Äôve updated the original post here.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Free Character Moves from Fairbanks, Herod, Incendius, Kromcrush, Skeram, and Stalagg are only available to Horde characters.  
---
&gt;We had some unexpected technical issues when we first enabled this service a couple of hours ago, and we‚Äôve been working through those.

---
In other words, some buggy code got into the production environment and they expect customers to just deal with it???
---
I'm not affected by it (I'm on a medium-pop PvE server), but if they don't fix this for you they'll be looking very unprofessional.
---
If has to do with how it is shared. Text-based distribution is libel, broadcast distribution is slander.
---
Both can be referred to as defamation - and the fact that the information shared is true is an absolute defense against defamation so this isn't a case of either libel or slander.
---
I recommend shadowform and runecloth bandages for a decent challenge.
---
Is there a hearth in plaguelands? If so, where?
---
lol @ blizz's pace I bet Phase 3 will be out in a week.
---
Don't need to just need to create an addon that bolds or highlights if some one stealths. You can also create filters pretty easily.
---
Unless you can get a good, dedicated group, I'd skip most dungeons for this bracket.  Doing a dungeon quickly turns into waiting around for people for hours only to get someone that needs to drop group and wait for the next dude that decided to LFG for BRD in Winterspring and you either have to wait 20 min for him to get there, or try and progress with 4 people while wiping one or two times and needing to leave to repair...then getting ganked by the opposite faction for another 10 minutes.
---
Then you shake your head and go, if I had just spent the last hour leveling out in the world I would have been 57 by now.  I had TOO many quests from level 50-60.  There is no shortage and you can easily get to max level by yourself without needing to waste time in dungeons with crappy players.
---
Even after hitting 60, I just finished the first 3 Tirion Fordring quests in EPL and barely did 2 quests in Winterspring.  That's pretty much all I did in those zones.
---
This depends on what you mean by ok.
---
Can Arms do enough to take to a raid and still clear it?  Yes.
---
Will you behind any other similarly geared/skilled warrior and most other dps?  Yes.
---
There is a lot of stuff you CAN do in vanilla raiding, especially MC.  Most of the wonky stuff will still bosses because it's easy to carry 15ish people in a 40 man raid.  The question for you is this, are you ok with being one of the worst performing people in the raid?
---
Yeah sounds about right.
---
There were open transfers available for how long? If you didn't take it then, thats your choice. You still have a way off, reroll. Blizzard has no obligations to offer free transfers just because you don't like your server, especially since free transfers would just make the situation worse for both stalaag and the target server.
---
I feel like people the people that rushed to 60 are a whole different pop from the casual crowd though. I was thinking that if I just rushed 60 with everyone I wouldn‚Äôt have many problems now, but I didn‚Äôt and leveling is less fun than other servers.
---
you can farm maraudon for a level or two until you get a few upgrades (including the bis ring), badlands, ungoro is amazing for warrior questing (just pick up everything and kill everything), azshara, winterspring it's all good, mid 50's you can farm brd, last 2 levels i would hit up plaguelands, all the kill quests are solid and effortless and you can easily join scholo runs
---
Because for *huge* parts of the game the ‚Äúyou think you want it but you don‚Äôt‚Äù statements were 100% accurate. And I mean I guess that‚Äôs fine, there‚Äôs certainly a list of things in classic I think should be changed myself. 
---
I do dislike add ons that end up ruining a lot of the fun and cool stuff that we used to do... in vanilla I formed a raid of 40 rogues and druids and we stealthed in to ogrimmar, our presence first announced by the sudden and violent death of Thrall. Would suck for the entire city to know we were there because an add on did the work for someone.
---
I don‚Äôt see it going anywhere though unless they drop stealth events from the combat log for those that aren‚Äôt close enough to see you.
---
The lady doth protest too much, methinks
---
I about 1 shot a 60 last night with my perds ambush, so I'd say pretty big.
---
great thanks, gonna try it out !
---
About the only thing that makes gold from engineering is the bombs. Sapper charges sell the best, and those can only be crafted by a goblin engineer.
---
it's all in the execution, if they announced it from the start it was horde only then itd be okay but the shit show now is still a shit show even if the reason for it is because they acted to listen to the customers
---
Truthfully don‚Äôt even need that. I get 30ish FPS on my surface pro 2 with integrated graphics. Lowest setting of course but it works well enough.
---
Best of luck dude!
---
One of my guild's higher ups finally hit 52 and he's had a fuckton of school stuff to do so he can barely play, i seriously wonder what these people are doing if he's further along than some of the people complaining.
---
And he's leveling a warrior so its even slower.
---
You were asking a bunch of headass questions, you don't really deserve a good response.
---
We need a discord to work out times we can drop it without overlapping, like the ony head realm discord coordination.
---
they probably will have faction specific queues. At least that would make the most sense. shit, this probably means those won't happen...
---
We might all be terrible. My rogue's name is "gankingjerk."
---
Only makes sense if they do faction specific queues.
---
Otherwise alliance is complete fucked, can't transfer, can't get through queue because horde won't transfer, and can't move because horde is grinding 'honor" 24x7
---
Did garr last night with seven warlocks. Cleanest kill ever. Then got to domo with one mage, couldn't clear.
---
Do you also deal with the dominant Alliance guild actively colluding with the horde in PVP? Because if you haven't had the fun of living with that then its really a different situation entirely.
---
Thank you so much for sharing this! I have weakauras installed but not yet set up. I‚Äôm going to do something similar to this with my casters because I love this layout. Cheers!
---
I can see that but you can also just ignore and even hide posts you don't care about right? There's the wow forums as well although I've not been there so I don't know what the state of it is.
---
If these posts get enough upvotes, it just goes to show that there are a lot of people that like seeing these types of posts. For every post with similar content, I see these same comments as well. The circle of life I guess...
---
Since you are resto, my advice is to find a raiding guild now.  Make sure they know you aren't attuned yet in the interview.  Then once invited, odds are you'll have plenty of folks willing to do an attunement run and help with all the mobs.  With BRD, you can't count on a pug wanting to do attunement as there aren't any good drops that direction.
---
Also, the attunement chain for Onyxia is a fair chunk of XP too.
---
I'll take a vid when i get home from work.  You exited combat successfully for long enough to cast trap at the end of the video. 
---
the point of the macro is that it will allow you to do things faster than a human can react.   
---
I get home in like 2 hours, then i'll download obs or something so i can do a quick recording. I use that macro (I call it "OH SHIT!") constantly.   don't even need to scatter first.
---
as for why your dude casts feign then it takes a full fuckin 2-3 seconds to actually drop combat. IDK man, that doesn't happen to me.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Then they gave Alliance everyone for himself in Wotlk and everyone doing pvp went Alliance again and afaik it's been Alliance heavy ever since.
---
I see that Saurfang is still unkillable
---
Tank item going to a dps over the tank. 
---
The dps has already won a bit of gear that raid and the tank had his roll disregarded on other loot as it was dps prio. 
---
He just gquit on the spot. 
---
So good. 
---
He is an irl mate and we still joke about it. Myself and about 10 others left shortly after to find a new place with him. 
---
Currently not much drama in the new guild.
---
You need to show me your VCR to Gif conversion software. I did not know that was possible.
---
So what you're telling me is that I need to block my hot bars next time I post something here?  The're set up that way because that's the way I like it.
---
Yeah, probably. Mining seems like most of the money comes from getting lucky with arcane crystals. Herbing will always make money because people need potions every week.
---
If you use details!, you can look into the buffs you have acquired while fighting and it has a button to make a weakaura for it. I would suggest doing that for the procs.
---
TrinketMenu for Trinkets and Itemswap+bartender for easy swap of other items.
---
The what happened pane would be fine as it would log the event as it happened to you.
---
Cast bars would be interesting as those aren‚Äôt supported in WoW classic, players just made add ons that guess based on combat logs and known spells.
---
As a Hunter I have 0% issue when I feign death to drop combat. 
---
My macro is:
---
#Showtooltip Feign Death
---
/petstay
---
/cast Feign Death
---
Then I drop my trap and then I sick my pet on my target or make him re follow me.
---
Sure, friend.
---
Did he charge you for it? Did said content charge you for it? Both of the answers is no. Who fucking cares. I‚Äôm sorry but you put info out for free it‚Äôs gonna get used how people like.
---
Maybe classicwow.live should have done this theirselves? This isn‚Äôt when wow first launched. People don‚Äôt want to have two monitors just to read what quest to do next when addons do just that inside of wow.
---
That 10-20% alliance on skeram are fkd now. 
---
I liked faction based xfers but they had to be in from the beginning.
---
Oh, sorry, by higher you meant slower? I took spawn rates being high to mean they spawned faster.
---
It's not that they dont have blood, just that your bad at collecting a good sample.
---
They need to just release paid transfer already
---
Ahah good luck ganking anything with vanish on cooldown
---
What? Obviously spell cast range should be way inside the combat log range.
---
Why wouldn't you see it coming? I'm talking about reducing the range for combat log entries by pvp flagged players, leaving other combat log entries as they are now.
---
Casuals are not interested in this ancient game, people might have obligations but theyre not "casuals" or at least, anyone trying to play this game casually would have burnt out by now.
---
&gt; SP doesnt bring any utility.
---
- Defensive dispell
---
- Offensive dispell
---
- AE fear
---
- Fear ward for Alliance
---
- Shields
---
Please, don't talk about subjects you know zero about.
---
&gt;a) cannot keep up when people start getting gear (bwl+)
---
See above. Don't talk stuff you don't know.
---
&gt;b) dont have a role in premades.
---
Bullshit. Again, you just know zero about SP.
---
Same here
---
Doesn't seem weird at all. It would just create a cascading imbalance of horde/ally that would continue forever?
---
Alliance get frustrated with imbalance, transfer off server creating even more imbalance.
---
If only horde can do it then it evens up.
---
Edit: it's make even more sense if it also included a faction change.
---
Exactly my thought process.  
---
The ONE solution to their problem and basically the problem they have created is to have faction queues....  
---
But it makes to much sense for them to do it. Then again they just went and did faction specific transfers only so we might be surprised! Basically you can't go and say that hey if you dont want a Q we highly suggest you transfer, then not give you the opportunity to transfer. At this point they either gotta open it up to both or do faction specific queues.   
---
As a player on herod alliance I personally like being out numbered, maybe not by this much. Last night on my alt I got farmed for 30 mins running from thorium point to BRD, the horde are starting to get thirsty there and at lights hope. It'll be a blood bath once we actually get some raid groups going because I haven't seen any horde do anything good other than just the 5v2's and still lose.
---
Yeah, unfortunately most people avoid all challenges.
---
Literally anyone who‚Äôs ever had a single PUG group can tell you that /played does not correlate with competence whatsoever.
---
The anti-circlejerk on this sub about how every person who hasn‚Äôt spent their life in front of a computer for the past 2 months isn‚Äôt good at the game is getting even worse than the ‚Äútake your time‚Äù original jerk
---
I expect price to go up, as low/medium/high servers will for sure get more players. Also p2 soon, so people will be more out in the open world hunting for kills and it will be more difficult to get your hands on these.  
---
Also some guilds might use flasks for the open world fights
---
I love my medium pop server.
---
Maybe go back to retail? You obviously have no clue of how things worked. Did you watch a private server guide instead of actually playing back in the day?
---
1g per stack on my server...
---
I did BRD from 55-60. From the 58-59 range it was just 4 bars per full run but that was decent.
---
So the Horde end up winning, yes? I liked that story, tell another.
---
My entire guild was in the middle of a transfer. Then this was announced (after some people already transferred, including my RL friends) and now we are not transferring / can't anymore.
---
I will be beyond upset if they don't allow them to come back.
---
Thanks for your comments. I will look into it :)
---
Well, as a Heartseeker denizen, I can say it's not packs of 5 alliance combing the hills for horde and camping them until they log.  It's definitely more favored to alliance but not to the point of any moving horde is instantly dead.  It's easier to heal someone at 1 hp than someone who died after all.
---
I'm sure there will be plenty of people out ganking lowbies, whether they give honor or not.  The reality is those ganks are going to be largely unrelated to the honor system as a whole.  The honor gained by a 60 for killing someone under like 57 is incredibly minor.  People will kill lowbies because they always have.  It may even go up some, but it will because they are assholes not because they are doing it for honor.
---
The likely situations is being trying to start TM/SS wars or guild talking to each other to organize times to go out and have some battles.  The idea of roving gank squads scouring searing gorge is exaggerated.
---
Water go down the hole!
---
Faction specific queues would be the next logical step.  That will get some horde guilds to start transferring.
---
Keep in mind that the actual percentage is likely much much higher. These numbers represent the people in this sub, not all the subscribers playing classic wow. If you‚Äôre in this sub, you‚Äôre skewing more hardcore than most of the player base.
---
And hunters can chunk the majority of clothies HP or even oneshot them in wPvP or BGs out of anyones range, behind a frontline, completely safe, whilst rogues are squishy and can't just willy nilly enter a teamfight. If you want all classes to be able to duel at a high level and be homogeneous, maybe classic isn't for you, buddy.
---
Honestly think EM is overrated for ele shamans. Going 30/0/21 for Nature's Swiftness is slightly less burst but gives you a lot more utility.
---
MC on farm for the last month and we're running a lootcouncil system..... no drama so far. knock on wood.

No, sorry, Activision communication.

You are correct. What blizzard is doing is the correct course of action, but they should have announced it from the beginning, and they definitely screwed up if the transfer was briefly open to alliance and some people made it over.

PvE servers are 100% exactly the same as PvP servers except where you are forced to be flagged.  On PvP servers anywhere outside the first 2 starting zones you are flagged for PvP and on PvE servers you are forced to flag when entering enemy capital cities.

That said, you can elect to flag yourself anytime anywhere and you can flag up 24/7 on a PvE server.  The *real* difference is culture.  Players on PvP servers tend to PvP more and are more likely to center their gameplay around PvP.
---
Personal anecdote, I‚Äôve played for years on a PvP server and my friends new to wow were scared to try it so I went PvE.  I‚Äôve had my flag on all the time since level 52, but I very rarely get jumped.  It happens though.  The one disadvantage is that I always allow them the first punch because I have to (which as a rogue is challenging).  However, I never picked fights on PvP servers anyway, so for me it‚Äôs essentially the same.
---
The true test of ‚Äúis it worth it‚Äù to be on a PvP server will start on Thursday.  If no one flags up to fight then I chose poorly and it‚Äôs going to suck until phase 3.  If there are plenty of fights then it really didn‚Äôt matter.
---
Really? That's crazy
---
This will literally accomplish nothing but lining Blizzards pockets.
---
You‚Äôre about to have more gold in classic than most people do in retail lmao
---
yep my fd+trap works fine as well. But I agree on the pet pathing / responsiveness. They're scuffed.
---
Genuinely curious: Can you move around in the world with a full 5men group specced for PvP or will you just get dogpiled by 40 people when venturing into DM predungeon or BRM?
---
Dude half the population doesn't even know when the honor system is actually landing, tonight or thursday. It's sheer incompetence.
---
I think at this point the best solution would be unrestricted transfers off of Full, High or Medium Population Servers to *any* Low or Medium servers.
---
There should be a 1 week cooldown on transferring per character otherwise people would transfer daily and run MC 9 times in a week and stuff.
---
After a period of allowing that they should re-evaluate High pop servers, and combine low pop servers with severe faction balances.
---
Anything short of this is a half-measure.
---
Sounds like a Warlock
---
You don't need the buff, the reason he can't ML you the items is probably because the tribute is treated just like any chest or Majordomo's Cache.
---
Even with ML, anyone can go and grab the items from the chest, just like regular old iron/solid chests you find in the world.
---
Honestly I think I‚Äôm going to stay on the smaller server just because of the time I‚Äôve put into it, might just be time to try and see about larger guilds.
---
That's what I keep telling people. All the scrubs transferred off at the first sign of imbalance, and the average Alliance player left here is way better than the average Hordie. The ratio is terrible, but the quality is heavily skewed to the Alliance side.
---
People saying this clearly don‚Äôt have any dev experience. I‚Äôm not a WoW dev but having worked in IT there‚Äôs a long list of ways this add on could potentially be addressed... I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll work but saying they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù is being silly.
---
The two that come to mind immediately are:
---
* Reduce enemy player events to within 20 feet, same as nameplates. Doesn‚Äôt hurt anything and hugely reduces the mods effectiveness.
---
* Remove enemy player stealth events from combat logs entirely. Again, these serve no real purpose in the game.
---
Either or both of these would severely hampering the mods ability to hinder world PvP and would not hurt any other aspect of the game. There‚Äôs other options as well, so please don‚Äôt say they can‚Äôt change it, they very much could.
---
Did you not read my post? Both of these situations would be solved by being in a guild and doing full guild runs where everyone know the loot rules. Pugs were rare back in vanillia and people need to work on finding guilds so they dont have to pug raids. Guilds should be working to fill their spots so they dont have to pug anyone
---
Arena / Angerforge give literally no XP.
---
Well that certainly explains your shit posting then.
---
Pretty sure slander is specifically make somthing up about someone? You just posted his assholery.
---
PvE server?
---
This has been my experience too - I just hit  45 and haven't really been ganked, but doing dungeons is like an MINIMUM 1 hour prep as Alliance on Stalag. It's really hard to keeping doing them, and makes me miss the cross realm LFG.
---
What percentage of your dps are auto attacks? If it's 50%, and pummelers give you a 30% attack speed buff, that's 15% base dps increase. This is without any synergies from class mechanics, buffs, or items.
---
The people left didn't transfer off, they didn't do this to themselves lmao. Your logic is entirely self serving. 
---
Enjoy your 'PvP'.
---
Or completely limit the transfers to the dominant faction from the get-go, as everyone has been suggesting for months. None of that "small window for alliance players leaving stalagg/skeram/herod" nonsense. 
---
This was completely preventable, but blizzard chose the worst course of action.
---
On Grobbulus this is pretty much already the case lol. I dungeon'd most of the way 50-60.
---
^^^and ^^^I ^^^wouldn't ^^^have ^^^it ^^^any ^^^other ^^^way
---
So two points of comparison, character damage done on something like live news would be slander whereas an article would be libel.
---
Why are you guys leaving stalagg zzz we need alliance on there
---
yea just make sure all two of the druids communicate with eachother
---
We need to keep the games separate. 
---
I really dont like the idea of people playing classic for their retail accounts. 
---
It cheapens the achievements of those that completed the content back in the day. 
---
It also forces people who play retail to play classic for old achievements. Who will then call of qol changes and what not.
---
So just treat them as separate.
---
Nixe
---
Wpw
---
I've had numerous people attempt to gank me and have been able to FD+trap no problem
---
We killed Saurfang too.
---
Maybe you're not grouping with the right people, idk.
---
I know 1.12 made it super easy, but speed clearing is boring as shit. I want to see people struggle, grow, learn, get better, become a team.
---
This 100%. Imagine thinking North was the only person concerned about population balance and the only one making noise -- and recently at that.
---
People have been bringing the faction balance issue to Blizzard's attention for a very, very long time.
---
But so what? Because it could have exists in vanilla but didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs fine now..?
---
It‚Äôs too late
---
If he can get on right around server reset time and do them, SG tend to be pretty deserted.
---
From a game that is literally repetition.
---
From what perspective? Our hope is to provide the best content we can to a community we love and enjoy. The means by which we provide our content should remain within our domain.
---
If you joined a massive pop server then you have to deal with the economy of that server.  You chose the server and were given chances to transfer.
---
If their goal is to make this worse for themselves than mission accomplished.
---
alliance herod is pretty ghost towney if you aren't a hardcore raider. 5 man groups are rough to get off and then youre bound to be outnumbered when you try to get to an instance. 
---
I walked an alt to each realms ironforge and reaper did seem pretty sad
---
&gt;  Then got to domo with one mage
---
One Mage? Does not compute.
---
seems fine to me:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTkS5p2sgTc
---
I would definitely say /u/senojones feels the same way the majority (or at least a very large minority) do. My main issues are: 
---
1. Heartseeker Horde is currently DEAD. Like completely. It's not even being heavily outnumbered that bothers me - it's playing on a server where I can barely find groups or buy things off the AH.
---
2. I'm with a good friend group in a huge guild that will only act together. There's no way I can convince everyone to move by myself, and if we moved and the server were dead I'd feel horrible.
---
&gt; we knew that the majority of ally pop would transfer, further decimating the ally population
---
You're delusional thinking the majority of a server would transfer. Get out of your bubble.
---
Because running classic servers for 10000 players worldwide is not feasible. People don't want to constantly have to level up their character again. The amount of people who want to do that again and again and again is very small, enough to fill a pserver or two but not 200 like retail.
---
All i solod was tinkerer and princess. I did almost die once to one of the dimetredon packs though. I dont think i'd of been able to kill rotgrip haha.
---
Lmao you are giving Grizzly way too much credit. Suddenly Devilsaur collusion for 2 months is RUNNING THE WHOLE SERVER ON BOTH HORDE AND ALLIANCE!
---
Agree, what's the opportunity cost of not selling the essence of water? Need to subtract that from "profit".
---
Maybe could limit gold each char can have like for in retail they have for server transfers(like can only have 100k or so on each char).?
---
Fun for everyone. I literally didn't fight a single person, just nice to see it happening. I wasn't a part of it. Fun for the horde, who defended their home. Fun for the alliance rogues who stealthed and corpse jumped past to gank NPC's or dumb lowbies. Fun for the people who probably hid inside RFC and logged off so that 5 hours later they come back and gank unsuspecting noobs. I had all of these experiences and more back in the day. I'm glad they are still happening now.
---
Doing the Zul'Aman event for a shot at the Battle Bear was pure adrenaline when it came out.
---
No you didn't.
---
you should definitely be selling your xmute cds, tons of people need arcanite and will pay you 5-10g just to use your cd. unless you need them of course, then nevermind, but it's an easy bit of money every couple days
---
Be sure and spend extra time in Plague Lands. Totally worth doing all those quests and dying to entire guilds camping flightmasters...
---
Fucking *cringe*
---
He didn't make it into an addon. He translated a free guide into a form readable by the free addon guidelime.
---
Pyromancer is as follows:
---
Combat - Sap one of the adds, Evasion + Bladeflurry + Andren rush and kill pyromancer and the add. You should line up a 4-5point evisc for when the add is around 20% so that you can kill the add with the BF'd eviscerate.
---
Prep - Sap one, let energy return to full (assuming you have imp sap and weren't unlucky on the sap). I open with a cheap shot onto Pyrograine with an immediate expose armor followed by a mouseover blind on the add. When cheap shot wears off, I evasion. From here it's just a matter of killing pyromancer fast enough. From what I've seen and experienced, the add you blind is more likely to attempt to melee you if you are within melee range. If you're too far away it will blast you with spells. When you kill pyromancer you have to loot quick and vanish. Usually during this fight I'll chug a superior healing pot because you get them so frequently. If i get a real bad string of non resists and take a lot of damage I'll use a major health pot. Sometimes you get really bad RNG and die, I've got gutgore and CHT and some t1 and it still happens from time to time.
---
Plugger you lure the 4 adds away by throwing mugs into the wall by the feasts near him. Then when he's alone you just open and LoS him by the Thorium Brotherhood vendor. Very rarely he'll have a weird LoS issue and run to the adds by the tables - if he does this and aggros those adds you'll have to vanish or you'll die.
---
It doesn't.
---
But the video is lit AF.
---
I'm guessing they will transfer any alliance characters that got through back if they request it, since they are admitting that occured in error
---
And?  Its a service that was in vanilla and gives people choice of where to go
---
Timezone withstanding, people were remoting in to hit the transfer button in the first minute so they could beat the line. Nobody thought waiting 2-4 hours to get home was a reliable way to beat the cut off. But that cut off was less than 60 seconds. Just as OP mentioned, within the first minute, tons of people got the error, while friends and guildmates got the transfer to trigger. The error persisted for over a half an hour, then the error was replaced by the faction lock message. If people had known that it was going to be a lottery in the first minute of transfers, people wouldn't have attempted and thus no groups that wished to stay together would have been fucked over.
---
It‚Äôs  not spellbatching or lag this is a pathing issue, it happens very often in stratholme, you can fix it by moving back into line of sight of the mob and then back out.
---
Do you need to be hit capped for this?  It'd be embarrassing to miss all the yellow attacks and screw the raid.
---
My life's ambition has been to wield an arcanite reaper with a windufry shaman healing me. That's my orc motivation.
---
This sounds like a bad craigslist ad
---
I think what's putting them in a pickle is how Blizzard are constantly half-assing this stuff. This looks like such an easy process to be automated!! If the server queues are more than X minutes a day for the past month, allow free transfers. Is server imbalance more than 60-40, allow faction changes from one side. Have a month or two long cooldown before you're allowed to move again (to stop economic issues.)
---
You asked why it's slow now. You're in a healer spec and levelling mostly solo.
---
Their advice is good you just dont want it.
---
Yea they seem to be exaggerating any little turn you make. Ive also noticed that my wolf tends to linger over fallen mobs now that Ive trained Dash. Doesnt alwaysbhappen but I havent been paying close enough attention to say for sure.
---

---
Just for some perspective, Firemaw is about 45/55 Alliance/Horde and Skerem is closer to 35/65. Whatever you experience there, trust me it is worse on Skerem.
---
They can limit it significantly by not reporting enemy player buffs / 'auras' in the combat log.
---
People have everything on farm and there was no honour system before now, but people still think it is too soon. 
---
Have they ever thought they might be the slow ones?
---
Only DBM has long since been an assumed mod and all raid encounters are tuned as though players have it available. 
---
If anything I‚Äôm all for it as it allows more complex and interesting encounters to become standard.
---
How is blizz supposed to know which factions are unbalanced in the first moments of a server...?
---
Are you unironically saying that Alliance have a harder Onyxia attunement than Horde? Is this some inside joke I'm not a part of?
---
you are not the only person with this opinion.  but blizz doesn't give a crap.  unless it affects them dollars.
---
I think they need to ban addons all-together.. Sorry, maybe unpopular, but you guys wanted classic WoW.. 
---
I'm not sure how to detect if something is being run, but im sure it could be done.. 
---
I see people running bots all. the. time.... I followed some dude botting a warlock in duskwood for at least 45 minutes... He had on a simple program that would have him run to the center of the graveyard south of darkshire, then run to each corner, target enemies along the way, throw fireballs, kill, loot, then move on along the fence, return to the center, then do the other side, same thing, over and over and over... so I started fucking with em.. I opened a trade window with him while I had em on follow and his program couldnt tell it was there, so it would right click his conjured water, and put it in the trade box and he would just stand there instead of drinking... every time he targeted an enemy I targeted it and tagged it first so he would lose like all the xp and waste his mana shooting it.. eventually i just got bored... But it WAS fun.
---
Another reason why every single warrior in the guild should pug tank his own runs for gear, so all fury warriors have 2/3 preBiS tank gear when they are full fury preBiS. Makes tanking various bosses so much easier (Lucifron, Gehennas, Sulfuron, Domo, Garr).
---
so one guy ninjas a BOE blue and his reputation is ruined forever on that character? Punishment has to fit the crime.
---
It was in classic #NoChanges
---
So if the majority don't try to leave does that mean those who do leave have no real impact? So then there's nothing wrong with wanting to transfer away as ally in the first place.
---
Bop it
---
Thought there'd be terrible logic, but well played sir/ma'am.
---
An alt with level 1 enchanting can DE anything in the game. So you can always send BOEs to them to DE. 
---
You lose the ability to farm shards from BOP items. Other than that, not much of value is lost if you can rely on others for your enchants
---
what's wrong with that?
---
I'll add that I think this addon gives an unfair advantage in battlegrounds as well. Just as a couple examples, with how this addon works now, a flagcarrying druid will be able to gauge where and when a rogue stealths, making it much harder for a rogue to catch the druid out of bear. 
---
For AB, defenders of a flag now have a big advantage since they'll know when a rogue or druid stealths nearby, regardless if they saw the rogue stealth or not. The rogue has to stealth from a lot farther away or the defender will know he's there on spy. More than that, the defender could call out a rogue or druid in chat before the rogue/druid even open. 
---
It's too much in my opinion.
---
This is exactly what should happen now that they surprised everyone by making it suddenly about faction balance.
---
What else are people gonna do with their money? You're either super broke or aren't the type of people to contribute to guild. I have over 3k gold so of course I would donate, nothing else to do with it.
---
When Spy addon rings*
---
and 80% of the players polled are at least 50.
---
Big yikes, y'all.
---
I‚Äôm gonna level with you, you will have immense difficulty finding a raid group as a ret Paladin as they‚Äôre really not great. 
---
It isn‚Äôt about showing up on time or late for that matter, you‚Äôre gonna have to do some serious convincing or make some great friends with raid leaders to even be considered for a spot,
---
&gt;I really like the gear of a ret Paladin in the endgame but I just started played a couple days ago and I‚Äôm worried seeing these phases coming out so fast if I‚Äôll be able catch up with everyone else.
---
Don't worry about this, there's always people leveling, starting new alts or helping out friends, you'll have no problems finding groups and playing with people around your level as long as you look.
---
&gt;If I hit 60 in Jan. Or Feb. will it be too late for me to join in raiding, or be able to find a raiding spot as a ret Paladin?
---
Nope, but most guilds will ask that you go Holy since it's the preferred spec for Paladins, that being said... It's really not necessary since MC is quite easy.
---
That being said, there may be benefits to joining the game a bit later since it's likely a lot of your guild members will already have some epics by then, giving you a better chance at acquiring your own.
---
It's actually fucking disgusting that this has existed as long as it has. A U T H E N T I C   E X P E R I E N C E  W H E N ?
---
Really? The most popular posts in this sub are that the game is rushed, dm was too soon because i'm only level 20, p2 is too soon because i'm only level 30 type posts.

Yeah, 2 hand mortal strike build.  Went pole arms because they are cheap.  Also leveled semi-slowly am a semi avid-ah'er, and always made sure to have a strong weapon.  AH blues are a must for the weapons slot because instances blow cept for a couple every now and then for some quests,  I never spam run instances.  Also, i passed on the whole ww axe quest chain nightmare, since i went poles :)  No one goes poles since its "Newb", but you can get plenty slow pole arms imo.  Also better macro up.  Need a disarm macro, charge macro, shield bash macro, intercept macro, pummel macro.  These are OP.
---
So no question, just humble brag into face palm.....got it.
---
Hunters are the least gear dependent class.  You can literally go from 10-60 naked as long as you have ammo for your bow/gun.    They are desired in raids but they are more common than warlocks.  A good hunter who can pull mobs off healers, trap, slow, and kite is good to find.
---
Don't get too dissuaded by the simplicity of warlocks in raids.  Other than just nuking raid bosses with shadowbolt, they are a really fun class in MC as well, despite the simple rotation.  They also have the advantage of their raiding, soloing, and pvp spec all being the same: SM/Ruin.  Also most classes are pretty simple in raids, just as a consequence of the 16 debuff limit.
---
Turn off your ambient sound while fishing! Or use the FishingBuddy addon, which had the option to turn off your ambient sound when a fishing rod is equipped. It makes a massive difference.
---
This is true Vanilla status. Big respect.
---
you dont go tailoring to make gold
---
Low spawn rate generally means it respawns faster. High spawn rate generally means it takes longer to respawn.
---
Arcanite is actually less profitable than doing xmute fire to earth.  You earn more with arcanite, but you can do fire to earth once every 24 hours instead of once every 48.  
---
10g-15g every 2 days isn't exactly a lot of money though.  I just figured going into Alchemy I'd earn a lot more.  We'll see in the later phases.
---
I retained all my 2h axe skill after unlearning my talents and then re-talenting Two-Handed Weapons. I haven't used an axe since respeccing and it's at 180-something.
---
Edit: But I respecced back to it right away, I was just moving some other points around. Maybe it is different if you log out, respec again before talenting it, wait too long, or some other factor.
---
Timing will never be an issue getting into WoW raiding. Every guild runs every raid every week, as much as they can. A year from now, AQ guilds will run MC and Ony for T2 pieces, and even later on, Naxx guilds will run them for rare weapons and Thunderfury. There will always be guilds running these raids. It is never a bad time to get into Vanilla raiding.
---
No you could easily find a group. People are not just going to stop raiding MC once BWL comes out. If anything there will be more runs because people will have many alts at that point. Runs will be faster cause people will start getting BWL gear then clearing MC faster and faster.
---
I would suggest leveling on a PvE server though unless you really want to do world PvP later on.... cause with Phase 2 coming tomorrow you may have a bit of a rough time out in the world leveling on a PvP server.
---
I think its great, i just hope they dont wait too long before the give us BGs
---
Wasn't there an announcement the other day saying "realm transfers could close at any time without warning, so get it done asap"?
---
It's not like the transfers have just opened, it's been open for ages
---
If you‚Äôre Horde Arms is an A Tier raid spec, so long as you have a Shaman in your group with Windfury. 
---
If you‚Äôre Alliance it‚Äôs a B Tier spec, and you‚Äôll be out preformed by Ret Paladins.
---
Honestly, with my job and meeting friends in thr weekends i might just average 1hr/day, but probably less. 41 warr right now.
---
is this a wild dota copypasta in classicwow?
---
I like raptors in the Barrens that don‚Äôt have heads.
---
Because they want millions to play TBC, not 10k. 99% of players don't want to level again and again. It's only the small minority who played at private servers.
---
That sounds promising, thanks you
---
If you google DM Tribute runs, they'll include any possible skips that you can do.  I'm sure there's not like a hidden one only a few people are using or some crazy strat.  Most people are doing the same things.
---
Tittlating
---
&gt;Same players
---
Highly doubt that.  Plus people are complaining about the execution not the fact they exist.
---
I mean... addons were a *huge* part of vanilla WoW so I‚Äôm really not sure what your logic is there mate. And bots don‚Äôt run off the blizzard API, though amusingly in original vanilla they did as you could code an addon to play the entire game for you.
---
But my point is that addons and customisation are 100% part of the vanilla experience.
---
Are you making all the money from boosting people or from money and item drops?
---
I don‚Äôt think you can name change in classic.
---
But don't worry, I'm sure they'll get Classic+ right! /s
---
There are still people that believe that.
---
Lmao got me xD
---
Actually listening Clap
---
Yep, they're getting a lot of money from resubs of players that are playing a 12 year old game.... I love it!! But it needs blizzard love for sure. The quality of life is an issue right now, servers are holding 5-10x the population they should be. My server (Arugal) is still layered, it's going to be unplayable in a week's time. We can only hope that Blizzard has regained a sliver of its former glory and hasn't just completely rotted away into a husk of its greedy current self. I don't think Blizzard is going to last another 5 years, they're going to die trying to appeal to the nostalgic crowds.
---
For an xp run not looting is fine but handing the money is weird.  Im not about to hire a bookkeeper just to know how much im supposed to pay someone.
---
You certainly could. The point really was that prot spec doesn't give you an awful lot of mitigation, and a lot of "deep prot" specs don't take all the mitigation that's on offer anyway.

One guy on here yesterday was 11 days played and only low 40s but was posting complaining how WoW classic leveling is too slow.
---
I don't think you understand your own post. 
---
This isn't Vanilla, this is Classic; so the same mindset doesn't apply. I played Vanilla as a main tank. For the server I was initially on, we had 3 guilds to run raids as a group. We didn't pug then but its **very** common in Classic. MC and Onyxia are very easy fights. When I changed servers to raid BWL/AQ40/Naxx, the guild I "applied" for had a feeder guild which was common. These were essentially pugs to fill open slots. The one constant between Vanilla and Classic is that there are stupid people. People still get knocked into whelps or forget to run out as the bomb on Geddon.
---
I've been on various servers horde and alliance in Classic and the common theme is that guilds that "mass recruit" are mostly trash guilds because you're a *number*, not a *player*. 
---
The best advise is to find a guild of people that you like, that like you, and share common goals. Form a community around that and include other like minded people.
---
Your train of thought is more "don't do any raids until you have 40 committed people!". But I can tell you first hand that having a good team to lead the raids and keep it smooth encourages people to come to your guild. (Whether they're in another guild or unguilded doesn't matter. Once you hit your cap you can stop pugging. 
---
* Small guilds are a thing
---
* Small guilds aren't bad
---
* Pug if you want.
---
* It's about community, not about the size of the guild.
---
If you download questie, it can query the server to see all the quests that you've completed.  Hover over the minimap icon and check the commands to pull up the log.  I forgot what it is.
---
This function was added in WotLK with the achievement system to help people with the questing achievements for "Complete XX quests in Eastern Kingdoms" and the like.  It wasn't removed when they reverted the changes to go back down to 1.13
---
I am ally skeram and all of my related discords are rejoicing right now.  This was a great move.  Despite being severely outnumbered,  we actually have a pretty strong coalition of endgame guilds.  6/10 top raiding guilds on the server are alliance according to warcraftlogs.  Not having to stress about any of them jumping ship is a huge weight off the shoulders.

Being the only mage in a raid is like a wet dream for me holy shit.
---
I've been raiding for 5 weeks and haven't gotten any gear due to there being at least 5-8 other people I'm rolling against.
---
yes, I agree half the population is clearly incompetent if they dont know when the honor system is dropping because the blue post blizz made about it was very clear.
---
Dude, why on earth would any alliance, let alone 4 guilds of probably 40+ each, transfer to Heartseeker? You guys are going to kill the server on a whole different scale. There will be 40,000 people online, all alliance, standing around the TP FP waiting for the 5 horde left on the server to get off work and accidentally fly there. All the while blaming Blizzard for allowing them to do something so stupid...
---
Dungeon like mad. Only go out to do key quest chains. Time to get gear!
---
Basically there's 2 things happening where groups are forming to consistently run lower level parts of brd only.  
---
First: Arena farm.  Arena is an event boss where you get one of a few possible bosses.  One of these bosses drops an epic mail chestpiece that is "bis pre-raid"  for some people, mainly fury warriors.   Basically you run in, kill minimal things, kill the arena boss event and run out. Reset and do it again.  Youll usually end up with a grp of 60's or close to it.  Youll do the 5 runs in like 20-30 min and hit ur instance cap for the hour.  Some groups will be doing angerforge as well as Arena.  Hes a pretty easy boss and is lvl 57.  So you might wanna get to 54 before pugging him.  53 in a solid guild grp. 
---
Second thing:. Ony atunement questline.  Everyone wants to raid the loot pinata.  This one starts outside of brd in burning steppes.  Couple quests there then ppl are sent in to find marshal windsor in brd.  You do, he tells you to go back to the fellow in burning steppes.  Who tells you to go back and get a crumpled note.  You get it, bring it to marshal windsor in brd, he tells u to kill two bosses for some info (a drop) thats angerforge and golem lord.  Ur gonna wanna be 55+ to tank this stage of it in the wild world of pugs.  Then after you bring back the two things marshal windsor wants to be broken out of jail, you escort him thru a massive tour of the place staying in the tunnels that circle around the begining bit.  This can be done at ur lvl now. This part is something people are often doing seperate from the previous part because they pugged brd runs that didn't want to go back to marshal windsor after golem lord so they have to continue the questline on their next run. There arent really any bosses involved with this part but a group may choose to hit ones that are close by.

I don't agree with someone stealing your content, I'm just saying your content is not implemented in an optimal manner right now. You could see this post as an opportunity to transition your content into an official addon, which can still be monetized, rather than having a strictly negative reaction and asking people to use the browser instead of a more convenient method. You should ask, why did OP take your guide and make it into an addon in the first place? Because a browser-based guide is not a good experience for the user. 
---
I tried your leveling guide and stopped after a few levels because I wasn't interested in tabbing back and forth to a browser to continue. Now I use a couple different in-game leveling guides provided through addons. Your implementation of your guide didn't even allow me to judge whether your content was better than other guides or not, because I couldn't stand the browser aspect of it enough to stick with it.
---
Very little alliance to very many horde
---
 Lol jk that's dumb
---
 You must have missed the census post from earlier ??
---
 It's not solid data but it's raid logs so should you who's kinda at endgame on each server.  And some were let's just say pretty bad. 
---
 Only ones that were alliance dominated were like 90/10 for alliance lol 
---
 Grobbulas was actually like 49.4/50.6 and was basically balanced. Handful were no worse than 60/40.
---
 But some were 70/30, 75/25 where your server in question fell into that bracket.
---
The bugs weren't as bad on LH, admittedly. They were there and worse than classic but they were manageable. The rolls backs are what really annoyed me. The bugs were bad on Ely. Ely in general was just cancer as a whole, pay to win once xp tokens came out and with a terrible community. 
---
No game like this will ever be bug free but compared to Ely or LH, classic has been faaaar more bug free for myself and the people I've encountered. This was the main reason I wanted official servers. I've never walked directly through normal terrain, in classic, in such a way that my character completely disappears on a very small incline on a hill such as the ones in duskwood or WPL/EPL, as an example. Nor have I been able to abuse any of the dungeon(specifically LBRS) hunter pet bugs for retail levels of free gear. Bar none, we are using the original code, not someone's Frankenstein YouTube guessed code, however enjoyable it may be
---
Ah, yes, you're right about the server hostage. If I recall it was for a few hours, not days. I wasn't playing during that time so I couldn't give you a play by play argument to debate. One difference is that the classic server kidknapper was found out, but not the others iirc.
---
It's never too late to start people will run MC and ony forever to gear alts you may have trouble finding a spot as a retailer pally in new content but they would probably let you tag along on farm runs
---
Lava flow works the same as water except It damages you so yes
---
57, soloing BRD pickpocketing for gold &amp; killing Plugger, got the chest, trying for the shanker while waiting for arena/anger groups.
---
Farmed enough gold for: both devilsaur, DM trinket, semi-bis bracers, Krol blade &amp; double fiery weapon enchants.
---
I plan to continue, might possibly have epic mount gold when I ding 60, just wanted to make sure that Anger actually had HoJ still because everyone in the groups I join have had the same luck as me, and no one I've talked to in game has seen it drop for a month or more.
---
They haven't catered to the no lifers though, the average casual player should be reaching 60 right around now. 80% of the results have people at least level 50. So at worst PvP might be a week or so early?
---
They are 140g on Gehennas EU.
---
Nah we are fine, only the babies complained. More horde scalps for us.
---
If I farm the waters myself the cost is my time. I make 100g from a half to an hour of farming. Don't see how that's different than farming and vendoring greys and those being considered profit.
---
It kinda triggers me that you have the Unadorned Seal of Ascension and all 3 gemstones sitting in your bank...
---
I thought it was from CS GO?
---
Azure silk belt, the costume, and swim speed potions all stack. Try it out if you have any candy left
---
Yep for sure. I know most of my guild and including me are more excited about the possibility of BC and maybe even wrath.   
---
But Idk if you guys had the same problem but around 6-8pm EDT last night they tried to condense to 1 layer and ironforge/stormwind was impossible. There was a 5-10 second delay on everything and everybody was teleporting. Still showed 2 layers but it was obvious what they were trying to do. Even last week on one of our layers we have like 5-7 guilds pop ONY head last tuesday and took everybody 1 minute to get head buff and another 30 seconds to actually log out.   
---
The servers are 100% going to break tomorrow. My opinion is they will release pvp on thursday but wont layer. What they NEED to do is push back pvp and figure out what they need to do to fix the servers. But they wont, and they will release pvp and half the servers are goign to break and people are going to rage and cry.
---
Mate in vanilla some guy released a pvp addon that put enemy faction as red dots on your minimap and tracked their distance from you. Spy is not bad, people just complain.
---
Lol who said anything about me? Arrogant much?
---
I wouldn't want to raid these raids even at normal pace because I like my games with some challenge.
---
Then announce transfer shutdowns a week in advance, saying that they will start up again in a couple of months. After the shutdown, wait a day or two, then start the new ones up that are faction specific, without announcing the rules beforehand. Fewer people get fucked, it's faction balanced, and people get what they want.
---
If only my son was just a few years older!
---
You deserve it for betraying your brethren.
---
Except the traffic flow classicwow.live gets from people using their guide is going to be drastically reduced because some asshat stole their guide without permission.
---
Mine was a leveling/farming bot at 3
---
Everytime i have had an issue, my ticket has been resolved in under 3 responses. 
---
I feel this is a moment of everyone being an arsehole means you are infact the arsehole. 
---
Change your outlook and your life will change.
---
I had briefly entertained the idea of something similar but swapping some points into resto from enh. My goal wasnt for PvP but actually to reduce mana usage for a farming toon duoed with a warrior. The idea was to chain lightning, shock, then melee/heal while CL was on CD. Overall I think I decided it was fairly pointless in that yes it achieved the goal, but overall wasnt any better than a straight ele/enh or ele/resto hybrid.
---
this is better than wasting hours death running into instances and have your group disband because of BRM camping for late game.
---
The alliance on those servers is best served transferring off, gear up and prep for BGs.
---
it is far worse being shut down and slowed on gear progression than it is to not have wpvp.
---
What really helps for me in order to be able to keep doing quests without feeling I'm too low level for them is to grind everywhere you are traveling. You need to get to some part of the map for a quest? Mobs between where you are and your destination are at least green? Kill your way there. For me, since there is a destination to my grind, I don't mind the grinding that much and thereby 'trick' myself into grinding constantly. Only downside is your bags do fill up quickly (most mobs drop something that stacks, but if you kill already 5 different mob types before you're where you need to be, you have like 2-3 of each instead of nice stacks. Just invest in bagspace as soon as you got money to spare). Hope this helps!
---
When my bro got his Bow quest done he felt like he had accomplished a major feat. He's told me how sad it is that some hunters can't take the time and do it themselves. He says back in vanilla Him and some of his guild mates called these lazy hunters Hunt-azies cause they were so damn lazy they didn't wanna take the time to put in the effort and do it them selves.
---
You can heal any dungeon as shadow, just get used to cancel casting a lot more since you add .5 seconds to the cast time for your heals. 
---
Solo farming mara princess runs can be quite lucrative with herbalism as well as some herbs in that range can be highly priced. 
---
If you haven't gotten the dire maul healing trinket from the holy Bologna book yet, go grab that as well. It's pretty much BiS for the time being and is going for like 7g on my server.
---
Here on Herod I see more female orcs than I do alliance.
---
Also, female orc player here.
---
Not really any good macro work around but an addon which fills the gap is Necrosis. It's a superb warlock addon in general.
---
Thats what you get for rolling alliance to begin with,  I guess.
---
I suspect you are correct that players who play more are over represented in this subreddit. However, we do not know the extent of this over representation. It very well could be fairly marginal. After all, a lot of people use reddit. 
---
But, over 60% of the subreddit have archived a level 60 character... while well under half of my friends who play the game have.  I would be \*very\* surprised if that figure, 60%, was even close to accurate for the player base in general. If anything, I reckon the results of this survey indicate that the occupants of this sub are typically much more active players than the player base in general.
---
I imagine they will leave us on BWL for a long time. Same with AQ and ZG. I think some people were surprised at how easy MC and Ony are on 1.12 patch and some pservers were tuned to be tougher.
---
I do have it but how does it help in this specific area?
---
My server is high pop, almost full, and I'm on the much larger faction. 
---
I would more than happily transfer now seeing how things are with layers gone if I was given the option. Even if it meant I was going to be the underdog on the new server.
---
It's definitely an uphill battle, you can never get a summom off in front of a dungeon, you're going to corpse walk to any instance at least once but likely more for stuff like brd/lbrs/mc.  Took me numerous attempts to finish tirions quest line, and all this is before honorable kills... We always end up using another account to reset dungeons to not risk dying by walking out to reset.  When we first transferred it was low pop so leveling was easy, now idk.  It's impossible to be stopped from playing corpse hopscotch so everything just takes longer.
---
&gt;I want to pvp on a balanced server.
---
Gonna warn you now if you didn't already know, balanced faction populations are the exception - not the rule
---
I rolled a PvE server this time and I'm enjoying the game *much* more.  There were zones I never even stepped into in vanilla (like STV) because they were so gank heavy
---
Yeah, just go feral man, feral quests efficiently in cat and gets easily into groups in bear
---
Menethil Harbour or IF
---
Well, I started farming pre-BiS at level 52, when I was at around 4-5 days played. Then I maxed at 9 days played, and I‚Äôm currently at around 13 days played. So you‚Äôre missing the 4-5 days played from level 52-60 that was spend almost exclusively doing dungeon runs. 
---
I‚Äôll follow up with some pics after work.
---
Azuresong Mageblade drops.  Paladin healer proceeds to shit pants because loot council decided we were good on healing and awarded it to a DPS.
---
For most of them it's just an excuse for being a crap leveller.
---
Even with work I can get to 60 in 2 real weeks. And I'm not a great leveller.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=speed
---
This should tell you enough lad
---
This is the exact cause of the issue and I‚Äôve not been able to find a workaround besides not using a macro.
---
And either way you spin it you‚Äôre still letting them peg you in the ass while you defend their incompetence.
---
Nice.
---
They cleared this up muiltple times, it‚Äôs Thursday.
---
You can move the area where the pop up happens. I have everything on miks,. Except the proc notifications turned off, and use default blizz scrolling, because I couldn't get miks to notify me of my riposte procs. I like it better this way because I wasn't a fan of miks scrolling animations. 
---
I moved my notifications right next to my toon of the left, so it's basically right in my face.
---
What are the chances of getting banned for buying gold?
---
There's 2 problems with upvote logic
---
1. It's skewed towards low effort posts. By low effort I mean it's low effort to get engaged. People are far more likely to look at a pic or read a sentence, smile, press upvote and move on. Far more likely than they are to read a paragraph or three, understand the content and put in their 2 cents
---
2. It's "tyranny of the majority". What I mean is whilst it's true that the majority are happy with memes and dad gamers, there's also people who are not happy with that. Even if they downvote, it won't make a difference. Should they be excluded because they're a minority?
---
Which leaves people hiding/ignoring almost the entirety of the sub
---
External forums are never that good, there's a reason Reddit has been successful
---
Again, it doesn't bother me but it's easy to see why. Running a sub takes a lot of work and these people have no where else to go for classic discussion
---
HealComm is supposed to improve crosstalk between addons. I thought Clique only helps you to cast keys √° la mouseover style rather than dealing with incoming heals? 
---
Using Grid2 myself, which has an option for "incoming heals" as well - in addition to healcomm. 
---
And yes, other healers need some form of addon to support it too.
---
We're at a point where enough of our server is rerolling or levelling alts that people running SM or ZF is as popular as BRD at the moment.
---
Someone has to do it. What kind of stupid answer are you giving
---
It's easier if you don't resist..
---
I've played a priest for 14 years, including spriest in vanilla and right now.  Don't assume I don't know anything just because you don't agree.
---
None of those things spriest brings are exclusive to spriest.  Regular healing priests bring all the same utility, plus more in the form of, you know, actual heals.
---
It's widely known spriest scales badly throughout vanilla's lifecycle, if you don't even know that it would tell any serious spriest player that you don't *really* know much about it.
---
They should just be willing to work with people on these considering the shit state of servers on release and all the shit it has caused. Instead of being cunts.
---
Your points, while valid and something we consider, ignore the premise that we were not expressly consulted about the distribution of our content. 
---
We are looking at ways to optimize the content for multiple methods of user preference. The purpose of the post was to state that should be our prerogative.
---
Got mine off curseforge, because twitch doesn't have it for some reason. I'm at work atm, or I'd link it.
---
Yarp.
---
As someone who was RP server in vanilla, and is again in Classic, I got all my ranks in BG's anyways so I'm just looking to Phase 3 for PvP.  I figure I'll suck my way to at least Knight again just through sheer persistence.
---
Same thing happened to me in Scholo today! Walked for about 3-4 seconds pulling another group
---
If you‚Äôre looking for accurate data, no.
---
I was reading this with a serious tone in my head until turd burglar.
---
We did it reddit!
---
Why do people keep bringing up classic + like it‚Äôs a possibility? Did Blizzard actually say anything that might lead people to think that it is it just a fantasy that the community it‚Äôs holding onto.
---
&gt; You exited combat successfully for long enough to cast trap at the end of the video. the point of the macro is that it will allow you to do things faster than a human can react.
---
The macro doesn't change the delay.
---
im sure the majority horde side would kill to go to a minority horde side with a lower pop server. sounds like an amazing idea
---
Don't think there's anything very accurate. Blizzard broke the API that census addons use, afaik.
---
And here I am, playing with a guild that is wiping on Baron Geddon.
---
Any horde guilds on Rattlegore need a warrior?
---
You beat a class you counter in every aspect of the game. You're a pretty good player
---
It is my favourite addon as a rogue.
---
I think you guys are roguing wrong.
---
Would you buy one of the blades and constantly open trade with him to show it?
---
YOU STOLE MY FUCKING CLOUDSONG!
---
Each to their own. The great thing is as locks we‚Äôve got some great options.
---
Wrong. They want millions to play retail
---
Or you know get to lv 60 by doing aomething giving 5x as much xp and then doing HoJ skip runs.
---
Its simply faster to not do these runs while leveling.
---
That doesn't matter, the flurry axe isn't BiS. This is why you see most of the top parsers on horde playing orc opt for the Bone Slicing Hatchet, it's a 1.7 speed axe with 13 agility and you can use an elemental sharpening stone on it, resulting in 3.65% more crit than if you were using flurry axe. The flurry axe is only better if you're an orc using the devilsaur set and don't plan on using any elemental sharpening stones. Also, a lot of the "BiS" lists which suggest you use the flurry axe, also includes gear which would get you 11% hit which is completely pointless. You gain no benefit from stacking hit rather than crit past 6% hit if your weapon skill is above 305, again referring to information that is relatively widespread by now and the fact that noone of the top parsers for warriors are stacking massive amounts of hit. They're all generally around ~6% hit
---
It's too late in the sense that the leveling experience sucks now that most servers are fleshed out (or fairly dead outside of peak hours.)
---
There is literally nothing similar to the first 3 weeks where you can 24/7 find a dungeon no matter what the level range.
---
^ That is the most enjoyable experience for many players.
---
Even as a tank nowadays, there's a fairly long wait time to fill out groups when leveling. And forget about trying to do SM/SFK as alliance.
---
Playing classic just for the raids is.. a bit suspect. The raids aren't that good. TBH, you're better off just playing retail, FFXIV, or any other big 5 MMORPG if you just want to raid.
---
We just started doing guild runs.
---
We usually PuG about half the group, but yesterday, our MC run was like 20 of our members with 15 members from another guild that doesn't have enough people to run 2 raids, so those are people we are hoping will join us if things go well...
---
I'm our guild's Loot Master. We're a rather casual guild and plan on using DKP when we have a 40+ raiders core.
---
All in all, it was a smooth run (loot drama aside), we went 8/10, which is pretty decent for a first run and we're hoping to down Domo and Rag tonight.
---
Anyhow, here's the loot drama we got from that single run.
---
We ran an open roll, +1, MS &gt; OS loot.
---
* Lucifron dropped the FR Wand. A 57 Mage rolled on it straight away and won it. So far, so good...
---
* Magmadar dropped Eskhandar's Right Claw. Our MT rolled on it, despite not even having the Fist Weapon skill, but hey, no one else wanted it, so it's all good...
---
* Gehennas dropped the Ring of Spell Power. A Holy Paladin rolled a 97 on it and would've won it, but our MT and some other started saying on Discord that it was really a Caster Ring and that healers have better options, so the Paladin ended up passing on it. Very generous of him, but not a decision or turn of event I personally agreed with.
---
* Garr dropped Aged Core Leather Gloves. Our GM, a Dagger Rogue, rolled on it, but a Fury Warrior who wanted the STR and crit% won it. No harm done, we're not running loot council or anything and the GM doesn't want to start shit over an item he knows he'll get anyways, sooner or later.
---
* Shazzrah dropped the Arcanist Gloves. Remember that 57 Mage? He rolled on it despite using his "+1" on the Wand on the first boss. Naturally, it went to the next highest roll, at which point the 57 started QQing in chat.
---
* Sulfuron dropped the highly sought-after Shadowstrike. A Fury Warrior wanted to roll on it, but was convinced by people on Discord not to waste his roll on it since it's so bad. He asked if he could still get it if no one else wanted it, but we ended up Disenchanting it. Not my decision, but it's the usual outcome for that PoS. Thing is, someone actually wanted it, for once... Furthermore, the 57 Mage is still QQing at the idea that the Warrior almost got the weapon off a "greed" roll which wouldn't have counted against his "+1", wondering why the Wand he won off the first boss counted...
---
* Golemagg dropped the Azuresong Mageblade and the Lawbringer Chestguard... The Azuresong Mageblade was won by our top DPS Mage who was already rocking a Staff of Dominance he had won with another guild before joining us. Some people voiced their opinion that it should've went to someone who would've benefited more from it and the 57 Mage is going mental at still not being allowed to roll on anything since he already won something. Then, before I can even ask Paladins to roll on their T1 Chest, the MT tells me we should reward the Paladin who passed on the Ring of Spell Power he had "won" earlier. \*hint hint\*. Yeah, but no. In the end, another Paladin won the roll, but for some reason, I misclicked and gave the item to another Paladin who promptly logged out so he wouldn't be asked to trade it to its rightful owner. Not only are both Paladins in our guild, but they're actually RL friends. And the Paladin who didn't get his due tells us straight away that the other is a selfish cunt and will not give him the chest. I feel like shit for my error and can't really find a solution to the issue and, to be honest, I'm sick and tired of the drama from our first guild MC run at this point...
---
Oh, and when we did Onyxia on Wednesday, our GM and RL forgot to turn on Master Looter, so when we downed her, everyone could roll on everything, but luckily, no one rolled on what they shouldn't have, so that wasn't so bad.
---
So, yeah, that's my "loot drama" story, after only 1 week of guild-raiding. Stay tuned for next week...
---
Glad to see someone using this method. I got all excited after seeing the posts about it a while ago but haven‚Äôt seen anyone raid MT with it yet, mind you I was looking too hard. Looks like I‚Äôll be keeping my Pally proT spec after all.
---
Currently Horde - US - Faerlina - PvP
---
Former Death and Taxes Vanilla Raider looking for guild.
---
I was present for multiple World + US First/Top5 kills including the World First 4 Horsemen and have experience clearing all of Naxx 40. 
---
Currently playing on Faerlina Horde, but willing to reroll anywhere.
---
On Faerlina I have a 60 Warlock and 52 Rogue, I'd be willing to play either.
---
If I reroll I'd love to raid on a mage.
---
Nothing wrong with you wanting to leave, stating that "majority of alliance will transfer" is both factually incorrect and utterly misleading. All I'm saying.
---
People upvoted this comment
---
That's how it is in my guild.
---
Literally the only place worth using them
---
Honour is out on Thursday not tomorrow. But your point still stands haha
---
Yeah that was pretty laggy, got the vid right here (: https://youtu.be/uJuh02UY4_0
---
Yup - I saw easily thirty people in crossroads yesterday at a single moment.
---
Wow always had plenty of alts being leveled. Don't worry about it.
---
Then why is that leaving player feedback is a bad thing? 
---
You act as if this sub is out there to just complain for no reason.
---
People got the characters they worked on for months ruined because they transferred before faction specific transfers rolled out, this is 100% a genuine problem that deserves backlash because of Blizzard‚Äôs incompetence and they should fix the problem.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that not every post is going to be some boomer hitting 60 in BRD, go back to /r/wow if you wanna just slurp whatever excrement comes out of Blizzard‚Äôs asscheeks.
---
&gt;two hours   
---
&gt;every single day since release  
---
&gt; and still not be level 60
---
No shit, but you chose to italicize like the daily part matters hence why it's stupid.
---
I really enjoy your videos. I would love try it sometime.
---
Nothing better than KOS as a rogue in farming areas. Means my favourite prey is close
---
Dude dont waste your energy on this tool. Obviously he just wants to be right and have the world cater to his ignorance.
---
Just because something is free does not mean it is convertible into other formats, products, etc. without the express consent of its owner(s).
---
Double hit is better than crit most of the time.
---
40 when you get MS
---
Sounds like you fucked up
---
I you are on a med high pop server like me its not hard to control 2. Look for the one in a zone and once you find it set your 1 hour timer. I check burning steppes first then fly to silitus(druid). 
---
Sometimes I just focus on the silitus spawn as it is rarely picked and I can pop over to un'goro for the dreamfoil and silversage while i wait on the respawn.
---
The 0/30/21 'HoTW/NS' build can main heal and offtank in raids, and main tank, dps or main heal any 5 man.
---
I run a more tanking-focussed build, but with Int gear I can main heal 5 mans.
---
late 30s when u get ww axe and sm set
---
Cant upvote this enough.
---
According to what? You really want to use a legal argument and legal talk, show me according to what that we aren't allowed to.
---
No one is going to really be a learner, so many have done it before that any raid you join will have a core who know what they are doing and it will be explained thoroughly. Plus the content is much easier than retail mechanics wise. I just mean that you will likely be joining groups with the gear to just plough through and you will likely be gearing up quicker rolling against largely peoples alts. For some this is good if you want to get to the next tier, for others they might be upset it's not challenging. Regardless people will still be doing the content.
---
Dude look around. People are melting
---
Medically speaking, there's no such thing as catching up on sleep.  The damage done is permanent.
---
1 per zone with a respawn between 60 to 80 mins.
---
I've hardcore raided for a long time. I also enjoy quick MC clears so I can get gear and hop into world PvP and farming.
---
Lol thanks. I feel like I'm going to need the good luck. And a lot of it.
---
Yeah that works out pretty good then. Harder to find groups at off times but easier to farm is a good tradeoff. Will be able to stack some gold or crafting mats on days off work.
---
I work for myself and usually work until 6pm and suck at sleeping so I'm usually up until **at least** 2am, so being able to find groups from 9pm-4am is crucial for me.
---
I‚Äôm not much of one for discord, but You said you‚Äôre using GBOK for threat but in the talents you posted you don‚Äôt have BOK talented. Do you normally move that point from IBOP to BOK?
---
It was a big that warlock didn‚Äôt get to roll tho.
---
imagine not sponsoring salad bakers @monsterenergy
---
Looking through OP post history he flames and argues on LoL sub reddit. That answers it all folks.
---
That's what I'm saying.
---
Why is everyone so concerned about black lotus all the sudden?  And why does everyone think you'll need full flask to take down BWL and AQ.  Bet you won't.
---
That's not our sub. I don't moderate that sub for example.
---
God this is like a play by play of my last 3 weeks constant bitching from mages especially since they have to compete against 6-7 other mages. God I swear loot entitled people won‚Äôt make past MC.
---
I was at 32 this week but sold a bunch to get the rest of my epic mount money.
---
When I had an alliance engineer mage I made mine everlook for the quick flight to felwood winterspring for farming/PvP.
---
I like these addons myself but the issue with addons is that players who know how to code certain basics such as lua have a massive advantage over players that don't. You can write ridiculously powerful weakaura's or just your own addons. There is a reason why the world first guilds in retail basicially all have their own addon coders they can create an addon for whatever they need. People might say "oh well just install it yourself" but it's not nearly as easy because many addons aren't actually being published so unless you know how to create such addons yourself your out of luck. Also, for me personally it was a huge turnoff as a new player years ago when first found out about addons. You get your ass handed to you by some guy who kicks each of your important spells, tell the guild how good that guy is and then some guild member tells you that he most likely just uses OmniBar which is basicially a must have in retail Arena considering how powerful it is. I, and many others, felt like I just got cheated on since the guy had an advantage over me obtained by something from outside the game.
---
People want to parse high and they have a lot of gold to spend on flasks.
---
the delay you have between hitting the action and actually doing the animation/exiting combat is 100% not happening to me.  
---
I'd try running without any add ons and see if it happens still.  Maybe due to poor server performance or something.  
---
That is not how it's working for me at all.  That said, I could still work with it, the macro would allow you to get the trap off despite the exiting of combat being unpredictably delayed.   
---
I would not be able to manually time that, because of that long ass wait.  
---
you have a valid concern, your mistake is insisting that this is a problem with feign death and not something with your server/connection/addons etc...
---
Have you tried submitting a ticket about this? In all likelyhood they'll probably transfer him back or let you transfer so you two can be together. Considering this was an error on their end, they usually won't say no
---
Running deep resto. But I will be ranking as 30/0/21. 
---
I‚Äôll put 55 healing on the ZG hammer or similar.
---
only way this could have indicated 2005 any more was if he had said it as "pr0n"
---
It depends on the guys goals, any casual guild will take a ret pally. Hell most raids I've been in so far have had some level 56-58 guys in there and still clear MC no issue. He isn't going to be optimal but there's guilds who will take whatever.
---
Your guild master also sounds like an entitled prick, That's great you have found yourself a group of like-minded individuals to play with.  
---
I'm happy someone (rightfully) "stole" his name. May that character go on to be the best damn bank alt we've ever seen.
---
I mean it‚Äôs a dps weapon before it‚Äôs a healer. I feel that pain one of our mages is mad the first mage blas√© is going to be given to the top dps mage. Sorry bro bring pots and shit and compete.
---
I like world PvP but unfortunately I'm not 60 yet. The world is already too crowded. Searing gorge last night for me was competing with twenty other people for mob drops and then some 60s camping us. Not looking forward to having dozens more doing the same. Not too upset by it but disappointed I probably won't get to join in on the fun. Level an alt until things calm down I reckon.
---
Super fun event, love this server
---
I remember people on this sub talking shit to me for rolling on a pve server. Why anyone would want to have their limited playtime wasted by ganks is beyond me. If I want to pvp all I have to do is mark myself and/or join a raid group to attack org or something. 90% of pvp happening on pvp servers is when one side completely outclasses/out mans the other.

Looking for a casual guild that I can join and eventually raid with. I'm low level now, but figured if I join a guild now I can get to know the members and have a better fit come endgame. I would like the guild to have some lowbies in it that I can group with. Once I hit 60 I'd prefer to tank, but if the guild needs a healer I'd be willing to re-spec. The (#) most important things I want in a guild are: 1) most active during evenings PST and ultimately has raid times within my availability window 7:30pm to 11:30pm, 2) casual, but still focused on goals and progression; 3) Has some lowbies in it now so I can group with people my level as I level up.
---
Awesome to hear would!
---
If you're leveling arms around level 40 is when you're going to start switching into feeling like a badass. Sweeping strikes + mortal strike combos, then stance dancing into berserker stance and whirlwinding, watching the whirlwind also proc sweeping strikes. Seeing all those numbers stacking is so satisfying and you can safely take on 2 mobs at a time. If you're playing fury however, you won't start to feel good until you're 60 and get your hit cap. Fury is far more reliant on hit than arms, which is the main reason Dual Wield leveling is discouraged. You're always going to have it rougher than other classes (unless you have a pocket healer). Warriors are all about the end game. As a warrior myself, I gotta say the satisfaction of hitting 60 after all that makes it so worth it.
---
if you do watch the video, he has like a 3 second delay between popping the action, and actually exiting combat.... 
---
so he has a real concern, but he's wrong in insisting it's a problem for everyone.
---
Only way to name change at the moment is to reroll a new toon
---
Make a deal with your SO and talk to her about it. Two nights a week are for raiding and my SO understands I can't just step away.  She gets that it's an activity I enjoy and the rest of the week, I can help around the house.
---
Talk to them like they're a person and you won't have aggro.  Consider it "mind soothe" IRL.
---
Hear the beep? You know when you are detected?
---
Big difference between casuals pugging and organized keeners power leveling.
---
Aoe runs are much more common pre 50 thats for sure.
---
item rack
---
Yeah but if you have to farm Anger 100x to see a HOJ or Golem 150X to see a Second a Wind- that‚Äôs atleast 2-3 levels worth of XP. So why wait till 60 if it‚Äôs gonna take 100 runs regardless?
---
goBaCktOrEtaIl he says
---
Have you tried submitting a ticket yet? I've had mistakes with transfers before (one time it was a problem on blizz's end) and most of the time they'll offer a re-transfer back to where they came from, or they'll let you transfer despite this new limitation.
---
Mention the fact that some of your friends already transferred, the blue post said you had time, and yet it ended before you could transfer anyways
---
But what am I supposed to do with this pitchfork now??
---
We had worst issues with limited council and rolls so we‚Äôre goin to a points based system. Children cry about pixels to much for this 30 year old.
---
Literally the mods showed up and proved me right mate, try reading. Literally any sub you go to will back up my claim. Good luck finding one backing up his claim. I can't prove a negative so he needs to provide proof. Not my fault you idiots don't understand how to argue correctly.
---
How is this possible, if one bought that amount of bl for like say 30g, that would amount to about 27k gold
---
I feel pity for them somewhat, but then I know they were coming to a server that was already 83%/17% ratio before this wave of transfers. So I can't say I'm crying too many tears knowing half of them got left behind. I will say it's fucked up though on Blizzard's part. They should give everyone a free revert.
---
Depends if you prefer open world or BGs, and if you wanna be a stealth assassin or a wrecking ball
---
Rogues solo and warriors in a group
---
Which one? The one that said it was on the 12 or the one that said it was on the 14?
---
No mara?
---
It wasnt just ninjaing a blue, he litterly kicked someone else in order to get it for himself
---
Thats what you get for rolling rogue bruh, just a fury warrior with less dps, less utility, less hp, less armor, cant tank dungeons or offtank raids, not as good in pvp with a healer,  just less. And now your only plus side, being able to stealth and backstab is rendered irrelevant.  You still have 3 days to reroll and get to 60 tho.
---
Lock it to factions or don't, but make sure the restrictions are properly published so people can make informed decisions.
---
Not saying anything then changing your mind halfway through is pretty inexcusable.
---
BRD xp runs by mages are very common actually. OP should have been told before going, but this def is going on on other servers as well
---
Yeah it was.  I'm just saying it's technically possible to "break" spy if they wanted to while keeping details etc.
---
Remember back in vanilla most of the addon communication fuckups were because they used actual chat channels to communicate.  So someone could join that channel and spam shit to fuck it up or whatever.  That can't happen now as in the modern client there is an api for addon communication between players which is far more robust.
---
They do not provide coordinates, they provide your position. 
---
Carbonite would put a dot on your map, but since it's been remade for classic, it does not have this feature. At the moment, all Spy does is say "There is an enemy around here."
---
If that's too big of an advantage, I really don't know what to tell you. People are acting like the add-on lets you auto-find and kill players with the push of a button when really all it does is give you information.
---
No loot drama at all so far in my guild. Cepgp is working really well. No one seems to feel left out so far. Only problem is that very few warrior weapons had dropped so far, but the warriors seem patient. Most people in the guild being 30+ probably helps.
---
If you have friends, and ones a healer, then warrior, hands down no contest.
---
If you're solo in the world, and not too into bgs, then rogue, as long as you have your CDs.
---
This was my exact thought. The front door...right in front of the bank and AH, where ***literally everybody*** congregates in Org. This doesn't even sound like a population issue, but just a dumb leadership decision. Take the side entrance and it's EZ entry.
---
I guess you were one of the ones waving and shouting. Check out my post about the NK raid. I grabbed a cool screenshot.
---
elsewhere he posts a different video, dude DOES have a valid problem... but he's communicating it like a child and incorrectly assuming everyone is impacted. 
---
He pops the action, and it's about 3 seconds before his toon actually exits combat and does the animation. it's way weird. may be addon related. may be his server. definitely not a universal problem for all hunters tho
---
dkp?
---
Notice how mage only has frost spec on that site as a choice? If so, what in the fuck are **you** talking about?
---
Fight = 3 minutes
---

Oh nice, I just naturally assumed it was tomorrow with the phase 2 patch. Kinda odd they say Phase 2 is the 12th..... but then don't release the Phase 2 features till the 14th..... 
---
Thanks for the info though!
---
Cannot add to opposite faction players.
---
Looks like a class 5 Shiticane.
---
Yeah, because what I do in my spare time is clearly a good reason for Blizz to not fix a bug. You donkey.
---
How braindead can the blizzard devs be honestly? People were saying alliance were gonna mass transfer off heavy horde servers since they announced this transfer and yet they still brought it out and made it horde only transfers halfway through. They split up alliance guilds and friends for no reason so stupid lmao.
---
Stay in MC cause out in the world you are free honor kills lmao
---
Yeah hang on let me jerk off in BRD for the 9000th time just to progress the chain. Brb. Oh and also let's pretend it was 2004 again. No thotbot, no wowhead and no Alakazam. How do you even fucking continue the attunement when you're literally given no clue where to find the winterspring npc? Horde have no such synonymous situation. They're hand held and told where to go and what to do the whole way through. Assymetry cannot be balanced and fair.
---
Currently Shazzrah is around 35% alliance and 65% horde. [Source](https://ironforge.pro/servers)
---
Because you miss out on MC/Onyxia, faster runs due to higher levels.
---
HoJ has a 5% chance to drop, doesnt take long. I am farming it for miltiple guild mates and it usually takes an evening or two.
---
Oh interesting, see that‚Äôs the thing I like PvP but just like... when I want to PvP lol. If I‚Äôm trying to collect 7 rat tails or whateverthehell leave me alone lol
---
Shoot I completely forgot this comment chain was on r/classicwow and not r/wow, my bad! I keep mixing up the subreddits as they get so similar with some overlapping content
---
&gt; That said, I could still work with it, the macro would allow you to get the trap off despite the exiting of combat being unpredictably delayed.
---
It wouldn't if you or your pet gets hit during that delay.
---
&gt;you have a valid concern, your mistake is insisting that this is a problem with feign death and not something with your server/connection/addons etc...
---
My guy the forums are full of people reporting this.
---
Spy was a thing in vanilla.
---
LFG tool is bringing retail functionality into classic, because we don't have the actual vanilla client. Which is why it was broken.
---
OK boomer.
---
That's....exactly correct.  This punishment DOES fit the crime.
---
Also, he didn't ninja....he kicked someone else who clearly wanted it so that he could have it for himself guaranteed (and failed, since he was too stupid to know it didn't work that way).
---
Amen to that dude. I'm so sick of it. We are as of last count roughly 83% to 17% ratio. This is ignoring sub level 30s and inactives. Before anyone questions me, you can check yourself. Log on and /who any contested zone at any time of the day. It's always going to be 4 to 1 at best. Winterspring had 39 alliance level 60s in it earlier to horde having 4. A zone right beside horde's hub and far as hell from alliance's main city is still that badly dominated. 
---
So I really have no pity for those who tried to come here. As mean as that may be. This server didn't need them. Horde already have to take an hour to corpse hop to BRD at peak time. Horde already can't level at all in many zones due to it being literally impossible. I don't get why these alliance didn't just roll on a PVE server.
---
2. And only got lucky while leveling. Zero while actually trying to find them. After layer is gone it will be completely impossible.
---
People keep forgetting that 85% of the population only plays for roughly 3 hours once a week on Tuesday.
---
And Paranoid was left in (the vanilla spy)
---
What I am trying to show you and others who think knowing an enemy is near you in a contested area is that it's not nearly as broken as you think. There is no direction, there is no "auto target", you still click their name, there is no arrow that leads you to them, there is no auto-cast a spell. All it does is show you an enemy is nearby. That's really it. Compared to what there was in vanilla, that's pretty basic.
---
I'd imagine whichever one one is dated more recently.
---
I've went through it with damage values higher than what we currently have. There's not a single mob that can crit a tank to death in one hit in any raid that I know off.
---
BWL is largely a joke. Only boss I can think off that outputs any sort of damage on the tank is Broodlord - which ironically druids do better than warriors, since they absorb those huge Mortal Strikes much better.
---
Neither warriors nor druids get oneshot while tanking. Warriors are better at handling periods with high incoming damage, due to having actual defensive cooldowns - and they can generate higher threat while dual-wielding in really good (aq/naxx) gear. Druids are right in the middle between mitigation and threat generation - except for Phase 1, where they're stronger than warriors in every way except for a fear break.
---
I don't know how fast or slow I was compared to other players. Within my guild I was the 12th person to hit 60 and that took me about 3 weeks.
---
Dude just lvl up again , the longer you put it off the worst it going to be... start doing it before you reach lvl60 and start raiding n gearing up
---
Turn all sounds except for "Sound effects" off
---
You can go in and see what spells theyre casting, genius.
---
Like a commenter here said, the name is borderline,if they gets people to report it enough, they might be "forced" to change it.
---
You're right for the wrong reasons. They should have changed this AGES ago! Theres no point being on a PvP realm if the faction balance is 80/20 or similar.
---
Well that's because you're running on 4k...
---
Your framerate must be awful. 
---
People underestimate how much power is required to run any game well high at 1440p/4k even a less demanding game like wow classic.
---
@OP whatever you choose, with that budget I would highly recommend making sure whatever laptop you buy has a 1080p resolution not higher. You can get laptops like this comment here for less than 1000 that have 4k screens but they will run any game horribly at that resolution and down scaling always looks wonky.
---
The only Alliance favoured PvP realm right?
---
Loot council is weird like that.  It‚Äôs easy to give them impression all the loot is being funneled to the officers, but those people are also the ones putting in all the effort, and you don‚Äôt want to give stuff to someone who‚Äôs going to bail the first time they don‚Äôt get what they want.
---
Yeah it's only recent news to me too. Good for my friend who is low 50s to get another level or two at least :)
---
Crazy fallacy. I think the reality of it , is you refuse to listen to anyone even if they agree and try to help you, just like most LoL toxic scumbags.
---
Ehh I am quick to toss a vote on posts usually before I finish reading the whole thing because I can easily change my choice later. It's pointless, there's an extra unnecessary click there, but its a habit I don't really care about breaking
---
I also downvoted the second I saw the title, but then upvoted when I read the description
---
People that have something to complain about will voice their complaints more often than people who are content in their situation.
---
It's obviously Blizzard's fault you chose a PvP server while knowing about the phases and your schedule.
---
Rogue is more fun by far as a solo player.
---
Warrior is only nice when extremely geared and pocketed. But this applies more to BGs as you dont generally have a pocket healer when doing random shit in open world.
---
Well you are welcome to add me, and we can form groups together. In game name; Actheleon. Our guild is also actively recruiting, &lt;Rage&gt;. Hope to see you on the server!
---
Rofl. Says the guy who just entered the thread to flame and ask why people are still playing.
---
It obviously depends on the guild, theres a guild out there no matter your style/attitude/specc/etc
---
yes
---
As long as we stay winning and y'all stay losing, we good.
---
Demonshear for sure.  Bigger MS plus sword spec proc FTW.
---
When you get 2 crit sword spec proc you‚Äôre going to have a joygasm.
---
Doesn't happen to me on fairbanks.
---
Mine's named "Gooby". I love this feature. It's so funny.
---
Harpy: "I will tear out your innards and desecrate your soul, Gooby!"
---
Yeah they're at 90 right now on incendius, glad I farmed up so many! 
---
Inspired by OP who hit like 700 before I even hit 200 :(
---
You are not legally allowed, nor would we want, to charge for addons or any third party content represented in-game as expressed in the Blizzard ToS.
---
We strive to provide our content in the way we feel it is best suited and will continue to do so.
---
It's people in these massive 500v500 battles crashing the server.
---
He picks a large majority of his lotus, this dude is the Lordus.
---
I'm actually not 100%, I know its something to do with Gnomeregan. I have other people with the recipe make it for me.
---
Speed clearing MC is fun lol, idk what you're talking about.
---
Pretty much every raid is run throughout the entirety of the game in every phase. BRE is still arguably the best 2h weapon you can have for pvp as a warrior. Onslaught girdle MIGHT get replaced in Naxx, if you're lucky.
---
Imagine being salty about other people enjoying a game. The fuck is going on.
---
What is this?? Are you talking about Savory Deviate Delight?
---
Aye, just realised i seen this dudes ytube videos and some twitch clips. Gg wp i guess
---
Hunter down ranked aim shot?
---
ok thanks
---
Omg...This man will never have to farm another mob for the entirety of WoW Classic if he transfered to most any other server. 
---
That's 900 individual units of black lotus right there. 900 x 120g which some people have reported gives potential 108,000 gold. Jesus
---
What are some of the best/safest place to grind throughout the 50s? Just about to hit 51 and not looking forward to phase 2. I'm a dps so unfortunately finding dungeon groups is incredibly difficult because of the severe lack of tanks. 
---
Slowly leveling a tank alt when I'm needing a change of pace but wanting to get my lock to 60!
---
Yeah there's a reason Onslaught is regarded as one of the best Horde guilds in the world though , and that's exactly why 
---
Can't blame em really, they wanna no life it hard and I respect that.
---
doing that quest yourself is one of, if not the most rewarding moment in vanilla as a hunter. 
---
Paying someone else to do it is just sad
---
You don't accidentally become R14 because you have no self-control. I'd argue the opposite. You need almost inhuman amouts of self-control to make it that far. 
---
Anyone who wants to achieve something outstanding in their life needs to make sacrifices elsewhere. This is accepted in other contexts as well and nothing to get hysteric about.
---
Yeah anything I didn't learn from my own lotus hunting experiences I learned from his vids
---
ditto
---
&gt;no servers are as lopsided either direction as heartseeker

---
Also my comment was more directed towards the limp wristed PVE alliance players who couldn't handle STV in the first 2 weeks on a **PVP** server.
---
How on earth do people get to 60 in 8 days played?
---
My played is 6.5 days and I'm on 48.
---
I feel like I have done fairly minimal afk / pvp and other wasted time. I used questie and avoid group quests if nobody is around for them.
---
And you both are probably neither
---
I guess I stand corrected about providing player coordinates. I‚Äôve used those coordinates to find a player that I would have otherwise not known about, but if it‚Äôs really just giving me my coordinates at the time Spy spotted that player, I suppose it was just a coincidence. 
---
&gt; People are acting like the add-on lets you auto-find and kill players with the push of a button when really all it does is give you information.
---
The flip side of this are the people acting like it confers no advantage at all, and that the same thing can be achieved with some customized combat logs. Both sides are being disingenuous.
---
You're very welcome. We're happy to be of use to you!
---
Bad avice.. if you DoT another druid they will jusr cat form and destroy you because hibernate will break
---
I see this reasoning all the time, but I just don't get the idea behind it. Isn't weapon damage what matters the most as an arms warrior? HoR has currently the highest avg weapon damage in game, yeah mace spec suck balls but you gonna get the extra attacks through windfury and hoj anyway. Also BRE proc is pretty much useless in any PvE scenario.
---
Same, i was prty happy with my 2 stacks of bl until i saw this tho xD
---
Please explain how the use of an addon is "abuse"
---
DBM lets you literally predict damage and pop the necessary cooldowns and potions needed to avoid it if your gear is too low to survive. Threat meters allow DPS to NEVER pull aggro from the tank, something that could easily wipe a raid. All of these addons, including spy, do the same thing. Pull data from your combat log and put in an easy to digest format. Same with recount, so if you're using ANY type of damage meters to see your miss % or highest crit, you're "abusing" addons.
---
Obviously there intent wasn't to let alliance through for the first 2 hours.  Are you really that dense?
---
That's awesome.
---
There'll be a second attempt, wouldnt call it yet for P1. Still few days to go
---
That's the thing. I wish people were a bit more humble and constructive in trying to fix in an issue.
---
A wise man would tell you that the battle is often decided before it even begins. That same wise man would also tell you there are better things to do with your time.
---
LOL the arms....
---
Thanks for the information. That is helpful
---
If it isn't a melee spec, then why does it:
---
- Give parry chance
---
- Increase Critical Strike Chance of Mongoose Bite and Raptor Strike
---
- Have cooldowns that increase dodge and parry chances
---
- Give you a counterattack ability (called 'Counterattack') with a melee weapon based on if you parry an attack or not, kind of like Revenge minus the Block
---
- Improve melee and trap only CC moves like Wing Clip
---
That seems pretty melee oriented to me. Yes, it has a focus on traps and its level 40 talent is a new Sting, but the majority of its talents augment the defensive and offensive effectiveness of a Hunter's melee abilities. It gives the Hunter boosts to dodge and parry, which only occur in melee combat.
---
Survival seems absolutely like a melee spec. If you are going ranged as a Hunter, choosing Survival seems really, **really** silly.
---
It's all subjective. What sounds better to you? Go with that.
---
I currently main a 60 Holy/ Prot Pally on Thunderfury and I mained a Prot Pally back in BC/ LK days. There is no disputing that Prot War is the single best raid tank. And that Fury War is probably always going to be top 3 damage in a raid. What I would say is that if you are looking for versatility then Pally is only rivaled by it's counterparts the druid/ shammy. Pally can play any role and with some pally items they can be viable as either a tank or healer or dps/tank. 
---
Pally is very versatile and fun to play in my opinion, especially as you level up as a Ret pally and are capable of topping DPS charts on dungeons and being able to farm quests pretty quickly to get to 60 fast (You have heals/ sustainability and DPS to make soloing fast. As well as a free mount at 40 and a cheap one at 60). 
---
But the main point of a pally is to be a versatile support role that can deal DMG, buff the team with great stats, heal/ off tank and use CD's to win a fight in a pinch. They are jack of all trades and masters of none (although I out healed all raid priests in MC last night ;P)
---
It's an addon that gives you information you wouldn't have without it. Because no one has the ability to look throught the combat log while farming to see if people stealthed. It's without a doubt on par with the examples I gave.
---
In vanilla it had addons like spy lol  
---
Why are people cringing about this? The only thing that spy does better is to Blacklist, though I still use vanakos to blacklist enemy and my faction..
---
And you sir is what is wrong with the world when people do things for free you take the piss. Get out of here asshat.
---
This community is the most delusional one I have ever seen. Most people here seriously think blizzard fucks up everything and its only due to the virtue of the community when something good happens.
---
Dude ya seeing his 1000+ BL made me wanna stack em
---
Grats on the two stacks, that's still plenty ! Last night I just finished stack number 11, and I'm pretty fuckin proud tbh
---
EU version?
---
Right exactly
---
Awesome how fast you can go! That was a very expensive run though. I‚Äôm not paying 200+g for a flask to go an hour faster.
---
You feel that Randy? The way the shit clings to the air? It's a shit blizzard.
---
Then do that. Using software to do it is automation.
---
I don't know what the big deal is,  just sleep all day and level at night ;)
---
And no one enjoys dying to a boss that doesn't have any mechanics to learn. Garr is literally not hard, you either banish your target as it comes off, hold threat on one of the golems that's not banished, and move away from the golem that's about to explode.
---
I would leave a guild that wiped more than 3 times on Garr. One or two wipes is expected for a lot of peoples first time in MC, because managing 9 total mobs can be hectic, but for 3 hours? Come on.
---
cry more
---
Only Blizzard is capable of giving a community exactly what they asked for while simultaneously fucking it up worse than anyone could imagine and turning it into a PR disaster.

Hi! okay i have the same freaking question. 
---
Apparently the pouch doesnt even work for a level 19 in classic!!! Ive been grinding rep for days to get this so this is a big whoops for me.
---
I was very confused about switching between 2h and 1h weapon, especially if switching to this pouch only gives you +4 stamina more if you cant use the pouch!!! i cant confirm the pouch doesnt work but ive read it in a few threads.
---
Does move speed stack with cheetah?
---
MS &gt; OS rolling is the only drama free system imo. But other systems work really well and without drama if done with the right group.
---
With how vanilla/classic was designed only about half the 40 man raid will get a piece of gear, and that's assuming every piece that drops is needed. So far stories I've heard from friends in other guilds are people are complaining that they have been in the raid 2-3 weeks in a row and not gotten a single piece. 
---
Sucks for sure when that sort of thing happens, but people need to learn that when you are one of 4-8+ people all doing the same thing, all wanting the same gear, and gear is scarce..... it's gonna take a long time to gear, and gear will be few and far between.
---
Luckily everyone in my raid team seems to understand this. We just have a good time raiding, joke/bs in discord while clearing, loot gets passed out, if you get something then cool, if you don't there is always next week. Not like the gear from MC is needed to clear MC, and we got at least a couple months before BWL comes out hopefully.
---
Natural selection at work.
---
hey idiot
---
look at the video and show me a video of you doing the same thing in classic
---
..you cant :D
---
spell batching is ruining classic and FD is proof

I'll take a video in an hour.  gotta drive home and install obs.
---
Locks can beat a feral druid without any pet out lol
---
and not everyone enjoys 2 day clears
---
I had this happen when we joint ran with another guild nothing better than leading a full Mc giving a 3rd or 4th OT is getting his 3rd piece. Needless to say first guild run I made up for my lack of loot and now we‚Äôre kinda round robin the drops between the first 3 tanks with me on priority because I‚Äôm MT every raid.
---
Yeah it ruins the element of surprise. There was NOTHING compared to this that was allowed in Vanilla. So why it's allowed now is beyond me.
---
r/justiceserved
---
Yes but only because I can't find anything that says it doesn't and I am noticably faster with my boots on.
---
strat live
---
I think you‚Äôve just gotten lucky with seeing them. Most people see 1 HoJ drop every 100-150 runs and most times there‚Äôs multiple people rolling on it. Though I see what your saying, getting to 60 ASAP is efficient cause then you can raid.
---
I mean, I don't mind once I get to 60. I'll take some PvP at 60 because those are the max-level memories I most want to re-live, anyways. 
---
It's just that, rn, when I'm on I wanna be leveling because I'm already getting impatient for max-level content which, for me, is mostly gonna be PvP and dungeons/raids anyways.
---
Ye MS&gt;OS works great until shadow priest offspecs gquit over healing rings. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre movinf away from rolls everyone can earn pints then spend on gear.
---
I had 700, had also bought some greens that showed as BiS alternatives.
---
I don't know the average. I didn't have any world drops and didn't focus on gold specifically but I did spend time grinding and did try to ensure any time I was grinding it was somewhere I could skin/dropped high raw gold so I guess I partly was making more than usual.
---
I have all the atlas loot addons, it only shows dungeon loot in the interface, not an actual map of the dungeon
---
Exactly. What heals you should use is the heal that will keep you alive while being as mana efficient as possible. Healing touch is more mana efficient, and you can even downrank it if you have the healing gear to make it more efficient than max rank.
---
Level 60 epic mount is 1000 gold (base rep) I think
---
Did you manage to reach 60?
---
You hear a beep when someone pops up on your list - he‚Äôs saying when his spy add on detects someone he stealths
---
2:09:00 for Saurfang
---
It‚Äôs good for enhance shamans though!
---
Wasn‚Äôt your fault leader failed to change loot type
---
Ok now officialy everyone forgot . No one care 
---
(Propably) and i wont find my mate
---
Well it's not 2004. There are multiple videos on wowhead showing you how to get to the npc without going in the cave. I played horde in vanilla, and the horde attunement was always considered the harder attunement chain.
---
If your raid team struggles to learn fights in MC other than Domo or Rag (and even them) then you won't make it very far past MC.
---
15 years of known data....tell me how devilsaur spawns haven't changed for 15 years. Or how warlock summoned infernals/doomguards haven't changed. or... or...should I continue?
---
tbf i dont know the origin i just saw it a lot on dota reddit
---
No one here has the true population numbers, only Blizzard does.
---
Whitemane's population is probably closer to 50-50 than any of the servers they listed up there.
---
It's fine. I miss shatter, that's a lot of fun on trash.
---
The buffs add a lot of dps on bosses.
---
And you end up aoeing on most trash now anyway. You just need to wait a bit before firing off.
---
Rogue lvl 56 does more dmg than paladin lvl 60. Acctually almost every class. They suck reaaaally bad.
---
Sometimes I regret not rolling on Faerlina just for longevity purposes. :(
---
Yea I used to feel like loot councils were bullshit, but it DOES take a bunch of effort to coordinate stuff. If people want to handle that, they get priority
---
Do the racial bonuses towards certain abilities not matter much? I see that the Trolls have an increase to Bow and Throwing, but if the bonuses aren't really substantial I may try the Orc out
---
I tip 15-20% of the mats cost.
---
thats clearly fuckin sarcasm. nobody is leaving majority horde server for minority horde server
---
Yeah, max-level pvp is something I'm definitely here for - no level discrepancies to fuck with the balance of the fight. Sure, gear issues, but I've made my peace with that and ain't gonna run from someone because of their T2. 
---
Idk if it was because of my guild's raiding schedule, or the age/size of the server when I was running MC, but honestly it was never burdensome to get to/in the raid on time in vanilla. But BGs were out then, so I'm sure that played into it.

I recommend warlock for 2 main reasons:
---
1.) Super easy to level solo while also providing plenty of utility for groups.
---
2.) Free mount
---
Yeah it's was EXTREMELY clear lmao like this shows what type of ppl we deal with on here lmao
---
It's more derp than drama.
---
Seconding Sulfuras. Very healthy server and the balance feels even.
---
Agro in classic is broken as fuck in general.
---
I've seen similar shit to this but not as bad, mobs taking a step or two after being attacked like nothing happened.
---
Also the whole "you were fighting near this person and they ran away so now you have agro from their mobs even tho u weren't in combat with them" is 100% non-vanilla like.
---
does + hit matter at all in pvp?

 does + hit matter at all in pvp?
---
Bruh if your can't figure that out then. God speed brotha
---
Druids can at least in theory perform every role. Hunters are the strongest class for solo leveling, warlocks probably archive best. Priests are annoying to level solo and with warriors you will probably die a lot, so don't pick one if that will frustrate you. But mostly pick a class that speaks to you with it's class fantasy
---
As the demand for arcanite bars increase, so does the transmute costs. It was 5g when no one needed them. Now that everyone wants lionheart, hand of rag, etc the price is gonna go up. Supply and demand.
---
Hell this was literally the quest that made me set up a macro to chain-cast Eagle Eye paired with a macro to target X mob and mark it with a skull icon. I had to eagle eye all over the entirety of the charred veil just so me and this mage I was with could figure out where the one earth elemental was and where the one whatever-the-hell harpy was since there were like 5-6 kinds and we needed one specifically.
---
How so? Spell power increases spell healing/spell damage but increases them both by less since it‚Äôs effecting both vs. spell healing increasing spell healing by more since it only effects healing. How‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt that make sense ? +30 spell power isn‚Äôt as strong/effective for HEALS as much as +30 spell healing would be.
---
TLDR; spell power isn‚Äôt as strong for healing as spell healing is. Yes, spell power increases your healing but not as much as pure spell healing does....
---
No he means that the Garr adds should randomly start exploding when Garr goes below 40%ish HP. Doesn't seem to happen at all in Classic.
---
1 mage in a raid? I'm lucky to get only 1 in a 5 man.
---
For a starter class I‚Äôd recommend hunter. They can escape combat, kill multiple mobs at once, avoid pvp situations, etc. 
---
Warlocks and mages are also very solid choices since they give you the utility necessary for you to recover when you mess up (which will happen often).
---
He quit already, i tried responding to his mail and it wouldn't send :(

not sure how accurate that site is.....

But death to water is a recipe that sells for like 1000g. Most people don't have it so that's not the issue.
---
The only solution is to buff the ever-loving hell out of the minority faction.
---
55-45 ? Minority gets a free 'Warchief/Lady Prestor's Token' that breaks all CC on a 10 minute cooldown.
---
60-40 ? Token now also gives you Track Humanoids, +5 to all weapon skills and +10 stealth detection. Minority Flight Masters/Quest Givers get Goblin Sapper Charges which explode for 3k area damage when they are killed.
---
65-35 ? Token lets you teleport to *inside* a dungeon, one use per 24 hours.
---
70-30 ? Guards report how many of the other faction are in a zone before you go there. Sapper Charges upgraded to 6k damage. Token now gives +25 stealth detection, and can be used to Stealth for up to 10 minutes with a 10 minute cooldown.
---
Tab and sunder?
---
You know us so well
---
It wasn‚Äôt like this in Vanilla and I rolled PVP servers from vanilla through MoP when I quit retail.
---
Racials don‚Äôt matter THAT much. Play a race that you enjoy looking at for hours on end.
---
Why not, if it‚Äôs a less populated server that can be far more beneficial than sticking to one over populated, even if you become part of the smaller faction
---
Omg I remember that post!!! One of the jewels of the original forums
---
What types of caracters have you enjoyed in other games?
---
I never played wow before and rolled a warlock because i always like casters and having a pet. Had alot of fun both leveling, farming dungeons and raiding
---
Also started a rogue(lvl 19 atm) since its very diffrent from warlocks and i think fury warriors and rogues look cool when they go ham in raids
---
They have the best in combat CC and best single target damage.  You can bring a mage I guess, if you like going slow through dungeons.
---
haha you better think again. there is no chill in this sub
---
Notoriously OP class beats notoriously underpowered class. ‚ÄúI gotta upload this to reddit! It‚Äôs my time to shine!‚Äù

It happened outside of WoW, GMs don't give 2 shits lol

It is challenging, you just don't like this kind of challenge.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs poor wording on my part. Outside of the custom sounds, that‚Äôs exactly what it is. 
---
You could spend a few hours tweaking combat logs and using notes to give yourself the same visibility and tracking that Spy provides. But regardless of whether you achieve it with Spy or on your own, my point is that it‚Äôs disingenuous to imply that this setup doesn‚Äôt put you at an advantage over people who don‚Äôt have it.
---
Holy shit well done dude.
---
They are full of shit tbh. Tons of guild rivalries out there that lead to some good pvp
---
It's always been the same, it says Cat. I tried to rename it but that didn't work. I am wondering if I made a mistake, named it nothing, and then it defaulted to Cat.
---
Thanks for that info though. I did not know you could only name a pet once.
---
Is it?  I guess I missed that memo.
---
Sounds like Hunter and Warlock are going to be the two main choices. I'll probably start out with Warlock and see how it goes. Thanks for all of the feedback.

From a pure single target fight that isn't long enough for you to run out of mana yes.

Exactly, the only way it could be libel would be if he had manipulated the image to show something that didn't happen but that doesn't appear to be the case
---
Good on you for making the right decision for yourself mate :). The game shouldn't feel that way! To get the most out of this game you need to be able to take it at your own pace and enjoy the parts you are currently engaging in. I understand the value of doing something in order to experience something else, but that shouldn't become the dominant motivator for the majority of your game time - you need to play the game *because you enjoy what you are doing,* with the content it will unlock later being the secondary motivation for the majority of what you do.
---
Leveling a character to 60 to 'keep up with everyone else' just isn't a good reason to play. Leveling a character to 60 *because you enjoy doing so* and because you want to raid is fine - but if you only have the latter motivation then you do need to think seriously about whether you should play at all. Playing wow is fun and I love it, but I play it *because I love it* not because I hope to love some other part of it later.
---
I hope you can come back later on and play the game for what it is and enjoy the parts of the game you are engaged in :).
---
What's your characters name üôÇ
---
Horde has more quests than alliance iirc, everything I've got in felwood/un'goro is too high at 49
---
Classic is a game for stoners bro don‚Äôt be surprised. Shoutout my fellow stoners
---
Overall I'd say rogues. Alot less gear dependent then warriors, and they are capable of very fun solo PvP.
---
Warriors are awesome in BG's/groups though so if that's what you want to do then go warrior all the way.
---
Well for 1) he ain't pulling 800+ dps.  2) No mage is either.
---
uh there is literally no benefit to being the minority of a 25 75 server
---
There was a blue post explaining that the Ally transfers that were allowed were due to a bug. Those characters were never intended to be eligible for transfer.
---
Hopefully Blizz does something to fix it.
---
Sound like a mediocre tank.
---
Warlocks are complex. Not a great choice for a first time WoW player.
---
Even when Blizzard makes a good change, they manage to screw it up. No communication? No warning? This is the kind of change you give a heads up at least a week before.
---
DUN DUN da da DUNN
---
Harassing someone for attempting to steal something from someone else is not wrong.
---
It's like they are actively doing everything they can to make Classic fail, lol.
---
Hey guys, I‚Äôm having a hard time deciding between a main. I‚Äôve been leveling a Hunter and Warlock and can‚Äôt seem to choose which one to main. 
---
My question is, can someone tell me how good hunters are in the earlier raids vs the later raids? Like are they best now or later. And also the same  question for warlock. Thank you!
---
Bruh last night I accidentally let the main take die on first pull cause I was stilll hacking from a shatter hoot gone wrong lmao.
---
 Heavy smoker my whole life, but one thing that irks me is being a stoner is an excuse for lacking even the smallest amount of effort.
---
Yes. Alt click any item slot you want to make it a button.
---
I haven't had issues but I always start drinking out of LoS either on the lower level or behind a pillar.
---
I haven't gotten a single gold spam whisper, only channel invites.
---
Whitemane feels incredibly well balanced. I've loved the server so far.
---
Are Horde really that insanely outnumbered on Heartseeker? I was thinking about rolling my Shaman alt on Heartseeker but now I'm not so sure.
---
People are now aware that he will attempt to steal anything of high value and that is somehow a bad thing? I mean, he ruined his own reputation by attempting to ninja a BoE blue item, he did this to himself, now we are just aware of it.
---
He was just salty I agree with what you said he was in guild a week we helped him farm hide of the wild mats and an eye. Needless to say we were glad his true colors showed up early now we can find someone that doesn‚Äôt want to randomly go shadow on raid days.
---
Oof.  There's a lot wrong here.  Baron cloak is not better than Rag cloak.
---
You are right. We can still read.
---
msg me how fast u quit that toon kinda curious
---
Arms feels really good, until you realize that you're eating after every mob and killing things far slower than fury. There's a reason what arms is meant for PvP and not used in raids. Dual wield leveling is discouraged because of the meta we live in. Fury is faster solo leveling, hands down. 
---
I speced into arms around 42 after getting camped in STV. It felt good to be able to actually  hold my own for the first time. Then I went back to questing. Half an hour later I hearthed and respeced back into fury because arms was so bad. I had the SM quest 2h at the time
---
Or tab and swipe
---
Haha I just meant that I can‚Äôt confirm if the original claim was factual, though I tend towards believing it was because man, what a wonderful fuckup from Pushmybush.
---
GM's are reversing xfers.
---
It's a safe overall assumption though. Most of the Horde I've spoken to on the topic are perfectly content with 3:1ing the alliance on Stalagg. Some say they'd have preferred a PvE server anyways and this gets them that, others I think like to have the world be a little less dangerous overall.
---
Personally I hate that when I go to Dire Maul I see 15+ horde and 0 alliance, or never fearing a wPvP battle. Maybe that'll change on Thursday but I'm personally ready to hit that transfer button. Unfortunately I'm the GM of a 300+ guild that mostly disagrees

Big flipping F on that crusader enchant, actually worse than beastslaying :D
---
I personally feel Anathema is in a good place, but I'm Ally so not too sure about horde perspective. I welcome all newcomers!
---
I hope this addon gets broken. I'm just a hunter ATM but it seems very much against the spirit of the game to know however many yards out how many enemy players are nearby, know who is stealthed, know if am I being attacked, have the addon auto-target them for me, etc.  without even looking around at all.
---
faction change? gtfo, this isn't retail.
---
Would love to see the results!
---
High Executor Derrington at the bulwark (horde) does, he asks you for some "veteran" help for a cauldron run. in a mail ofc.
---
Yeah I'd love a full list of your gear or some such! (shame Armory doesn't exist for Classic...)
---
Faction specific queues were the way to do it 2 months ago. Now it'd be pretty bullshit to spring that on people on the overpopulated faction. Blizzard just really, really sucks in the area of faction balance and has for 15 years. At this point it's negligence bordering on vandalism of their own product.
---
Online and active are different things. Sounds like a selfish guild if no one is willing to go through down for a friend

None of this streamer garbage. Kill it with fire.

"What doesn't work: Procs from weapon. Crusader, Fiery, Lifesteal and whatever works the same way."
---
During the SM phase I ran into just countless groups who insisted on AoE cleave or bust, even if we wiped over and over, nope that's the only way we're doing it or just drop the group. I saw some of that mentality still going into Uldaman. I think it was around Maradoun where I started to see that vanish.
---
Then by the time BRD came around with all the arena/anger endless runs, not really much of the whole AoE cleave thing anymore, at least not the way it was with SM.
---
Not to say that there aren't ample opportunities to AoE...oh there's still tons - but the whole AoE or nothing mentality has thankfully gone out the window. And along with that, the whole tanking with a 2H too, thank god(a story for another day).
---
You see this is why no one is taking this seriously.
---
You are complaining about something the addon DOES NOT DO.
---
It DOES NOT TARGET STEALTHED PLAYERS.
---
ITS TELLS YOU WHEN SOMEONE STEALTHS IN RANGE OF YOU.
---
Someone stealth from mines and moved to farm cap won‚Äôt trigger the addon.
---
someone stealths at farm cap while you are there? It tells you someone used stealth.
---
This addon isn‚Äôt some ‚Äúwallhack‚Äù stealth cheat. Jesus christ you people.
---
Damn, looks like we found the salty paladin in here. This is not me streaming and I don't play mage, I play... Paladin. Also, my name isn't edgie its three initials and two numbers. So, go be salty somewhere else, your acting like a ding dong.
---
I was able to readjust the position of ExtendedCharacterStats in the LUA Files by changing the value of the position variables. You might want to look into them if you're a bit familiar with code, since it probably does something like Time+ChatType+Name+Message
---
Can you not
---
Moving horde from horde imbalanced servers to alliance imbalanced servers is the definition of addressing the imbalance. 
---
Sure, allow everyone to transfer, AND implement the queue system. Good luck every alliance that just transferred to heartseeker. Enjoy your 10 hour queue. Good fix there buddy.

* Serrenia/Spoh(S2) was Rdruid/War
---
* Serrenia/Neilyo(S3) was War/Rog
---
* Chumpjohn/Entrepid (S4) was Rduid/War
---
Well played druid had no real issue surviving mage/rog before the warrior could kill one of them.  War just has to save trinket for blind and it was an easy fight.  
---
I played Rdruid in arena from S3-S12, multi-glad, and twice over that time frame I had the highest rated 2's team in the world.  Perfectly played rog/mage could occasionally beat rdruid/war if they screw up, but 9/10 games if both sides played it well rdruid/war is going to win.  It wasn't by chance that rdruid/war was rank 1 in the most competitive BG and mage/rog never was.
---
Any way to see the current server balances atm? I  found one from a while ago but it's not recent.
---
Yeah we need you to go restro
---
My alt just hit 59 and I am sprinting to 60 (haha rogue joke)
---
Well, probably, but as a mage, and frostmage especially, I always have a fighting chance of getting away - especially if I'm close to guards. In this case I was near camp Mojache in Feralas.
---
It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a bad imbalance, but ally always outnumber horde when PvP breaks out. It‚Äôs not like 2 to 1 though it‚Äôs more like 1.5 to 1.
---
It's not even that speed clearing is fun so much as spending 6+ hours doing something you could have done in 1 isn't very fun.
---
I feel like i've heard this story before. The whole "+1" rolling system just doesn't make sense to me. People will either be pissed they can't roll, pissed they saved their roll and didn't get something/regret not rolling, or they'll win something then leave because they know the chances of everyone else getting something that raid just so they can win another item is slim to none.
---
If you are gonna do +1 stuff you should really consider creating something like "wings" for MC. Like break it into 3-3-3-1. Where loot resets each "wing". Create incentive for people to stay. Sure someone may get super lucky and win something each wing, but it's RNG, that person will be super happy for the night, and people who lost only can blame RNG and may have a good night later on just like that person did.
---
Or a different option would be to do a MS&gt;OS roll system where you can still roll after winning something, but your roll get a automatic reduction to its value. Like -15 or whatever value seems fair for the guild.
---
Speed clears are extremely fun to pull off
---
Yeah, so a little bit more than expected, but not by that much.

I guess it depends on you but if you prefer the lore/looks of a character i'd base more on that than which class is considered the easiest. Everything except warrior and paladin will be easy enough to level any way for a noob if you spec correct.

The odds aren't even close on Stalagg as it is on Heartseeker, gimme a break lmao
---
hunters are great now and fall off later
---
warlocks are not great now but are amazing later
---
Love it. Where's that Ony RL when we need him?
---
Buncha noobs; same noobs bitching about queues and server issues when they were warned as well.
---
Wait until aq40
---
17 alliance vs 83 horde vs 80 alliance 20 horde. pretty sure thats close
---
Fuck em lmao
---
Idk about this site, my server is horde dominated but it's showing as 30% horde which is wildly incorrect.
---
Awesome summary, thank you very much! üòÑ
---
So I need to have my 5m cooldowns up to even stand a chance every fight meanwhile any class can kite me to death?  You really don't understand that stealth is literally 33% to 50% of rogues power do you?  Making it less effective with an ADDON is a unneeded nerf to rogues no matter how you look at it.
---
Let me give you an example.Me, rogue without stealth talents, uses stealth way far away from a human mage.Human mage pops perception and now has 2 minutes of god-like power to pull me out of stealth if I am anywhere within a stone's throw of him, which I probably will be because I was going to surprise him.  Oh, now he starts spamming rank 1 explosions all over trying to pull me out of stealth until he feels safe.  My opportunity was TAKEN away from me because of an addon telling him to act that way, not his skill or awareness.
---
Okay. That makes sense. Thank you for giving me actual info. I don't have a bone slicing hatchet, and im a dwarf. Should I use flurry axe or mirah's in raid. MH is Axe of Deep woods.
---
If you care about racials, troll.
---
&gt; The what happened pane would be fine as it would log the event as it happened to you.
---
Not with what the guy I responded to suggested:
---
&gt; You can keep combat log data for allies, remove it for enemy players.
---
What if enemy players did not produce combat log entries unless you were in combat with them?
---
And they probably send them all back if they put in a ticket. But better going to Reddit and throwing insults at Blizzard.
---
Ya I'mma just play retail, I might come back to it at some point but it's just not fun for me rn
---
127g each on my server u have 920 of them = alot of gold
---
Oh, most recently I think it was about 10-15 minutes. They‚Äôre always in ranged like that, but usually not longer than 20 minutes.
---
Have you tried TellMeWhen for the proc icon? I haven't used it for that specifically but it has a lot of options, I'd be surprised if it can't do it.
---
Except I left Stalagg because I wanted a good balance. It's not on me. I left when HS was low pop and no one wanted to come here. Blizz finally came to their senses though so now I know there won't be anymore alliance swarming HS to zerg.
---
What is that supercool chat add-on you use
---
Yeah it's really that "10 days played to 60!" that throws it off. I have 2 60s and their total combined time to 60 is 10.5 days. You'd have to try really hard to get it over 8 days.
---
Bruh who knows if we will even be playing by p 5-6 let alone be alive still. People on this sub will be gone by then
---
what you invested in ?
---
Remote desktop into queue homie
---
Nah dude, you're good! Speaking from someone else in the raid, I don't think anyone thought twice about it once you stated what happened and then immediately posted a screenshot. GM even complimented everyone not using that chance to ninja lol. I wouldn't sweat it!
---
Poisons have charges and will drop once these are used up.
---
Ye dw, I'm lvl 51, sitting in UC playing the AH until phase 3.
---
I'll slowly level an alt while u guys enjoy ye WPvP ^^
---
I mean how much are you really willing to spend on something when you know theres something out there better? It's just an intermediate step
---
What are you talking about? Just playing the game?
---
Spy so we can get an embargo on Spy whining threads after everyone starts crying about it.
---
What kind of work do you do and how much does it pay lmao
---
I got it for 200g, so by my own calculation I have still saved 100g+! Fuck yeah!
---
Make it an add-on or other people will repurpose your content? Offer a better service than people who steal your content?
---
Wrong. I took a level 55 mage to a jump run and he didn't aggro anything.
---
Well before raiding u gotta run dungeons to get your pre-raid gear, then raids. But there's also PVP coming soon with Battlegrounds in a future update. You could also focus on making money, this time around we have the benefit of knowing exactly what content is coming in the future, so there's a lot of money to be made by farming items that are not useful now, and holding onto them until future updates when they will be worth much more. 
---
I guess with the game in it's current state, there's not much to do at max level once you are able to farm both raids each week. But future updates will add lots more stuff, and you can level alts in the meantime.
---
10 in 2 days
---
Sure, but there‚Äôs absolutely a benefit to being on server that‚Äôs not crammed
---
this just means you've never been good enough to notice the skill difference
---
send stalagg some of your alliance pls
---
Yep especially if you have the improved hit chance on poisons. The lower tier ones don't have many charges. 
---
Most of the time your mainhand will blow through charges before your offhand is even halfway
---
Hell yeah brother!
---
I had a similar experience on some  p servers. Once you hit 60 everything flips on its head. Finding groups, items, the right guilds, etc is so easy and smooth that it's like dream.
---
Get 60 and send me a message of how it feels afterwards
---
&gt; Because you miss out on MC/Onyxia
---
Those raids aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
---
Meanwhile while you deplete all your health and resources killing black bears, some asshole runs up and tags all the grey bears that just spawned
---
no? not really. unless you just want to play a single player wow
---
Cool we should all make posts when someone we know quits that‚Äôll add lots of quality content to the sub.
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal
---
I mean, it‚Äôs not, I just wanted to reference a recent meme in a desperate attempt at relevance
---
How do you do, fellow kids?
---
Uh, what you say may be true, but MS is not used in raid because of the debuff limit, not necessarily bc of damage.
---
(Not saying MS is more damage than fury, but (at least from my experience in vanilla), MS can be competitive raid dps is a semi-casual guild (Nef killed) -- and with classic content being easier than vanilla, this is even more true.)
---
There are going to be plenty of MS warriors and dagger rogues killing Rag starting like this week. And they will be fine till AQ at a minimum.
---
It does get harder but it depends on your class too. If you‚Äôre Hunter it‚Äôll be easy for you pretty much the entire time
---
link me yours
---
I do work and it pays money lol
---
but then you're in danger of a situation where you can't get your friends to join your sever later
---
Well it is flaired as humor
---
Reportedly 83% - 17? Wait until last day of transfers and check the balance.
---
Now they need to actually spend a little money and fix the damn servers so we can pvp in large groups.
---
Your fooling yourself and not convincing anyone if you think your going to do the same thing without the addon. Just sit there and read every line of combat log yeah? sure man...
---
Yes it gets harder.  Still not very hard but people are dumb so
---
The way it was announced was terrible, but otherwise this is the right move. Are alliance players expecting Blizzard to give free transfers just so they can change to a better ratio realm? That doesn't make any sense.
---
They either have to stick it out, re-roll, or wait for paid transfers. Same options as before the announcement
---
BRE proc is insane for PvE if your guild isn't using annihilator, and most guilds aren't using it at this point. BRE procs on average 3 times per minute, meaning that you'll have a 50% uptime on the armor debuff, which will add a substantial amount of damage than way more than makes up for the lower top end on BRE. Additionally mace spec is fucking useless.
---
Use mirah's
---
Cause queue time, lag, competition of resources aren‚Äôt issues?
---
Big Servers are crashing due to the load of players on them,  how is that not an issue?  You can argue that it‚Äôs less of an issue that being on the underside of faction imbalance, but you can‚Äôt argue it‚Äôs not an issue
---
This is awesome !
---
But according to most people here, pservers don‚Äôt ever lag in massive PvP battles and thus are far superior to classic.
---
I‚Äôm a shadow priest and people keep saying  ‚Äúoh no one will want a shadow priest soon‚Äù but I‚Äôm struggling to see why not, unless it gets like tenfold harder. Because otherwise I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt just take anyone who is just a somewhat competent player. Obviously speed runners and world firsts have their reasons but for the sake of just doing the content.
---
AR is far from dead on the Horde side, i wish i could just make up facts to make my rants seem viable.
---
What do you mean by "Kite around in bear form"? Druids have no slows.
---
That's a solid choice tbh.
---
Get what ya deserve for coming to an already Alliance-skewed server.
---
Not really. That is kinda the point of Horde. We are the "hardened" races. 
---
As "lush" as it gets for horde are the shared zones: STV, Feralas, Un'Goro, Arathi. Everything else will be wasteland/blight style areas.
---
Good.
---
It‚Äôs really not untrue. It‚Äôs a 4% drop rate. The VAST majority don‚Äôt see a HOJ every 20 runs. You‚Äôre likely to see one drop every 80-100, unless you get lucky.
---
Well I am raiding as a shadow priest and have been for weeks, we have like 6 warlocks in our  raid comp and I do respectable dps myself. No where near as bad as was made out. Sure they could just dump me as soon as we hit the next raid tier but I doubt it. I am often asked to simply dispel however, but that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm utility.
---
Please take down this post as per u/classicwowlive 's request
---
Ty
---
Glad you're sticking with it! I've already MTed all of MC, just haven't recorded it. Next one i'll be sure to share.
---
The difference is marginal, troll is slightly better for PVE but orc is better for PVP. Play whatever is pleasing to you! I‚Äôd say the most impactful race/class combo is dwarf priests. Each race of priests has an spell unique to that race. Dwarf priests get fear ward, which is a powerful spell.
---
You missed the part where they completely fucked it up, apparently.
---
I thought it had coordinates?
---
Anyone know which add-on will show healing amount as combat text? I‚Äôm a Holy spec Paladin and just trying to get it to show the amount I‚Äôve healed above each party member just like damage is shown in yellow.
---
They can transfer back.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/having-trouble-with-a-transfer/360631/9
---
IMO there are really on 3 parts of this fight that could fuck you up.
---
Warlocks cant keep up banish targets properly so adds get loose.
---
Tanks failing to tank the adds and they get loose.
---
Melee dont listen to call outs to get back from exploding adds.
---
Definitely stay Alliance if you want pretty leveling areas. Take undead as an example. Super big open fields with few props/asthetics.
---
Mulgore maybe
---
They weren't starting a raid... They were just griefing people.
---
Please build one yourself.
---
With that money you can build something solid, and can pick and choose to tailor your needs.
---
If you want extensive help researching/building feel free to pm me and I can talk you through it
---
Let me guess, you use cast bars? Its the same info provided, but I guess you'd never know when to kick otherwise.  Combat log readers is basically how most mods work.  If you think stealth shouldn't be listed in combat logs, then spells shouldn't either and name of the person attacking you.  Seems to me you're just getting into the game, and are discovering things about the game that were here 15 years ago and now your getting a little informed about it.
---
It is BiS until later phases for feral tanks
---
Good news, they can come back.
---
i came here to see if anyone wrote this one. I thought the funniest thing was there was you needed less of the mobs there were a lot of and more of the mobs that had like 2-3 spawns.
---
I'm a horde (who never played wow before classic) so care to explain?
---
Awesome
---
Honestly I've mostly just wiped on accidental overpulls on MC trash and rarely on bosses.
---
World chat is dumb, we dont care.
---
Yeah....coz karl malone wasnt called the mailman long before warcraft was a thing
---
Been in quite a few +1 raids at this point and people leaving after getting loot has never been an issue tbh. It's not like a big time commitment to stay the whole raid, and people don't want to get blackballed just to save an hour or two of their time.
---
No?
---
They just posted on the forums that people can have their transfers reversed if they were hit by this.
---
And this whole time I thought it was from basketball legend Karl Malone...
---
What in the world makes you think some dudes at Blizzard were scrolling through Reddit, saw that thread, said "Why haven't we thought of that?!?!", then pushed through a major faction transfer policy shift in a couple days?
---
Why? Hired machinima artist + a custom digital painting done.
---
So why didn't you answer what level you were?
---
Well he was right.
---
if they're 10 or more levels below you then no honor is awarded
---
I still dont understand how shamans dont have that reputation. You can be running around with a hunter, holy priest, mage, warrior tank, and shaman and have the shaman roll against each of the other players on something specific to their main spec.
---
Why would anyone buy a Black Lotus for 132 gold?
---
Warrior with a paladin behind him, nothing can top that feeling.
---
Give hunter a try - most fun I‚Äôve had in PvP for a long time. With traps, feign death and pet mechanics there is something just so satisfying about outplaying your opponent!
---
Lookingforgroup is a blizzard channel, world chat is a public channel with the people who first created it being in control on that server and is moderated by them.
---
How long did it take to gather all the buffs?
---
Full T1 geared hunter easily almost one-shot(Aimed+multi+auto) LV60 with shitty gear. I've done that countless times at AV.
---
1. The sub's users aren't one homogeneous group.  
---
2. People are more likely to speak out when something happens that they don't like.  
---
That's all there is too it
---
I wonder how many children Postmater Malown has?
---
The big reason for LH being better is the code was open source then. Lots of work was done to the code base post Nost.
---
Bad at communication. All they needed to do was tell people what was going on.
---
They SHOULD have announced that free transfers would be ending, left them off for a few days while announcing they'd start back up again as FACTION SPECIFIC transfers, then started them up when phase 2 dropped.
---
Instead there's an unannounced switch from one transfer system to another, which is going to cut people off if they're in the process of transferring.
---
Are they being this bad on purpose?
---
The hero we need.
---
Should be a bannable offense to have that add-on.
---
?? Arcane intellect is dealing ~ 260-290 damage per hit, cone of cold is anywhere from 380 to 500+ per hit depending on gear and talents, and that's before you factor in crits. Not at all unfeasible for a mage to hit 800+ dps on aoe pulls
---
I guess I'm just comparing to Skeram, which seems to have 5-10x the Horde population of Heartseeker. To me HS feels lifeless and dull. I spent 15 minutes on Sunday afternoon in lookingforgroup and world and saw maybe a dozen unique people posting during that time.
---
Notice how the person didn't answer what lvl he was. If the OP was a normal level for the dungeon, then it doesn't make much sense to not be allowed to loot unless it was discussed beforehand.
---
If the OP was lvl 40 and can't actually hit any mobs in BRD, then it makes perfect sense.
---
Faction specific queues would fix that very quick, if only 5K hordes and 5K alliance can log in then there won‚Äôt be any outnumbering, just massive queues for the overpopulated side.
---
 World chat is dumb, we dont care.
---
It‚Äôs too far gone from a vanilla experience to even compare them. Even if there were fewer people, it felt easier to find a group for a non optimal dungeon that has some good drops for you since everyone wasn‚Äôt worried about just spamming ZF spell cleave for max xp/h. Finding groups that want to kill tinkerer in Maura for some mage/pally BiS takes me much longer than finding a group to xp run ZF. 
---
And ok IF ain‚Äôt empty, but seeing 3 ppl at the mail box, 2 dudes afk, and 10 in the AH pales in comparison to IF on Faerlina or other higher pop ally servers. And what about alliance in contested areas? There are such few alliance in gadgetzan and booty bay because you can‚Äôt go afk for 2 seconds without getting ganked. Which I wouldn‚Äôt really complain about, but idt I‚Äôve ever seen enough alliance group up in those spots to kill off the gankers on top of the arena and fuck with some horde.
---
That's a wipe!
---
It is BiS.
---
dueling as a mage hurrrr
---
World chat is dumb, we don‚Äôt care
---
this argument is pretty dumb imo because no one actively looks at their logs for people showing up or stealthing/unstealthing. you do realize priests have macros where they just use mind vision as soon as their addon pops and instantly knows where i am?
---
Nostalgia
---
Of course it‚Äôs going to seem low when you compare it to not only a horde skewed server, but one 3-4 times the usual server capacity. 
---
Also naw, those chats are always going off. Don‚Äôt exaggerate.
---
Spy 100%
---
this
---
TBH i didn't know it even existed on my server before this past weekend when people were complaining about it being locked
---
That‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm worried about. I keep seeing people slamming ret pally and It‚Äôs making me nervous. I really like what their gear looks like and I‚Äôm a fan of Paladins/clerics in lore. But I don‚Äôt want to play a healer
---
What a noob, no crusader enchant
---
Anything can be reported. Whether or not its actionable is another story.
---
I only have a single monitor so I use an "always on top" program that allows me to have a window on top of WoW so I can watch stuff while I play.   It made leveling/dungeon farming much more bearable.
---
It is horde biased. Kromcrush currently has free transfers off the realm for horde faction only.
---
Not allowed. The repeating would be a keypress without an actual keypress.
---
