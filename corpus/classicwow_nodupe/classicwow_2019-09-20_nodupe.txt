Can 2 priests use 2 renew spells?

Because you r not a have not.
---
I remember this one time a kid at my school got kicked in the nuts so hard he spit up blood. I didn't even know that was possible.
---
I mean, I don't see why people wouldn't run honey pots on dark net too. It's not like only bad guys have access to it.
---
Yes, alliance like to rely on guards when the going gets tough. They are so brave /s
---
Last guy got 1 year and a 30k fine. 4 years ago I think
---
+1 want to know, bump

---
Lmk if you found out
---
and i think you overestimate people's ability to give a fuck
---
A couple is two, a few is more than two. Like that movie A Few Good Men had Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson and Kevin Bacon. That's three.
---
Here's a little story from Ultima Online:
---
When the game was first designed, they created a virtual ecology. There were grazing animals that would eat the vegetation (which grew back over time) and predators that would eat the grazers. The idea was that the player would need to control how many of which animal they killed in order to maintain the ecological balance. Kill too many predators and the vegetation would disappear from over-grazing. Kill too many grazers and the predators would die out from no food.
---
When the game launched, every player immediately went around killing every animal they saw. It totally borked the virtual ecology, and the devs had to scramble to re-code the game and basically remove it.
---
TL;DR -- never give videogame players too much credit.
---
I always thought that my art and video games were incredibly normal together.  Everyone in my personal life that knows me as the guy that does art is not surprised by the fact that I play video games.  
---
I always saw the two as kind of going together.  
---
And I do fine art.  Landscapes and painting of flowers and shit.  
---
I am completely blown away by the idea of someone looking down on you for playing video games because you’re an artist.  
---
Good lord, I would show people pictures of my land plot in archeage all decked out with canvases of my artwork, that I sold in game, and they would get a kick out if.  Most of the people I would share that with don’t even play video games.  
---
I have an ex that was a proffesional photographer that thought it made perfect sense that I was a gamer.
---
1 - Blizzard (and the majority of the WoW Classic community, myself included) is strictly apart of the #NoChanges gang, so asking for this is like asking an ocean to dry up.
---
2 - Too few talents? Each tree for each class has 15-20 talents alone. Sure, some of them aren't the most exhilarating, but it's not like we're starved for choices.
---
2 - Too much level? Doesn't this contradict the "too few talents" thing? Too many levels would imply you have too many talent points to spend, and no idea how to meaningfully use them.
---
3 - Gun-wiedling Rogue already exists in retail in the form of Outlaw. If you want pure gun-based ranged Rogue... That's just a Hunter. Spellsword hasn't really been tried in WoW yet if you don't count Death Knights.
---
You mean blizzard and the police organizations that caught him? Because they sure as fuck think he did it. Ffs
---
Oh no people tried to be nice and help me out with an issue I voiced on a public forum. Get over yourself, you’re kind of a douche
---
Using the remotr app to remote into my desktop at home.
---
From what I've gathered rolling my first warlock the two rules are... stam = PVP, spell power = PVE. I'm saving a seconadry set of armor right now in preperation of phase 2.
---
As for BiS I'm currently [following this guide on WoW head](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow) 
---
Lastly - my wand is from [Jed Runewatcher] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12605/serpentine-skuller) which is a rare spawn in the 10 man raid UBRS. :-) Good luck on your adventures!
---
&gt; Blizzard Security Team worked around the clock with local and international law enforcement agencies to track down the source of the DDoS.
---
Yeah this is totally the same situation
---
That isn't against tos
---
30s vs 40s and skulls. Yes. Oh well. And the horde didn’t have the thought to not rush in. Smarter not harder.
---
Good thing I have my die move.
---
Something that says "leather daddy"?
---
Hot cigars and leather.
---
&gt;Well they aren't spamming heals for one.
---
That isn't something a ret does better than a holy pal.
---
&gt;I think they get a few improved seals that holy spec typically dont use, one of them can help with in-combat Mana Regen.
---
All paladins get seal of wisdom, and ret has nothing that improves the mana gained.
---
The reality is, you are better off bringing a holy pally that offers an extra buffer of healing than a ret that does less dps than a tank. It is just not a smart move to bring a ret paladin, period.
---
3 possible spawn locations on a 7 hour respawn timer
---
It's a rare mob with 1.0 attack speed. Pretty much the de-facto hunter pet in vanilla.
---
I never said anything about justifying, you can absolutely have whatever faction on whichever boss. But it clearly makes no sense for Alliance being the ones to take down Onyxia and I think it'd be cool if it was like that, but it's not like it's a big deal. You don't have to be so anal about everything.
---
mage
---
Just say “i’m new to tanking” and leave it there. I’ve been playing since Vanilla and have been doing that for every dungeon i’m in! 
---
They don’t need to know your new to the game nor does it matter. Don’t be discouraged - those are the kinds of groups I wouldn’t want to be in anyway. See if you can find a lvling guild to work with, a few friends around your level to team up with.
---
I'm almost sure if it was horde running around they would kill me asap. Very very rarely I met a high level horde that didn't decide to butt rape me as I'm walking with either full health, dieing from a mob or just left their horde pals alone when I could have killed them.
---
Oh, you're right -- I think, I haven't actually tested it in-game. In that case the damage difference between the sword and the axe is 25 points of damage, which assuming 400 attack power is about 10%.
---
It’s not tricking anything, its literally going to the computer to press the button, the very definition blizzard states is ok.
---
true. thats a really good point and it depends on the level range. the trend i have seen so far is that boe under lvl 40 are 90% of the time a vendor sell while on my current realm disenchanting of lvl45 and higher should net on avg a noticeable plus(up to 100%). i havnt done any calculations yet how cheap linen,wool, silk and mageweave/leathers affects the enchanting mat market, but there can be possible profits for certain shuffles.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i use auctionator and do daily scans. it shows me a tooltip with  % of what i can possibly get when i disenchant and how much on avg it is worthin the ah. technically i could scan for cheap greens which give me on avg x profit by disenchanting. 
---
another good income are cath runs, disenchant both blues once everyone is set gear wise, the shard is worth 4g on my realm and contribute them evenly since we run it so many time for the xp then use that gold to get other mats you need.
---
&gt; Forcing an expansion upon players does not delete all progress.
---
You've been lied to.
---
It's hard to see if you don't care about looking behind the “design” curtain, but [**there will always be a reset somewhere.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/d3u8mg/the_pyramid_progression_cycle_my_revised_thoughts/f05cae0/)
---
Sometimes it's really obvious, like when your purple epics that you struggled to get are so quickly replaced with green commons that a new player gets handed just by showing up. Other times it's trickier to see, like when talents and spells get slowly pruned over multiple expansions because of bloat and homogenization.
---
Attunement chains get quietly removed, XP requirements get nerfed. Don't be so blind, Dart. You've been living a lie of progression this entire time. Your character is the product of cleverly disguised reset after reset.
---
There will always be a reset somewhere. The only difference is whether you notice it or not.
---
Every month it seemed we got an extra day or two back then
---
I hope that piece you're looking for drops and you lose the roll to a warrior.
---
Idk if that was HIS or stolen/fake mail but even so.. we couldnt see that info for his twitter anyway.
---
Well, kinda, but no. Hacking is a term from frontiersmanship, when confronted with a difficult situation will you be able to overcome it:

And they only gank redridge because there are 8 level 50s in hillsbrad.
---
Damn that sucks :(
---
Question about Rogues and backstabs. Are they viable in pvp? and do they proc on bosses? Noob question never played Rogue but looking through the talents. Dagger spec seems to rely on backstab abilities.
---
Right quick math failed me 21 pts +10 level = 31 but there is effectively 21 levels of pts from 10 to 30
---
&gt;Given the massive success
---
But you already called it a success.. its to early to call it that. You need to realize that ALOT  players never played wow.. and they just tried it because of hype, and will quit very soon.
---
Blizzard know how to hype games
---
Classic got one big problem.. there will be never a update path, new content. Classic simple got no future, and this is really big thing from players perspective. Sure you can play with friends now, make few dungs, few raids.. but thats it.
---
I just watched the movie again few days ago
---
I have a warrior friend who cheered at an alli hunter taming Broken Tooth. As soon as he tamed it, he killed it and then killed the alli. I just hope the fucking thing didn’t run away because when you take them they’re already at minimum happiness. Fuck
---
Classic+ will never happen until naxx is out and over. So probably don’t have to worry about it not being the endgame.
---
huh?
---
Yes, engaging games are supposed to be challenging, not just be a clicker fest with sparkles and a cash shop for cosmetics.
---
I had a rogue in my raid who would just ninja locked chests because he was the only one who could open them. I guess we auto skipped the rolling on that one
---
I already forgot this happened and this kid ruined his life over it. Any idea how many years he's getting? What a moron.
---
I go full normie during the week then enter neckbeard mode on the weekends and holidays.
---
That made my hands sweat just watching this. GZ
---
All these post about horde getting groups together to take down high levels are great. The “I ran to the guards and he got pwned” are not so great imo.
---
Most addons are still being worked on and will slowly improve as time goes on. You can type /console scriptErrors 0 and it'll hide the errors but you can't really stop them from happening unless you disable whichever addon is throwing the error.
---
Sonteraven and Bonechewer are 2 excellent blue level polearms for hunters that usually sell for pretty cheap on the ah.
---
He'll probably do a year like the last guy. Precedent proves the US will extradite if he's living abroad.
---
Whats it do
---
Travel (flight paths too) entertainment was taken into account too, i remember hearing a dev say way back they'd add things they thought would look cool even if they served no purpose just so people had things to look at and explore while running/flying. Some of the flight path stuff are zones that are totally pointless too
---
I think I'm on a similar pace. It's just that this will take weeks longer at this pace to hit 60, and I've seen a decent amount of rogues manage much quicker then it feels like it's going to take me. Then again, maybe they're playing 3x as much, while I only play after work and on weekends.
---
Depends on where in Australia... I get 1ms to blizz oceanic servers on 100/40 fibre.
---
Big congrats! As I was taming mine there was a warrior on a ledge above me about 1 feet and I just kept saying “oh please don’t fucking see me oh god oh fuck” thankfully I think he was afk but damn
---
Missed opportunity to put the water at crotch level
---
Yeah. I'd wanna see that on a black mirror episode haha
---
Still using it as a level 28 Rogue here. Have a few gear pieces that have higher stats but not when the bonus is applied.
---
Lmao what a crock of shit fanboy post.
---
"Completely wrong and baseless" seems like a bit much.
---
WoW became what it is today partly because of feedback from the community. People wanted more content, balanced classes, etc, and Blizzard gave it to us. Obviously it wasn't perfect, and in some cases they admitted they messed up and attempted to fix it, not always successfully. That's how games like this have evolved, and you can't seriously tell me that the OSRS devs have NEVER put something into the game that didn't work or that people didn't like. The difference is that Blizzard can't just remove core expansions features from the game once they're implemented, only try to learn from them in the future (which they sometimes manage).
---
But adding more content to classic and creating classic+ would likely (given Blizzard's sub-par track record) would likely just end up with people wanting original classic back again, and now we're back where we started.
---
I mean attacking some indy company would probably be easy but someone like blizzard? Don't they have a good anti ddos system?
---
I know that there was a time in RuneScape when ddos attacks happened quite often (both on individuals and world's) and to my knowledge noone got caught.
---
It started that way but by the time their were 15 horde it became a game. Enjoy the repairs lol.
---
someone actually did the math in a thread a couple weeks back and Hunter with cheetah was faster I believe.
---
Alcor's 500-1000g atm
---
Opinions **based off of their private server practicality** means about as much as fan-generated star wars movies on YouTube should mean to the writers and producers of episode 9. 
---
Blizzards official servers dwarf the popularity of pservers, so the implementation (or lack thereof) of LFR/dungeon finder/flying mounts should be treated as such: with a much higher population potential for each leveling range.
---
Perhaps you worded your first reply to my original post a bit confusingly, but the black and white conclusion you gave was simply inaccurate
---

I'm on the highest pop french server which is always high/full. My guess is that people who don't speak english don't have access to as many guides and stuff and aren't aware of the meta as much, so there's less supply.
---
Always be suspicious if there's a cross-faction priest higher level than you (32+).
---
Sweet as cheers for that, do you know if it was a relatively recent update? I will update tonight regardless.

How long can a message in mail be? Like, how many characters?

Pain is your body telling you stop using those muscles.

 Oh, is there such a thing?

Alliance still does this in retail lmao

Surely the hunter wins easily?
---
The top comment in the thread you're replying to is someone intending to harass the person. It's a reasonable assumption.
---
I mean, it's not like you tried to research it. You're just going for some reddit karma.
---
IIRC each instance of damage has a seperate chance to break fear, with the higher damage having a higher chance to break, as dots and drain spells deal low damage per tick they actually have a relatively low chance of breaking the fear.
---
I could be wrong about that though.

Fun police over here. Sorry everyone no sub-optimal builds. This guy doesnt want you to run a non minmax build while leveling.
---
should put "epics in retail" as first panel.
---
Ever heard of chrome remote desktop?
---
How often are offtanks needed in raiding? And will there be raiding spots for offtank druids in Classic?
---
I believe it was called grid and it was exactly that, a raid frame setup of enemies near you. The problem was it was too useful making things like multi dotting a breeze. So blizz changed the API to break grid and remove that functionality from being possible.
---
I think you can still install grid but it's just a shell now that displays the frames but you can't interact with it at all.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀WE MADE IT BOYS🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
As a warrior, always aim for mobs one or two levels lower.  That, and green quests are your friend.
---
They should, and they will have something better. The 2H staff that drops in ZF is better than this epic 2H. Thrash blade is a much better 1H than either of those swords.
---
Now tell us when it sells for that price lol.

What? Are you actually saying people following you around just to emote is harassment? Hahahahahahahaha How The Fuck Is Waving Cyber Bullying Real Hahahaha Just Walk Away From The Screen Like Close Your Eyes Haha
---
Wish I could gold this comment. Thanks for the laugh.
---
Especially once you get unending breath
---
I'd be so jealous haha I barely got any time to play back in vanilla since my older bro and I shared the computer (ofc he was always on) and I only reached like level 14 (back then I thought I was badass for being 14).
---
Now that I've grown up I may have a job and other responsibilities, however I have so much independence now to do what I want with my free time and if my younger self could witness the late night grinds on this wonderful game, I'm sure he'd be very jealous.
---
You're wrong about EQ. I played from 97-01. People who did bad behavior found themselves quickly shut out of playing.
---
I wish certain emotes got a reaction from guards. Like /spit makes one come over and knock you down.
---
Here is my struggle.. rolled horde at launch with a shaman, got it to 25 then rolled a priest and got it to 36, then switched to alliance for a druid (12) and a pally(12).
---
I have always been an althoolic and just want to sit on a class and play it. 
---
I just want to be able to lvl to 60, be able to farm my gold and pvp. Halp!
---
Demon armor counts towards armor right?  Frost armor as well.
---
No clothie lacks an armor buff.
---
The irony of Quick shots having the same spell icon as Seal of Command is not lost on me, a former paladin.
---
Does Ony reset 5 days after killing her or on a 5 day rotation?
---
Feels like people try to force it a bit too much in barrens chat but I dunno.
---
I bought it from the AH, costed me 10g but whatever.
---
Level 1 lipstick?
---
Also, you don't know what "from scratch" means.
---
Not just in plain sight but yeah, there are probably quite a few cars out there with guns somewhere in them.
---
I want the healer that didn't need on items that fit other classes better than his
---
Yeah, or if you automated a bunch of Uber requests for one city block, causing a traffic jam.
---
Good luck beating Naxx with 5 mages

I don't get why people upload to Imgur instead of Reddit directly.

Have you become addicted to playing the auction house? If so, you are going to absolutely love this game!
---
You forgot the giant knife-ears on the Alliance SpongeBob.
---
Difference was I clicked here and learnt it’s a lot quicker than having my hearth set to Undercity. 
---
More of a helpful hint rather than crying about people who play differently.
---
GTFO negative nancy
---
I’m that warrior, thanks bb.
---
wat
---
sure he can, he just needs to have way more gear than the warrior
---
Thank you sir!
---
Now I need to get the speaker replaced in my goddamn phone.
---
No need for Ranks, because you can only ever cast the highest rank as a warrior. You can tell this for any char/skill by opening your abilities page and seeing if it shows the one ranked skill, or all of them.
---
I usually goes down to around 1g20s when it settles, that's a pretty good price but I bought all mine around 1g 70s
---
The talent section says hover for more info but it doesn't do anything. Am I missing something?
---
I didn’t understand 75% of that but I liked the story!
---
&gt;  it's slowing me down a lot...
---
If you feel this way then it's best to stay away from that zone, perhaps PvP servers in general. 
---
Have gone hours with 0 exp and 0 gold gained and still called it fun/would do again. 
---
Journey before destination?(or however that goes, been a while since i read those books)
---
You’re right. I’m saying that advice is kind of basic and everyone knows savory deviate delights make money later, but right now they’re not doing too hot on the ah lol
---
I actually leveled this way even when it was green. Bought cheap and vendored it with a higher price.
---
I get that IRL before the roller coaster drops or before I have to jump off a cliff/diving board
---
And yes, this affects me intensely in game. It's really weird
---
Unless you’re typing /who 40 rogue and whispering all of them
---
5 agility is better than 10 attack power.
---
I think he might feel like he peaked early, as though maybe WoW raiding was the top end of his life experience. He's young enough to change that but there's some depression afoot here.
---
I see.
---
Now I'm not sure what to do haha.
---
Instead of 4 Engineers, do you think 2 would be more viable and possible to maintain? The thing is... I'm not sure which character to main and focus. So I'm leveling a mage, warlock and priest. I think I'm enjoying Mage and Priest a tad more than Warlock (but I believe Warlocks can be quite fun to PvP with later on... thinking destro lock)
---
The Auction house is the true experience
---
Oh you know, when your faction has 8 lvl 30-35 and the opposing 5-man group has 36-skull. That kinda healthy where you kill their lobbies but everyone else dies. Then it just becomes gorilla warfare, waiting for them to tag mobs before rushing in, killing lobbies, die, rinse and repeat.
---
Google subjective
---
Of course there is no honor, there is DIShonor and that includes:
---
- 1v1 greykills
---
- xv1 on the same level
---
- druids vs druids
---
- stealth vs non-stealth
---
- engaging a pre-whirlwind warrior in combat
---
- MC on boats/zeps
---
- anyone with an escort npc (both as and against)
---
- people fishing
---
- bh
---
Wait, so the fear returns onto the target without you recasting it?
---
There's a global reset every week. 
---
Everyone resets at the same time, it doesn't matter when you killed her or even *if* you killed her.
---
Why are you using this reference for cloth?
---
So i am a level 40 mage with tailoring at 205.What are some good items i cna craft?- or some good recipes i should look out for?/ Where should i farm cloth?
---
Hmmm
---
But why should someone be trusted just because they state they are an expert?
---
&gt; a lvl 29 staff with 15 spi and 6 stam that will sell on the AH for all of 3g.

not exactly the best example of the point you're trying to make

Man, I'm constantly getting feared outside tremor totems range before it can take effect =/
---
Sounds like you joined a fairly elitist/hardcore guild that doesn't have time or patience to help new players, that or they're assholes that did you a favour!
---
Either way you're better off finding a new home that fits your experience. There will many new player friendly guilds who will still get raid kills and give you an opportunity to gain loot. You just have to be honest and ask questions to ensure its the right fit for them and for you.
---
Don't be discouraged, you may be one conversation away from finding and playing with a really great bunch of people that you create memories you'll cherish forever. Finding the right bunch of people in this game is everything. Good luck!
---
I mean you are literally making things up to seem like ret pally is better than holy in a situation.
---
Stop justifying it. They suck. The game balance is awful. It just is how it is.
---
Take this out of the context of the game, and think about walking down the street. Yeah, I'm saying if I was known for taking offence to being waved at for a reason you don't know. You actively making an effort to wave at me and have me acknowledge it is harassment.
---
Wow.
---
You broke ToS. Deal with it
---
Most ppl are surprised I also play video game with a passion (mmorpg gamer). I stop caring what ppl optton how I spent my time or money a long time ago lol
---
I stood there and yelled “Can someone spark this for me?”  But no one came to help :(
---
ya, theres zero reason to not just run away if someones baiting you to fight a silver/gold for them
---
"What are you in here for?"
---
"Oh you know, the usual, slingin crack, drive-bys; you?"
---
"I uh, stopped some nerds from playing a game for a few hours"
---
Was speaking of spellcleave, not melee.
---
I identify with the new microgeneration of xenials at age 37. Grew up without tech but adept at using it.
---
If that's what they're saying, then definitely wrong.
---
Yes
---
I've killed a ridiculous amount of alliance in front of the brd entrance. They just hop out wanting to reset yet there I am, flinging spells at faces while cackling like a maniac.
---
I'm so glad classic exists.
---
Any idea how long the corpse stuck around? Did it disappear quickly like other corpses in classic do? Thanks
---
Thrall's balls!
---
Imagine getting your dumb ass arrested because you DDoS'd a game from 2005 lol
---
*Officer, I'd like report these 4 men for waving at me.*
---
alliance players are better at the game, but I agree, fuck the alliance
---
&gt; has the potential of increasing realm population sizes to much higher than pservers
---
Once again, you haven't read the 80-page post-mortem written by the developers of the most infamous p-server, which I can't name here because of the subreddit rules.
---
By the way, these are the same developers who had a famous development meeting with Blizzard to share many of their techniques and insights. Insights which led to the release of Classic WoW today.
---
Seems like you're completely unaware of any of this.
---
These same developers released an 80-page post mortem going into all the myriad ways in which the whole game breaks if you don't keep the numbers within a certain range.
---
Remember that dynamic spawns didn't really exist in Vanilla—at least not the way they do in retail—so all sorts of mechanics broke down instantly. A server's economy could routinely be destroyed by tweaking a single spawn rate.
---
That's just one of the many issues with “just raise the population cap!” A terrible armchair-design if I've ever seen one.
---
One way trip to pound town. Hope it was worth it.
---
I think it’s called karma.
---
Yeah I actively play it. But there is one thing that breaks it for me, and that's the loading screens at every map border. Unacceptable.
---
Pretty sure he was referring to the bags.
---
Kali is just Linux with some common tools installed or within their repo. You could write your own metasploiy module if you find a vulnerability but obviously you have to understand the concepts first. Most the code I write in gigs is custom but honestly stole credentials are the most common way (less noisy too) to move around these days
---
Brokentooth
---
Yeah, sounds about right lol
---
I have 20%  as a rogue atm i don't see the problem
---
So I want to make a character that's very strong at PvP, specifically 1v1s. Is Warlock as good at 1v1s as people say in general or do you have to specifically spec Soul Link to be good at that? I've heard from more experienced players that Soul Link is a bit of a noob trap spec so I'm wondering if Warlock's PvP still shines with the other builds. 
---
Also what does Lock vs warrior and lock vs hunter look like in a 1v1, open world setting?
---
I won't read this horde bullshit, here, take this downvote
---
Someone find a pic
---
Yeah but a class who uses the weapon for 45% of their damage shouldn't need it over a class who uses it for 100%
---
I'll have the clams casino
---
What the fuck even is this
---
This is gunna sound dumb but it’s kinda a school shooter mentality ...
---
Until you find something better.
---
I mean, Everquest had it, but it was developed in the mid 90's. But FFIXV was developed after 2010 (the second version, that is). WoW was developed at the turn of the century and don't have it. The first version of FFIXV didn't have it. So there is just no excuse whatsoever.
---
And you are right, it really breaks immesion.
---
he got unbanned dumbo
---
Is there a start to finish guide to set up WoW on phone ?
---
Druids offer innervate and cress, but their hots don't stack, so you'll have a lot of wastage.
---
I gave the account 1 gold, so ive actually made just shy from 33 gold. The game time on the character is 1 day 14 hours. Would be great to post Auction House history but I don't seem to have an option for it
---
In the yeti cave today as a warlock, sharing mobs with two alliance players.  Eventually they started tagging mobs that I had already dotted, so I immediately attacked and killed them both.  They came back once more and I managed to kill them both again, after that I had the cave all to myself.
---
Does anybody know some good horde guilds on Noggenfogger? I can play a lot but I want the feeling to be more towards the casual and relaxed side of playing.
---
Love it. Very clear all you said. I just applied and it went better than before.

Low level dungeon non caster mobs

I did last batch of transfers from Rattlegore to Anathema. 
---
It's pretty dead during off-peak times right now, but you still see some people around. In the prime-time it's full enough for anything, lots of groups to find. I kind of like being able to quest and have mobs still alive to kill :D
---
Well, making your own zombie farm is hard-mode.
---
Infecting/building/emulating thousands of computers to put out a DDOS is quite a feat.
---
Are you serious? That makes no sense at all. Not to mention there are layers.
---
I play shaman and mage. To me it's really fun. Once you hit 40, elemental shamans really start wrecking shop.
---
What a feeling
---
Im 41 with 60g and no mount
---
Well, blizz couldve made it somewhat better, like offering free transfer only for one faction. If 30% of horde from stonespine would leave for another server, then stonespine would be more or less balanced.
---
In my state it's not considered concealed carry in the glove box so you don't need to get the concealed carry license.
---
Taking down Blizzard and Wikipedia? He's going to have millions in fines and probably 10-15 years in prison. His life is over.
---
My friend only makes portals in kargath and makes 135-200g a day. He hit 60 on his Shaman yesterday, which is his main, and got his mount instantly.
---
Whats the UI and nameplate addon?
---
You are mistaken, pvp deaths do not give you durability loss.
---
That's how it goes in STVietnam sometimes.
---
Oh man, as a Warrior I usually end up losing fights against Mages...especially when they get the jump on me. However, today, I began carrying Free Action potions. Saw a mage dismount, target me, and began casting Frostbolt. I smirked, popped my free action potion and charged at him and layed my Hamstring on him. He attempts to Frost Nova (failed) and blinked away. I intercepted him and began wailing on him, interrupting his sheep, and killed the poor sap before he even had a chance. He /nodded me as if he new I put my try hard hat on. Never felt so good to kill a mage. I was 57 and he was 60.
---
I wasn’t even mad when it was happening.  Just did other stuff and came back with no issue.  Double win for me!
---
(My condolences to those who got royally dicked over by the whole ordeal.)
---
You will be 41 b4 u get your mount maybe 42
---
lol.
---
I'm not cherry picking anything. I'm responding to you posting wrong facts, not even opinions. Just straight up wrong facts.
---
Because mobs don't take half an hour to die when you\`re shadow. And by the time you\`ve finished off one mob - the previous one hasn't respawned yet.
---
Obligatory: For the love of god, screenshot!

Enchantrix, part of Auctioneer suite, does this.
---
Yeah, glad I'm not working there anymore.
---
Its also really cool on a pvp server because it sometimes lets you sneak past ganking groups of the enemy faction.
---
Do we have any specific information on the attack?
---
I know, ma fren. I was just using the double meaning of "walk" in that sentence and I used the literal meaning as in the capability to walk. 
---
PS: Thanks for telling me, I feel better now!
---
Sure, but you're a *good* priest. How many of those do you know?
---
Depends on the scale of the attack. This guy took down Blizzard's servers and also Wikipedia's, so I'd say a few million in fines and 10-10 years in jail.
---
He gon get them cheeks clapped
---
Awesome! Go out and be an awesome tank! Its a ton of fun.
---
It's always a Gnome.

The logic mean no one really needs to get upset.
---
Clothie daddie just doesn't have the same ring to it.
---
So they're basically the same??? /s
---
This is a theory. Players know druids are healbots at endgame, so fewer players are rolling kittens or owls.
---
I would have rolled a Feral druid if they weren't so bad at murder in world pvp, healbots at 60 and not reliant on a supply of crowd pummelers
---
I guess you could say, what about shamen/paladin. Druids cannot heal in catform and that's sad.
---
Yeah

This is the type of case where the kid gets made an example of. Running a botnet and taking down services temporarily used to be a funny 4chan prank, but in the last decade it's been seen more and more as a serious cyber crime when the number of victims is this massive. 
---
Blizzard recently worked with the Korean government to send a man to prison for making/distributing Overwatch hacks. In this case they've already provided enough evidence to make an arrest, and they can prove injury (in the legal sense) to hundreds of thousands of people who lost access to a paid service as a result of his actions. IANAL but it seems like an open-and-shut case and I'm curious to see hoe it shakes out. Blizzard certainly has the money to pursue it as hard as they want to. 
---
I doubt they'll keep us updated because it's in the courts now but hopefully we can learn more when he's sentenced.
---
Agreed. One should be Booty Bay.
---
lmao sounds like a cult guild, weird people
---
Druids still have their higher threat going for them, as well as a couple unique strengths.
---
Not a lot of info, there.
---
The main issue with that fiasco was Blizz’s lack of communication to customers. They should have been upfront about the attacks in the first place.
---
Additionally, they should make the ID known.
---
"Hand of justice drops"
---
Yeah, no it doesn't
---
kek
---
Lmao..they kicked you because you didn’t do a corpse run one time? What the actual fuck. Don’t play with people like that man it will absolutely jade you and fuck your whole experience up. Yes if the raid wipes it’s standard practice for everyone to run back but it’s not a fuckin sin.
---
True

No offense if you consult but how hard is it for the programmers to export to CSV? Direct port to DB....

Ill share my story of the day very breefly.
---
Doing brd and a leather chest drop, the healer priest need on it but he lose the roll and the drood wins it.
---
"Hey Priest, that was a leather piece" i said
---
"Oh Sorry" he respond
---
We go ahead and some shoulder with frost dmg on it drops, the healer priest need on them too but lose the roll and the frost mage wins it.
---
"Hey Priest, that was just frost dmg" i said
---
"Oh sorry" he responded
---
We keep going and one boss drop some nice lega with +40 heals, the LOCK need on them and win.
---
"Hey lock, that was a healer piece" said the Priest.
---
"Oh Sorry" responded the lock.
---
Morale of the story, everyone is retarded
---
I have way more gold than I ever had any other time leveling on private servers. And I realized the reason is I have the vendor price addon. It shows on the tooltip what items sell to the vendor for.
---
So when accepting quest rewards I am always choosing the most valuable item, when deleting stuff from my bags because they are full and I cant pick something up, I'm always deleteing the least valuable. 
---
This has all added up big time at 52
---
And probably won't be allowed to be near a computer again.
---
I saw a 4 pack of ddos on the counter at the gas station last time I was in there

It's not a TOS violation to have multiple wow account under the same Bnet.

Okay, this is absolute gold. That gnome will **never** live that down. Never

If you have trouble comprehending written text, then perhaps reddit isn't a place for you. Census data is even more unreliable thanks to layers, thanks for reminding me, I forgot about that.
---
Except why would the average player want to go to a server where their faction is *less* populated.
---
Not even open world PVP? I am certain because the 2nd time I got killed by the warrior, I was red.

Don’t take dal rends or hoj. That was a joke

Ya, I’ve noticed that out of all the instances I’ve ran so far in classic, I’ve only been in one group with a hunter (and that’s not because I was the group leader and was like, eff hunters, I haven’t seen them in LFG chat and when I do it’s rare).
---
&gt;The hunter has won not only Hand of Justice, but Ironfoe? Can he even use maces? You begin to type, but you cannot form words. Your fingers are useless, the only thing that enters the text box is your emotional distress and fatigue transformed into text.
---
Holy fuck my sides
---
I remember when those jerks shut down the EVE servers. Glad they got caught
---
Then you need to reserve the loot beforehand - but that's probably going to limit your options a fair bit. Everyone is there to get upgrades, they're aren't there to clear the dungeon to gear you up.
---
Personally, if I saw a hunter that needed a ranged weapon and I were playing a class where the ranged weaponry was secondary, I'd pass for them. But I hold no ill will towards people that don't - you go through most dungeons getting no loot at all, if there's any piece of gear that does end up being an upgrade it's not unfair to want to grab it.
---
 what's the point in having an alt account and if i make an alt should it be on the same server as my first character?
---
I've never played any wow until now with wow classic
---
Use it like a health potion basically. If you are taking serious burst and think you might die, pop it.
---
If it procs on Scatter Shot, it will break the CC.
---
I feel good about this and it’s not even my character.
---
Your comparing confirmation bias with stats. Idiot.
---
Doubt anyone's got close to good enough gear for it
---
Basically,  just ride along the mountains.
---
Thanks dood
---
IDK on Bigglesworth lately the STV chat has been pretty bad...
---
Um... yeah, I was...
---
If we get classic plus I want these quests for all classes, just like they originally promised.
---
I'd bet it's a rich kid who won't sit a night in jail.
---
Baseline NPC damage should be increased, not just elite damage.
---
I'm on that server.   Had issues through Sunday night.
---
Its unlikely 1v1 but as a warlock I've gotten the best of skulls once or twice.   They start getting cocky and toying with me, until I pop all my CDs and start chain fearing them.
---
Some people are saying it was his own farm, which is much more impressive than when everyone assumed he rented it as most DDoS attackers do.
---
I was engineer on mage in burning crusade. It was super fun but that's basically it. Is it good on mage? We already have so many ranged spells so I don't see why in classic besides taking Gnomish and having fun with mind control and jumper cables to rez the priest (which was always awesome when it worked).
---
Why does Heartseeker currently have a Character Transfer *off* the realm available? As I understand, this started being offered earlier today. It's not a High/full realm.
---
Actually the new server is hosted in Brazil. I transfered a character and the ping is indeed low.
---
Most likely than not every consumer-level device has a backdoor installed at the production level, I don't think a VPN could protect you from the FBI
---
Was this post really worth sharing this guy’s name over to the whole subreddit?
---
Cuz pvp makes no sense if there is no one to kill? Maybe some geniuses think that realm where they're faction dominates is fun, but then bgs will roll in and one faction will have a very hard time earning those marks.

People seem to forget about this and wonder why the current game is so easy.
---
Arathi is great for druids, almost as warsong. Catform lets you stealth on point and bait with ur gf while you pocket heal in the bush, you can ninja points in stealth, you can even run away in combat with travel form.
---
Funny thing is, before the numbers came out I was saying that it was HEAVILY horde sided, and even said at least 60/40. Was told I was wrong, complaining, don't play on a pvp server, etc. I'm not complaining, but I brought it up because it's definitely an issue. A pretty big issue that a lot of Horde players don't think affects them, but it does.
---
Yikes, sorry friend. Just remember how few of those faulkers there are out there. Put em on ignore and say so, it encourages others to silence tbe toxic voices
---
Playing a Warrior properly for the first time ever.. he ain’t wrong chief! 
---
Always been a tank at heart but mained Pally in BC / LK and Pala / DK into Cata / MoP / WoD etc. a Warrior in Classic just feels so right! Have even been having a blast tanking, lvl 35 - no threat meters or aggro problems yet.
---
Yeah I will edit, I probably could of managed it as you can buy  some items for less than 10 copper
---
Considering the vast disparity in played quantity between the two, and the existence of some healing druids it is impressive
---
Came here to say this
---
I got the ''Cassandra's Grace'' item from a Frayfeather Hippogryph, it seems amazing so i googled and turns out it's pre-bis gear for Holy Priests, should i sell it now or later? and for how much?
---
I kill all alliances i see. Today i walked from arathi to badlands and killed probably 50 alliance
---
This actually made me spit my beer out.
---
Like not follow the path that led to what we have now in retail.
---
Free transfers have historically never solved the faction imbalance issue, especially with regards to PvP.
---
By far the largest influence on PvP imbalance was racials and classes.
---
I am tailor/enchanter.
---
Yeah this
---
After reading earlier posts I realized i was making the mistake of self-victimization instead of taking it as an opportunity to acquire new friends and allies in a fun pvp encounters
---
Agreed I spent one hour fighting off assholes and getting zero drops. It’s better to just farm the gold and get it over with.
---

Some people just want to watch the world burn...
---
Also, some folks are just dumb and think they will get away with it.
---
You assume too much. It makes you seem childish. I was a pserver guy myself, and am familiar with all of the events leading to their shutdown. I was mocking your interpretation of their significance, as well as your reliance on a heavily processed post from one of the developers.
---
Blizzard dwarfs pservers. Prove me wrong. If you can't, you're unequipped to rebut the theory that Blizzard is more capable of maintaining an assumed success of official servers.
---
What you are describing is called "Drain tanking" and its one of the most efficient leveling methods and specs in the game. Soul shard farming is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be but if you are only doing 5 mans, you can get away with just maintaining 5-6 soul stones (2 to summon players, 1 to SS healer, and 1 to make a lock rock for the tank). Priests are op for pvp - but past that they are not the greatest for leveling speed.
---
Listen, at the end of the day you should do what interests you, this game is so dense you’ll only really know what you want after a LOT of trial and error. This particular path will leave you struggling, but hell you may like it anyway. I encourage you to follow your gut and try everything. 
---
The one caveat is that you should pace yourself. Try one thing at a time and don’t get too caught up in planning ahead. Maybe just try engineering on one character just to see what you make of it, and if you like it then go nuts.
---
thrash blade you get at 47 which is pretty awesome
---
Alts are used for many things. Many people have bank alts that they send all their items to which they want to sell on the AH (so their mains don't have to visit cities often). It's also useful as bank space and bag space are hard to come by in classic. 
---
Also people play want to play more than one class. Or want to level up more than one character to 60 down the line. 
---
Yes, your alts should be on the same server so you can help them out with gear and gold down the line if they need it.
---
This type of tit for tat between alliance and horde is not the nutshell you’re looking at. 
---
This is vengeance being taken out of an unknowing player who had nothing to do with the initial encounter nutshell. 
---
Same shit will happen when this fella can’t find you in game and just face rolls a lowbie.
---
The faction someone rolls does not determine their personality and those who think it does...well...it speaks volumes about them.
---
I disagree, I'd say that there IS honour in WPVP, and it's only able to exist because you can be dishonourable.
---
The fact that I could kill an enemy 10 levels lower than me but choose not to can only be honourable if I even have that choice in the first place, which is what makes choosing to be peaceful on a pvp server so meaningful.
---
That said, I'm totally fine with people ganking each other and choosing to be dishonourable, hell the game wouldn't be so fun and tense if I wasn't constantly wondering whether the nearby enemies will turn on me or ignore me while i'm questing.
---
Can you give me an example?

How does layer hopping instances work and what's the benefit?

4 of you have 1 person invite you to their group (in a separate instance) and you transfer to a full instance but at the boss location? Or you start at the start but don't have to reset the instance?

warriors ar egreat, you can tank as arms, no problem, doing heaps of dungeons as tank ensures you will always have good gear too, which is needed as a warrior. Warriors are a fine alt, dont listen to all the doom and gloom

You do realize all melee dps suffer heavily on baron because of the extreme amounts of downtime with his AOE?
---
You can have a different character on the same server that can be used as an extra bank.
---
You can level them too to have different professions that can benefit your main.
---
Plus, you may end up preferring your alt and making them your main.
---
Two days ago we camped nesingwary in STV with 5 people for 20 min. We wanted to piss of alliance players so much that they form groups and gank us. It worked. After 20 min killing anyone that tried to give in quests at nesingwary a full on war broke out and at least 30 people on both sides tried to control it.
---
Bought 2 mark of Kern rings, now I cant get the other out of my mailbox without destroying the one I have equipped. I would like to put the other on the ah but I cant take it out of the mail box even if the other is in the bank. Am I screwed?
---
Cleave groups are cancer. Stay far away. The only bad dungeon experiences I've had in Classic have both been cockhead mages mad that we are CCing and pulling too slowly and leaving the group.
---
I'm always excited to talk to people about games and gaming (even if they aren't excited to hear it, haha). When I was younger I used to consider myself inferior to others because I played mmo's/games in general. Now that I'm older I don't really care about what people might think about how I chose to spend my free time. I do what I love and genuinely believe that gaming is a far better hobby than most 'normal' hobbies.
---
What?
---
I dont think you can compare private servers to what blizz is doing now for a few reasons. 
---
Most private servers have a pay-to-win mechanics that allow you to purchase levels or items or gold. Of course the economy is bloated! I can buy 1000g for 14.99, so the price of everything goes up when everyone is rolling in dough, especially because not all pseervers require a subscription base too. 
---
Also being able to buy levels or gear means you can skip certain dungeons or entire areas all together.
---
I think the reason why it sucks when you're all "naxxed out" is because not everyone who has it worked for it like people actually did in vanilla days. 
---
Not bashing all pservers but the 3 or 4 I played on all had a pay to win feature, which more or less made people not give a shit about the gear. The only one I played on that wasnt pay to win, the XP and drop rate for items was so rediculous that nothing mattered.
---
Sure, but nothing I've read puts it much lower than 200ms. Nothing indicates people have say, 50ms reaction speed.
---
Again - you don't know what "from scratch" means.
---
LOL classic “I was just pretending not to know!” Sit down lil' boy.
---
Yeah there's probably a lot more variation in the 20-50 range when everyone is just wearing all higgledy piggeldy mismatched armour sets compared to end game where everyone is just working towards the Best In Slot.
---
Unfortunately I dare say the BiS crowd are the ones more likely to bother paying for a commission of their MMO character so you'd probably get away with it.
---
Personally they did ok through TBC and started to drift about halfway through Wrath. Cata to me completely destroyed WoW.

I have this currently on my Hunter, no one in the group wanted it when it dropped so I took it for lols. To my surprise, it procs surprisingly often and is great for when you fall in wingclip range and you get a bonus 3 sec stun on target to then get extra range from them. In a min max world it's not great, but I am convinced this is the greatest Hunter weapon for level grinding.
---
I would never roll need on this over a warrior/shaman though.
---
What is a good threat meter? I remember having a good and simple one back in the day, but don't remember the name of it.
---
You're right, your comment was way more informative and helpful. Go fuck yourself.
---
Sweet, warlock it is then. I assume I need to do horde lock so that I dont go up against the undead passive
---
&gt; camera pans to Ocon expressionlessly watching TV
---
Thats the joke.
---
Look at the satyrs...no horns!
---
On the thumbnail i only saw the pie chart for tanks so i thougt the entire raid was 90% warriors and 10% druids
---
Low 30s is shimmering flat. High 30s is desolace in the NE killing basilisk and shit. Skinning required.
---
As an australian with FTTP, we are the lucky ones dude. Majority of Australia is pretty much some of the worst in the first world (and much of the third world too...)
---
Pretty sure I've read alot of the nuclear stuff is still done with floppy disks and such because the computers are so old they arent connected to any network and cant really be hacked from the outside
---
TIL...this changes a lot for me
---
Oh well in that case it was totally worth ruining his life.
---
Are layers similar to channels in MapleStory?
---
That may very well be the case, but it's not my problem to solve, I'm looking for a realm that I will enjoy being a part of. Whether my departure will change anything or not, it's not something that I care about. I'm paying money to have fun, so either I will switch to a realm where I have fun, or I'll stop paying.
---
I love these kinds of stories.
---
You should get those cushion pads.amazon sells them for like 5 to 10 bucks each
---
Does whoever tagged it get the sphere drop that way?
---
youve really given us nothing to work with, can you explain what sort of game play you like so we can help you pick? also also the game just isnt about raiding remember that
---
Worst talent, but I’ve always struggled to speak to them too. Seems it’s a very popular choice with Russians who never seemed to want to talk to us in the group
---
&gt; Most private servers have a pay-to-win mechanics that allow you to purchase levels or items or gold.
---
I wasn't talking about any of those. Only talking about the non-P2W p-servers. It seems you successfully avoided the only Blizz-like ones.
---
Unfortunately even on the Blizz-like ones, after everyone is Naxxed out and max level, the game starts to break down. Understandably.
---
Yes because everyone else in the group is doing it and you aren't going to solo the 5man while you wait lll
---
I think that's the joke.
---
all it takes is the loic, access to a botnet, and voila you can ddos
---
wish script kiddies would get good or fucking kill themselves
---
On a few occasions since launch, I've gone to bed instead of pursuing certain leveling milestones. Shit, last week on Sunday I practically went to bed *early* instead of hitting 46 or whatever it was. I cried myself to sleep. When did I become such a filthy casual?
---
There are three main reasons people make alts:
---
#1: for fun. Trying out a different class or a different race's starting zones, maybe seeing if it's more fun than they're main class.
---
#2: for convenience. Sometimes your raid group just needs a particular class or role, and you may choose to bite the bullet (or, in a more hardcore guild, be required to) and level up an alt of the desired class.
---
#3: a bank alt, a low-level character that sits in capital cities and acts as an auction broker and storage space for your main. While playing on your main, you can mail any greens or items you plan on selling on the AH to your bank alt to save your main's bag space and require fewer trips into cities. Often, people will level their bank alt up to 5 so they can learn enchanting and be able to disenchant items for extra value.
---
In the case of #2 and #3,the alt has to be on the same server. For #1, it didn't necessarily have to be, and in fact *can't* be if you're playing on a PVP server and want to try out the other faction, because on a PVP server you can only have characters on one faction or the other, not both.
---
You can, and many people are. But the market will be fucking absolutely flooded when BGs drop and twinking starts. These items are rare in the sense that they usually have a 1% drop rate or whatever, but with so many people levelling up there are just so many coming into the game. 
---
In TBC I paid 1k gold for assassins blade, and 200g for feet of the lynx. I can't see prices getting anywhere near that in Vanilla.
---
Legitimately. Emotions are weird.
---
Underrated comment of the day
---
I’m lucky to have a bunch of RL friends playing this time around.. at lvl 30 on the dot I was in STV farming tusks with my charms in pocket. 
---
Pretty sure my lvl 54 friend swung by for the elite. That Whirlwind Axe was a beaut, I don’t think I paid attention to the quest at all sadly :(
---
Go get that axe!
---
Except everything you hated in Cata had [its seeds sown in TBC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6ludu/the_success_of_classic_should_be_an_eyeopener_to/f0u8am5/)
---
Got feared into a dungeon, the fear didn't expire after zoning in, and ran me into a pack of mobs who then killed me 100-0 without the fear breaking.
---
That's almost as good as being stuck for a whole minute just because a rogue decided to sap you.
---
And yet happy to comment on it to fit your narrative
---
I had a few co-workers who played a fuuuck ton of bideogaems with me and we still do, but I've known them for years now. Since moving to a new city, I haven't made any friends, especially gamers.
---
But don't let it be your name, just tell people you enjoy videos and MMOs. You'd be surprised who plays videogames, I hear "didn't take you for a gamer" all the time
---
Reminds me of darkest dungeon occultist heals... At least this potion can't crit for 0 then bleed you!
---
Yeah I agree, I like the Tauren totem aesthetic but at the same time classic feels like the perfect time period for an orc shaman given Thrall’s horde coming off of the heels of WC3.
---
Tauren hunter also feels nice since the starting zone heavily emphasizes the Great Hunt which gets a little lost on retail
---
Yes! Recklessness just makes them immune to the fear but it's not purged so if you remove reckless with a different curse they go back to being feared
---
Because they often don't understand how their actions affect (effect?) so many other people.
---
LOL, I like this. Thanks for the laugh.
---
Locks are awesome 1v1 regardless of spec. Soul Link is even better.
---
You have great CC with Fear and Succubus Seduce. Your Felpuppy can solo casters. You are very tanky with Siphon Life/ Drain and VW Sacrifice if you're into that. Healthstones are life pots that people can't whine at you for using.
---
Warriors shouldn't be an issue as you can out sustain and kite them. Hunters may be a little trickier, but they don't have much to counter you directly.
---
Hurts uber drivers though who tend to be on the poorer side of society, so that kinda sucks
---
Fucking white people and their.....  
---
/roll
---
2s clam stacks
---
Don’t worry, you would only make kairozdormu proud by making yet another timeline
---
I was gonna fish until I saw they were pretty much vendor price on the AH.
---
Growing up playing wow definitely helped my social anxiety.
---
I went from a kid who only read guild chat in game and sitting alone and never participated in school, to becoming an officer discussing the guilds logs in detail for 3 hours after raid and captain of the rugby team...
---
This game taught me a lot in how to approach and treat people. Nothing can prepare you better for dealing with anxiety in real life, like telling a real life friend that hes off the raid team due to performance...
---
Bro that's like nearly half of the time since launch.
---
The fuck is AYSO?
---
Dk64 reference makes me feel old
---
Np, make that money
---
Hopefully it can be pieced back, good luck!
---
I don't know if it's relevant, but I always put the /startattack *first*, and have the /cast second.
---
I regret my transfer to Anathema from Bigglesworth.  LookingForGroup has some people, but nothing like it was on Bigglesworth.  You can get some questing done in peace, but I don't think it will last long term.  
---
Probably going to re-roll on another server at this point.
---
Deadjoke not avaiable sadly. But yeah after reconsideration i decided against a pun name
---
Don't think I said that, I'm still maining the warrior.
---
What's the issue? Don't get it sorry
---
I'd watch that anime in a heartbeat
---
Type “/join lookingforgroup” that the default world chat channel for anyone looking for a group. You could also try trade chat when you are in a city. Or join a guild also.
---
Curious, why do you think this is such a 'Mission Critical' bug?  
---
What impact has it had on your enjoyment of the product?  
---
If you had not known about this bug at all, would your enjoyment still have been impacted?
---
If developers were fired for unintended bugs, there would be no developers left to hire in the world.
---
For real. Shamys and Locks are the two classes I just can’t figure out 1v1 as a rogue. Always had trouble with em.
---
Some people just wake up angry.
---
Glad you're unbanned! Would be interested in the reason why you were banned, but they may not give one if it's part of a wave so as to not reveal what they do/don't know
---
To be fair it was like 2 afternoons total.
---
Careful, posting people's names is against the rules, counts as "witch-hunting" good way to get the thread deleted and a ban.
---
bonk
---
Well it works atleast.
---
Just drag the item onto your bar. Making a macro is a useless step.
---
Thanks! and lmao its honestly so stressful sitting there completely helpless
---
I'm a lvl 19 rogue atm, only like 3g and 10ish s. Should I be looking at daggers on AH or should I wait for a drop/quest reward?
---
Bonk reminds me of my friend Chukka.
---
I use classic threat meter
---
all i can read is you saying. 'im a retard'
---
Nice, bro. Did you connect the keyboard and mouse to your phone? How did you make that work, if you don't mind explaining?
---
Agreed.
---
This is a Bigglesworth Bonk please teach bonk how this game works it’s very hard
---
Thanks, palms were sweating the whole time lol
---
[Here](https://blog.pcrisk.com/windows/12765-page-fault-in-nonpaged-area#introduction) you go.
---
Aight, you go ahead and drag some cloth to your bar and tell me how it went.
---
Shit priest if he didn't bring water.
---
I hope they don't. It took away from the appeal of having a unique pet.
---
We slaughter a lot of animals and people in almost every quest.
---
Are you living in 1820 or 2020? lol
---
Spoken like an Alliance dog!
---
It works exactly as this does - shows the total number in my bag (even when multiple stacks).
---
Thanks but I meant in a pvp context
---
ngl I had to wipe my mouse down after this encounter lmao
---
rolling Troll, awesome
---
Yeah but it also wasn't all servers and regions. Annoying sure if you got hit but what a stupid think to ruin your life over.
---
Fear does seem to be bugged in pvp.  It breaks in pve on damage as expected, but I’ve both been feared and seen other people feared for 10+ seconds while the lock spams his entire spellbook.
---
Sounds like you should play gw2 I'll do when the classic adventure ends again and return to characters not aged by vertical progression.  They did not for the past 6 years.
---
I'm not sure what you mean here.
---
If you're asking people who are playing Classic what their opinion is, then you're asking people who've been playing exactly as long as you have.
---
If we're tourists, then you are too. If you're not a tourist, then neither are we.
---
Why are you insulting people?
---
I was so proud when I got it. Hurted to stick it in the bank. Can't wait to have it again!
---
Corporations don't usually make matter of fact statements about such things
---
Humans will always feel the need to prove to the world that they exist.  In other words, 'notice me senpai' but pathological.
---
Host a totally anonymous C&amp;C server that you paid for with zcash in a country which won’t honor US search warrants. Private VPN into that server (never from a home IP) as an extra layer then proxy chain the requests from the slaves to the C&amp;C server. You won’t get caught for a long time if you’re not an idiot.
---
Is there a limit on how much rested xp you get? Can I have rested xp until 60 if I don’t play for a while?
---
If you havnt tried out twitch, you should. Its a fun way to interact with the gaming community
---
After darkshore, you can progress straight into Ashenvale (Pretty! Night elf rep! Lots of horde!) Or alternately you can take the boat from Auberdine to Wetlands.  Wetlands is level-appropriate for you too.
---
It becomes a "lets watch James Spader monologue" show. Which is entertaining I'll give you that, but the actual premise gets real flimsy real fast.
---
Thanks for posting, was wondering how to do this
---
So compare them to only Melee DPS then, they are still low
---
Well thats odd, it doesnt work for me, must be an addon?
---
When the servers are down, but your Adderall is kicking in
---

---
check me out man
---
Feel like this also says something about the general population of wow players in classic.. cause MAN are there a lot of Warriors, Mages and Priests!
---
Im sure you can get some from dungeons at your level. Don’t spend any money on gear.
---
You can have friends buff you, they just can't help with the quest.
---
When I did it back in vanilla I had a mage for int, druid for motw, and another priest for spirit buff and to res me after fails.
---
this only works with items that you are able to make into something. like you need 10 of something to make x.   this macro works for everything. Ive wanted this for a long time OP. Thanks a lot for making this thread
---
The auction house is its own game, but it's a slippery slope. One minute you're sniping cheap enchanting mats and the next you're crashing a market because someone had the gall to keep undercutting you while you were talking to some Russian guy on Skype to sell some of your gold to make room for more.
---
You were lucky on the eye drops! I have seen guilds farming for days. Back in vanilla.
---
If you were alliance, and they were horde.... you’d have been dead.
---
Ok, would be very awkward if it just tells you.
---
I don't think so - all I use is Details!, Questie, and VendorPrice.
---
Might be a setting I've changed, but not sure.
---
A good loot council beats DKP every day. Here is why. 
---
To progress as a guild it is important to prioritize a few things that DKP avoids doing. 
---
1. Tank Priority on gear
---
2. Healer Priority on gear
---
3. Items that are not just an upgrade for you, but also a BIS for your class/spec
---
4. Getting Tier sets to those classes that most benefit the raid
---
It sucks, especially when you are not the one chosen to get the set pieces first or coveted items first. At the end of the day though the council's goal is not to be fair, but to progress the guild as much as possible. Not prioritizing loot drops to classes that benefit the most from them can end in some bosses stopping progression where it could have been avoided by simply giving the loot to the best option.
---
Tried explaining this to my friends and they all called me “greedy” for wanting more gold then I needed haha. Idk what there complaining about I paid for those subs with WoW Gold..
---
Tbh it was kinda fun. It was comical trying to keep an SM group together through all the server restarts, made for a fun time. Boy, he sure showed us.
---
punishirt im so stoked about this. thx a lot
---
Lol he meant people who have never played classic wow before,I'm pretty sure u understood it well...
---
Best tank, best DPS, and most well-rounded healer, makes sense frankly
---
Except if you make the gear worse than Naxx but have it come out after Naxx then people will only do it for the novelty.
---
Agreed, I'd try a feral tank if you wanted to try something different that can still tank.
---
Can confirm the only formular i havent seen that are World drop is 4 stat chest. Got every other recipe learned on my main.
---
To properly 2H tank a cleave group you need to be adequately geared and have a group composition of equally skilled and geared players to blow up the mobs before it becomes an issue. Most pugs don't meet this criteria and expect the healer to carry them. Just don't group with these idiots and let them die and fail.  I did all of my ZF farming with a proper swears and board tank and we levels faster than cleave groups because we didn't need to stop and wait for healer mana constantly and we could afford a few mistakes.
---
Tourist are people that didn’t play Vanilla(+TBC/Wrath) in 2006, but they had an active retail subscription prior to the Classic launch. Thus, they are “touring” a version of the game they never played.
---
I only ever kill people (even lowlevels) once the boat leaves, after the loading screen when they're alive again I let them be. I'm a merciful god.
---
The fastest of the fastest of senjin sprinters!
---
Your primary goal before level 40 is to save gold for your mount.
---
I try not to spend a single silver on gear before then. You will replace it too fast for it to be worth the money spent.
---
If you have particularly bad luck and are still using a level 19 dagger at level 29 or something, then spending a little money on an upgrade won't break you, but you should look at quest rewards and dungeon drops on Wowhead or something to see if there is a better and cheaper option around the corner.
---
IMO, if PvP is your goal, you should go engi, period.
---
It's the only profession that gives you additional CC options, and it gives you multiple. For that reason alone I think it's a must-choose.
---
Okay, I can do dungeons at my level? I feel so weak lol
---
Well I’m not 60 yet, so that.
---
I have a habit of /farting on people as I fly past them.
---
Why did I read this as anal beads? &gt;_&lt;
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀HIDE POLL RESULTS🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Tell me about it. I’ve mained a rogue since TBC, and started one on classic and got it to about 30. Then decided to take a break and try something new. 
---
Rolled hunter, and it feels like the game is on easy mode now. Gonna have a hard time going back to the rogue...
---
They never gave game time for DDoS.  Just when their own servers had issues.
---
Alright thanks! I feel so weak at my level so I kinda figured I cant do dungeons yet
---
Yes you can definitely. And you should.
---
Its NeatPlates
---
I heard you wanted some more water, bread and shitty lowlevel health potions!
---
I believe it caps at 2.5 levels.
---
Finding a vulnerability and being able to execute on it are wildly different things.
---
You should run scarlet Monastery a couple times get a few levels then alternate between station highlands and STV. Or just keep grinding SM
---
They would have been fine if blizz left Holy Strike in.
---
Southshore
---
Mara has so many hunter drops it's unreal. Plus it's impossible to find a group for...
---
How many scrollable actrion bars (bottom left) can I have ? Is it possible to have more than 2?
---
I do not appreciate the tone you are taking. As if the entire player base is dumb and you are the only one who can see the light.
---
Expansions do not delete your character. Some of your gear may quickly become outdated, but that does not erase the hours spent grinding rare recipes, grinding rep, mounts acquired, honor rank, cosmetic pets acquired, and an endless amount of things I can not think of.
---
Expansions do not erase your character, they open the doors for further progress.
---
FORCED DELETIONS OF CHARACTERS is the worst fucking idea I have ever heard in my life. It is how you run a company into the fucking ground. No amount of preaching and condescending attitude turns it into a good idea. From hear on out I will assume you are just trolling, because no one is simultaneously this arrogant and wrong at the same time without it being on purpose. Have a nice day and go fuck yourself
---
Is that Samus?
---
One more tip regarding leveling a Rogue:
---
Consider ditching the daggers for swords/ maces and going Combat spec. You might feel weak with daggers because it's hard to Backstab/ Ambush when your enemy is in your face. Swords will make your Sinister Strike and Eviscerate hit a lot harder. Once you are higher level you can go back to daggers with an Assassination or Subtlety spec.
---
Good luck!
---
You know... i hate to be that guy - but i was wondering when id start seeing these posts. Blizzard just said they were going to crack down on people who abused bugs and exploited layering. Wonder if that is the email they are using for these bans? When blizzard says they are going to drop the hammer and you dont see these kinds of posts it makes you wonder if they did anything.
---
Yeah nerf was in 2.0 (BC)
---
I got to 45 on mage before rerolling druid. Druid is now lvl 25 and I'm enjoying it far more than I did the mage.
---
It's worth the reroll if you don't like playing a class that everyone plays!
---
Maraudon will be your friend for many many many runs
---
You will never find satisfaction in life. 
---
You make it.

Bye.
---
700g is 700g.
---
But how did a kid set up an actual distributed attack?
---
“High effort post”
---
Oh ok, so like the Nords and Stormcloaks
---
Hillsbrad, Stranglethorn Vale, Arathi Highlands, grind mobs for a couple of levels and make some gold for your mount at 40. In your level range from 30 to about the low forties it's actually much quicker to level by grinding mobs supplemented by questing versus focusing solely on quests. Find a humanoid mob around your level and just kill them until you level, you'll get a lot of cloth and make at least a gold or two just by looting them not to mention the grey and green item drops.
---
OMG I’ll never I see
---
I'm Horde scum. I detest Alliance scum.
---
He will have thousands upon thousands of $ in fines. Like more fines than ever. Potential lawsuits but will prolly just get probation unless he isn’t a first offender.
---
If they charge him in federal he would do at least a year in fed Parisian. Honestly can’t say much without seeing the charges.
---
Your best bet is to find another pc/laptop and use the windows 10 media creation tool to create a bootable usb recovery drive.
---
Boot from the usb media storage device and upon entering the installation setup hit Shift+F10 to being up command prompt and begin to format using diskpart to reinstall windows.
---
Follow these steps after you launch command prompt and start at step 2.
---
[Format in command prompt](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/format-hard-drive-command-prompt,37632.html)
---
After you're done, close command prompt and go back into the installation process, select your drive and install windows
---
I'm terrible at tutorials, but I hope this can get you started
---
Shhh....
---
Like 2 years*
---
True,..
---
I would prioritize faction balance over pop but that’s personal preference. 
---
The only thing worse than low pop is that during peak times they’re mostly of the opposing faction. Makes leveling a nightmare.
---
&gt; no one is simultaneously this arrogant and wrong at the same time
---
And you're the one trying to convince me that useless recipes and cosmetic items somehow prove your progression is *respected*. 
---
**Lol, hows that Crusader enchant working out for you in BfA?**
---
This has got to be the main one. It's not just that there's a lot of players, it's that all those players are running super long distances with no movement speed effects and what else are you going to do besides shitpost in chat?
---
Unless Blizz decides to combine pvp and pve servers together for battlegroups. The Ally heavy pve servers may balance out the queues with the Horde heavy pvp servers.
---
Ok Tobias Funke
---
Parry has no effect on your rage or energy. It's pretty common for people to take 5/5 parry as warrior because it's a nice bonus and the dps loss of the rend/dw/impale line is pretty minor. It won't be a huge difference either way though.
---
Do you have any idea how many calories are consumed to light a fire spell?  They probably need 200k a day just to maintain.
---
to me it sounded like he was kind of the "PR guy" for a botnet. He wasn't acting alone. He was basically advertising "this is what we can do" for potential customers.
---
Friend of mine got the same epic twice too. Helm of Narv though. Which is currently worth less than 20g.
---
So, basically, what I just said, cool
---
I'd also support maybe higher level additions for existing dungeons. like a Lower RFC where you go deeper into the chasm or another portion of Wailing Caverns. Or potentially even reworking some of the dungeons to be more difficult with more boss mechanics etc.
---
they could easily start pushing out classic+ content in as little as a month after starting development if they wanted to.  not that they'd want to.
---
Thanks! Yeah it seems I'll have to choose a dedicated character for gear, which tbh I'd prefer, it just makes you more committed to the character. For the pvp gear, am I able to grind that out with my characters, get them the rank/gear and will it not be lost from not playing?
---
I think the party disbands when there's no one online.
---
This needs to be on blast so more dumb kiddies don’t decide to throw away their lives for a “prank” that lasts a matter of hours
---
He is farming gold. Can you be more specific about what you insinuate when you say "farm gold" in this context?
---
No. Try not to be too offended mr hunter but you should be auto shooting not wasting mana on arcane shot.
---
i noticed this last week
---
Yeah I got the same thing with the tower in the east of goldzhire
---
It’s early.  You’ll have time to gear your chars.  When you say PvP do you mean battlegrounds or do you mean the 2v2?
---
Same but alliance tbh
---
Hundred of thousands in fines/payback. At least a year in federal prison if from the USA. Some country’s will give you 20+ years for doing a ddos attack. Depends on location etc
---
I did a bunch of grinding in whatever areas I quested in/near and a few SMGY runs from 30-35. 
---
...But as a Warlock orange quests aren't that bad so idk how easily you can consistently kill 3-4 level higher mobs regularly with your class/gear if you don't have a good area for easier quests
---
Bigger mana pool.  More Arcane Shot crits.  If I was in that instance I would definitely roll on it, as it has Agi.  Casters don't use Agi at all.  The belt is clearly meant for hybrids and hunters.
---
From Deadmines, Cruel Barb's at 19 will last you until 39, then you'll want to run RFD for the quest sword, and SM for the sword or dagger
---
Dunno. I just grind mobs.
---
dumb fuck
---
In that thread, lol: "Lifelong jail for making me suffer a few hours of no BfA, plz."
---
The man did you a favor.
---
I'm sitting on a server like the one you came from.
---
I forgot layering being removed might make this one rather unpleasant to be on in a month or two.
---
Go to a pve server? Or level in dungeons.
---
You get one bubble of rest every 8 hours, there are 20 bubbles per level. You can have a max of 30 bubbles stored up which takes 10 days to reach.
---
My condolences.
---
Interesting I'll see what I can get, yeah I've been trying to do a dagger build I seen online. Is it too late to spec out of what I have going on? I have spent all of my talent points but I dont want my rerolling to get super expensive
---
Have you heard of a little known class called the Paladin?
---
I've played PvP servers since the very beginning, and don't have any interest in pve. I don't mind dying, I don't really even get bothered by the huge faction imbalance. It's the fact that it's pushing more alliance players away every day that is actually bothering me.
---
On the alliance side, there’s a quest to get murloc heads from killing murlocs, the drop rate is not 100 percent.
---
Okay I'll check that out, thanks!
---
At your level on alliance I’m pretty sure you’re good to go for deadmines but I only play horde so I could be mistaken. But I do know if you’re a rogue you want the chest that drops from van cleef, it is just insane.
---
I’ll buff in the field. Less in cities or towns unless I see someone leaving. My guess is you’re either around people’s alts or super casuals at that level.
---
Proof?
---
Someone lied to you.
---
I forget which one, but I know you can craft all of one of the specialities and then switch to the other while keeping the old stuff. You'll have to look it up though.
---

I mean its just coming over from retail, all the serious players are going horde.

As a citizen of Kurrinaxx, what is it about that server you dislike?
---
you got lucky.
---
Southshore. Feralas (Feathermoon on the far West island). Badlands. STV.

There's a lot of changing zones around the 30's unfortunately.

No they aren't, if that's actually how I defined a joke.

Is your motto to only preserve jokes you find humorous?

So they don’t go for that much. Lol

In vanilla the rank simply allows you to buy the gear, there's no restriction on the gear that you need to maintain. So if you hit rank 10 you can always use that gear once bought.

I’ve been hearing we might not even have bgs for almost a year so tbh I’m pretty sure classic is gonna last a while.

Is there something specifically that makes you think he built his own?
---
He got caught in less than 2 weeks so he did a terrible job obscuring his identity.  Other ddosers have taken longer to track down.  He couldn't even lookup the US realm list IP's he literally asked for them on Twitter.  He certainly didn't seem mature nor organized unlike some other group efforts like Lizard Squad.  He was also just one person so it seems less likely he would have established a botnet by himself but obviously it's possible with the knowhow... Just doesn't seem like he knew much from the info we have so far.

Spoken like a true Huntard

The way I see it is every class is good for something at max level. So pick the class with your favorite class fantasy and stick with it.

The whole place is full of Turtles (best), Basilisks, Scorpids, and Vultures. They all drop decent greys to sell, though the Turtles tend to be favored.

Dude there's a reason TBC was filled with fap weapons, your weapon's damage didn't matter while shapeshifted.

Yeah, glove compartments. I think they have to be lockable here? I can’t recall correctly.

The keyboard is Bluetooth and the mouse is connected though that little cable you see on my phone. I can't remember the name of the cable but it's basically USB type c to USB female. That holds the reveiver for the mouse.

Multi box Shaman and Paladin at the same time? That's some 4D chess move.

Funny, I bet if the joke had been about someone you dislike you would have never posted.

There are a multitude of jokes on Reddit every day a out Donald Trump or some Republican dropping the soap in prison with thousands of upvotes.

Requires more preperation. Less room for error. They're great 5 man tanks though.

You'll be viable but not optimal. Most guilds that aren't high end will take feral druids into raids as long as the raider is consistent and brings consumables (MCP mainly).

I love my realm. Even the horde have been fun.

there where in the AH for 5gold on our server , obliviously  i did not get them
---
Good BoP daggers are hard to come by. Swords are superior for levelling but if you would prefer playing daggers i would buy some main hand greens to keep up your damage.  
---
Don't stress too much about saving literally every silver and copper at early levels, even if you decide to spend 50s or 1g now you can make that up at lvl 35-40 in 1/5th the time it took you to make it now.
---
Here it’s 3-6g for a stack of 8 unfortunately. I saw someone selling a 3x8 stack for 10g a few days ago. Seems like a lot to spend on when I can maybe get ravaged in 2 levels
---
Off Emp atm

horde: *attacks* get fucked lmao
---
ally: the fuck are they doing? *squints* eh, who cares
---
“(My highest lvl char btw)” weird flex but ok
---
Whoa! No reason to go that extreme with the punishment.
---
as far as I know the portals never led anywhere, that they were placeholders for a possible emerald dream expansion. there will be a dragon there at some point in the phases
---
when they stop developing retail because no matter how big blizz gets they can only work on one game at a time.
---
id say they are in the middle of whatever next expansion they are making
---
One early respec won’t kill you, and I think things will be a lot smoother for you if you do make the switch. I would wait until you have some decent swords to switch to (like, not white) and then pull the trigger on the respec
---
Should have changed it to frosty@frosty.com after the fact

No not cars. But trucks, yes, a lot of them

Don't take breaks
---
that raw attack power is nuts for feral druid in cat form, unless you can find something that totals above 34ATK power (+3 str +6stam) for level 30.
---
Good luck explaining that to a blue pill tryhard.
---
Yeah, I've got 2 hunters horde and alliance and when I'm on my alliance the horde seem to mindlessly tank more often.
---
The Alliance was *very* peaceful with their neighbors.

It's really not that much to ask when they have infrastructure there ready. That sucks.
---
I hate the word skill. It really doesn't apply to something like this. There are more accurate words. Anyway, he didn't have the knowledge, understanding or expertise required to pull of something like this. He thought he was more "skilled" than he actually is and so he got caught within a few days.
---
Running SM yields me a really great amount of Silk cloth
---
I feel like you should stick to your warlock, as they have decent PvP potential; I don't know if just slightly switching your mechanism of damage (dots/bolts/fears vs burst/shocks/bolts), while both still being casters, is worth the change and time investment. As a shaman, you'll probably need to respec resto often for PVE (it's very hard to only PvP and be geared, I believe, and ele PvE may not really be sought after). And this is my opinion as someone rolling the 30/0/21 ele PvP shaman haha.
---
Just isn’t goldshire without erp in the chat
---
Funny. I also rolled on an RP server for a change of pace.
---
Sorry noob, SM?
---
Yeah enh is an example of something that was really fixed by tbc. Comparing tbc enh to vanilla enh the latter just does nothing.
---
Warlocks, if you're looking for a caster. They stand their ground very well I'm leveling, but I can't promise anything for instances.
---
Obviously they didn’t say “lul sucks kid!” But they they acknowledged that I lost the item due to the attacks but wouldn’t replace it.
---
That's not how it works. Classic has its own team. They have nothing to do with retail expansions.
---
Okay awesome. Although what does main hand greens mean? Like green dagger in my main hand?
---
It also makes you run through normally impassable crevices where you then get stuck.

The insane amount of random BS from his past that he always recalls with full first and last names is comically terrible...

That's the whole point of me posting this - I could have 10,000 more tries in the same situation and it would never go down like this again.  Believe me, I damn near shit my pants to see it happen

I was that hunter in OG vanilla. No ragrets - I remember freaking the fuck out so much I woke my family up.
---
Sure it's good, just not sure where a long long time comes in considering a late thirties green hammer of the tiger will give you +12 agi and str which is worth more.

No, all of my 6 characters are pretty secure about their class choices.

SM stands for Scarlet Monastery. It’s a dungeon in Tirisfal divided in four wings.

You might be weeks behind some people but youll still be equal with and weeks ahead of other people! Unless you're feeling pressure to lvl to max and raid then slow it down and enjoy the journey.

Right, so he's saying as a tailor make a bunch of low level items to disenchant if you'd like, instead of trying to farm low level items themselves.
---
I wonder if they’re going to come to aid of The Kyle Clan to help take down the The Great Drywall Fortress.

From what I saw of his Twitter, he was demonstrating the power of the botnet he was using, which is usually what you do when you wanna gain a reputation and sell access to it. I don't have any proof though.
---
Thank you man ! Imma probly hit it tnrw then if I can, lvl 29
---
That is fucked. Its a damn PVP server for fuck sake. I would keep putting in tickets and raise hell on the Forums. Someone over stepped.
---
Same thing for Shadow Priests. Super scary when fully buffed, but we can't even afford to put Fortitude + Shadowform on at half mana, let alone heal up and Inner Fire.
---
Looking forward to an update, that's dumb (even if you are alliance scum lol)
---
Were you in a place where the guards evade out and can’t reach you?
---
Well America did have a bloody revolt against Britain who said they weren't allowed to have guns  
---
  
---
and one of the first things Nazi Germany did was take guns out of Jewish hands  
---
So sure America's love of guns can be weird if you don't look at history and only get fed your world view by modern day news corporations 
---
I'm sure the massive Argentina protests would be a bit more different if they had access to guns. Argentinians are starving.
---
Yay there’s hope for us shadow priests :)
---
Im not much for writing but everything here was so incredibly lucky that I had to share.  I'm glad you enjoyed it

It was.  But we play on patch 1.12 here not patch 1.1

Damn this is stupid af. It’s a pvp server. There should be some way to combat their decision.

I'm a lvl 38 rogue and I have 2 cruel barbs that I've been using
---
Basically what they're saying is that if you're solo leveling as a warrior the most efficient way (fastest way) to level is to download a swing timer, use a 2h weapon, and hamstring kite mobs around while turning around to hit them whenever your auto attack is ready. Further, dual wield is good at endgame when you have the gear to max it's damage potential, but any time before that it's way behind 2h's efficiency. 
---
I don't care how you play, enjoy yourself, blah blah blah. I'm just trying to explain why they're saying what they're saying.
---
Damn what brought you here then?
---
Hax
---
And none of those people would be there without the other 4.

What the hell happened to "There is a PVP solution"

I'm gonna assume there's more to the story than what he's sharing.

Why don’t paladins tank MC?
---
I bet he actually got caught within days
---
Person in question posted regular updates at fairly short intervals on his now suspended twitter account. 
---
They would say something like... "NA servers going down soon!" and ten minutes later all the servers were down.
---
He literally posted about everything he was doing as he was doing it or right before it happened.
---
I was reading his twitter that Saturday and he mentioned that he was going to take down the eu pvp servers next. Someone replied and asked him to only target NA servers and he agreed since he didn't want to hurt his EU bros
---
Kinda wild that just asking actually worked

People take this shit to seriously.

Got a bad group? So leave and find another.

Fuck that hunter. That trinket gives him just about +2dps. 
---
They're a shitbag if they did that, bis my ass.
---
A quick google search into my own class tells me that you are wrong. Why did you even respond if you intended to be condescending?
---
I doesn't have it yet but it will soon :), I'm working on a bunch of updates this weekend. I'm going to add a list so you can add and remove people without having to target them. I'm also going to add a notes section so you can make a note that will pop up briefly when you target someone like a quick note of "bad healer, don't group!!" 
---
You're totally welcome to wait to download it, I'll make another post on Reddit when I do update it :)
---
No, but attacking corporate servers is a federal crime. They went after wikipedia and twitch too. You don't fuck with Amazon and Acti-Blizz and get to walk away. These are multi-billion dollar companies with unlimited resources.

We make a boring piece of industry software, well known in the given sector, but otherwise not. It's sold as a SAAS model similar to WoW.  We have a huge development team working on 2020 releases, a smaller one working on 2021 initiatives, and a teeny-tiny, exporatory one working on 2022 and the future beyond.  
---
Most software companies are 2-4 years ahead of what's on the shelf right now... and while not every project will see the light of day (in fact, most will not), you can bet they have a highly detailed roadmap.  The phones that Apple and Google launched recently were worked on before last year's models even came out.
---
Mana efficiency. There's a sweet spot where your spellpower actually scales better with lower rank spells per mana spent than the highest rank. If you need to give someone a big heal then by all means you use your highest rank, but if you're just topping someone up, lower ranks will give you more bang for your buck.
---
please do not hit on bonk

It would be rude not to.

you see those stars up there man? did you know they're all... dead?
---
Census data uses /who which sees all layers. Only one person on each server faction needs to run census for it to capture valid results at a given hour.  The stat you care about is not total unique characters but peak time total actives.
---
Gotta grind grind grind. Fuck other activities, “I’m not 60 yet”
---
Am I doing the best to further my characters progression at every minute of the day?!
---
For fucks sake, relax, it’s rehashed content. Nothing is forcing you to 60 ASAP. If you wanna spend a night wpvping in badlands, grab a guildie and get out there for a few hours.
---
so strange to me that work companies would block the WoW forums but not reddit. Unless your company does social media stealth marketing or something, surely the 19th largest website whose only purpose is time wasting should be higher priority for blocking?
---
Maybe the IT guys want to use reddit but know they cant justify the wow forums??

WHY HE WAS MAKING CLASSIC WOW AUTHENTIC
---
I'm a level 23 Tauren warrior. Thinking of doing WC until 30, what's the next dungeon that I would be able to do or when I hit 30, the best place to quest?
---
Okay cool that makes sense, thank you!
---
...seriously though
---
No, I'm not. I gank before/after Gurubashi fights for a little while, but it is never over an hour.
---
i dropped gnomish engi to relevel for goblin engi so i could get all the specialization specific items, took me about 20g to get back up to ~250 engi. really not too bad at least with the current economy.
---
Which is interested because I specifically reported this in the beta. Guess it’s not a priority hah.
---
Every single horde hunter I've come across has ganked me. Every single one. Hunters deserve everything they get.
---
In your analogy, the commandeering of a thousand autonomous cars would require some hacking, no? This guy didn't hack blizzard but being in control of a botnet requires pwning a bunch of shitty Chinese IP cameras or something at the very least.
---
Fuck dude you need to quit the mage hate and realise the game should always be about having fun. You sound entitled af talking about willful poor play- these players might not know better, and like it or not aoe is a huge part of the mages toolkit. Have you tried talking to these people and asking nicely, or do you just use the tone you have been using in this response? No one needs a sensitive tank who can't roll with a few punches now and then and can't react to a bit of chaos, some of the most fun you can have in wow is living through the hairy moments together as a group. You are making anecdotal sweeping generalizations stemming from saltiness about aoe farming, and that's blizzards fault, not the players
---
Take the computer shit out of it. Lots of dumbass people ruin their lives all the time by making stupid choices with big consequences. idiots rob a convenient store for $20 in the till.
---
You have 6 total, but you can place 4 of them outside the normal action bar as "extra" action bars, leaving you with just two left to scroll through. Which you seem to have already done. If you take off one of your right action bars you should get a third to scroll to.
---
Prot pally legit.

Pull everything, AoE everything. Profit.

Classic feels great.
---
Are you on Sulfuras?

I am lvling my rogue (25 ATM) at 19 I got cruel barb from DM and went combat, I think my killspeed tripped or more. It is more boring because u just spam sinister strike but worth running it a few times till u get it imo.
---
The extra xp Will make it easier to find. Smooth questing router after aswell.
---
Agree, Just camera clipping. Not a big deal.
---
I put 3 stacks on the AH at any given time.  Ignorant me out 8 stacks on one time and it definitely tanked the value.
---
Nah 18-30 is like that for horde too. It’s back and forth between barrens, stonetalon, ashenvale, hillsbrad, thousand needles, etc. Each zone with no more than 3, 4 tops quests to do at a time before having to leave again. It’s terrible.
---
I feel sorry for alliance they are so less ganky than horde.  So many times they run by without causing any problems.
---
I don’t see the dipshit out there bragging or disputing it, which he would absolutely be doing if he wasn’t caught or running scared absolutely shitless.
---
Sentinel's aren't as hood as Archers
---
given that bloodvine is still three whole phases away, that's really not that bad.
---
He actually puts a ton of effort and thought into his stream which i respect a ton.
---
Doesn't take much to run a scan against a server cluster and find out it is vulnerable and then point a botnet at the cluster. Literally any 10 year old with daddy's credit card could do this.
---
Couple of things here. In an addons .toc file, the author specifies what version of wow it is compatible with. The 'out of date' flag is entirely based on this number - if it doesn't match the current version of wow it will show as 'out of date'. It's nothing more clever than that. 
---
The issue is you can only specify one version number and for some addons, the exact same addon used in retail works just fine in classic - but they use different version numbers. If the author only wants to release one version of their addon that works in both, it's always going to show as 'out of date' in one of the versions of wow.
---
It would appear OmniCC is one of those - I just tested and the 'classic' download from curse still has the 'retail' version number.
---
Somebody has put a version on wowinterface where they have changed the version number so you don't get the 'out of date' warning but at this point it's now older than the current version on curse, so you're probably better sticking with the curse version and just ticking 'load out of date addons'. It's a spurious warning, it's just because it's using the retail version number.
---
Hope this makes sense!
---
So just
---
This has been my life for the past couple of evenings. And will likely be a chunk of my weekend. Hope to see you all there!
---
I give it to warriors, paladins, hunter pets, and voidwalkers.
---
You don't need 5 people.  Now I had full BWL gear at the time but I could solo it on my rogue back 15 years ago. 
---
2-3 rogues could kill him easily.  You just chain evasion tank.
---
there was a mod that let you change  models, it was client side only so only you could see the difference,  so you could be a undead but have the model of a human. but you could also change other models like make the mining node 400% larger so you could see it from further away
---
Im really curious where he is from.
---
Nah, he's thinking of [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Mxn2W9-3KeQ/maxresdefault.jpg) which is more of a doodad testing area. The scrapped "Old Outland" zone was on a totally different map ID.

There's a quest line in duskwood that ends with killing a level 35 elite. If you can get help to finish this one he gives you a nice sword Archeous 63-95 3.30 23.9 DPS chance on hit: blasts a target for 85 arcane damage

Punishment should be equal to the damage done.  While the damage per person of this act wasn't that bad, the bottom line is it affected a ton of people.  These kind of cyber attacks should be punished extremely hard as they can cause tons of damage.  What if you DDoS some other vital public service and lives are lost?  It's like Swatting.  People do a lot of this crap and think it's not a big deal because it's "online" but there are ramifications.
---
My wife had similar problems.  I found 2 issues... First of all the cpu was overheating.  Thermal paste was gone and heat sink was clogged with dust.  Also, a couple fans weren't working so I installed new ones.  Go to boot up and... Flash of light from the fans (nice purple!) and then nothing. 
---
Power supply was weak and on its way out.  Thankfully had warranty, but ordered her a new one and all was well, and we have a backup power supply!
---
So yea, couple things to check if it's going down under load.  Lots of heat is bad and will cause things to shut down to avoid destruction.
---
Yesterday I was legit getting 1v2d by a warlock in Arathi. If he got the fear off, I’d be full dotted and running around picking up aggro on 4 raptors for 15 seconds. Actually absurd. I’m convinced Warlocks are the best world PvP class after that.
---
“would of“ is something that, in my experience, only native American English get wrong. It is really simple syntax, of doesn't make any sense here and is solely because of the sound in some dialects. Loose just looks so right, because the pronunciation is so fucked. Hose, rose, dose, lose...wtf. :) I know loose is wrong if I would proofread though.

To be fair, the only time a mage should be not casting instants in pvp is when he is sure he can’t be interrupted. 
---
So if he has rooted a warrior in a 1v1, for example. 
---
Further there is elemental spec which is pretty much designed around using every instant cast in your arsenal.
---
Dying to a mage who didn’t hard cast may be a sign you faced a decent mage..but it’s probably mostly indicative of your low health pool. Cause even in elemental spec you will scorch if safe to do so.
---
Frequently ganking on a PvP server is 100% allowed. I don't target specific people. There is no more to the story, mate.

Yeah I'll see if I can get barb, thanks!

If you’re leveling at BM than this how is amazing. In TBC leveling as BM I used it until I got to the outlands and it easily beat everything up until then. However, if you’re running MM, it would be better just to sell it.

I don't think you really can do wc til 30, you'll stop getting experience from it before then. You should also look at doing shadowfang keep and blackfathom deeps until then.
---
At 30 you can do razorfen kraul, and then gnomeregan.
---
Google dramatic
---
No way you get a tip if we're doing a dungeon as a group. You are the water machine just like the locks are the cookie machine and the druids are the MotW machines. If you give it out in the world that's the different story.
---
First one I could find was greater maul, which is 41 and of the tiger gives +12 or +13 to both stats. A little high, at level 30 you're probably looking at 8 to 9. So viscous is a little better than a green at the same level, but certainly not going to be better for that long especially once you get heart of the wild in your late thirties which makes strength a chunk better than pure attack power as a stat.

with a fishing bot?
---
You can dual weild cruel barbs without any issues? (duplicate bop items)
---
Right now classic is surpassing every expectation blizzard had. They have at least doubled the server amount if not more. So it must be bringing in good amount. 
---
Aw
---
That's one way to stand out!
---
Tweet it at blizzardcs and say what happened to pvp solutions
---
Theres a rwtail wow sub for a reason.  Ask your retail questions there.
---
Nice dude
---
They should add an NPC into "Stockade" instance with his name, and give him 5HP like the other critters.
---
Cool story bro. Doesnt make america's abusive relationship with guns any less weird and tragic on top of that. But at this point, its probably too late to change it anyway. Just keep that to yourself.
---
dont forget to change flair to solved!
---
Fury should still level with two-handed weapons. Dual Wielding is viable, but not recommended.
---
Yeah and its not even about the games. Its that she doesn't respect your hobbies. Its a bigger relationship problem. The only time this would be justifiable is if OP was a complete shutin who was ruining his life with gaming. But if its a hobby his wife is just being shitty.
---
Here are 20 servers...  Ooops we mean 80 servers. Sorry. No not a success at all....
---
Is this one of those things where new couples say "You hang up first." "No, you!"? I promise I won't leave you if you don't leave me.
---
And even still it’s more targeted than whispering every unguided player on the server.
---
🦀🦀btw🦀🦀
---
Suck my ass
---
I'm getting so tired of the aoe mage farming bullshit.  I just wanna tell people like that to go back to retail
---
I honest-to-fuck tried to mouselook to the left after those guys passed to see if they were going to attack.
---
Duh. He used the same email he registered for his 1337 haxor group to his personal FB if I understand correctly.
---
Can't wait for his "about to check out these prison showers =)))))" tweet
---
The thing that hits you after the death coil.
---
oh, weird. makes sense then
---
I feel this depends a lot on the country and how good of an actual hacker you are. If you are skilled enough any country would use the prison sentence to press you into a more productive use of your skills for them. Talents talent and every government could use more skilled tech people.
---
This guy though? I doubt he is good enough to warrant waving the sentence and giving him a job, just like that one you linked.
---
what is a good +healing for a priest to be able to start raiding MC? at the moment i have a few points under 400 +healing, is this enough?
---
I'm hoping this happened because your victims reported you and the auto-flagger took you down. Either way, really fucking stupid and I really hope you're back online soon. I've spent the better part of this past week getting killed by jerks glitching ontop of the Gadgetzan Arena, but I'm not out here trying to get them suspended.
---
 I guess we can't go back to 2004 after all.
---
I’m not looking to PvP yet, let me quest and fuck with each other at the end.
---
The only people that use guns are people that are hunting.  Sorry to burst your bubble.  Hes also not wrong.  You are.
---
In legion they were turned into druid portals that lead to the dreamgrove!
---
Alliance, not even once
---
I did fine DW from 20 - 34 when I got the ww axe. Not a min maxxer.
---
No shoes on the right
---
No shit. Anyone in their 20s who takes gaming seriously is on the spectrum.
---
Paladin *laughs in autoattack*
---
Yeah, I'm hoping it was just an auto-ban as well. Maybe they'll rethink it staying in game :)
---
Oh, but I don't think you can disenchant crafted items.
---
Can confirm that Texas is a thing.
---
ITT people applying real world morals to a fantasy land where dead things come back to life in 5 minutes.
---
Same. My teen self would've gone dwarf priest for fear ward.
---
My adult self went Nelf priest because they look cooler and I hate short races in fantasy.
---
And sometimes you quote a balding, petulant manchild for karma.
---
And here I am, a holy pala, buffing everyone (and their pets) every 5 mins
---
Oh look at Mr. I Did SM GY and all is well. Try to run Armory and Cathedral with your setup without being overleveled and still 'make decent time'. And wait until you get to Uldaman. I dare you to not skip Uldaman. I double dare you!
---
Right at night or you lookin for a fight.
---
No doubt it’s a success, but it’s also the new-old kid on the block. The key is, what does the 3-6-12 month retention look like? 
---
Blizzard knows exactly how many accounts have max level characters, how many people cancel after 2 months, how many never play but pay every month, how many play retail because classic had them re-subscribe... behind the alliance and horde, dragons, beautiful world and epics— just a business.
---
It’s a cyber attack. Yes.
---
I disagree this is the greatest hacker the world has ever seen.  Makes Mr Robot look like a noob
---
2h is best. Alot of the warrior skills scale off weapon damage rather than dps/attack speed
---
Yup fuck that kid.
---
It's not about being Horde or Alliance. It's about hating the other team, whoever they might be!
---
It is a TOS violation for more than one person to use an account though.
---
Get good and show those hardcore no gooders how neckbeardy you can really be
---
research your class, raids, consumables, do dungeons with them and link the dps metres everytime you top (which should be all the time if you swear enough) force them to love you. They will adopt you like their son and you will become the champion they never knew they needed
---
I misread the meme god fucking damnit
---
This is fucking disgusting xD
---
The play is to be the honest guy and loot insta. Then collect the two pieces and hand them out to the two top rolls. 
---
Top rolls gets the more valuable to vendor item, 2nd highest gets the other.
---
If you’re honest and you’re not trying to be the chest looter—you’re fucking up.
---
Yeah, don't fuck with it. They'll drive themselves half way into the grave with bad Kindergarten tier games for Adults over a 10 year span instead while being prodded by Activision.
---
Idk I replaced it with Ice Metal Barbute for that plate armor
---
&gt; I think leveling a warrior as an alt is a good idea because you can farm gold for an hour on your level 60 and be able to outfit your alt to the nines, making leveling easier and more enjoyable.
---
I concur.
---
I levelled my warrior as an alt back in vanilla. It was so much more enjoyable when I was able to fully suit up my warrior and steamroll through things.
---
Totally. I guess my point is that this dude didn't just rob a 7-11 where he'd quite possibly get away with it.  
---
This dude attacked two enormous global internet organizations.  There's no chance he'd getting away.
---
rofl thats bullshit, was doing that for few hours with myself and few friends but didn't get any ban thank god
---
Yes I have indeed. Ty for the answer!
---
no you didn't, you weren't the one special dude who got through the mess
---
On non paladins, sure. On paladins it's hilarious though.
---
If the joke is shit then sure, but when you say it's in very poor taste it suggests that you think the joke is shit because you think like a 5 year old.
---
Anyone offended by "dropping the soap" jokes is pretty pathetic dude. The entire notion of dropping a bar of soap and getting raped simply for being bent over is completely cartoonish and absurd, and actually contradicts the prevalent thought that rape is about power.
---
There are so many layers of absurdity in that joke that it blows my mind that anyone would relate it to reality and become offended.
---
No one is going to get raped in prison by a gang of video game players for DDOSing a video game server, so you can lay down for a bit and take a breather.
---
Just give me the death penalty tbh.
---
That’s telekinesis Kyle!
---
This is always everyone else's luck
---
Was worried about this myself but it turned out to be the exact opposite. People on my server will /who and send me random whispers asking me to join their groups daily
---
How do we know it was the same kid who did Wikipedia?
---
Cheers!
---
100% pre talent rework bear tanking was *not* viable.  Thankfully, Classic is post rework and Dire Bear Form has 360% armor, not 180%.
---
My point is just that people are literally stuck in an *ancient* mindset that wasn't even relevant when Vanilla was out.  Here we are 15 years later, and people who *still* have no idea what they're talking about, which would be fine, if people weren't so fanatical about their opinions.
---
Just before Onyxia raid too, feelsbad considering my name :(
---
I hope they give him the chair
---
A lot of people really, really want to dispute the idea that we were just bad. A lot of people also really want to put all the blame on our toasters. Playing with a cpu the speed of a modern calculator certainly didn't help. But. We were just really bad.
---
I play both factions so I don't participate in the autistic faction hating all over this sub
---
There is a trick to resetting Maraudon without hearthing or committing suicide. It involves having a 6th person form a raid group, getting them to reset the instance while everyone logs out, and then having everybody come back in, which resets everybody to the instance entrance.
---
Is this kosher, or is this a bannable offense in Blizzard's eyes?
---
Yeah true it's only the first month so it's basically the peak amount of players still. 
---
Kind of off topic but "business" is also what makes a lot of games trash. 
---
This micro transaction era has shown that a game can be trash and still earn a lot of money.
---
doesnt look massive to me
---
I feel so lucky to have creamed with all of you.
---
Don't worry about falling behind, the majority of people is currently between 30-40.
---
Try to run some dungeons to hype up the solo questing grind.
---
Yes. Thorns only for people in battle as I'm passing or people in a small town obviously turning in a quest and heading back out.
---
level with 5% crit from fury to start out then the rest in arms, use a 2H and keep a 1h/shield around to swap into to use shield bash. you're gonna get shitty RNG at low levels since you're mostly standng around waiting for a weapon to swing. 2 misses in a row and you will barely kill shit at level, sometimes it's better to use whichever weapon is best because a good 1h will do more damage than a not good 2h. around  30+ you'll just wanna use a 2h and get that warrior quest axe asap (you'll need help from level 35-40 players)
---
It's a level 13 staff
---
Oh well. :)
---
as a pally while im waiting for the boat I bubble and kill a lowbie and skull of imdending doom (sprint) away. sometimes get a bunch of them and get away from guards. I'm hoping theres more to the story would be stupid as hell if thats considered griefing or harrassment
---
Fuck this guy in particular.
---
I blasted through that book pretty much the minute it got to me until I was done later that afternoon. 
---
Great read. It’ll make you shake your head at anyone who ever tells a dev “it’s a 5 minute fix”
---
I’ve called my fiancé’s dog Trash Mouth for so long now lol
---
Those changes happen while playing those expansions, not during the early leveling. Every character starts during cataclysm, then mysteriously travel back in time to  TBC and WoTLK, then start seeing glimpses of storylines of each expansion, since you aren't able to finish a single zone before you're over that level bracket and is forced to move to the next, except WoD, which you're actually forced to play through the boring slog.
---
I played vanilla in a hardcore raiding guild and retired in 2007. I came back for classic and it’s a near perfect copy of what I remember pre-BC expansion. 
---
That being said, I **love** the creature comforts of retail, and seeing how limited my time to game is, BFA’s 20-40m dungeons make much more sense than classic’s slower pace for everything.
---
I mean, your a bit of a douchebag since ganking lowbies is a part of your daily routine, but you definitely should not have been banned. To be fair, those lowbies are equally douchebags for reporting someone ganking them. Just a Dbag party over there.
---
Why? I do this all the time.
---
If they don't want it to happen they would put a timer on the NPCs or something.
---
How are you smart enough to know how to DDoS servers, but dumb enough not to make a dummy email?
---
That's too bad. It was pretty funny to be honest. A couple days of mild interruptions, God forbid you can't play for 17 hours straight.
---
scorpid sting would be sick if it stacked with other scorpid stings
---
LMAO
---
Good and bad are subjective.
---
The suggestions of adding expansions and stopping at some point are the same as the #nochanges
---
I never claimed that ganking lowbies isn't a shitty thing to do :)
---
Man, I didn’t know you could read douchenss, today I learned something.
---
Lmao right
---
Sadly the double specialization trick is bugged at the moment. Min maxers like me are sad.
---
no
---
For a mage I’d say the extra 120 mana from the first robe is more valuable than the extra 70 hp and tiny bit of increased regen on the second robe.
---
Yep.
---
How much time did you spend sitting on NPCs?
---
It's a video game mate. How tf can you be lazy.
---
I do the same thing with my younger brother. Sends me updates as my work day winds down lol
---
Yes there is you just need a friend to invite an alt char to invite to the party. When you want to reset just log out onto your alt and reset the instance then when you log back in you will be teleported to the beginning of the instance or in the case with mara at the beginning of where you get teleported when you use the scepter.
---
Wouldn't a fiddle of gold weigh hundreds of pounds?
---
I mean it seems rather simple dude, do u want mana/damage or health/survivabilyy
---
That sounds disgustingly hilarious.
---
You could level a mage/warlock/priest naked from 1-&gt;60 and all that would change is how much you have to stop to drink. Would like to see a rogue do that, that is gear dependency.
---
White damage and poison damage make up a massive portion of damage, even while questing. Once rank 2 SnD unlocked, it is very worthwhile keeping it up. Even if it's just 1 or 2 CB points at the start of the mob.
---
Haha, own it! While I dont do it myself, I do think having scumbag alliance dbags like you around is part of what makes this game great.
---
Confirmed. This is why you never spam direct damage on a feared target. Shadow bolt = broken fear.
---
There are vanilla paladins still in duels that started in 2004 outside ironforge. Both are at full health and mana.
---
I mean he's a rogue so not a whole lot they can do regarding guard evading. Would be interesting to see the other side of the story though as there inevitably is. From all op told us it certainly sounds dumb getting banned, but it's quite likely he skipped a few details.
---
Good of you to join us, Uther.
---
Insignia of the Alliance / Insignia of the Horde. It won’t be available until they release the pvp gear / battlegrounds phase for classic.
---
We're living in a society!
---
Clear MC/ony in 3-4h. The hardest part will be getting 60, then slowly work on your pre raid bis. Then move to raids.
---
Nope
---
your sf only crits 3k?  Weak sauce
---
Yes they can attack on a boat. And you just take rez sickness.
---
Out of curiosity, what about short races in fantasy particularly bothers you?
---
Man the amount of tankin I'm doin is crazy.
---
Let me rest...I'm so tired of holding mobs.
---
Who is holding me...

0 seconds.

I know you think you made a point here but you really didn't 
---
&gt; There are a multitude of jokes on Reddit every day about Donald Trump or some Republican dropping the soap in prison with thousands of upvotes. 
---
They never claimed to like the DDoSer and have given no reasonable indication to make that so this is both a strawman and a whataboutism - it is just as probable that they would make the same comments if you made that joke about Trump but even if they didn't being one group being immoral doesn't make it moral for everyone else to copy them. 
---
&gt; You just want to feel like you have some form of perceived moral high ground. A true White Knight of the internet. 
---
This is just a baseless insult 
---
&gt; If I need to explain the difference to you between an edgy joke and walking up to someone and calling them a racial slur, then who is the ignorant one? 
---
Dropping the soap in jail jokes stop being edgy around 12 years old and just show a childish demeanor. Also even if you did manage to make a real edgy joke and you had to describe how it differs from just spouting racial slurs, that doesn't necessarily make the person you had to describe the difference to ignorant, it is actually more probable that you are just terrible at writing a real edgy joke and instead just said something really ignorant with the intent for it to come off as a joke (this happens to real comedians all the time let alone people who thing drop the soap jokes are edgy). You would still be the ignorant person in that case.
---
Do you know why they got reworked?
---
A dwarf did this to tirisfal for the white bat, amazing how u want wat u can’t have
---
Get rekt cheater exploiter. Enjoy your ban. Imagine falling for this kids QQ. LOTS OF NEWBS ITT
---
Also idk I think you body will just be on the boat
---
Mess with the Tauren, you get the horns.
---
As opposed to shooting up a school of guilty kids and teachers.
---
Thank you!
---
The final boss drops a quest starter that rewards a green cloth shoulder
---
I’ve got 15 years in this game. Literally 600-700+ days of my life in this game since nov 04. 
---
I’ve got friends I play with who obviously have less. The sort of less that gets you leveling resto as a Druid and meleeing mobs down with your staff. 
---
That’s a level of bad I can’t ignore. I wish I could, but I can’t. If I’m in a dungeon on discord with these guys, I’ll try to stay calm but by the 5th time we were wiping cause the Druid was oom cause he spent his pool on moon fire and insect swarm, I get salty. 
---
When, instead, I’m not on discord and listening to music, and that same person is there...I’m tempered, I have to type out the message and press enter. And I just don’t hit send. I make a joke, or offer up a new method maybe they didn’t know (in this case, he had no concept of mana efficiency, I explained direct healing downranking, the 5 second rule, precasting. He was perceptive, tried his best the rest of the run and we didn’t wipe again.
---
If we’d been on discord together o woulda pissed him off and he woulda tuned me out long before I got to the point where I tried to teach him how to play. 
---
I’m not sure how this is strictly relevant, but that’s my tale.
---
Undead warrior ftw. Almost everything i kill is food.
---
I'm totally addicted to the AH aspects of the game. Currently just funding my cloth hand ins for other race epic mount by playing the AH in regards to devilsaur leathers and gear
---
I SEE PRIDE! I SEE POWER!
---
Thank you.
---
*cries in blacksmith. :x*
---
Imagine living in poo huts
---
I appreciate the extra advice. However, I ended up doing what some others said in the thread and just distracted them at their furthest point and was able to grab the egg and re-stealth without agroing at all. It did take me 2 tries but it was well worth it.
---
Barrens is fun
---
Well just ganking for hours on end won't get you banned. Trust me.
---
They reported you for something other than that.
---
If you message the GMs they will give you more info.
---
What did your heart rate spike up to?
---
Because anything that can hurt big corporations in any way is now criminal.
---
Hey 3 gold is 3 gold. That's leagues better than getting [Minor Health Potion] or [Soldier's Grieves] and some silver.
---
It gets worse again real fast don't worry.
---
The centaurs in the north central area are really good for farming silk, I got a buttload when I was grinding there. Also its ine if the spots with the 3 chest spawns and nobody seems to ever grab them, I managed to open about a dozen chests while there. 
---
The centaurs mostly drop raw gold and cloth. Some wool, but the good majority is silk. Perfect for the gap in Tailoring, when you are past wool on it but not to silk in first aid...
---
$2O u were in a glitch spot or camping inn consistently (no guards). That’s considered griefing and is a bannable offense
---
Her information is outdated but that was the case for WoW’s first year or so. SW got an AH later and then it even moved a bit closer to the bank after that (its current location in retail wow).

You sound bitter, might want to leave your house and get some fresh air.
---
I’ve been really caught off guard by how few people actually fight me in stranglethorn vale in classic. 19 out of 20 alliance just walk right by.
---
Please do not flirt with Bonk
---
As far as I am aware I'm not leaving anything out. I gank players in the areas with no guards. If a guard aggros me, I either vanish, or sprint and run out into the ocean. I respect the skeptical mindset, though.
---
Well.... actually played classic. Lol. I remember when WoW launched. I thought it was a Warcraft sequel and because it wasn't true to Warcraft, it was trash. Also, that it would never succeed. So, yeah.....bring on the downvotes.
---
Lance reroll
---
Very nice
---
What a nostalgic moment.
---
You can do Graveyard at level 29, but it's a dungeon so you won't get all of the cloth
---
Instead of no flying mounts I’d prefer them to have a long CD and limited time while flying. Something of the effect like your mounts wings getting tired
---
Is there a big difference between a pet with 1.0 and 1.2 attack speed (for PvE)? I have one of the feral mountain lions from Hillsbrad and it has a 1.2 attack speed. Not sure if it would be worth it to spend hours camping for Broken Tooth.
---
I went around with the Gnomish Shrink Ray, that thing was a blast. It will either shrink the enemy reducing the damage they dealt, or made them grow. The back fires were just as comical cause it could affect the entire group depending on how close they are to you.
---
And your knees?
---
Ya, old perceptions die hard, before 1.8 we already had mc/ony/zg, and the raids post 1.8 were aq and naxx, most guilds that raided aq and naxx were most likely already set and invested in their tank roster and their druids were fully set in their healing role, this left a very small subset of the druid community that were both willing to basically start over in terms of gearing (think of how many didn't have access to mark of tyranny because it'd be such a troll pick pre 1.8) AND be in a guild willing to let them experiement
---
You thought people were just walking around 1 shotting things?
---
Just go Soul Link and make people *really* hate you. At least in duels.
---
dont give them any ideas :p lol
---
Make one saying "Me as a tank saying lfg on world"
---
Thank me later.
---
I suppose it's the same reason high level characters camp my corpse for an hour.
---
And shield and vampiric.
---
Interesting theory, let me just message the GMs- oh wait.
---
To clarify I meant the centaurs in Thousand Needles, I forgot to mention because it was the zone you mentioned.
---
That's pretty cool. I lost the EoD to a shadow priest.
---
i figured i would die lmao but actually one of the alliance /cry on my corpse lmao ..it was fun though
---
Meh. Classic wow have so little content that it has to be slowed down: low droprates, huge distances, absence of fly mounts and slow regen do it well. Everything else is just pure nostalgy.
---
Tremor totem is hilariously unreliable if you ever actually rely on it to win, you're in for a rough ride.
---
Must be nice
---
Not something exclusive to WoW. You're going to be judged quickly and lumped in with some group you're apparently a part of. Which is of course defined by the negative traits of that imagined group.
---
You ever seen a troll?
---
You can be killed, if you die before it phases to the next side of the map you get respawned on the boat but not sure what the go is if you die once its phased
---
I gotchu bb
---
Rather wear grey LVL pants instead of those tbh
---
The only profession I had was mining. And yes, I was a rogue. A poor one!
---
I think you might be unable to keep up.  Blocked and bye
---
Gonna need a source on that. Cause 3 51s can absolutely kill a fresh or even semi geared 60. 
---
So you’re saying blizzard has made it verboten to defend yourself.
---
Laughs in warlock
---
They chose the wrong faction
---
Uh, nothing wrong with rogue at all, and they can put out more focus target DPS at lower level without taking agro than mages.
---
I wouldn't want more than 1 for a dungeon probably, taking more utility DPS for remaining slots, but I'd never begrudge 1 in party.
---
It's a typical NPC dialogue from when guards got aggro.
---
Umm... am i the only one seeing the blackout jitter?
---
Is this EU only?
---
Dual spec for me.
---
You mean you got agro because the tank died?
---
I was so disappointed when they made the dungeons easier.
---
Layering
---
Not sure why there would be any difference. It's a PvP server. To quote Blizzard, "PvP problems have PvP solutions".
---
Depends on server pop. 
---
If I went around freely ganking low level Horde, there would be a search party for me after 1 kill
---
Laughs in S Preist
---
Only because the trustee's jail job is farming gold online.
---
Warriors will forever be Gods but you'll see Mages/Lock/Rogue battle for 2nd regularly with each phase. Patchwerk will be the true test in like a year.
---
Where can I find this story
---
If it's in 2 years they need to start developing it before the 2 year mark.
---
Even if you don't like what has happened to osrs it hit peak players in the games history this year. 
---
It doesn't need to be "fan fiction" just another timeline.
---
It's Tuk, not Elv. Same developer but huge difference under the hood.
---
Tuk is much much lighter and harder to break.
---
I hope you’re trolling
---
Well I got it at 34, I guess it loses it's godly powers by then.
---
So correct me if im wrong, but Heart of the wild usually comes at around level 40 due to needing Furor from the resto tree.
---
Lets compare the level 30 wep to the level 40 wep:
---
+13 to both stats translates to +26AP for the STR and +13AP for the Agil that's 39AP pure from stats, with 0.65% bonuses to crit. Feel free to correct me if this is wrong.
---
34AP pure from the hammer +3STR (+6AP) = 40AP and ontop of that a nice 6stamina, which is helpful due to being squishy in cat form.
---
I would argue the hammer is on par/better than those raw stats as a level 30 wep vs a level 40. The question is, what's the next big weapon beyond level 40 that clearly out-performs it?
---
Wall of text incoming

Locks are hard but the trick is either bursting hard with dagger and luck, or kicking/blind the succubus before you're charmed (or have trinket+wotf), or use shadow reflector or vanish to catch coil, or use restorative potion to remove dots. Voidwalker is easier to fight as long as you don't let them cast their .5s second pet.
---
The real danger is not coil out of kidney; it's succubus, or when they dot you up while having defensive cooldowns.

Shamans - stun lock them, don't get stun resisted, and before your KS ends run and hit poison cleansing totem, blind, and reset the fight for another stunlock into death. Sprint in if magma totem is there. In a pinch, poison cleanse only ticks every 5 seconds, so you could get lucky on a blind and have time to run over and kill it.
---
That's not Elv, that's 100% Tuk. Big difference. 
---
Tuk is Ace1/2 engine, Elv is Ace3 and bloated to hell.
---
Kill the enemy before they fear you. Then they will truly fear you.
---
It's Tuk... Jesus people that's not Elv.
---
Same developer but different engines entirely.
---
World PVP began to die as soon as they buffed city guards to be able to root and 3 shot you, which I believe was in Cata
---
You try too hard with your trolling =(
---
Because he was right lol. Also, consumables (scrolls/potions) will speed things up but really aren't required for dungeons while leveling
---
Journey before Destination, my brothers.
---
Not necessarily, you can hire the botnet. To fit the analogy, you could hire 1000 people to park their cars at Disneyland.
---
if theres any truth to your story OP Im gonna be permabanned in no time.  Ive aggressively griefed kids throughout all of wow and never been so much as temp banned and I sure as fuck won't stop now if blizzard wants to impose arbitrary limitations on pvping on a pvp server.  I'll just get banned and never touch another blizzard product again Im super petty and their games aren't that good.
---
Hitting alt f4 when I die and hopping on borderlands instead (ps4, fuck you epic launcher)
---
That doesn’t reflect though...?
---
The farms in Arathi Highlands are a good place the Horde only bad Alliance only ones can be ApE farmed if you are a mage.
---
Mean I dont have to take the one from my house, or the one off my person.
---
Guild Bank is the only thing i would have liked to see. Yes i know its not vanilla - but having a bank for gear, a bank for leather, one for cloth, one for raid mats - etc.... it gets old.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemrack-classic
---
Not outfitter. But go try this and let me know how it works
---
Just will of the forsaken it, easy
---
It’s still funny to chase down low levels and buff them tho.
---
1.5
---
Yeah. LOIC.
---
So they all elect fucked up idiots who represent the worst of their respective societies?
---
Look for swords.  Daggers make tougher leveling.  You can also probably find a decent green quality sword for cheap.
---
2000 iq
---
Shadow priest is the most annoying you can actually fucking cancel the warlocks fear. but this one is fucking instant cast or some shit its so annoying
---
You would need to play pretty rarely; you can have 1.5 levels saved up maximum.
---
 That may have been what I was thinking of.
---
Wtf is wrong with people? I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
They've stated microtransactions go against classic design philosophy.
---
Be a dwarf priest. Fearward ftw.
---
My gut says it was an auto ban. I’ve never ever seen PVP of any kind get someone banned. Unless you were doing something sketchy. 
---
I’d be really interested in seeing what the response to your appeal is.
---
#vanilla #loveit #wysiwyg &lt;3
---
Anyone gotta link to his Twitter, I wanna talk shit.
---
high stonks
---
I'm pretty sure bite ends up out damaging claw regardless, at least the Hunter discord thinks so.
---
Cruel Barb will last until 39? I'm guessing that is a typo.
---
Yea I've never played as a healer but I'm leveling in shadow spec and its dirty man the only counter is dwarf priest racial fear ward, if some one knows of somthing else lmk
---
im not undead im night elf
---
Cruel barb will NOT last you til 39 lol. I think he meant to say 29. Even using it to 29 is pushing it.
---
Kek
---
Na I mean as a brand new player, I myself ran 2 subs for vanilla - Cata but I've never seen anyone join and instantly be like "right I need 2 accounts" lol.
---
Dont thank me, get got
---
Could you tell me which add-on puts the time you've spent on a level on the screen?
---
Naw he's behind bars.
---
Hey paladins are great if uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh you need holy damage and all your priests caught leprosy
---
yeah seeing 100% of people run around with lions when there are a ton more \*cooler\* mobs is kinda lame.
---
He didn't put Stanley down. I did
---
Per John stats book, a dev put it in to piss off sam. They were building the world n shit at points before textures got there and such, the thought was if his face was all over the place—like stamped all over the walls—he’d move faster to get content in the game. 
---
It also clearly highlighted what wasn’t finished.
---
No love for that wonderful Polish driver extraordinaire in Robert Kubica?
---
Okay, could I just get by with quest or dropped swords?
---
if you get cruel barb, you are good to go. else dont waste  time farming. just quest and use whatever you have. lv 28 + go gnome run. one of the boss drops a sword or the mobs drop a mace which is good for leveling. green sword/mace will outdmg the cruel barb
---
My hunter had this in vanilla but I was 13 in 2005 so that's my excuse. Also IIRC I solo'd ZF at 58 to get one of them but I'm not 100% on that
---
True, but they were also all the hardcore players, pug or not. Hitting 60 and mc ready week 2
---
I bet the cowards came in the back door too!
---
Okay cool, thanks!
---
People will wonder later down the line why raid comps are full of mages and no other classes. and cry when only 1 piece of mage gear drops in the whole of MC
---
Reason #4, something to play while your main is getting griefed by a level 60.  Let the dust settle.

&gt; To prevent Ulbricht from encrypting or deleting files on the laptop he was using to run the site as he was arrested, two agents pretended to be quarreling lovers. When they had sufficiently distracted him,[28] according to Joshuah Bearman of Wired, a third agent grabbed the laptop while Ulbricht was distracted by the apparent lovers' fight and handed it to agent Thomas Kiernan.

I was about to do this quest, had to AFK for a few minutes for IRL things, and came back to a hard lesson facilitated by Ilovepoopy...
---
I'll post an update whenever I get a response. I'm leaning towards auto-ban too, though.
---
Meh. Maybe I leveled out of it and ignored it. I haven't seen a single one post of, but even the zf groups I see are taking anybody now days. The saturation of players in the level bracket are far less so it would take much longer to find that specific comp.
---
 You get no hit chance from it and half of the set bonuses are resistances and armor.
---
You can start going to Gnomergan, though the later enemies will be quite tough.
---
Stockades aren't terrible for you, but at this point you'll be finding better items as you progress.
---
In terms of leveling, check out Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, Wetlands and Duskwood.
---
Where is this
---
Just because the tools are available doesn't make it easy. You still have to know how to use those tools and interpret the data. There's no cheat sheet for doing that. If you think it's so easy go try to pass the OSCP.
---
Alright if that will last awhile I'll take it! Thanks!
---
I'm sure there are some decent articles around but for my money you should read "American Kingpin". Really good book
---

Nah. It got banned//suspended
---
Eels bought my mount. Stack of 20g can go on AH for anywhere between 5-10g
---
Are these good because the +weapon skills act as enough to hit to be worth it?
---
i still have 2 days /played (and lvl30) :D was playing much more on private servers Oo
---
Everyone saying engineering but not the other one, enchanting. Allows you to create a trinket with armor, which is great when you need to pop into bear form, which happens often.
---
Pretty much a better version of the utilities most other classes have.
---
I had it in my head that cheap travel forms would somehow make up for lost time, but casually walking between packs and letting Spirit do its job may be the better way to go and save on the talents.  I think you're onto something.
---
The primary worry is OoC doesn't proc often enough, but I should try it before assuming I suppose.  I'm surprised by how much damage my staff is actually doing.
---
Going to give whacking a chance!
---
Picking locks is part of a rogues kit that they bring to the group. Should mages charge for their water? Should a priest charge for their stam buff? Quit being a greedy prick.
---
Triforce of Courage
---
thank the light
---
pardon me, what is a twink item? the item that let you use ability?
---
Other then being undead and having a pocket priest what ways?
---
I die a lot more as a hunter than as a warrior.
---
While I leveled my warrior, I carefully planned the pulls, and if the mob was a though one, I would try to have a path to flee.
---
As a hunter? I don't care about anything, I send my pet against 4 mobs, because I should be able to kill that. I'm so relaxed as a hunter that I make so many mistakes, overpull, etc, and die a lot because of that.
---
But at least I was able to kill morladim at level 20, and kite stitches to stormwind at lvl 23 (but the guards killed it at the gate)
---
I respect the skepticism, but as I said above, as far as I'm aware I'm not leaving anything out.
---
*sigh*...*unzips*
---
This. I complain about my warrior all the time but I wouldn't trade him for any other class.
---
It would help if we knew exactly what it is you’re trying to parody because I got no fucking clue.
---
There also wayyyy more human players than night elf players.
---
I was looking at BIS for Feral Tank druid, and came across this guide which a lot of people recommend.

A few millions in fines, assuming he cannot pay them. I assume he is then bankrupt, and his financial prosperity is ruined forever?
---
Is that runescape or wow? can't tell with those graphics
---
Lok'tar ogar! For the Horde!
---
As someone that has spent years playing both factions I can say that the opposite is also true
---
Guards can’t reach you up there.  You can attack alliance without risk of guard-death which is considered an exploit.
---
Well then... I'll die fighting. But man I'm trying. Lol.

I’ve only gotten my golds worth out of tremor form in WC. Since then, I’ve always outranked my totem before it ticks. I tested it in Ungoro on those pterodactyls that randomly cast an instant fear, it didn’t work a single time out of the 15 mobs I killed for the quest, all the while leveling my weapon skill from 1.
---
Il give it a try thanks.
---
We horde go jellyfish hunting and squeeze them of their life-giving jelly. Tastes great spread on [Mulgore Spice Bread].

And he gon be livin on ez street in prison via clapped cheeks and dick sucks for x amount of years all because he DDOSed WoW
---
Yes. live in South Alabama. It's quite common here.
---
All I did is say it wasn't DEFINITELY him. Here in America we believe in innocent until proven guilty so it's unfair to state with certainty that it was him. I DIDN'T say it PROBABLY WASN'T him. Merely contested the claim of the person who said "YES IT WAS" him. I'm sorry if my tempered response was alarming, that was not its intent.
---
Lok'Tar!

Stare at his face. Really look at it. His expression turns from shame to utter depression.

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-macros-classic-wow
---
That was hard
---
Cranky retail GMs being forced to answer classic tickets obviously....
---
Im pretty sure they only had two season planned out from the get go. From the start until the end with the cabal. That might be 3 seasons I forget. But either way the cabal was clearly the big bad and they had no idea how big the show would get and the demand to keep it around. So once they dropped the original big bad they might have needed a season or two of "winging it" to write a solid story going forward.
---
When did they give the guards guns? I swore that was during vanilla.
---
Sure.  But I wasn't doing that.
---
Top of gadget arena is a ban

W0t..... is that guy drunk or something?
---
It’s insane people think priests 30sec cooldown fear is OP.  Pretty much everyone has a way to break it and then you’ve got no CC at all.
---
I have a shaman guild and let me tell you we aren’t the most popular class.
---
I think the chests should be rolled by everyone who can open it. Both rogues and blacksmiths have that ability.
---
You already have people sharing nodes between miners (only), so people should be sharing chests between people who can unlock it
---
I think you got it wrong. Paladins, monks and death knights.
---
Probably gonna tell them all he's a mastermind hacker.
---
Why the NSFW tag? Nurses and shit deal with this everyday

Edited to add source
---
Not if it were me.  I love pvp and fight anyone I can, but I wait for them to finish the mob and heal up, bc I want a fair fight.  -orc warrior
---
That is actually why I rerolled from a Shaman (was level 12) to a Paladin. I missed being able to buff everyone by just running into them.
---
Yeah I left out blacksmiths sent aware they could too
---
Zandalar Tribe EU!

Go to your macro menu and make that macro then put it on an actionbar. 
---
Go to your key binds menu and add a key binds for that individual action bar so your mouse triggers it.
---
He was caught with a gram of weed.
---
How are enemy allies on a pvp realm somehow adding my battlenet?
---
If you look for a rogue specifically for lockpicking, then sure, roll for it.
---
If you look for "any dps" and get a rogue, then the rogue should choose what to do.
---
Thats why you look specifically for a rogue for the stockades
---
Yeah except the horde is actually decidedly evil
---
Why? To inconvenience the other player. To have them make a hopefully long corpse run. To delay them reaching their goals by even a few minutes. 
---
I feel a sense of accomplishment every time I kill a member of the opposing faction. Knowing that they’re disheartened even a little. Knowing they’re slightly inconvenienced, knowing that I imparted some feeling other than joy upon my enemy. 
---
It’s all gravy, my dude.
---
If you're only focused on the cosmetic sure. I don't think you realize how annoying this pet is to casters. Constant interruptions when trying to cast and this lion is slapping the shit out of you and your cc is on cooldown.
---
It’s like the end of A Bug’s Life when they realized they were stronger in numbers.
---
We are all products of the system. If I get ganked by a shaman then I'm killing the next shaman I see. I don't care if the names aren't the same or the levels are different, in my mind I'm getting my vengeance.
---
It's probably an attempt to "nip it in the bud." Lots of players used that specific spot. Hundreds of forum meltdowns. Over-reporting for sure. But, safer to avoid this specific one.
---
That gave me a chuckle when I finally got it, thank YOU
---
Worth the time to make 2 bank characters and fill up every spot with them :)
---
Thats how they got him???
---
Paladin is pretty low i imagine!
---
dont think so cuz i recorded fine on fraps with this exact computer, must be tweaking. If you figure it out let me know and i'll do the same.
---
I was joking but obvs taken badly; no sweat
---
Okay but you're on a pvp server. Anyone and their mom could just claim they weren't attacking anyone (not calling you a liar, btw) but for the sake of consistency maybe in the GMs perspective it's best to keep everyone off the roof
---
How difficult is this staff to obtain? This is my first time playing wow.
---
In order to space things out they need two new lines between them, what you edited doesn't seem to have helped
---
Let me /flirt while running
---
I would add a group finder function.
---
Not the automated queue system, and not even a cross-realm party finder like in retail. Just a group search/flag window to help make finding parties to join less obnoxious than spamming chat channels (I hated that method even back when WoW was new and we didn't have a better in-game method in its competitors either).
---
“Ruining your entire life”
---

Could you tell me which auction add-on you use? Still looking for one
---
Lol, I was here earlier today. They won't let Undead fly either.
---
After you make your Smoking Heart, drop Enchanting and get Blacksmithing for Glimmering Mithril Insignia to better deal with your counter classes.

---
According to;  https://vanillaradar.com/elysium-stats/ are druids and warlocks the less favourite classes. But as you also can see there  shaman isnt favourite either. This is ofcourse mostly due to race limitation since shaman can only be played as an tauren. Just like paladin can only played as human.  But still if you would multiply it by 2 they're still on of the least favourite classes.
---
My choise would go to druids if you want to make a new character. They are one of the worst classes in classic (looking at raiding). Only resto is good the other specs are not that great especially tanking because you can only dodge. How ever, druids have some good spells which are useful like rebirth , innervate and Mark of the wild. They're also great in PvP because of the movement speed and self healing. 
---
At the moment I'm also levelling a druid and I really enjoy it so far :)
---
Yeah, of course.  I can understand that's the intent, but the explanation was lacking.  To say the least.
---
Plus he said he regularly does it for shorter periods of time. I haven't read the disruptive behavior part of the EULA but i'd be checking there to see what it says
---
Yeah but that sucks. I've been questing and doing normal non-aoe dungeon runs and having a lot of fun even though it's not as efficient.
---
Game mechanics
---
When I'm ready to join a guild, I'll go out and find one. (Or perhaps make one.) I don't need them whispering me. Almost as bad as the credit card offers in the mail. I just dont reply and if they send an invite along with it, they get /ignored too.
---
Now that’s thinking!

---
Alternatively, a version of the Transmog system, but I figure the top one would be easier.

I'd rather gi to guantanamo bay then, thanks.
---
Its ridiculous, I've ran RFK, Arms, Lib and Cath several times this week and not once did I get an actual blue upgrade. Everything I could've rolled on, I greeded because they were upgrades for me, but we're better for other players. Yet, apparently all we do is ninja? I don't understand why other Hunters roll on items with no stats. Sure, Chance on hit or equip stats are nice but I need that Agi man. Honestly, we're not all that bad.
---
You fight that dwarf in The Missing Diplomat questline and two red NPCs assist him. They must’ve attacked me and ilovepoopy died so I wasn’t saved while AFK.
---
You dont need shadow damage gear
---
The cost of respec. Way too steep. I love talent trees but I want to be able to experience various builds and test them out. I can’t see any benefits in putting such a high price for it. Makes 0sense to me. 
---
Other features I’d like:
---
- The hairdresser. I realised I change my character look more often than I think. 
---
- Tmog. It doesn’t affect gameplay and pushes to go get that sweet loot to look our best. 
---
- Guild bank too. Again no impact on gameplay so why not. But I wish I could share some loot with my Guildies. Especially for low level recruits.
---
And this is why as a warrior tank I don't invite hunters to instances. They will roll on slow 2handers bc "sometimes I melee!!" Ok well sometimes I don't need the stress and you get to sit out
---
Thats called an assumption. Everyone just is assuming hes some idiot edgelord. Dont get me wrong at a minimum he is an edge lord. But the public has no idea at this point. Im not saying your wrong. But no one knows any real details.
---
Warriors have multiple ways to break fear.  Half the PVP trinkets break it when they show up.  Blacks nothing trinket breaks it I think.  Pallets can bubble or cleanse it off others.  Mages can ice block it.  Hunter pets beast within breaks it.  Tremor totem breaks it.  Grounding totem can absorb warlock fear.
---

It goes Warrior &gt; Mage &gt; Rogue &gt; Shaman &gt; Hunter &gt; Priest &gt; Warlock &gt; Druid on my server. Although at 60 the number of Mages usually out number Warriors.
---
No, I'm saying doing it over and over so noone can do anything is a dick move and a textbook example of "disruptive".
---
“Any less weird or tragic” yea because no other country has an issue with stabbings or violent crime.

---
Allowing ungrouped people to kill the same quest mobs for credit. That's my favorite qol change in retail, and I miss it in vanilla.
---
Actually any curse would do. This because you can only have 1 curse active on any one target. So CoR gets replaced by CoA.

That’s why you need to play undead!

3. Resurrect on top of the flight master, because you are definitely close enough.

4. Play somewhere else if you can't figure any of those out.

Your argument is basically saying that all PvP is essentially disruptive.

Hey! Not sure exactly how to write this macro but I do have some resources for you:
---
1) Here is the wowhead link for their general macro-creation guide. It should give you a good place to start on how to think about making them. https://www.wowhead.com/making-a-macro-commands-modifiers-warcraft-guide
---
2) Look up the Classic Warrior Discord. There may already be pre-made macros for you there and there will certainly be someone knowledgeable who can help you.
---
3) As far as keybinds go, macros function just like abilities. If you type /macro in-game, it will bring up the macro menu. From there you can create and save a macro, then drag it to your action bar and use it just like you would an ability. You can change the keybinds for any position on any action bar from the "keybinds" section on the menu when you press the escape key.

Hope this helps!

In that case, I appologize. I've been playing since TBC and that's the first I've ever heard of any area's of booty bay being guard free.

That's an overkill.  As a healer, you're MC ready once you're in your high 50s and have under 1k ms.
---
Isn’t this the dungeon layering exploit that Blizzard is about to banhammer on?
---
Sounds right.  Dots rarely break it, but immolate's upfront damage or sbolt will frequently break it right away.
---
its more effective to farm these one by one, partly because of a10 yard range attack these guys have, but also because there spawns are heavily contested.
---
He guy said he liked making asmongold mad on his Twitter.

If you want to play a druid, just play one.
---
It's not gonna matter unless you join a server first guild. What's the point of playing the game if you're not allowed to play the class you want?
---
I just switched from a Mage to Druid and I'm loving every moment of it!
---
I'm not into that because of how often I forget to switch into my normal gear lol.  And Itemrack seems bugged right now, I can't keybind item sets like I normally would. Plus spurs are like 50 silver, I don't mind reapplying them to my 2nd best pair of boots.
---
Sounds like my trip to India

You spend all this time writing out an argument and then agree with me in your last paragraph. Why shouldn’t rogues need on lockboxes since they’re the only ones that can open them? Clearly you understand the holes in your logic, right?
---
You know about downranking and all that jazz? 400 healing is good.

Is there an add-on for translating what the opps say?
---
Isn’t this the dungeon layering exploit that gets you around the instance lockout and resets instances? Blizzard is about to do mass bans on this.

They probably thought they were super smart and that they would end up getting a job in the FBI like the movies... Again they are a dumb ass

Don't listen to these guys. These are the type that will require you to have T2 gear to raid T1.

A lot of shamans drop out in the 30-50 range.
---
Enhancement shaman, the big news a lot of shaman players seem to be interested in, starts to feel like garbage in the 40+ range. Shamans who are interested in DPS roles/not keeping healing gear around means they can't heal dungeons anymore and DPS looking for dungeon sucks.
---
But if you're really on about being unique, and like something that's actually shaman-ish, go druid. They're always the least played class and like shaman their best spec is a healing one.
---
Same here. Especially when they're multiboxing.
---
“Notice me senpai” is already pathological. Japan is weird.
---
Locked boxes != Locked chests. Clearly you have bad reading comprehension.

Please.  If this was my server there would be 15 alliance lvl 60 in a raid group, and he wouldn't have even had a chance to pull the elite.

Holy shit. Please post this on r/classicwowscreenshots if you have a moment. I'm breaking my once per day rule to invite you there. This is the best I've seen so far.
---
Just a clip. Same happened to me at Theramore and Redridge tower. It is honestly whatever.
---
I remember a horde macro back in the day that was tied to bloodlust activation. The shaman would /yell  "Feel the Rhythm! Feel the Rhyme! Get on up, it's bloodlust time!"  I tried to do an alliance heroism version but just wasn't the same.
---
I want to see his face.
---
Don't think so, its rare. I'm 41 currently and had an easy time so far by getting a new sword every 3-5 levels on the auction house. Random green swords are not that expensive and the dps boost helps a lot. And due to skinning I still made just enough to afford a mount right as I hit 40.

You can have the friend reset it as well but using your own alt allows you to be able to reset instances by yourself

That’s a weird thing to think about

This is some heavy earrape indeed.
---
I got all 5 pieces of Fang set (and the ring) today in a single dungeon, the 2nd hunter got a bit jealous. In the next dungeon I did to finish quests I got the bow.
---
I'm pretty sure I've spent all my luck from lvl 20 to 60 on that.
---
"it's ok I'm using 7 proxies"
---
Move, change identity. It's possible to get out of even that kind of punishment.
---
An apple doesn’t look or taste like an orange but they’re both fruit. 
---
They’re both “just loot that doesn’t help the group progress the dungeon” that you unlock. You’re being overly reductive because you know you’re wrong and can’t defend your selfish attitude.
---
I understood that reference.
---
Also it made me cringe in pain
---
First offense? Conditional discharge? Bruh, you ever heard of multimillion dollar companies getting pissed off at someone and not making their 9000 lawyers throwing the book at them? This poor retard literally just threw away his entire life.
---
I've heard they no longer recruit hackers to work cyber security. They couldn't stop hacking shit despite landing a job.
---
So move. If it's that bad, just move. There are countries that give way less of a shit about it.

Well, then, it makes sense you'd be afraid all the time. Good game design.

Just kicked someone from a ZF run today because their guild was full of douchebags the first week. Your memory might not be good, but some people's are.

lmao its stupid
---
That’s stupid fix the environment then.
---
Sad that priests, shamans and paladins can either sit at the healer table or get the hell out. Classic+ is something I look forward to for this reason. The average player is still somewhere around level 30-45 so the numbers will change, but we're probably talking 3-4% max for those classes DPS roles.

What's the mod for making notes on players that I see to remember if they were good/bad/etc? I thought it was HandyNotes... but that seems more for notes on the map...
---
Well, isn't it kind of the point that you're gonna have PVP server players with conflicting opinions on the rules of war? Sherrifs and bandits. Players bound by honour or by their thirst for blood. It's what creates tense and dynamic confrontations on the battlefield, those few seconds determining friend or foe, sizing the other player up and calculating your odds. 
---
PVP is the wild west, and the wild west would be pretty damn boring if we didn't have players from both philosophies to build that need tension.
---
This guy is actually spending his time doing this for us when he could be playing
---
Kicking you out is douchy, no doubt. But saying classic is supposed to be played slow an retail fast is wrong. Classic is by design slower than retail but its stil perfectly fine to go for the most efficient tactics that are aviable.
---
I think it has more to do with interfering with others' game play rather than cleaverly using game mechanics
---
I actually love healing cleaves. Pulling 400 to 500 hps at level 40 in RFD as a HPal. 
---
I love running with 4 warriors. Team plate all the way. The worst are warlocks who life tap to full mana.
---
Ahh okay, my professions right now are engineering and mining idk how much I can make off those because I'm kind of new

RIP headphone users

You've offered no counter arguments. So you're projecting because you're afraid of losing.
---
Locked Chests are a world item node like herbs and ores. Locked boxes are mob drops which get called by the game under a need or greed roll. Even the game disagrees with you.
---
Dude, I still run into the same mage, priest, and rogue that I met the first day in Brill. I recognize names in world chat and a couple of guildies have been ganked by the same druid in almost every contested zone they leveled in.

lots of us worked all week. I worked 50 hours, couldnt play much, made plans to not have the wife or kid friday and was really looking forward to playing WoW all night.

when I couldn't play I was very disappointed and wished lots of ill will towards this individual. glad to see justice will be served.
---
This clip is an accurate depiction of what PvP looks like after AQ40 and Naxx gear enters the scene.
---
Dude, yes. I’m so sick of looking for the tank and realizing it’s the guy with the Ravager. My cleave groups are NEVER as fast as having an actual tank. And if they even come close I have to push my mana to the limit every single time.
---
A bag of dicks indeed

So fun.  Love it.  Glad it's here.  It's by no means objectively useful, but for immersion and fun, it's great.

I quite like the chests you get from fishing, usually full of crafting mats (including the leather I need to make bags!)

So what was he referring to when he said "did this"?

We must purge the unclean

Yea, horde since WOTLK on PvP and I have had alliance gank me non-stop while leveling on both retail and classic.

I'm a huge fan of this , also being a Tauren war.

There were people ganking from up there before and after this happened to me. So you're spot on.

Why can’t you just stop going up there... is it really that big a deal to give this poor guy a hard time? If the GM was being rude off the rip I could *maybe* understand, but he was extremely polite and even gave you 2 warnings.
---
Probably because there's been an overflow of these posts and the mods decided to not allow individual posts about the subject. If you're curious, I recommend looking up Kargoz' videos on YouTube. Super well-informed and helped me pick a main.
---
Fuck that. I want to see what this kid looks like.
---
It's not "exploration" when you're quite literally exploiting the geometry to gank people without the guards attacking you lol
---
I think they're trying to police the fact that you can avoid being hit by guards there. Seems pretty bullshit to me as well, but I suppose if you imagine how bad it can get if left unchecked, it's probably fair.
---
Here, take a downvote.
---
Locks have death coil which is instant fear, high damage and a heal to the caster then a follow up with the normal fear or the aoe howl of terror, a lock is much more cancerous to fight against then any shadow priest

Spit...? Or swallow?

This is terrible! I'm so sorry

This is hilarious given your snide remark to the op of this comment chain..

We're far more technologically advanced, yet leveling as horde is much easier.

I find it a bit hard to believe that it costs "a few million" to pay some sysadmins' and investigators' salaries. And in any case, the debt is effectively (on a moral level) being "paid off" by his time in prison.

---
So there I was, doing a 2 AM SM Cathedral runs, not very many people on and trying to get groups together is hard. Get a message from some guy whose name I instantly recognized from a week prior on LFG where everyone attests to his constant ninja'ing, racism, and general BMs. Told him he can find another group and after about three clears of the dungeon I eventually got together I finally see him stop posting in LFG. Maybe he found a party, maybe he didn't, but it definitely took him longer than it would have because.... Server reputation matters. I come across people I've met before countless times. And believe me when I say there are definitely certain people I don't like and try not to group with.
---
Let the old people have their fun
---
A script kiddies wet dream.
---
Most classes compete for gear. You sound a bit harsh to be honest by saying: "He refuses to change." Get fucking over yourself. If you cannot group with another Paladin, that's your problem. He already said it will be fine.
---
Fear is more likely to break when hit with with alot of damage at once like a fireball, shadowbolt, etc. When taking little bits of damage at a time like having multiple dots on you, it's way less likely to break which is why it's so dangerous when used by a warlock.
---
You need to understand that this is Activision Blizzard.  They're designing games to make money rather than designing games for their community.  If all goes well with classic the next bag of money is BC.  The content doesnt require development time.  Dont get me wrong future classic content would be nice, but I dont think that this current leadership could pull it off.
---
You mean he found it out on wikipedia and then was too dumb to switch the site.
---
Erm. Why is your character menu button the face of a balding, facial haired human male?
---
I'm over it even for SM. mages get priority over other dps.
---
And thus also more guilds struggling with easy mc bosses as they try to drag a bunch of wet noodle "can't tell me to play no meta" players through to keep their roster alive.
---
This is a classic, "Being punished for someone else's actions"
---
Other people got on top of the buildings, and starting attacking, griefing other players while being completely safe from the Guards.  It's exploiting game terrain, exactly as the GM said.
---
Because other people did it, it is now a bannable offense.  REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS WERE, you are not allowed on top of buildings in Gadgetzan. Take it as a life lesson.  This won't be the last time you suffer from someone else's actions.  Better get used to it!
---
The best thing about the death-ray is that it's possible for a lvl 40 to kill a lvl 60 with it.  Rare, but sweet deliciousness as the lvl 60 stares at his corpse and wonders wtf just happened.
---
Unlikely. If you're ddosing huge servers like blizzard you're going to need a rather large bot net and my guess is the people who lease time on those bots aren't just advertising all over Google

Gadgetzon was completely closed off to Alliance yesterday. The arena roof exploit combined with [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d650u0/gadgetzon_rogue_ganking_on_the_ground_alliance/) are pretty excessive since the aggrieved party cannot fight back. That, and the popularity of these exploits at a level I've never seen before, make me very glad they're going to do something. It has gone beyond a fun little quirk (that I've participated in and enjoyed) into sustained greifing.
---
thanks!
---
I always ask people to at least look at the loot inside the chest before rolling. Too often do items drop that someone claims they need anyways, so the item will most likely be given to them. I find it kind of silly to roll on chests without even knowing what's inside.
---
I'm astonished and trying to pinpoint this.  This page doesn't give a definitive answer:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.9.0
---
When an item or equipment says "Boosts x damage by up to x" is it actually a random amount up to the number? Since it specifically says "up to" and not just "Boosts damage by 25"
---
Tbf humans have tanks and helicopters, so it is more of a steampunk with magic kinda game.
---
You mean AlphaBay?
---
Guilds are popping up left and right like &lt;Where is Mankriks Wife&gt; and &lt;I PVPd Mankriks wife&gt;
---
If it is bannable, it isn't intended. If it isn't intended, fix it. 
---
Easy.
---
You right. It's not a big deal. 
---
But, I got warned about attacking people via an exploit, and then a 'final warning' for trying to jump up some boxes. It was just a strange interaction. One that has ruffled some feathers for posting about...
---
Bro what!
---
No one considers the possibility this wasn't the only thing that happened between them and OP tries to paint himself in a favorable light? 
---
No?

Alright.
---
To me personally there are two types of races I enjoy in Fantasy.
---
Really weird, interesting races or very physically appealing races. So I actually love almost every Horde race (went alliance because my friends were), and I enjoy things like elves. But gnomes and dwarves are just, short people. Like there's nothing else there to me. In some way fantasy games you get to live out a fantasy, so I'd rather either be physically intimidating, physically attractive, or something totally different. Not just really really short.
---
However, in fantasy literature I'm totally fine with the races and honestly love a lot of lore around dwarves. Just when choosing races I'm going to play as I don't enjoy them.
---
mages regen is based on spirit too, how exactly do you think evocation works?
---
Needs some magnifying goggles for the chat box.
---
there is no way to defend the guy, they even called his bullshit and offered him water which was turned down, the guy is a scrub.

You need about three blessings...might/wisdom, salv, Kings. Totems are pretty much windfury for a couple melee teams and maybe a mana tide for a healer group.
---
Because pewdiepie is annoying too.

Meh to each his own. I'd much rather look good then be in a hodge podge of gear. Plus I liked looking up cool gear to transmog

Someone linked a very funny AoE Frost Mage levelling guide the other day and now I can't find it for the life of me. It was fairly old but was very funny and had a wicked soundtrack. Second song in the video was Brian Eno - Help Me Somebody. Can somebody help me? Haha
---
Giving out fort becomes a PITA at high levels, shit costs a third of your mana bar. Not saying that warrants this behavior, but I usually only keep it up on the tank or I’ll have to drink for 2 minutes and be left far, far behind.
---
Horde are literally savages though. Most of them live in huts, and one of the races is into cannablism.
---
gnomish build all the bop then switch to goblin
---
Nope. I run on Faerlina, which at this point remains one of the few realms with a lengthy queue each day, and I still see the same D-bags.
---
I even see the same horde players here and there questing in the same areas as we level up (not jerks, just highlighting that you see many of the same folks routinely, even cross faction). 
---
The real turds seem to thrive in instances where they try to “reserve” certain items, even in low level instances, and exclude other players/classes that could possibly roll on anything they like.  The other night I had a shadow priest in my group that refused to buy water because it was too expensive so spent all of ZF wanding, slowing down the run, and then tried whispering the party lead to boot the warlock so he could get the voodoo mask if it dropped.  He also wasn’t spec into spirit tap, which was mind blowing. I’ll never forget.
---
Nahh if you have the same mobs as I do, war is on.
---
Could be super strong elves with facial hair who don’t do arcane magic, gnomes who are brilliant engineers, or dwarves who are great miners, archeologists and hunters. Nah let’s pretend to be Sir Lancelot
---
Yeah, but dorf females are thiccc
---
Not everyone can afford to buy / wants to buy full stacks of items :)

Thats why you wont get anywere lol dont hate

I don't know if it's just because I'm a nice guy, or that I've always at least had a hunter alt......But when I see a hunter trying for a rare pet, I just let them have it. We can have our PVP fun *after* they get their tame.
---
Ohhh this already exists, it is called a PvE realm.
---
Can confirm. Kill nearly every alliance I cross paths with.
---
How did I miss that post? That's awesome!
---
Idk why so many downvotes.  53 feral here.  High int is good for Druid period.  As shape shifting is only base mana and power shifting when low energy is useful to reveal, tag, redshift and keep going.  It shouldn’t be your main stat but I keep at least +20 int leveling to allow for an extra shift or two
---
Alliance players are Obama voters
---
So you're saying people aren't stupid, they're pretending to be stupid?

...

Right.
---
Uh I let ret pallys raid so no I'm not that type. I'm the type that wants new players to know they need more then 1 just stat to be MC ready. +Healing is great but if you have 1.5k hp and go OOM after 30 seconds your not MC ready...
---
That difficulty was fine if you were going in with a premade but unreasonable to expect 5 randoms from group finder to do in a timely manner. The mythic system they introduced in wod was the right way to do it in a post group finder world.

Forcing millions of players to not be able to play a hyped up game on the weekend? Let's say they dont prosecute these assholes. For example... all month a million people are refused service.  That's 15,000,000 worth of damages. It may not seem like much, but that's a lot in potential damages
---
Fat fingered the title. Rage had me typing to fast on my phone. “Tank wanted loot to himself so he kicked me right before the pull”is what it’s supposed to say.
---
Isn’t that the point? 4g isn’t a lot, just like the meme is saying 4 dollars isn’t a lot.
---
1.12 was Blizzard's big mistake. Arcane Explosion used to have a cast time unless talented, seeing it spammed was much more rare. We were cursed with the group killing version.
---
Take a break and come back to it later. Remember, people been playing WoW for 15 years. It’s not going anywhere.
---
I did a few pickpocket runs last night and calculated my average haul.  
---
To be fair, I've never played on private servers and don't know the actual optimal route, but I basically hit every humanoid I could up until angerforges room, the full arena, and the mobs on the other side where pyro is, which took \~7-8 minutes a run.
---
This netted me just under 3g from just copper and silver including lockboxes, and maybe an extra 50s or so from the junk in the lockboxes. At 7 minutes a run, that would be 15G every 35 minutes, but then you'd be locked out. for \~25 minutes after that.
---
from what I gather, the junk from pickpocketing sold for a lot more on private servers, because I really can't see this method being viable for farming purposes.
---
Almost makes me wish i rolled a mage.
---
born 82
---
just saying, if you ask me for food randomly in the wild its nice if you give a tip even just 10s. i dont mind giving it for free and i wont as for it but a small part of me does resent you a little.

Not sure what server you are playing on but horde outnumber the alliance on 95% of pvp servers by a decent amount

You're free to dig up the VoD from his stream on twitch.tv/kevinjordan if you care that much. I don't care enough about your opinion to waste my time digging up something that was said verbally weeks ago.
---
It’s been my experience as an Alliance player in Hillsbrad that we outlevel the horde in the area pretty significantly when we arrive, and it stays that way.  The only real WPVP I experienced in the area was when Timmy Tenders tried to form a raid against everyone and got mega wrecked and camped by alliance for an hour. 
---
TBH though, unless I’m provoked I rarely attack a member of the opposing faction. Fighting over a chicken quest to spawn is an exception.
---
It is and I am pretty sure none of the big cities are like the alliance would describe.
---
not really directly related, but what do you guys use to capture these moments? I'd love to be able to retrospectively save the last minute or so of gameplay quickly and easily.
---
They're literally just fixing it because half the time it doesn't even work and just activates wasting the CD, and the FD + Freezing Trap macros are really buggy and unreliable most of the time.
---
It’s gon b good.
---
... or at least I hope. I’ve been let down by shows already this year, looking at you GoT.
---
Yeah wow that's way over the line obviously... generally it's just a few minutes of poking at people from the inn roof. Anything prolonged, esp. if you use exploits, should clearly be stopped.
---
Hi how’re ya?
---
You get arcane explosion at 14
---
Then this game isn't for you? 
---
Why are you on this sub and complaining? It's an MMORPG, it's slow paced. A big portion of the game is leveling then repetitive grinding for gear. 
---
Maybe this isn't your cup of tea?
---
If the tank is going slow just tell him he can go faster. If he’s still going slow tell him more bluntly. If he still goes slow remember his name as that slow tank and don’t group with him. 
---
Just communicate, if I’m tanking I appreciate when team talks about going too fast or slow so that we hit it right.
---
Nobody is forcing you to play. You play what you feel like to play when you have time to play

At 14+ they do.

I tried to download classic WoW tonight to finally give it a try, but I'm only able to find the retail version. The website says the classic version should be one of the options in the dropdown menu in the Battlenet app, but it's not there. Any advice?
---
As a rogue, I'm looking for a guide to taking warriors. I need to backstab!!
---
Good.
---
Storm wind has plumbing
---
Judging by my friends list this is a you problem. People are playing at their own pace (one buddy is level 18. Some are in the 50s). We are all having fun.
---
We still did it....
---
It does matter, especially when people with already overrepresented classes (Mage, DD Warrior, Rogue) are trying to find a raid.
---
For the first time ever, I'm glad I work graveyard shifts. There's zero queue by the time I get home from work, and the servers feel barren at those hours. I tried playing last Saturday night and spent the first hour running back to my corpse over and over, while also waiting for quest mobs to respawn because they were being camped by loads of other players.
---
I played Wow like twice but from what I can gather I can assume that this sucks ass so fuck that guy and let's hope he dies in a fire
---
It’s great. Pet goes kills things and I just auto and have such little work to do. Love my hunter leveling. Dreading going for warrior next...
---
I do play on pvp servers, Grobbulus on classic and Emerald Dream on retail.
---
Legitimately just threw his life away on something people barely noticed, poor kid.
---
I keep hearing this but I don't get it. Shadowcraft for example, alot of the pieces have either the same, more or barely less agi than the other BiS pieces. But everyone acts like its night and day.
---
Is there really THAT much of a difference?
---
I think hes talking about the assholes that post single stacks at 1 copper bid and ludicrous buyout prices
---
Are there any more details about the dude? Nationality? Age?
---
Lol you asked the wrong community
---
There are 2 different types of friends, Battlenet friends which is your battle net account (basically the same as adding a friend on steam) and character friends which is tied to your wow account. Anyone can add anyone as a friend on battlenet, once inside wow you can only add character friends from your faction.

except for rogues. screw rogues. they were out of control in tbc. even having a shield disarm (maybe this was wotlk) because QQ we can't kill tanks, a class and spec specifically designed to mitigate damage - especially physical.
---
Private server experience says 5g-10g as a price range. I got offered 5g for an Xmute yesterday and was content with that.
---
Other transmutes have no cooldown, do them if you can play the AH for profit.
---
There’s a mage on Yojamba that is online seemingly every hour of the day that spans every chat channel LFM for ZF, he will only take mages as dps. He’s still level 50 with probably 10 days played time because he literally is LFM for hours at a time. 
---
If the idiot went and levelled properly he would be 60 by now.
---
I've seen this before in those cop videos that are on YouTube.

"You are under arrest stop resisting."

"But why?!?  Why am I under arrest?"

"For blah blah blah"

"But why???? Why ?!?! I don't understand?"

"I just explained it to you now stop resisting!"
---
"Nooo, I don't understand, why?!? Why?!?!?!."
---
I've watched too many of these videos.
---
I enchanted everything I could when leveling early on. Every party I was in I asked if anyone needed the enchants I had. You do what you gotta do!
---
clearly a member of a private organization not a public official.
---
Nope, I think he doesn't have auction addon.
---
I think (idk 4 sure tho) that resetting this way still counts towards the 5 resets so they're not avoiding it, they're just avoiding the time spent getting to the start of the dungeon.
---
that's already in the game, why even point that out? You could of picked one of the two zones to the west and to the east of the burning steppes
---
You're wrong. It doesn't matter how high the damage is, but dots have a lower chance to break fear.
---
&gt;Patch 1.11 6/19/06 Fear: The calculations to determine if Fear effects should break due to receiving damage have been changed. The old calculation used the base damage of the ability. The new calculation uses the final amount of damage dealt, after all modifiers. In addition, the chance for a damage over time spell to break Fear is now significantly lower. Note that Fear continues to be roughly three times as likely to break on player targets as on non-player targets. (nerf)
---
(assuming it works like it did in vanilla)
---
I dunno man I’m pretty sure I’m homeless

There is also a potion that gives you 50dmg per second aoe.

For people who are annoyed by this behaviour: Addons like auctionator make navigating the AH much more conveniently. For one it compresses stacks like that into a single listing you can buy from multiple times.

Yeah I'm not really sure what the issue is here...I think everyone agrees the dungeon layering thing was a bug/exploit. I thought the episode was great and I love hearing different opinions.
---
I first thought you meant the chicken was your girlfriend lol
---
Questie recently added a new tracker in an update that does this.
---
It was 5g for me in vanilla on multiple servers
---
Are you comparing getting ganked once to farming dozens of low level players for hours on multiple occurence?
---
Was this on rattlegore by chance I saw something similar in alterac mountains earlier today, rezzed someone then booked it after the spriest targeted me.
---
Lol no I didn't
---
Ok
---
Yeah its making me want to level a mage alt, just not sure what to do for gold at this point
---
Fear is so fucking stupid. Not even my tremor totem stops it.
---
Stay in your circle. Nobody gives a shit about your opinion. Welcome to classic.
---
Social games leave room for people to be dicks. But when you think about it, all the good and kind interactions you had weren't controlled or incentivized by the game either.
---
I feel it makes interactions with other players more genuine.
---
Back in vanilla i sold one for 900g on my server horde druid thunderlord
---
They both look pretty awesome though.
---
I love posts like this. Never stop.
---
Shadowcraft lacks hit doesn't it? I remember back in original on a rogue the goal was to try and reach hit cap for raiding. I don't think they are terrible, but it's not BiS but again you don't need BiS anyway. Some of the other classes sets are worse iirc.
---
I'm still going to go for the sets on my characters, but yeah at times it might be better to swap in different pieces for raiding
---
Ok like I said I'm not familiar with this exploit but I'd personally err on the side of caution seems a similar but a little more exploity then ghetto hearthing.
---
 Someone should try posting screencaps of lfg chat then
---
I have liked Max since I started watching F1 but after he got knocked out of the last race and was totally chill about it in his interview he is definitely my favorite.
---
All my current quests are way too hard for me to complete. Already went up 1 level grinding amd i still cant finish them. Also really hard to find a group because living in asia and playing on Bigglesworth.
---
Current questing zone in STV and Arathi Highlands.
---
Level 37 Tauren Shaman.
---
What should i do to level up quick? Just grind some mobs?
---
As a healer what I’m tired of is the opposite. People trying to copy off of their favorite streamers and AoE clear everything. Mages are the huntards of classic and have probably caused more deaths than the Fel Reaver.
---
Obviously they don’t expect to get caught.
---
Sounds like California
---
Give an example.  The stats on your bis helmet, shoulders, gloves, leggings, and quite a few other things don't even closely resemble what SC has on it.
---
So i imagine what happened is people who were ganked were just reporting everyone who was up there as griefers and you probably just got lumped in.
---
Uhh just delete and reroll, problem solved.
---
Adding pre-MC content at any stage other than right now is doomed to fail. Im still surprised that they locked Dire Maul to p2. The new content will be run a few times because of novelty but unless the rewards will make it worthwhile it will just be ignored. And if the new content is planned as parallel content, people will run the one which is easier&amp;faster.
---
Should be on the account drop down menu on the wow tab. I'm not near my pc though.
---
Glad your enjoyed it mate, cheers
---
They have talent which grant him for every crit 10 rage. Feral tanks never run out of rage. And their maul (same as warriors heroic strike) generate more threat. So feral don't need to taking damage to generate rage.
---
I think that's excessive too. IMO life sentences (or these super-long pseudo-life sentences) should not be issued unless someone is actually causing physical harm, like murder or rape.
---
Anyone who advocates for a 10-year sentence for a video game DDoS attack does not fully grasp how long 10 years really is.
---
No, I'm comparing killing low-level players to killing low-level players. In one case, they banded together and killed me. In the other, they mass-reported me instead.
---
Sometimes the fucking totem sometimes just decides to not work at all as well. In WC our rogue was sleeped 3 meters from my tremor totem. He stood there in sleep for the next 10+ seconds.

What? It's very difficult because it requires a botnet to do, otherwise it will get almost immediately filtered by any basic ddos mitigation service.

Idk sounds like a crazy idea to me.

Classic Blizzard "call centre" GM; goes to any lengths possible to not actually read or respond to any direct questions.

Anyone remember when it actually felt like you were talking to a human being?

Yes that is a genuine argument on any server with high/full population

I'm sad that I missed that.

I’m out here all day swinging occasionally

more like killing players is fine, until to you go to a specific guard free area in a city and repeatedly kill low level players making the game a living hell for them for over an hour this time, and do the same thing in several other instances for less time. You've made a habit out of making lower level players lives hell and it seems someone got tired of needing to deal with the petitions being filed and put you on notice the old fashioned way. The wording "disruptive gameplay" is the big hint, they aren't saying you cheated, they are saying that you sitting there shitting on noobs trying to get to the flight point for an hour with a group is disruptive.
---
Well sure, but having a discussion about all this is the whole reason for this post. I am waiting for a reply in the meantime, but since I can't play this is all I've got, WoW-wise.

Exactly. There are so many posts on this sub that could be solved with a little bit of typing on the keyboard rather than whinging. Yesterday in SM Cath the tank was taking it quite easy and the mage said “feel free to step it up - we can handle it” , and as the healer I agreed we had plenty spare to deal with things, so he did. Problem solved

Oh, you mean different ranks. I do that. I thought you meant multiple binds for the same exact spell
---
I didn't know this. I ran to Gadgetzan for the FP the other day and literally figured out how to get on top of every building and ran all the way around the wall without falling off, but I do that most everywhere I go. One of my favorite things in Mmo's, which is why I really like Guild Wars 2,is exploration and pushing the limits of the environment. I couldn't figure out how to get on the cage though, but now I guess I won't try either.
---
Not stupid, but a lot of players are trying REALLY hard to pull 1 pack and not AoE it down.

No, I was hoping to use the starter version mentioned on the website to get to level 20 and see if I felt like paying to continue.

Is that option only available for the retail version?

---
I played a rogue in vanilla and loved it. Yes it does seem like a lot but stealth runs are just amazing to do. Lockpicking isn’t bad to skill up either. If you like the idea of sneaking around and taking things out while leaving them unable to do anything about it, rogue is for you. Stun lock any class and you’ll feel the pure power of it. You can do that with nothing but weapons equipped so armor type isn’t really an issue. 
---
I loved the class and really had a blast. Now I’m playing a priest as I started to enjoy that more around cata and wanted to level one in classic.

DDoS'ing is a very good way to hide your steps when attempting to "hAcK" servers. On the company side, you have around 10-20k probs more players and connections to a server. This is extremely manageable by blizzard. Standard. However when you have 100-200k incoming connections to a server. It's becomes much more difficult to defend(and moreso track) a targeted attack inside the server. Chances are someone found an exploit in the wow servers and was going to attempt something illegal. Like installing backdoor access for him/her(although who knows). When blizzard noticed the ddos. it wasn't necessarily the server "going down", although i'm sure it was struggling. It was blizzard turning off the server, trying to find any form of exploit in their systems, and tracking down the source of the DDoS attack(which they had to contact law enforcement for). Chances are there was something much more malicious going on besides a basic ddos attack

Yes.

yeah afaik its not any better for pve, just pvp

Make everything a bit harder and challenging.

That's what he basically said?
---
It does, just seems rarer. I haven't played in forever but Pandaria had some pretty good storms and I know the snowy place in WoD had some good blizzards.
---
Interesting... I enjoy jumping on things, and reading through the comments, it sounds like this is allegedly a common knowledge exploit thing, and it's the first time I'm personally hearing about it. yikes.
---
Guess I'm glad I stopped playing on a PvP server. I could have easily gotten in trouble and had no idea why just for having a bit of wholesome fun.
---
They should function the same. "Up to" refers to the spell damage coefficient related to cast time.

Wand damage being affected by spell damage should be considered a bug.

"slap on the wrist" not really. Missed Ony kill, Missed Rag kill, and chance I won't make roster now due to being a rogue, a heavily contested class for raids. but yeah, I am appealing it, because it's ridiculous.
---
honestly most horde ??'s have rode past me not giving a fuck on Fairbanks. But I think it just depends on the situation/server/etc.

This is the wrong rotation for leveling btw. It’s charge -&gt; berserker stance -&gt;  b rage -&gt; SA to X% -&gt; ms &gt; ww 
---
It’s important to be checking the DPR values of SA with a spreadsheet to find out what that X% is, or use the ballpark values in fight club discord.
---
On alliance I've been selling pretty steadily at 2 gold 50 silver a stack on the low end. Most I got for a stack was 5G though so not too bad.
---
From my memory and experience it's like, DoT = low chance of breaking it, regular direct hits = moderate chance, critical direct hits = high chance.
---
Plus, there is a check against the targets shadow resistance every tick (2 sec) that may break it.

DPS is important, but so is speed. For example I would prefer a 1.2 speed 32 DPS to a 1.7 speed 35 DPS. Over a longer fight the 35 dps will do more damage, but in shorter fights the faster 32 dps wand might get in an extra attack, which would total more damage overall.  If you user the wand for 3.8 seconds the 1.2 speed will get on three attacks for a total of 3x 32 while the 1.7 would only have time for two attacks for 2x 35. Getting in the last extra attack before the mob dies is easier with a faster wand.
---
People did this in vanilla too, nothing new so long as they say it at the start of the run and are clear on it i don't see the issue.
---
But BWL will be released in phase, so it’s still a lot of time until then and the majority of players right now is around level 40 I guess.
---
DESIGNATED SHITTING VALLEY
---
Don't forget all the dead guys running around.
---
Not frost nova'ing enemies on top of your healer.
---
Do I rain of fire at start and hellfire to finish?
---
Is there any way at all to sample even a tiny bit of WoW Classic without dropping $15 for that first month subscription?
---
If a gm tells you to stop doing something, you stop. If you keep doing it, you're an idiot.
---
You can tell he's a prick from the way he initially responds to the GM
---
Apprentice?
---
The Undercity was literally made out of Lordaeron's sewer system. Human cities have precedence for full plumbing and the horde decided that said plumbing was nice enough to live in
---
I thought Classic's support was entirely automated?
---
Most can’t hold aggro on multiple targets too well. I’d rather them be overly cautious than have me playing Corpse Run Simulator 2019 for 2 hours.
---
I knew I wasn't crazy....so many clueless hunters tried assuring me everything was fine...this bug has been a HUGE detriment to my pvp experience. FD has been entirely too inconsistent. THANK GOD it's being fixed
---
Not legally.
---
from what i could tell hunters do not have there pet-freedom based skill or silence shot.
---
these 2 things make a hunter too easy to kill for a frost... IF you can get the opening poly off
---
basic strats are things like
---
1. poly hunter and kill his pet (similar strat is used vs a lock with fel hunter) its was originally done to prevent the pre-freedom skill but i could be done simply because of pet dmg
---
2. you nova hunter at close range (and his pet) and just burst him down with instant casts. (or hardcast frostbolts if your safe enough to do so)
---
hunters have a fairly strong deadzone where they cant use the bow or melee skills. so you can nova and stand in that space and just spam instants. once nova breaks you can use a Cone's slow to mirror there movement too stay in the dead zone, then you use blink if they disengage.
---
a hunter is def not a push over but they have enough weaknesses that they'll just die to instant casts from the mage at close range.
---
fairly skill based match up imo, for as many things the mage can do to kill the hunter, the hunter can counter them with pre planning, traps and smart use of there cooldowns.
---
It says may, not will
---
Depends on group composition tbh. If you have good heals and mages frost nova’ing and a tank peeling stragglers, you can Hellfire the whole time. Otherwise you need to adapt accordingly and mix other stuff in
---
Holy fuck, how do you even level at that point? I'd be like level 32 if I did this instead of level 38.
---
Is there any data related to what level 'the bubble' is?
---
Since when has going on Gadgetzan roofs warranted this reaction? Did anyone get punished for this in vanilla? I saw people on those roofs permanently and did it plenty myself and never heard of this. Maybe I was just lucky.
---
If they want to make it a bannable offense now, just add a wall there. Who doesn't love climbing the pipes and just hanging out on top? Wtf.
---
Thank you! The horde one was pretty simple, I just got the alliance glued down and that process wasn’t as bad as I expected. It’s still not as clean as I would like but I can’t complain for my first cuts on acrylic!
---
Lmao
---
Talisaman of Emphereal Power and Zalandarian Hero Charm, both boost spell power a lot on use. Every spell casters wet dream.
---
Gear mostly in a pve group.
---
Need new people in your life mate.
---
Any chance that we could have the option of having seperate lists between characters? At the moment it seems like there's just one single list shared between all your alts, and that's often not appropriate for what you want to make notes of.
---
5-6 mobs getting AoE'd down is not hard to deal with at all. Overly cautious is a 2 hour BRD emp run vs 30-40 minutes.
---
It stems from the silly idea that blizzard cant be trusted with their own game, that it isnt really their own game (because the original devs arent there anymore), and so if they change anything itll open the floodgates to them fucking classic up.
---
Granted, i see where people are coming from but the idea that were going to just hold blizzard to keeping shit 100% the same always and never let the damn game grow or evolve (which is what our subs pay for) is asinine. 
---
So yeah, ive firmly been in the #somechanges camp since day 1
---
That just makes you sound angry your favorite griefing spot is now off limites
---
Awww man you have been missing out. One word Bartender. Get that add-on and hotkey your ui to your hearts content.
---
It´s not canon in the Classic world.
---
Boo, jumping on the inn and pvping in Gadget is a time honored tradition.
---
You can get close. On Herod I sold a single stack for 5g. Otherwise If I just need money fast I put a stack up for 2 gold 50 silver. I also will just buy straight deviate fish and cook them too depending on price. Some dude fucked up and put a stack of fish up for 1 silver and I bought that shit real fast lol.
---
I'm not saying it should be that low... there's a middle ground here, and it's somewhere between "10 years in jail" and "slap on the wrist". Say, 5 years and a $100,000 fine (approximately) would be sufficient to deter it without ruining people's lives.
---
This is bad advice mate, minimizing drink time is what separates the fast mage levelers. Spirit and efficient wanding is important, drinking after every mob is incredibly slow
---
That's an insane requirement but would only really be for a dps only druid.
---
I ran BRD on the classic private servers a few years back a grand total of 48 times before I won my HoJ. So whilst I'm happy for you... Fk you, man... Fk you, but good job
---
I ran vc at 17, but yeah most people will look for higher especially if their group is on the low side anyway. Plus rogues are highly played so maybe they already had a rogue, maybe they just wanted more range, maybe a hunter was lead and wanted the gear?
---
It happens, i mained a rogue in original vanilla and while i don't remember finding groups being a struggle while leveling at 60 when running for pre raid BiS or shadowcraft it could be tough finding a group because people didn't want competition and there was so many rogues
---
They use Arcane Explosion instead of taking bong hits while channeling Blizzard.
---
What if you did everything behind TOR, could you be caught?
---
As does Dalaran and Lordaeron.
---
Since Horde don't have outhouses, I'm guessing they either use their feces for building or food, or both.
---
&gt;I'm more likely to get stabbed or attacked with Acid in the UK than I am to get shot in the US.
---
That doesn't sound true at all. (A quick google)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate]shows that the UK has a intentional homicide rate of 1.2 per 100 000, while the US has 5.3 per 100 000.

Where are you getting those facts from?

---
R U OK?
---
+1 
---
We’re not all paladins.
---
Yeah I noticed toxicity levels of orc players dropping post BC release.
---
I wonder if they migrated to blood elves.
---
Undeads are still toxic though, and night elves/gnomes I didn’t forget about you alliance.
---
Don’t mind me just musings on the patterns I noticed with what types of players are more commonly attracted to certain races.
---
So I'm following:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-leveling-classic-wow
---
The Arms path. Is the reason you would use imp. Overpower due to the benefit from Deep wounds?
---
Would it be 'better' to swap imp. overpower to imp. charge? 
---
OR
---
drop 2 points in 2h weapons, and get both imp charge and overpower? I think this option is more attractive for me, but is it a blatant 'bad' option?
---
Hunters don't wear mail til 40 and their stat priority is agi/Stam same as rogues and ferals so this Hunter wasn't out to get you.
---
You’re just retarded, got it
---
Why the fuck, did this turn me on?
---
Yeah, he isn't that kind of hacker. Reverse engineers behind Nostalrius? Valuable input and demonstrable technical prowess. This was just some script kiddie. Far from the first, far from the last.
---
I would probably do the same. That isn't really what happened here, though.
---
Haha awesome.
---
You are clearly in the wrong. That is a well known area to avoid the guards in PVP situations. He tried to warn you, and you continued to go against his wishes. Also, arguing with a GM is not a great idea.
---
Why cannot I not see the "Magecraft" quest for mages?  I am 52 and it starts at 50.
---
Yea that was my first thought as well
---
Yea thats what logic tells us.. but again, 3 days man..
---
Pan shot!
---
BURN THE WITCH
---
He issued you a warning, and you probably weren't the only one. You continued to keep trying, regardless of your intentions you basically looked them dead in the eye and gave them the middle finger. This GM seemed super cool, there's probably a few that would have said f it I warned here's a couple hour ban. Honestly wish they'd open up the arena and allow cross faction dueling. I feel like they missed a golden opportunity in vanilla.
---
90 minutes is a massive exaggeration, it was a problem for a whole weekend
---
It’s like a Veigar ult. Just a big ol’ outplay button.
---
My bad, will start hugging more trees.
---
Millions,  it's easy to forget there is millions of us playing this game. And be hit retail and overwatch too.
---
Should of been undead or dwarf rogue
---
You don’t “live” anywhere in the game though haha. And even if you did, you could just choose to live in Ironforge instead of Stormwind.  Problem solved!
---
...spaghetti
---
Guess we found the warrior
---
Also, Earth Shock does a lot of extra threat, so if you're in a dungeon, you want to use rank 1 for interrupts and not pull aggro with massive damage.
---
Nah didn't happen
---
I understand using it to avoid guards, but... you're not allowed to go up there just for funsies? :o
---
Reminder that safespotting is an exploit and you can be reported for it
---
Horde outnumber Alliance on 14/23, Alliance outnumber Horde on 9/23. So it's a lot closer than you think. 
---
http://classicrealminfo.com:5001/
---
Yeah how dare classic recreates how classic was played..
---
I love how the people here conveniently forget that mage stacking was a common leveling strat in vanilla.
---
Not him dying is badass obviously but the windfury stacking. Ive been trying to get the weapon to see if it does that exact thing and its good i havnt just been wasting my time. I dunno.
---
Sorry I misread your comment.
---
Lol I play rogue and as soon as I read that part my thought process was "I'd instantly drop group and hearth without a word".
---
I’ve always wondered if it’s possible to get there as a troll
---
I would not call the US sentencing system a "good thing" I was pointing out to an audience of mostly Americans that the max penalty is not what we generally think it to be. Most people over here when you say that think decades. This guy will get what? Five years at most?

Level 50 class quests were implemented during 1.13, we are on 1.12
---
Script kiddie who was big enough to take down Blizzard..  
---
kid was using some 0days for sure. Having that large of a botnet isn't a simple task.
---
This is how I handle it. On Stalagg horde outnumber us 2:1 so picking fights isn't really worth it most of the time anyway. But if someone goes out of their way to fuck with us, they'll pay in spades.
---
They don’t love it and it’s a pretty popular opinion there that M+ sucks. People just do it because it’s the best way to gear up and they’re addicted to the game.
---
In retail, I played Alliance, and there's no interaction, so couldn't care less. Moved to a private server a few years ago, rolled horde for something different, then hated the alliance. Now for classic, I'm back to alliance, because of friends and it didn't take me long to hate the horde now. Mostly undead rogues. I still have a soft spot for people that will play nice and I'll help them out, but it also seems like the horde has been worse to the alliance in terms of ganking and fighting unfairly.
---
That auction of tender wolf meat selling made that story.
---
Yeah they have special provisions to keep homicidal maniacs like that guy in prison, but for normal things you're not getting more than 20 years.
---
We’re unbanned bois see you out there.
---
Firelord Emperor Trump
---
Well the last guy that did it in 2010 is still in prison for it. That wasn't even as bad as this one so..
---
Sounds like you've got some shitty friends
---
Well. It comes with practice and learning but you can always get out of range when you think the fear is coming. Priest fear is a short range iirc.
---
Yeah, looking like Rambo is cool though.
---
Saw a player with 5/8 nightslayer yesterday. Basically a god.
---
A Horde skull cracker
---
No, he is farming for the essence. Running a more lucrative aoe farm for raw gold is more efficient because you can buy the item off the AH.
---
I'm gonna say yes. :)
---
It sounds like you need to switch to a more hardcore guild.  The style of play your referencing is more of a standard style that most people are used to.  BRD emp taking 2 hours is kinda ridiculous, but 40 minutes is very fast in my book.
---
I had this on my hunter in classic for fun.  That said, I farmed it alone so no one was missing it :D
---
Just thought of how bliz can incorporate classic into their esports, dungeon speed running
---
Instances? Idk..
---
10 minimum I would say unless they're really young. Wouldn't surprise me to see 30 years at all.
---
What race would you recommend for rogue? For solo PvP is it easier being on alliance or horde? I heard rogues are way better vs shamans than they are vs palis so I assumed horde rogue is easier, but I don't know enough to be sure
---
Has absolutely nothing to do with jumping on buildings, Blizz doesn't give a flying just about stuff like that. This is purely because you were trying to evade guards in a neutral zone. That is someone Blizz takes very seriously.
---
Yeah, Fear Ping-pong is an important skill to have. It can be very useful for leveling and dungeons.
---
I must be doing something wrong as a hunter even people at or below my LVL don't drop that fast even of they were afk it takes me ages too whittle them down
---
I didn t reroll 10 times
---
1) Is Leatherworking worth picking up? I'm a lv24 druid and currently have Herbalism and Skinning for the income. I'm not sure if I'll have enough money to keep LW up-to-date to craft gear for my level, and at Lv60 it doesn't seem *that* necessary as I can just buy the crafted gear/armour kits from other people?
---
2) Is it possible to level a priest painlessly? I got mine to lv15 and questing is a huge struggle, I can barely kill mobs my level and it takes forever. I also want to go healer, but if I'm not shadow I'm afraid of being vulnerable in world PVP. :(
---
Where do they get the data?
---
all nvidia cards have shadow play, which can be setup to save hte last X minutes of gameplay
---
Laughts in Fear Ward!
---
Jesus Herbert Christ your UI made me vomit.
---
What addon is that?
---
Youll have to hold onto those for awhile yet to get a good price for them, right now people are leveling professions and saving for their epic mount and don't have extra money to spend on vanity stuff
---
So.... you come from Retail, you want to "go go go", and are upset others don't have the same mindset?
---
Hmmm....
---
What do you mean by "the bubble"?
---
I know it doesn't add much, and I don't really have enough time to devote to giving a thorough response, but I have a visceral disagreement with a lot of what OP says. It just comes off as, at best, anecdotal, and at worst, very elitist. 
---
That being said, to each their own. I hope OP finds a good group of people that want to play the same way they do. In the meantime, maybe stop trying to push what you want onto all the others too? It's a double edged sword an the player base is just too diverse.
---
Have you cranked the view distance graphic settings to 10? I can see pretty far.
---
Apparently you don't know the rate at which rumors spread.
---
Shamans don’t have to have a pocket Priest/Paladin to make those clips?
---
Are we certain about that? I checked that very thing recently, got dotted by a lock and feared by mobs, no durability hit and I'm pretty sure a mob got the last hit
---
Clean asshole master-faction.
---
Being nice to the opposite faction.
---
I mean that is the most garbage AoE comp you could ask for. The shadow priest is probably oom after every pull and the hunter not much longer after.
---
Why even use it when you can do the same thing with your bullshit wind fury procs?
---
-salty guy who got one shot by a shaman recently.
---
Has anybody considered that, if this is a young kid, the government may be more interested in employing him rather than imprisoning him? Isn't DDoSing a relatively difficult thing to accomplish on a scale like that?
---
&gt;I love that the long grind and faction restriction commits players to a side. And those sides feel more real
---
Bruh, I legit bought a window decal sticker for that reason alone. I never would have done this for anything after WotLK.
---
Realistically priest will always heal some atleast in ZF where every huge pull will include atleast one caster if your lucky.
---
I try to give what I can, but I have been trying to avoid even Flight paths on that mount grind. I probably should have leveled as arms instead tbf
---
Not exactly. A Rogue might use their ranged weapon to pull, but that's it. I use my melee weapon constantly as a Hunter, Raptor Strike is a non-trivial portion of my DPS.
---
It's not the main priority by any means, but a nice slow weapon which also has Agility and/or Int and Spirit is huge help in leveling, for longevity(Int/Spirit) and big whacks to finish a mob off as I pull aggro off my pet toward the end.
---
Maybe he or she was mentally ill...
---
I think you'll be surprised. It's not a perfect net, but it will catch a lot of fish.
---
Then you wait for autohit and...miss. You got enough rage for ms and they...dodge. You know they are dead with the next overpower, but you miss again...

Hey!  I'm an artist (writer/filmmaker) and I love gaming.
---
I'll be your IRL friend.
---
Druid main here. Feral (which is 15/31/5, or a close variation) is faster kills and still allows you to cast spells and heal. At the start of a pull. At 60 I'd respec. You want to kill mobs at a faster speed than is really feasible for using your dots. Cat form should be your main leveling form. However, if you don't care about speed, I'd go balance of you solely want to cast or Resto if you want a mix of spells and feral in each fight.
---
What server? ...just wondering
---
Dude I would love to do a full brd run, I don't care if it takes 6 hours.

Didn't work too great for me this evening. Had me running all over the place and wasting tons of time traveling

Finally a blue post on this issue. Nice!

Why not keep running it?

Update 1:10 AM population slices:
---
Shamans level 26-28 on Stalagg: 19 ... Faerlina: 27
---
Priests level 26-28 on Stalagg: 17 ... Faerlina: 28
---
New characters level 1-4 in Durotar on Stalagg: 18 ... Faerlina: 50
---
Sorry, i'm at work, got distracted.
---
I meant, where the majority of people are in the levelling process.
---
Anecdotally, I feel like (on my server at least) it's late 30s/ZF levels
---
BM all the way. Pet scales with level not gear
---
Probably not.  Started 1 week after release, in 2004.
---
But not sure why it matters.  You are infected with the Retail "go go go, faster faster faster" mentality that is killing WoW.
---
Don't bring it to Classic.  Go back to Retail if you want that game style.
---
"Go back to retail" ah yes, you're very friendly. Certainly a community man out here.
---
Not very well from what ive seen and heard.
---
Better off fishing for greater sagefish (good for leveling cooking), oily blackmouth and firefin snapper. Any other fish that gives a good buff when cooked will sell well.
---
As a mage main, the worst matchups are warlock, shadow priest, ele / resto shaman, hunter and druid (a lot of bad matchups for what's supposed to be a very good PvP class!).
---
Hunters are incredibly hard to play properly in PvPs, and a badly played hunter will get shit on by a decent mage. 
---
Personally I'd recommend shaman or warlock because they have tools to consistently stop mages from using their many survivability / disengage spells. Shadow priests will fuck mages in a 1v1 gentleman's duel, but realistically the mage is just gonna disengage from the fight and disappear into the ether while you begrudgingly look on
---
A minor tweak I'd make to this is charging in and using that + bloodrage to quickly build rage for SB/Rev.
---
Doesn't pay shit
---
Vendor Price I’m pretty sure
---
As a tank same. As for the go go go crowd sorry I don’t meet your standards. To the OP also if your already raiding you can go ahead and move yourself up to hardcore your not casual you may be in a casual guild but yeh most players aren’t near raiding yet.
---
Remember that u can use mail at 40... Get helm from armory and gloves from cath

Why ruin other people’s enjoyment of a beautiful game
---
Word gets around the cell block about your master hacker skills. Big Tony Cappriotti hears about it and thinks you'll fit perfectly into his big plan. He has a heist ready to go as soon as he's out of the big house and he needs a good tech guy. If you can pull it off, you're a made man, but if things go wrong... well, you don't want things to go wrong.
---
He's already set everything up. And this is an offer you can't refuse. Time to get into the prison library and see how fast you can learn how to brute force a 256 bit encryption by hand.
---
Tell him!
---
I have always have a fascination for DmD. I have never played the real deal but we dabbled into role playing board games back when we were teens. It was fun. And it ignited something in me. Something that I kinda felt was close but no sigar. I remember I wanted more....more action, a little bit quicker action and I did not want to feel the plunge in quality we felt when the game master mate wanted to go home lol. 
---
Then wow came and that same feeling I got ignited when playing board games was present. And the immersion was tenfold and I could actually walk around without rolling a dice. It was “heaven on Earth”
---
Actually, as a hordie my friend and I once accidentally stepped too close to Southshore and got chased and killed by a hunter that was skull level to us. We didn't gank anyone our only crime was getting a little too close to an alliance settlement and  barely dodging the guards. Oh, I feared her pet but other than that, we did nothing to them. :/
---
You can definitely get there, just takes a little bit of jumping starting from Felwood. It's worth the trip!
---
May I ask which version you use? I cant get the glow/graphics to work, only a couple of buttons. Seems like lots of ppl have this problem, but yours seems to work fine :)
---
how dare you insinuate that this fine, young, woman just trying to make her way in the world, is some kind of machine!
---
and a russian one no less
---
shame on you
---
Maybe it’s like in the Harry Potter universe where wizards and witches just vanish the shit away with a wand.
---
It turns out that mages serve an even more vital function outside conjuring food and water than we thought.
---
I’ve gotten two of my 12 slot bags from them so far! Now to replace my other two 10 slots.
---
I get that. That's why I'd be fine with other people not being able to see it.
---
But (at least from my PoV...)WoW's armor isn't really..."sick armor".
---
It's a hodgepodge of clashing colors/styles/textures up to the point where you get the class tier sets and then everyone looks (mostly) the same.
---
A lot of the nominally "protective" gear has gaps in the stomach or neck area, or is something like a short-sleeved t-shirt made of mail. Also the boobplate on some pieces. 
---
The thing that gets me the most is that **dye items exist in-universe**. They're used in crafting. Why the hell does a blue linen robe have different enchantments on it than a red one? 
---
I get it's an artifact of the time and the existence of/reliance on palette-swapped gear that a lot of contemporary RPGs used, but visual customization is an avenue to let players engage with the world without just adding power creep. 
---
I dunno, maybe just being used to playing stuff like City of Heroes (superhero MMO from around the WoW days with amazing visual customization) or Final Fantasy XIV (has a "glamour" system that's integrated with the lore as illusion spells) has spoiled me a bit. 
---
I think the people that like having a lot of visual customization end up liking it more because their characters look is *theirs*, that they made, from the choices they have available from the stuff they've unlocked. 
---
But "wear your achievement" is also a thing, and it's nostalgic for people. So that's why I'd rather whatever solution they go with doesn't break the...uh...nostalgic verisimilitude? I'm not even sure if that's a phrase.
---
&gt; Who's wearing what armour with Tramsmog? Nobody knows.
---
FFXIV handles this by adding something to the "Inspect"/"Examine" feature. When you look at someone's gear, the first thing you see is what it actually "is". If you hover over it long enough, the description then changes to what it's Glamoured as.
---
Well if you wanna do damage on every boss it would still mean you have to farm aprox. 6 hours per week for the raids assuming you have no wipes.
---
Say what now?
---
Yooooo, that xqc guy is lit 😂😂😂
---
Instance limit still applies, 5 per hour.
---
No, you do not need to be in a city, just type /join lookingforgroup while in game. You should then see everyone who has also joined, /5.
---
It's true, I actually completely forgot about this until I saw the post
---
Only if it's your kid, according to a post from a few days ago
---
I really never understood this. There was just as much world PVP at low levels, except this time without max lvl characters shitting on low level characters during downtime between BGs and raids; at max lvl, there was the isle of quel danis which was a 24/7 fucking massacre. Also flying mounts were luxurious as fuck for most of the early stages of the game, and resources still had a lot of contention. I played on a pve server anyway during its original debut, but on pservers I remember there being wpvp aaaaalll the time while in outlands; except this time it was harder to get corpse camped and druids were even more impossible to kill.
---
If I was the Alliance in this situation I would have stood next to you /cheering as you tamed it until you successfully completed the channel. 
---
Then I would have killed your pet. 
---
And then you.
---
That's the biggest difference for me, I've been really enjoying the levelling process.
---
His comment isn’t even true, Im level 34 and have yet to see a gold piece reward. Most are around 70-85 silvers.
---
MANY WHELPS  
---
HANDLE IT
---
I have a few selected hunters on my friendlist who I invite to dungeons. These are good hunters who know what they do. The other hunters can fuck right off.
---
Those are the Spanish and Portugese language servers, in case you don't know.
---
Not forever, but until naxx yes
---
If you also let your tank roll for bows then because an initial pull with an epic is WAY more impactful than with a green bow, sure.
---
You don't have to hold on all 6. IDC if I'm healing the rogue who pulls one off the tank. However, if there is a mage, they'll just nova and keep the mobs within melee range of the tank. 2-3 should go down pretty fast with single target from the rogue + warrior, I just stun one that's going for another dps. 
---
Everything dies and it's more mana efficient. All it takes is 2 seconds to let the warrior do his thing.
---
20g is a mooncloth bag.
---
Just an FYI but stopping so that you can bank rested XP is slower than just continuing to level that character. You would level faster by continuing to play at 100% experience instead of stopping to rack up any amount of Rested XP.  RXP is just meant to be a bonus as an incentive for logging out at an inn or city, not an actual play style.
---
side fact: it was originally designed to work the opposite way; the "rested" experience rate would be 100% and the "normal" experience rate would be 50% of that. Feedback from the beta showed that people didn't like feeling like they missing out so they changed it to expressed the exact same numbers but as a "bonus" for resting at a town/inn rather than making it a "penalty" for not.  So rested XP isn't completely bogus or anything, but the psychology surrounding it is manipulative, at best.
---
tl;dr there's no reason to stop playing to bank rested XP and it's better not to.
---
Nice art though!
---
Which is funny because they used to be way cheaper before they were nerfed.
---
Do SFK at 25 - 3 quests, one from UC 2 from sepulcher - all shareable
---
BFD at 27 - 2 quests from Zoram gar outpost, one quest drops from Naga priestess in front of the dungeon (damp note) - sends you back to outpost and you get another quest. Inside a quest starts as well near the turtle boss in a small side cave. Then where you loot the core a boss will spawn who drops another quest
---
RFK at 30. You Need 30 to get the quest from UC which has a follow up for SM. I would ignore the quest from ratchet. There is also another quest from tb (need lvl 29).
---
I only want to do every dungeon once and that’s how i do it after WC. After RFK you can grind SM if you’re that hyped for dungeon grinds. The levels I listed are also good orientation points as tank.
---
I think it's to indicate that the amount of silver from the guy was not insignificant, as they are a lower level.
---
Imagine not fortifying your buildings with S P I K E S
---
Warriors don't need slow 2hs outside pvp
---
Quel'Danas was a no-fly zone so this further reinforces his argument
---
Yup, this. Rage starvation is a thing. It's hard enough to tank 3 elites when the DPS goes Crazy after 2 seconds, but 6? Might as well not tank anything.
---
That being said, you don't need to wait for full mana every pull. If I see the healers mana is ok, p I usually pull the next pack while DPS kills the last from the previous pack
---
I'm doing all those quests that make you go across the continent 3 times for like 4900xp.
---
Paladins are only really good in two roles:
---
Healing Tanks
---
Middle of the pack DPS that uses gear most people don’t want and brings buffs.
---
Even if you wanted ALL the Paladin buffs you need 4, and it’s kinda redundant at some point.
---
Blessing of Light, King, Might, Sanctuary on tanks
---
Blessings of Light, Salv, Wisdom, Kings on casters
---
Blessings of Light, Salve, Might, Kings, on melee DPS. 
---
Auras you get Devo, Concencration, Sanctity, and Elemental resist out of it.
---
Experiencing the same issues, I was doing pickpockets in SM at lower levels a week ago, now I'm 60 doing BRD and getting resisted a lot more.
---
Except it's not a go go go mentality, it's literally BEING EFFICIENT. Why WOULDN'T you go faster if you have the gear for it? It quite literally makes no sense. Your mentality will kill classic much faster than mine.
---
Classic(vanilla) leveling is alot of zone hoping, if the current zone is to high.. Find another zone for your level and start questing there, get a few level until it also gets to hard, jump back to previous zone and continue. The whole meme about vanilla being a running simulator is no joke lol. Goodluck.
---
I literally couldn’t care less how you feel about any addon, and nothing about my comment about indicates otherwise. You’re just being unnecessarily aggressive and freaking out on people over nothing
---
I've mainly played Alliance over the years and I definitely see more toxicity on the alliance side. However, I just started playing since Classic Launch and I only play early in the morning through early afternoon (night shift) so I probly play with more adults. Whereas when I played alliance I was still doing school.
---
My druid out leveled my friends, so to even it out, I spend a lot of time leveling professions and grinding for mats and items to sell. It's actually been way nicer than I thought it would be.
---
Ah :(
---
I had such hopes. I'll give it a shot w/ a new char compared to a lv. 10 that I levelled previously and see what it's like.
---
Although Questie's pretty solid for me - i personally didn't like aap but that was just a couple of settings that i cbf'd changing/finding out how to change
---
Dude, go back and fix the grammar mistakes and then I'll give it a read. It's borderline unreadable.
---
It’s easier to time and snipe a last hit with a higher damage, slower wand, which is beneficial for priests that have taken the spirit tap talent.
---
I mean engineering actually gives you an edge over every non engineer by having bombs to throw at people.
---
Time to remember people of [this] (https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok).
---
&gt;also your drawing looks way cooler than he really looks lmao
---
As is pre-transmog tradition.
---
Hahahahahahaha.
---
You say you’re a cross between hardcore and casual, leaning towards hardcore.  
---
The way you speak sounds really hardcore, and maybe you should look for people to play with that have a similar mindset. Regardless of how easy or feasible clearing dungeons more quickly and what not is, some players aren’t willing to play that way. Some wanna play it safe, others aren’t competent, others are just along for the ride. That’s how it’s always been, and you can’t ask for every player of your group to specifically burn down packs and mobs the most efficient way every time - it’s just not gonna happen.
---
I get that. But it directly flies in the face that there was no wpvp. I’m not saying flying didn’t curtail it by a significant margin, but to say it was dead was an understatement. Especially if an area like the isle was in existence.
---
BC had issues but wpvp being dead was definitely not one of them for me.
---
5g peak hours 10g off hours.
---
By that logic all chests should be first come first serve than since blizzard hasn’t made them “called by need or greed”? No, because that is selfish and greedy.
---
Not care about petty stuff like when someone ninjas something or being chill after a wipe due to a silly mistake
---
Shit I use a keyboard macro to not afk and I haven’t gotten banned it’s probably just a mistake
---
This is the only arguement point that catches my attention
---
Remember, Shaman and Paladin are faction restricted, so you can double their numbers to get a more accurate look at how they compare to other healers.
---
Don't say things like this when there's no math to back it up at all. You're implying that some person actually ran numbers and sims on this and found that it's better than having another rogue in that slot, which is a lofty claim.
---
And Undercity IS plumbing.
---
How do you walk away from someone who's obtained your address? You underestimate people.
---
They act like other world nodes in groups - people who can gather them roll or take turns.
---
This is amazing
---
Part of the problem with a record is it hinders your ability to get visas in many places
---
Or he just knows some people who knows some people
---
Legit one character i was rolling had blacksmithing as his proffession, Every chest the first 9 or so levels had a single silver bar in it. Definitely worth it to not pass on chests. I also got an 8 slot bag from a raptor on the same character when leveling in the barrens yesterday. So that made me happy.
---
It would be bullshit if it was wrong. Sure there are good hunters. But there are a ton of bad hunters and hunters just like to compete on fucking everyones gear. You are a heal and wear cloth? A hunter will probably roll on your gear or at least your weapon. You are a warrior? A hunter will roll on your weapons. You are a mage? A hunter will roll on your gear. You are a rogue? A hunter will roll on your gear.
---
Why would I willingly take in a class that competes with the entire group if I can take in a class that brings more to the group (like a warlock, mage, druid or shaman) and simultaneously does not compete on everyone's gear.
---
You can't trick me with your poo be gone gag jack black
---
That's another thing, the one's that are personally manned always get angry if you so much as mention that, as if that isn't the very first thing anyone with half a brain would do to a random hot girl messaging them on social media.
---
40 man raid and they can't have multiple people kicking?
---
&gt;*/p for party, /y for parties*
---
The server I am currently on is Mankrik, it pretty even for both alliance and horde pop, I believe more toward horde now.
---
No it's not?
---
yeah i can see them but how do i talk in it?
---
You pay 15 bucks a month for shitty photos of a screen taken with a phone?
---
The future of the game will be fine
---
There is a complete support tree for shaman. Resto.
---
Ah I see. 
---
I'd agree with you, I've rerolled a few times and I've noticed appreciably less people in the late 20's where I am. I'd say mid 30s.
---
It's funny cuz I haven't played for 3 days because of big number of commissions and the series. 😆 good rested exp, tho.
---
Nice. I'm on alliance as well on Benediction in Hakuna Matata.
---
I'm pugging all of my runs and until sunday, only me and 2 others were at 60. There are no groups pugging healers, and there are very limited spots in hardcore guilds. I don't have pserver experience, I never bothered. Most hardcore guilds want either pserver experience or multiple CE's from retail (lol, for classic).
---
That is so fucking funny
---
Bro. A little chill next damn damn
---
Try Google prebis warlock set 😊
---
Im really thinking rerolling as warrior. But Ive wasted so much time on my rogue. 
---
I just dont think thats my playstyle. 
---
I dont like hiding 90% of the time, i dont like slowly walking up to others. I don’t like the feeling of fearing any class that can survive my initial attack. 
---
Warrior is much more me. But damn, I almost don’t wanna start over.
---
You’d be surprised. I’ve ran into a couple of people multiple times on Stalagg
---
They were easier to get in every other xpac
---
type "/5 (your message here)"
---
As someone who mains a warrior and has a Hunter as an alt that isn't even close to comparable.
---
Has the classic developer team already stated though that its up to the communities demands? They only talked about TBC because the community said they might want that. 
---
Also when they talked about TBC they stated it would be on its own servers. They will always have a classic server going that is untouched. Even if they did classic+ they would still have an untouched amount of classic servers running. 
---
Remember, we only have classic because the community kept asking for it. Your reasoning behind them never releasing classic plus because money is the same reasoning people had behind classic never being released in the first place. Which proved to be completely wrong. 
---
They already had to spend a bunch of man hours porting the old 1.12 client to the modern client as is. Im willing to bet an arm and a leg we will not only get TBC if the community asks for it. But also classic plus if the community demands that too.
---
2 weeks live servers, lets assume 7 days to 60, so 1 week @ max  
---
26330 kills are needed to get to exalted (+some quests and cloth turn ins)  
---
so lets say each kill equates to around 30 seconds
---
THATS 220 HOURS (a week is 168 hours) =&gt;not possible  
---
ok, lets say you have a 5 man group of level 60 nolifers, you spread out in the pirate camps and you kill anything that spawns and make the grind a little more efficient for all of you.  
---
you assume a kill is around 60 seconds because spawn timers and just keeping everything dead as much as possible  
---
divide that by 5 for the group  
---
88 hours. you and your team sat around for almost 4 straight days, or at least 12 hours a day for a week straight, and farmed rep.  
---
That doesnt include pvp, or people questing and tagging mobs, or server resets and que times. No it isnt possible that anyone has grinded out exalted with steamwheedle yet.
---
Unless you are running a ddos to cause a distraction while you use other exploits to sneak in and exfiltrate data ;-)
---
Ret doesn’t have a way to close back in on Baron like those classes do either. Rogues have sprint and warriors can charge macro or intercept back in. Also, Retribution doesn’t have access to the more impactful gear for their spec which comes out in Phase 3.
---
Well aren't you special
---
This.
---
How about never posting dramatic bullshit on this subreddit again for a tip?
---
Lol what? This is such a bad insult major cringe dawg.
---
Not the one in with the melee. You actually can bring several resto shamans to a 40 man raid.
---
Dreadmist for townwear. 
---
Prebis for spelunking.
---
How long would the prison time be for something like this?
---
I haven't really looked into 1) but:
---
- I think people choose 2 gathering profs until 35 and then you drop 1 of them to powerlevel the crafting prof. Reason being is that you can get the top training level at 35 (I think).
---
If you were going LW, you'd drop herb and just use the leather you skin. You may be able to grind out levels whilst grinding for skins as well so it wouldn't be a complete waste of time.
---
I'd also look into the end game patterns and see where they drop and think about if you have a chance of getting them e.g. if you will never raid but everything drops in a raid, there wouldn't be much profitability there.
---
That said, you may be able to carve out a niche for yourself - nfi though.
---
You already said that
---
1 ms!? Are you sure
---
The toxicity of undeads are mostly comprised of people being toxic against undeads
---
Oh, hey lol. We got annihilated by 2 60s right after I did that. Karma, maybe lol
---
*laughs in dwarf priest*
---
He only succeeded in doing the opposite. I’m sure Asmondick acted all butthurt but he got a *lot* of money from that stunt.
---
Ditto. It was simple, yet effective. Some might say, Super Effective
---
Perfect, now I can soul tap it
---
Charge -&gt; bloodrage during charge -&gt; sweepingstrikes on contact -&gt; whirlwind -&gt; use next white hit and sunder on any undamaged mob.  
---
Grats you now have aggro on 6 mobs that will hold through heals and initial aoe. Whirlwind should be back up by the time aoe is ramping up. Depending on where the SS lands and what crits you may lose aggro on 1 or 2 but the mage will nova then and you'll get plenty of rage for a big WW/cleave smack and at any rate things will be dying soon and your main job will be to hamstring and execute runners.
---
Can somebody explain to me what exactly dkp is and how it works?
---
My understanding is that it's points that the guild leaders keep track off to see who gets loot from raids. But why wouldn't people just roll for loot like they do on dungeons?
---
I try to not invite hunters primarily because their pet management is always garbage lol. That said there really shouldn't be competition between warrior weapons and Hunter weapons, doesn't matter how slow a 2h is if it doesn't have agility or AP on it I don't want it.
---
You know how to talk in general chat, you type "/1"?
---
Do that for the number that represents lookingforgroup. I think it's /4? Could be /5?
---
My easy way of remembering it, since I'm not from the south, is to just assume their hand moved to the left when typing the word "gonna", causing the "g" to become an "f" and their "o" to become an "i". It's not right, but it gets the job done.
---
*Laughs in four DoTs*
---
That's why you always jump off the bridge on the right
---
Well if you are doing it with guildmates with voicecom and you have a bottle where at least the number 35% appears very big on, it should be quite a lot of fun.
---
PvE server... can't really do much with the other faction.
---
15 years ago I was a Mage for all of vanilla, BC, and half of WOTLK.  Classic came out and I decided to go polar opposite and roll Warrior.  Its been a long grind, and I want to give up.....  I just dinged 30 and really not looking forward to the rest of the climb..... Someone give me some encouragement.
---
You may want to get Questie as well. It shows all available quests on the world/continent map so you can just go to the zone that has the most ! 
---
before going there though, you may want to google 'breadcrumb quests _____  (ashenvale, STV, desolace etc) to see if there's point to picking them up.
---
And? There was still a bunch of wpvp arpund. Hence flying didn't kill wpvp, which is the point he was making.
---
This is a world of war...craft
---
Wonder if Bonk is a distant relative of Frodo Sagbag.
---
It makes it so it doesn't toggle off a toggle ability if you spam the macro button. So if I use 
---
/cast !Auto Shot 
---
It won't detoggle my auto shot if I spam
---
I hit 18 on my warrior and did my first DM run. told myself it was just a get quests done and then move on. Stayed in westfall and DM for the next 4.5 levels. Decent xp and sooo much cloth for my bandages and the AH
---
Reroll or play holy TBH...dungeons will last you about a couple weeks at 60 and warriors and druids aren't at any disadvantage in those anyway. Prot pally is terrible.
---
thanks i got it lol.
---
I would like to include all gnomes in this
---
Q: What's the currency for buying mount at 40 called?  
---
A: Lifeless Stone.
---
Damn seems soon for this sub to turn to only garbage shit posts.
---
What makes you think they want to come back? Average lifespan of a developer in the industry is like 5 years. I'm sure most of them made their money and are much happier in retirement than crunching themselves in order to make content that gets shit on no matter what they do.
---
For my main as a druid? Absolutely not, I love it!
---
For an alt? Yes, that's why I have made every class and played them some... Still not sure what I want my alt to be, but will probably end up being a warlock instead of priest, mage, or hunter.
---
I leveled a priest to 60 on private servers and will miss the shadowmeld/mind control shenanigans.
---
I just kept questing, hit 44 and had 100 gold and bought it then between vendoring greens I didn't need and vendor trash.
---
Absolutely not, these days it's a 1 way set of tracks to having a very shitty life. Like mentioned it is very easy to DDOS anyone at any time, and is the clumsiest way to do any kind of attack as it's more like standing in front of a door and telling people no rather then actually breaking in.
---
Fair lol
---
Fixed
---
Both smell like shit though
---
Horde because off the poo huts and the Alliance because medieval cities lack plumbing
---
Pretty sure they have to be at least green to you but it's been a while since I have done it.
---
Because not everyone is playing the game to be as "EFFICIENT" as possible when it comes to clear speeds.
---
Some people have other priorities.
---
I personally enjoy "clean" dungeon runs with groups that mark kill targets and CC appropriately.  I'm heals also, and was back in Vanilla.  Its not an issue of needing full mana, or that we are in capable of an AoE speed run.  Speed runs are just not something I enjoy.
---
Again, there is plenty of "faster" game play over on the dead retail servers.  Just go back and enjoy that version of the game.  Don't try to turn Classic dungeons into M+.
---
The thought of that is making my nostrils recede faster than Asmongolds hairline.
---
Anyone manage to pet tank Princess? I spec bm and pet is full armor and nature resist but princess still wrecks my pet. I pull my pet out during dust cloud and mend but just gets owned by auto attacks. 
---
I am level 60 and using broken tooth as pet
---
It also slowed down download services for over 24 hours
---
I agree. I first thought people in this thread were joking about what the penalty could be since it seemed so ridiculously excessive.
---
RIP vendored greens
---
That's also not true. Resto shamans priority for groups is tank group &gt; melee dps groups &gt; casters/healers. Giving your melee windfury is a lot more important then giving your healers mana, killing the boss faster is more effective then giving your casters extra mana. A standard raid comp will have 6-7 shamans, the first 4 is going with all the melee/tanks and the the last 2 will be there for healers/casters.
---
I'm not sure where you learned this info, but it's just false, you can easily look at twitch and watch any of the top horde guilds raid and they always prioritize getting melee windfury over anything else, while bringing 0 enhance shamans.
---
wow alliance camping lowbies. so typical
---
Shaman, druid, hunter.
---
Yeah when I was running around in BRD on retail I was like "holy shit" once I found the bar. 
---
Side note: I really liked the item to get directly into the bar. I used take guildmates into the bar and then gamble on gold.
---
I have handynotes and i can right click (?) a player - that is on my friends list to add a note.
---
e.g. today i added a guy who was a bit of a dick to my friends list and then added a note not to group w/ him
---
So, click 'o' and then add a friend and then right click their name and - hopefully - it'll work
---
More mobs that then go on the frost mage because warr has dogshit aoe threat.
---
Yes, maybe i am just too impatient :)
---
This. This is why I rolled priest to 60 on private servers. This is also why I'm having a horrible time picking an alt, because I like something about every class.
---
lmao, I CC way more in high m+ keys than I do in classic. Yes, let's stop for 1 minute, look at a pack of 3 mobs and mark 2 for sheep/blind and then pull 1 mob. If you find that fun, that's a really big yikes because it only took 3 days for people to realize how much of a joke dungeons are.
---
dots have a lower chance to break fear
---
I ninjad a fadeleaf from a night elf druid and he tried to fight me over it while a mob was on him. I wished I could have asked him if he was really willing to die over a plant.
---
I mean, Westfall is a toilet in general.
---
you're always on the verge of a wipe
---
Thats been the fun part for me so far. Just different opinions though.
---
No.
---
Have you tried playing combat spec? Might be the play style you’re looking for?
---
Going off a different reply...
---
I've just dinged 35 so now I can get max lvl in a crafting profession. 
---
I've got Herb/Skin and I'm thinking I should pick up...BS or maybe enchanting? Or would alchemy be better? 
---
I will be pvping and raiding (hoping to at least) and i think this is probably a good time to drop a gathering prof.
---
Thoughts?
---
This was a thing in vanilla, it was also regularly mentioned on here when people asked for the downsides to a druid healer. 
---
You lack a ress, so if the composition is made up of other classes with no ress and the only spot left is healer they become bottom of the list. 
---
It's rarely a problem, but it does happen. Even 15 years ago some people were to lazy to run back lol.
---
Just do 2v1's if you want to feel like a real man
---
It's a bot, nothing happened next?
---
&gt; It’s because you only know a rogue is there is when the rogue knows he can kill you.
---
Rogues can basically kill anybody at any time if they know what they're doing. Naked and a white dagger? Rogue wins.
---
It just feels so bad being ahead of the curve FINALLY getting mount, spending money doing everything right, to now realize I don’t even enjoy the class.
---
No it shouldn't be allowed cuz the inflation would be too high.
---
It's the thought that counts. Two thumbs up buddy.
---
there would be no way to control it, people would get scammed left and right so, that is already the first reason that it's a big NO NO
---
basically it's the same as ordinary goldselling, so it will be against the rules.
---
oh yeah i should probably have mentioned this is later game when i know the players have money to spare. i never expected money during leveling when were all strapped for cash.
---
Just gonna wait for that ZG Bat, no sweat.
---
As long as you make your intentions known to the group before you start clearing.
---
I wasn’t aware it was a bad thing I just see people do it all the time so I thought it was just polite to do. I took it out. Sorry about that.
---
Trolls were an advanced civilisation before humans were even conceived.
---
Not a very good bot then.
---
So if nothing is a hunter weapon, everything is a hunter weapon. The cycle is complete.
---
It’s the complete opposite on netherwind. Literally did it last night no deaths 1 attempt warrior rogue.
---
Not when I shift into MAXIMUM OVERDIVE!
---
what is the point of throwing frostbolts at some pixels?
---
Just get the goddamn lamp.
---
Yes.
---
Give prot paladins taunt. And ret crusader strike!
---
Does it works with other professions, ie skinning/herbali?
---
Seems more like SF to me
---
Is this game forcing anyone else to reinstall it?
---
Because Horde has easier acces to lvl 30 zone in many cases. 
---
STV has zeps from Undercity and Orgrimmar. 
---
West Arathi just few steps from Tarren Mill and East has Hammerfell and closer to Undercity than Ironforge. 
---
Desolace is closer to Barrens, than Ashenvale and Darnassus, but most of the Horde prefer easy acces to STV anyway.
---
If Alliance wouldn't be grouped they could be easily surpressed by sheer number of Horde players able to travel faster to these locations.
---
Good in theory but it does not work all the time. 
---
Sweeping strikes is a deep arms talent. But lets assume you have it. 
---
You cant change in berserker stance and you cant ww in battle stance. So theres a gcd u miss there.
---
You do not have enough rage for change, bloodrage, ss+zerk stance(loose rage even if you had a lot) + ww. You need a lucky white hit crit or a nice damage income from the mobs you are atracking. (Works with 2h)
---
And with 1h, it wont matter if you can perfectly execute it 1h wont generate enough threat since you are doing it all in battle/zerk stance and lack the extra threat from def stance. I am not sure if one can 2h charge and ww 6 mobs at a time(in a pug group), you will likely die, gotta communicate nova with mage and he is probably to busy with casting coc the moment you try to go zerk-&gt;ww
---
Mind that stance dance will mostly burn your rage too.
---
Maybe, but most of us aren't here for some bullshit AOE spellcleave strat. I want to do the dungeons as they were intended to be done, like I did them in Vanilla.
---
If I wanted to zerg down a dungeon, I'd go play my Zandalari Troll in retail.
---
I would imagine that's fine considering they're cool with people using third party programs to multi box
---
Which is the best chat channel to find a group for Uldaman?  I've tried stormwind/ironforge/badlands without any luck.
---
If it works on 0.01% of users it was worth doing.
---
Finally, something both sides can agree on, the Alliance are spineless.
---
It’s more effective to get in a group in your 30s and punch your way through some SM runs than punching down random mobs. It’s not like you NEED spell cleave to work through SM quickly, a Rogue, Warlock, and a +1 will still shred through it with a good healer/tank. I’m your 40s mix up quests and ZF/RFD then in your 50s everyone needs loot from BRD and a full clear is like a third of a level. high 50s just spam BRD and Spires and get your pre raid BIS drops while leveling.
---
Hehe as rogue? I don’t have much luck with that. Maybe I suck. 
---
But I just had this very sucky experience that especially dawned on me, it’s how boring I will feel rogues are in Bgs.
---
Stealth to me just overall is an extremely unsatisfying mechanic. 
---
Slowing down, walking, for your opponent to then start running away unknowingly about you. In which you start to walk after him never being able to catch up, it just feels bad. 
---
and this is very noticible in group pvp.
---
I was just riding through redridge on my fresh felsteed when a gnome mage began to spam polymorph on me until it stuck for 3 seconds.  He was lvl 17...
---
My felhunter had a nice midnight snack.
---
So current Classic meta is... Guild Wars 2?
---
Powering through it is impossible with my personal mindset. Its an unhealthy perfectionism. So much so, that I could forsee that if I wouldn't have finally decided to reroll my race, I would have dropped the game entirely around 60. Simply cause I see a flawed unchangeable thing that annoys me in front of me and cant change it, at 42 the loss of progress is much more manageable than if I would have stuck with it.  
---
Not really trying to argument here, just trying to show whats behind my odd issue.
---
Omg I laughed so hard
---
Maps != Content, just ask Deadwind Pass. Mapping is the "easiest" part in terms of conceptually creating a zone. Creating quests, populating that zone with npc's, mobs, towns, maybe a dungeon or a raid, then if you have a dungeon or a raid you kinda need a storyline to explain that area, which means more quests, and if it's high level it likely has a reputation associated with it, which means a faction needs to be created, etc.
---
That's what all got cut, because it was determined late in development "oh, we can't actually finish this in time, there's too much work to be done." That means a LOT of those zones would have to be brand new content, created by the modern WoW dev teams, which everyone seems to still be dissatisfied with over Battle for Azeroth. If people don't trust the current team with modern WoW, why does anyone think they'll be better at Classic?
---
I think that just adds to the awesomeness. The sharp blue hair color and that skin tone is a good match =)
---
it's not the original code i believe. i think they had to recreate the entire game from nostalrius's original emulator, which had a lot of bugs itself that i think were carried over.
---
Ah okay, I might have misunderstood you, I basically said the same thing as you in my comment :P
---
*laughs in Warden Staff*
---
Bruh. SFK dagger, SM GY dagger, various SM quests, Gnome dagger, Outlaw sabre (if horde). All off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more. 
---
There's a trillion better options compared with using a fucking level 19 weapon until level 39. It's just bad advice.
---
If you are 44 now than imo you are behind the curve.
---
I fought a human warlock over a satyr betrayer. I killed him relatively easy with a combination of frostshock and earthshock.
---
Then he awoke again and attacked me again. I survived. But so fucking barely. I had potion on cd, 20 mana and I survived the dot only by a 60hp tick of a bandage giving me enough hp to survive with 10.
---
He later attacked me later on and feared me like 100 meters away. We then fought with 3 mobs attacking us. He killed me and barely survived. Then all the mobs aggroed him and killed him. Then he stood up again.
---
It was a fun little encounter.
---
same here, I think this is the only reason I create a lot of alts
---
You mean this?

Which is somehow less sad than "DAE Horde are a bunch of poor savages" thing Alliance put fourth in these? They always devolve into bullshit no matter what the flair.
---
is this better than POM pyro?
---
 You’re going to be using a second shield mid combat as well.
---
Preshield when running towards the next mob so the weakened soul debuff wears of faster allowing a second shield as soon as the first one wears off.
---
Are you talented 5/5 into Wands?
---
They'll get there. You were so fast that the majority are still pretty far behind and clearing BRD for 2 hours might actualy sound fun to them.
---
Once people gear up and start hating the dungeon farms they will also start clearing them faster.
---
Maybe. But it’s it’s a lot of time investment.
---
Classic wasn't a slam dunk it was a gamble and now it's a proof of concept.  Tbc isn't a gamble if classic is successful.   Thru said theyd do what the community wants but it would have to be completely overwhelmingly in favor of classic+ if it's even remotely close they'll make the smart choice and go with tbc.  I don't think it'll be close I think when the time comes more people want tbc and I think tbc will attract a while mess of people that weren't interested in classic.
---
I used the living root all the way to WW axe.... long live warrior staves!
---
Start your own groups. You will find players way faster then waiting 1-2hours looking for someone to inv you
---
10/10 would have killed you. But I'm an asshole.
---
Take a break. Classic will be around in a few months or even years and you can start a warrior if you'll feel like it then.
---
Have fun burning out, and going back to retail.
---
And it doesn't take 2 minutes to mark, pull, and CC, but I see you like hyperbole.
---
Not true at all. I play on stalagg and have ran into the same people on many occasions and recognize quite a few names. 
---
Maybe your memory just sucks.
---
Both Ironfoe and HoJ dropped for me on my first emperor kill on nostalrius. Believe it or not.
---
For Naxx specifically it’s going to be easier to have a few Druids respec to a hybrid build just to clear the Horseman. A Deep feral/tank will definitely be used to get the buff as well.
---
don't discriminate against enchanters just because they cant spell
---
I think you’re caught somewhere between semihardcore and hardcore then.  I would give that run around 1 hour myself.  
---
It sounds like you shouldn’t be pugging.  I’d just level another char while waiting for the others to level up.
---
I love feral druids. Sure, they aren't MT, but they are okay OT. And do quite well in smaller content. Just don't try and be a boomkin.
---
Tell yourself what you need to man I don’t think it’s a negative label for what it’s worth.
---
This comes down to your talent points because improved sprint helps a lot woth countering mage kiting and using vanish to escape or screw up his chance to lock you down is also massive. Your chances of winning are higher when you open with CS. 
---
   This match up is really cooldown based and if you arent lvl 60 then its probably not in your favor if youre against a player with decent decision making.
---
  If you are engi, iron grenades can make this fight harder for the mage, and force them into defensive decision making, the same goes for having the frost spell reflector trinket. Also when you force them to iceblock you need to be really anticpating the second they get out of iceblock to try to gouge/blind because that cc will travel with them when they blink or if you timed it well you will keep them in place.
---
   I really feel like the goal as a rogue in this match up is to avoid giving them a moment to poly and try your very best to use your cooldowns to stay on top of them. You also need to realize when you are losing to him kiting you there is nothing wrong with running the opposite direction to drop combat and heal, or even get a stealth as sometimes mages will over estimate their effective range.
---
As you can see there is a lot to talk about with this matchup and im not some pvp professional. This is a fun fight though when you figure out what works for you.
---
Not the entire thing no, but it was my understanding that they took bits and pieces of the original, current and some of nostalrius's codes to get what we have today. I could be entire wrong about that though
---
So stop pugging and make some equally skilled, to your esteemed determination, friends?
---
Don't complain about getting muddy if you're wallowing with the pigs.
---
3 charges, yes.
---
Disagree. I even think that BGs should have never existed. I like them and do them a lot dont get me wrong. But i think wow is a better game without them. IMO
---
Found it at Ikea (49,20), dont forget to loot extra screws trust me u need them!
---
How FUCKING dare you
---
Not anymore buddy. 
---
You will need to find utterly terrible opponents for world of rogue craft to be a viable way of playing. 
---
People are good today, they know how to counter a rogue, they don’t let you do that shit. 
---
Rogues are for sure hard to master, and you need to be VERY good to win over decent players who know how to counter you. Or you can be a nightmare against cloth wearers who don’t know how to play.
---
And I don’t like ganking noobs.
---
It do be like that
---
Unfortunately it has been getting worse and worse since release. Completely garbage subreddit, literally the worst one I'm subbed to atm.
---
your search pentameter isn't particularly good.
---
WoW classic quest, +quest name got it just fine
---
Shut up, it's not that hard.
---
/lookingforgroup is pretty active
---
yes.  on characters like druid and warlock I run out of space 
---
note: not all are used in combat, some are just handy when resting etc.
---
note 2:   I could clean it up more by making macros that let you cast different spells on pressing shift alt or control and a key, but I am too lazy for that sort of fancy stuff
---
Ravenger lol
---
That was especially the one that made me hate the class. It makes me feel so weak.
---
It's fucking awful. I got downvoted like crazy saying this earlier. One warrior needs to go in d stance and swap stances to keep aggro. When all 5 people are tanking a mob there's no real cleave and everyone is low and AoE healing is a bitch on mana.
---
I kept getting told "well then you had a bad group" no shit I had a bad group, you don't go to LFG or world chat to get a guild only group made up of BIS warriors in voice chat.
---
Regen m80
---
You're almost halfway to 60!
---
On Pservers most guilds has a few hybrid specs that were just tanky enough to tank the Horseman and one deep Feral tank/dps. they got a spell hit trinket to use on that fight and could do their primary roll outside of that fight.
---
Interface Options &gt; Social &gt; Block Chat Channel Invites (?)
---
Who cares? I never notice until you nerds complain. Shut up already.
---
Eh, I wasn’t amused, I do like Punkrat from YouTube’s picture of Donald Trump as a blood elf and found that one funny cuz he is orange like they can be and is rich and snobby.
---
However he lacks the elegance of the blood elves while encapsulating their negative qualities.
---
I don’t hate trump but I don’t like him either.
---
Better than Silithid Pox in Un'Goro
---
Thanks for your reply! I don't see myself raiding at 60 due to my schedule, so I'm starting to change my mind about picking up LW after all. I'll look up the recipes though and see if there's anything else that I could farm. Ty :D
---
Came here for the comments, also interested.
---
Yes. But both T1&amp; 2 is it’s all the awesome elemental energy translates into healing. That’s just wrong
---
Aimed Shot will change that
---
The problem definitely stems from the players on this one. People are clearing, yes that's right, CLEARING Molten Core with 40 people with many not even 60 yet. And plenty of 'off-meta' healing / tanking / DPS specs. 
---
That's right, all these specs are viable. Play balance druid if you want! It's graphs like these and toxic minmaxers that discourage folks from playing how they want. Unless you're in a hardcore guild that's already cleared MC, your spec does not matter. Play what's most fun. Don't change what you wanna do because of some dumb chart like this one. I don't even know anyone with a full time job who's level 50 yet lol. These players are the hardest of the hardcore. Please please don't let them define the experience for the rest of us.
---
This is why I don’t mind google tracking my every move or another app on my phone doing the same. “Dear police officer, it couldn’t have been me! Just look at this Pokémon I caught at the same time on the other side of town. Or look at this app I use to track my step, it says I was here then, or look at how google asked me to review this Starbucks an hour away from the crime scene. I also took the cool picture of a few ducks crossing the road at the same time the shooting happen and the geotag shows I wasn’t there.”
---
After the early game, many of the crafting professions except for alchemy become useless. 
---
Optimal strat is to level an alt to 35 and teach it crafting professions. That way you can put other profs on your main, like engineer, and still make money from crafting cooldowns.
---
\-Feral druid

\-use it for the raw damage

oh my poor child, you have much to learn

Alright, I see your point. Long day, I definitely misinterpreted your post.

No you won't miss out on items. You'll probably have better items a lot of times.
---
Also it is optimal with pretty much any comp if you are decent at the game.

In a pug, you will likely die alot with 2h tanking. Or use pot on cd. It wont happen.

Are you sure you are a rogue and not a Wizard

Pardon the delayed laughter, it all kinda hit me when I finally looked at his health bar and realized how lucky he was.
---
With what you have and your present need to get a mount, maybe keep skinning until you secure your mount, then drop skinning for alchemy.  Alchemy will always be useful.  Engineering is the best for PvP, but it would be hard for you to pick it up at your current point.
---
The IP address doesn’t matter you can get a VPN or a proxy chain and mask your IP. If you’re going to be a malicious hacker I’d hope you have brains enough to have both.

True. A few areas would need to be adjusted for a lack of flying, but to my memory there aren't many compared to, say, Wrath.
---
can you use while in stealth?
---
Welcome to the high demand tank-life brother! I get multiple dms every time i log about joining, but sometimes u just want to pug or quest. The problem here is how u react to people who're upset u didnt invite them. U can simply reply: 'Sry bro missed ja, next run u in!', 'This is just a quick dungeongroup in helping we'll play next time'.
---
POWER TO THE FORSAKEN!
---
Maximizing your effectiveness means weaving in Arcane Shot when there's mana for it.
---
As a Beast Master this is constantly because it essentially replaces Aimed Shot in your rotation until 50+.
---
Multishot is and always will be a conditional ability you use when you *can*. Unless you want to be the dick who steals aggro from adds and breaks CC.
---
It's clear at this point you're an absolute moron, so please do feel free to fuck your tail between your legs instead of alienating even more people. Your karma score speaks for itself. Loser.
---
I went 21/30/0 so I can Intimidation + FD trap people rather than scatter shot FD trapping and having the trap last half as long due to DR. 
---
You can also get your Engineering to 175 for Iron Grenades and 20 for Death Ray to nuke people in your deadzone.
---
I’m a 46 mage right now and whenever I ask in LFG to join a dungeon it’s always got at least one more mage and it’s a “speed/aoe/zerg/farm/“ group. I just wanna play the game and have fun in dungeons. I picked a mage because they have portals and make tasty food ):
---
What makes a good hunter?
---
You can't mount in combat
---
holy hell!
---
Ugh, I can still remember how much time I wasted spamming trade trying to give away crappy +1 enchants before someone told me I could just enchant the same item over and over again.
---
Lol LOIC FTW.
---
This is great
---
It's a felony in the United States, there's no equivalent charge in many jurisdictions.

Hey now, all the jawless undead have to come from somewhere, and you wouldn't want to embarrass yourself by bringing skulls without jawbones to the deathguard, would you?
---
lmaooo why would anyone even do this? what a dick
---
I’m excited to have this new tool in my pocket. I never played a lock in vanilla so I’m a noob. Good stuff.
---
use pet on passive during dungeons near your level
---
As a Gnome, I find orcs the most toxic. Only undead rogues are kinda toxic. But us Gnomies are the best and most respectful for sure.
---
obviously no and this is just silly to suggest
---
Cringe
---
I cant believe no1 made this before
---
I was farming some toxic horrors and this night elf Hunter thought she could just join on in. 4 deaths before she realized it wasn’t a fight she can win. Even when she got the jump on me.
---
Worse yet wasthe 60 mage, 3 levels higher than me, who sheeped me and still managed to lose both fights.
---
I guess shadow priests really are nuts in world PvP.
---
No gnomes are the worst on ally.
---
Yes. Tor users get caught all the time. There’s more to using TOR properly then just installing and using it.  The government is frequently identifying zero days in the onion router and exploiting them to track users.
---
I know where it is. Just happens to be real easy to take a pic and upload from my phone.  Kinda weird it bothers you that much to be honest
---
I totally feel like that right now.
---
I remember the devs saying that they try not to layer hop and players unless grouping etc causes it. That way you could possibly still recognize some players from other zones as you progress (I guess assuming you never group?). Its weird but based on their comment, I don’t think so unless there’s some bug. It’s not their intention to swap you when solo constantly.
---
Lulz
---
I've had the opposite issue, people rush into combat so I have to rebuff stamp in the middle of combat and try to save mana doing that.
---
Imagine nuking your own city to take care of level 25 troggs
---
I remember G4 having a bit talking about this questline and the rare cat vendor in storm wind back in 2004

that /played though

Not a problem! :)  
---
So i'm a BIG fan of Imp Overpower. Until you get Whirlwind and Mortal Strike it's your only source of instant damage. At 5 rage it's by FAR the most efficient damage per rage you have (or will ever get) so it's important you use it every single time its available.
---
Stacking Impale (+20% Crit damage) with Deepwounds (+60% crit damage over 12 sec) with Imp Overpower (+50% Crit chance) pulls very impressive damage.  
---
If you have a half decent weapon and land an overpower crit from half health on many same level mobs you can often just hit them with a hamstring and kite them and the bleed will finish them off.
---
There's no saying you should NOT get imp charge over something else but i would not sacrifice improved overpower (personally).  
---
If you wanted to get imp charge i would skil 2 points on 2h wep spec and go something like:  
---
3/3 Rend, 2/5 Deflection  
---
5/5 Tactical Mastery
---
1/1 Anger Management, 3/3 Deep wounds, 1/2 Imp Overpower  
---
2/2 Impale, 2/2 Imp Overpower, 2/2 Imp Charge  
---
then sweeping, axe spec, Imp hamstring or 2h wep spec and get Mortal Strike and 5/5 cruelty asap.  
---
It IS nice to be nice! it's the classic way!
---
Yea, I think it was more for people looking for more of a challenge, but the average player was a lot worse back then so a knowledgable lvl 10 could actually outplay other people. I think rogues and warriors were the only ones that could do lvl 10 effectively though
---
I hit lvl 30 on my rogue last night, which is my main (im taking it slow) and i feel like im rediculiously op. Just remeber to follow tallent guides and skill rotations and always pick up higher damage items when you can. 75% of rogue damage comes from white damage, so slice and dice with blade fury and you will be a damage powerhouse. I like combat because i like going head on, but using a stealth garrote then followed up with ss , slice and dice with 2-3 combat points and then ss and evicerate, ill barely lose 25% health before same level mobs die.
---
Another thing i see allot is people failing to apply poisons. Instant poison  as well as your other various cc and utility poisons can turn a rogue frok okay to just downright unbeatable.  Dont chase enemies in pvp, you want to stalk and ambush them on your terms. Not theirs.
---
Most likely (base + flat mod) * percentage mods
---
Just use Wowhead?
---
True, but I've never seen any showers in Stormwind and the canal is also a sewer so... Yeah, probably smells like the Ganges.
---
Is that a bat?
---
for pve the wolf is better anyway. broken thooth is a pvp pet
---
Er you realise they work out the exact same right? At any rate, think of the % total damage talents that are flat increases calculated after everything else, so (crit/crush/armour/block) * 1.05
---
God that makes me want to pvp as arms, my god.
---
Yeah I think SM is when things really start to hurt your leather gear
---
There's no cooldown on transmuting essences? TIL.
---
Their "9000 lawyers" aren't prosecutors.  They don't get to decide who stands trial, and for what, nor do they determine what punishment they receive.  Moreover, nobody knows where this guy lives; he could live somewhere far out of the jurisdiction of these "9000 lawyers".
---
Assuming he lives in the United States though, even then, while their "9000 lawyers" might take him to civil court to attempt to reclaim damages, I think it's unlikely.  It's doubtful that he has any assets to seize, nor can they seize *future* assets, and the cost of attempting to do so (after all, they have 9000 lawyers, they don't work for free, right?) would outweigh the potential funds they'd reclaim, so that's not going to happen.
---
Thanks for your eminently unqualified legal opinion though, it's good to know that the average citizen knows fucking squat about how the legal systems of the world work.
---
Yeah crypto was never as untraceable as people thought. The whole purpose of a blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions stored in multiple locations used to verify one another before adding more blocks. Therefore it’s pretty easy to identify where coins are going and what wallets they have been in.

Hey everyone, wanted to ask what's the etiquette about the locked chests in dungeons? I'm a rogue and lvled up my lockpicking. This took some time away from my lvling and consider that this work deserve some reward. But the teams in dungeons take it for granted and just /roll for the chest and wait for me to open it.
---
I don't want to be the ashole player so I force myself to roll with it. How do you feel about it? What do people usually do on your server?

Thanks =)

You've essentially proved the same equation.

I checked a bit further and maybe there is a way.

I checked the [wowead page of soothsaying for dummies](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=177226/book-soothsaying-for-dummies) and found this post from a few days ago:
---
Can confirm it works in WoW Classic!
---
Here is what i did:
---
1. I went Engineering till 240 including Gnomish-Enginerring to build the Items i want.  
---
2. Unlearned Engineering altogether (Press C then Skills then the Profession u want to unlearn then the red thing)  
---
3. Reskill your Profession too 200 (not sure about that, i did 225 just in case)  
---
4. Optional: Delete your member-pass (again not sure, i just forgot about it and deleted it when i was 225)  
---
5. Go to Steamwheedle, Tanaris (rouhgly 65,18) (https://classic.wowhead.com/?npc=11811))  
---
6. Click on the book that is on the table. Now you can change your Specialization! Image: (sorry it's in german) imgur.com/a/F3Voynr
---
I didn’t notice that at first but now I can’t stop looking!
---
What??
---
A founding principle behind classic wow, and indeed many MMOs of its time, is that the only way to get money ingame was to earn it.
---
Any method of wealth redistribution from non-classic related activities being allowed and/or endorsed would fundamentally deal a blow to the type of game Classic is trying to be.
---
That's a resounding no from me.
---
Merci
---
What is the best level to start SM farming?
---
Small price to pay to get shitty people out of your life lol
---
Probably didn’t even create the botnet himself, probs bought it to show off to some friends.
---
Playing alliance :/
---
please continue, satan.
---
You only need 300 tailor for the 2% crit bonus on bloodvine. It's kind of only worth it for warlocks since they have to wear bloodvine much more than mages do. Mages have many more options to reach hit cap, warlocks do not.
---
turn that shit off and guess based on vague language in the quest like the rest of us!
---
You mainly farm it for XP And gold pepega
---
That sounds like nonsense. They’d just move his character.
---
As a prior mage main, just wait, youre not that strong.
---
Yeah it depends on your level (and then once you hit 60) your gear. By far the fastest runs of UBRS/strat/scholo/Dire maul you can do are with a geared fury warrior tanking in zerker stance. BRD is great for aoe tanking once you have a weapon chain.  
---
Like I said, if you're unlevelled (or undergeared at 60), it's a bad idea.
---
10 years? Ha, maybe in 'murica, where everytimg is big.
---
Priest if you plan on raiding, you can never have enough dwarf priests.
---
Otherwise I'd go for hunter, no question. Amazing class, and don't worry about it being popular - once you get to level ten, get your pet, you'll forget all about that. It's an incredibly fun class, an experience that shouldn't be missed.
---
As for "must-do" things for Alliance, Deadmines! Do *all* the dungeon quests, including the infamous messenger and escort quest. You haven't lived alliance life until you've been massacred by Defias Pillagers :P Plus the rewards for taking VanCleef's head are amazing, I've seen leather wearers keep the chest piece up to level 40. Deadmines is our version of The Barrens - everyone's done it, everyone loves it, and it's where players from all early zones gather up and make proper connections for the first time. Plus it's just an amazing dungeon.
---
Other things to do... Duskwood is generally agreed on as one of the best zones lore-wise in the game, so if you're into reading quest texts, go for that. Also when you're level 10 do the Wetlands Death Run and take your dwarf to Darnassus. 
---
And why not take a trip around Stonetalon? Not a whole lot of quests there (some start in Ashenvale) but it might be fun to see a horde-dominated zone from an Alliance perspective. 
---
I might remember more later on.
---
As a lock, the only classes I don't like fighting 1v1 is other locks and pallys
---
I totally understand that, but even if they didn't inflate the numbers, simply costing a company some money should NOT result in someone spending a massive chunk of their life in prison. Yes, DDoSing is wrong, but it's the type of crime that's ultimately forgivable, you know what I mean? It's nowhere near as bad as crimes like murder, assault, or rape, where people actually get hurt.
---
Like, DDoSing a company isn't going to ruin anyone's life, therefore, it's unfair for you to have *your* life ruined in return. Simple eye for an eye concept...
---
Takes something like this to remind you some
---
absolute weirdos play this game.
---
For some reason Undead Warlocks have been among the chillest. Female Tauren and Orcs though… they're just psychos
---
Not even lazy just non existent opsec
---
YAR YAR HUMP HUMP
---
There still are a lot, are you dyslexic?
---
Stacking mages for aoe was 100% the norm in vanilla, why did you except things to change this time around? You think people would intentionally play suboptimal for nostalgia?
---
On ten storms (one of the medium servers. So it might not be representable) the bubble has been topping at 20 for the last couple of weeks. The only change that has happened is that it flattens more out. Right now this means that late thirties/early forties is around where it starts to get difficult to find groups for dungeons.
---
I ask if anyone else has keys (blacksmithing) or can otherwise open it (other rogues). If not, I take it. Hasn't been an issue yet.
---
Go wave yourself
---
“Ddos attack via dark net” lol wtf are you on about 😂
---
If I didn't look at the numbers, I didn't even think I played that much.
---
Put a fun emote or a buff on the place of that macro :D
---
It’s a Chance on hit so no guarantees the squak happens,
---
Fuckin shit is he not American?
---
You can out heal most damage but you can't out heal retardation if you can't keep someone alive but no issues with everyone else it might not be you
---
Less than killing people in the US.
---
Live to win
---
The bigger the hit the bigger the chance to break if I recall?
---
So dots hardly break it and you'll just run round and die, but shit like shadow bolt will 100% knock it off.
---
It just sounds like you are playing the wrong class for what you want,  just re-roll if that's how you feel, it's just a game after all...nothing lost except time.
---
For pvp Spriests are pretty fun and so are locks,  shamans are aparrently pretty great in classic as well If you are horde, but  from what I've heard, warriors are pretty underwhelming, And druids pallies are just walking buff machines at endgame. Hunters are hunters...if you like that kind of thing. 
---
If that doesnt make you happy, then maybe classic isn't your game for pvp, it isn't everyone's.  As my name suggest i like pvp in Dota 2, but i couldn't care less about pvp in wow, so i just don't play other than pve.
---
It's a joke..
---
God damn.
---
They were on the phone!
---
Im so glad I rolled an RP PVP server. These turn out so good.
---
Still a joke
---
It's nice isn't it? Enjoy the ride!
---
The point is, if it sounds like whining to me, it will sound like whining to many others. And this is why they respond with "pvp happened". Might want to add "Anyone wanna team up and take him on?" or just "Help please!" in there. Nothing wrong in this, it just sounds like whine and will be reacted to as whine.
---
Hope you enjoy half of the server having you on ignore
---
Thanks for the serious response dog that's good advice i probably tend to over explain myself lmao
---
All I know is Bernie isn't taking my silver.
---
Awesome!
---
thank you for that. Yeah, I do plan on grinding some skinnable mobs for mount money (forgot about that tbh) so I think I can hold off :D
---
Never did get to 60 before tbc, so that'll be new!
---
Did you happen to go to the barrens today in blaumeux?
---
Does not reset it.  Moves you to front of dungeon.  You reset it when you reload and you're outside of it.  Still all the regular limitations. It just means you're not running, nor are you dying then graveyard running.
---
You roll for it. Ask yourself this if there's an enchanter in your group does he charge you to shard vendor trash or do they just do it and have everyone roll for the shards, they worked just as hard if not harder leveling enchanting then you did leveling lock boxes. If you wouldn't feel comfortable paying an enchanter to shard the trash drops you shouldn't be asking the group to pay you to open chests.
---
In a patchwerk situation you'd maybe get a small DPS boost because of the more consistent uptime of frenzy, but as it lasts 8 seconds anyway I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes or if its worth it to only set 4 points in it. Probably not much and you'll want a wolf for instanced PvE anyway as furious howl helps a lot, specially as it's usable if you have to put your pet on passive so it doesn't die to mechanics.
---
This is so gonna be me.
---
as cowardly rogue you should be feared by default...
---
You gotta ask yourself what was this guys thought process here. What was his endgame?
---
Few mins of annoying people on the internet for giggles resulting potential jail time. Do people not think things through anymore
---
Nesingwary camp is an excellent choice aswell
---
They're objectively by far the overall best class in the game.
---
All you need is Imp Blizzard and a NovaBlink macro if you have slow fingers and you immediately become actually game-breaking.
---
The best utility of any Damage class.
---
The best AoE of any Damage class.
---
The best CC of any Damage class.
---
The best solo farming of any class. 
---
The best group farming of any class.
---
The best leveling speed of any class.
---
The second best world PvP of any class
---
The only things they aren't the best at is Flag Carrying in BGs and tanking/healing because they straightup can't do that.
---
Mage is strong af.

they just posted about it

Glimmering  mithril insignia, or something like that, you need to be a blacksmith though
---
Yikes indeed.
---
No way. They are two separate games, don't ruin classic.
---
&gt;If you have a method to open the chest because you worked for that method then it's yours.

So your fine with enchanters charging you to shard vendor trash then?

Id like the game to have the same graphics as retail.
---
top
---
At least in retail it works fine to have multiple instances of WoW running with an own account each. 
---
You can Alt-Tab between them like regular programs, and always control only one of those. Since graphic settings are global you can 't go fullscreen on two different monitors IIRC.

That just makes it worse in the "what were you thinking?" -department. Asmongold is like a human version of an unwashed angry Muppet. I'm convinced that he's popular, because kids graduate from watching cartoons to watching him.
---
You can purchase bot nets there to do the attack for you. It's rather cheap.
---
I mean sure standing in town is not very efficient.
---
Personally for me, I'd rather sit in town than actually quest because I hate questing. But I'm also sucking it up to get to 60 asap.
---
Me n the boys getting back together.
---
whatever is fastest! seal of righteousness bonus damage is not based on weapon speed so the faster the better.
---
I was in a cave yesterday (as Horde) surrounded by pesky alliance. The tension was quite high, but noone was attacking. Then a level 51 hunter wrote something that translatet to "mod". Safe to say I was out of there in seconds.
---
But won't he get a fine for the potential lost revenue of Blizzard and whatever else he ddos'd?
---
Well you can thank the draconian laws that are CFAA. (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)
---
one man should not have this much power
---
The alliance suck. Mage I’m looking at you
---
Don't level it, just leave as it is. Or DE only Soulbound items from quests.
---
I think like only 1/8 pieces actually have hit rating
---
Better their class icons on crotch level and water on their face and mage icon on her crotch
---
There's not really a concept of 'anti ddos' unfortunately. The fact is, when you send a packet to a server somebody has to process it, even if it's to say "Nope sorry, your packet is nonsensical", hence that's going to use some systems resources to process.
---
There are services out there which will tell thousands of systems to send traffic to a particular IP address. Blizzard can likely handle gigabits worth of traffic, however even large corporations have their limits.
---
You often see DDOS protection services out there, but in essence all they do is inspect packets before they hit your platform and will simply drop them if they aren't valid. That being said, if your DDOS was big enough there's nothing to say you wouldn't take out the DDOS protection platform.
---
DDOS is more so a flaw with the internet in general, and unfortunately the best thing you can do against it is simply police it. Hell, I have setup a few networks for some small businesses that use DSL lines. I have fibre at home, if I wanted to I could write 3 line script that would take down their website right now without the need for bot nets.
---
Hello fellow warrior! It feels so good that you want to bring your warrior to the next level. After overpower you want all kinds of macros to make your warrior an absolute beast. Loving it that you put it on your scroll wheel. What is mouse wheel down?
---
You could also do sweeping strikes scroll up and whirlwind scroll down. Or overpower scroll up and execute scroll down. 
---
Press enter and type /macro.
---
There you can copy paste:
---
#showtooltip overpower
---
/Cast Battle stance
---
/Cast Overpower
---
Well done. Now you can expand to a battle stance charge macro, and berserker stance intercept macro, a berserker stance berserker rage macro, a berserker stance whirlwind macro, a defensive stance shield macro.
---
Go even further:
---
/Dismount
---
/cast Charge
---
Goodluck!
---
It's not that bad if you have a main to buy good weapons, they shouldn't be too expensive right now. 
---
I was dreading it too at first but good weapons and first aid really make the difference !
---
Yeah i guess people feel like im.gonna be their tank if i do runs with them a few days in a row so probably just gonna not do that for people i Don't know well. Thans for the tip.
---
IIRC it should work with druids in form
---
You can just type /Rl to reload, save you a couple seconds
---
Do you mean having them disenchant gear I give them and then having them give the mats back to me?
---
Sure that sounds like a service you can ask for payment for. 
---
Just like how it's possible for someone to ask for payment if you give them liferoot and want a greater healing potion. They worked for the profession they have to be able to do that, they deserve payment for that work.
---
Why would you bit a kazoo?
---
Pretty cool. Can you recommend a beads-set or something to get started? Would be awesome!
---
It's allowed by Blizzard rules but at your own risk.
---
Yeah that's the move lol they were cool at first its just weird now
---
You mean Alliance right?
---
All at 60
---
As soon as the boat leaves the docks you can attack and kill someone, but if they don't release, they will be revived on the boat when you load to the other side, So I get to kill people twice
---
Like when you put a group together in Classic and people drop group at the end without a word. Always takes me back to Retail.
---
I wouldn't cancel but I still like it when I got center
---
a lot of people re-spec to Arms at 40 to get Mortal Strike, once you get MS, arms it's the best for leveling.  
---
I wouldn't respec from now till you're 60 depending on what you plan on doing (tanking, PvPing, raid DPS etc).
---
F.

Just wanna add here for some weird reason King Bangalash does not own the Cobra reflexes passive :/ so not entirely the same

So i can't dual monitor 2 accounts at once?

You are basically asking "who cares about quality?".

It's sad that quality isn't even cared about with posts. It's so low effort it's insane.

I wanted to downvote this because it hurts. :(
---
Hey fam get with your people and let em know not to roll on melee weapons and trinkets that have on-swing effects and you'll get invited to groups more often 🙍
---
No I mean a boss drops an item noone wants so instead of everyone greed rolling and the winner vendoring it for 1g the enchanter takes the item and disenchants it into a shard worth 3-5g that everyone then rolls on. And no noone ever charges for this for the record.
---
I keep seeing this but I don't really remember that being the case at all.

So what country is Meta?

oh boy tought it was unsuccessful because there was a frame without him being your pet after the tame need a new mouse now i suppose
---
Heck.. I should have thought of that.
---
Cats are good damage but not tanky. You could try a Plagued Swine. Carrion birds might be good too, but you'd have to level one.
---
Dagger rogue is only ~10% worse when both have optimal gear. Currently it just makes the most to gear some dagger rogues since weapons are in short supply.
---
This is a copy/pasted answer from Wowwiki. Ignore the specific examples.
---
Its not about being 50+ or the fact that its BRD.
---
Its the fact that if a 55 2h weapon drops and there are two warriors, a level 55 and level 54, the 54 does NOT get to roll need.
---
Horry shiet
---
I love this shit. Ganking is probably my favorite part about Classic, but so many players (including those in my guild) are against it which is a shame. Being able to clear a map of the enemy almost can have a great benefit to your group as far as farming goes but it also invites some awesome PVP because reinforcements usually come in eventually who know what they are doing. 
---
Keep up the good fight,comrade. For the Alliance!
---
Scare beast definitely works on druids while they are in bear, cat or travel form
---
If you play in windowed mode, you can put the window wherever you want it to. Just fullscreen and boderless window doesn't work here (since you can't drag them).
---
Also, I'd recommend to cap your background FPS if you have an older graphics card.
---
Sending you a message.

I almost completely disagree with everything you said in this topic. But you are right there, there should not be any cc for a 3mob pack with that group..

Also mostly not....

I am going on a trip and I want a cheapo laptop to play WoW Classic on.

Would something like this work ok, or should I go with something else?

Yeah i only pick fights if you fuck with others on my side (or myself, obviously).
---
Or Undead rogues. Undead rogues must have done something to deserve it
---
If you gibe them tjis qs an example they will just say that this was widely known in his guild and others are just plebs
---
don't the Bats from ZG beat Brokentooth in DPS? They also have 1,0 attackspeed IIRC
---
The worst is when you're tanking and the druid gives thorns to everyone, including the Earth Shock-happy shaman who also has lightning shield and rockbiter up for some goddamn reason.
---
Why on Earth would they do that? Ashbringer seems a really chill server tbf
---
I’m not classist, I have a warlock friend.

There were 16 level 60s in un'goro at 2 am on my server on a wednesday night.
---
Lol, WoW
---
Still sounds like a bannable exploit to me. I doubt they would go through the trouble of actually doing it tho.
---
You're a legend thank you so much!
---
Pretty sure, yes
---
Depends on the country, in many countries IP address is not proof of identification. Proving someone did a ddos attack is hard, so he might be released.
---
TBH dude that’s why we made the full premade alt levelling group - quick and easy dungeon runs when we fancy a spam
---
Shadow priests excel in PvP. But In PvE you will most likely be last pic for dps.
---
Mage is best all around class imo
---
Thankfully there are actually usable public access flight masters in Moonglade. The alliance one is South of the town and the horde one is nearby the furbolg tunnel
---
Because it wasnt.
---
I got killed by a group of lvl 45ish players in Badlands when I first hit 60, figured I'd go assert my dominance and have some fun, ran into a 5 man group who instead of most people (running and trying to get away) they all just turned it on me, wasn't even close I got destroyed.
---
Friendly reminder that fear breaking is RNG based on how hard does the tick of damage hits rather than a set number of damage.
---
If the Warlock is lucky Fear will last the whole duration with all dots up, if the warlock is super-unlucky it breakd on the first dot tick... XD
---
First one (pink)
---
Let's burn one big tree instead
---
Lol if you're insinuating that paladins are a joke in classic, you really don't understand the game mechanics all that well.
---
I'm a mage, not a warlock! Or do we all just look the same to you? 😤
---
Thats what you get for choosing the wrong side ;)
---
fucking boo, I looked for those guys for like half an hour and couldn't find them anywhere, just went and used the normal flight master

Shadow Priest is necessary for Shadow Weaving to pump up Warlock's damage in raids.  So most raids have at least one Shadow Priest. Also, shadow priest damage is decent if played right.

Priest is an absolute dream to level, especially with spirit-tap and wanding. Check out Tipsout's priest deep dive with Lezonta. He explains it in detail.

Tbh I think it's more successful than blizzard ever imagined but in 6 months a large percentage of these people will be gone.  3 weeks is nothing
---
By 40s every class is good
---
But generally rogues have a shit item pool available and no self heal
---
Minimal aoe too
---
The specials are nice but too situational cuz of cooldowns. Not something you really bet on.
---
Meanwhile warriors got plenty of item upgrades to choose and easily get into dungeons for more loot making leveling smooth.
---
Go for a faster leveling class? Hunter or druid?
---
In PvE - why do you awnt to play priest if you don't want to heal? There are warlock and mage too which are very efficient DDs. Also, Healing isn't that hard in classic at all.
---
Their damage is fine, but it relies on a spell which generates extra threat. Also, you'll burn through your mana in absolutely no time.
---
Vanilla all day long. If they go the expansion route again... well, at least i had a blast for a while.
---
exactly the opposite
---
Loot cost dkp, you spend dkp if you win the roll. If you dont have enough, you shouldnt have even rolled
---
Well, 3 when in a group. And then 4 when you get to the bottom of the affliction tree. Your mana, your health, the healers mana, and your demons mana.
---
If that homo got mad then it was all worth it.
---
Spriest is probably worse in dungeons than in raids lol. They're fine for solo and pve and pvp though
---
And what about his wife?
---
I think I made my point poorly. I’m more advocating/saying that it isn’t doom and gloom if you don’t kill every mob along the way. If you hit a dry spot there’s definitely a dungeon along the way that has XP and Gear waiting to be plundered.
---
Personally if there was a dungeon with some sick drops in it and I was hitting a tough wall in quests I punched out some dungeons, and the gear and extra level or two made the quests doable and I still am exploring the world
---
Its probably only listed for so high because of the fire resistance
---
Yep same here. I mean, we knew what was coming but I still hope at some point classes get a talent balancing pass that gives hybrid DPS a reason to exist other than bringing utility that for some reason isn't already covered by a heal specced version of your class.
---
It really would be interesting if boomkins, prot pala or enhance for example get their meme stigma removed.
---
The wrath&gt; version is better designed (breaks at X-percent). This one is more unreliable for both parties. Sometimes it does nothing breaks on the first DoT tick, sometimes it lasts fuckin 20 seconds.
---
No, they're not.
---
I'm 31 and just tanked graveyard pretty well
---
how do you monitor blessings?
---
There are chain quests tied to dungeons that open up some good items. Crescent Staff comes to mind for WC. Seal of Sylvanis for warriors in SFK. Sure some good drops are blue. But some of the best dungeon items are tied to quests. Some of the top tier items in the game are also from lengthy chain quests. 
---
So yeah, you will absolutely miss out on great items.
---
A fine?  No.  Fines are punitive measures imposed by the courts, not financial recompensation.
---
Blizzard's lawyers COULD attempt to sue him, but there are a lot of really big "what ifs" there; if he doesn't live inside US jurisdiction, a US-based company isn't going to be able to sue him.  If he has no assets to seize, then they're not going to get any money out of him, and if he doesn't have any money, then they'll spend more on their legal team than they would hope to recover, so it's pointless.
---
Please Blizzard don't go that route again. The game finally is here again and it would break my heart if any expansions would follow.
---
I prefer Vanilla.

Cute.

This is the reason no one wanted the right click ban crap, I remember Angwe back in the day ganking on wetlands for months next to the boat, never got banned.

---
That is just incorrect. Britain and the US have extremely little in common except for a language. The culture is different, architecture, the history, the politics and infrastructure. There are more Irish and or Italians in the US that British people.
---
I mean we're called The HORDE for a reason.

Nice, thanks!

I am comparing vanilla dungeons with its retail equivalent. So vanilla deadmine vs retail deadmines for example. Not mythic + deadmines.
---
And even then i never found mythic + particulary difficult. Except if difficult mean "you can't alt-tab in battle"
---
There is an option to select monitor in the graphics settings so you should be able to play in fullscreen on both monitors. 
---
Usually playing on two monitors and switching between them from time to time, haven't tried running one instance on each monitor though. 
---
I have however played two accounts at the same monitor at the same time. Make sure you cap the background fps to keep your gpu cool and happy! :)
---
(I can run two instances of wow without capping fps, using a 1060 6GB, i prefer to cap it though since im on a laptop.)

Funnily enough the few times I tried all mage DPS it sucked ass. They can't actually kite to save their lives and the entire group except me (warrior) has to sit down and drink from their sippy cups for nearly a full minute every pull. If I pull more than usual we just die because it's too much for me to tank and as said the mages can never kite for shit. I'd rather do an all warrior party, we can just steamroll dungeons without a tank with only one healer.
---
All mage only works if every mage knows what they're doing. Otherwise it's actually slower than anything else.
---
I use the addon bartender4, it allows you to customize your actionbar
---
I’ve done multiple deadmines and stockade runs.
---
I’ve looked at questie for all those zones I mentioned and it’s all just higher leveled elites left.
---
I’m at shimmering flats now.
---
Thanks a lot mate
---
Yeah sure buddy. They didn’t know how classic would do. You know better than blizzard. What an arrogant blowhard you are.
---
Ive been leveling at Sub, level 54 now, 32 Sub, 11 Assassination, going rest into combat. I open with daggers and gank with daggers, but I still switch to swords to use hemo,
---
Thanks.

---

---
Are you actually stupid?   They had like 7 servers at release lol.  Blocked bye
---
How did you hit them ?
---
With RES or on the app there's no extra step. Can't speak for everyone, but for some reason reddit images load way slower than Imgur ones for me, at least on desktop. It's not a big deal either way though.
---
I just hide all my bound buttons so i cant cheat and click them. Makes muscle memory form much faster!
---
In a fair duel and a similar skill level a warrior clearly has an advantage. When you're surrounded by mobs and like at 30% hp however...
---
“May” is the new Never.
---
I love players like this so much. They're so rare nowadays, even in classic.
---
I lvl priest also. Pre-sheild and go for longer shadow word pain talent. Also important: Don't forget to use primal scream. I could solo any elite mob by just applying SW:P and fearing. It takes some time for the elite to die though.
---
Another option is to clear enemies so that that doesn't happen.
---
i don't think undead can breath, so can you even inhale in the first place?
---
Imp is for the stam buff and is pretty much the default. Voidwalker is to tank bosses if you aren't running with an actual tank. Succ basically shouldn't be used in groups unless you have another lock, in which case she's fine since the different imps blood pact buffs don't stack and she has good dps. Felhunter is if you need to dispel magic or silence things.
---
For solo play I primarily use the succ since she gives me extra cc for if a group of alliance roll up on me.
---
Until you get a shadow reflector and you get the warlock death coil himself. Both effective and will 100% make your day brighter and better!
---
I like that. Gonna have to come up with something good
---
Keep posting it screw that guy
---
oh, i must have not read the thing properly (typical XD)
---
I thought people levelled as arms and then re-specc'd to fury not vice versa
---
As im in arms already i'll just stick with it - thank you for your time :)
---
Hunter in open area is better, locks don't have any instants that can proc daze on Cheetah IIRC.
---
I'd say keep going with goblin, the advantage you will get is being able to be self-sufficient with the goblin sapper charges (and goblin mortar). The crit in this clip was incredibly lucky and rarely happens, not worth a profession reset for you :)
---
Anybody can ddos, the bar to entry is incredibly low.

Hello guys. I'm currently playing Rogue and I was wondering what are the best professions for a Rogue? I've watched Payo, because I know he's a Rogue main and he's using Mining + Engineering, so I picked the same. Not yet lv 150 in any, but  I started to contest and retrhink about my choices. I was thinking to reroll into Leatherworking + Skinning.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
---
Thank you for reading!
---
I also want to know this, I'm on EU Mirage Raceway at the moment.

Why would I fuck up my kids life for a billion dollars?
---
Classicwow.live has class guides, leveling guides, and other things. I use that along with classic.wowhead.com
---
Most are leveling arms up to 60 so do need it
---
is this the same thing as people doing a mount run all the way to the ledge by the graveyard?

half the time I see people getting dazed and dismounted when they try this, was wondering if there was a trick to make it highly consistent.

I mean people have been running SM with just cloth classes all month...

*Laughs in Horde Sword Dungeons Rewards*
---
If it was meant for casters, it wouldn't have the Agi.  You clearly don't understand how the Classic armor ratings work.  In Vanilla it was commonly accepted that you wear whatever gives you the best stats.  The BiS for DPS warriors and ret pallies was mostly leather.  
---
Please leave your retail mentality of "cloth is for casters" at the door.  This is Classic.
---
 Uglydog
---
&gt;If a player dies with mobs next to you and you aren't on their agro table you still get attacked right after.
---
I don't remember this from vanilla but it's one of the best changes in the game if it wasn't in vanilla.  I have to be aware of my surroundings and I can kill horde with wonky mob mechanics.  It's great
---
That probably depends on the context.
---
Want to hear something funny? Even during vanilla people asked for a barber shop to change their appearance. So in the true "spirit of classic" we need these people to ask for it, only to shoot them down. Can't add stuff that 90% of the people want that has no harm on the gameplay.
---
Yeah lol. Why are they even on general if they don't feel like talking or other people talking bothers them, is beyond me!
---
How much time is he facing?
---
What if you toggle to walk from run before the fear?
---
Shitty, o well, re- roll and try again, personally my favourite classes are Druid and paladin because there is so much versatility
---
A bit premature as he's just a suspect? In any case, hope they got the right guy.
---
You don't have to be smart to know how to DDoS, most people that work with computers know how to, but only retards actually do it.
---
A billion dollars would set up your kid for life
---
Weak I've been killing 60 mages since mid 40s
---
&gt;took a break
---
Casual.
---
Probably 60% at level 20, 40% at level 30 and down to about 20% at level 40 if anyone's actually reading this for info.  
---
Maybe 90% when you ding 13 and can equip the GMW which is basically an epic at that level.
---
Tbh classic is just missing out on a lot of much needed class balancing that tbc solved.
---
They are not bis if you are an orc using axes or a human using swords. Since the racial provides the biggest gains from weapon skill. The additional weapon skill is to my understating not worth more than using another pair of gloves.
---
I played Vanilla for over 360 days, you can stop with your stupid "its not retail!11" argument.
---
If you actually played the game you might have noticed that a LOT of items have weird stats.
---
Dude that shit last for like 20 seconds
---
The enchanter can feel free to opt not to, or ask for a service cut.  Rolling greed for vendor is always an option.  They are not obligated to provide that to the group.
---
Same thing happens in my regular pvp server
---
I believe this is entrapment. Also, there is international laws where they can’t go these routes; however, nothing against the law to monitor these people if they have probable cause for wanting to do an illegal activity.
---

Yes please do that so we never have to group with your greedy ass again... Not like there's a million other rogues to invite...

Why do people like you have no filter for reasoning? There is a major diffrence between transmog and a barbershop in wow. One is a personal preference, the other one changes entire visual displays people use to value people their skill and commitment. Nobody ever held any value to haircuts. Mohwak troll? OMG dude must be EU's finest.

Yes especially since there are alot ignoring you for the smallest things. Tbh. Even better if they avoid me already.

na crap, I've stopped leveling my hunter until it's fixed.

Been trying for days, today while camping a random lvl 60 huntard in raid gear logged in and his NE ass ganked me for 30minutes while I looked for BT.
---
I hope to join you soon!!!
---
godamn racist...
---
Hell man no ones got a crystal ball like that. Dropping 75% population? Yeah that’s obviously going to be a problem. However, calling these servers dead today is foolish. 
---
How far down the road you want to go? What happens to Faerilina when streamers stop playing and the twitch kids all move onto the next big thing?
---
How will the game be impacted by the next wow expansion? Will that ruin some servers?
---
What about being stuck on a server with a massive population that never goes down?
---
Turning it on and off again works for me sometimes
---
I fished for Deviat fish right in front of wailing caverns. They sell for 5g a stack on my server and it’s a rather low supply as of now.
---
Seriously, people didn't have the game knowledge to even conceive of spellcleave back then.
---
Sounds amazing.
---
Are you planning to broadcast or have Vods of the top tier duels? Or a league?
---
All undead rogues must be killed relentlessly, it is the rule of law

Question: When exactly did Blizzard made higher level people nigh-invincible to lower level ones? I remember five levels higher people being untouchable even back in Wrath.
---
He's definitely much more mature now. I guess that's what  happens when you become F1's Next Big Thing at age 17.
---
I'm still having to fight for mob spawns and see the other faction constantly, I don't really see the issue m80
---
Strip down the the questing gear and run a mythic and tell me it's less difficult than dungeons in classic.
---
Classic dungeons are a joke.
---
Weird I feel the same about rogues.
---
 I have experienced this as well and was going to leave the same comment.   The second blizzard cast takes a few ticks to begin doing damage.   This is why they lose their slowness and start running full speed.
---
Yessir
---
Badflute is for expecting everyone to know the run
---
Tauren is by far my favorite race, but it would've been fucking grand if the art team had bothered to check how armor looked on Tauren before releasing it. Everything seems designed for humans and it makes Tauren look fucking ridiculous.
---
Less yapping, more buffing.
---
Transmogs
---
They were a hardcore raid guild made up of people who have played the game for a decade and came in with more consumables then have been made on my entire server. Comparing that to a random new player is retarded... Can it be cleared in 40 people in greens absolutely. Does that mean 40 random people in greens can clear it easily hell no, if it did we would have pug MCs going on literally every day.
---
LMFAO someone plays alliance
---
This is false. Green gives the same amount of xp
---
I guess that's what  happens when you become F1's Next Big Thing at age 17. He's definitely much more mature now.
---
Cause that dwarven voice is sexy af
---
Had a mage do that during a Dead Mines run, and at VanCleef he ninja'd the stam/agi cloak. The hunter was pissed.
---
“Funny, she doesn’t look druish”
---
Yep, we're only talking about rogues and rogues specifically here.
---
Nice, those are about 3 silver each on my server. You're gonna need about 500 stacks of those.
---
#jesuisrollie
---
That's a risky strategy. What if the DDoS-guy had a UNO Reverse Card?
---
Unlucky for you I'm leveling a melee survival hunter hehe
---
Worked for me and I’m 28. Where the fucks my billion dollars?
---
Your UI made me throw up in my mouth a little bit.
---
You play melee?
---
Right I get you.
---
Its far more likely that he/she carried out the attack themselves with their own botnet which has been tracked back to a single client controlling the net.
---
All groups I've been with so far usually gives the Rogue locked chests, since we wouldn't even be able to open it if he wasnt there anyways.
---
And the rogue usually gives out the stuff in the chest if he doesn't need it
---
I remember hearing about raid ninjas before they could hearth out after leaving, word spreads fast. You piss enough people off and no one will talk to you.   
---
There were also highly regarded players who everyone admired. Its not about server rep, its about being a good person.
---
Trolls' regeneration is like, one of if not the worst racials in the game. I saw a "what race should I pick" video that broke down the math and basically even at lvl 60 you're looking at a few dozen hp back per fight. The 5% increase Tauren get is orders of magnitude better.
---
Isnt 3 unlimited 4g data in UK? It is in Ireland
---
I bet one got unreasonably angry after having this disease for the full duration and suffering through it only for you to come along and dispel it with about 10 seconds left on the timer.
---
The guy above is right, the guy above him is wrong :D
---
Do Warlocks just get free kills off Rogues if they engage first? Same dude killed me several times yesterday, didn't even see him first couple times. Fighting a mob, suddenly health drops unexpectedly, oh, okay dots I'm dead. Granted he was 60, but even so doesn't seem like I can do much to stay alive once I'm burning and corrupted.
---
That's multiboxing as all the term means is having multiple "boxes" (windows) open at once. And that's not, has never been, and likely will never be against the ToS.
---
Farm shadow reflect trink. Or try and bait fear with feral charge oh yeah iron grenades too.
---
As a holy priest, I try to buff everyone that I pass with my Stamina buff. Even the pets of hunters and warlocks.
---
How do I get to Dark Shore from SW?
---
You sound like you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
A few years ago a SaaS company I worked for had a persistent DDOSer. Basically he would attack our site, then send a ransom email to our main support inbox asking for bitcoin. This happened for a few weeks and it was pretty annoying for me because, as luck would have it, I was the guy who fielded questions from upset customers wondering why our service was unusable lol.
---
This guy basically targeted the entire industry, and I believe the FBI was involved, but nothing ever came of it. 
---
Unfortunately I think some companies paid him off which probably motivated him to keep trying.
---
Again, sick repost.

Orcs are like the Taurens short compact friend that can amazingly bench double the Tauren. Trolls off to the side on the leg machine.
---
Yes and you can opt not to invite the rogue next time for jacking chests. They are not obligated to invite you back. Rogues are pretty much the easiest class to replace so by all means tell him to jack the chest but the etiquette is rolling for it.

Do they even leave bodies if the Alliance Patrol kills them?

Brilliant thank you
---
I think they are layering certain towns and cities seperately. I was in the sepulcher and ran into, the town there I forget the name atm, and a mob despawned as I hit its limits and players popped up too. 
---
If it is solely just a layered town and not a layer change that is more acceptable, however it still feels off.
---
I did some tests in brd. 
---
Arena can be farmed with spellcleave for 50-100k xp per hour, depending on how good and fast you play.
---
A questrun is around 30k per hour killxp, but doing all quests gives another 110k xp. 
---
You need do 2 runs or go turn in quests for pick up follow quests.

What do you think about the half half build to get both prep and cold blood ?

In fairness, healing all warrior groups is a nightmare. Everyone thinks they’re the tank.

Most people just want to level.. but if you're competiting for spawns, gotta do something to pass the time!

Why the hell do druids not attack an undead on site? It's like against everything they are.
---
yeah there will be duel tournaments at the end of each season as well as VODs &amp; youtube videos about all the duels.

Although I'm not super familiar with the crafting aspect I'd be willing to bet TradeSkillMaster has this.
---
You'll find the British and Italians have very little in common as well. Two European nations. 
---
Thus, my point.
---
There is a huge trail left. There is always a trail. The clue is to make the trail so convoluted and confusing it is practically impossible to follow.
---
It's tough to tell where this guy made a mistake, but it has to be a big one if they caught him this fast. Usually the attacker has the advantage: the defenders only need to make one exploitable mistake and the attackers "win".  In this case, the police was on the offense trying to find this guy. These are people who know what they're doing. They found the flaw and traced it all the way back to the guy.
---
Seriously. Don't attack any Western entity from a Western country or one that extradites. You will get caught. Do it from Russia if you want to get away with it.
---
The point is that locks/mages didnt have to raise those skills. Lockpicking you have to go out of your way to raise.
---
No it gives the same exp until you are 6 levels above
---
With that mindset, there is a great chance you may need to reroll a few more times before finding a toon you are wholeheartedly satisfied with. Thing is, every race/class combination has their pro’s and con’s, it’s subjective to say any *one* race/class combination is perfect.
---
I don’t think there’s anymore convincing that can be done, continue to roll more toons until you find the one you are satisfied with.
---
Haha loving this thread.
---
Si señor. Dungeon AoE farms, etc
---
k
---
I have 4 toons.
---
Like killing mobs that drop trash and grays and selling them will generate enough gold to it the essence. Raw gold meaning not having to post in Ah stuff you can vendor
---
They need to reasonably fix PvP before they release BGs, else the PR backlash is gonna be huge.  
---
Melees not missing against players 20 levels higher than them, sheep/fear not being resisted (nor breaking early) by players 20 levels higher, that kinda thing was definitely not happening all the time in vanilla.
---
The people who want to raid not afk dungeons
---
I hope we get namechange soon lol.
---
Dwarven warriors are the worst man. Last night I did a run to Uldaman as 55 SP in pursue of artisan enchanting. Everything went fine until the final stages when I really had to drink between fights to regain mana.
---
In the room where you activate the 4 golems i rebuff the group and start to drink. In other monitor I have Youtube open cause the run is so easy I really didn't need to focus much. Then this Dwarf warrior tank goes in and I didn't notice. At half mana bar I do and I'm like wtf u doing, im drinking and you go in and dont even lure them here behind the corner where I am at. Then this Dwarf start blaming that I'm not even healing even though I am keeping them most of the time alive in my shadowform. What a prick. Then we get to the 4 big golems and Im in my shadowform dpsing and tanking basically not losing health at all. Then he decides cause he is the tank to take the aggro and proceeds to die. I was so triggered by his assholery and didn't care to switch and heal him. I was like bro, why didn't you let me tank. Then he proceeds, go ahead be a tank and rest of the guys are like, stop this and let's just finish this as we're supposed to. Then we proceed and this guy literally doesn't do any tanking and gets us wiped and then kicks me out of the group "go back to retail". Never played WoW before classic, so jokes on him I guess. I got what I wanted but feel sorry for the rest of the guys, they were fine, funny dudes I enjoyed playing with.
---
Dwarf players are the worst. Gnomes come next.
---
*laughs in gutterspeak*
---
That’s a moot point considering the actual class and party composition matters more than wearing gear or not.
---
If only there would be a way to test this before launch and get feedback from players to fix. Hmmm
---
&gt;Imagine being in this guys group - He gets 5 chances at the drop while you just get 1. 
---
Whilst true for retail it's false for Classic. Only one person can get the full loot in Classic. Besides... 5x the cost as well.
---
Killed him while questing... Typical Horde scum.
---
I think I know why Testiklar loves RP servers.
---
Got a Death Speak Scepter drop from RFK yesterday. Should i use that along Orb of Mistmantle instead of my Rod of the Sleepwalker? I'm a lvl 29 shadowpriest
---
Is that really you ben stiller? Amazing
---
&gt; I abandoned her shortly thereafter for a priest.
---
Those damn homewreckers!!!!
---
When it's a matter of opinion and etiquette, yes they are.
---
You are committing a fallacy fallacy, implying that the "Appeal to Popularity" fallacy applies here, when it doesn't. Logical fallacies only apply to logical arguments, this one is straight up a matter of opinion, there is no factually correct. So it absolutely is correct to argue that since most people prefer if people do not need to sell something on the AH, there is a certain expectation on the rest of the server population to comply, lest they be ousted as the ninja looters they are.
---
I can't tell if you're serious lmao
---
Woho for classic! But to be fair i also see all the servers on low sometimes ^^
---
Before camping BT I tamed one of the stalkers there and named it Broken, seemed fitting and deceiving.
---
Ah thanks, makes sense, I’m new to Vanilla and it didn’t seem like it was happening much at all but I didn’t know for sure. Good to know
---
Jaffa kree!
---
Juicysmooyay - if you know, you know
---
WoD wasn't actually that terrible. Had some of the most unique raids in my opinion, and garrisons weren't all bad... and plus everyone was rich in WoD, just by doing things that any player could do you could make enough gold to play for free
---
You may wanna google "vocal minority", which is what you are a part of.
---
As a Finn, I take offense to you assuming Kimi would be a Retadin. Though I personally can't come up with any frost mage pun that would start with R, so I digress.
---
What realm/region are you on? Also which faction are you?
---
Seething hatred and distrust in the opposing faction is healthy for the game, it gives you something in common with your fellow faction members and a common goal.
---
Yeah, I always imagine bots like this to have a dwarven accent
---
It may be hypothyroidism get some bloodwork done dude.
---
Hardly anything? You really think that its rational to say that someone using a given graphical setting, provided by the dev team officially, should result a ban? :') oh boy
---
Only downfall of not being undead is I cant eat alliance after I kill them. I have had to just have a /sit macro instead.
---
Name and shame. There's no downside to being a dick otherwise.
---
Your on that server?
---
i did that last night at level 45 and it was a blast. went from helping hordies who were being attacked by a 36 spriest in the yeti cave, to 2v4ing warriors+priest, into another 2v4 outside the cave, and then it became a big 10v10 ally vs horde in the fields. alliance brought a 60 mage but we still won lol.
---
He's not going to get shit to be fair. Maybe a slap on the wrist - the guy was based in Europe and interpol is notoriously and hilariously bad at catching any kind of international criminal (other than whistleblowers).
---
Also there's no proof they actually caught anything lol. Just a statement - no news report, no link to a credible source, just "ladies and gents we got him :))".
---
Cosmetics suck.
---
How ‘should’ they have anything better when drops are random?
---
On my server, 5x of them are worth 30s.😅
---
I don't even see the point before the PvP system. I tend to be very cautious about attacking Alliance, it's either for revenge or helping other Horde who really seem to need it.
---
Lol that escalated quickly
---
NA I'm on sulfras and if a rogue jacks the group's chest people tend to lose their shit.
---
Yes, thats it. I said the wrong name too :P
---
$11!!@@#$@ fucking!!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$

a lot of the bugfixes we've been getting in classic are literally bugs that didn't get fixed until BC. They went FULL nochanges with it.

Chaos breeds chaos

Only in Freedom Land
---
Personally as a priest healer in those groups i find cleaves way more interesting, especially if the group is kinda bad because i can't fall into routine and have to keep paying attention and adapting to whatever mistakes are being made. Honestly the main reason i look for cleaves is fun not even the exp.
---
Name 1 belt that gives 6 agi at level 25... rofl.  You're the type that would bitch at hunters for rolling on the Lavishly Jeweled Ring too.
---
How much /played do you have? Then think about how long the game is out now. Then rethink your statement.
---
Last mc I was 9th in dmg as a ret, close to 4 in absolute numbers and I don't have a crazy good weapon.
---
While leveling they probably start with 0 energy in Cat Form.
---
Combat sword spec here but sometimes for fun I’ll bring a dagger in my bag and I have a macro set to put that dagger in my MH when I go into stealth and a macro set on ambush to swap my two swords back after casting ambush. Quite a bit of fun😃
---
I would still say it's part of your kit.
---
Grats, you had to work to get it leveled. Which if we have to be honest. There is worse things than gaining lock pick skill, and last time I did it on a rogue, got my fair share of gold and cloth. 
---
In the end It's still part of the kit you provide to the group while going through a dungeon. If you decide that you want specific rewards for you to use your kit, whether that be an ability you paid to get, a spell from a drop, a minion gained through a quest or something you leveled, I would see you as a prick.
---
How exactly does it work? Is the duels decided by the addon/website? or do i just pick someone else that's using the addon and duel them?
---
Dude I mained a feral druid during BC and you are flat out wrong. Shit like rings worked because they improved your weapon damage, so staff or cat claws or whatever you were using was increased. Can't speak for later expansions but during classic and TBC your weapon's acual dps had zero influence on shapeshifted damage.
---
Last post like this I seen I put wtf, but I got downvoted to shit. So I’ll say ‘ok’ and move on.
---
Why do they all sound like the same person?
---
You can also logout and play alt Druid when you wait for lockout cd
---
I'm big fan of the Tauren starting area but past that, I'd be orc 100%
---
I bet ur undead with an alt code in ur name
---
Less QQ, more PewPew.
---
When someone forms a group and carries you and other players with worse gear, why shouldn't they be allowed to reserve something? When you're willing to tank a dungeon while everybody's looking for tanks on /world, why would you not reserve a specific loot? I mean if you're being saved an hour of your time by someone being willing to tank for you, why are you bitching about 1 item?
---
Can I have it too? This is something useful.
---
No, I'm not on any RP server. I just think it's very likely most people on any RP server will choose alliance since Goldshire is a very popular and typical place on RP servers (or so I think)
---
He got gotted gud
---
And you can learn fishing for free from this guy.
---
I'm not sure how it would go, but I'm hoping after off-tanking a few times they will let me try it for the lulz. Regardless, I've only been tanking so I'd like to find a talent tree that focuses on maximizing tank potential &gt; dps or heals
---
Not a hunter, but in general slow weapons are preferred (mostly important if you abilities do a % of weapon damage)
---
Yeet
---
He is probably french !
---
... Isn't he calling himself a potato human, making fun of himself?
---
You'll be forever missed UkDrillarz, hope they don't drill you too hard in prison
---
i farmed hoj with another rogue, just 2 guys, pop CDs, nuke him, loot, vanish, reset, repeat.
---
it works but only if you have multiple accounts
---
when you log in with the same acc a second time the first instance will be kicked
---
Yes, no mercy for hunters. Hate them on retail, hate them even more on classic.
---
But for real, guilds aren’t likely to even give you a chance to tank :/ sadly.
---
Are hunters as bad as my friends are making it seem? Will I be unable to find a raid spot like they claim? Cause if so I’m thinking I’ll just roll a rogue.
---
You can teach best practices though.
---
You just can't make him follow them.
---
Agree with the grey choice! That’s what I thought before reading your post. My dwarf priest is also definitely on the lighter side, since he’s spent his whole life underground and in the cathedrals.
---
\*runs to end of Booty Bay wharf where a Human Warrior and an Orc Rogue are waiting\*
---
Me- "We're about to end this warrior's entire career"  
---
Orc- "He knows."  
---
Warrior- "Vrum bur"
---
with an experienced group, full clear takes 2 hours. regular run where you skip trash bosses, 1 hour.
---
As far as I know/can find, 5+ levels above a quest (when it becomes gray) you lose 20% reputation per level until you reach 10 levels above which is the floor at 20% of reputation.
---
 Lok'tar ogar! For the Horde!
---
It has 20 yards range and a 1.5 second cast time. Only direct damage procs daze, no pure dots will. The pet will be either be trapped or attacked by my pet and eventually die, the lock will be slowed and sometimes stunned by concussive shot. Viper Sting will force them to slowly kill themselves with Life Tap.
---
WATCH YER BACK!
---
You’ve never played rogue or warrior then. It’s like 10 APM.
---
These kind of players make me doubt my idea of leveling a Mage. Will I as a mage be forced to do spellcleave AOE runs? That's not really my playstyle at all.
---
Yeah, as soon as it happened people found the dude's email/twitter. I even think a Blizz employee asked how dumb you can be to match a twitter pic with a FB profile pic. Dude was a dumb motherfucker.
---
Depends on the level but I would rather open with pounce, bleeds moonfire root and restealth open again with 100 energy.
---
No idea what stats those items have but spl dmg &gt;&gt; everything else. Spirit is the next best stat while questing
---
General answer to weapon speed mattering is that if you have abilities that do damage based on your weapon damage, then a slow weapon is better in main hand as the said abilities will hit harder.
---
Fast weapons are only really better when held in offhand, as they do not matter to the mentioned abilities that use main hand, but can be useful for something like applying rogue poisons at faster rate.
---
If there is no abilities present that would use your weapon damage, then the speed of weapons is irrelevant.
---
Too bad that site doesn't give any info on the races of those players. I want to see how many gnome warriors there are.
---
Whatever happens in BRD, stays in BRD
---
our ranking system distinguishs between global ,realms, classes and even specs
---
so you could grab your rank1 as a e.g. holy priest :)
---
awesome !
---
Just camp at the spawn point which is exactly in front of the house with the Apothecary, near where Quae and Kinelory are. He spawns there every few min and is usually killed instantly, so he doesnt even get to patrolling. And once he gets to Hillsbrad, he disappears and respawns at the farm again, so you can't miss him that way.
---
**nochange**
---
For a few days? More like a few hours.
---
No streamer as big as Asmongold is going to be too mad for long about free advertising and clicks; even if it impedes their current aims.
---
Ferals have no such vanishing tool so they'd be F'ed, but point taken, a group of five is not needed ;)
---
31 or 32 for the graveyard, then again at ~35 for the armory
---
As a balance druid though?
---
I've been running Cencus for a week(An addon that scans /who) and so far Rogue is the least played class on horde on my realm, just behind Druids.
---
But I think the only reason Rogues are behind Druids is because I'm on a PvE realm.
---
I'm a druid and I went around Darnassus moonfiring all the deer and rabbits for skinning moolah to buy spells... Kinda goes against the whole hug a tree thing too...
---
Lmao, each layer is the same pop as a vanilla server. Go spread your shit elsewhere.
---
Without layering high pop servers would be a shit show of overcrowding.
---
10 days waiting for a maximum of 1,5 levels of rested exp.
---
Totally not worth waiting when you an just play.
---
Ret does servicable dps especially at trash unless the player is a retard like you
---
He is not talking about viewing distance for the environment. He is asking how can he increase the radius in which mobs and players become visible to him on the server, as now at a certain distance mobs fade in and out depending on your camera angle.
---
I too am looking for an option to increase this radius but as of yet, there is no possibility to do so.
---
Yeah, I've been flipping the recipes on the cross faction AH. If you level in the barrens odds are pretty good (not a sure thing, but pretty good) that you'll see the recipe drop. Every other Horde thinks it's their ticket to a lvl 40 mount, so the market is flooded with delights.
---
However, alliance don't level in barrens. The recipe goes for 3-4 times more on the cross faction AH because it's a huge pain in the ass to farm a random world drop in hostile territory!
---
That's the entire point.
---
You've described sharding which isn't layering. 
---
The devs looked into anecdotes like yours and found that most of them had a layer change queued and it triggered when they did something perceptible like going into a town and people thought that going into towns was changing layers which isn't true.
---
Shamans are too rare to get 1 per group
---
Even in tbc wotlk when they feel better they were still luxuries
---
Okay now I read it all over again with this in mind.. that's ducking hilarious!
---
Idk ‘bout other servers but on mine the Horde is like your neighbourhood bully, if he’s alone he’s fine. Got friends? Better run. So hate? Nah. Rolling-of-the-eyes behavior? Yes.
---
Yes it’s fine, been using for awhile. As a bonus, if you create a group with only yourself, and an alt, you can use your alt to reset the dungeon and solo it :D
---
ah, yes. my server.
---
I didn't really mind that one even after the 200th time... Ulduar was just too good I'd forgive every flaw in an instant.
---
You can do an arena + angerforge run in 15-20 mins. Lots of mages will wanting to do arena runs so shouldn't be too hard to find a group.
---
Meanwhile, my feared mobs still run faster than Usain Bolt. Classic best private server 2019.
---
Afaik they are good designated tank healers
---
Changing the racial is the whole point though.
---
Don't really remember but I think race change came after vanilla. Either way it's hard to say if/when classic will get it.
---
I believe it didn’t come out until either late wrath or early Cata.
---
But why
---
I have a horde guild with 400+ members on Stonespine if you want us to a price on his head or w/e.
---
you have been banned from /r/WoWDruids
---
True, true and true. I had the chance to play Zelda BOTW. O man. That game has nailed it. No hand holding at all. Epic adventure and you can have 15-20 minutes sessions. What a design. If they ever decide to do an MMO with that formula will be grand.
---
it shouldn't be possible to transfer directly from your retail char to your classic char but I think trading with another player is fine
---
the exchange rate is probably something like 1mil retail = 1k classic
---
That is some usefull data.
---
However. I see that the % table includes level 61-70 aswell.  
---
Doesn't this mean that the data is based on TBC?
---
Not exactly. I was today years old when i even learned about it
---
Same situation happened to me in an SM cath group. Joined a group and there was another mage and a warlock. Mage started berating me because he pulled aggro and my blizzard didn't slow when they chased him because I haven't specced imp blizzard. Bitch I don't wanna sit in SM/ZF all day aoe spamming.
---
Lol. That's Joe Rogan's dog, isn't it?
---
F
---
Ugly useless creature.
---
It's a good strat. It lets the adds stream in one by one and the boss is nearly dead before the big guys show up.
---
See,if the roles were reversed horde would show no mercy/honor.
---
Also an isolated gamer. 39 years old without any RL gaming buddies. But classic WoW is going to facilitate me having some gaming buds when I find a good guild to join soon. MMO are really fun to play with guildies and you can make some good friends in the process.
---
My waifu isn’t into gaming at all. It’s mostly something I do that she tolerates but she’s come around on it after explaining that it is a hobby I enjoy and is an ok hobby considering alternatives. I gladly tell people I’m a pc gamer and that I built my pc. Some think it’s cool, others give me stupid looks. I couldn’t care less what people think about my hobby at the end of the day though. I don’t think anyone is in a good position to judge.
---
How about crab cakes?
---
Yeh... nobody cares about the horde. You are probably on a server with a faction imbalance and those alliance guys had a really though time leveling because of kids killing alliance on unfair fights. Serves you good. I'll probably do the same to relieve some of my accumulated stress from playing in such a server.
---
I’ve always wondered what that was, what is that? Is it some dungeon instance or something?
---
I would agree with this if every DPS I’ve grouped with so far wouldn’t turn schizo and start running across the instance as soon as a mob turns and hits them 2 or 3 times. 
---
I don’t understand why people think they can run away from the mobs. Just take them to the tank.
---
it is probably even less, but yes
---
Oh shit, didn't read it properly. Thought he wanted gnome racial but didn't like the look of gnomes
---
Just run him through whatever dungeon is level appropriate over and over.
---
Life tap + Cannibalize = priceless
---
Carebears, carebears everywhere.
---
This for sure! I've played a mage every expansion! Didn't even try anything else basically until late MoP! Tried a warr and dk alt, ended up in Legion to just make a mage alt for my mage main..
---
Loved that pet, took me ages to finally get him though
---
it was tough doing it this week with my rogue buddy but we were geared and it worked out, rarely one of us died but the drops cover the repair costs. i sorta gave up on HoJ though, I'll go when I find a group, otherwise meh.
---
Is it an add on? If so, then no. The code accessible for use by add ons is specifically chosen by Blizzard as being okay to use. Blizzard actually implements that code into their game for people to make use of.
---
A major reason a lot of people enjoy classic is to escape the GOGOGO power-leveling/instance-spamming attitude from retail so they don't like seeing the attitude becoming meta in classic too
---
No not for a civil war. To protect the public from a government that becomes a tyranny. To fight the government if they become overbearing. The founders of the USA came here to escape a tyrannical government and wanted the citizens here to be able to fight back if our government became like that they had left.
---
Some really weird slang
---
you can just get someone whos using the addon aswell, and do some duels together
---
based on both of you guys rating, we have an elo system which defines who gets how many points for the match
---
on the other hand, you can look for specific people on our page and whisper  them, if you want to compete against someone with a specific rank
---
I'm not here to save you from yourself.
---
some methods could be you stay near him and let him tag a mob while you kill it, or you could run dungeons with him. or another option is you make an alt and just quest and level with him side by side.
---
Indeed
---
A great secondary reason to bring the shadow priest, is to put him in the tank group so the tanks benefit from Vampiric Embrace.
---
Classic: “we don’t do that here”
---
This has definately been my experience so far
---
Dogshit level of unbalance. It's literally RNG that determines 90% of fights. Oh, you got windfuried? 100-&gt;0. Sorry about that, be better at not getting rickrolled by an rng face masher. Fear/Blind gets resisted? Oh, sorry about that. You weren't good enough to roll your way to victory. Try again when you find a four-leafed clover.
---
Until you get to lvl 60 and are specifically raiding “molten core” or “Onyxia” you likely won’t need to worry about buffs or consumable items.  
---
In classic, most guilds just use that stuff when they are ready to speed clear end game content with big dick dps.  
---
But any class guide with a raid section should give you an idea of what you want.
---
Yes I would agree with your point  I think most countries in Europe are distinct and different with differing values, cultures, history and to an extent architecture. It's what makes Europe so interesting.
---
I was pointing out your incorrect use of the word Europe and reminding you that Britain is part of Europe. 
---
Just a thought, Italians and British do not have much in common and there is a large number of Italians in the US would you say that Italian culture/beliefs and values could possibly, may well have done, might have found it's way into the US and thus creating similarities between the two nations? I dunno, not an expert on the subject...I leave that to you, you like comparing nations.
---
To save time, there is a place to the west of Ironforge in Dun Morogh where you can run up and over into the Wetlands. You can fall to your death and spirit res at the graveyard just outside Menethil Harbor. It saves running through Dun Morogh, Loch Modan and the Wetlands.
---
Addons dont get you banned, would be kinda ironic for them to allow a language that lets you automate tasks.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable.
---
Tor is not untraceable. They make busts on the onion router all the time.
---
Or if anyone wants to participate in a skilled exchange. But fuck that, who wants to actually let skill determine who wins and who gets one shot?
---
Expect the same
---
Congratz ! You are lucky those alliance are cool, because if this was me,you will be dead just like the two horde hunters who tried to tame BT in front of me.... Poor guys.
---
This whole time I was wondering why I couldn’t FD and trap. I thought my memory was becoming worst and I made the whole thing up in my head.
---
Yep. Race is an artificial concept promoted by the bourgeois vendor class so that we wouldn't notice the true conflict!
---
Feels like hillsbrad at 25-30
---
lmao
---
I never ever sell or AH my healing potions. Those always go to the warriors I group with.
---
But they cost like 20 silver lol
---
Sounds like someone I would never want to watch.
---
1 shadow priest per raid, good luck
---
Don't shame rogues being 41 without mount.
---
Could you specify 'auto accept'? Instant-quest text is in interface options and using guides to tell you which quests to take and where to go for these quests is all legal.
---
Does it accept quests without you being near the questgiver or something?
---
Originally World of Warcraft was going to have a player housing area. This was the portal to said zone but it was scrapped from the game before launch.
---
Someone should check if these correlate with when streamers are on, that would be useful.
---
As a Rogue I agree with this a whole lot. Lower lvl mobs are no issue at all.
---
It also works on shamans in ghost wolf.
---
WASH YER BACK !
---
only stupid guilds wouldn't let a bear tank.
---
If you type /who 17-21, you get a list of all (caps at 50) players in the level range for deadmines. You can whisper individual people to see if they are interested.
---
Pretty disappointing that they still haven't fixed this but at least there's some hope.
---
It's hard enough as it is to justify playing hunter over mage.
---
Don't know what server you are one but on this site you can find some censuses, they are not 100% trustworthy cause a lot of players will rerrol or drop their class but it's a start:  [http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/ZandalarTribe](http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/ZandalarTribe)
---
I'm a hunter and to be honest, i wouldn't need on this. It has no stats and nothing useful for me. However it looks cool tho!
---
true feelsbad
---
Oh geez!
---
Reminds me of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKZFv1cFonk
---
(youtube: SKZFv1cFonk)
---
You bring dishonor to the alliance.
---
/spit
---
This isn’t cool. It’s disturbing.
---
Details is a dps meter, with tinythreat included.
---
Well actually for the horde!!! , you sound like a pathetic alliance scum anyway and firemaw is relatively balanced in its factions
---
this. you have to give it an extra second and not touch anything except your macro and spam that macro. (pvp with no mob aggro) not at all how it worked in vanilla but its how it currently works.
---
No they don't . Auto acept and auto turn in quest add-ons exist since vanilla days.
---
How good is the imperial plate set? What's a good endgame gear for pvp ret pally?
---
Never understood rp pvp.isnt wow already a role playing game? I'm a real person role playing as a fictional character. So it's role playing server in role playing game? I don't get it?
---
A lot of druids are actually working on finding a cure to undeath. We don't hate the dead, and actually want to help them. Plus it'd be great research to complete should we ever hope to cure the plaguelands.
---
I would also like to know... I couldn't find Chatter for classic.
---
Back in BfA boy quickly.
---
What's the difference
---
There were two people IIRC. One of them got like 3 months of jail time, for the actual ddos. The other one, once they began investigating him, went down for a whole slew of unrelated shit, which all added up to about 10 years.
---
Yeah, I can kite but can't tank.  You can also kite the croc, tanking seems hard too.
---
I have this rule for myself, if i attack ppl lower level than me then i shouldn't be a wuss and not attack ppl higher level than. Thats right just because you're level 48 and im 40 doesnt mean you can lower your guard and fear my babyrage lvl 60's.
---
&gt; I'm almost sure if it was horde running around they would kill me asap.
---
Just had a ?? alliance warlock get off his mount in Ashenvale just to dot me up.  Right after that I ran past two around my level and they just waved at me.  I feel like it's a level thing.  Super high level?  Time to fuck with everyone you see.
---
Its literally a MMO(Role playing game). How can you even deduct an ounce of a real person's personality through a PVP encounter with them that is action based with emotes. You have no idea how that person is in real life, might be nicest dude in the world - and likes to KOS because that's how he wants to his gameplay to be, and finds it fun - in a **simulated world.**
---
Good points! I think there is also the fact the game, during the pex phase is harder, more punitive. There it forces people to work together to achieve an orange or elite quest.
---
We all have been in a situation where the outcome could have been different if you had 40 more hp, a bit more mana. That’s also why we trade buffs so much
---
Sure, if you want to abuse such a thing. Not everyones cup of tea.
---
I think the key word here is *may.*
---
So it does not always interrupt the effect.
---
It's not a lie.
---
Green quests and tank dungeons for good blues
---
Ez
---
That’s kinda the premise behind multibox Hunters right? Sending in five pets is like the tankiest tank to have ever tanked while leveling. 
---
Kinda a fun tangent, when I played Everquest as a kid there was some monster (kinda like an elite in WoW I guess? I was super young) that the pet classes would kill by waves of pets at him and resummoning them when they died, to charge at him again.
---
No, I am lvl 54 now, didn't do all the NE rep quests, and only am at 2k/21k from exalted (still have winterspring etc on my todo list).  Expect to turn in hundreds of runecloth stacks still. Doable, but an extra hurdle to get the epic.
---
This is bis devilsaur leather for all healers, lucky find!
---
ohh ok thats good to know. i just now saw that this addon has had over 140k downloads so it's probably in the clear. thanks!
---
the orc ?
---
You're so clever and your answer so insightful. Why don't you go get hit by a train?
---
Wait for phase 2. Where the real killing starts.
---
Let’s say you are in WW2 as an American and a Nazi soldier was near you, are you going to let them love?
---
Only with true RNG. WoW uses pseuo-RNG, so such long hains are impossible
---
This I not some random public official! Its a transportation officer of the Cenarion Circle, a neutral force of Druids tasked with the protection of natural balance in Azeroth. Your whimsical request to fly does not require their attention. There is a commercial flight vendor as far as possible out of town for your convenience.
---
Ps: these high and mighty fuckers only let druids to fly to TB or Darnassus, but free of charge.
---
Not sure about the best way, but you could heal spec now, and try to run dungeons often. In between dungeons, farm herbs.
---
No they didn't.
---
Seriously who buy wolf meat???
---
I’m enjoying these so much. Such a great feel to it!
---
I am a druid, just in travel form!
---
An arms war took my (c rog) jang sword
---
int ring dropped in dm warrior need rolled and won i was the priest healer said he needed because int help him level his weapon still pissed about that.
---
Based on what? Commenters on this sub who are the 5% of the community at most (and even less in EU subs). You’ll have no problem getting a spot as a tank if you’re not playing with boring min-maxers. Farming MCP is also really not that much work.
---
The gnomish death ray can hit for some insane damage if the numbers are in your favor since you can proc double damage on a big crit and hit for some massive ohk damage I heard that someone once got 8k in one hit don't know how true because I wasn't there.
---
Cant mindcontrol druids in forms. They are not considered humanoids when shapeshifted, samr with ghost wolf
---
I've only rarely seen an alliance member picking on lower level horde. I have been ganked by higher level horde more times than I can count. But they created a monster as every time it happened to me I'd kill 10 more low level horde and the cycles continues.
---
The scrolling combat text looks sick with the sword spec and wf wep procs showing, what’s it called?
---
Lvl 42 is close to past where grinding sm is beneficial. If you quest for a couple more lvls, then you can farm zip farrak (Tanaris dungeon)
---
Just to be clear, in case that's not obvious: the spot they're attacking from — guards can't reach them there, so they don't even bother. Essentially you can kill people from that spot with no consequence whatsoever.
---
There are clever ways to DDoS being discovered by security researchers all the time. It's not always just skids with a rented botnet.
---
My daggery rogue gonna have a great life
---
You will. 
---
If you spam.dungeons you will have some great items but there are a lot of slots for every type that don't have a drop in dungeons. 
---
For example, my shaman might have terrible bracers and legs because nothing drops for them (iirc) in early dungeons
---
Pro-tip: you don’t see your faction doing it because they can’t attack you
---
&gt; wandering around and doing stupid shit.
---
I find that is what makes classic fun though. Retail is too streamlined and formolaic, having fun doing inefficient things screwing around and passing time is how i play classic and I'm having a blast to the point of not even feeling the same game retail wow it.
---
But as long as you are also having fun please go ahead.
---
I have to admit is kind of frustrating to me seeing everyone leveling faster than me because of it, i notice it specially in big cities where mounts would be rare and now a good third of the characters seem to have one, while I'm still in my 20s.
---
Show us a target!
---
Come on, shorty.
---
On our way.
---
Eat hot death!
---
And that's how baby dwarves are made!
---
and hidden quests.
---
speaking of being respectful....

Sorry, my vad, it was some players who made a list
---
I think it might be the 5 day... my guild downed her yesterday and plans to go again on Monday. Not 100% tho!
---
We have an Illegal Danish meme guild on Whitemane Horde. It prompted me to go repost these movies in our guild Discord spam channel. I never forgot where it came from, but I've been saying it a lot to people over the years.
---
I play prot paladin (lvl40) with alot of ingi and looking allways for 1vs2 against warriors and rogues. 
---
Love to ram my godly shild up your arse as i block you to the graveyard.

Mages can suck my bubble +port.

Cant wait to reach lvl 60..... in a year or so
---
Ret prio
---
Tagging a mob gives you relative xp based on how much of the damage you did to it. If you just tag the mob and your high-level mate kills it for you, you receive very little xp. It's not worthwhile.
---
Not just on tor, on a minimal operating system running on a USB stick using the free wifi at the hospital. 
---
The level of not careful people are when doing illegal shit is crazy.

I just don't do anything illegal out of pure laziness, but if your going to / Elite Hack^tm a corporation, perhaps some discretion would be in order.
---
I'm not sure if it keeps you in RP walk when you get feared.
---
Just start a comic, dude. 
---
A comic that details your leveling experiance. 
---
Or something.
---
I’m a warlock actually, definitely not kiting that croco
---
How do you think these guilds are getting big? By inviting literally everyone.
---
Have an engineer craft you an Ornate Spyglass. It's not much, but it does help in taking a quick peek at what's ahead.
---
That would be spectacularly stupid. But it would explain the timing. Wow... Definitely a script kiddie then...
---
Exactly what I told my wife when she made me go to Costco with her the other day
---
I tank as a Paladin in dungeons, I don’t actively seek out AoE groups, but if I get a Warlock and a Mage then hey, smoke me while you got em.
---
gz :&gt;
---
How do u fake counter spell ?
---
Is Prat available? Looks like it.

---
Lol that’s just nonsense
---
Lol @ you downvoting and going off on me. I'm not OP, was just clarifying a point they made.
---
I wrote an addon called "Thanks for the Buff" you can set a custom emote (or a random one) when you get buffed by another player in the wild (no party or raid members buffing you)
---

---
Gives me a little more faith about playing it then.
---
Model swapping will get you banned though. They’ve cracked down on that a lot.
---
Says cooking fire, not camp fire
---
we keep a close eye on things like that
---
further more everybody can access the combat log for all duels listed on our page, so there is a transparent view on all the action going on
---
You will also get a free account eventually, if you fiddle around with game files.
---
&gt; Ya but who the fuck wants to spend time in Gnomer ~~every week for the rest of their wow career~~?
---
Fixed that for you!
---
People who want to run dungeons traditionally want Mages all the same as Spellcleave groups do.
---
Thank you for the answer :D
---
I wish I would run into someone doing this, I feel like psychic scream is a real pain in the ass for them.
---
Wait how do US laws apply to him on Romanian soil?
---
No they are not, by definition. This is not ninjalooting. Anyone rolling need to sell if someone else rolls need to equip is though.
---
Because of how french language is actually written, we need more 'symbols' than  english speakers. 
---
For instance, accents a widely used in french. So we need a key to do each of those individually : é è à or even ç to some extend. The are often used, more often so than numbers so it's actually more convenient for us this way. 
---
It's not ridiculous, it's just more efficient!
---
It'd make a great instance loading screen wallpaper picture thingie.
---
I pretty much only quested from 1-60 without much killing mobs on they way unless I was able to move and kill them at the same time efficiently. the only dungeons I did was SM once, ZF twice, and a few loot runs in BRD with my guild around 57-58 but the BRD runs whas very minimal XP as we barely killed mobs on the way to the bosses. You can absolutly quest all the way with no grinding, even easier if you also do dungeon quests. Worth noting when doing that though is that you will have to travel and Green quests are much better than orange, green is almost as good as yellow and orange is bad.
---
Of course you don't, you classist filth!
---
Ive only seen alliance attack while outnumbering or while youre low or by being higher level. Ive seen lvl 50s-60s camping tarren mills everyday for hours. I dont understand what the goal is for them lol.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15271/colossal-great-axe](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15271/colossal-great-axe)  Use this at lvl 51, that's what i did. Found one with 15 str on ah for like 7g(sells for 4g)
---
&gt;  I never notice until you nerds complain.
---
Try using EYES
---
What worth? Most things are _still_ sold at vendor sell price here
---
Not necessarily. The current Government is very lenient with criminals. He might have gotten a suspended sentence or very early parole in here. Hell, he might have gotten monetary compensation for being in a crowded prison :))
---
Go the fuck to sleep, why even stay up for 48 hours for a game that has been out for a couple of weeks?
---
Report with cheating-&gt;terrain abuse. I think that results with temp ban.
---
Yessir. To ease your mind you can always ask in guild chat first etc, but from my experience I've never had anybody ninja my mats.
---
honestly i think when you are already mounted up and running somewhere its just not worth the time to dismount and go kill a lowbie
---
Also tips are appreciated
---
All characters have place in a raid, true that some classes are "easier" to find spots than others but that has more to do with class rarity on a server than the class itself.
---
You should be fine.
---
What an amateur lmao
---
Sounds like my hunter trying to save the key with the out of combat engie rez.
---
"IT DIDN'T WORK" - random group member
---
As a hunter I'd rather have a weapon (or DW 2 weapons) that give me 5 agi, than one that has no stats but big damage.
---
Horde have far better flight paths and Zeppelin/ship routes.
---
Hello, 
---
im lvl 11 at the moment. I dont have much time for playing and im totally obsesed by making gold . 
---
TSM is such a mighty tool and i dont know how to start. Maybe i just should play and level...
---
Any suggestions?
---
Ashbringer drops from Naxx. It\`s corrupted, though.
---
Can confirm, 29 here and still going strong.
---
I play exclusively gnome. Becaus they are short. I love being this miniature creature and blowing up tauren and trolls with big warrior crits on my tine little gnome.
---
It depend, if it's a unique drop to that particular mob, include it, if its a world drop, don't. In both cases, mention it is a thing that could happen if you're lucky.
---
Only in America. ;)
---
Just strength, stamina, and some int if you want. You will need to fight the warriors for all their gear if you don't just buy it.
---
Wonder if  "paperakira", will respond to this actual logical point that - believe it or not people's decisions in fictional worlds have no real bearing on how they act in real life. 
---
Funny because his argument is along the same lines as the 'video games cause violence' lie. Which I'm sure is a hill he doesn't want to die on. So some major cognitive dissonance going on there.
---
What server?
---
You predict when the opponent will CS and interrupt the cast just before it.
---
I was rocking some Dreamsinger legguards for a while. Fabulous purple scale pants.
---
Wow
---
And if they haven't yet, they will.
---
My warrior friend tanks with ravager lol. No aoe threat otherwise. Though I've got to say, Ravager procs so little that he's got very little aoe threat anyway.
---
I've used it on and off since MoP and havn't heard anything about anyone getting banned
---
yep, I tried oily blackmouth a bit, but people aren't buying them much yet.
---
Goes in with 50% hp...
---
It's exactly the same, but it feels justified on the horde.
---
Talk shit get hit
---
I love my tremor totem
---
When I get messaged and I’m in a group alrdy I just say so and move on.. not hard
---
That's my first Patreon goal :P if it all goes well, "A Classic Journey" Issue #1 will happen!   
---
Description:  
---
Set within the World of Warcraft universe, we'll join two groups of characters as they embark in a journey filled with hardship, strife and unexpected lessons.  
---
One group start their journey in the harsh, rugged land of Durotar, home to the newly settled orcs of Draenor and the native Darkspear trolls. However, the winds are changing, and they utter words of dark, wicked forces gathering within the great Horde's home, Orgrimmar.  
---
The other group are brought together in the seemingly peaceful Elwynn Forest which shelters the mighty capital Stormwind City. But all is not well in the shining jewel of the Alliance as rumors have it that the king, Varian Wrynn, has gone missing.  
---
Though worlds apart, both of these parties will realize that old wounds never heal.  
---
They will learn that it is in time of peace that you must prepare for war.
---
Eh, I guess you need to get some kills with comparable forces before you get rolled.
---
Wrong post lol
---
As a druid it is free direct to teldra or TB
---
Never use it on succubus. Unless I'm mistaken any damage will break the charm, whereas the lock can still damage you through fear. Bubble fear after the lock applies all dots, it makes fear DR faster and wastes a bunch of mana for the warlock. My pally friend almost beat me today because I ran out of mana dueling him lmao.
---
Yea, there's a difference in killing someone and moving away and corpse camping and killing the same player over and over again. Its down right harassing
---
I would say at phase two but if you are the type to play the auction house I would try to sell it now and buy up a lot of easier to move products.
---
They will. On a stable economy the deviates sell for a decent price usually. Once people start having disposable gold income
---
Wow is racist af.
---
50k for 100g you wish...
---
A token in europe is 250k gold wich is 13 euro
---
13 euro gives me 15gold. ( acording to gold selling sites.
---
250k retail gold is 15 classic gold.
---
Same. The AH flippers went to hard to soon and now the AH is dead. Bronze bars were going for 40s a stack till some “economics expert” bought them all and reposted for 2g a stack. They have just been sitting there for days. Who tf is gonna buy stuff that high right now?
---
&gt;w hen race change became available 
---
not in classic / vanilla, thats for sure !
---
So what was the reason then and how did you get unbanned?
---
No, no, you use Google to find the link to Wowhead.
---
on my server they're already going up. I think as you start having more high level people that want to spend a bit of money on fun items, you'll see them go up.
---
Also depends how many people grind them. I think on my server I have very little competition on the deviate market
---
Are you on a pvp server now? Does follow break when you enter pvp combat?
---
I'm on a pve server because I don't multibox to pvp, I do it to farm faster. So I can't test for myself.
---
I feel like if follow doesn't break on pvp in the world, then it won't be broken in bgs either.
---
Still too early to say anything.
---
Well yeah, sure, it's useful for you. But oftentimes it's 10x more useful on a rogue or a warrior. I think it's not too much to ask that you pass on this +5% damage boost when someone else in your group can get +20% from it. I'd gladly pass such a weapon as a hunter, and I'd ask the rogue to let me have this agility bow even if he can use the stats, because it's just much better on me.
---
The game is exactly the same as it was. You just have 15 years worth of experience playing the game now as opposed to back then in vanilla.  Just think about how many raid encounters you have done since then, with harder and harder mechanics. Considering you eventually learned these mechanics it makes sense that the first mechanics added in the game feel easy to do.
---
And collision is client side so you could remove walls and other obstacles, people have used it since vanilla both to exploit and just to get a cool looking character.
---
Did what ?
---
I’m not sure that constitutes a ”good catch” tbh, you should at least read your spell tooltips xD
---
Nope!
---
For the Alliance!
---
Get what you want, it won't really matter. You'll never be in a situation where the 1.0 speed saves you in a way that 1.2 or1.3 wouldn't because not a single fight you're going to be in is going to be fair. Even in duels there are huge gear advantages and class unbalances.
---
Eels? What's that for?
---
Maybe he is a gnome male.
---
On BFA and "Normal" Servers, yes. But until BFA i troduced Warmode, no. If you are on PvP or RPPvP servers you cannot have characters of both factions on one server.
---
Any success on finding a solution? I saw you got a reply from Blizzard about ipv6. Tried that myself, to no success.
---
Cheers mate, you’re a legend.
---
I dont think that its drop chance is that low, i saw 6 of them drop in a total of 8 Angerforge kills same for the Mara Ring. Or im just lucky too then maybe i will get both Rends in a drop :)
---
No, there is no honor and I don't expect a fair 1v1 duel in every interaction but I think I can feel kind of annoyed when people kill me 5v1 and then act all edgy as if it was some kind of achievement.
---
manual fishing while being AFK doing other things during lunch etc in the last few days. also some of those stacks I bought for cheap to cook them and resell them for profit
---
You Alliance scum
---
Cockmeat sandwhich* FTFY
---
But if they do with shaman they have:
---
\- autohit
---
\- mortal strike
---
\- sweeping strikes
---
\- cleave
---
\- whirlwind
---
\- bloodthirst if fury
---
\- HoJ/sword spec (?)
---
to trigger the windfury effect
---
Shamans have:
---
\- auto attack
---
\-stormstrike every 20seconds
---
That's rather entitled of you. Majority doesn't seem to be wanting what you want and you just have to deal with it. Don't be toxic, we don't owe you anything.
---
I personally don't care what you do with your files, and I won't enforce my personal opinions on you, but changing _any_ game files (or messing around with the game's RAM) is a critical offense against the TOS, and you can get banned for it any time.
---
There were countless ban waves for many popular model replacers in the past, and Blizz still is going the hardline approach here.
---
Hunter rezzes at spirit healer straight away, hearths. Then rezzes pet and feeds.
---
Pet can't run away in the first 30 minutes; it's almost like someone at blizzard thought of this.
---
afaik all pve servers are heavily biased to ali
---
I know this might be the wrong thing to take from this....
---
But the game is what 15 years old? Theres addons that make the already easy boss fights easier.
---
Some classes literally spam 1 button.
---
I get the frustration that someone cant do something so simple.
---
But still these guys sound like awful douches
---
i guess self promotion isnt outlawed in this sub
---
But  you can't fly straight to Teldrasil/Darnassus, the flight takes you through Aubedine first. Or is there a way to make it change path?
---
Wait what ? Higher speed = damage will be lower, at same dps values. What he's saying is you want a slow weapon with the highest dps so your sinister strikes hit for the most damage. There's no damage multiplier anywhere, if you have a fast main hander as a rogue, you're going to hit like a wet noodle.
---
Its like this in a lot of places, have been since the game launched, still happens sometimes on retail.
---
I played a warrior to 20, get bored. Played a warlock to 20, got bored.
---
Now I'm playing a rogue, just dinged 20 and I think this is the one.
---
The patrol starts as soon as you accept the quest. Abandon the quest, accept the quest again and run as fast as possible south where the road leaves the camp.
---
oh yeah this happens to me i'm in cat form i start to fight and i'm like ooooh... no buffs
---
Arathi
---
Yeah you are right, it's exalted. Quite difficult to achieve then. I remember doing it with an alt in the past, but I guess it was after the first patch where they increased the amount of rep that quests gave.
---
Hell yeah, look at all of those people who *didn't get kicked from their guild today because they didn't go to this*.
---
I thank you for your buffs but damn it slow down so I can AI you! You all are out of range before I can even find where the buff came from
---
" The game is exactly the same as it was. You just have 15 years worth of experience playing the game now as opposed to back then in vanilla. " I honestly call bull shit on that one, there is NO WAY, I would have survived 9 stacks of debuff on Golemagg. There is no way we would have killed Ragnaros with half the raid dead without a single P2, without any of us decked in Epics. No way our tank would have survived that fight with 160 RF and one piece Tier 1 gear. Knowledge and experience are one thing, rolling over content that easily is another entirely.
---
No MC was nerfed at 1.12 or right before that :-)
---
Most AH flippers gained their experience on pservers or on retail, were we didn't have the _completely new servers where nobody has any gold_ situation in years, so basically they are using the same prices
---
You can watch every streamer  do this over and over. It’s not bannable, people have been doing this since wow dropped. The only thing it does is skip the run from town.
---
Well he absolutely ruined his life and even got a crit on that.. but at least he annoyed people for a few minutes. Good tradeoff.. xD
---
The vast majority of players are still the the  late 10s and 20s. Yes, even after almost a month. Leveling starts slowing down massively by the time you reach the mid 40s and without knowing where to go next it feels like it goes down to a stop by the time you finish ungoro crater.
---
We are still pretty much in the honeymoon phase. Heck, even BFA was still more than lively at this point.
---
The little piggie behind the hunter is a great touch!
---
This person was communicating an idea. The method they chose was 100% successful. How is the picture quality relevant?
---
(repost: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6lzrj/feign\_death\_being\_looked\_at\_woot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6lzrj/feign_death_being_looked_at_woot/) )
---
Funny mine is also wow related, but every once in a while it'll hit me and I just have to say it, "No dude, I want the blue staff." Although I never forgot what it's from (Jimmy: The World of Warcraft story), I don't understand why I think of that sentence so often lmao
---
Feel free to be annoyed, or want revenge - in fact thats what im getting at being the positive, it fuels more PVP.
---
The post was more directed at the people upholding that there's some sort of *'code of honor'*  that completely bars these sorts of activities.
---
Just point out there isn't any unspoken rules, it's all fair game - play how you want its a video game..
---
Without Ironfoe its not the same..
---
Sick, dude
---
Two bags. That's nice and all, but what would've been better was a print screen button.
---
Why is it "interesting" that they followed up on this?
---
This idiot caused severe financial damage (yes, server outages are financial damage). It was a criminal act. Why wouldn't they follow up on it? :D
---
It'll change once honor kicks in, if you're not done leveling by then you'll get ambushed everytime you go below 70% health.
---
Old and lame joke. Both ways.
---
It's rough, cloth turn ins might be needed. Cant remember if pvp Marks quests give faction rep or just bg rep
---
Blacksmithing? Do I miss something?
---
You know more about the bosses than me back in the day and we cleared it weekly aswell! Dont think it was ever hard
---
"Private server elitism wont be in Classic."
---
Yeah how'd that dream vision go for people?
---
This is some straight up frat-boy shit lmao.
---
Looks exactly like my UI did 15 years ago. Pretty much just bartender.
---
"may"
---
I don't know much about hunters. What was the purpose of permanently abandoning your pet? Why couldn't he just walk around the trap?
---
Surprised no one has said this, but in instances where mobs flee, pay attention when your pet is attacking them and you have to switch your pet to passive or it will follow and agg more mobs. I have pet attack bound to forward mouse wheel and pet passive bound to backward mouse wheel. So right as a mob gets to low health I either send it to the next or pull it back to me.
---
If you play dead by daylight and you actively try to play as the killer.
---
Your probably a serial killer irl btw.
---
&gt;Dude you are wagging your finger in my face so hard I can barely read your response, firstly by continuously implying that I am the embodiment of all that is wrong with the game- stop doing that, it's annoying.
---
I didn't aim my first comment at you. You came to me and had to tell me how wrong I was. So don't give me that shit as if I'm laying the world's problems at your feet...I didn't even think about you before you decided that what I was saying was an insult to you. Sorry pal, the world doesn't revolve around you. 
---
&gt;I don't aoe everything, and I sure as fuck don't just ignore my tank, faceroll everything and cause wipes. And I'm not the only one, every other mage I've played with has been absolutely fine.
---
Then why are you getting insulted then?
---
&gt;And I'm not the only one, every other mage I've played with has been absolutely fine. With regards to drinking, it is by far the biggest weakness of a mage in a dungeon. Even if I top rank frostbolted every pull, I'd be drinking after 80% of them. We use a load of mana, not our fault.
---
You can always use a weaker spell to save mana. It's not my fault you prefer to count damage per second instead of damage per mana.
---
&gt;My point is, stop fuelling this circle jerk stemming from aoe farming and definitely don't expect mages to stop using aoe.
---
What part of "it's not that they can't, it's that they won't" makes you think I don't understand this sentence?
---
&gt;If we played together we would get on just fine, my point was never that I want mages to fuck around and make stuff hard on purpose.
---
Well, three posts ago you opened with "So effin what, jesus." Now you're being all nice and carrying yourself with professionalism? Maybe I should lump you in with all the mages...they typically stop fucking around and play the game well after the third or fourth wipe too.
---
&gt;I would guess (might be wrong so sorry if so) you can be a pretty critical tank, complaining about mistakes - 
---
You're the one who went out of your way to give me a piece of your mind directly. Don't cry when I give you a piece back.
---
&gt;but I'd be amazed if everyone just kept ignoring you if you spoke kindly with regards to your desired play style. And if they do, just block them. 
---
Yeah, you think I'm mean to everybody because I'm mean to you. Well, there's something you're missing. 
---
Other people don't introduce themselves to me by pissing on my opinion and outright expecting me to take their opinion as "better".
---
What's the matter, first time you ever met a WoW player who stood up for himself?
---
Finally make it fishable, just like it was originally intended to
---
Maybe a South Sea isle continent to make the port in Tanaris actually used for something. The South Sea should be full of Pirates, not Pandas.
---
Not hating on the Pandas but they should've been placed in the Veiled Sea.
---
Lots of potential for Classic+
---
alliance hunters get all they want.
---
That's just because you don't see horde doing it \^\^
---
Or is resisted as is my experience trying to cast fear in PvP haha.
---
I thought you meant that you can actually see herbs lol
---
And you pull numbers out of your ass 95% of the time.
---
But we're discussing leveling weapons, not endgame weapons? Just because its higher level doesnt mean its better either, as you just pointed out yourself. The only thing that matters is top damage (the damage range of the weapon since you didnt know what I was talking about)
---
Sadly this is what addiction looks like, not really cool.
---
Altaholism is setting in for me. So I came up with criteria that I liked to try and pick a class.
---
-alliance preferred, but if shaman is perfect I'd pick it
---
-love tanking and healing, bored by dps
---
-mechanically not the best player, not a big fan of hugely complex play mechanics/rotations/million-spell classes
---
-like to play a "needed" class.
---
-prefer survivable classes
---
-no real interest in PvP
---
Given these criteria, any recommendation on class?
---
Leveling on my Warlock: fear never breaks.. which causes the mobs to run into other mobs and pull more :D
---
Ah, got it. To me they're just quite different genres.
---
I couldn't possibly play any of those AFK games.. When I tried mobile games in the past (have since given up on it), I remember starting to like the gameplay, as it got a little more complex, then suddenly... an auto play button appears, and I just uninstalled.
---
Rather motley bunch, that.
---
HA...HAHAHA...What a stooge!
---
Well, yes. Most people don't level as MM and therefore don't have access to Aimed Shot until level 51.
---
I'm sure that at least one of the reasons it's not an option, is to not give an unfair advantage to some players. If player A can see entities 50y away, and player B can only see entities 25y away, player A obviously has an advantage.
---
Why are you saying this like all young men are fucking retarded?
---
It's very likely that your tooltips are just broken. Happens from time to time, remove you cache folder
---
Some spells get 100% of this boost, and some could get only 50-70%.  
---
Usually longer cast spells get the most, and instant cast - half.
---
Once a lvl 60 druid buffed my lvl warrior with Thorns. I felt like a killing machine
---
It only has to work on like two people to make money
---
Sounds good but doubt people will risk that lol
---
They have a long prep time tho so military maybe can attack if everyones drinkig after buffing 1 group
---
Start at 8pm to cater for the dads who’ve gotta put the kids to bed.
---
I wonder what country he was in... prison is gonna be fun for him
---
It is not unequivocal fairness to steal loot from people who need it. You never stop to consider that not all classes are created equally and not all classes can farm money as efficient as others.
---
Your logic almost always comes from Hunters, Mages, classes that are very good at generating gold out of thin air. Figures that the sociopaths that can only think in gold value would argue this line of thinking without a shred of irony.
---
If you need roll on Stockade Pauldrons when the tank actually needs them, you are a certified ninja looter and should be blacklisted from every guild on the server. You are not entitled to all pieces of loot just because you can flip them for currency. It is literally that simple.
---
I was so happy when I hit 30, fd + trap macro in 2 clicks could save me a lot of times. I also knew it's needed in some raids.
---
Was soooo sad when it didn't work like I was expecting (though my expectation came from private servers). I managed to make it work, but not all the time, and with the 400ms delay people talked about on the forums.
---
I hope this change will make it a bit more responsive. I play on a PvE server, so I'm not affected by pvp'ers, but I like to use it when fighting solo.
---
What? I didn't see anyone... haha
---
Look for green arms under the chat bubble
---
Must be some implied humor to this I'm not catching.
---
If it's in a contested zone  you should easily be able to get a posse from the opposite faction to hunt him down, people hate griefers.
---
I have been talking about the long term concern all along. This is why I said in my **first** reply to you in **direct response** to your comment on dead servers. 
---
&gt;My son plays on Earthfury. During primetime (same source as above) they get 3,000 players online so they never get a 2nd layer. If half of their players drop before Phase Two then that's still healthy but wouldn't you be getting worried at the trend? How much population loss would you expect on average over the next 2 years?
---
Absolutely sick!
---
got sapped just before getting on the boat in booty bay, the rogue vanished and i was left standing there missing the boat. 
---
Good times.
---
You seem like a piece of shit but not one that should be banned. It's a fkn pvp server.
---
Yeah, most of the people in this thread have zero idea that there are hundreds of different ways to cause a DDoS and still think that it's only botnets that flood servers forcefully. They don't think about exploits in network and server infrastructure that allow an attacker to DDoS without any extra connections. Code is code, you can cause crashes by figuring out where bugs are at. If you crash a server or core router, it's considered a denial of service. If you crash many servers/network equipment, it's considered DDoS. But nope, we'll pretend all DDoS attacks are kids renting Asian-ran botnets for a few bucks.
---
Wow, rude. (56 warrior)

Looking for some advice on my rogue [combat swords leveling/wPvP build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGe0oxZG0qbbVzxfo). Not sure if I'm missing out, not going for parry/risposte and improved slice and dice?

Not an animated series, sadly, but my first Patreon goal is "A Classic Journey" Issue #1 Comic Book. Description:  
---
The other group are brought together in the seemingly peaceful Elwynn Forest which shelters the mighty capital Stormwind City. But all is not well in the shining jewel of the Alliance as rumors have it that the king, Varian Wrynn, has gone missing.
---
They will learn that it is in time of peace that you must prepare for war.  
---
Keep your fingers crossed for me, guys!

All I can add here is this link to a (reuploaded) very old video that was very well made back in the day showing the associated quest "The Balance of Light and Darkness" that needs to be solo'ed to complete this quest line:

---
On EU-Perenolde I was the 6th or 7th wearer of this staff. Took me 3 attempts of the quest, but that was back in WoW 1.?? so quite a bit harder I presume than it is now.
---
&gt; Why would you ruin your entire life to inconvenience a few thousand people for a couple hours?
---
&gt; I just can't fathom that level of dumbassery
---
Not that different from regular crimes.
---
pvp isn’t supposed to be fair.
---
I’m not sure I’ve ever seen Faerlina, Herod, Stalagg and a couple others on low aside from when they were DDOS’d
---
Had a dude undercut me by 1g. From 1g 20s profit to 20s profit. Do you hate money?!
---
But I was just broke for a day. Now I'll just buy his shit and monopolise fire prot pots, yes-yes 😈
---
Love the part where he thinks "I'll just go run over here and stealth...". Faerie fire mofo
---
&gt; would like to avoid wpvp if possible.
---
That's not possible. All 30+ areas are mixed for Alliance\Horde.  
---
And it's better to do this in Eastern Kingdoms, because there will be more Alliance players in STV, Hillsbrand. Desolace is too far away from Alliance bases, so usually there's more Horde players.
---
Oh god I'm so glad I'm not the only one that thought this.
---
lol you should literally never be giving away ranged weapons in classic with the exception of gorewood and blackcrow. If you're going to do that, why even bother rolling hunter? If anyone is seriously going to bash a *hunter* for rolling on an *agility bow* they can straight go fuck themselves.
---
&gt; It took away from the appeal of having a unique pet.
---
I get the argument, but it doesn't really work when the end result is everyone using the blandest, same lion model in the game.
---
idd
---
Just keep your fingers crossed, mate! :D
---
Finish last quests in Redridge and go into Duskwood.

UK based guilds. Where are we all at? Me and my group of friends are on Netgergate Keep (but not married to it) and would like to find a group (we're all in our late 20s, early 30s) to quest with and maybe raid someday in the future. We're pretty casuals players, an hour or two here and there a few times a week, maybe a bit longer on Friday nights/WEs.
---
 Never been so stressed seeing ~~alliance players~~ a pet  abandonment in my life.
---
(I luv this little guy, which can pull mob from affar with its swift bolt)
---
I've seen a lot of movies where they keep it in the glove compartment.
---
Got behind the portal. You have to glitch your way under Stormwind and then jump at certain spots to get there
---
I like that looting frame what's that?
---
How is that ruining the AH? Just post your own at a reasonable price
---
I'm level 51 and have given up on traps all together. It's too frustrating
---
Obviously, they are. You compete for quest mobs, having upper hand in profession leveling, spot in a dungeon group, etc. By design, your faction is your natural enemy, as long as honor isn't introduced.
---
You mean it flies past auberdine to Teldrassil? Because that is how flights work in vanilla.
---
Most people didn't sign up early for names.
---
whats his twitter?
---
&gt;heal 5 mans reliably
---
Being the only healer without a resurrect really hurts here. I used to have engi with cables XL to have a second res on a 30 min CD in Vanilla. Still it made many a Scholo run harder than it would have been for a pala/shaman/priest.
---
It's gonna be significantly better from 30 (get the WW axe asap) and 40 so don't give up.
---
Race change was added in Wrath. So 5 years from now you’ll be able to do it.
---
As someone who spends a lot of time on lowbie toons...

A lot of us have it coming.

Why are you all the way in the North Pole if you’re not a penguin
---
is the rename function bugged for rares pets?
---
I got the rake and cant rename him, he is permanently "cat"
---
I played on a dead realm for years, I'm NEVER going back to that.
---
Our realm choice went Gehennas &gt; Firemaw &gt; Mograine &gt; Stonespine. Mograine is fine now but I'm quite content with Stonespine, it's mostly high and sometimes full without queue.
---
Why not?  I don’t understand what’s off about it.
---
January 25, 2005.  Says so right in the file name!  Never played on a private server.

Yeah but I'm sure the punishment is probably a little extreme for the damage caused.

" i thought you guys had phones"
---
That's what I thought, but not really. I'm on Stalaag and it drops to almost nothing after 11 or 12
---
I really like wow. But, the more I play the more I'm seeing thay blizzards auto ban, auto report system shouldn't be automated. It should not be automated. Not automated. This is 100 percent solvable in game, or like others have said... We not getting full story.
---
I think I've dedicated a third of my life in the past 12 days to Classic
---
Did u change spec perchance?
---
Given two comparable weapon setups I'd trade 3 or 4 agi for a hard hitting 2 hander easily, especially on a PvP server.  The damage difference between a 2h raptor strike and dw is hugely larger than the .8 DPS increase that 6 AP gives you. All you need to do is raptor strike a mob as you're running up to loot it and you've increased your farming efficiency.

3mage dps would better reflect current classic groups. :p
---
Awesome picture
---
Yes, night elves are racist. But Druids more or less stand above this more often than not. That's why druids of opposite factions usually don't fight each other. They live for the same purpose.
---
For leveling SnD and Ruthlessness are both good. Sword specialisation is not, that one auto-attack extra every 20th attack makes no difference during leveling compared to Ruthlessness and the reliability of SnD. Did someone tell you to put points to it?
---
HID scanner from 3-5 ft away.
---
"Fitting"

;)
---
Hunters are awesome and I've not had any issues finding a group.
---
When another hunter is in the same group though... loot squabbles
---
Outgunned.
---
It isn't always that clear my dude. I've received a few bans in my time playing this game. Some very well deserved. Some I'm still wondering what I was even banned for.
---
DAE &lt;Dads Who Game&gt; TOO? I LOVE PLAYING RPG GAMES EVEN THOUGH I'M A DAD.
---
Is this being the new vegan? Is it possible to not mention it?
---
Even if you are leveling as fury then you should use a 2h because you don’t have enough +hit to justify dual wielding with equally good weapons.
---
[Twitter screen shots](https://esports-news.co.uk/2019/09/20/twitter-suspends-account-claiming-responsibility-for-wow-ddos-attack/)
---
The whole spell cleave meta has really put a damper on the classic experience for a lot of people I feel. Single target DPS are really feeling the burn, healers are working overtime to keep the groups up, and the proper tanks are being questioned why their DPS is so low. 
---
I feel like a large part of the people that have partook in this activity never experienced vanilla wow. For me the nostalgia doing all the instances the game has to offer even the odd ones and questing in the less popular zones.
---
Sure 60 is just now coming for me (Hopefully today 59.4 atm) but the group of people I am dungeons and running with is solid. I have proper tank and a proper set of DPS and we are crushing 5 mans. Playing as the healer the challenge is there in the right way. 99% of the time im healing the tank with a few small renews on my DPS but then there is the awkward pat, the runner, or RNG fighting against us. Then it's down to every last bit of mana keeping them alive. Using my whole toolkit instead of 1-2 skills.
---
Ultimately it just feels right. It feels like 2004. Nothing has compared and I find myself completing my "adult" tasks ASAP to get back into the game. It's not the fastest paced game play but every +1 in tradeskills or bubble of experience is so rewarding.
---
I think he's talking about where these guys are: https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=672/skullsplitter-spiritchaser
---
They didn't take any code from the original, let alone nost code, that, if you don't know, was based on mangos (opensource emulator released under a GPL license).
---
What they did is taking all the original data and models and make them work into the modern software (legion was the base when they started).
---
They also put the original code (server and client) on an internal machine to use as a reference to investigate bugs and differences in behaviour.
---
Their groups, their rules.
---
&gt; but it seems like only mages and tanks are in high demand for groups atm
---
... which is a improvement over vanilla, where only tanks were in demand
---
I used to play with some friends in NA (I'm EU) and didn't really noticed much difference. So in theory it should be o.k.
---
Maybe hes a pornstar?
---
I also see this LFG ad as the guy needing 2 more, a mage and a healer, not 2 mages and a healer
---
Yea its weird what stuff gets stuck in our heads!
---
Got feared and ran literally from MC port dude to ramp and then to lava, seems good...
---
I'm horde, but honestly, NE is the min/max priest on a pvp server.
---
You can "shadowmeld, mind control to lave" at the chain in black mountain. So much better than fear ward.
---
Tab out to discord, the plus is you can use this while offline, which you cant do with an addon
---
Nothing is going to change if I leveled slow or if I leveled fast, and actually my experience would be worse if I leveled slow.
---
Sorry that I dont think I need to "relive" a journey I've already made by making it excruciatingly slow
---
Mages make the dungeon a lot easier.
---
Mr.burns, youre evil
---
Replace it with a green or try and farm something froma dungeon. I had fun farming the epic 2hander from ZF.
---
This is an outrage!
---
Sure, and thanks!
---
Huh. I'll have to look into it when they open up paid transfers then
---
Plus its 5g for the second slot. Personally thats too much pre 40.
---
I prefer to trade a finished product for materials + tips if possible.
---
badass af, loving the skeleton on the rock spike
---
My total played is inflated because I did a lot of remote desktop logins to skip the queue and then sat in IF waiting for 3 hours to find a tank to pug dungeons.
---
And I drive an electric car.
---
And I don’t have Facebook.
---
And I won money on the Grand National.
---
warr clearly needs to git gud
---
This was never a thing in vanilla or private servers. I don’t understand how Classic can be this different.
---
I have zero knowledge of what the kid chose to do in his attack. 
---
However there are multiple methods you can use even as a solo or a few computers. 
---
IE look up a Slow Lorice Attack, apart from being my favourite name of anything, its pretty effective.
---
Hey, thank you for letting me know. I will look into it. &lt;3
---
Pretty sure it’s hunter/lock only
---
No re
---
This is not a discussion, this is you shilling your youtube channel.
---
Also this has been discussed and even acknowledged by Blizzard at this time.
---
"Is THIS a out of season April fool's joke?"
---
Someone make an addon pls
---
If you think bossfights only last 30 seconds I've got some bad new for you friend...
---
100% pally lol
---
Someone might already have suggested it but a minimalise feature would really improve it, cause no need to have it take up screen time when not using
---
We will also look at this story differently in a couple of decades where all drugs are legal and we give up this idiotic war on drugs.
---
When you mace yourself on the head so hard that you fart out your peen.
---
My legit posts of content always getting deleted. These scrubs post pictures of cats and get approved? Wtf?!
---
Yes because the key to avoiding burnout is to make dungeons last as long as possible for no reason other than "I did this in 2004 therefore it's the only way of doing it"
---
Don't care, honestly. You can put your group together how you want.
---
Warrior probably. Its the most needed class, can tank, is the most durable because plate armor and you dont have to pvp if you dont want to i guess. Idk about complexity though never played warrior before
---
have you ever heared of the stanford prison experiment. thats exactly how you behave my friend.
---
People who signed up early for names are unlikely to be tourists.
---
It’s the people that bought a month to check it out who’ll be dropping off.
---
The wolves from LBRS are the best pbe dps pet in the game
---
I might be mistaken but I think paid transfers only work per region. If you wanted to play on a different region, you would have to make a new account. Don't quote me on that, but I think that's how it works. - You could always test a trial account out and see how the latency is.
---
&gt; This is the best part of the raid
---
The sage of raids. Enjoy the social breakdown.
---
The *reasons* are the same, yeah. Understand it or not, mob mentality is a big issue with redditors.
---
How many of you are there? I’m running a casual guild on that server currently it’s just all real life friends, all between 20/30 age, want to raid in the future but nothing serious
---
/w Coulston in game at some point I’ll be on later this eve
---
Nah, just waiting for TBC. Glory days.
---
Oh my fucking god "no dude... I want the blue staff." I need to go re-watch it
---
"some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."
---
According to wowpedia:
---
&gt;Deadmines's Outland is an unofficial name used to refer the unnamed closed zone that exists underneath the Deadmines. It is believed to be the original testing ground for Outland.
---
I thought that i should have made the title "lightning fart"
---
i'm a warlock and i get refered to as "purple mage" sometimes.. can i play the victim card?
---
For leveling ruthlessness and SnD are utterly useless. You should never use SnD on non elite mobs because it’s just a waste. Sword spec is a much better talent.
---
No, tame The Rake or Broken Tooth if you want unique stats, LBRS worg for the only howl 6 in the game.
---
If you are uncertain just tame him and experiment. I have no idea.
---
3. Yes. A proc from say sinister strike resets the swing timer. So you need to time abilities at the end of each swing to prevent clipping into auto attacks too much.
---
if someone is looking to form a group, they'll ask for what they want.  Maybe they are a hunter or a rogue, so dont want competition for the same gear, so asking for a mage to make the run easier.
---
Female troll.
---
Lupos shadow damage was fixed in 1.9 so in Classic it does regular damage.
---
Fucking nelves
---
yeah, but if im forming a group, i can make my ideal group right ?  
---
For instance, i dont want any roll competition as an hunter, i dont invite another hunter.  
---
If i want food , or lots of AOE i'll get an mage...  
---
You make the group, you make the rules.  
---
And the current meta seems to be alot of Mages and their AOE
---
no, it has nothing to do with accepting the quest.
---
You either win or you lose. 50/50
---
So like this post was cool until you added the final line. Now you just come across as a douche.
---
Its ironic you say that because warlocks were still insanely scary in tbc, probably more so but i havent seen how good locks are in classic yet. Wasnt until towards the end of tbc's lifespan when they got handicapped through the addition of melee having armor pen.
---
Hunters are required for MC at least.
---
bless your heart
---
Most definitely. We've already made a point of telling folks in pugs that if they have one specific but very important job for the fight (Mages for Lucifron, Locks for Garr), that they shouldn't even be dps'ing and just focus on that sole mechanic. And to no surprise, the boss automatically goes down when that happens.
---
And they think you're hilarious for "regular" leveling. It is just at which angle you look at it, some people don't like to walk around in a zone and questing but would rather see the xp flowing. Different people enjoy different things.
---
This was my plan until I saw they sold for 20s a stack
---
Scarlet Monastery.
---
I hope you see there is place between 10 years in prison and 500$.
---
Contextually, he said millennials in a game filled with people aged 20-40 which are all millennials. You’re the one that is building a straw man argument because you’re assuming information you can’t confirm.
---
I killed a fella there today
---
Well the child here is supposed to be "extraordinarily attractive"
---
It's just a lot of addons and a tidy UI for not even 3 months after the game was released.
---
I didn't start working on my UI until I was way into level 60 and even then it was nowhere near as clean or modern as yours is here. Even looking at the old school PvP videos and it's roughly around 2006 when some of them started cleaning up their interfaces.
---
Well if you are asking then ur leveling, improved eviscerate is usefull but ruthlessness not as much as the mobs die to quickly, same with Slice n Dice. Murder is always good with 2% damage increase. Sword spec isnt good for leveling. 
---
So go Combat tree down to Adrenaline Rush then start put points into Assassination tree. Would start with Malice-&gt;Murder-&gt;Improved Eviscerate or Ruthlessness-&gt;Relentless Strike and Lethality.
---
It helped finance my mount too :)
---
If you are horde, sell them in Booty Bay. You get a better price at the neutral AH
---
I cleanse anyone with poison or disease on them as I walk past.
---
I was a warrior back in the day, and I know the pain.  
---
Now for some reason I'm playing a paladin bonking stuff into the ground with autos.
---
Nice pserver
---
The twelve-gauge double-barreled Remington, S-Mart's top of the line.
---
Is it the highest of the kitty cats or what?
---
lmao pretty much
---
should be in settings - the options is under a scroll down options where you can chose between showing only numbers, % or both.
---
Like I already said, sociopath. It's pointless to keep replying because you will thankfully always be in the minority and morally wrong. I just wished this kind of mentality stayed more in retail, but that's where we are now I guess.
---
Priest fear usually breaks when touching a slightl, tougher blade of grass.
---
do you play on fairbanks? someone in my guild has the same name
---
Well the correct answer is Ruthlessness, SnD and Sword spec isnt good for leveling.
---
Has there been any prove, that it was actually the real attacker? Anybody can make a twitter account and brag about things, that they didn't do, just to annoy people.
---
Will do haha thanks!
---
God damn Emily and MMK
---
Yes, how does it help? Enchanter with 4g at level 37, please help. I’m a broke warrior.
---
SpartanUI
---
Isn't succu still invis while casting?
---
I actually did figure it out last night! Got it recording/streaming at a smooth 60 FPS.
---
I tweaked lots of settings to get it working nicely but there was one thing that made a huge difference. I'm not sure if this will work for you but it's worth trying.
---
For me, if I play wow in windowed mode I get a smooth 60 FPS, but if I play in fullscreen I sometimes get frame drops etc. I was recording in OBS with the Source set to Window Capture (and set to the WoW window obviously), but could never get it to be above around 30fps. Eventually I tried with "Display Capture" and everything was much smoother. I then cropped the fullscreen capture so that it only records the WoW window. 
---
Other possibly important settings were: downscaling the output resolution to 720p, bitrate "4500", keyframe interval "2", cpu usage preset "superfast", profile "main".
---
Hope this helps and you get it working.
---
You can flag for pvp on a pve server. So if u are both flagged on the  boat yes.  So no to answer your question. But  a lot easier to do on a pvp
---
&gt;Forgot about shamans
---
We're used to that by now.
---
I am like you. That's why I'm on reddit and talk about games in awesomes subreddit like r/classicwow  
---
Theses communities are full of nice people who only want to share their passion and experiences in games.  
---
I have a lot of friends but none of them really interested in gaming.  I would really like to have an IRL friend who is as passionate as I am about video games to talk, see and do something cool like VR escape games or conventions.
---
All horde mate, there’s about 20 of us that play atm more some then others, ranging in levels from 10-50 few of us have alts also
---
I'm still working on my warrior, but was wondering if mixing piercing howl into tanking is viable or useful?  I love the idea of having an aoe slow for kiting mobs, but end level guides I've seen never have it.  I was sort of thinking of going mainly as dps in raid and tanking 5 mans to help gear guildies.  I don't want to raid tank just because I would feel obligated to stick with it even if I get bored months down the line and would hate to have them gear me up just for me to leave.  I also love to pvp and wanted to try it with warrior and piercing howl sounded awesome for that.  Anyways any thoughts on this?
---
Elkanos buff bars if you're looking to replace the default buff icons with something you can place wherever you want.
---
Voice was annoying,  I stopped watching immediately.
---
Just another pickpocketing spot...
---
Does the spell reflector for engineering work on fear?
---
Yeah the transition in RPG games from hardcore to slightly more casual (dice rolls are hidden, more action) will be, in my opinion, the peak of video games. It's gone way too far into action now such that it feels like most games play themselves. WoW was designed during this transition period by a bunch of DnD and MMO fans; pretty much the perfect group to take the good things that existed from both and synthesize them with the Warcraft universe.
---
What a fcking noob
---
I NEED TO GET CLOSER
---
Michael here
---
Yep, at least half the time it gets broken instantly. Guess I'm face tanking now.
---
True. Went questing in Hillsbrad yesterday and had to ping-pong between Tarren's Mill and the town for slaughtering all the 'poor' humans and handing in quests.
---
For one of the quests you have to pick up this book in the townhall. I thought I did (was questing with two fellow Tauren druids) until I noticed back in TM that I didn't. Back to the townhall we went - and, amazingly - nobody complained.
---
The community in general is sooo much more relaxed that it is in retail - maybe because the average gamer is older, has family and a so-called 'real life'?
---
Extended travel times also make you cool down between questing which imo also helps with taking it all in so much more easy and making you much more relaxed.
---
It's okay to not like the game. Doesn't sound like this is for you.
---
I started playing WoW on-off from MoP so I am pretty much a tourist.
---
I like classic because its more challenging and interesting than retail, and the world aspect is strong, all the usual except for the nostalgia. Less lore/gamebloat also means its more accessible 
---
However I've noticed that the class balance is crap which means that even though with all the talents etc. Designed so that you can customize your class to your preferred playstyle, in reality its just an illusion. Which basically means that if you dont select the specs that work you are going to have a crappy time. Also classes are pigeonholed into specific roles because of this.
---
Overall I enjoy classic, and after my friends are done with it, if we still feel like it we might migrate to retail for a while since I dont personally think classic+ or DLC to classic is a realistic scenario that will happen.
---
I love this. "uuuu let me be edgy and DDOS the severes, uuu i have nothing better to do". Dont drop the soap buddy boy, or should i say butty boy :)
---
well yeah have fun drinking for 2000 hrs  mr Omad1712 better quote Asmongold more and play your warri than talking about Mage statpriority
---
tbh you should be using a lot of expose armor against any melee type mobs. Against casters you don't need to.
---
Otherwise I agree that slice and dice is weak, 35 second buff from 5 combo points when you do not chain pull = very low value. In dungeons ofc it has huge value.
---
Gamers...
---
is this actually against the rules and is bannable? where is the line drawn then if thats the case?
---
To be fair, the German servers have noticed a pretty significant decrease in player numbers. That being said, once layering is gone it's probably all gonna be full again :D
---
That horde bias tho.
---
My /played to get to 60 is going to be slower this time than it was the first time. But I'm going to hit 60 with maxed fishing, first aid, cooking, mining and blacksmithing. (mining and blacksmithing are big maybes, but they are already 250+, so, close enough).
---
/played 0 obviously lol
---
I feel like he pretty much already has, since he was the guy who announced it/talked about it first.  That being said, yeah, I expect a lot more of it (and with more enthusiasm) this go around.
---
Only if you are the legal guardian. And you can only share it with 1 minor. [Source](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/13961)
---
&gt;camping inn consistently (no guards)
---
pvping in guardless areas is bannable?
---
There's not fair and then their's beyond broken.
---
I stay awake for other reasons. I lost my father recently, he was basically killed by a nurse's negligence. He would be 70 now, we used to raid together in wow, pvped together, gamed together since 1982. 
---
But WoW was special for both of us and he was really looking forward to classic WoW. 
---
And I avoid sleep because I dream of him every night, very bad dreams.

*cousin spends $2k+ (or whatever the actual price is) on season tickets to his favorite team*

I missed 40 Man Pugs just for this reason! Biggest Clown Fiestas on Earth! :D

Hi,
---
I can try to answer some of your questions.
---
1. Do every quest you can in BRD, probably farm BRD since you like this sort of leveling.
---
2. I m not sure he'll ever bite if you have claw, I'd not use bite at all really.
---
3. taunt when you are solo or if you want him to tank something, don't taunt if someone else is taunting, it gives more dps since it has more focus for claw.
---
4. I m not sure about this, maybe skin every mob you find, sell the leathers. Grinding mobs gives items, if you get gray weapons, you get like 1-2 gold.
---
5. I usually autoshot, aimed, auto, multi, auto, auto, aimed, repeat. But now, I am trying to get close to the mob and weave a raptor strike between the last 2 autoshots. This is why I use a 2hander. Might be fun/funny/efficient to do this in raids if you have a shaman with windfury.
---
6. Depends on your clear speed, I usually put the pet on one mob, send it to the next when the first is on low hp, and I finish it off. Do this until the pet is low hp, regen his hp, continue.
---
7. BRD for sure; as a weapon, there's one in stratholme, Peacemaker I think, pretty good with 56 ap and 1 crit. There's a 20 ap/1hit trinket you can get in the hinterlands by killing turtles, hope you have it already, if not, get it.
---
8. It depends on taste, he's the best for pvp, but if you don't pvp (like me), you can use other pets. I'll probably use a cat too, but I don't like broken tooth's model. Maybe you'll enjoy a wolf with the howl ability, which also buffs allies. Maybe you want a wind serpent which has an ability that does nature damage (bypasses armor). Maybe you like dinosaurs (same dps as cats). In raids, your pet will probaly not get heals (unless chain heal hits it), so I would not rely on it too much.
---
9. Resupply your arrows/bullets often, make macros for the pet to attack and to come back. Also feign death + trap macro (fd will be looked at since it does not work so well). You can also download a weapon swing timer if you want, but I didn't like it. Use your cooldowns (rapid fire, berserking if troll). Bind your wing clip so you can kite mobs if you take aggro. Winter is coming, so I think you will be able to fish Winter Squid for that +10 agi food buff. Level up first aid if you can, you'll need it in raids. There is a lot more stuff to be said, but you'll be fine with this :)
---
Yeah but I’m a mage and mages aren’t gear dependent!!! ;)
---
Sweeet. Definitely up for joining. Are you lacking any particular roles? Or is it just whatever
---
indeed
---
Karold and Humar go to Thousand Needles
---
No, it was smaller than my house key. Satan ripped me off.
---
Have you been banned before? Because you get longer bans if you have been banned before.
---
&gt;tame him and experiment. I have
---
Thank you a lot! Have been thinking about the fact that i might be wasting opportunity to calmly level a needed pet, but seems to be not the case!
---
It's &lt;APES&gt;, the guild that cleared MC world first.
---
How's it bugged?
---
I’ve remember numerous 5 hour slogs through this and I’ve still never finished the place
---
They could also add in more professions (or extend them), add races, new classes, more zones to explore etc etc. Don't need expansions. And it doesn't create a power creep.
---
Oh man, trying to work from home is the worst.
---
Orb of deception
---
Is it still possible to mind control those owl beasts and tease players with that?
---
There was a Molten Core LFR, people wiped on that too.
---
That "young person" brought it on themselves. Hopefully they won't be so stupid in the future.
---
That seems like all it takes lol. I was watching a stream of MC and it seemed like an exercise in coordination more than anything else.
---
Again with hyperbole.
---
Do you have an actual argument to make, or just made up quotes?
---
I appealed a ban and got unbanned during TBC. I think I did it trough battlenet.
---
I didn't even make an argument, what would they be disagreeing with? Funny coincidence a single person downvoted at same time as your reply lmao.
---
Just hit 30 on my priest and I typically buff when I think about it. It does cost at least 1/4 of my mana for each one though so if I'm not running far I sometimes won't.
---
Honestly mate whatever you want to play when we get to raiding eventually we will probably have to bring a few pugs in or people from other guilds anyway
---
Those month long suspensions aren't actual bans, but instead a preventable measure so the players can't send/sell their items. The bans will come later.
---
I mean you can and a lot of people have done that
---
you're not going to use a cat in raids, a lot of the time you just bring a wolf who stands at your side spamming howl because all the aoe otherwise will kill it.
---
I'm currently playing as a level 52 rogue. I won't lie, it's not always easy to find groups but if you're on a realm with high population, you just need to have a little bit of patience and you'll eventually find something. 
---
As for the spec - ofc I'm levelling as combat, and it's really good for levelling, but I'd also say it's pretty damn good in pvp as well. Yes, you won't have the same sort of utility spells/stuns/big one time crits as if you were specc'd as assassination or subtlety, but your damage is really high and sustainable. As you said, you already have a level 48 lock and I would assume you've managed to gather quite a nice amount of gold so far since you don't even need to buy a mount, so as long as you would use that gold to make sure you always have BIS weapons for your level (I bought a Bloodrazor at 44 for 25 gold and it was the best purchase ever), you will not have any problems in levelling/WPvP.
---
Yep. 1.0 attack speed.  Normal is 2.0 and next best is, IIRC, 1.2
---
This is not Classic. There is a Blood Elf so wrong sub dude.
---
Even though the rogue is the only one that can open it, he wouldn't be able to open it without the group being there killing all the mobs... So it's totally fair for everyone to roll. Greedy rogues are the worst.
---
Solid advice. I just bought it on a whim, assuming my s10+ was new enough to support it.
---
Are you guys alliance currently? I’ll get some bags and stuff sorted out for you all if you’re having to start fresh
---
I'm a bit confused. You say that they didn't take any code from the original, but that's redundant as you also say that they took the original data and models and made them work on modern software. Isn't the original data and the models (at their core) just code? Isn't taking that code, and putting it into modern software still the same as going over 15 year old code (when it comes to finding weird bugs)?
---
I have, but I do shift work and end up online during the 3 am to 6 am time bracket.
---
I remember people used to model edit the campfire into the dark portal. So you could make yourself a climbable object wherever.
---
True but saying "that's the original outland" is just speculation based on the file locations of the doodads used in the area, that name came about before the discovery of the alpha Outlands map. For all we know it's just the creation of a bored level designer.
---
Go earthfury !
---
Should the group roll for all herbs and mines too then?
---
Yeah! you are right. It's Prat 3.0!
---
Thats not my youtube channel o.o whats wrong with you?
---
I think wowhead actually does a nice job with its BRD guides. They divided it in two, including the quests which should help you get them all done efficiently.
---
Part 1 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackrock-depths-classic-dungeon-strategy](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackrock-depths-classic-dungeon-strategy) 
---
Part 2 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackrock-depths-brd-angerforge-emperor-classic-dungeon-strategy](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackrock-depths-brd-angerforge-emperor-classic-dungeon-strategy) ).
---
None of that is set in stone of course. Most likely the rest of your party will be trying to drag you in all sorts of directions for their own needs. But it's a start :)
---
I think the KILL ON SIGHT quests are the only ones where it makes sense to take a break to go to Thorium Point and back for the follow up as part of the same run. Both groups of trash are found on the less popular lower level. The second part in particular is for some more challenging packs found on the highway, which most groups don't have much reason to go to otherwise.
---
It creates a sequence of macros but how can I create one long macro?
---
Agreed, it was far from dead in TBC, but flying certainly was a factor in wPvP going down - with flying a great deal of hostile encounters could simply be dodged. I mean, look at Vanilla/Classic: no wonder that for ex. BRM saw so many battles, since it hosted numerous endgame instances/raids, and you had no other way to get there but to actually *ride* there, just as the opposing faction.
---
In BC you could get to most raids on a flying mount practically up front to the portal or land just a few yards away (SSC is a notable exception).
---
If you look at Quel'Danas, its a relatively small (crowded) area, no flying, and a bunch of endgame content - just like BRM.
---
To be clear: i'm not sying that wPVP was dead in TBC, or flying mounts killed it by itself, i'm just saying that it had role in it.
---
In my opinion its more like that all the "convenience" improvements (like the LFG system) and private instanced zones (garrisons) that actually killed it - you could easily access most of the endgame content (instances, raids, BGs, whatever) without leaving your capital city, hence zero chance to run int the opposing faction....
---
But i understood the joke thats why i added to it?
---
just run scarlet monastery farms and sell all greys / greens, put cloth onto the AH.... its pretty easy to make the mount money
---
lmao that's evil
---
lol this is Friends You Can Trust. I knew they were pieces of shit when their GM password locked the world chat channel a couple of weeks ago. 
---
These turbo nerds are so cringey lol
---
Not gotten to 60 yet. Teenage me would have had a character at 60 a week after launch.
---
Yep, over the next few weeks when people reach 60 there might only be two or three guilds raiding, would be great to have some more people to do stuff with.
---
Around brd is when I'm going to.
---
Players wanted a true vanilla experience. And in original vanilla, there were months of world PvP before BGs. Why would it be ok for you to have BGs out from start, but not have Naxx? It's the same logic.
---
As for layering, the amount of people asking for it is miniscule compared to everyone NOT asking for it. And blizz will remove layering because they expect some people to stop playing and server populations to stabilize.
---
I have 12 days played on my main lvl 60 mage. Got a few epics, epic mount and all my pre raid bis and all professions at 300, including cooking, first aid and fishing. Working on my lvl 52 shadowpriest at the moment.
---
Routine is sleep a little, play a lot. Sometimes shower and sometimes eat. I've lost 9kgs since launch.
---
LOL i’ll bet your a fun guy..
---
Noice
---
why is the part where he says it's tax not in the screenshot?
---
This is why naming and shaming and public blacklists are bad. People abuse them.
---
Make your own personal blacklist and don't listen to other people about who you should and shouldn't group up with.
---
The final boss is level 47, but the rest of the dungeon is 45 and under. I was in a group of all 42s and we definitely needed to pull the boss up the ramp to create enough time to kill him despite the 5 level difference.
---
It's actually not forced. Last I looked there was standalone auctioneer available,  and the 'suite' which you probably downloaded
---
1 - SnD does not proc of Ruthlessness.  
---
2 - Answer to ur question is Yes it does.  
---
3 - Yes.  
---
4 - Improved Sprint is always useful, you will spec in to imp SnD anyways if you are going Combat Sword or Combat Dagger for PvE.
---
Easiest way to do markers like skull and stuff. Can I put it on my hotbar or macro it to whatever I auto attack? Asking as a soon to be feral druid
---
&gt;There is phasing in classic right now, just like retail.
---
It's different to retail.
---
The feeling of emptiness in retail, to me, boils down to the lack of need for anyone to group up or be respectful to their neighbor, because they wont see them again. It's no better than a multiplayer game, where everyone just queues up and hops on the ride. 
---
Obviously seems to not be an issue for you, but then I'd argue we play the game for different reasons in the first place.
---
Use demo shout and battle shout, both let you gain threat as well as sweeping strikes and WW
---
Classic wasn't even out a few weeks back.
---
General settings or mobhealth settings do you know? Will have a look when I'm home
---
Considering the level curve puts lvl 44 at "half way", you aint even on track to do it within ten days! :D
---
Well you don't need eng to use death ray
---
Love the guy that undercuts to 86% market value when everything else is 110% and starts a chain reaction because “much quick sales” but that just fucks everything up and takes days for the market to reset
---
Is that from “floating wreckage” and you get a chest, with items inside?
---
There you go https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/bejeweled-classic/
---
see for me i get a massiv speed up around 45 since i just start killing mobs and doing dungeons to level up. in vanilla i did 50-56 in 3 days since everything just boiled down to kill these mobs they drop good shit that sells for a ton.
---
this is 100% wrong, SnD &gt; Evis in everyway.   
---
   
---
Evis is garbage damage
---
Yep, you have to learn how to kill without the destruction.
---
Imagine confusing a troll for a blood elf...
---
You can get thieves tools for free from a robot beside a goblin at Ratchet during the rogue class quest for the treasure, level 18-20?
---
Congratulations!!!
---
For someone chasing that enh dream, how much does being orc change your BiS? Do you think I could get a spot swinging Nightfall as a Troll?
---
I might sound dumb right now, but your screenshot just made me realize that classic is Region locked? Do i need a VPN if i want to play on a US Server from outside the US?
---
Impostor!
---
It’s the default UI with some sort of action bar mod and basically nothing else is changed from default.......
---
Gonna do that then. Thank you
---
it doesn't give you freedom to have fun meme names
---
it will be all mages and warriors with token warlocks and druids.
---
Whelp, I guess it's time for revolution
---
Si
---
Look at that asshole second right with his +25 agi enchant at lvl 13
---
As I said, our group was underlevelled as well ... all in our early 40s, too. I honestly don’t know what you want me to say. It’s possible ...
---
Why post this garbage seriously
---
Must've hurt. I recommend you talk to a professional about the death of your father. It's not healthy avoiding sleep due to bad dreams about it. You need to get help to cope with it.
---
Thanks! that’s actually a very useful psa
---
Uh oh he needed on a green boe watch out bois
---
I did, but as I wrote in other replies. I avoid sleep for a reason. And there are other reasons on top of the one that I wrote. I used to be rank 14 warrior back in the day, yeah I played a lot, but I worked from home and I could afford the time as I wasn't bankrupt like now. 
---
I didn't have son like now.
---
I didn't lose job and can't get a new one like now.
---
I had a father, who got killed by the criminal negligence of irresponsible nurse who doesn't give a fuck. 
---
Father who was also one of my best friends  - and a gamer. He would be 70 now and was really looking forward to classic. (way more than I did). 
---
Did I mention that my mom shut down, and  won't leave the bed no matter what I try to do?
---
Or that I am going through divorce, (not by choice). 
---
And that my wife got diagnosed with (thankfully benign but still fucking dangerous) brain tumor 2 months after she gave birth to our son.
---
Going trough divorce...
---
At least it doesn't slow your attack speed for 50% for 5 minutes, fuck that shit as warrior, 5 seconds between each attack.
---
He's not obligated to be friendly to every single person. 
---
"So much for the tolerant classic fans" lol
---
Actually there's a keybind for that.
---
holy shit
---
I'm tired of players like this. I always ress random people when I see a corpse and a lot of times I don't get any acknowledgement, they treat me like I'm an NPC or something.
---
Wow nail biter lol
---
Lmao imagine getting punished harder for this than a rapist. Strange rules
---
And then he has us kill the very thing that saved him from the Raptors! Some guys....
---
This subreddits /new is a leaky faucet from the brain fart department of noobs brains
---
i accidentally ninja'ed that chest already. I gave the stuff to the highest roller tho.
---
Report them
---
i did roll 1 yesterday
---
Jesus what’s happening on osrs now? I haven’t been keeping up since I’m playing classic as a break lol
---
It is a blast :) but people need to know how to work with you. As allways. Could also say it should work with phase 1 raids. You just need better gear and more time to farm for (mana) potions. And thats the thing. A warrior can allways say, yeah lets fuck it, put on some shild and 1hand sword and he is rdy to (off)tank if he has some gear. Prot pala not so much :|
---
Chill
---
Yep this is where I’m at too, I like things about every class and it makes it hard to choose.
---
A lot of lvl 60 players in your guild? So what, you basically said you have given up trying to compete and play leisurely few hours there and there when you have time. That is the solution, stop trying to compete with the others, and play with your own pace. I'm only lvl 38 and I started to play on launch week, lots of lvl 60s in my guild doing raids n shit, I don't even have a mount yet. And know what? I don't give a rats ass about it. I just play when I feel like it, some days I don't even log in even when I have the time..just take it easy, its a game not your life goal, in 10 years it doesn't even matter anyomore. Live your life, wow is just a way to kill your time.
---
My team reaching an invaluable away draw vs. Espanyol in the Europa League while I'm doing God's work in Azeroth. Multitasking Lok'tar Ogar
---
It actually isn't... At all. Nowhere on the rules and plenty of people post pics with names in them..
---
I also agree with this solution, but it has an issue:
---
If max/higher level players are much stronger, then for them it would feel like there's no interaction with lower level players since they oneshot them (literally oneshot), and for low level players it would feel very annoying. However if max level players aren't significantly stronger than lower level players (like in classic, for example, two lv40 can kill one lv60 if they try and get an opening first), then it would reduce the effect of being rewarded for gearing at max level. The latter is very much the case in GW2, where you can just buy epic gear for 2-4g tops and your next upgrade takes months to craft (or to grind enough gold to buy it) and only gives you like 5% more power from your epic gear. This feels like shit honestly.
---
yesterday I was in a dungeon as a slightly underleveled priest, but I was assured we'd just give it a shot.  
---
later half of the dungeon it gets really hard for me as I keep spending all my mana on every pull and the tank just doesn't let me drink.  
---
A couple tank deaths later after I told them to take it slower they got pretty angry at me even though they were fully aware I was underleveled and fighting for my life.
---
Later in another fight I die because tank couldn't keep aggro and all I get is "they resisted taunt"
---
well maybe your dead corpse will also resist my rez and you'll have to walk back :V
---
They're in keybindings under "Target Markers", or you can use a macro with the "/tm 1-8" command, in which case you can have multiple different icons like:
---
/tm [modifier:shift] 6; [modifier:alt] 7; 8
---
This command will put skull on a click, square on a shift click, and cross on an alt click.
---
OP isn't even a really active part of this subs community. He just uses the sub as advertisement place for his twitch. And then it is not even a fun clip to look at. Congrats on ghostwolfing to gank a lowie guy with add aggro.
---
Damn.. considering this change was made after the fear-breaking trinkets were in game, I feel justified in feeling like fear is just too strong at the moment. 
---
Hard to complain, considering I play rogue, but still :D
---
My attributes are way less that 22 anyway...
---
I’d have waited for you to tame it, type /clap then kill you while you at 50% life. For the Horde
---
I also had this, but I've never heard of "Stock UI". I'd love to get the same unit frames now.
---
You significantly overestimate the number of people who subscribed far in advance of the launch date purely to reserve a character name.
---
You have to understand he gets no attention from people in his life and he desperately needs validation.
---
You handled it fairly well.  Most would have immediately jumped down his throat.  If I was left in that group I would've hearthed.
---
Still waiting for the day when I get finally banned for my fishing bot. Too bad Blizzard simply can not detect that stuff without breaking the law \o/
---
I mean... if you squint your eyes real hard he’s kinda cute? idk
---
Ya well, i think i will try to level her up a bit more. I want to get the hang of the class and get good at it. It can just be very annoying at times. But I guess I will feel the same even if I rerolled a warrior. 
---
I mean. Running around and a mage or any ranged class for that matter will be a very frustrating battle 98% of the game.
---
Elvui
---
Soccer only exists in 2019 because poor people can play it.
---
the mage/mage combo for outdoors AoE leveling was very common the mage stack dungeons wasn't.
---
Eh some people are just bad. Most healers I've seen doesn't seem to know about the 5 second rule and downranking. (this is at 60) As a warlock I've probably been overhealed more than I've actually been healed. I also usually tell the healers to not heal me, but most seem to refuse, instead they cast a 1k heal on me after I've lifetapped once.
---
1. Yes ruth procs off SnD     
---
2. yes 60% either no matter how many cp spent     
---
3. It can reset/proc either MH/OH, it doesnt make you "miss" it just speeds up the swing timer     
---
4. Imp sprint has no real PvE usage, its good right now for wpvp because so many people dungeon spammed a mage     
---

[Leveling Spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005303105-3200551100050150231)
---
1) Yes Ruthlessness procs off of Slice and Dice, it procs off of all finishers.  
---
2) Yes  
---
3) Yes  
---
4) Yes
---
I think its very dependent on your classes. A composition of casters would be fine. Throw in 2/3 melee you have 0 chance.
---
we literally get the good content from RS3 recreated for OSRS. we are already getting TBC style stuff

Not Angerforge?

Hello guy. Im will soom roll shammy. I have. never played pass lvl 20 or so. and there is few things i wanted to ask.
---
1. what race? In some guides i read that if I want to go ench i need to go taurent. of ele then orc. I dont reall know what will i enjoy more ( Im much more pvp guy) I want to try both. so what would be better race if i want go back and forth ?
---
2. For leveling ele or ench ? why one over other ?
---
3. For endgame PvP, ele or ench ? why one over other ? how viable is to mix em up?
---
4. What proffesions ? Is mining +eng still to go for pvp ? while i lvl up should i go mining + skinning ? (since this will be my first char on hord ) 
---
5. What are some negative sides of shammy?
---
6. How hard is to manage totems ? are totem addons a must ?
---
7. What are some things you wish you knew before playing shammy.
---
Thanks in advance and have a nice day!
---
Yeah, being a tank without a taunt is pretty awful, Godspeed to you sir.
---
Alot of my addons are out-dated. Even if I downloaded them as the newest edition, some of them aren't working, perhaps because of the patch that's in current use.  
---
Is there a way to fix the addons to the correct version? I've heard of the twitch-addons updater thingy, is that good?
---
Or how do I fix my addons so they all "work"?   
---
Just like at the classic announcement where even then he kept insisting he hates the idea of vanilla and doesn't want it
---
but people and npc's can attack and interrupt you while casting your mount
---
He's a Hunter, he does'nt know better.
---
That’s not quite true. As a rogue, you virtually never use your ranged weapon. As a Hunter, you use your melee weapons all the time, and actually have almost constantly your melee weapon skill rather close to max due to using it. 
---
This is mostly due to the fact you have a deadzone, and mobs often get into it one way or an other, not to mention in many indoor places you almost never can use your gun. Rogues in the other hand use their ranged weapon once each 100 mobs for a risky pull.
---
It‘s true, when you cast fear the timeline is split in two, one where it breaks from the warlocks point of view and in the other timeline the feared one can‘t break free of it.
---
I have zero people full stop friend
---
Essence of fire went up as high as 20g a piece last evening on ashbringer eu horde. I think theyre down again to like 12-13 at the moment which still is bonkers
---
I did the same as orc hunter going to NE starting location to get my lovely Owl at lvl16. It was a real journey
---
Pings not to bad (230ms in northern Ontario) I’m playing on flestriker oce, it’s the lowest pop oceanic realm and still has plenty of people on even during they’re off peak, the community is also pretty decent
---
Elwynn
---
You only need one account. But two game licenses with a sub.
---
Dude even when he announced classic he still wouldn't shut up about how vanilla is bad and he doesn't want it. Albeit in a metaphor, but still
---
Dammit Cthun you aren't here yet.
---
What makes a man turn neutral?
---
Thats because of the change they did on how pops show up, now its dynamic and changes depending on the capacity of the server.
---
Are you sure you've downloaded the classic versions? Some of the sites will download the BfA version and you have to go into the "Files" section to download the classic one
---
More vital service than classic wow? That one still needs to be discovered lol
---
Ah yes cringelords like you probably screamed about how classic or vanilla whatever was about the community, but the moment people do something "different" u get all upset :D haha jokesters
---
If this didn't work they would not send this stuff.
---
A hunter that have stellar control over their pet is a good start. Bonus points for managing aggro or even misdirection onto the tank, if you can even successfully use traps and actually CC you're probably top 1% of hunters.
---
Also, don't roll on everything if you know it's a much bigger upgrade for another class.
---
There's EU accounts and US, you don't need to be in that country, just need to make the right account
---
OwO Hewwo, step on me more mr undead sir. OwO
---
expose armor is useless in classic, may as well never learn it from rogue trainer
---
&gt; name
---
How do you reserve the name of the character on the designated server? 
---
I am planning to do the transfer this weekend, i want to keep my main name on the new transfer which i have already created a character with the same name.
---
imagine saying script kiddie unironically
---
I payed for 6 months for the first time since cata.
---
&gt;So bad at murder at PvP? I literally absorb the life of people with my utility.  
---
So they're bad at murder. They are indeed really good at living. Outsustaining other players is not really compelling gameplay for a lot of people, and it can definitely get exhausting dragging on fights every time and being punished for every misstep.
---
my prefered group is mage,rogue,priest,warrior then you can have whatever.
---
this is also the prefred group for TBC dungeons
---
I've never seen a boneless zombie before, to be fair.
---
I just tested the Twitch app. Highly recommend it. Only need to press one button and it updates the addons.
---
The early ones yes but the higher end dungeons like the ones in netherstorm and shattered halls. Yeesh. They were basically a return to form. Really long and difficult and no circle, youre hearthing or walking out.
---

You need an us account, but its not ip restricted.

Oh nice. I'll mess with the macro over keybind. Takes up way less room
---
God Alliance are always such crybabies.
---
Us alliance wouldn't treat you like the horde would treat us ;) enjoy your awesome pet, greetings from a jealous hunter :)
---
You literally said the opposite of what should be done. 
---
SND should be kept on at all times. Use only 1-2 combo points. Minimum amount you need but not overuse. 
---
SND means more sword spec procs, more frequent poison application, and consistently more dmg than eviscerating. You use eviscerate at 3-4 combo points when the mob is almost dead and you know it’ll finish off a good bit of their health.
---
Exactly, this was my experience yesterday.
---
I thought it would be somewhat more calm nowdays.. I was wrong.
---
Personal opinion, but you'd get a spot swinging nightfall as a priest if they could!
---
Currently on NA servers but just subbed an EU account also, looking for a server to play on
---
Unless you are not in a guild aiming for world first you should be fine. (1% of the pop)

My main is a mage, has been since Vanilla, and I'm already resigned to the fact that I won't raid with him. But, he will be the fountain of gold for my alts.
---
Ah, awesome! Got any link to it? or how it works? :D
---
Bags would be awesome!
---
Can confirm - level 28 and could give a flying rhinoo about power levelling. Taking my time, clearing zones, walking, walking, ... so much walking. :P
---
I have no idea but I think in vanilla you just needed the US client installed.

He looks a lot like ther german TV host Stefan Raab. My buddy and me always call it the Stefan Raab Icon...

we will keep an eye on stuff which might be OP and limit the use of it

for duel tournaments at the end of each season there will be some rules / agreements ( waiting for cooldowns / what items are allowed  / ... )

Funny enough the last time they reached group stage in Europe was 15 yrs ago...just like...
---
You need to access the rootfile in the batch folder and apply the d.addon update drive file update. Twitch task bar is a good place to start but you can download the files from curse too I think. Then simply drop them into the sub folder, upload the ui from the main menu and boom you're up to date, or should be. You can reset the ui with in game command too but I forgot it. If it's still out of date reinstall the add on or reinstall wow if it's confirmed as working with other people but not on yours.
---
Dont buy any mail gear, and go for agi stat instead of mail. If you find a leather with more agi than a mail piece its still better. But just obtain gear naturally from dungs and drops.
---
You should save up for mount, its 90g if you are honored with your faction. The gold will most likely just come naturally, its not a lot at your level really, so dont burn out farming gold :-)
---
Don't forget Frost Nova! (every 25 seconds...)
---
Lvl 31. Enh. Dps seems low in dungeons. I have windury, drop str totem and a fire totem depending on single target or aoe pull. Fire shock then auto attack. Throw in another frost or fire off CD. Am I doing it right?
---
Not worried about threat being the only person in thr dungeon. More dps to multiple targets
---
I really liked having Ripostez and I would recommend it. I think there's some base parry chance as a rogue, so with the talent you're looking at 5-10% chance every time you're attacked. 
---
Since you hit fast but miss frequently it would maybe proc at a similar rate to the extra attack. I wouldn't be surprised if even more, and riposte also hits harder at 150% weapon damage for little energy cost. 
---
That's also not including the defensive boost. 5% parry chance is nice, but disarming enemies is great.
---
I think SnD is up to you. I used it because I forwent sword spec so I used a fast dagger offhand. I open with cheap shot into 2CP SnD (which lasts most of the fight with talent) and I bet my increase in poison damage makes up for losing sword spec and getting ruthlessness late.
---
Keep in mind that SnD synergizes with sword spec. I don't know if that makes it better than ruthless, but it's worth mentioning.
---
Doctorate in sociology?

I've only downloaded from websites that only has classic websites, so I doubt that I got a BFA version. :p that's why I'm wondering, because I thought that they were a classic version, they'd obviously work. :(
---
It’s not about the fun. It’s about the message.
---
Why the fuck are you complaining about this on a video game subreddit? Get outta here
---
Usually they send mossad and give u a bullet to the head.
---
Rip bechir rabani
---
Exactly. I usually only bother putting thorns on Warriors, or the pets of Hunters.
---
Yeah why from one extreme to the other ? What about a punishment that is inbetween 500 bucks and 10 years prison?
---
oh another one of those "wheee, I want it now! wheee, NOW NOW NOW!!!"
---
Le emperor has arrived
---
Common sense.   It's a shit sport that you can play with anything vaguely round so poor people get into it.
---
I'd be happy to help any hunters with this issue, unbinding your turn keys should help and theres a few macros too. This hardly ever happens to me and I consistently land combat traps
---
This is my first post on this sub, but yeah I guess it wasn't that funny.
---
Wow lol that’s a lot of hate, just thought it was funny to engage in the Horde/Alliance war effort, I’m on a RP server. 
---
So much for the great WoW community
---
All personal taste. Imo those names are awful and not funny, but that's just me. Something more creative could work.
---
Zandalar is is almost 50/50. It is one of the most balanced servers out of them all.
---
Warrior, rouge, warlock, priest, hunter?
---
Yeah don't worry you'll fit right in
---
get yourself some restorative potions. admittedly, you need to use them preemptively but if you're against a warlock or priest you'll have a pretty good idea what they are going to do.
---
I feel like this was less of a problem during vanilla due to load times as well. You should especially look out for people with mind control cap and priests and be ready to interrupt them.
---
Tauren bias here, but war stomp is underrated. Great for pvp and pve. 
---
Enh is easier and subjectively more fun. Just keep a healing set
---
Prof no comment. I do lw/skinning
---
Negatives: mana is our biggest issue by a country mile. Expect a lot of downtime from exhausting your mana
---
Totem management is the draw of the class. If u hate the idea of micro managing totems, dont roll whammy. If that excites you then go for it. You'll love it.
---
I'm assuming he could no longer get in because of it.
---
I think it's just spellbatching? your auto attack and wingclip landing at almost the same time, the server responds with your new weapon skill level which is now 2 higher
---
I guess you get no attention from people in your life and desperately need validation?
---
Isn't the fourth one in the group a Blood Elf..?
---
He understands you're trying to help he's killing you because it's a pvp server.
---
No he shouldn’t use expose armor at all unless he’s fighting very high armor targets or more specifically dungeon bosses that will stay up for long enough to build multiple CP stacks. 
---
Slice and dice is what will increase a rogues damage the most when done right. You literally should never waist a full CP stack of slice and dice. You’re doing it wrong. You use it when you have 1-2 CP when fighting normal mobs. With improved SND you’re going to be having 12-14 second SND at 2 CP which is usually how long it takes to kill a mob. 
---
There’s so much misinformation being given out in this thread.
---
As a non-Huntard Hunter main, I’m feeling v attacked right now.  This classism is killing me.
---
Just fyi its enh shammy not ench :p
---
I find it pretty dangerous as a caster just because you only have so much mana. Spells don't cost less just because you're using them on a level 40, and when you run out you're in real trouble.
---
More pieces are warlock/mage only, than competed on.
---
I guess it was different in private servers?  
---
So then this item is pretty much useless, right?
---
Code and data are 2 very different things, code is the programs, written in a programming language, data is only the information part, what goes into a database.

Why join a pvp server to help the other side?

Does flametounge totem work with feral druids too?

wait for phase two to come around when people will start twinking out alts and you'll get a fair bit for it.

No it doesn't serve as a deterent because they are kids, or better said, people who do not think things out ahead of time.
---
Also, justifying a criminal charge with a civil charge is silly.
---
I hope blizzard does the pro move here and asks for an appropriate punishment. X years of community service, house arrest, and from computers.
---
&gt; Considering an MMO a sucess before those breakpoints is at best premature. 
---
This is not just another MMO. It is THE MMO.
---
Considering the following history :
---
\-10 years+ of "NO" to Vanilla, because it was deemed to be a failure, followed by :
---
\-"You think you do, but you don't", followed by virtually every SINGLE Blizzard suit, CM, WIP, and the VAST majority of the players :
---
\-"Classic WoW will be, at best, a niche game, that will fail to bring people back", followed by :
---
\-"Probably less than 100k players will be at Classic launch", followed by :
---
\-"Well, Classic will be a moderate success, because there are some nostalgic people out there", followed by :
---
\-"2 PvP server for EU are more than enough", or "34 servers worldwide are too much, half will be low pop", followed by :
---
\-"Sure, the launch was massive, everyone knew that Classic will be huge, but in 2 weeks, half the servers will be dead, because people will come back to Retail".
---
Here is the thing that Blizzard and Retail players STILL don't understand : Classic is not a game for retail players,  but for the WoW veterans than quit WoW in the past 10-14 years.
---
As such, Classic launched with well over 6 million players, worldwide, and the vast majority of them are NOT from Retail, but returning players.
---
Classic didn't failed at launch. It didn't failed in 2 weeks. It didn't failed in 3 weeks. And it won't fail in 3 months, or 1 year or 2 years. It started bigger than Retail, it is now bigger than Retail, and it will STAY bigger than Retail.
---
And when (not if) Classic+ AND TBC separate servers will be announced, Retail, which is already the secondary WoW, will be officially recognized as the second WoW.
---
Classic will always be above retail, in numbers and game quality as an MMORPG. Be it today, or whenever you think.
---
When idiotic predictions like "niche game", "dead on arrival", "dead in 2 weeks", are proven to be, well, idiotic, the "will see in 1 month", or "we'll see in 6 months" predictions are starting to come.
---
I am sorry, but nothing will change on September 27th. Classic will still be bigger than all other MMORPGs. Nothing will change on December 27th. Classic will still be bigger than all other MMORPGs. And than Phase 2 is coming...than Phase 3...
---
Retail WoW? FFXIV? ESO? Those so-called games were shamefully DWARFED by Classic. Expecting a different outcome for Classic not to still be the biggest MMORPG in 1 month or 3, or 6 months, is insanity.
---
No thanks I'm not interested in pleb sports
---
You can't change regions yea, it's a different WoW account. You might want to have a look at Oceanic servers as they are part of US realms, perhaps transferring would work there. Latency will be around 200ms though.
---
Ahhhh, makes sense.
---
Thank you for the response! 
---
Have a good one.
---
Don't you guys have bandages?
---
It's because it's a PvP server. Who cares who attacked who first? Should have deaded them on site and just been happy about it. Guy was pretty rude though
---
Yeah that's how I kind of approach it this way. Hybrid mentality more than just raw dps. Just making sure I'm ok the right track
---
yeah, as a mage myself I joined some guys groups who was spamming for two more mages for RFC. and not taking anyone else. waiting around for ages and we just told him "dude it's RFC, we don't need a specific comp". then he said it would go faster with three mages.
---
maybe so but we are sitting waiting around for 10 minutes anyway when we could have been in there clearing.
---
I can understand spellcleave in SM or beyond but lol.
---
That would literally be how they’d catch you lol. You wouldn’t only get banned, you’d loose the stuff too obviously. :D
---
Congratulations :)
---
But it does happen. And it has nothing to do with turn keys. It is because FD takes too long to drop combat, and in that time, if you take damage, you will not leave combat at all.
---
Currently lvl 44.
---
At the moment, for 5-man content, I just use the regular Blizz raid frames (icon for your buffs show up) and use my own blessing timer as a reminder to rebuff.
---
For 40-man raids I imagine we'd be using pally power or something similar to coordinate blessings across all Paladins in the raid.
---
Yea your in to something there. But I guess it’s not easy for gaming companies. I mean....it’s a general trend of all things to change. Maybe for more and more automation, maybe it’s simple human nature to constantly move towards “easy”. The path of least resistance as they talk about in physics class when it comes to energy flow etc. 
---
And also, I have enjoyed most of the expansions of wow. I have enjoyed the quality of life changes. Maybe without thinking much about it. And I have definitely enjoyed the extremely action packed and fluid combat that we have seen more and more of. 
---
In the other hand something has been lost along the way. And there is most certainly a higher maybe not seen, stress level in later games. Faster faster more and more attitude. 
---
But classic ignited the good feeling of an alternative life. Or more....the lifestyle I want. 
---
For some ppl it’s all about challenges. In all aspects of life. I have honestly never really enjoy pure challenge. It’s not something I strive for and I don’t feel particularly good when I overcome one. 
---
For me it’s about lifestyle. I have done sports most of my life. At a pretty intense level. And it was never about winning for me. It was basically that I wanted to live a life of sports. A life of instinct reaction and action and long breaks in between sessions where I so absolutely nothing at all of value. And it’s in these “breaks from the world” that I have found happiness and relaxation in wow. My best time playing wow has been after 2 hours of intense and gruelling ice hockey matches or practice. 
---
Ppl are different and with different needs. And atm. It’s so good that I can soak myself into classic wow :)
---
If you played on a private server that didn't have a 30s cd when equipping usable gear then you played a real shit private server lol

Welp. Atleast they’re probably worth a decent penny to a vendor.

Just check AH for essence of water/earth and have a good laugh. 20-25g/ piece and its sitting there for days....AH experts at the best.

Remind me
---
I’m only level 29, still enjoying the game.
---
This is both BiS for the two most powerful 29 Twink classes and (from my experience so far) really, really rare. The price of this obviously depends on the amount of 29 Twinks on your Server but I wouldn't sell it for less than 200g today and obviously increase that price for inflation if you wait until Phase 3 when most People will start actualyl gearing their Twinks.
---
I've managed to get it for myself but not for any other targets and its frustrating lol
---
No but a proc from sword spec off of SS will
---
Loving it so far. It feels stronger for me, but I had lots of intellect gear saved because I've healed through dungeons. You're used to drinking anyway as enhancement so downtime shouldn't be different but the damage seems better. You can switch at 32 but try and do it later so you get a few points in the cast time reduction talent (Lightning Mastery).
---
ARCANITE REAPER! HO!
---
Why? Where can I read about it? New to hunter class.
---
Oof, good question. It should since it works on pets, too, but don't quote me on that one
---
I used to be that way with Fort on my priest but now it costs 1/3 of my mana bar
---
dope af.
---
I'll try that when I get home! Thanks a ton mate.
---
Aim shot seems pretty nice. I'm having second thoughts about going BM.
---
Never really played WoW before, so the only thing I know about "Paladin imba" is "bubble". Is there something else?
---
"uses brutal armor" Hell yea brother, me using brutal armor to gain that bit of rage to execute ally when I am on verge of death... that happens way too often.  
---
I should probably keep it for max level, as a rage potion of sort..
---
Yeah that's kind of what I was thinking.
---
Bottom text.
---

Can't wait to Google "Blump" when I get home I'm sure there's tons of fun Darkshore stories out there

Thanks?
---
When people are sleeping or working? Oh dear Lord, Classic is dead, servers are low pop at 4 a.m. in the morning...
---
Who's charging 3g for a portal? The standard price is 1g that I've always seen and that's because the reagent is 20s unlike a warlock or rogue, as well as usually needing to teleport to visit you in another city to begin with.
---
&gt;Absolutely not. 
---
The other guy said on 95% of servers though. Which is just a gross exaggeration
---
a few years of prison and a few years of no internet usage. 
---
Thats what happened when ppl ddosed the church of scientology
---
Lmao ok bud. All you’re doing is calling me a liar and you have provided no logic/reasoning behind what I am saying that’s wrong, and what is actually wrong. 
---
And unless you’re level 60 you’re a lower level than me so you can keep being delusional lmao.
---
It depends on the content of course, during leveling/open world farming hunter melees quite regularly. And even in raids, hunters can make great use of melee swings during council bosses or bosses with adds. Their melee and ranged swing timers are seperate, so you can stand next to one mob, raptor strike that and shoot at a target further away with you bow. Melee weaving is an option for only one target. This can add a very substantial amount of DPS.
---
Point still stands that those hunters who are capable of executing a split melee/range damage rotation would never ninja a statless weapon.
---
Thanks for those red markings, they were very helpful in locating the content.
---
If we consider that WoW lore dictates that rogue stealth is a form of shadow magic (and how rogues got cloak of shadows and shadowstep in TBC, they do use shadow magic, along with the recent BfA cinematic showcasing rogues using stealth and how it looks to the naked eye.) it does not make sense for a Tauren to be unable to learn how to be a rogue other than that if rogues don’t have a way to silence their footsteps (they most likely do.)
---
32 I can get lightning mastery? Well I'll do it when I get a full leather int set. As of. As of now  I have a cloth/int mix

Careful what you say bro, i kinda said the same thing yesterday in a post of mine and got a barrage of hate lmao
---
I really don't get the aoe mage dungeon grind..like you all cried and begged for classic and the first chance you get to bypass major elements of it you take it..
---
Is this with priest?, is it faster than questing?
---
Mainly because absolute majority of loot is not BoE, so it is of no use to a different class other than to vendor it for gold.
---
I have them bound to my f1 f2 etc. Works well for me.
---
It doesnt. It does the opposite thats why im asking. As an enchanter you are doomed to be broke. I am one myself just to craft a trinket and i was always broke and still am at 60 for now. In my case i knew it was gonna happen and i didnt mind because im a druid and dont needed the mount as much as others.
---
I would keep skinning and grinding for that first mount.  I dont have a LW so i cant tell you the most profitable things to craft.  But i would check to see on the auction house for the items you can make to see if its profitable.
---
Playing all night shouldnt be an issue on high pop realm. If you are east coast play west coast. It’s three hours back so your 3 am is their midnight. This honestly seems like a non issue even if you are west coast. The server pop will be dying down as your getting off. So just quest grind farm at the end of your sessions not the front.
---
Just 11 more and you'll get your wizard's hat!
---
He wasn't helping a red, he was helping a blue.... Still a traitor 😉
---
Not true at all. For PvE you want a wolf anyway for Furious Howl. BT is the best PvP pet though.
---
They know what they do, no point pretending it isn't true.  But all g they're kind of proud of it i think.
---
Bene boys in the house. Represent!

Its almost like you shouldn't need something if your going to sell it or give it away.
---
Aren't these oily blackmouths? Used for faps.
---
Seems legit
---
Blizzard has no power to charge anyone with a crime, only governments. They can however sue anyone. Just like I can sue anyone.
---
God I'm glad being a tank and being able to just made my group with my rules. Here it's slow and steady not aoe grinding-3-mages-bullshit
---
AV at one point gave insane rep for city factions but i believe at some point in vanilla it changed so you could only do 1 hand in per AV, making it mad inefficient.
---
But ye there's no faction in the game that you can get to exalted with via questing in vanilla, cloth hand ins are always necessary. Some you can get bloody far into revered though, meaning like 80 handins vs the 420 stacks needed for rev-ex.
---
Pretty sure you can only see mob health with a addon.
---
But that quest can be done whilst leveling really
---
A dwarf and his TOOLS
---
I agree slice and dice is best. If you are improved 1 combo point is all you need for regular mob grinding singles.
---
I plan to fish them aswell and cook them. I've read that the drop rate is better in wailing caverns instance. It's supposed to be around 30-41%.
---
You can fish in Dreamer's Rock, the chamber where Naralex sleeps in because no mobs will attack you.

---
anyone know why any UI addon i download wont work? after i load into game i get a huge error with a wall of text about the addon and it just doesnt work..
---
Seeing as everybody should have the same claim to a BoE, the best option is for everyone to roll need, this way there is no possibility of somebody ninja looting the item.
---
I just ran this for the first time in ten years.
---
You did read that and it's very good in pvp
---
Couldn't you get any wolf, as long as you've learned the highest level Bite and Ferocious Howl from a worg in LBRS?
---
All of T2 is pretty iconic tbh
---
What movie is it referencing? I’m ootl
---
TBC prot paladin was actually pretty fast leveler. With Holy shield, blessing of sanctuary and spikes on the shield it and ret aura it was pretty fast killing 10 mobs at once.
---
Actual AOE groups for SM don't even need a tank :D 1 lock (eye of kilrogg pulls + Void for boss) 3 mages (Spell cleave and slow)  1 priest (shield) is all you need.  Dungeon groups are a different story though. It is unfortunate that it has gotten to the point where it is hard to get a group together without guildies
---
So if a kid murders another kid, “they’re just a dumb kid” or “I didn’t think ahead that I would murder that guy” they should just get off with smacked wrists and a strongly worded message? It’s still a fucking criminal offence, they know that it’s a criminal offence, they do it anyway, suffer the fucking consequences of their actions, I genuinely can’t believe people are defending this dumbass, acting as if being a really dumb kid is a literal get out of jail free card. They purposely picked a company to fight with who have a lot of money riding on this. The potential losses for blizzard will be up in the millions for this, so yeah being a “dumb kid” is enough for costing a company that much money and getting away with it. Fucking morons I swear
---
Impossible to get without losing your mind at least on my server, the spots are farmed 24/7 (and you'd need someone who helps you if you are low 30's anyway) and the price for the mats is out of proportion. I'll probably just stick with the Corpsemaker from Razorfen, much easier to get and it made a huge difference.
---
But the bajillion dollars in damage!??? R hi sisneiwibebr
---
Glad someone here understands the practical realities of the justice system.
---
It wasn't retail that started this aoe spellcleave meta - it was the private vanilla servers.
---
Hmmm I didn't know that was a thing. I looked all over for a good way to bind the stuff, but I just invented my own system. If bar space becomes even more critical I'll consider this, thanks!
---
Don't think so, at 32 I think you can start putting points in it. I'm 36 and I think I only have 2 or 3 points in it.
---
They wouldn't be doing it if it didn't work...some people actually fall for this.

---
If you're doing it right it's like 20 mobs per pull. The tactic is only efficient if the group is solid.
---
I'd personally be questing more but my server is a bit messed up on balance in the zones so it's a struggle.
---
No. Never.
---
This guy shouldn’t be teaching anybody about computers...
---
But the true question remains: Deviate fish or oily blackmouth?
---
You have a Discord update.
---
From Shadowsong?
---
This is the way to go for sure, when you're 60 if you wind up grabbing like a 44 pet or w/e it's super fucky to try grind it's levels up in the open world, but just join BiS farm runs  or dungeons runs with it safely on passive till it's high enough it can tank a couple of hits and then just keep it alive.
---
It'll still take like 5 runs, but you won't need to solo grind 400 mobs.
---
Oh maybe so, I'm not saying otherwise. Didn't say he was that ugly or anything, just that he could hardly be considered "extraordinarily attractive" according to society standards.
---
Yeah but it's better this way.  Now I can pvp against my own faction and it rewards situational awareness.

At most expansions I'd sub and cancel right away, that way I'd sub back if I was still interested in the game, I subbed to reserve name on the 11th of August and grasp didn't cancel right away, knowing I'd play for a good while
---
Does anyone else think moonglade smells like shit?
---
They have arrested a suspect, as blizzard said in their own post.  No charges yet.
---
And police arrest suspects all the time, it is normal.
---
No. Not everyone should have the same claim to a BoE. If you're in a group with someone, and it's an upgrade to them, its definitely a priority for them. 
---
Needing an item with the intentions of fucking *Greed* i.e money, trading, is literally ninja looting.
---
Like said you can level as you wish and that's fine. But some Rogues want to hit 60 before TBC comes out.
---
That's impossible to say without any information. Which addon? What's the error? What other addons do you use (if any)? What does "doesn't work" mean?

In vanilla I leveled as combat swords so I don’t know. They made a lot of changes in later expansions and I went assasination and didn’t look back. Combat was still a ton of fun though. I’d stick with that and then respec later on.
---
Yes,  on the money.  This guy knows his shit OP
---
Hit 60 last week and is almost done with the pre-bis so i think i'll start playing on my warlock alt.
---
gl 4 manning that boss
---
I (53) killed two hordes (mid 20s) in Lakeshire yesterday. They were out ganking alliance players at a much lower level. Am I the asshole for this?
---
This guy also correct OP
---
At first my image was cut off at the side and I thought she was talking to a horse, making it even funnier.
---
More of this, please!

The confirmation bias is very strong in this subreddit.

"They call it a MIIIIINNNNEEEEE"

The first time through it does feel epic though!

This was me in vanilla! I was so happy when I got it.

Is this considered glitching the boss? I thought it was just another strategy or whatever. How the fight goes normally?

I'm level 29 and enhance. Should I be using Earth Shock and Rockbiter in dungeons or does that cause too much threat?
---
God I hate that Horde-wall before SM.
---
Why not help the other faction out to assure everyone has a chance to hit 60 and we can all equally fight each other?
---
Man, I hate this "I'M ON PVP I NEED TO KILL ALL ENEMY'S ON SIGHT" shit mentality. There is such thing as honor mate, if you have none okay. But don't blame those that have.
---
Not really.
---
It's up there with "why are there so many warlocks?", the DPS isn't good, PvP is eh, and you're everyone's personal travel bitch.  It's retail thinking being applied to classic, and it's wrong.
---
How would it be useful for a Rogue? In which situation would you equip it and wait 30 seconds to use it?
---
Dumb kids don't murder other kids. Dumb kids might try to pull off a "l33t haxor" attempt because they think it's cool/funny.
---
Holy 0 to 100 batman.
---
Why is there a Blood Elf?
---
You equip it 30s before you need it, same as every other class.
---
What the fuck?
---
Its working fine for me [https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileBrightInternNomNom?tt\_medium=redt](https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileBrightInternNomNom?tt_medium=redt)
---
Significantly wors for me. Classic was essentially unplayable for 3-4 days
---
So cute!!
---
Would that really be the case in a dungeon?
---
What an odd question to ask him...
---
I think they disabled honor because they thought to many would complain about leveling beeing a nightmare with people constantly ganking for honor.
---
I'm sure it was 7 in the morning somewhere in the world. This is a global website :p
---
Repping my white bat, Ressan the Needler since I was level 13! Its screeching and flapping is worth more than spell interrupts to me.
---
No LFG, mindless quests where you run across map to bring something - complete and then run back to the same place, old graphics, bad balance, no summoning stones, grind... And still I have much more fun as a druid on classic then with my heroes on retail. I really don't know why. Bfa has much more content, but I even enjoy fishing and hunting enemy faction.
---
Peen belt fart...awesome.
---
Mostly just the QoL stuff really. Dual Talent spec, high stacks of items, not having mounts / toys taking up bag space and transmogg
---
Maybe you need to use some kind of affliction for that sort of things.
---
Isn't it weird that your entire premise for this is unfounded, just because you have a weird sense of entitlement? 
---
Why do you think the game bothers to distinguish between need and greed? Are you so pepega brained that you don't understand if it worked the way you're making shit up for it to work, that the game would just have a greed button for BoEs?
---
In somewhere in the late 20s early 30s while doing thousand needles/shimmering flats I ended up spending what must've been 4-5 hours just running back and forth from thousand needles, stonetalon, ratchet, booty bay, uc, hillsbrad and back again 100000000 times and only gained like 50% of a level the entire time
---
Ran it again a few weeks ago and can report it still feels epic almost 15 years later
---
Is it an exploit if they're literally just outside of guard range? I'm pretty sure that's all this is
---
I see you just anologized interrupting a non-essential service to murder. I'm not gonna bother wasting my time by seriously engaging with that bullshit. Google theories of criminal law and deterence, if by some chance you're not trolling.
---
What's the add-on for making notes on players that I see to remember if they were good/bad/etc? I thought it was HandyNotes... but that seems more for notes on the map...
---
Hyperbole big guy
---
Does destruction warlock have chaos bolt? If not, why is destro considered to be a top tier burst spec?
---
Yeah raiding in WoD was probably some of the most fun I've had in years, especially as a warrior who controlled the ring. And making enough gold through garrisons/world bosses to play for free, that was cool too.
---
YEESSS FUCKING YES!
---
You *really* dont want to know
---
It didn't "sneak in" you installed it without paying attention
---
Lmao I can see the appeal. I'd be laughing so hard but feel bad afterwards. Looks like something i would thoroughly enjoy while drinking and bored of grinding.
---
If the best gear is cloth as a paladin, you can be damn sure I’m not gonna pass it up because they don’t have an alternative. I’m going to take the gear I need, the stuff that’s best for me regardless of armor type.
---
This is dumb. I dont want help from the other faction. If you dont want to fight leave me be, dont cast anything on me. If you CC me you are picking a fight.
---
It’s difficult, especially at your level
---
Could try and spam SM but it’s really not going to go much faster
---
* raughs in Paradin *
---
If you help the enemy, always expect them to turn on you once they are in a safe position. Yes most people won't do it because they want to uphold honor to their name, but some people aren't digging that and attack red on sight (if their odds in winning are high, ofc). 
---
Daily business on a pvp server. Generally you shouldn't go out of your way to help the other faction, almost nobody expects to have friends on the enemy side. You could also get called a traitor if someone witnesses it, which could hurt you in the long run.
---
Horde hunter here, never gank anybody. Like ever. But boy do I get ganked silly by alliance 30 levels higher than me
---
I don't think that this is a good thing. ;)  
---
I know how angry some people get in this game, they shouldn't have a tool to harass their own faction. I've seen where that leads to in other games before WoW, and that's not a good thing. Good ol' Everquest "TRAIN INC!" yell. ;)
---
For some, the only way to feel good is to make others feel bad
---
Transmog is one of things that absolutelly ruins whole game, you can play dressup on bfa
---
It would be easier though? I mean he’s level
---
60 he could run me through it a couple
---
Times?
---
In this thread: kill on sight players telling you to kill on sight immediately because hurdur pvp server hurdur.
---
Honestly, I don't get it. I like playing pvp server, I love the thrill it gives me when I survive a gank or when I can fight others over mob tags but it doesn't mean I have to kill on sight like a hive-minded Borg.
---
One can be a decent, honorable being, especially while leveling.
---
Dead game.
---
Ok your reading comprehension is already proven poor because of your last statement. 
---
I don’t even have to keep doing this with you. There’s enough people who have already replied to your comment and disagreed with what you’re saying. I Think OP is smart enough to figure out who the idiot in this situation is. My job here is done. 
---
Peace.
---
This is why I love being the healer. Even if I group with douchebags, kick or try anything with me and they're all fucked.
---
Being polyd is annoying as fuck, I'd kill you as well. You're not there to help the enemy faction and don't get surprised if they murder you.
---
Can't tame critter.
---
I’d ran it in retail once or twice but when I did it in classic it felt really Fucking epic!
---
You get aimed shotas bm my guy
---
I sure did
---
He makes decisions as he goes because he’s a human, not a farm animal. If you think things are either black or white then I’m truly sorry.
---
Not good for who? The plebs?  Not my problem
---
As a BM hunter, warlocks and Spriests are my favourite targets in WPVP.  I would just sent my broken tooth in with bestial wrath and then watch their priceless expressions when they realise that he is immune to any CC for 18 seconds.   A lot of the times they'll start running right after lol
---
When doing the Ashenvale quest for stealthed outrunners the Ooze gave me a similar debuff. Super painful!
---
Nobody cares about your stupid limitations
---
Hey man, I have the same thing and feel the same way.  
---
It is frustrating, I have a house, a job, a girlfriend, friends, and I like playing video games. I see the judgment in some other people's eyes too. I don't understand, binge watching Netflix series for 4+ hours is socially accepted, but playing a video game for 4+ hours is nerdy and problematic?  
---
I have one friend who plays videogames, but we play different genres. He's the only one I can talk to about videogames.  
---
I try to just ignore it as much as possible, and know that as long as the rest of my life is going well, I see no reason for liking and playing videogames.
---
I've been over there, it's a whole lot of nothing. There's a lake and some trees, mostly flat terrain when you get up the mountains.
---
Can't remember for the life of me how I got up there though. All of my old screenshots died on the old family PC a decade ago.
---
No. If its not 10v1 its not fair. 
---
I had some white knight pull this on me the other day. Fuck morals in video games. 
---
RED=DEAD.
---
if you like mage, you should give destro lock a try, its pretty much just a different flavour of fire mage, less about crit managment, and more varied in its gameplay style.
---
Never.
---
Dunno why the downvotes, you’re completely right lol. I’m brand new to WoW with classic and I realized this myself while playing on my hunter char
---
I mean... it IS goldshire. Can HARDly blame you there.
---
As a rogue I'm comfortable engaging warriors several levels higher. I guess no one knows what they're doing cause warriors have been free kills so far.
---
Enchants in RFC?
---
And even then, it's an estimation.
---
You sure did but they removed your post.
---
Yeah because DDoS isn't a hack lol
---
From this I get that I wouldn't want to group with either of you.
---
Because the factions are not supposed to help each other out to hit 60. You can do it of course, but you must also accept that you're taking on the role of a traitor then. If you two are alone it'll probably be fine, but imagine 5 alliance ride by and see you, as alliance, helping that horde guy (who may even have bad history with these 5 alliance). I can guarantee that you will land on every single one's ignore list and that this information would spread quickly. 
---
Yes you can feel sympathy for the enemy because we're all human players, but the only honorful reaction of helping them without being a traitor, is not actually hurting them and leaving them be. You don't have to take my word for it, it's just my piece of advice. That's just how pvp servers have always behaved, they will in Classic too.
---
...get out...
---
Somewhere in the options you can turn it off. I am not at home so I can't tell you where exactly.
---
This has to be one of the most beautiful things I've seen. I'd give you a gold medal unless I had to pay for sub.
---
That would be a dick move even if it were SM. Not all of us want to level and do dungeons like it's Mythic+15
---
I thought it was ugly - or at least too busy. Having a background between the important parts of your UI just makes everything look cluttered.
---
If you want something like that that looks cleaner, try TukUI or ElvUI if you want to customize it more
---
I will help occasionally (usually when they are grey) but the moment they hit me with any attack I bury them.
---
One of the most important things for being efficient and making more gold may be to use a bank alt asap. 
---
I think this FAQ is helpful:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c630uj/basiscs_faq_bank_alt/
---
You don’t know the backstory. If the nasty horde is attempting to gank my precious alliance comrade while he was half health after completing a kill quest, it’s fully justified to kill that barbaric dishonorable horde.
---
Love your work man, amazing. Please keep it up.
---
Not much info to go on, but are you sure you have downloaded Classic addons and not retail addons?
---
How does your bag space let you blueball so long
---
I often hear about a guide that takes an unusual stance on hybrid shamans (ele/enh I believe) but no one ever links it. I'm hoping someone here has seen it and can post a link.
---
Slaughter those dirty horde/alliance. Keep the WAR in Warcraft.
---
Sell it
---
A lot of people cling onto the false notion that paladin is somehow a bad class, even though a lot of the bad aspects got fixed during vanilla patches. As it stands in 1.12, paladin is the best pvp healer, the most efficient pve healer, and the sole reason why alliance has a much easier time in pve, both in endgame and while leveling. Furthermore, they're better than warriors at tanking 5-man content thanks to superior AoE threat, and a good retri paladin is a force to be reckoned with in pvp.
---
The thing with paladin is that they shine in groups, not so much solo, especially due to the lack of slows and mobility. With everyone jumping on the mage bandwagon, which happens to be amazing in both group play AND solo play, it's no wonder a lot of folks like to hate on the paladin.
---
Thankfully, I've never suffered any of this anti-paladin toxicity in-game. Quite the opposite. People love me for healing and buffing them in the open world, and tanking dungeons for them while most warriors adamantly stick to DPS. So if you're thinking about rolling a pally, know that most of the toxicity is located outside the game, and know that when you're in a group, you can support and save the group in ways no other class can.
---
Just checked AllyRoute for 50-60, plenty of questing there and not much grinding.
---
Can't decide between playing shaman and Priest for healing. What shaman does better and which are its shortcomings compared to Priest?
---
Your little brother is not a bot. Stop calling him that.
---
A mage could help you with portals and food. Maybe save up the elite quests in some zones and do them with your friend. That wouldn't impact your exp from mobs too much. Other than that I wouldn't bother. At 60 you get gold quicker so he could buy you some leveling gear too.
---
pretty sure its just bugged, i know it was stupidly strong in vanilla but i legtimatly never have seen it break in classic
---
Okay I might just do it. It's a sign I guess since I cant get those 2h drops from gnomer and RFK but I keep getting awesome int stuff. I'll respect today. Should I aim for 1h and shield or just whatever has the best stats?
---
Rolled Horde on a other server with a friend yesterday. Playing an undead warrior. What professions should I pick? Engi+mining or herb+alchy?
---
My WoW experience is my lv24 rogue so I am still quite noob. I partially level with my priest friend. The pots from alchy can be a real lifesaver for me (I have alch on my rogue aswell) but I love engineering. The gadget and goggles are so cool. Alch feels like the safe option but I could buy pots on the AH right?
---
First time I went there I got ganked as I was about to step out. As a rogue I cant wait to spend my time doing this :)
---
Itemrack is configurable to do that I've been told.
---
No, Everquest is THE MMO. WoW is great but let’s be realistic.
---
Considering how meta it was to run cleave groups (both 5 and 10 man) the first few weeks this really doesn't surprise me since the meta comp was basically 3 mages 1 war and a priest for spellcleave and anywhere from 2-4 warriors + healer for melee cleave.
---
Omg please unselect that chest and select that neck right now young man!
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
Aha. And you despise poor people I guess?
---
It does not. It does have soulfire, shadowburn, and conflagration, along with a higher crit modifier.
---
can confirm @60, cat is for opening damage, bear is for high incoming damage or pursuit (with charge/ stun). and main damage comes from entangle, heals and spells in caster form.
---
As a warlock i can tell you this will always interrupt when i don't want it to.
---
Ok thanks a lot
---
An AH addon that tells you the price ATM? Twink items have already started to rise abit, so you should be able to figure out what items you need to wait on if its outrageously high
---
Feelsbadman.  I camped a 60 warrior as a 51 lock.  Killed him 6 times in a row until he called his guild to save him.  Level is not everything ;)
---
Just wait for the pvp system, then it truly becomes a true corrupted place of horror.
---
What does intelligence do for hunters? How much of a damage increase are those 10 intellect that you are of the oppinion that it is more valuable for you than for a caster for which intelligence is the primary stat?
---
If you would fight as much as warriors do in real life, no way you would be obese.
---
You can live your life as a Son of the Harpy or be known as Ser Barristan Selmy. 
---
Respect the 1v1.
---
I'm a pvper and serious about things being efficient but that doesn't stop me from being darkspear, the best race.
---
&gt;Do you know how to always show the Numeric Value if the XP?
---
Just make another icecream joke.
---
it hurts to think about levelling enchanting just to drop it later
---
You have an AoE blizzard?!
---
Rolled a warlock after playing shaman to 34 but I'm not sure how to specc. DS/Ruin or SM/Ruin. Right now I'm going the DS way. Also, should I first spec into DS/SM and then into ruin?
---
You mean [Ice Cold Milk] ?
---
&gt;when it comes to two evenly leveled players engaging in Azerothian Mortal Kombat?
---
Never happens anyway. I'm only engaged by group of players when i'm alone, players with 3+ lvl advantage or when i'm low life.
---
At least it wasnt Legion or BFA, that would be pure evil.
---
AOE runs with friends is fun. It requires different skills, so it adds variety (as long as you do more than just that). The real problem is randoms, as usual.
---
Lupos is nerfed in classic afaik. So no reason really to get him.
---
Yes and that's his opinion of vanilla, he doesn't like it.. He's perfectly entitled to not like it and you are perfectly entitled to your own opinion. Neither you nor him are wrong.
---
Didn’t the last kid that got caught DDoSing get 8 years?
---
Would love to see 10 for this one just to make an example out of him.
---
Depends on level. In general, dot up everything you can without pulling aggro. Then, spam shadowbolt or aoe. If mobs are dieing too fast, only use corruption and then shadowbolt, or just aoe.
---
Tbh I ALWAYS have this problem with white american males. Are you european or is this a universal issue? They all sound the same to me.
---
Except if you're running 42 casters you run out of mana.
---
Did this with at 42 with a 47 tank, 42 priest mage lock and shaman. Outside of him resisting every other spell we ran out of mana and cooldowns as we hit the burn phase. Second time we tried we had the tank cleave the adds instead, the shaman and healer swapped off healing so they could regen their mana and we basically saved up mana before the burn phase. Still couldn't hack it. The fight would probably go a lot smoother with warriors/rogues.
---
Dps is the same  for all pets
---
Hey guys. Level 26 tauren enh here. Right now I'm using a 1h mace + shield. It's been working well for me but would a slower more dps staff be that much better? I haven't level 2h at all.
---
How quickly is MC going to be cleared dude?
---
With 1 billion dollars I can buy a new kid.
---
I saw at least two within the last two days
---
Plenty of us with fulltime jobs took vacation to hit 60, and good luck convincing any of the current hardcore guilds to bring you along as anything other than a meta spec. Most would just rather 35 man it than bring somebody not playing optimally.
---
I‘m subbed since 2012 and until classic I played at best 20 hours during this time. Also bought every ex without rly playing it. Needless to say I‘m bad with money
---
Why did I read this with the dwarf voice in my mind...?
---
Its the ciiiirrrrcle of grief
---
I hope so :D
---
Will be interesting to see how long they wait to release phase 2. I mean every phase is going to be important, but phase 2 is probably the most game changing.
---
They just have the typical low T american nerd voice. Seems like every twitch streamer sounds like that.
---
I just don't understand, why would mages join a group that is not advertised as spellcleave, and then demand a spellcleave.. That's why everyone hates it..     
---
And also because most of them don't understand the basics how it works(especially when looking for tanks, lol). It's not blindly spamming AE..    
---
Do you want spellcleave? Make your own group and advertise it properly in LFG channel. So we know what to avoid.
---
Spirit Healer is a thing you know?
---
I also love your sister
---
Ah, it begins. Retail 2.0
---
Onyxia attunement if you count that (BRD-&gt;UBRS). And in stratholme the main quest has you do living side before undead. That's it I think?
---
My new main. Absolutely loving the class, always had a soft spot for it and warlock but the thing that kept me away was the overwhelming totem system. It is in fact an incredibly brain frying mechanic, especially in fast, tense situations like pvp. It's definitely a huge hurdle to overcome with the class, but once you take it on you start to find ways to map it all out in your mind and delegate priorities. Just expect that the first few times you have wpvp fights, you're going to be laughably inefficient with your totems, consequently your mana, and it will probably get you killed.
---
We had an Order hall before order halls where a thing!
---
Now his butthole is going to get DDoS’ed in prison.
---
Nah, he had a throwaway line about it "not being his flavor". He wasn't calling it bad or anything and he definitely owned up to his mistake.
---
Yer pots are always purchasable. I was a big fan of Blacksmithing as my warrior. It's good to keep your gear up to date and prices of regents are at an all time low, making it easier to level than previously. Plus you get sharpening stones which give you a bit of extra damage on your weapons.
---
Controversial opinion maybe but the guy was right. If you don't bother doing the tactics properly then you're going to wipe for 6 hours so I understand the frustration since it's not hard to kick your target.
---
6% alcohol
---
What if I really want to min max. Will there be that much or an improvement?

"I, a scholar, enjoy cookies and cream.. while you peasants seem to like the stale flavor of vanilla ice cream, anyway here you go."

Exact quote actually. /s

Omg its Grognac the destroyer, attorney at law

One day you will run across a red named man of equal level who will /point and /eat to you, indicating to fix yourself up.  
---
Then they will type /ready.  
---
And you will know you ran into a man that Respected the 1v1.
---
🧂
---
Yes! I plan to add shared lists and character lists right after adding the ability to reorder items
---
So it just occurred to me I can't see what spepo enemy players are casting beliw their healthbar.
---
Was this added later?  Is there an addon for it?
---
Except the OP literally stole it from another user who originally posted it.
---
Chain heal is op. Furthermore, totems are great for buffing. Also, you get 2 dps trees melee or magic focused to help spice up gameplay. Can wear mail at 40. 
---
Shortcomings by far is mana. Huge issue. 
---
But you get ghost wolf, reincarnated, and astral recall which are amazing
---
There are plenty of quest-rewards with one-handers and/or shields. Alternatively use green drops/AH.
---
I played after phase 2 / honor was introduced in Vanilla. However, I don't think Alliance were so meek back then. For some reason no one really PVP's in classic.
---
Not even close lol. You're insane if you think normal players are at that point yet. Reddit has clouded your judgement.
---
He took more collective hours from our WoW time than he'll probably have in his life. I guess that's something? I just did something else during it.
---
No they won’t be implemented until phase 2.
---
Have it your way, just know there Wille people not giving a fuck about what you write just because you were to lazy to hit a key every few sentences...
---
If that’s just inconveniencing people for a few hours, why should he go to jail?
---
As long as he's got the banana helmet he's still a joke.
---
Are you going to raid as DPS?
---
If yes then these will be BiS for a long time.
---
However there are plenty of other items with +5 swords in raids which will take you to 310 (sweet spot)
---
So if you get one of these due to your racial you will replace the gloves for additional stats. 
---
Being a Human I would sell :-)
---
I could agree with that for sure
---
Thanks for that!
---
I think the post said Demo shout was giving too much agro, and that battle shout wasn't splitting it correctly, probably giving it mostly to the main target. But yeah, Demo shout agro is based on how many mobs you hit, Battle shout agro is based on how many allies you buff.
---
This is the exact reason I run character notes addon.. run into a toxic fuck?  Make a note on him..
---
Sorry, gnome hunter? You sure you're not playing retail?
---
It's not bad, but usually a waste of time. Stuff dies too fast to get the full use of it most of the time and it only hits one target so it will only really be useful on bosses.
---
An off healer can deal more damage than you would expect, the hybrid tax doesn't really start hitting people until the 50s.
---
What's a GM gonna do about that? Not to be a dick but that's not their job. What you can do is tell your guild/friends/world chat what this guy did so people don't group up with him.
---
I think he’s suggesting that horde hunters and shamans both want mail, but on alliance only hunters use mail.
---
I like the second part of that picture where it said level 60 character, but the crabs were purple and the stick was glowing LOL
---
No just more than half of them. I play with a hunter friend and I had to coach him how to not be a huntard because it seems that class is like a lightning rod for entitled and dickish behaviour.
---
&gt; any 1.2 speed cat will have a 100% uptime on frenzy 
---
This is objectively not true.
---
Was wondering if there is an addon for making notes in game?
---
&gt;I don't even see the point before the PvP system
---
because PvP is fun, and the only reason we're playing WoW is to have fun?
---
they should have killed clicker trash like you
---
If he likes cock as much as he likes being a cock he won't have a hard time in prison.
---
If you can stick to using swords they are more or less irrelevant, but if theres a lot of human warrior/rogues in your guild having thoes might get you the good axes in the game. As a fellow human warrior i would sell them in a heartbeat.
---
You can also consider not cooking them, depending on your servers prices. They are also used for alchemy, so you might get better results that way
---
&gt; why chests should be shared but other resources not
---
Chest have a chance for a multitude of random items that any one can use, nodes have a specific resources that only the person with that profession can use.
---
Opening chests is a utility built into the class, gathering is an optional utility that can be used by anyone. When you invite a rogue it's guaranteed that they have the lock picking ability, so it's expected of them to use it. Just like when you invite a mage it's guaranteed that they can make food so it's expected of them to make it.

Before you get pedantic about it, you can argue that the rogues lockpicking might not be leveld, and I can argue that the mage didn't learn higher level conjuring. But that's irrelevant to the point that they're both abilities backed into the class that add value to inviting them, and therefor those abilities should be used to benefit the party.

---
I find that this satisfies my needs
---
I've noticed this too. Very weird and definitely different from how it used to be.
---
The people who reserved names have already had to resub
---
Yeah plenty of addons for that. I forgot if the default UI has an option for that because I installed a bunch of addons as soon as I got sick of managing individual bags, and that was long before I encountered any casting enemies.
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
You could still play while ddos attacks were in place. Only certain layers were affected. I remember that you could create a new level 1 undead character and ask someone on an unaffected layer to add you then log off and back onto your main and then you could play again.
---
Not with that attitude, you won't.
---
I’m on this
---
Was really no reason to say any of it during the announcement. Like he puts a lot of emphasis on how he loves the other flavor, which is obviously retail.
---
Why? Could have made a joke that included vanilla without having to state again how he doesn't like vanilla
---
The best part is when noobs teabaging my corpse when I have SS........
---
You know what, I actually thought I *didn't,* but I totally do.
---
I thought Classic would be a nice nostalgia trip, but I'd get frustrated and bored by how inconvenient everything is. On the contrary, I'm thoroughly enjoying all of it much more than retail. The levelling experience is a lot of fun, in contrast to rushing to max level and repeating the same content every day/week in the form of world quests, LFR, mythics etc.
---
It was added later. There are addons but they only have the combat log as a resource so it can’t account for lower ranks or spell pushback
---
The curve is just before 40 at the moment, last statistic I've seen. Many won't make it past the grind and/or give up when they run out of quests towards the late 50s. BRD farming will get popular, but people will also get sick of it after just farming SM for half a dozen levels.
---
Im a level 60 shaman who has done MC already. Priest healers tend to be focused on healing tanks. Shamans are king of aoe healing but all we really do is spam chain heal. honestly its really up to you if your sole purpose is just wanting to heal they are both needed. Shadow priest are good for 1v1s. But if you like to gamble and you like magic then shaman is for you. One roll of the dice and the alliance just disappear when you play enhancement. Elemental drops people just as good as enhancement but your blow through your mana quick. From alot of my friends that play alliance always tell me the scariest thing to come across is a shaman with mana.
---
You can also consider not cooking them, since they are also used for alchemy. Really depending on your servers prices, etc.
---
Just delete the character with the name you want right before you transfer, if you don’t delete it then you will be prompted to rename your char since the name would be “taken.”
---
I think the default behaviour in VuhDo is target on Alt+Click? Not sure. I think the spell assignment for targetting is just 'target' so you can assign it to whichever button combo you like.
---
I would consider respeccing to BM. [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/150032215050105](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/1500322150501051)1 is the standard build for solo levelling.   
---
Your mount will likely be your next priority. I would advise grinding in an area where you can skin everything you kill. This should give you steady XP gain and plenty of animal parts / Leather to vendor. Probably the most efficient way for you to make money. Before you go out to grind clear your bags, all you'll need is Food for pet, skin knife, bandages for you/pet if you have First Aid and maybe some potions for oh sh!t moments.
---
Speak for yourself
---
This sint vanilla anymore where people didnt know better and just took the safe route of no pets allowed. You can use your pet in 95% of raid encounters if you know what you're doing
---
My sub ran out... and i am not sure if I will re-sub.
---
It was fine... and perhaps when the snow starts flying i will need more gaming time to fill the days... so i might still pick away at it in hopes to hit 60 for phase 2.
---
There is spread sheet calculated that you dun want to have more +8 where you reduced your white glancing hit to 5%, anymore weapon skill won't reduce more cuz they become like 4.98% while round back up.
---
&gt; Especially a multi billion dollar company that has more lawyers than you have sexual partners.
---
Especially a multi billion dollar company that has more lawyers than Isekai heroes have harem members
---
go on...
---
Rogues do get auto dibs. Every group I've joined has just ceded locked chests to me without my asking. "if you can open it you can have it". 
---
There isn't actually anything stopping a rogue from lying about his lockpicking level and then going back for chests after the run. And this is highly class lore appropriate.
---
That's what I was thinking. But we do have a lot of human rogues and warriors. And that Ony axe is really nice. I'm also farming ironfoe but no luck.
---
Well if it works like that then how come the other fire totem doesn't get wanged immediately when its attacking one target in a group fight? You would think the other mobs would attack it but they dont
---
99% sure that's an auto-ban based on volume of reports.
---
That being said the amount of reports you must have gotten against you from lowbie Horde here is sad. These Horde are a disappointment to Thrall.
---
Keep us updated OP, I've done my fair share of ganking and corpse camping and to see a ban from it is disheartening :(
---
What an idiot.
---
Real enterprise companies are very inefficient and full of stupid broken software and are not working with any real load anyway.
---
No. It's by far warrior that has double the amount of players as the next closest class (mage).
---
Barely anyone is playing rogue now.
---
You know, it is an option to put nothing lol
---
Because agi gives crit.
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
And your kid's kids. And their kids.
---
Looks more like a ghetto image of death wing.
---
I've been able to attack people in range of guards in wide open areas without triggering them before, I don't really see this being an exploit..
---
This isn’t an exploit.  He’s outside of the range of the guard. Would you report him for killing you if he was just outside the range of the guards on the outside of everlook? No. Same shit happening here, it’s just inside the hut. 
---
If the guard was actually targeting him and was evade-glitched out because the location was unreachable for NPCs, that’s a different story. 
---
But this guy is just playing around aggro range.  That’s not an issue.
---
I just think that in a Pve scenario such a spec just doesn't work with the game mechanics in wow. Even a hard cc class like the enchanted from eq would barely work if cc's just aren't as good as "just killing everything quick with core dps classes".
---
Please, I don't want reality in my fantasy game lol.
---
What dungeons are a must for warlock? (I dont care much about having BIS pre 60 stuff, I'm wondering more about the higher lvls). I'm currently mid 30s
---
I'm asking because so far I've skipped all of them (easier to to just quest, I'm focusing on getting to 60 asap with limited free time) and feel like i might be missing out on something
---
Also, which dungeon quests give IF rep?
---
Do you spec into demonology as a warlock when you mostly draintank with succubus? If so what specs and at what level? 
---
Im nearly 30 and have no points into demo yet, the affliction perks looked too good to resist.
---
Yeah, and playing warcraft for top parses is quite competitive. Actually, it's more competitive than most forms of WoW PvP. Because if you lose arena fight, you can give it another try. But in case of heal-meters, you get a fixed amounts of attempts, as long as you don't wipe in case of unsuccessful try. 
---
Though there are some nuances: 
---
1) You usually don't compete with healers in your raid: 2 good healers usually means that none get any ranks. 
---
2) After all, if the boss doesn't die, everyone gets nothing. 
---
And as there is no goal for the whole faction, your faction fails usually don't really affect you in any meaningful way.
---
And for all you non-Swedish speakers, fitting is close to "fitta" which means "pussy" in Swedish.
---
Beautiful piece, I love the dynamic feel of everything going on!
---
The only thing bothering me is that the skeleton's arm isn't connected, but other than that it is incredible!
---
Lockpicking is a profession that has to be levelling, not a baked in class perk. It also doesn't exist as a service but to benefit the rogue. So many clueless comments.
---
I just don't get humans sometimes.
---
Question to a expereinced elemental shaman; how good is Skullflame Shield in PvP?  
---
I'm reading a lot of comments on Wowhead that the +spell dmg coeffifient in regards to gear is 100%. In my opinion this would make it a pretty good PvP shield.  
---
Thoughts? Thanks!
---
Earthfury isn’t dead. It’s a great server, actually. Right now there are a ton of people in the 30s and 40s, and more people will be transferring to avoid queues. A few guilds are in Molten Core. 
---
We hesitated to switch from Herod but we are all glad we did. All of our buddies who hesitated regretted it when the window closed, and are taking advantage of the new window to transfer.
---
Tanking in Classic is/was extremely easy. There are barely any tank-related mechanics and Active Mitigation is pretty much non-existent.
---
Four Horsement might've been the "hardest" fight to tank and that one amounts to move to the next target and hitting taunt.
---
I get for my lvl 16 Priest (second acc) in WC, around 20% of the level. around 50-60exp per mob
---
I Bomb in the first Cave everything at one (3min) (9%), then i go on the left Wing (Lord Anaconda) run to him while pull everything. 11% if the level by 5min.
---
all in all i need 10min with run out and reset to get 20% of the level. its a little bit faster than Grind/Questing but not much.
---
the main throttle is the "pull everything", i hope SW will be much faster at lvl 23.
---
hit me up should you need healing
---
CoA deals the most damage with its last tick. If mobs die too fast its usually not worth it.
---
In dungeons, I'd use it mostly on Bosses, maybe on the off target on trash pulls.
---
Because of this I only skill my warrior together with my wife who plays as a healer.
---
The recipe is a very rare drop in lbrs so it shouldn't be long now.
---
Sell it, The edgemaster gloves are basically there to make you human/orc. You are already human.
---
The answer to your last question is Gnomeregan
---
Mages can blink into the Dalaran bubble, there's just .. nothing to do there.
---
If it's bound to mobs that can't be CC'd, then yes. Otherwise you're completely wrong. Nearly all chests can be stealth run.
---
My whole guild is 30+ old people with jobs and kids, the majority of us are 60. We're the opposite of hardcore.
---
But the people who are enthusiasticly playing this week, why will they just stop because they have to resub?
---
Creating charakters from both factions on PvP realms has been possible way longer than bfa. I am 100% sure it was allready possible in WotLk
---
Try mounting the second you get outdoors
---
Thanks for the good advice and yes, I'll be raiding as fury. We have a lot of human warriors and rogues in our guild so that is of some concern.
---
That +5 sword from BWL won't be out for a while as I understand it.
---
Just give up already. I don't demand your herbs and ore, you dont get my chest loot. Greedy hypocritical fuck.
---
You need to turn render scale up, boi.
---
My experience has been the opposite, which proves there are cowards on both factions.
---
cool, i did do that before to get to 40g before i realised i needed 100! i'll go somewhere i can skin heavy/thick leather and do that till 100, i don't mind doing that :)
---
OP states they told him they wanted to pull the boss to the top of the stairs because it glitches the animations, only stands to reason that would affect the fight itself.
---
While that might be true on the server YOU play on, I was talking about the server I play on ... So I dunno why you are saying "No." to what I am saying.
---
Fair point Haha
---
Lamp shade
---
My trust in Blizzards anti-cheat/botting was over, when I got banned from SC2 for maphacking. Took a few days for them to admit the error &amp; unban.
---
You realize those are just visuals, right?
---
Try a guide, plenty of free ones out there. While its not the true "classic experience" it will reduce time running around by a huge margin if you have limited play time. I also prefer it over in game add ons as you still need to somewhat use your brain.
---
The only reason my group was able to kill it is we had our healer ding halfway through the fight.
---
transmog. I wanna play dress-up without having to wear terrible gear.
---
/#ImWithKickGuy
---
I hope you're not a warrior, cause you need the food.
---
It's just easy to use to grief people though.
---
BONK
---
I'd normally feel bad for the guy. But bruh, turn off auto run
---
That's exactly my point though. If you took vacation to level a character to 60 you're probably in the hardcore category. Once the casual players hit 60 much later they won't want to play with those hardcore players and would much rather join casual raiding guilds. The two parties have different goals. And that's fine. But it's a shame when my friend in the extremely casual camp thinks he can't roll a paladin just because they can't main tank the most hardcore raids. Posts like this and the attitude of players in-game furthers that mindset when it couldn't be farther from the truth. You really can play whatever spec you want in wow classic and have a great time. And in dungeons you can make pretty much anything work.
---
Yeah you're right. Warriors will always be the better tanks overall. Bears do have the benefit of producing insane threat though. In early progression when warriors are still gearing up, bears can already let their dps go nuts without issue. I think it just depends on the comp your guild wants to run with. Bears do fall off hard for bwl though. There just isn't any gear from MC that really improves on what they are already doing. Once they get some gear from bwl they start to catch up though and can finish out the phases. They struggle the most from bosses with fear effects.
---
And?
---
Well he is a troll :D
---
Pretty much exactly this.
---
Then when they announce TBC subs will sky-rocket like never before.
---
But the water looks so out of place. Modern water looks wrong next to the classic textures.
---
Oh great, thanks! Very good addon already then
---
:)
---
Lmao this guy. Its the superior game. Nostalgia isnt a factor when 30-40% of private server players on nostalrius were aged 15-20. Explain how people that never played the game could have nostalgic feelings please.
---
And how do you explain the sudden appearance of $1 billion on your account?
---
Not only that, but shame his guild too so people know they have shitty members
---
I’m just gonna but my epic... not trying to wait and already almost have enough
---
Yeah I love when people pull mobs to me then they vanish, now it's my problem. Good thing this rewards me for being good 🙄.
---
At 250 leatherworking you can buy a salt shaker and turn deeprock salt into refined salt for cured rugged hides. These are currently selling 35-50g on my realm.
---
So will everyone. If you don't understand why a game that hands everything to you on a silver platter without having to work for it is bad, I don't know what to say.
---
Wonderful! Thanks!
---
Im horde but if i saw an alliance in the same predicament I would have killed the shit out of you and then out of broken tooth lol
---
Person picking up rogue to play as class also knows that he’ll get lockpicking, same situation as picking up professions. 
---
“profession resources are used for specific professions”
---
But I can use those resources too, to craft something or to sell on AH for example. 
---
I don’t expect any mage to give me food for free, I cook my own food. 
---
If you want to be super fair, then sure, roll for chest, I won’t mind. The winner is free to open the chest on his own tho :)
---
It's just spell batching. Can't be my 7ms.
---
I had not considered that. Though warriors could potentially roll for mail too if it has the stats they want.
---
As a night elf hunter this makes me happy when I finally get to 60 in a few months.
---
*Viper Sting*
---
&gt; a super easy, cheesy instance   
---
&gt;super easy
---
You might even call it barely an inconvenience
---
&gt; If you haven’t tried it yet, make a shaman tank. There’s a few guides  out there and plenty of talents in the enh tree to make it viable. I’ve  tanked every dungeon up to level 31 so far and I love it. Except WC,  there’s too much nature resistance in there 
---
I tanked WC easilly on 18 lvl. The only immune to nature damage is Skum i giant lizard. Instead of ES just use Flame Shock and Searing Totem on him and keep hitting him with Rockbitter :)
---
&gt;note
---
My opinion is that a blacksmith with keys is equal to a rogue that could open the box.
---
If you were good you'd see someone runbing at you with a pack of mobs and take appropriate actions.
---
I doubt u are in full tier 1 yet, so your repairs are mediocre at best. That 1 gray staff you pick up will cover it, if you die alot in dungeons it's your own fault.
---
I get fort from a lot of priests but I honestly dont get MotW from druids much if at all hmm..
---
Ret Paladins have made up [less than 1%](https://i.redd.it/inruw89rxkn31.png) of raid dps so far and sadly for a reason. Their damage is simply not competetive. Not to mention that dps are a dime a dozen. Unless you go with friends, who are deliberately okay with handicapping their group, I doubt anyone will pick a Ret paladin over another warrior, mage, hunter or rogue.
---
The class was simply never designed correctly (and likely never will because "#nOChAngES!!1").
---
Someone get this man the NFL
---
damn son
---
You sacrifice xp gains per kill but are able to grind more efficiently.   As long as you keep it moving at a much stronger pace than when solo’ing it could be beneficial.  
---
maybe download an add-on to track your xp per hour and compare to doing it solo.
---
LoL, WoW.

Horde Warriors have Frey Island right? Are allies welcome there?

Just down vote and move on nothing to see here

For every shaman out there, and every non-shaman as well, please signal boost this bug: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/unable-to-move-groups-while-in-combat/304954
---
Not being able to change members' groups in combat is a huge nerf to the usefulness of shamans in raids. The whole point of bringing many shaman was to swap them into the priest group to mana tide on rotation.
---
right AFTER you tell him to fucking wait and let you drink after rebuff...T___T They even answered “ok” sometimes. Aaaaand still nobody waits and they just run to the next pack.
---
It's the gen z culture of wanting to fuck with people, and getting them mad to see their reaction. That paired with wanting to be infamous.
---
I'm at a complete loss here...
---
My guess is theres a lot more picture to both of these, but they’re in a NSFW subreddit.
---
Do I really have to waste space on my drive and download retail just to be able to distinguish the classic addons on the twitch program? :o
---
/e fuck wave
---
I didn't instantly join and think I need two accounts, I played on 1 account for a good while before clocking I could make a second account purely for Auction house and maybe make some gold from it.

inb4 someone this guy loves grouping with already does this lol
---
I don't know what to tell you man, spellbatching does not add a 400ms delay to everything.
---
=(
---
Seeing a one on one in the wild between two evenly matched players is met by me with either watching on the sidelines or continuing on whatever I was doing.  They have their beef to settle.  
---
Be a Paladin, not a Rogue.  Anyone can hit a man while he's down, but not everyone can say they put a man down to begin with.
---
Just like they can't fight or have a career or vote right, that would be crazy!
---
Use the search function on reddit, this gets asked every couple of days. 
---
Right now people dont have alot of money. sell it for a few hundred or save it for later.
---
I think being burned to ashes is an effective cure to undeath.
---
Just dinged 50. I'm a arms warrior (first time playing wow) and want to know what should be my best plan of attack for the next ten levels. id like to enjoy it, level quick, and also farm for my BiS if that's a possibility. Should I start hitting dungeons to gear up or continue questing?
---
what are the other 2? I thought it was the fastest.
---
Everything a Ret does can be done by a Holy. Nightfall duty usually falls to whichever tank isn't currently tanking.
---
#1 least commonly played is Tauren hunter,
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/94gzq9/_/e3pi4i9/?context=1
---
Here you go.
---
Most of the stats that have come out for various different servers show that warrior is the most played class followed by mages and sometimes hunters.
---
Yeah it's almost as if some context is missing. 🤔
---
If emulation is legal why not use emulator to ddos?
---
The print screen button is right there on your keyboard. it's easier to press than grabbing your phone ;)
---
Haha, true! Having additional DD reduces the overall fight duration, thus boosting pre-pot uptime (not sure if there is still pre-potting in actual WoW though), while additional healer steals your possibility to pour more healing into the raid.
---
eventuated?!
---
A fellow intellectual I see
---
So you all wanted a run of the ragefire chasm?
---
Sad you can't single handedly destroy settlements and grief people?
---
What the fuck are you talking about lol
---
100% agree with this. Guards are currently super buffed and make World PVP much harder around opposing teams bases as a result. I noticed they seem to spawn way more additional guards as well.
---
Yikes
---
what about realmobhp? or health. Its “realmob” something :(
---
Get a few more levels and start hitting BRD imo. You could do torch runs for fast XP but that gives no loot so eh.
---
Doesn't it just calculate the damage you've done to that particular mob and use that as its real health for any subsequent mobs of the same level and type.
---
It's possible. Ever since Classic launched, I've been eating healthier, getting my sleeping schedule right and minimizing every chance of being sick/incapacitated from playing. I need to be in top shape for my body to endure the strain of playing the game every hour of my free time. I try to speedrun my chores/work, so I get the same amount of work done in less time, which translates in better efficiency at WoW. It has truly taken over my life, I'm min-maxing my life so I can play WoW. I feel like I've completely lost my mind.
---
You got a good chuckle out of me ;)
---
Adjustments to make hybrid classes more viable in late-game wouldn't hurt. Increased range on nameplates, maybe. Adding new gear or instances, but keeping to pre-TBC lore could be nice.
---
But this is a damn shit post though, isn't it?
---
you choosed PVP server. stop complaining
---
I think that setting also shows for other mobs, but not sure.
---
I Think it is Samwise Didier one of the artists on the team.
---
You see this icon in Warcraft 3 in the world editor too.
---
Without ground clutter it is easier but still some herbs still look like decorations.
---
Not only this but using a fast 1h/shield with flametongue or wind fury is pretty competitive dps while running levelling dungeons.
---
I was coming second on dps at level 30 whilst healing RFK with a tank enhance build.  Windfury and auto attacking while healing and casting rank 1 earth shocks to interrupt.   It’s really fun.
---
I mean I didn’t roll need over someone else.  I double checked with everyone on it and all was good rolling Need.  I don’t think it’s worth getting your panties in a knot over non lvl 50 gear.  Ur gonna change all of it.  I get it helps lvl.  But most staffs I see are under 5g in the AH and they all have over 10 int/spirit.  Which isn’t as good as say the one I had which was like 20int 10stam 8 spirit.  But it’ll do.  Just don’t play with those ppl who pissed you off.
---
Watch out, 48hr awake your viewers can report for self harm if you’re twitch.

We used to call them script kiddies, and if the concept of being a disappointment to your dad were a person, it'd be them.

Uldum is still technically correct
---
It also depends on where he lives, as local laws will apply unless it turns into an extradition to the US.
---
I don't think so. I have no memory of it in wow ever and the first time I noticed in classic I was confused but I've grown to like it a lot.
---
Also, they can organise groups for the instances 55+. E.g. If they can get a group to carry you in UBRS, you get XP and potentially decent loot.
---
It certainly does. There are a ton of strong axes especially around BWL that will be quite nice to use on ally warrior with edgemasters.
---
multiply that 1.5 hours by thousands.

Wow, they might get a full month out of it 😉

---
In case anyone wants to know how to defend against this happening, if you hold down your mouse look button while running without autorun on the entire time, then when distracted you'll immediately face the correct way again as soon as you move.

If u dont want that to happen dont play on pvp servers, otherwise wheres the fun?

Unless half of them are undead/warriors/shamans.

Rolling need on bows and guns that have stats as a warrior when the hunter's there feels soooooooo good. Screw your class for needing my ravager, y'all can go and suck on it :D.
---
I still dont get it
---
Then clearly you should go join their groups.
---
That looks great. I was there just yesterday, next time I'll try to imagine it like this.
---
That's awesome where did you get the stl?
---
If you're using it to initiate, you can just replace yuour "normal" initiation ability. So if you normally initiate with charge, and you add a macro instead, just replace your charge ability with that macro and put it elsewhere.
---
I don't have any heals on my bars that isn't some form of macro, because it gives me more flexibility with less buttons.
---
As a pally, at what level should I respec from Ret to holy in order to heal 5 mans?
---
until someone like you gets banned, retard, then it's all "OMG I CANT BELIEVE THIS!!!!111"

---
No, it does not, the fact that you think it does shows you have no idea how it actually works.
---
It's been out for 4 weeks dude
---
The Legs are easily the best gear and probably good enough to last a hunter for like 8 or 10 levels
---
So why don't you contribute instead of bashing something that other people like you do *for free* ?
---
Haha! Good to see people born after vanilla WoW was live playing Classic. You're definitely the coolest here kid. Definitely.
---
I agree. In my experience though so far it's mostly been a mage or a pally ironically
---
I have 6 characters, everyone I play with has at least 3. I think 4 is a good average number.
---
I find it's better to use 1h on higher lvl mobs and 2h on equal or lower lvl mobs.
---
My beard would put you in the ground
---
Yep, there are. I can farm gold but there's no guarantee I'll get these again or that by the time that I want them they'll be available or at a reasonable price.
---
This is what I mean by torn lol.

Glad it's not just me who doesn't remember it being a thing.  I was beginning to worry my old man brain was acting up :P

This kind of thing happened everyday, thousands of times over. The only difference being that now everyone is a streamer recording their playtime. It sucks, it happens, you deal with it and move on. If you turn each of these experiences into an ordeal you are going to be spending A LOT of time being aggravated.
---
Want to get killed while selling items to vendor? That's the reason why guards always daze and run faster.
---
It's on Netflix. Cohen Brothers "movie," in that it's a series of vignettes rather than a single story. I don't usually care for their movies or Westerns, but I feel like the vignettes kept them a bit more limited than usual and you end up with more compelling short stories rather than one big crazy story that their films usually have.
---
&gt;they will need to make changes to some bullshit systems
---
They won't. Blizzard isn't too invested in Classic and they won't spend work-hours trying to come up with a fix that doesn't piss off the NoChanges-crowd (there isn't one, everything pisses them off).
---
There are no fixes or updates coming for the forseeable future.
---
Thank you... Basutei
---
For literally being my Hero. The man who made me realize I DO in fact look SEXY AS ALL HELL IN CLOTH SCREW ALL OF YOU THIS IS WHAT PEAK PALADIN LOOKS LIKE!
---
But since I'm more of a Warrior main these days? Heh... macro at ready...
---
"ARCANITE REAPER! HOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
---
For the swarm!
---
Yep the add on works great and transfers data to unit frame add-ons. Woo!
---
This may be classic wow but I agree it's being overrun by a retail attitude.
---
Which is when the shamans wolf up behind you.
---
so this isn't even a pug or ?
---
Yes, and Domino too
---
Literally no trace of it on the internet before 2016
---
yall are crazy if you think this deserves a punishment worth more than a slap on the wrist. There are real criminals out there raping, murdering, etc. Get a life nerds.
---
Lol it's a federal offense for a reason. Everyone knows it's highly illegal and the fact that he chose to do it still is no one's fault but his own.
---
it's a dps loss, that's what it is!
---
Facts are on my side.
---
Thanks, it's been in my list for a while since I'm a big Cohens fan, just never got around to actually watching it yet.
---
Most realms have their own discords. I personally feel like that would be much less efficient than just joining the ingame LFG channel though.  I don't have links for those discords.
---
Most bank characters will be level 5 because you can disenchant at that level.
---
Aoe grinding spot for a mage lvl 30-33? I saw the wyverns in thousand needles but they seem few and far apart. Any other spots?
---
58 or 60, probably 60. Unless you want to tank torch runs at lvl 52 then you go prot
---
Why play warrior, if you're going to opt in for the easy way out???
---
Fully agree. I keep everything maxed and water at low.
---
I DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO RECODE THE FUCKING WENSITE YOU MONGOLOID
---
Calling someone young isn't an insult either they're young and don't care or they're not young and you're wrong.  This one's the latter but it's probably just the obvious language barrier
---
[Ackchyually!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/035/135.png)
---
I just know how long it takes even if you are very fucking effectively. Unless you AoE farm dungeons as mage and don't play on PvP server then well, that must be great classic experience for you &gt; :D
---
who actually ever said that?  Because of course it was going to be, just a bit spread out across more players so less of an issue.  But yeah it was always going to be a problem.
---
Miss. Miss. Parry. Dodge. Miss. Parry. Miss...
---
Never played melee, so that is what I picked, everyone here was complaining that rogues would be 50% of the pop and wariors would be a challenge to level and many would quit, so I picked warrior. dont get me wrong love the class, but there are so many of them and barely any rogues, so i kinda wished I picked rogue.
---
Before Classic, people would play on Pirate Private server. So people would play the retail version (the one you can buy in retail/store) or on Pserver. 
---
At least it's my interpretation
---
Sorry for going off context but what's the addon to have different heals on LMB/RMB/MB4/MB%/etc, when clicking that group frame?
---
this sounds fantastic thank you. the weekend of grind is upon me.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
I couldn't find a trace of it mentioned before 2016 so that's when I thought it was, but had to dig around to find the actual year, so yeah it was 2013
---
Ahh well it has been close to 15 years ago and I was bad at games then and had no mods so I probably missed them all
---
You’re supposed to die to guards, corpse walk closer to the grave, resurrect, then turn the quest in quickly before dying again.
---
Seems like a combination of them being clingy and you being desirable to be around.  
---
It is hard to just approach someone in a game and be like "look, i need my space" because they will most likely be offended.  
---
If you just let it go, nothing will change.  
---
I think the best solution would be to decide whether you like being around a particular person or not and then go from there.  
---
If you genuinely want to be around them, have a talk and set some boundaries.  
---
If you don't, whatever, let them be who they are. They are essentially harassing you. I would't feel bad about putting them on your ignore list.
---
They put the "class" in "classic". 
---
I'll leave this forum now.
---
[That’s like...](https://youtu.be/pWdd6_ZxX8c)
---
For sure, I’m starting to dabble back in retail and sort of raid logging in vanilla.
---
Going to work on an alt and stuff soon though.
---
No, we just use our phone to take photos of a screen.
---
Nobody should be getting ganked for hours on end, that's idiotic. There are other places to level up of your faction loses a zone for a while.
---
I can't spare a square.
---
Someone made one yesterday, look at most upvoted post from this week, you should be able to retrieve it
---
Whens that?
---
Are the little dragon whelps actually also in the game as pets too? I got one of those in classic back in the day and it was my pride and joy.
---
Dominos is way better imo, paired with luna raid frames but i guess the default blizz frames are ok
---
Counter argument; get good.
---
Lmao, okay.
---
If a metro leaves the station every 15 minutes, is never delayed and you show up at a random time without checking the schedule, how long will you have to wait?
---
One of my alts is but my gf is a healer.
---
شكرا
---
This isn't it, I think, but thank you! This was a good read!
---
A lot more swords than axes. Still bis for orc fury warriors.
---
The work around to this is to jump as you are exiting.
---
Of course we do.   An idea.   Based on the previous weeks since launch, the previous years of build up and previous pserver scene that give an indication on the life cycle of a vanilla wow server.
---
Nobody is claiming we have a perfect picture, but we do have an IDEA .
---
i have 20ms ... constant, your delay is to high ... it's your ISP ...
---
Customer service being too friendly and printing a document from a usb drive....
---
be warned, if you try elvui its a loooot of work to set up... very worth it though if you like that kind of thing, it's super customisable
---
Ask yourself this - was that deadzone intended by blizz or was it an oversight.
---
Uhhh no? It's definitely when *you* block, dodge, or parry...
---
Alright, thanks!
---
It was several hours. Worth it.
---
MICE: Money, Ideology, Compromise or Ego
---
With as brazen as he was about the DDoS (posting on twitter about it, letting people know what realms he would hit and why), I'm leaning towards Ego.
---
To comment on number 2. Below 40 there isn't much difference but after 40 Elemental is definitely more efficient for leveling.
---
Haha! That honestly wasn't the case tho, he was pretty good at healing
---
Shut up alliance scum.
---
How is it hard to justify? Playing hunter is so much more fun than playing mage (obviously this differs from person to person...)
---
That's not particularly difficult to do, that guy's always mad.
---
I decided I didn't like that guy when I watched his twitch stream ONCE and he ate an entire honeybun while talking with his mouth full.
---
Disgusting.
---
Alright thanks!
---
gotta know your classic before commenting
---
Quests still give rep even if they’re grey or green
---
Wait.... Lower attack speed is faster????
---
Who decided that
---
I think your poor reading comprehension is acting up again.
---
Would pyroclasm or aftermath be more useful for a burst destro build in pvp? I would like some utility for the build but I can't decide between the two.
---
The extra point will probably go into imp. searing pain to make it 5/5 if I choose pyroclasm.
---
i enjoy sheeping everyone. whenever i come across a horse, i turn them into a sheep no maher what. my character does not kill other players. ever. except for hunter pets. i kill all hunter pets while the hunter is a sheep. but other than that, i am a pacifist.
---
7.5 mins average
---
I'm so Doan with these jokes.. and Doan think I wont Doan vote you!
---
And we thank you for that ; )
---
Ayayayaaa
---
Not letting people in a group play their assigned roles is kind of a dick move. It's cool I guess since  you haven't played before, but I would be more mindful of that. Especially for tanks in these low level dungeons, it's basically the only utility they have and you snatching that away from them in the middle of a run is not as cool as it might seem at first.
---
Loved the clean interface. Could you share your addons list?
---
there is no bug, and it can't take 5-6 seconds. The reason you have this cd is called Global cooldown. When you shoot with your wand, you'll get the global cooldown starting. To not get another global cd just make sure you cancel the wand before another shoot.
---
Enemies can ruin your cities. Like raiding orgrimmar or stormwind. And it's fun. But it's not ok to camp Tarren Mill 7/24 because allies comes to hillsbrad foothils with higher level quests.
---
Yeah you seem stable aswell.
---
Guy ddoses a game and cause of it people cant play for 90 minutes
---
Your reaction: ”glad hes caught hope his life is ruined and he gets raped in prison”
---
Kid was a retard for not thinking through what his actions would cause. But what’s your excuse? You think rape is ok?
---
26 Priest
---
What is the quickest way to level up? Dungeons (including quests in dungeons) or Quests or a mix of both?
---
Also from a coin perspective, which is more profitable?
---
I find that with some quests, you are getting good do, however there can be a lot of back and forth, I feel that the time running around to areas and back to hand in quests is a lot of downtime. Whereas with the dungeons it’s relatively non stop.
---
Hi Cybersecurity guy here.
---
No one will ever hire that guy.
---
What he did was impressive, it was just incredibly annoying.
---
You're suppose to use Rock biter with a 2 hander over windfury, it scales much better. Unless of course you're doing dungeons just use windfury.
---
You use windfury with a fast 1 hander and shield.
---
With as brazen as he was about the DDoS (posting on twitter about it, letting people know what realms he would hit and when), I'm leaning towards Ego; he did it because he thought he could get away with it.
---
I never understood the shard bag. I only keep 3-5 shards on me at a time and use the other slots for loot.
---
If you leave your keys in your car, should I be allowed to take it?    
---
If a developer misses a bug, should players be allowed to exploit it?
---
add-on is called blue shamans
---
It's so damn hot... [Ice Cold Milk] was a poor choice.
---
oh man that is one epic old copypasta
---
Except that's clearly Moria.
---
Ever thought he was only using 400ms as an example purely because you have initiated this thread with an unsubstantiated claim that everything had a 400ms delay?
---
If you’re going to raid as Resto, you’ll need Mana Tide. Even if Rogues or Warriors don’t need mana, a RL will switch you to the Mage group for you to drop Mana Tide.
---
If they hold out the releases for the rest of the content for too long people will leave. The whole 6 month phase thing, from what I understood of it at the time, is kinda self defeating.
---
I'm the asshole who just wants my shit sold and doesn't give one shit how the market is doing, sorry. :(
---
You're a female night elf, neither are you honey
---
Yeah, why?
---
Tender wolf meat is top tier cooking mat right now
---
If that's the case then please be so kind be so kind and tell me how everything you do can have 400 ms delay without you always having a 400 ms delay.
---
#OMG WHY?! 
---
I’m never gonna unsee that
---
I find that most people have better food at my level. If I bump into a low level war I'll make him some bread, the poor sod.
---
You can toggle between curse of recklessness and agony to control that.
---
My (Alliance) guild did a RFC run a couple of days ago, we were all around level 23 to 28, so the run itself was relatively easy. Getting there was a bit of a challenge though. 
---
We put a mageweave bag up as a prize to the first person to actually get into the instance.
---
*Fellowship theme intensifies*
---
Wands are definitely jamming when stopping to cast, but not as dramatic as you’re reporting. I’d screencap it with moving laterally to stopcast so that it’s clear when the wand should stop and when the gcd should be open. It may be a bug although I would be surprised given that it would be more widely reported.
---
What kind of punishment is expected for this?
---
2 extra white hits every 100 hits rips shit up?
---
Is Manual Crowd Pummeler really the best feral druid weapon ? Since I plan to off tank or dps with my guild in raids, it feels kinda boring having to never change weapons in all of Classic lol
---
That is not what the "fallacy fallacy" means. 
---
https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy
---
It has nothing to do with using a fallacy that does not apply. But I'm glad to see you just started your very first logic and debate class. Let me know if you need any more help with your homework.
---
Fake news. PR statement to cover up their incompetence and lack of security.
---
I had this problem and closing out my torrent client fixed it.
---
Here's a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in) to the drain tanking build. It's been pretty fun for me so far.
---
Loving the class so far. I'm only level 22, but I've enjoyed playing Enhancement and wrecking with my 2h Axe. My only gripe so far has to be the Water Totem quest.
---
While I enjoy the quests for the totems, the Call of Water quest has you running all over the world, gathering water from various sources, and then running BACK the quest giver. Bitch, if you KNEW I had to get water from the other places, you could have just condensed that into ONE quest and had me come back to you ONE time.
---
Also, the quest text for the Ashenvale portion is misleading and outright incorrect. So warning to aspiring shaman out there trying to get through Ashenvale at low-20s: The quest explicitly tells you to go west along the mountains and follow that directly to the lake. But if you do that, you'll run into an impassable wall near an Alliance outpost and its archers WILL pick you off in a few seconds. Instead, go north until the road splits and take the left path (west) until you're about to hit Astranaar, then go south/southwest until you get to the lake.
---
Sssssh not everyone got it. Keep a secret between us.
---
You're welcome.
---
Honestly though, my food/water always seem to be crap. :\\
---
I play on a PvP server and I've yet to see one of those blood baths. Not even in killsbrad
---
Damnit he knows!
---
You don't need that much time to get the good blues now. Maybe if you want that felstriker, otherwise in a week or two of dungeon runs you'll get everything. Raid gear is another story but there isn't much you can do about it after doing your weekly run.
---
it's 2%...
---
casters
---
You did two mistakes here:
---
1) You can dismiss you pet at the end of chnelling taming of another one. This way your current pet can tank new pet
---
2) Switch to aspect of monkey while taming
---
But good job with trap and well, gratz :)
---
I love how the guy tries running sideways and still falls in.
---
You do know there's other zones in that level range, right? Two hours is a lot of time to waste on that. As a horde, when Hillsbrad would get like that with alliance, I'd just leave for another zone.
---
It's the swingspeed - as in one attack in 1s, one attack in 2s ... Same as for every weapon
---
Is that a monk hat?
---
I haven't had it work once so far and I'm almost 50.
---
how do you know that?
---
Level 42 Horde, planning to reach 43 in STV before heading into Uldaman, then some combo of Feralas, Tanaris, and Hinterlands, with ZF thrown in. Only concern is the order. I see there's a lot of ZF quests that require visiting all of those zones, so is there a rough order in which to do them, or will I find myself needing to visit them all anyway
---
Dude....thats too far, i get the frustration but it is just a game.
---
Man so much this. Dungeon loot is just that, dungeon loot. Just go do it again and enjoy the game. People in this thread building salt mines over mid game blue items that get replaced or because their bis is also bis for another class and somehow feel they deserve it more..lol
---
A slow 2 hander scales better with rockbiter :D
---
communist
---
That's what you get.
---
I hate you
---
Can confirm this. Level 53 here. I would say more often than not I join BRD is as DPS. Even though I am trying to join as a healer to start getting my pre-bis. There is just too many healers that start actually healing 50+. I am going 30/0/21 until my guild makes me change for raids.
---
difference is night and day between my dead server with zero 60s and the server with 50+ 60s in the second week of classic
---
I dinged 36 last night on my Shaman! 
---
I agree I want to roll at least one alt to 60 and have 1-2 twinks when the BGs come out. 
---
The same people who said classic will die out in 3-6 months are the same people who said 'Sure Wow is popular but no way they get over 3, 6, 9... 10 million players! It's impossible!'
---
You must be a single child.
---
After getting into a serious guild this was never the case. I almost always had a group of people ready to do what we needed, including alt runs and generally helping each other. That was my community. This was true over nearly 9 years of WoW.
---
Yeah well I'll kick that Warlock in the nuts.
---
*Hello Deathcoil my old friend, I've come to talk to you again*
---
Honestly Ironfoe having less than half the proc rate of private servers  (2.7% vs almost 6%)  makes it a lot less interesting for me.
---
Im a New player and I didnt know I wanted this so bad before I played it
---
I don't even remember this instance and i played wow from 2004 to 2012
---
bubble and stamina are good for squishies, shaman are better with tanky people
---
So, it's more easy to run away than expect both sides act and play like adults? Got it.
---
Try ESDF and have ctrl/alt/shift on extra mouse buttons.
---
No, it's pointless because this is a "the community majority decides" issue and you think there's some kind of objective correct choice here. You are going against the majority here, who think you are a ninja looter if you need for the auction house, it's not more complicated than that.
---
Not all opinions are worth the same amount, yours is worth nothing.
---
Warning.   The music is horrible....  I mean really bad.
---
Pricey for a benwa ball lamp
---
Tfury here, wpvp happens more often than not. STV and Shimmering Flats are stable for maybe an hour, then the powder keg goes off and it's a warzone for the next few hours lol
---
Not that bad... I had my armour reduced by 445 for 20minutes (I think) by some mob in 1000 needles.... as a lvl25 warrior at the time trying to kill level 30mobs this was bad for me.
---
There this really useful addon that tells you what sex/race and class a player is in chat. Dont invite any Warriors if your a tank "WOW HOW AMAZING" now I get the same outcome but dont come across as a dick.
---
A note to all DPS Warriors, there are alot of you out there I know, but this is literally what a majority of tanks do by default especially on horde as we will have no mail/plate wearing paladins to compete with in rolls once the scarlet monastery switch over for hunters and shamans is done. So you will already find it hard for a group... and then when raiding your gonna be playing 2nd fiddle against tanks again for there armour. Honestly try Rogue  the world will be a much easier place and utility is through the roof.
---
On Nethergarde Keep in STV there are more people than mobs. 
---
After 2 jours of trying to do the tier 1 Hemingway animal quests I said screw it and just started grinding mobs elsewhere.
---
Football*
---
Im afraid this is not true in Vanilla, I get maybe 5-10% of the original rep if it's grey. Green, haven't tested yet but read its half
---
You would think I never played with keybinds too. But I use a naga mouse that has 1-12 on the side so my binds look like their are no binds
---
Ended up doing a couple weeks for pserver dwarf priest didn't like it. 
---
Rolled a Troll Priest, love it.
---
Can confirm. I had both alliance and horde on Frostwhisper in WOTLK.
---
The opposite, I don't even play fortnite and when I did I hated on all the aspects that are wrong with it because there are many. I'm a building fanboy, building is the best mechanic for  competitive game
---
The only reason you would do it as a "professional" is extortion.
---
As a fellow hunter, I'd totally leave you be if I saw you flagged while trying to tame a new (rare) pet. Been there, so I know how it feels. Glad you got him!
---
Print Screen, dumbo.
---
Where is the 55 fury warrior with a shield equipped that can only keep aggro on 2 of the mobs every pull?
---
An interesting read.
---
The take-away here is: don't be a helicopter parent. Whether that translates into foisting a phone on your kid so you can have them at calls-reach, or demanding to chaperone them on all of their trips so you can make sure they don't get up to any trouble.
---
fair enough, i have been tinkering for like 10 days straight to get to a point where i'm happy haha
---
I don't play a rogue, but don't you have spells that scale off the attack damage of your weapon?
---
I have no idea how to keybind them but id like to know that too.
---
I know nothing about priest in pvp and world levelling.
---
However, using shaman and going down the resto tree has given me a fun levelling experience. Rock biter, lightning shield, searing totem and flame shock plus melee attacks are all I need and I can kill mobs quite easily. Leaving me with 600-800 mana for heals if needed. Otherwise, I move to the next mob and have 350-450 mana left.
---
Quick dungeon queues
---
No buffs to give to people but waterbreathing..
---
I've been ganked by levels higher than me while fishing and had time to still switch weapons, buff up, heal, and turn the fight on them and kill them.
---
The totems are very strong.
---
This is just my input, very fun class to play this far. (Level 27)
---
Seems like a lot do agree with him and condone using bugs. Who would have thought?
---
Shadow Priest is arguably the strongest 1v1 class in the game. A good one can melt literally anybody’s face.
---
What lvl is that my man
---
May ≠ Will
---
Holy crap. This is probably the 200 IQ play
---
You don't need any of those the mobs and the player pulling them are both visible to you and you should have no issue avoiding them if you're paying attention
---
That's the entire reason they changed it in retail because it was annoying to die when a spell was still cast. But it's also part of vanilla that makes it vanilla. Mages sheeping each other, rogues gouging, kidney shotting etc. At the same time.
---
Weird I was good at 15 with an active wow sub
---
The other two are bats in ZG which isn't out yet.
---
Consider making yourself a mouseover rank 1 earthshock macro. You can interrupt a cast without changing targets, which is super nice in dungeons.
---
Same here, worst thing is you've to transmog to hide helmet and cape.
---
Heirlooms are just.. the worst idea as it made leveling even easier than before. (Childs play)
---
Spent a good amount of time yesterday testing my new dagger spec on Fairbanks alliance. Your generosity won't go unnoticed. That warrior though, let's hope he's not as squishy as the homes and dwarves were
---
Mobs that do t see you drinking and eating 20 yards away in an open field is bad too. All mobs with eyes should Afro at visual range and chase you till they would tire if they were real creatures, so several minutes possibly. Continents should take weeks to walk across and flightpaths should take hours.
---
Ha ! i got the exact same drop last night :D
---
Where did you get 6 million from. I haven't found a source.
---
I recently started playing Classic again after many years, and the feeling of teaming up to beat the instances is so good, it's what makes the game for me.
---
Not really meant for a warrior, I would sell it.  Buy yourself a green shield.
---
&gt;As such, Classic launched with well over 6 million players, worldwide, and the vast majority of them are NOT from Retail, but returning players.
---
Source please.
---
CAME HERE TO FIND IF SOMEONE ELSE WROTE THIS KEKW
---
That explains it! Its probably the file permissions so your settings dont get saved. You might have done something to the files or folders as an admin account.
---
Look up how to fix such issues, I havent used Windows as my main OS since before vanilla wow was released, so I cant tell you by heart from the top of my head.
---
Yea I hear what you’re saying. You’d need to record it and submit it as a bug.
---
It's fine but shoulders with just regular stats will be better, and start popping up in the 20's (whereas the first shoulders you can equip are generally just armour)
---
My only gripe with Shammys is our resto needed on the Blackstone ring without telling anyone he was even there for it and getting like 5 shammy items for resto.
---
Stop with this Classic + nonsense, go to their subreddit.
---
If you played alliance you probably never saw it.
---
The eels are for Greater Stoneshield Potion or Flask of the Titans generally. Early raiders would want them without fishing for it themselves
---
How do people capture videos after something unpredictable happens? Have not used capture programs in a long time.
---
Can't really "get good" when the ability should in fairness be interrupted. It's just spell batching/latency (either or).
---
Exactly this...keep seeing posts like this but most people are still leveling.
---
Let’s see how many stay to grind BiS or stay when they run out of content in a phase.
---
Remeber years ago when every fucker was doing a school project on wow and they all failed, are we in for a round two of that
---
I REALLY miss my water shield and earthliving weapon. Hopefully I'll see them soon.
---
This is why I play on a PvE server. I don't play the game to kill other players.
---
good thing no one cares about reddit. lol
---
if you're using ELVUI you may need to copy the ELVUI_Settings folder in too
---
Well I think it will always be on the market, but obviously at a higher cost. Though that is just classic wow inflation, it does happen. Farming gold before phase 2 can be quite tough for a warrior, and if there's something you desperately need gold for, it could be worth considering selling it, and then buying it back around phase 2 when you can farm DME with a healer. Idk but if you aren't in a rush for money keeping on to it seems like the ideal play.
---
Found the zoomercleaver retail retard
---
Yours is probably way prettier and does things that I wouldn't even think of, though. I just don't enjoy putting too much work into my UI, either I can import it from somewhere or use it out of the box. I do have a few redundancies that I should get rid of, but could not be bothered so far.
---
Snatching away mobs with my fireblast. Poor locks
---
To paraphrase the indian from "natural born killers" movie.
---
&gt;What did you expect bitch, I'm a snake.
---
WoW didn’t exist, so I guess your parents never took the deal..
---
I used to play PvE but rolled PvP this time. I've found there's a lot more to it than just getting ganked unfairly.

Earlier I was in the Hillsbrad yeti cave with a few other horde and a few other ally, everyone was peacefully sharing spawns until a new guy runs in and sparked a fire. It quickly turned into a big brawl, others ran to the cave to assist and it ended up being hilarious fun. Horde ended up with winning and ally were scared to come back in because they started it and got beat. I never got those dynamics on PvE.
---
I didn't wanna say otherwise. Still makes it easier to replace someone.
---
No easier to post on reddit app
---
that's gonna be a yikes from me boss
---
Back in the day MC was an 8 hour run. Shouldn't be that long now
---
Only 6%? From the *dwarves?* I'm disappointed!
---
It's not relevant you never spam rank 1 you use it for the slow so it's followed by moving away or chasing 99# of the time.
---
Whoever play gnome deserves it
---
There are 6 spawn locations, each with an exact spawnplace. The respawn time is between 12 and 20 mins(randomly). That's about as much as I dare say if you know what I mean :)
---
These are so amazing!
---
God I hope not, my entire mark is based on following through! xD
---
Once again, none of this is correct. I don’t understand why you keep typing this misinformation with such confidence.
---
If it burns when he pees, I guess it's Thunderclap
---
The down time of having to go in melee range and back out can’t be worth it to drop ranged auto attack dps. Especially when most dmg comes from white attacks. 
---
Sure it fun in a RP kind of way, but in any serious dungeon: don’t.
---
Will do! Hadn’t thought of that.
---
Just play well like you are. I have naturally made fights with a bunch on my server. Its nice to get whispers and invites often from other players that you know.
---
Bro those are some nice ass pulled numbers, even if you look historically there are plenty of pvp servers that are more alliance
---
You're neglecting that these people are legit running everywhere, just imagine the calories you would burn if you never walked...
---
Maybe it's not Russian, but on the other hand, because they can't be extradited, illegal activity online tends to be Russian.
---
It didn't used to be that way. Used to be that someone would check the content's of the chest and call for a roll on any valuables inside it. People seem to have a different argument towards it in Classic, and I've given up arguing my case. Just going to accept that this is how it's done now, even if it's stupid since people don't even know what they are even rolling on.
---
That's a LOT of minor healing potion.
---
If everyone chose horde, PVP servers would be pointless.
---
How can you tell retail players? I got told to back to retail by a toxic priest and I havent played wow in 5 years...
---
No, I had to just replace the totem and it worked again. It was random af. Sometimes it would just straight up stop getting people out of sleep.
---
Im only a level 2 druid, i dont think i can handle this
---
Are you trolling or actually that dumb ? 
---
It’s less money to have one sub for both 
---
Also those who wouldn’t have paid an extra sub aren’t playing anyways
---
go goon someone  in booty bay and send me the footage.
---
Reread what you just typed and bask in the irony.
---
I play on Firemaw aswell, does t recognize any of what you are satsing here. Sure, I meet my share of toxic assholes, but thats expected. Ive had tons of small talk conversations in /s while traveling by Mount or even flightpath.
---
My Friends list gets New additions almost every day from randoms I quest with etc
---
Also, the rogue part hit me hard. We're not all like that. Yes, I might have joined Lbrs undergeared, but mainly because of the time I have to play this game nowadays.
---
Seems to me, you should go back to the perfect world of private servers.
---
What mod you you use for chat?
---
Legion was actually good though
---
i'd buy an account just to play on your server and spam you
---
We are loot sponges, almost as bad as hunters or druids.
---
Honestly that sounds more like a typo. He probably wanted to make it the same, but accidentally undercut himself.
---
I want one for each instance!!
---
Yeah and I never said they were charged by Blizzard.
---
Guaranteed location?  Auction House.  Probably faster to grind the gold elsewhere and buy them, tbh.
---
For instance, today on my level 12 warlock I was clearing mobs around a chest outside a cave. A rogue came sprinting out of the cave with a half dozen mobs several levels higher than me on its tail. I health stoned, feared, abandoned my pet to die,and ran my ass off. Still got killed. 
---
I was positioned where I could see into the cave up to the first bend, and far enough away from the respawning mobs that I was not aggroing them.
---
yeah this is where im at as well, everytime i go to silithus to farm earth, theres always 5-10 hordes there ready to jump me as soon as i show up. There was one early morning where i had the place to myself for one hour and managed to aoe farm a lot, and only got 1 earth. Farming gold and buy off the AH seems like the best option
---
I met a priest at the same level as me yesterday. We stood in front of eachother and both went /ready, then I charged him and we had a fair duel. That was great! I lost of course because his PW:S absorbed everything and I got no rage, naturally. But it was fair and refreshing.
---
Much more fun than being gangbanged by 3+ hordes or getting attacked by some dickass when you're already low on health fighting a mob. That's how it is in 99% of all other cases.
---
I thought pulling that boss to top of stairs is just, like, what you’re supposed to do. 🤷‍♂️
---
Never done it any other way...
---
I'm the same.  35 hunter, then realized I'm melee at heart so I have a 29 rogue now.  That, and a 20 warrior i play exclusively with a friend who's got a priest.  Gotta level a warrior with a healer while I have the chance.
---
With small realm capacities yeah.
---
A lot of classes don’t really use their tier sets though
---
I love it when im playing next to a bunch of neutrals that are hounding me like ‘just try once and we will end you’. And when i end up having to use an aoe cc ability when i pulled too many quesys mobs and i accidentally slow/fear/whatever one of them, all 5 charge me like OH ITS ON NOW BITCH
---
That guide is utter crap.  He gets so many basic things fundamentally wrong, I'm not sure how you could think any of it could be accurate.
---
Really, the rogue doesn't regen health between fights?  But, gouge is useful because health regens during it?
---
Hinterlands, Badlands, STV
---
Do you really think someone who wouldn’t pay a sub for it would invest 100+ hours to get far in classic 
---
It got them hooked that it’s the same sub that might be 
---
I’m just saying a separate sub would just make people say “hurrdurr money hungry activision uhhhhh”
---
Is it a bug or not? If it is fix it. If it’s not, don’t.
---
Its a meme because the Russian government used a lot of bots to spam US social media with pro-Trump fake news and propaganda in 2016.
---
Bug abuse? Where
---
Yes, it will make the guards attack you. You will lose rep if you kill the guards.
---
It is better to do the MC on the boat after it gets going and you're deep out at sea.
---
I have a lvl 29 warrior and lvl 20 shaman, still loving the game.  Was healing WC last night, and we died lots, but it was still a very enjoyable experience, especially once we completed it.  For me classic is kinda like re-learning the game, and unlearning pretty much all of the 11 years prior knowledge.  I've got my eye on testing out a rogue as well and maybe a warlock.  Pretty much no interest in the other classes, for now...
---
Not on your 3rd to 11th alt. Then you just want to get to 60.
---
Are you the Drhots from Scilla?
---
Hyperbole is an incredibly strong word for using 60 in place of 55, haha.
---
And every source I've seen agrees with those numbers, which also agree with what blizzard used to publish when they published sub info.
---
If you have any data to suggest anything else you're more than welcome to share, but if everyone's experience and all available information both past and present point to this, then it's a bit silly to assume the opposite, no?
---
Actually it's not again TOS (I believe), you have whole world, not just one questline. But the fun in this is to take small raid of level 30's to blast out the crappy lvl 50 rogue who is camping TM :) Or call a high level friend to corpse camp him as revenge.    
---
But if you want to level without major interruptions, I suggest you at avoid these zones. Hilsbrad was always alliance dominated.
---
Yup.  This was the meta on private servers.  CC was basically just for dealing with casters that couldn't be easily LoS pulled, or mobs that did annoying abilities like stuns or disarms.  Most dungeons you could just pull everything, and as long as the DPS was focusing on the kill order the run went smooth.
---
Most of my groups I wouldn't even bother tanking skull.  Skull was just the first kill target and I would let the DPS have at it while I got aggro on everything else so by the time skull was dead, it didn't matter who was focused on which mob because I had threat.
---
Private server players definitely did better with aggro management, and vastly superior when it came to slowing mobs that run at low health.  Classic really does have a bit of a Retail mentality, but it's usually not the worst thing ever as some make it out to be.  Even in chaotic groups I tend to end with 70% or higher in Damage Taken for the run, and that's about the only metric I care about.
---
Same. I had been in groups with 2 warriors: one with sword and board, the other with ravager.
---
It was great with the one with the shield, very easy to heal, and we could do big pulls.
---
With the 2H tank, anytime we pull more than 3 mobs, I'd have to shield him because the mobs were just taking chunks of his health fast. I was often oom just keeping him and the dps up.
---
K I'm bored now bye
---
Four, the lag sucked. Wasn't Kronos or whatever hosted in the Czech Republic? That means all US players had significant lag. My lag from Chicago was like 130ms.
---
This is smart
---
I liked it, but after a few months it felt just like pointless chores. Still I enjoyed getting mats and other freebies and I found it more fun to manage than just doing grind-y dailies.
---
Lmao 35% of a Hunter's damage does not come from melee weaving
---
You only need 22 devilsaur leather for both pieces, they should be around 6g each on most realms right now.  You can farm the other hides easy enough.  You’re looking at coming up with like 150g to buy them, or a minimum of 5-6 hours with zero competition to farm them out if you’re lucky.
---
The visual style of this is giving me strong vibes of early Final Fantasy games.
---
I'd always be open to in group discussion, but if that doesn't happen then I'm greeding things I won't use :p
---
Icy veins class leveling guides are pretty good with telling what spells you can skip for the time being; wow heads class leveling guides are pretty decent too. Sometimes even better then the former at listing what spells to bypass while leveling.
---
Yeah, my guild has a guild ignore for Ninjalooters and similar. If one guy gets a Ninja in their group, the entire guild will ignore said Ninja.
---
The harsher sentence isn't because of the media, it is because of common sense. If you ruin one persons life, then obviously that has to carry a lower sentence than stealing or inconveniencing millions of peoples lives or society in general.
---
If you actually can't see why what you said is inflammatory, then you aren't as smart as you clearly believe you are.

I'm the skeleton.

How is that clip any different from the other ones? I don't see anything buggy.

Congratulations on Broken Tooth, and holy shizz biscuits you were lucky those alliance 1. didn't notice you or 2. Were very nice.
---
I only use tailoring to craft green/blue items I can DE for mats. That way I can sell the green weapons I find for coin
---
That's what DK are for and at any rate, first month of classic is not the time to make changes to coddle players, when this is a big thing disliked in retail.
---
Similarly, they recently broke Infernal to not attack others by default and not have an immolation Aura so players feel safer. I'm not a blizzard hater but it's sad how quickly they are applying the retail philosophy.
---
Can I replace water with Ice-Cold Milk? Does it work?
---
They should have left the group themselves if they were really sorry
---
I lost so much leveling time trying to compete for quest mobs that I just gave up and started grinding the last couple levels.  
---
I kind of hate it tbh, but it’s better than running through a cave with 8 other people doing loops hoping to tag a kobold as it spawns before everyone else.
---
People are really fixated on leveling at the moment.  Once everyone settles in a bit i think dynamic in the lower zones will change some.
---
I'm with you there. Both Reddit images and video. For a while, I couldn't watch ant Reddit videos on my phone's app. They just wouldn't load.
---
The leveling process has always been easy, it’s easy even now. It just takes a long time. Once you added 20+ levels, that takes a long time and can be discourage many from playing anything but their main.
---
The nerfing of exp requirements per level on top of how much bonus exp heirlooms give is where they went wrong. Well, that and how crazy strong heirlooms used to be.
---
ahead ( only place you can go without the key) you have the low-lvl area with prison and ring of law + some bosses nobody care about behind the ring of law.
---
if you keep going the only way that's unlocked for you / without jumping shennanigan you'll be on your way to the shadowforge key mobs / dark coffer / fineous / incendius then realize you just looped back to the entrance... assuming you can open that one locked door ( which you can, with the key you just got).
---
opening the locked door / locked bridge lead you to the mid-level area ; general, golem lord, bar... and beyond the mid level area you have the (drumroll) high level area where the emperor reside.
---
the not so obvious part is knowing you can lava swim to the high level part skipping most of the instance.... but otherwise, you kind of have to do weird stuff to get lost there.
---
Very nice screenshot quality
---
good idea, thx :)
---
If you ever want to roll some fresh toons together on Old Blanchy - Horde, let me know. I don't have a lot of time to play either with 3 little kids, maybe a 1 night a week thing on those toons and keep them together would be fun.
---
One tip is: Dont buy all of the tailoring recipes while leveling. You only need certain ones to level it up efficiently, then also grab ones that allow you to craft huge upgrades for you. Dont purchase the rest right now.
---
Once you get fully into wool, just vendor your linen.
---
Also you can sell bags at lower level hubs.
---
The only reason I picked up tailoring is for the robes. I'll be switching to alchemy as soon as I make them. Mooncloth CD will sell pretty well too.
---
So you don't have data. Then stop saying bullshit.
---
&gt;Plus it's impossible to find a group for...
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
Make sure you've selected the correct account. You can switch in the battle net launcher I believe its directly to the right of the play or launch button. For example I have one named wow1 which I dont use and one with an unique name that I actually have game time on.
---
Get what you mean, but since they bothered inviting me out of the blue they didn't care what tree I was speced and gear and stuff. They just expected me to mash my threat skills which I did and still wasn't enough apparently.
---
Dude the whole reddit comment thing is a broken concept, you cant even discuss an arguement because if you are not on the same view as 50%+ of the people then you will go negative karma. Doesn't matter how calm or patiently you are trying to share your opinion or how smart you are reasoning...And then people will immediately bias based on the numbers, because "most people" :D
---
I'm sorry if people actually believe that someone thinks that using a game provided setting should result ban.
---
funny that i did no digging and still was right about the asmon fanboy it's not a throwaway I simply not use reddit at all besides this sub but thanks mr Omad1712
---
And somehow it feels all the players are somewhere between 30-40. Crazy how we have to fight for mobs :D
---
You're greatly overstating how much dps melee weaving does, and I want to say less than 10% of raiding hunters do it in classic (as it is absolutely not needed at the moment given the easiness of MC/Ony).
---
I'm gonna downvote the shit out of you because being a vegan isn't particularly admirable and being a dad is.
---
Oh i know that feeling i tried some mana based class like the priest and it's really hard in dungeons when the tank is not waiting for you sitting having a good drink, so you actually throw your cup and fulled of anxiety that someone will die, because you have only half of your mana, you try your best to avoid that. 
---
But of course the Tank dies and you debut with: "OOM, Sorry" taking all the fault on you, because that's what healers do!
---
There’s nothing more serious than a Rhino about to charge your ass down!
---
I didn't even get a chance to respond before being ignored, I think that's what annoyed lol.
---
ok thx, I run alot of dungeons which nets me quite a lot of cloth (I often ask people in my group to give me their cloth in exchange for bags), I recon this might be the best way of making some gold
---
i would report them for harassment, that kind of behavior should be atleast warned by a gm. No one should just get away with beeing a dick like that. The time he lost and effort he put in the clear the dungeon only for that shitty person to have an extra chance for loot himself.
---
Saying "ding" used to mean something.  The first time I heard "ding" used regularly was in Everquest back in 2000. The level-up sound was a ding sound and, in that game, leveling up thru the higher levels would take endless hours.  One could spend days of playing before leveling up.
---
Exdee  hi bby
---
What dont you understand about #nochanges
---
nice.  Probably get nerfed
---
So my friends who introduced me to WOW took us through here to teach us how to play and we were like, "Ragefire Chasm?!?! What's that?" And they were all deadpan serious "It's a Chasm......full of fire....that rages." So when my kid turns six I'm getting him an account and can't wait for the moment I get to say the same thing.
---
You will need a LOT when raiding, maybe not in MC most guilds will steam roll it, but later in aq and naxx where the real wipefests begin, you're gona need a lot. Creating hs for people, using ss during good attempts, summoning back people who had to repair etc etc
---
&gt;There was no "convenience" added in TBC.
---
&gt;iterally the only thing from TBC that's "convenient" was that the useless "meeting" stones included in classic, actually summon people.
---
Tats one
---
&gt; And flying mounts, which were even more of a pain to get than regular and epic mounts
---
They are pretty easy to get and a requirement to do certain TBC content.
---
&gt; and could only use them in outland.
---
Which is the main continent in TBC.
---
&gt;And mage tables, which, aren't any different than what mages already did except it became one spell.
---
Its another conenince that makes the game faster.
---
And then you also have portals to everywherein Shattrath so everyone can get around easy just like a mage.
---
&gt;beyond that TBC was exactly the same as vanilla, except with proper balance that made classes actually playable like paladins, which were the hot shit in TBC because they were phenomenal, like they should have been from the start.
---
It really isn't the same, and if you don't believe me go try a high qual TBC private server.
---
TL:DR
---
Pserver zealot can't keep up with retail pace.
---
https://blizzcon.com/en-gb/event-info
---
I think you're vastly overestimating the people who even know about these servers let alone have the ability to play on them. It isn't a high bar for a lot of people with some PC knowledge but I can guarantee you there are thousands and thousands of WoW players that don't even know these exist.
---
When 2 people love each other very much, they tend to get together and get on rods. Nothing weird about that at all. Totally normal in WoW.
---
I actually love to just run from A to B and charge every mob I encounter. Just yesterday I had a Zealot Blade drop because of this. 
---
Makes it better for 'outleveling' the guide. But yeah, there's a lot of quests, you just have to know where to go.
---
Well, pick another quest hub. I doubt EVERY questhub in a particular leveling range is being raided, and if by some unlucky circumstances thats the case. 
---
Dungeons!  Or grinding! Or make some friends to help ya know...pvp? On a pvp server? Log on to an alt, go for a walk, do some dishes, re-roll to pve. 
---
There really are alot of great choices to avoid such things as camp/town raids.
---
Or I guess you could just whine in /1 about it being ganked.
---
Slower is going to help you do more damage on cleaves and whirlwinds, everything else is weapon agnostic. Bloodthirst and execute are AP based and heroic strike is just. +dmg to next attack.
---
now sell it, buy some greens and do the dance!
---
Turn around, I want to see your house.
---
And all of this while using **Frostbolt** only for the rest of your life..
---
aaaaa you can bind that to scrolling mouse wheel? :D and here i am mashing my keyboard like an idiot.
---
Why not fam
---
Not BB, but In silithius, it was well known that hunters could gank from the middle of the camp but guards could not reached the spot.
---
I remember people doing grey kill in bb near the bank and jumping/fleeing through the water not being killed by guards. But it requires lvl 60 and guards were hitting you hard
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
I've found this solution after using google and i checked it. I have 2 accounts apparently. wow 1 (eu) and wow 1 (tw) and i have only played wow 1 (eu). When i select this option its still the same thing
---
How many tanks are there around brd level? If it’s a matter of DPS vs heals that’s nbd, but I was having trouble finding a tank for ZF yesterday

Saying if I don't understand then that's my problem without ever attempting to explain is a copout for people who can't explain their point.

I'm glad you think I think I'm smart

Been playing sham the last couple days and im at lvl 23. Had a bit of a rough time getting up to this point with not being able to use shocks on cooldown and taking time to upkeep lightning shield and weapon boosts between mobs and dropping totems when moving locations. My main issue is bot being able to efficiently kill multiple mobs at once without either dying  or running completely oom. I started a warlock on the side as a second toon and bank alt and i noticed that my started experience so far is markedly more enjoyable than it was when starting a shaman. Am i doing something wrong with shaman? I looked at guides online and youtube and ive been following those with regard to how ive been approaching combat but it still seems very rough. I heard leveling warrior was rough but fuck at least all you need to worry about is hp.
---
That’s not awkward, it’s called being polite. Be glad your parents raised you to have manors. It’s not a bad thing.
---
Plus you got the stream as profe, They are omega fucked
---
Wow feels like I just saw this
---
rogues do okey you can do a lot of extra quests by just blind sap stun stealth and dying afterwards. while warriors well once half an hour we can kill a really hard mob that is 5 levels below  us.
---
what ends up happening with warriors later is the dungeon grind and mob grind is real.
---
Taking care of TOS rules are strange. Camping a questgiver for more than 3 5 hours might taken care with a GM.
---
I know some situations that GM took care of stupid things. Like freezing a single horde player on a PVP server that tries to kill a mob. https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2s59tg/a_gm_froze_a_horde_character_for_trying_to_stop/
---
No that does work, but only when i fear.
---
what server are you on?
---
on thalnos cloth are barely above vendor price... if it get any lower you'd lose money via the auction house cut.
---
But I feel guilty for ripping off lowbies. It’s like selling candies to kids at the park at a higher price than the grocery store.
---
Tbhi feel the priests pain. Fortitude mana is actually stupid and if he's confident he's going to keep you up without it does it really matter.
---
No lecture here, just sharing to you why I try to take about 40 with me for each raid.
---
1 for your own health stone  
---
2-3 for the main tanks health stones  
---
1 for the healer's soul stone  
---
2 of my healers like a health stone, too (though rarely use it)  
---
1-5 shards, the obvious one, some of your raid slackers will want summoning;
---
That's 10-12 at the start of the raid.
---
When inside the instance obviously each mob can only provide one max.  Shadowburn eats one.  I'll cast Shadowburn if the mob is going to die more quickly than 3 seconds (shadowbolt cast + delivery).  If you wanna talk min-max, I think I read that once a mob has 2 shadow debuffs on him, its more damage/mana efficient to cast Shadowburn on cooldown.  Though to be fair I don't do that.
---
Then you reach a boss, and 2 warriors &amp; your priest ask for a health stone... And your soul stone just expired so need to re-SS the priest...
---
I would honestly get anxious if I turned up to a raid with 3-5 shards on me lol... Less so for 5 man group, but still like... 20? Also you don't get a lot of individual loot from MC so its no issues having 40 slots filled with shards, but you need more room for trash in the 5 mans.
---
I think to be an enchanter and earn money on it you should enjoy talking and interact with the customers contacting you. At least my brother made 250+ gold the last 3 days just by enchanting fees, and he is not standing there all the time but maybe an hour here and there but most important is that he is in a capital city around raid times (early evening) and its especially good on reset days (wednesdays/yesterday).
---
Keep in mind he got crusader and got 35g per fee for it but he have had alot of other good fees for other enchants as well. (1-15g fee).
---
He says his secret is to not mention a fee amount but rather say something alike "fee is appreciated". 
---
Except for the crusader, that one is 35g determined by the enchanting mafia of the server :p
---
Jesus I remember Goon Squad on Mal'ganis back in the day. They charged people money to be in the guild(s). Most of them were terrible and annoying to run with. God help your server if this is the goon squad I remember.
---
I rolled on a low pop server and have been taking my time and not had these issues. Just gotta find a decent guild with people around your level and make minimal effort to add the decent non guild folk and prioritise them for runs.
---
This is true
---
I feared a dinosaur in ungoro  out of viewing distance one time. ‘¯\_(ツ)_/¯’ just moved on from that. I was chasing it down too lol. He may still be feared to this day for all I know.

Because he’s wrong.

Sure if you’re just starting the rest of the playerbase won’t be in the lower zones, but how in the hell is that blizzards fault?

Go holybkeep him healed then theres almost 0 downtime
---
Additional dungeons and raids could have gear that appeals to meme specs or that is just more specialized on the stats, and could be at any or all tier levels.
---
For instance, hybrid teir sets... what are they?  It wasn't till Nax that they really buckled down with all of the itemization points spent wisely.  Maybe make lower teir gear that comes it class sets but doesn't waste points on undesired stats, such as strength for holy pallies or agility for balance druids.
---
nice chebs

You can try throwing a discord link at the start of every dungeon, actually talking to people creates stronger bonds.

I don’t know why this makes me so happy.

Give him a hefty fine, some community service, and move on. It was a crime and he should be punished but there are worse things out there. I imagine anyone calling for the death penalty (lol) must be out of touch with reality, and must've had such an easy life that the two hours WoW was down was the biggest inconvenience they've ever experienced.

Anyone that has to resort to that comment, as if it’s meaningful, is not worth the time to be interacted with.

1. No flying mounts

2. no LFG
---
They are no where near 6g each on my server yet. More around 17-20g each. So not worth it on my server yet atleast
---
Not range, just pathing
---
I never really whined at all. But all your suggestions are just meaningless.
---
Walking to different quest hub at lvl 20 takes 30min at best. .
---
Get whom to help? Bug high level friends, ask them to travel across continent to come and kill 1 mentally challenged dude? Makes no sense 
---
I dont like alts. I have been playing wow for 15 years. (With quits, some expansion skips etc). I only leveled 2 chars. 
---
Do dishes. You are a real comedian.

I refused to play private servers. I had a couple classes to 20, but I couldn't justify sinking time into it without a guarantee that the servers wouldn't be taken down.

You're wrong there, buddy. I've joined groups as an arms warrior going to 2hand tank and had shamans tell me they'll tank it instead. They held aggro well enough and seemed to take about equal damage as I would have.
---
Yes I was struggling for a replacement!
---
And now indecision doesn' tmatter because we can keep playing the game! If you're game play is playing 9 classes to lvl 40...that's great! That's part of the reason why vanilla is so good and so casual friendly, because the game is fun immediately, not only once you hit max.
---
I play on Firemaw man lmao
---
Both.
---
I played alliance back in the day and can confirm. I also play an elemental shaman now and can confirm. The alliance die when they enter Crit City.
---
*bonk*
---
Put a bounty on him on the server forums and pay them via booty bay auction house.
---
Sounds like you pissed someone off unknowingly.
---
Sounds better to me, thanks!
---
A 60 can pull all of deadmines, for example and kill the entire dungeon at once. At lvl 30, there aren't dungeons where that can happen, but he could do probably 1/3 of it or something.
---
Lmao wot
---
Its not.
---
Aside having high armor, the proc barely scales at all and won't be of any actual help.
---
You're not doing much wrong. Make excellent use of the 5 second rule by frontloading your spells and then letting it regen. Shaman has little AoE so yes you're going to be killing mobs one by one. With Shaman you don't need to increase your kill time as much as you need to decrease your downtime. Chain kill mobs with as little downtime as possible.    
---
Comparing Shaman to Warlock won't result in happiness because Warlock is the second best leveler in the game if AoE grinding doesn't count, third if it does because then Mages take the crown. Shaman is very much an average leveler class with nothing special to it.
---
How can a spec be good for pve but bad for pvp? For instance, so many people say combat is the best rogue spec for pve but it's the worst for pvp. Why is that? If you can kill NPCs quickly then shouldn't you be able to kill other players quickly as well?
---
🦀🦀🦀 wc level? 🦀🦀🦀
---
Probably HealBot. I know it has that feature
---
Then it becomes a game of "how quick can you cast your instants".
---
foking Racists
---
I swear these private server clowns have no idea.
---
I’m a warlock in my raid and I outdpsed my warlock competition by over 150 dps, the idiots weren’t even using curse of agony for damage. Lol idiot private server noobs.
---
Loser
---
Honestly, if you feel obligated to say things like gn, gz, or hi, then why the fuck are you in a guild to begin with?
---
Nope. Just stay far away. Or die. Btw, how did he pull aggro on you? Mobs need to give you an effect to get you in combat mode. most beasts/humanoids only attacks or uses single target spells.
---
It is social interaction, some is up for a chit talk but the most cool thing as an enchanter is to meet, talk and make smaller relationships with returning customers. 
---
And there is alot returning because ppl get item upgrades once in a while and needs a new enchant, happened to me often and i love it.
---
Enchants should never be a piece of paper on AH, that is just 1 of the hundred small things people dont notice or think about but actually make ppl talk together.
---
And ofc, some ppl want to talk more or have more to tell than others so you will also sometimes meet ppl, open a window as you say and leave.
---
People are different but this is one of the small things i (we) love about classic.
---
/r/woooosh/
---
I got it last week and even when there weren't any players around, my hearth was pounding like crazy. Spent 10hours afk looking for it.
---
It's not really grinding him to 60, once he hits the 50's, they're going to be more equal and have to do full teams in a dungeon.
---
"retail pace" is wasting hours of people's time to do what could've been done if you just took it easy for a bit. Retail players would rather wipe 10 times trying to pull 3 camps at the same time than do them one by one. It's retarded.
---
Shaman have no magic dispel or decurse which is needed in pretty much every raid. We do have awesome poison and disease cleansing totems but sometimes not having the first two is miserable
---
I bought my mount the other day you know ,going Stormwind than running,than I trained and everything I kept running. Long story short I was walking halfway Feralas to unlock the flying and all of a sudden it hit me! I had a mount
---
You have to bribe the local officials with exotic fabrics apparently.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
A guild with 100 members will have less then 10 who actually communicate often, so it's not going to be crowded.
---
All the mages on my realm must be awful then. xD
---
Mages
---
at lower levels literally just put up corruption and siphon life and then wand
---
its more DPS vs casting casting shadowbolt
---
for boss mobs that have more health you can put more dots up. only really shadow bolt on nightfall procs
---
Just talk to your group about it PRIOR TO STARTING CATH. If the healer needs it, I would pass to them. It won't get replaced until BRD and the Chest of the Seven.
---
Thaught it was a [repost](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d39mrb/poor_guy_twice_in_a_row/).
---
Turns out, 2 out of 2 rogues are just jerks.
---
I'm also a healer, and I've had problems both ways. Some tanks want to try and pull everything and AoE when we don't have enough cleave to make that work, others are sitting there not pulling when I'm full mana and our only other mana class is a warlock. I've had plenty of runs where I'm just like "PULL! What are we waiting for?". Even if there's like a mage or something who needs mana, if I've got mana and the tank has HP just go and we can 4-man clear trash while the mage gets mana back. It's not hard stuff.
---
If wow classic+ happens in 2022, My wish will be that in 2034 We get Wow Classic Classic. Relive the Nostalgia of the time when you relived the nostalgia!
---
It's kind of so-so, since an upgrade is an upgrade. There's also a mage dagger from SM Library, which I had a similar experience with. I did accidentally roll for it and win before reading the other stats, but would have given it to the Warlock in the party.
---
Do as your consciousness tells you.
---
Looks dope my dude!
---
Here's the STL for anyone looking for it

---
Back in Vanilla, we had a rogue that did this to our Druid flag runner in WSG, it was aimed so good that the druid did a complete 180 and didn't even realize it until he was in the wrong base, it was the funniest thing i had ever seen.
---
Essentially your abilities are based off your main hand's damage (regardless of speed), and the offhand is more for applying poisons.
---
I always kill rogues. Everybody else I leave alone.
---
Nah just being a dad is nothing admirable.  Being a good dad definately is though
---
Should I do DW fury or 2H fury as horde? I like the 2H weapons more tbh lol but still. I plan on mixing raids and PvP (world PvP, casual bg’s)
---
I always thought they decreased the XP gain in later expacs. Good to know.
---
Ouch.  That seems, ridiculously overpriced.  Maybe plan ahead for a grind day when you could get on at some crazy time like 3am and try to minimize competition?
---
Wow: Reforged
---
Combat sword is more about sustained DPS, whereas something like ambush/backstab is super bursty.
---
You should get all of those. In my experience the shatter build (no blizzard) with nova into flamestrike+cone of cold and arcane explosion spam is more effective once your group knows how to play with it. Also you should not get higher ranks of frost nova, level 1 is enough.
---
Most weapons in Area 51 deal fire damage. APES has a lot of fire resist gear by now
---
hi mom
---
Lmao. What a good friend he/she is.
---
You said a minimum, that coupled with a net 10% difference on average (meaning there are some that are even below that) is hyperbole
---
Judging by the droprate, they should be hornless lol. Great job as always, I am looking forward for more of your art. :)
---
Na, this shit tier "hackers" are using loic/hoic.
---
What a dick satchel
---
yeah don't worry about fast 1h if you have a great 2h weapon for your level. all the weapon imbues (flametongue, rockbiter, etc) are roughly equivalent for damage.
---
Until you get a coprsemaker or other higher level weapon, you should be using staves and rockbiter to level with.
---
They will have higher end top damage and good dps. While not needing a talent point to use.
---
My completely biased opinion is rogue
---
I'm currently level 39, should I respec to Shadowform at 40, respec at a later level or stay in Disc/Shadow? I'm mainly questing with some dungeons (healing) on the side.
---
Will I still be able to heal the harder dungeons if I go deep into Shadow?
---
Could have just rolled NE, but that's just me.
---
Whitemane.  I only looked through 2 pages of silk stacks but the average I saw was 55-58 silver buyout.
---
Thorns doubles paladin dps
---
Is that spiritual wolf for everybody? I cant find mine
---
Ah yes, the opinion of someone who doesn’t play classic.  
---
Nobody gives a fuck about streamers and they don’t appeal to this significant majority of the player base.  
---
Streamers were hyped for the reasons you described, but they are not the reason most people are playing.
---
Warrior if you are tanking
---
You'd also most likely be working off of a VM and spoofing as much info as you can, as often as you can.
---
It’s actually something different. They are out of range of the guards in that spot. These guards won’t aggro if someone is being attacked near them but not in their aggro range.
---
However, there’s guards roaming outside that WILL aggro onto the instigator if someone is being attacked near them. You didn’t go out far enough in your clip to activate any of these guards.
---
I have actually been the defender, being attacked by a mage. I ran out far enough to activate a roaming guard, who promptly went inside and shit on the mage.
---
You could heal everything as elemental at 60 if you understand some basic tenets of healing. Resto just makes it easier
---
Aside from burst vs sustained damage, PVP is much more than just dealing damage, utilty is very important. Without improved stealth talents you will auto lose vs every other rogue.
---
And same with allies. We both do because someone way back started it so we retaliate the same way... War...craft..
---
Personally I believe in punishment/rehabilitation of these people but not by putting them in prison with violent offenders.  He was an idiot for doing something that petty that is well known to be harshly punished.
---
First thing I noticed to be honest. One of the best shows.
---
I wish my parents raised me to have manors. I'm stuck buying a regular house.
---
So i am a lvl 21 mage now, my problem is profession, i am 165 skinner and a 100 leatherworker. I just started to see the leatherworking recipes beyond, and just ran shadowfang keep where i skinned everything. I am not making any money at this because the market is flooded with hide and leather, and no one needs low level leather gear because quest gear is just as good. Should i quit this work and find a new tradeskill. I picked skinning because all of those bodies! And leatherworking has at least got me armor kits, but other than that a mage can't use anything else. Is it dumb to keep going down this path?
---
Hope you prized open his dead elven mouth and took a massive cow pat in it.
---
Frost Shock is great dps
---
If you are always going to level with him, go holy. I'm thinking about the same thing about leveling a holy priest. Grinding with instances only. There's always a healer spot. (I was main progress healer for 3 expansion packs in retail with holy paladin, I love healing)
---
Dont tell me what to do. I can have an opinion like the rest of us.
---
Also tbc and classic are pretty much the same, except for outloand content and some qol changes and balances.
---
All im suggesting is to add these small qol changes which wont change the game drastically.
---
But ppl like you have such a huge hard on for no changes. Have an open mind loser 😀
---
warlock pets suck
---
Latency, the word you're looking for is latency which means how fast the game responds to your inputs.  Lag is the game itself slowing down ie bending over to loot and taking 15 seconds, rubberbanding or other players/mobs suddenly teleporting around on your screen, missing entire seconds of gameplay that suddently speed up to real time, etc.
---
That one server in particular did have several DDoS attacks that generated a lot of lag, so you are correct there.
---
You keep jumping back and forth from "grinding isn't experiencing the game" and "grinding IS the game" which are two opposite stances. You cannot call me dense for not understanding when you contradict yourself from one paragraph to the next.
---
Fortnite is absolutely one of those types of games. You practice certain tricks and edits and then when you pull them off you feel satisfied and happy. You cannot end the discussion on something on your own, that's not really how this works. Also it's not a discussion it's a debate apparently as you said which I don't know why you're splitting hairs on that but if you are you should be consistent.
---
Acting like a person who just jumps into Fortnite and has 2 hours of play will have the same experience as someone who has put in 200 hours of play is wrong. You're also discussing kids on a macro scale, so I don't understand why you're only taking the top level of play into consideration when there are hundreds of thousands of kids who are at the level below pro player and played a lot to reach that level. I bet when original WoW came out the top players were mostly adults as well so I feel you're moving the goalposts here from your original point. 
---
Look at the top earners for Fortnite. The average age comes out to be about 17-19. I really feel like you're on the outside looking in on both the Fortnite and Smash communities because as someone who is a part of them you're not understanding their demographic very well. The top players of both Fortnite and Smash are 18 or under. MKLeo is 18, Bugha is 18. Taking the top players is a bad look because most are actually young in both games. You can say they are not but looking at top streamers isn't really the best way to look at actual top players of the game. I'm assuming that's where the disconnect lies between your understanding of these communities and reality. You can shout that they are not kids but I do believe being under 18 constitutes a kid and shouting will not change that.
---
Breeding was not a good mechanic and untouched by 99% of people who played Pokemon in any generation so I really don't think it's the best indicator of a bad change to reduce grind, unlike the national pokedex example I gave. The national pokedex being gone is losing out on a grind unless you think those pokemon just pop into your game.
---
Smash abbreviated is SSBU or SSBM depending on the game fyi. I really don't think Youtube gives you access to the demographics of who watches videos does it? If so please point me in the direction of where to find that info so I can check Zero, Leffen, and other's tutorial videos to see what age demographics are a part of it before I respond to that point. The Japanese teen you mentioned is not being freaked out on for his age or commitment to the game in that sense. There are a lot of young players in the Ultimate scene that really isn't a rare thing at all. Go to a single tournament and you would see that. People are hyping up his commitment to the game because he doesn't know english very well, moved halfway around the world to play a game professionally while still a kid. He also has a great personality and is fun to root for. To say it's because of his age and commitment is a very small portion of why people enjoy watching him. His youth is not the anomaly, just a small part of it. 
---
Kids are doing the grinds. You are just uninformed on that part. You have no proof that they are not. I believe that when a Fortnite Youtuber says their demographics are mainly children, release a video of tips and tricks in Fortnite, get hundreds of thousands of views, then those views just might be from those kids that Youtuber says watches their videos. Unless you can come up with some actual evidence that would state otherwise, I really don't think you have a leg to stand on.
---
Fortnite is a grind, kids are capable of doing the grind and do so. You can keep on with your "these kids today" routine but the type of grind kids enjoy has changed. That does not mean that they do not enjoy grinds, just that the one you are referring to is less popular. Kids would rather grind for the chance at a million dollars and fame and fortune instead of a virtual mount.
---
Yeah I'm going to make the transition before 40. Getting gear and such now
---
eh Tb dte ,rleaH  huv.lalwoewllsee twlwln e!
---
Dem lives getting in the way of leveling. How dare they.
---
I'm thinking there has to be a lot of people that are playing classic or wow in general for the first time because of streamers. There is a bit more skill required now and lots of people are just failing even basics because they have no clue what they are doing and don't really care to learn cuz it's "just a game".
---
Hopefully in a month or so all the baddies will have gotten bored and fucked off. :D
---
It's just AOE.
---
It’s like blocking a highway then asking for a “toll” 
---
I think this kid missed the story of the “toll troll”
---
You either gotta undercut the shit out of whoever is selling the leather you want to sell or just vendor it. You won’t make anything off crafting professions like LW until lvl 300. Weird you chose lw as a mage why not tailor?
---
42 Troll Priest, just now got enough for my mount (90 gold with Honored status for the faction).  Can I go to the riding trainer in Org or do I have to go all the way back to the troll starting zone to get the raptor mount?
---
Go Shockadin. You'll be able to heal, and still put out dps if you're not leveling with your pal.
---
"Russian bots" more like American and Israeli bots.
---
Imagine if OSRS could have this level of love....
---
I think it's more fun to kill for a reason than to kill randoms, of course it has to be random at some point. Killing now means possible retaliation and most people won't come to your aid when there's no reward.
---
So I shouls reroll as a more "useful" class if i want to raid and do my guild favors? No, that doesn't sound very fair to me
---
There is more content coming. And plenty to do at endgame.
---
Thanks, please don't do it to me :P
---
I keep seeing more low and mid servers in EU. Maybe it's because it's not weekend yet (but it was still more on Monday and tuesday), or a lot of people got suspended for the layer abuse.
---
Orc looks best as Hunter ;)
---
It's world pvp, "if you find yourself in a fair fight you're doing it wrong."
---
What’s wrong with the binds?
---
You're also the appropriate level for RFD, and should do the quests at Mirage Raceway in Thousand Needles. There's also Desolace.
---
Warrior without a doubt.

I notice mounts are “Binds When Used”. Is there anything stopping me from mailing gold to an alt of a different race, buying that race’s mount and mailing it to my main?
---
Did a reverse image search and found the model.  https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/ragnaros-775ed94a79634d9ea75f8a8df098cf5a
---
Depends on which weapons you get, you can't really plan ahead with how scarce the loot is. Arms is fine too if you get a good 2H.
---
Lots of triggered alliance in this thread
---
Buff someone in combat = enter combat. Buff someone flagged PvP = don't flag.
---
I seem to think it was opposite in vanilla.
---
Fireplaces count as a fire to use for cooking. I’m not sure about Braziers though
---
Where are you getting the numbers? By the way, I agree with you 100%. I still remember in general chat people reporting on the skyrocketing sub count. There was a fucking south park episode made about it. It's one of the best games of all time, and WoW was a massive success because of vanilla leveling. Even at WoW's peak, the original zone's and leveling experience were largely in tact.
---
Any kid able to do a google search can figuer out how to do a ddos attack...  nothing impressive.
---
There are also many security agency that can provide a ddos service, like if you want to stress test your servers against...  ddos.
---
Are people really taking more than 10 healers?
---
24/7
---
THEY ARE SHRINKING THE SERVERS CAP! There might be 20% of initial playerbase playing right now and server will still look like full. Ther are barely couple of layers for each realm right now, while 3 weeks ago there were tens of layers.

Same. Dno why it always happen to my Fear. Did I macro is wrongly? 🤔
---
Like inviting them to stay in voice chat during the dungeon? 
---
There is also the ingame voice chat i guess, never tried it tho. I don't know how many people would talk actually, but i can give it a try. Thanks!
---
Feels pretty 50 50 to me and all the polls before launch suggested the same
---
I did a reverse image search and found the .stl.
---
No the op is gay
---
Thanks, mate!
---
So all these guys posting videos like this are recording all the time just in case when things like this happens? :D
---
Always corious
---
this happens to any skinnable mob that drops E'ko.
---
about 7 pm Grob server time, or 10 pm (ish) EST
---
Fairbanks represent. I’m alliance as well.
---
Our DPS is so trash we basically have to be trolls though. .-.
---
There's sometimes one shaman enhance shaman for the melee group. Sometimes.
---
The others are all normally mana pumps for the casters and healers. So that build will be a lot hard to sell to a RL.
---
That’s the kind of world PvP I’m after! Both similar levels, full HP and no mobs. 1/2 the reason I’m doing a gathering prof is because it sets up that situation perfectly, but you can still run into ambushes and 2v1, which switches things up a bit
---
Could be an idea! I would like to level a Druid for example send me a PM with your contact so we can talk more if you want :D
---
I see this is now over-used &amp; over-done, purely for free Reddit karma
---
Ohh! come on. Dont be a "Sour Puss". See? another great nickname
---
So edgy.
---
Someone's gonna make an add-on that mods blizzard yellow.
---
I'm aware of that. I found a video on YouTube on how to get below Orgrimmar and it worked too. The only thing I'm missing is a method to get to GM Island
---
&gt;So I shouls reroll as a more "useful" class if i want to raid and do my guild favors?
---
Well typically yes, if you want to be more useful you have the option of picking a more useful class. This is really just going to end in one of those "There's no reason why you can't, but..." situations. 
---
You ask, you get an answer. I'm not here to argue about it. There's rarely ever a reason to bring a druid over a priest.
---
The dimensions on this one are wrong. The heroes on the bridge are way to big if you compare them to the skeleton on the bottom right.  Like the scenery makes it feel and look like a long ass bridge in a huge cave overpass, but the characters in back / foreground make it look like its a 5 meter bridge.
---
I'm guessing that the demon appeared on the child's 25 birthday, and offered the parents a double or nothing deal. If he can get to 30 they'll get 2 billion. They agree, and petition (successfully) for the release of WoW classic.
---
Leatherworking certainly isn’t ideal for a mage. If you’re hoping to make money, pick up mining instead of LW. Don’t worry about not making money on skinning at this level, as you get higher the market will spread out and heavier leathers will be worth more. As for choosing something else like tailoring or enchanting, it really depends on what your goals are.
---
Feel free to enlighten us then
---
One of my coworkers made the point that they were "advertising" a service. 
---
If this is the case then they'll have lawyers to mitigate the sentence with a pay check once they get out. Of course we won't hear about that bit. We'll have all but forgotten about it when they go to trial in 6 months- 2 years from now.
---
I already have mine wearing a stack of 20 Tarnished Silver Necklaces from ZF!
---
My guild is great, but most of them aren't on when I play at like 5am realm time so I get stuck with drunk baddies in my groups. xD
---
TitanPanel. Can't live without it
---
Arena’s the lowest level. 
---
I’m kinda surprised you’re seeing it so segmented though. On my realm people just run the full thing.
---
It stopped working silently a week ago, as well as related coddling changes (nerfs to enslave demon) which prevent most shenaningas. 
---
They haven't posted anything about it all despite hundreds of threads so it is possible it is an unrelated specific series of bugs that appeared out of nowhere but it seems likely that Blizzard are in general making the game 'safer'.
---
Why waiting for rested exp? Öo
---
I'm pretty sure they are not binded but you can't use them without the exalted rep
---
Hey man could you please post the macro text you use for that one? It would be greatly appreciated
---
It sounds amazing...
---
Well, it was 3g flat vs 3g 95s,to be exact
---
I have so much silver bars its insane
---
Every chest is just a free silver bar
---
What is that addon that show health/energy? just a weakaura?

All good my dude

I use Xbox DVR, a feature in windows 10 that records in the background and with a button press you can save the last few minutes of footage. Works (most of the time) as long as you have a decent CPU
---
Done
---
If you're doing it for acknowledgement you're doing it for the wrong reason. If you're not doing it for acknowledgement, then what do you care?
---
I literally only see Horde players pick fights with people 10+ (usually more) levels below them... big shocker there.
---
Yeah, I'm sorry but playing as a hunter bores me to tears.
---
&gt; Well if you look at the numbers, the mana spring totem will restore over 1300 (probably more I forget how much it ticks for) mana over a minute.
---
Mana tide totem only lasts 12 seconds. It restores 1300 mana over 12 seconds (to anyone in the radius) but has a 5 minute cooldown.
---
A major mana potion restores 1350-2250 mana and has a 2 minute cooldown.
---
It's very easy for even the most wheelchair of skids to perform an amplified or reflected DDoS, which makes it attractive for literal children.
---
Blizzard needs a good pentest assessment to be honest, I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.
---
same , if they red they ded
---
Make a human, any class. At level 1, run to stormwind and get enchanting. Anytime you pick up decent items like cloth, gear, etc, mail them to that level 1 character. Use that character only for storage, AH and disenchanting.
---
You niw have a classic bank alt!
---
THIS!!
---
This reminds me of the wallpapers that they used to have on the old wow website. Absolutely love it

Does elvui have the option to share settings? If so I’d like to try out yours

It's not always like this, i found some guilds that are just containers of people with no much interest in comunication. 
---
But if in classic it's different i think i'll make a try then!
---
[this is the only thing you need to consult about alliance hunter races](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRW0ryCHdT4). I'm sure you will make the right choice.
---
Why are you buffing their dick?
---
No need to waste time speccing holy as a priest.
---
You can heal dungeons absolutely fine as shadow, in fact, having spirit tap is a massive help in terms of in combat regen and has saved fights numerous times in bosses and over pulls.
---
Furthermore, you'll get plenty of time where healing isnt required... those times that +25% wand damage is a nice boon.
---
RACE WAR!!!!

Here's the thing, sooner or later we're going to get a few good years in and the sub numbers are going to start to wane, so what will Blizz do about that? That isn't directly relevant to changes in the current game but it does seem like something will change or be added sooner or later. 
---
Also, if Classic turns out to be a huge success....... why would they not be invested in that? They're in the business of making money, after all.
---
A guy undercut my flasks by over 20g. The profit margin over the cost of the herbs alone became near 0...
---
The mats are usually worth less than the vendor profit of the item itself. But you can compare if you check the AH or use an AH searching addon
---
They are the same thing, idk why it's sometimes worded differently. Spell damage does not apply to wands, just spells. You get less spell damage than that in practice because of spell coefficients; but both abilities will take the spell coef modifier.
---
I had no idea about feral druids. That suuuuuuuucks.
---
Are you joking? Vegans reduce animal cruelty massively, but there is nothing special about being a dad (most people do it).
---
Being a *good* dad is special, though.
---
he just hit them with his bow as far as I can tell.
---
It applies a weapon buff
---
You should go to another location, level in dungeons for a couple levels, or just skip any quest 2 levels higher than you. It's not worth it as like you said, you basically use all your resources on one enemy.
---
Hunter straight BM is the answer for "strongest pet" by a long shot. It isn't good for anything end game, since it has zero gear scaling, but that's the strongest pet for sure.
---
Warlock pets are pretty bad in terms of straight combat, they're more utility tools compared to hunter pets.
---
I was far too panicked to be thinking rationally haha
---
Hmm. Never thought about that. I'm just thinking playing with 1 hand, never leaving instance door, easy-peasy healing only.
---
Like it? I love it.
---
People seem to think continuing the spell cleave grind into BRD is a good idea. If you want to do it you will farm the arena portion over and over. However, there have been several other posts on here that have also pointed out that doing so is actually the same/slightly slower than continuing questing. Open world/further dungeon quests. Also continuing to quest towards the raids to "unlock them". Further to that point you also will loose out on most of the necessary pre bis gear required for higher dungeons and raiding by sticking to a BRD arena farm group. Beyond that, it sounds boring as shit bro. From what I've seen its about 6 hours of grinding the same trash in BRD for a single level; however, it's wow....do it your way my dude.
---
The warrior's only instant IIRC is sundering strike until level 40, and that just softens the target.  
---
I don't remember classic really being exciting except through nostalgia goggles or as a physical DPS like a rogue or hunter.  Looking at it objectively, a lot of classes were either cast bars upon cast bars or auto attack bots.
---
He will run out of quests pretty quickly and then be stuck grinding for exp.
---
NO ONE TOSSES A DWARF!
---
Not really surprised considering it was a mage. They have some sense of entitlement because of AoE groups (not all, just some)

Ddos isn't only about sending a lot of packets to a server.  It is also about sending malformed, incorrect packets that will slow the processing of each connection even more.
---
You have many types of ddos attacks : SYN flood, ping of death...  and you don't have to attack your target : attacks can target ISP or DNS server upstream.
---
Oh, and ddos is already implying it involves many computers, as the first D is there for Distributed :)
---
This sounds like a great add-on. I'm gonna check it out later.
---
I've reported ~20 people now for this. It's been happening constantly on Bigglesworth. Hope it's fixed soon, back in vanilla this kind of thing got you a temp ban too.
---
Don't listen to the haters, I love it!
---
Sure, yeah. I just want them to acknowledge the Infernal issue. Would suck if it was intentional.
---
Flew over Elwynn Forest just as a guy was explaining the difference between furry porn and beastiality. Unfortunately i couldnt hear the whole explaination.
---
This is my argument when people complain about botters crashing the market. Those botters make liquid gold (i.e. vendoring and quests) more valuable, which actually makes 'real players' richer for doing normal stuff.
---
No kidding, I would love one done like this but for the outside of SM coming up the hill, or maybe in the courtyard of cathedral
---
The spiritual wolf is for all shapersons who have achieved the level of 20. Namaste.

i have a lvl 20 priest that is a tailor, so i wanted to do something different with the mage, 2 horde tailors seemed dumb when i started lol
---
Longer than I'd like to admit
---
I’ve noticed that just applying a seal to myself on my pally will sometimes put threat on me, even if I haven’t started combat yet! Next thing I know, I have one or two dungeon mobs racing toward me before I’ve even started swinging.
---
It’s a 10% difference from what you suggested, so you tell me
---
first is correct
---
Not all pets have the same damage. Petopia has a more detailed breakdown but basically every pet has its stats budgeted between health, armor, and dps. Offensive pets like cats, spiders, raptors are heavily skewed toward damage and lose defensive stats, while boars, bears, and turtles sacrifice dps for survivability.
---
Cant help but sounds like a great idea
---
The project constraints are different. There's not suddenly going to be azerite gear popping out because that's just not a thing in classic. Same with titanforging. And almost everything about the new game. Though I could definitely see them adding some warfront garbage... Maybe you're right.
---
Ah but how many of those level 1s are 2nd bank alts? lol Really I dont know man, I have no data on this. Thats why in the original post I was going off of no data.

Oh ok, I just saw your comment and wasn't sure if you were asking for real or not.

---
Yes they're banned, but I mean they might be banned for more than a month once they know how severe the users have exploited.
---
Tanks don't need VE, if somebody is actively tanking a mob they are taking way more damage than VE is designed to give back. However, Group comp for shadow is contested between melee dps vs a warlock group. Melee dps can last forever in incidental damage fights if a shadow priest is healing them all or warlocks could weave lifetap in constantly and never run out of mana or health.
---
I disagree :)
---
No the loot is shared between those who completed the quest. Only you? Loot is yours.
---
I agree with all that, however, based on history, and stuff, we have no real guarantee Blizzard will protect the permanency of your characters in their game world. It seems more likely, now that classic is a thing, but based on Blizz's track record. They have no issue trivializing your months of effort just to release new content.
---
I mean it's MOSTLY just because I don't want children haha, but yes, in an already overpopulated world, I don't need to add my crappy genes back into the pool. It's a miracle they got this far to begin with.
---
Yeah, they gave 3-day bans in vanilla for this. It's happening constantly on Bigglesworth

No. I think it was honestly something like 21/20/something and saying that the talents work together to be more than the some of their parts.

not calling you out, but I would bet most people that say this are the mad cartels that run the market and are just waiting to regain control of their corner

True, pretty long CD and requires SL build though.

Slow Loris is fascinating and a great way to take down a web server (apache, nginx, etc), I guess this kid figured out something similar to attack the WoW game service, or he conscripted some darknet Russians to do it for him

Just like my windfury procs and crits as an enhancement shaman... Why should you feel any better?
---
Classic/vanilla warrior by far! As someone who on retail has the same warrior I started with day 1 vanilla; the tried to roll warrior on classic....it's night and day, and not in a good way. Even classic/vanilla warrior compared to TBC warrior is crazy different.
---
That will get shut down by blizz dont even bother, it happened on retail already.
---
How many mages are down voting this post right now? xD
---
I find the nostalgia argument hilarious. It's never brought up when talking about other media. A bands' older stuff is usually better, the original movies are usually better than the reboots and sequels, etc. Yeah sure classic has its problems, but it's fun and that's what matters.
---
Yeah I haven’t worried about it prior to starting since it doesn’t drop too often. Figure I’ll just keep checking with the healer prior to rolling

You should be fine healing dungeons as shadow until roughly level 50-55. The endgame 5-mans (LBRS, scholo, strat, eventually Dire Maul, arguably ST, later portions of BRD, etc) put more pressure on the tank and healer to actually be specced into those roles. Up through at least ZF, healers can heal in a DPS spec without issue.
---
The typical leveling spec progression for priests is wand spec + spirit tap + anything you want until level 40, respec to shadowform at 40 then immediately put 5 points back into wand spec, then respec as a healer at something like 58 and grind dungeons to 60. If you want to minimize respec costs, you can opt for a hybrid build (something like 21/x/5, taking wand spec and spirit tap, and possibly improved shadow word pain) while you level, then only respec once either at or near 60. The upside is that you can be more confident in your ability to heal dungeons, but the downside is slower kill times while doing solo content.
---

This should help. Also remember any spell below lvl 20 will not be as efficient in spell power but can still be used for utility and speed.
---
Same but doing it on a bus. Have a nice life (:
---
I do, it just never clicked.
---
I like how he captured the ragtag look of groups at that level
---
repost, bro..
---
Go back and read his comment. He said 95% of the (PvP) servers, which is not completely unfounded. Anathema is one of the only Alliance dominated PvP realms on US.
---
Is there like a shitty generic guilds invite guide out there somewhere? I see this all the time on Myzrael.
---
hahaha what, why would they shut it down?
---
Do you have an article or whatever about this?
---
&gt; that he was just directly tweeting from home 
---
or tweeting from the iphone + mobile plan mom was paying for.
---
yeah this guy is overzealous. there's also a set amount of content and I don't think WoW has replay-ability.
---
When players have played all the content they are interested in, they will leave. When I played retail in Legion, I was a casual member of my friends' mythic raiding guild. I got ahead of the curve on KJ, but I never raided as part of the main party, I went on alt night, because I didn't have time etc.
---
When argus dropped, I got curve there, and then I quit. I knew realistically I wouldn't ever get to mythic status, so there was nothing left to do.
---
I think when phase 2 and beyond start dropping, it will only revive the game for the guys who are at the top end of the content. most casual players won't end up getting there, so there won't be any reason to keep pushing through
---
What about the rare cat in The Barrens ? (Not Echeyakee but a black lion / panther )
---
I’m not a goon but I’ve heard of this guild. I’m on mankrik.
---
Yeah this isn't what's happening with me either. I can do a wand shot and move/cancel during the global cooldown, but I will still wand again. It's a bit janky at times. Sometimes I cancel BEFORE a wand shot but it will still shoot the wand, wait for the global cooldown, shoot AGAIN, and then I can cast a spell.
---
I have a 120 rogue and 120 warrior. The biggest change I think is self-sustain. In vanilla, neither have either. However, rogue still has most of the toolkit in vanilla that it does in retail, but with better burst. Abilities actually deal meaningful damage. Like one of the other posts alludes to, warrior tanking is a lot more preemptive in vanilla compared to the reactive abilities retail has. 10s cd taunt with melee range requirement means if you lose threat, you’re running around like a chicken with your head lopped off since dps still haven’t learned, in 15 years of playing WoW, to run to the tank. 
---
Overall, my answer would be warrior.
---
Slower weapons tend to have better top damage
---
Thanks, but i still cant find it. I just reached 20 and i see in my talent tree that there is a wolf skill or something. Im just playing with totens and some damage spells right now.
---
Anyone else hope they open up paid or even (optimistically) free Faction/Server transfers? 
---
The launch was so chaotic half my friends ended up on a different server or faction. At this point I would pay to move my highest level character to a different server/faction instead of having to re-level.
---
If only the launch day wasn't just a scrabble to whichever server didn't have a 12 hour long queue ):
---
It's worth as much are people are willing to pay for, just like everything else. Find a person willing to trade and strike a deal.
---
&gt;The PvP trinket will even that out a LOT.
---
And then locks will have good Stam gear and spec into soul link...
---
No, never. Warrior for life. All the drawbacks of warriors pale in comparison to being able to build your own groups, with a competent tank, in a fraction of the time a DD would need. Also, in 5 man dungeons I can make sure I'm the only plate wearer, if there's a specific piece I'm farming. No/minimal competition for loot is just great.
---
Yes, some people sour the experience by being godawful (I'm not talking about skill/numbers) DDs, but hey, if they annoy me too much, either the dungeons ends where we stand or that dumbass gets kicked and replaced in less than 2 minutes.
---
&gt; Got feared into a dungeon, the fear didn't expire after zoning in,
---
That's the SSD life... If you had a crappier computer you'd have been fine.
---
The BB/Ratchet boat ride is tense as fuck. It has yet to go bad for me but I always gear up with a healthstone + soulstone + voidwalker + fresh demon armor and keep my head on a swivel the entire trip.
---
Probably safer if you go up top and jump to the front of the boat, but personally I'll stick with the staredown on the main deck.
---
As much of a dick move this was there is nothing to report them over. You can't report people for simply being dicks, just like you can't report someone for ninja looting. Corpse camping, ninja looting, kicking people etc is not reportable. People like that has to be punished by the community.
---
I see how what i wrote might be misinterpreted. Sorry for that, what i meant is:
---
The others are all normally healers and mana pumps for the casters.
---
But still looking at your points, doesn't change my argument:
---
* A shaman that can enhance and has MT is going to be more useful to the raid than your build.
---
* A Shaman CH healer with MT is going to be more useful than your build.
---
* A shaman with MT also has reincarnation.
---
That's what i meant by saying that your build will be hard to sell to a RL.
---
But it won't do well this time because it's not the same game. /s
---
Sorry, didn't consider defense &amp; balanced pets to be tamed at max level. But higher speed or lover speed level offensive pets has kinda same DPS. It might hard to tame 1.0 attack per sec rare cat, but there are lots of 1.2 attack per sec cats in thousand needles etc.
---
So, a bait-filled troll thread.  Interesting. Any substance, or are you just trying to get reactions out of people like most Classic-community-trolls are?
---
Laughs in Druid
---
Yes I know. You could have gotten it from Winterspring in Vanilla aswell
---
I won't pretend to know the answer, but if you join the shaman discord, there are literal experts in there that may be able to answer that for you.

I have rolled my first Warrior in WoW, and have him leveled up to 26. It feels like most of the guides I’ve found for Warrior recommend speccing Arms and using 2H weapons while leveling. Yesterday I found my first dagger that was my highest DPS weapon, so I threw it on with a shield and leveled its skill. 
---
While I was using the dagger, I started to realize that with the faster attack speed of it I was landing more crits which also cause the target to bleed, and also drawing more dodges that would let use my Overpower ability, which has a crit buff. I also liked having the extra armor from having a shield equipped. 
---
All of this made me wonder, why are 2H weapons the recommended favorite for leveling? Is there some other detail that i’m missing that makes those weapons more effective?
---
Also, as someone who has always stuck to Mage or Warlock in Retail and started out Classic with a Warlock which I got up to 32, Warrior has been a LOT of fun to learn. I’m loving learning to tank, and the class itself just feels so satisfying to play.
---
Warriors just have basically 0 tools in classic.  They're completely and utterly dependant on teammates for any and all utility.
---
Rogues have kept many of their core cooldowns/abilities throughout most or all of wow stuff like vanish blind kidney etc.
---
Just farmed a bunch of these in STV last night, which is awkward as horde..
---
A hunter was asking in Barrens chat if Humar was up. I made an offhand joke that if you don't wait 5 days for Humar, you don't deserve him. He /w'd me and we got to chatting. Turns out he had already got Humar and abandoned him when he stumbled upon Broken Tooth. As someone who spent many days waiting for Humar to spawn and used him from Vanilla to Wrath, I was appalled.
---
Risky click of the day, but it turned out good.
---
I straight up had a quest  giving item tell me " This Quest is not Available to your Race" ....
---
Racist ass necklace I didnt want to do the quest anyways
---
Would exit out of the game so fast
---
No. I do use twitch few a few addons but none for bags.
---

That honestly depends on your server; supply and demand.  End game, skinning will get you Dinosaur Leather and the ability to skin some bosses (such as Onyxia for her Scales).  Across all servers over a long period of time, Mining/Skinning/Herbalism should even out in terms of gold making.
---
It's about how many people it affects.
---
In case of a rape, only one victim, and its family.
---
In case of ddos, you hit thousand, if not millions of people.  OK, in this case it was a game, but imagine the attack also perturbed a hospital a collateral damage (if the hospital was on the same ISP as the game provider for example).  Those perturbation would make the hospital medical appointment software bug, leading to sick people not being treated in time, potentially leading to more severe health issues for some, or even death...
---
So many things relies on computers and networks nowadays, you can't just disrupt those services and think you're not doing a lot of trouble...
---
I hope that script kiddy gets a multi hundreds of thousand dollar fine and a lifetime of community service.
---
&gt; you are not supposed to die as a horde
---
I believe.you are.  For the Alliance!
---
No doubt the game's population will dwindle if Classic receives no further content updates after Blizzard rolls out the last phase of announced content. They will need to adopt a Classic+ model at some point and update the game with new content faithful to the Classic era, quality of life updates, etc. 
---
Old School Runescape is the perfect example - the #nochanges group nearly resulted in the community's decline. It wasn't till a few years later that a healthy community returned to the game in lieu of player driven content updates on a monthly basis.
---
I got that, it's as you mention they come in with a "BFA mindset" i'd rather spare us all from the endless QQ we would have to endure is all.
---
I second this. Seems like this happens a bunch, can the mods at least operate with a little more transparency and maybe respond to this so the members of this sub know the why and scope.
---
Two golds
---
To the troops!  All the troops!  Both sides!

Yup do this. I made IRL friends that are still there with vocal, some are even in my city. I play this kind of games since 17 years now.
---
Yep should have incorporated the ralph meme
---
Yeah, Pagle did have character transfers recently and it reduced the queues a lot.  But there were still small queues after the instituted it.  It's possible this was just the slow trickle of players out of Pagle due to transfers.  But still, every day it seems fewer guildies are on, including last night and this morning.

Fighting for everything with 20 other people, and trying to use that stupid LFG channel is an exercise in stupidity.
---
I spent 2 days spamming LFG Cath/RFD and didn't get anywhere. Without a decent LFG system it's only the hardcore that are going to stick it out.
---
There should only be local LFG channels. 1.11 when they changed it to the global LFG channel was retarded. It's making ppl rage quit.
---
Some of the mechanics in Classic just suck the enjoyment out of the game.
---
Sorry but TBC was a hell of a lot more fun than rehashing Vanilla.
---
Yes. You login and you'll see a little circle icon with a number counting down or "C+" in it. The number is the scans the addon is doing for players. Once finished it displays a chat message showing how many new unique players it has seen. At that point you can upload to the site, or play for a while and have it find more.
---
It's a replacement site for Warcraftrealms as they don't support Classic yet.
---
You might want to ticket a GM. They can see your item history and say it was never existed or you've destroyed it etc.
---
If you’re eating shadowbolts for 20 seconds without a fear break you might be the unluckiest person in the world
---
Joanna's Guide and his videos specifically says and shows that he grinds mobs, he just grinds mobs in linear paths to quest locations and then back to quest givers. There is not enough xp provided by guests rewards to level to 60, many quests are grind quests that attempt to hide the need to kill a large of number of mobs to get to 60 but you just flat have to kill a lot of mobs to get to 60.
---
I dont want to say your are just an idiot, but I do not think such a bug exists. Probably bank was full, you vendored it afrerwards.
---
*AHEM* Thats the world of warcraft that you play!
---
But seriously, if you dont like being rekt by a ?? Opposite faction player, dont play PvP servers. I leveled to 40 on my Tauren Druid and had my fair share of ?? Ally stomping my face in outside of BFD, SM, Hillsbrad and a few other places. Also on my 30 Warrior i’ve had the same experiences, Its a PvP server, learn your decision.
---
In the wise words of Sylvanas, “You call for peace when it suits you, little lion.”
---
So call me crazy, but if I see a low level ally heave-ho’ing round the wide world of Azeroth questing and thinking things are all honky-dory when they /wave at me, well, they’re getting sent to the nearest spirit healer ASAP.
---
And as long as “Dishonorable Kills” don’t exist yet, lowbies are going to be harassed all over.
---
Get used to it, or go play a Normal server.

Newbish question about rogues in dungeons.
---
I've been playing WoW for quite some time, but never played a rogue. I changed things up for vanilla and rolled one. I'm just now starting to do dungeons (lvl 20) and I'm wondering how to do things "properly". 
---
I'm speccing into combat swords, currently have a mace and a quick sword. So the only stealth opener I can really do is garrote. 
---
Is it expected to sneaky sneak behind mobs and open, or just stay behind the tank and follow them into the fray unstealthed? Like how does that work and what am I expected to do when it comes to fights (mobs and bosses)? 
---
I've read up on rotation and etiquette and such btw. Any advice is appreciated!
---
Been doing distract shenanigans myself as well. It's so much fun.
---
&gt;  What other debuffs do you need?
---
Mind flay, Devouring Plague.
---
Is there any addon that enhances the ingame map to function like wowheads? I love how theirs has toggles to show flight masters, trainers, etc. (ex.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/duskwood](https://classic.wowhead.com/duskwood) ).
---
The shadow talents prior to shadow form don't matter much for leveling, with the exception of the Spirit Tap in the first tier. You say you don't care about soloing, but practically speaking you will need to do some soloing, and Spirit Tap is essential for that. So if you want to go Disc/Holy, get Spirit Tap first, then Wand Spec in the Disc tree, and then start taking whatever you want in the Disc and Holy trees.
---
I'm level 33, all Shadow except for Wand Spec. If I had it to do over, I'd probably do those levels as Spirit Tap + Disc/Holy, but since at this point I'm not respeccing because I do want to get shadow form for 40-60. It's very good for PvP, and I get a lot of PvP going on as I level.
---
That sounds like a really good rate.
---
Dude, turn on a light! It's not healthy to stare at monitors in the dark for hours.
---
No it will not effect your spells, only spell power does.
---
I think a lot of people were playing literally as much as possible. Personally, I hit my physical limit around Monday this week and had to take a break to get some sleep and eat better and do some chores. I’m back at it again though, can’t wait to log back on.
---
I tend to avoid the parts of the game that I can't do.  So if there's a dungeon or quest that I know will be a poor roi for my time, I'll just not do it.  I guess near level cap though there are probably things you have to do.
---
Shocking alliance complaining about a few horde rather than band together and fight them off.

So have Blizzard made any statements regarding the animation bug we see in this video? Looks like the Alliance is strafing in the first seconds of the video. Looks pretty broken.
---
Is there a mailbox in Moonglade? I looked, couldn't find any.
---
Thanks I was going crazy trying to figure this out a few weeks ago.
---
It definitely wasn't PVE-&gt;PVP. They didn't want you leveling on a PVE server just to transfer to a PVP server without having earned your way up.
---
in all seriousness, im gonna try to get rank 10 for the blue set.

Wait What Happened?

Goddamn peasants all lack manors. That’s why they’ll always be below us noble folk, who have many manors

Even if I won the roll the chest drops anything that could be a upgrade to a party member I offer it for free.
---
You are so full of crap.
---
can i ask why?
---
Since when? It was working last night for me.
---
Yeah I was in one of those as well, but then I was invited by some guy I was questing with into a much smaller guild and the community is great there. Not everyone is lvling at the same speed, but still we do quite a lot of dungeons and quests together and it is actually pretty fun dragging a lvl 22 through Gnomeregan. 
---
Keep trying out different guilds until you find one you are comfortable with! And don´t be afraid to /gquit those, which you don´t like
---
I basically never group up unless I have to, but then I'm also a hunter.

The idea of 'low effort' as described by the mod action is basically art elitism, pure and simple. These mods have NO IDEA how much effort went into any submission made, they just make assumptions and hand out judgement based on their collective beliefs about art. Collage and other similar forms use preexisting assets to create something new, and the point is not whether or not you are producing the entirety of the thing yourself, but whether the end result works... which is often up to the audience, hence we have an upvote/downvote system.
---
It's plain wrong to institutionalize blanket discrimination against submissions that lean on a witty understanding of the game, and on the lovingly campy nature of many classic WoW assets and MSpaint.
---
but it's true, unless you guys were super underleveled for the dungeon...
---
Wand damage doesn't get added to your speels if that's what you're asking. Wand damage type is usually a pretty minor detail.
---
You want to go all in but didn’t google the idea first? It’s been attempted at least twice, shutdown by copyright laws.  [first result for wow voiceover addon](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20761938152)
---
Bags were definitely not full. After the run I had like 6 empty spots and I checked the buyback tab and it wasn't there.
---
Imma be a bit controversial, spend that 5 points somewhere else. Just my opinion
---
Use it to flex on people obviously
---
Cause you can't be sapped.
---
Most people who don't plan to resub stopped putting time into WoW and already dropped off, though.
---
and here i was using the protanopia colourblind filter on \~30% just to *reduce* the feeling that a toddler barfed half digested crayons all over my screen...  
---
secondly, why would you need to rebuild reshade to apply some crappy shaders? i cant see anything ehre that couldn't be done with reshade itself?
---
&gt; does wands increase my spell damage at one point?
---
At some point, yes, but not the early wands.
---
ie.: [This wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5604/elven-wand) deals Arcane damage, while [this wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13938/bonecreeper-stylus) increases spell damage (all schools of magic) and [this wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11263/nether-force-wand) only increases Arcane spell damage.

In raids or dungeons you could use your mage armor because there you are most likely not getting hit
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
The problem is however many layers they have, and every dungeon/quest/retards spamming one channel. It's useless. Unless you are in a zerg guild you are Fked.
---
Incendius was only 'high' last night. I'll gladly take a population decline to high if that means no queues.
---
Arent wands autoattacks? I am not sure, but then your probably need /stopattack instead of /stopcast ?
---
Add New cool raids with hard mechanics is only thing i really do want to be added. Increase the Gear stars but still be lvl 60.  Or is this Breaking some things?  I really hope to do karazhan again but seems a bit unlikely
---
But if  you foster a culture of communication and generosity you will have people saying “ I’ve got 10 thick leather from fishing who needs it...” and then the leather worker makes something for the lower level Rogue/hunter.
---
That has also been my experience on my mage and I'm only 25.

These AoE Stock runs I've been doing on my 29 druid lately are just driving me nuts. After every pull I just want to ragequit. lol I can't wait to get to Gnomer.

Depends on what yer fighting. Casters or pummelers?

I am a vending machine on my mage.  Int buffs, water, food, you got it.  Half of the fun for me in this game is helping out others around me.
---
No problem. I'm so happy I found a working Grid version, been suffering with a Grid-esque ElvUI setup, but really, really hate some aspects of ElvUI. I think I'll go with Shadowed UI + Grid and set it up tomorrow, Grid still needs some work regarding indicators etc. I initially had some issues with changing the Font size of names, as I just tried to do it in the General options - but you have to navigate to the actual Grid space where the name is located (Text Down in my case) and change the font size there. Now I gotta set up the different corner indicators so I know when there's a Disease/Poison to cleanse, etc. 
---
Also awesome to have a working Incoming Heals show up when you heal so you get an approximate idea of how big a chunk of the missing HP you're replacing, and plan your next heal before the current one is finished casting.
---
Whinning on reddit.

So, when the horde players do something nice it's like OMG WHAT A EXAMPLE OF HUMAN BEING HORDE IS SO NICE AND SHIT WE ARE THE BEST THE GAME IS AWESOME WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER. But then, when a horde player do something stupid like that, I'm the wrong one for wanting to play in peace?
---
Right. Horde players really live up to the meme to be offended when criticized...

Am I the only one who only undercuts by 1c? I thought that was standard practice.
---
One thing that thread you linked totally nailed is wanding.  I spent my first five points in wand spec and that along with SWP is incredible dps.  If you're being efficient with your heals (i use one lower tier of heal generally to save mana) and using your heal over time and PWS on squishies that get brief aggro spikes, there is soooooo much downtime to wand the crap out of mobs.  
---
I had a guy yesterday make a comment about just how much freaking wand dmg i was doing while also keeping the whole group topped off on health.  
---
Anyway, it seems like a really fun way to play provided you're not planning to go out and quest solo.  I'm loving it though i do expect some diminishing returns in the 20s, 30s and beyond.
---
I think the vast majority of wow classic players are adults who signed up for auto bill. I doubt there will be much drop-off if any.
---
Well then don't roll a RP server.
---
Yup. I do that too, traveling around, selling stuff, looking ah for upgrades, cleaning up quest log. Several hours spent and not even a bar of xp.
---
But I know I did that on purpose. If I wanted to grind out quests I'd abandon the red/ elite / dungeon ones fly to the nearest zone, empty my bags and go.
---
Yup flamelash at times feels like you're outnumbered  10 to 1
---
I usually don't mind the 40s wall, but honestly, there's just too  many people. I didn't care competing for the lower lvls, but for some reason at 43, all the zones are overflowing and you literally cannot quest. You either fight for spawns if you are with your fellow faction or inevitably skirmish with the opposite faction. I don't want to grind honestly, I love questing, but its so frustrating rn I can't do it  
---
ADD MORE LAYERS LOL
---
If you go on settings (right clicking on the chat tab), you can choose what you want to see. Simply uncheck whisper and you’re good to go! Personally I make a separate window for lfg chat :)
---
Haha no need to apologize, it’s more common than you might think. Enjoy all those new spells you’ve been missing out on!
---
lol wow
---
I'm not blowing my inventory space on that man. At 60 I will.
---
Unfortunately that’s the life of a guildless player.
---
That’s because you are more casual and he *is hardcore* but doesn’t want to admit it for whatever reason.
---
I'm level 47 as Enhancement and I still heal most of my dungeons. It's actually really good since about 80-90% of my damage is auto-attacking anyway, I can heal while providing a moderate amount of damage, all without using much mana.
---
Ign sourjack, I'm waiting.
---
Classic, for me, has reinforced how refined and QoL improved the retail game is... that being said, it has its charm - but I don't particularly enjoy spending 45 mins to put a Dead Mines dungeon run together, only for the priest to disconnect 5 minutes in.
---
It’s really ineffable. I think part of the addiction is that the experience is just constantly fun. For me anyways. What makes something fun is hard to analyze. Fun starts to slip through your fingers when you try to get a hold on it. 
---
I had 9 days played last Monday btw
---
A soccer league for children
---
^ what he said.. it's in your graphics. It's on 3 or classic by default but you can change it.
---
&gt;I don't find it that complicated. Like, there's a lot of totems, but a lot of them you will cast so infrequently they don't deserve a spot on your action bars (stoneclaw, disease/poison cleansing, etc).
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Drop SoE and either WF or GoA depending on your party for dungeons, save searing for fights taking more than a few seconds, magma when you're fighting 3+ things. Tremor when you need fear protection. That's honestly 90% of your use cases and can be covered by 3-4 buttons.
---
Im sorry but you sound like a lazy player. One that doesnt dispels, that doesnt help. You are pretty much an inneficient shaman and on my opinion a lazy shaman is the worst case scenario.  
---
Ive played one to lvl 30 and changed to paladin and the difference is brutal. Shamans are supposed to be useful. You have a trick for every single little situation.. You have to have a full bar for everything that should be possible to do. Vanilla and Classic are about the little things.. its one poison you dont cleanse that kills you.. its one purge you could use that helps..  
---
You can be one more in the crowd just like you. Or you can train your brain to not be lazy and excel in your class.. its your choice.. but being a subpar shaman is just... bad. Choose another class, most of them doesnt require as much.
---
&gt; If you're doing it for acknowledgement you're doing it for the wrong reason
---
Yeah that’s true. I think I’ll quit ressing and buffing people now.
---
We thought we did but we didn't?
---
It's all mods when they all agree to enforce the rule, and when they all share a lack of insight into the creation process of the memes they lock (especially crappy ones).
---
Which isn't to say the mods are all jerks or anything-- but as I mentioned, they are enforcing the policy as a collective which automatically dirties them all. The main problem is the rule itself, but if the mods agree to use it then obviously the mods are at fault, because the rule didn't exactly create itself..
---
How do you think they get berserker stance?
---
He was probably sippin' his soda =)
---
Replied in the wrong thread my bad
---
its by far the best game of 2019, 2018 and 2017 combined
---
modern game devs are mentally handicapped people , idk what the fuck they do at game studios, but for sure they stopped coding good products.
---
ill be resubbing even in 2020
---
Or very intentional to stop the constant posts using the census to show how dead the servers are convincing people to stay on their current server.
---
Wow that's some real MLG play from your druid. The sides of the map are different colors.
---
That may be the case in everlook, but there are plenty of blind spots in gadgetzan, booty bay, and everlook
---
Your not wrong, but some people just enjoy the class type. Some people also enjoy the challenge too.
---
I'm pretty sure the "Spell" for ranged attack is called Auto Shot, so try /cast Auto Shot
---
By default the graphics are at 3.
---
However you can crank that up to modern and get nicer lighting, water, some textures, etc. If you're looking for the new spell effects and models, we'll that'd take a lot of work to be toggle-able.
---
I’m a shaman and I don’t get it
---
Does the leveling slow down at 40? I hit 30 surprisingly fast and I'm kind of worried I'm going to fast  but if it slows down I'll just stay the course.
---
We always knew we thought we did. The question is, did we didn't?
---
I understand that u want some advertisement but is there a clean version of it as well? Would love it as background but without all the text in the bottom :) thanks
---
Yeah I made good money at the beginning of the server, when nobody was fishing. I fished level 1 fish for 1 Silver a pop. Then I fished these there for 8 silver a pop.
---
There are wands enchanters can make that you can get at level 5 and level 13 that do amazing damage compared to other gear that level.  Highly reccommended that you pick them up when available.  You can either buy them from the auction house, or if you're in guild with cool/helpful people they might make them for you.
---
Not in classic at this point
---
I managed to achieve my goal of 250 black lotus. Therefor I've made this guide &amp; it's ment for those who want to farm black lotuses in classic.
---
Wonderfully done - thank you for sharing!
---
when you start using exploits to bug out guards or other crap like that is when you get banned.  just ganking lowbies isnt in and of itself a bannable offense.   Either he or someone in his group was doing something they shouldnt have been doing. he may be telling the truth and be oblivious to it or he may be a big fat liar. we will probably never know.
---
As a Druid? Don't worry, nobody else thought of you like that as well.
---
If you lose your shit when someone says something in guild chat it might be time to make an appointment with a psychiatrist.
---
They define low effort meme as one that wouldn't be related to wow with the text or overlaid images removed.... so pretty much all memes unless the original image is from WoW.
---
Are they Oily Blackmouth or Deviant Fish?
---
Still in the game to get a Sulfuras or Thunderfury though!
---
If you can find a stable group of people to spam dungeons with, that's by far the fastest way, however that can be kinda hard, so I would just quest unless a group is offering to summon you to a dungeon or you have quests for it.
---
More damage?
---
Making separate windows is the solution I used. I have 3 windows, 1 of them is just spam I dont usually care about
---
How long does the 200% xp boost last when you log back on after resting within an inn? Also what is the minimum time you need to log out to renew the xp boost?
---
I was for my warlock q in barrens on lvl 26 while horde was lvl 15 cca, i helped them on my way killing their mobs, i also used my course of tongues so they dont spend much mana on them
---
That's what I'm all about right now. I did all this stuff 12-13 years ago... I just wanted to try something new to me
---
Firefin Snapper are worth fuck all on my server.
---
Same for me, as Alliance on Stalagg. Horde may have numbers, but they have no skills and generally only act tough when trying to gank you 5 v 1.
---
I only lost a "fair" fight once, so far, and that was against a Lock 2 levels higher than me who spammed Fear + DoTs until I died.
---
Great for pvp especially against another mage trying to use frostbolt because you'll push back their cast and get great value
---
Dick end? That's a new one... I like it.
---
Good call, I'll try it out and let you know.
---
For years, you mean. It's brighter than it looks, just crappy camera on a crappy old phone
---
Feels more epic when you're alliance and you have to spend 2 hours death-running through Orgrimmar to get there.
---
That may be a classic style of play, but was not done so much in vanilla :)
---
Neeed more! This is awesome!!
---
There's an addon that hides whispers from non-friends. Auto blocks party invites until you click a button that deactivates in 15 secs etc. But can't remember it's name.
---
Enchanting is great because once everyone has gear in dungeons you can disenchant for shards that sell pretty decent once the economy is going.
---
Anyone else "read" this in CAPS?
---
I think memes are overused and over appreciated regardless of the amount of time someone put into it.
---
Might be because he's playing a Hunter
---
That's donee with consoleport. It's a website and addon that help you map everything. I  haven't done it, so I don't know the details, but just Google consoleport and I'm  fairly certain it takes less than an hour to set up.
---
Cloth is so cheap on my server, that it is worth it to buy it just to make bandages out of them and then sell it to a vendor.
---
It's handy for finishing stuff off when a fire blast isn't quite enough on its own but fireball is too long a cast. Same thing if you can't stand still long enough to cast fireball.
---
That's Classic for you!
---
You do have to be 5 I think.
---
Consider the slot machine auto attacking the down time of the enhance shaman. While you hit the focused target, your maintaining party totems, which needs can change as diseases/poisons start to spread, so you work in your cleanse totems. Battle mage is about to blast wave? You drop your fire resist totem to really help with that burst. Spell being cast, interrupt with an earth shock , drop a grounding totem to absorb another spell then earth shock the next cast to bring it in. Healer got interrupted , lay down the big heal to save the day. Tank pull hella big? Help heal and save mana for if the priest runs out(which he won't because of your PHAT mana spring totem). Heals drinking? Keep up the group's pace by owning the healing if the next pull, yes your not going to forever heal but that little mana pool can be sufficient for a controlled pull. This won't even matter because your JUICED up Windfury totem and strength of earth will pump the damage of thor melle to melt the faces of mobs. No mobs=no damage
---
Runner? Frost shock. Shock on CD? Slap a slow totem down. Healer have threat ? Storm Strike/Earth Shock/ WF high roll and that mobs off your squishy and on your tushy. Large aoe pull? Strategically place that nova totem so the INSANE threat it rips doesn't cause it to get shmacked before it pops, magma totem and your ripping some quality AOE. 
---
The bottom line is yes, your not the damage power house of other classes, your never going to be. Your the support class of support classes . You are ENHANCE. (Raid role is definitely more boring, but this is at least dungeons for pre BIS farming for me)
---
Cause it's the only class they can truly beat 1v1
---
Couldn't of said it any better. Well put /u/RoeJaz
---
This was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks a ton!
---
Makes sense for sure. I was thinking of ot more as an investment for higher levels
---
Nice, fair enough reasoning. I guess any way you choose has its downsides to some degree, I'll probably do the same and keep things the way I have it until further notice. If they indeed are on different CD timers then you could probably smash them fairly quickly consecutively ha. 
---
Anyways thanks again for taking the time out to help us man. Appreciate it
---
This is what I feared. I wasn't dead but possibly could of been out of range from the boss.
---
Yes, run in, pull middle, pull two packs left and right of prison area, go inside, kill all the packs, etc etc
---
Looks fake cause the guy is running sideways then runs forward to run in. The distract actually didn't change the way he was facing at all. The only way this would happen is if he intentionally ran in.
---
A lot of people are arguing for horizontal level progression.
---
awesome ty
---
It follows the patch pattern from the original game. Not a lot one can do about that.
---
Yeah, I remember the time he escorted me from a troll ruins in the Grizzly Hills. Nice role reversal, made me LOL.
---
well unless you already had a wolf from lower levels, like the lvl 18 wolf from sfk with 1.2 atk speed
---
A true inspiration for the children.
---
Sounds great
---
Apparently weapons skill scales better in Classic than Pservers. There’s no fall off to reduction to the damage reduction to glancing blows? I’m not exactly sure
---
I agree, you should have no expectations of fair or honorable fights. That being said, I think the uncertainty is part of the fun. Sometimes you encounter members of the opposite faction that are friendly. Maybe in a minute or an hour they'll try to kill you, but for now you can share an uneasy truce. The emergent gameplay that comes from taking those sorts of risks is part of what makes pvp servers fun.
---
Not possible on the big servers that have mafia nonsense. But huge respect.
---
None of the servers are dead, and I haven’t seen any of the posts you’re talking about claiming they’re dead.
---
Ohh shit, I sold mine because I figured "Who the fuck would need them"
---
When you get enough mana to rez 1 person you should do so then sit back down to drink, so they can drink as well (always another rezer). Don't wait for full mana -&gt; efficiency tip if the day!.
---
Forsaken Mc from under water is also good times.
---
He was gonna be a Knight-Captain, but instead he died right there by that river in Stranglethorn Vale 
---
;(
---
Go ele and you’ll be able to heal and lvl fine. You will struggle before lvl 40 without sufficient mage water and a hard hitting staff
---
We should all ask ourselves, "dId I kIlL c'tHUn bEfOrE?"
---
Isn't warrior fear supposed to break after first damage?  Or did you mean secondary targets?
---
In a way I liken it to speed running a single player game. The people who beat BotW in half an hour don't keep playing in the open world after beating it.
---
I like seeing dings, god forbid a piece of text about someone leveling up in your guild glance your eyeball.
---
As GregariousWords pointed out, there are differences between bluntness and rudeness. Just because you're hybrid (Shammy here) doesn't give you the right to roll Need on all gear pieces for any spec you could potentially use. The most basic loot rule in dungeons is that you only Need gear for the role you are playing - but if you manage to form an agreement with the group that you will instead be needing on Healing gear (and you need the group's approval for this) or if you check what the healer Needs on and ask whether it's OK for you to need on it since he rolled greed, that is all right.
---
Worked for me, he always spawns. You just have to be willing to sit there and watch for hours
---
The poor man's Paladin.
---
You can apply a new scope whenever you want, it does however destroy the old one.
---
I’m really interested in the ele/resto hybrid build for ingame. Any good guides on it?
---
haha you don't seem like too big of a noob! I think you did great, all things considered. Those two horde were admittedly really terrible though lmao.
---
Theres a streamer that i watch that has leveled multiple paladins to max on private servers and every time they'd go down he'd sure as shit be at it again. Now he's playing a warrior in classic... jesus christ. I'm playing a shaman and i can't imagine doing that shit on either of those multiple times.
---
Thank you for your constructive feedback. Clearly I thought I was being helpful. Please show me the way...

Oh really!

I know right? These thread always makes me cringe. Sure, the game is fun and it was popular at launch but if it's dead after 4 months then it wasn't a success IMO.
---
Gotta say, I am always under leveled for each zone. Thats probably because I like to skip some quest in different regions. Went there with lvl 25, not the best idea
---
I recently had an experience of one my friends coming back from their first burning man experience... and how life changing and different being on the playa is, and the playa life style, etc... All I could think about was Shimmering flats/Tanaris

You only melee weave when it's viable, and when it is, like a Patchwork fight, it's a substantial DPS increase.

Hey I got this addon! 
---
Displays notes you wrote on the player's tooltip or when he talks in chat, works on both your faction and enemy faction. It's perfectly working!
---
Bleh. I didn't know it was a streamer server until after I had started there. I just went for the one with the highest pop.
---
You should be stacking Agi, not Str and relying mainly on your auto-attacks and WF procs.
---
Activate windows watermark.
---
I would buy the fuck out of one of these
---
Healers that are serious about raiding in this game are super touchy and entitled and refuse to have to roll against anyone else on their gear, so you'll only get their scraps. I think this comes from the loot council mentality.
---
So just avoid healers that are serious raiders and you'll be fine... sadly at this point very few such healers will be 55+.
---
I switched to ele directly at 40, if you have shield and one hand your armor will easily double and you will take 50% less damage, ever since I got the staff from zul'farrak that gives 21 bonus spell damage and healing, and some boots from quest for additional 8-10 or whatever it is I have really easy time leveling as ele.  
---
Before they even reach me I can just punch them with staff and they die in like 2-3 hits, you save a lot of mana doing this and occasional heal is just fine (also I drop mana spring totem before every engagement).  
---
Oh and use flametoungue totem it's no brainer for ele as the flame tongue damages scales from the bonus spell dagame.  
---
If you want to stick with Enh, try get morgraine mace from SM cathedral last boss, it has 2.7 speed and you might have better life with windfury. I used corpsemaker untill 40 and it was pain as It has 3.7 speed.
---
LOL. Yes. Good hordes are the dead hordes.
---
&gt;There's plenty of assholes on both sides.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
That'll be me today or tomorrow
---
You've yet to prove me wrong though. I've pointed out your inconsistencies and you've been unable to do the same with me. You cannot create reality to be what you want. It's a different type of grind and it's ridiculous to believe otherwise. You can keep saying it isn't a grind but spending hours to improve at something is a grind regardless of what you think. Look up any definition of the word in this context and it all boils down to something akin to "an individual pushing themselves to achieve a goal". I apologize if reality doesn't match what you think and if I've angered you but that's the way she goes. You can come up with your own definition for grind. English is a fluid language after all, but you cannot expect others to change on a dime.
---
I really think your definition for grind which requires an item or improvement to a specific character in game at the end to be completely false. Pro tennis players grind. Starcraft players are on that grind. Someone working hard to pay their bills are on that grind. Your definition is limiting and incorrect.
---
A) You're gonna want to do a mix of assassination and combat talent points. there's a couple of good guides on icy veins. They also go into whether you want to do sword or daggers
---
B) It depends, it's gonna change a lot as you level and what you're encounter is, and what weapons you're using. For instance, right now I have a sword in main hand, so if I have the ability to sneak behind my target, I use a pickpocket/garrote macro, followed by sin strike, then slice and dice, wait for energy, sin strike x 2 , maybe evisc, maybe slice and dice again, depending on remaining hp.
---
C) That's whatever you feel the most comfortable with, try a few combos out, I'm used to hitting 1 the most, so I put sin strike there, since it's you're most used skill, but you're gonna get a lot of skills between stealth and non-stealth, just read the tooltips on all of them and find out what you're gonna be using a lot of
---
D) Yes, in interface, you can uncheck a box, it's something along the lines of "Warning voice", servers are down, so I can't see what the exact one is
---
E) My main macro is 
---

/use garrote

That way, when you sneak behind an enemy, you pickpocket them really fast, then garrote, makes a ton of money that way. You typically have to loot the corpse twice at the end of the encounter. If you're using daggers, you might want to switch from garrote to ambush, up to you.

 Original subthread post: "I agree, this is discrimination. **They should just ban all memes** :)"

Your reply to that post: level 2[servical](https://www.reddit.com/user/servical/)Score hidden · [26 minutes ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6uuug/low_effort_meme_are_you_f_joking_mods/f0vn95l/)

***I agree.*** I get OP's frustration, but I personally don't enjoy memes, no matter the effort OP put on it. **They should just start a** [**/r/classicwowmemes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowmemes/)**/ subreddit** and moderate it how they see fit.   
---
You AGREED with the person who said they should ban all memes, then you suggested we leave and create a new subreddit based on memes. The addition of 'moderate it how they seem fit' is far less relevant than your statement that you don't like memes and that the new subreddit should be for memes specifically (as evidenced by the name you chose for that new subreddit).

Here's a spreadsheet I've been using that shows just how powerful spell damage/shadow damage items are.  This a much better 'bis' gearing guide than some of the sites being passed around on here that dont give you any alternatives.  Many of the random rolled shadow damage items are unrealistic and once you are in the high 50s and 60 you will be mostly target farming dungeon drops with spell damage as they are more consistent.  But by far those stats boost your dps more than anything

You aren’t saying anything substantial, so speak up or shut up, you’re getting boring
---
I'm legitimately confused how everyone says that 45 onwards (or 50 onwards) is just a grind wall. 
---
Having levelled a few characters on private servers, if you know where to look for quests, you're never going to completely run out. I levelled entirely solo on pservers, and was able to quest my way to 60 every time. Now I'm trying to get every dungeon at least once along the way, so surely I shit this one in. 
---
The concensus I've seen is that once you hit 58, there's basically nothing for you to do but grind. That's simply not true in my experience. 
---
**The caveat to all of this** is that I was using addons during levelling like Questie - so if I ever was feeling low on quests, I could zoom out and see everything available to me across the continents. Made it much easier to find plenty of quests in those last few levels.
---
well i wonder how people will feel after they get their pre-bis, epic mount and attunments. i did, i even raided, but i dont have much to do now.
---
I also had no issue. But ya know "the greatest cyber attack of all time shuts down blizzard for an entire weekend" is a nice click bait title.
---
&gt; The fact of the matter is, this information isn’t considered private anywhere else.
---
What does that matter?
---
&gt;  But don’t worry, the bad people wont get you here, you’re safe, you poor thing.
---
You're actually a pretty pathetic person. Legitimately worthy of pity.
---
I liked everything *but* the siege weapons.
---
Early rogue is tough because you're forced to face tank in leather. I would suggest getting the reduced energy for SS and you will use 3-5 SS's then eviscerate. You want sword training early and don't be afraid to buy white weapons because the damage increase is so important at 10 with dual wielding. Things will get better once you get rupture and garrote
---
Thanks for that.
---
 It wasn't on my launcher either. Which is why I'm searching through New for a helpful person like you.
---
Well we're all humans playing this game so claiming that only one faction has a specific mentality is pretty much always stupid
---
Uh... what do you think divine intervention was intended to be used for?
---
Are servers down?
---
Did they eventually make shards Unique (32)?  I could have sworn in Wrath i could only carry 32 and it worked out great because that was how big the soul bag was at the time.
---
yes,but...are you sure Shadow 25% more dmg is THAT much better dmg wise than Holy +50-100 spellpower at lvl 40? cause this sounds huge dmg wise too. With an adittion of superior healings
---
It really depends on the situation.  I'm more likely to deal with it up front than complain after the run starts, such as pointing out which pieces I need and offering to let them have the other ones or something.  Most people are reasonable if you approach it that way.
---
I always thought of it as the 'cooldown' for melee attacks. It's how long between attacks, yeah. Not the most obvious for newer players that lower is faster.
---
Whatever is popular with the kids these days gets flocked to and overplayed
---
Battlegrounds will add a lot more dimension to the game. I can run those all day. If you are on a pvp server the reward is even greater.
---
Got it, I was thinking Warsong Gulch for some reason
---
you can also just LoS the MC...
---
Also if you have a simple macro like this one, #showtooltip is good enough. If you don't specify a spell name after showtooltip it will show the tooltip of the first spell in the macro.
---
Save some typing ;-)
---
Dude people saying no. WHAT? This is leagues better than WW and you normally use WW until 60. Like what??! If I redid my war I would 100% buy Executioners. 
---
Even gatorbite is a top end dmg decrease if you factor in how str affects weapon damage. WW is slower so it’s top end is higher, and it comes with stam.
---
The realms are still high/full because 10.000 players pr server didn't quit during two weeks...
---
Druid is a class not a race, nice try Allitards
---
Meanwhile, feign death....
---
they were harder back in the day, simply because they had to be figured out for the first time
---
I don’t have the bag space so i dont hoard resto gear during levering. Better to be tank, you are the best pre-60 tank in bear form anyways.
---
Dont fuck wave at me.
---
Some ppl sell things way too low (some even under vender price on my server) I’ll never understand why...
---
&gt;why would they not be invested in that?
---
They weren't invested in Classic to begin with. Their initial stance was that there wasn't enough hype. As hype picked up they started it as a side-project to BfA. But the problem with hype is that it eventually goes away and if, by that point, Blizzard has a lot of resources invested in Classic, they'd have been coaxed into a loss. Not to mention by people who still regularly state how much they despise them.
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
I'm a level 29 shaman with a dagger/shield when I usually use rockbiter. I do so much damage I love it! I like the attack speed and the procs.
---
I use flametongue in dungeons to reduce agro but check to see if it does more damage than rockbiter. Sometimes it does.
---
You'll be more proud when you look like a clown but have shadow damage on half your gear at lvl 40!
---
JAB is the kind of person that everyone in the room secretly can’t stand but he offers no clear evidence why you should feel that way other than his attitude. It’s hard to pin down a bad attitude. I feel like some people are experts at crafting a bad attitude just bad enough to where you can’t really pin anything on them when you wonder why you can’t stand them.
---
Thanks! I'm glad I didn't respec last night; It's hard to make good choices when tired, lol
---
They should release AQ tomorrow, why the hell hold it back lol. 
---
Its literally "Keep folks subbed as long as we can". Not "heres a fun release plan". 
---
I'm complaining because this isnt classic. 
---
1. Starting in 1.12
---
2. No BG's at launch 
---
Oops.
---
dude it was tested and the dps difference between attackspeeds was negligible. This means that whether or not it had 100% uptime, during a bossfight, attackspeed didnt matter when this talent is concerned. Keep saying whatever you want, but that's the truth
---
The status reflects the users versus the server capacity. 
---
As Blizz continues to tweak server capacities upwards (remember, we were told that at launch they were only at a fraction of capacity while they tweaked for stability and that they would increase capacity and reduce queues over time) the same number of people will show less impact on population.
---
pvp did not flourish in bc and wrath. everyone just flew around and avoided each other. you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about if you think world pvp existed after vanilla.
---
Yeah, they did so in Wrath.
---
Yeah, and don't get me wrong, I think that Blizzard did the right thing by adding servers during the first few days.  5-8 hr queues isn't healthy at all, but they may have over done it.  Will be interesting to see what p2 looks like when layers are removed, and then interesting to see as interest wains, how hesitant Blizzard is to merge. 
---
Either way, people will be here yelling about how terrible and gamebreaking and unplayable it is :P
---
Are you using incognito mode or something? I'm already getting wowhead links on searches completely unrelated to wow :D
---
Old school Runescape :) taught me how to make many of the gold
---
It's not so bad. If you can predict reflektor, you can make massive use of that. Reflected Siphon life is health neutral, Reflected rank 1 Corruption is free Nightfall procs, any Reflected DoT completly fucks Rogue's Blind for example and against Warlocks and Priests reflecting Curse of Recklessness skews the duel massively.
---
For autoattacks there isn't a difference, however for instant attacks, which are subject to normalization, 2 handers benefit more from AP than 1 handers.
---
Thankfully, a lot of goons have grown up. But we still charge money to join the guild.
---
Ride down enemies, dismount, sprint, distract, stealth, cheap shot. 
---
Works great.
---
When selecting a weapon, go for DPS, except in cases where DPS is similar, in which case select the weapon with the highest top end damage.
---
If you have instant attacks or abilities that go off of weapon damage, compare weapon damage, not DPS.
---
You get less xp.
---
You must be having a rough life and probably dealt with being bullied/pick on/left out a lot, so I apologize.
---
There was in game. I had just logged in and was greeted with the 15:00 countdown timer.
---
I am somewhere in the middle where I would honestly love either.
---
TBC was my favorite version of WoW, so I would love to just play that again.
---
But them doing something both new and old with a Classic+ approach would also be great.
---
I could honestly go either way.
---
You need the battlenet laucher AND an active subscription to see the wow classic download,  its located in the wow tab and there should be a drop down menu above the install button (this drop down menu does NOT show up if there isnt an active subscription to wow)
---
Unability to take a joke ? I pity you :(
---
Honestly have to look at the number after the 1st month since that when some people will have to make the choice to continue subbing or have had enough.
---
Pop on Grob is going strong. Always a ton of players. We had two full groups of Horde competing for spawns at Satyrnaar in Ashenvale last night. I'm always joining people on quests. Tons of Alliance too,  literally tripped over a prowling Night Elf Druid, fought through a group that was fighting furbolgs, saw mounted players riding up and down the road.
---
It's not as crazy as it was at launch but part of that is because everyone has spread out across the world.
---
Shift + Mousewheel up and down are great key binds
---
Roll horde and kill every gnome you see. EZ
---
big gz dude!
---
This looks fake. It’s probably someone trolling with screenshots on their private server.
---
First of all, there are are no other characters on the screen.
---
Also, the chat window only has two comments. One is the guild comment and the other is from this character.
---
I call horse hockey.
---
It gets better once you get WindFury. Basically the same experience, but about 1/5 mobs die almost instantly. One thing I've noticed from leveling is minding the 5 second rule. That is, your mana doesn't regen for 5 seconds after casting a spell. So if you shock... wait 2 seconds... rebuff shield... wait a few seconds... shock/totem/whatever... you just won't regen the entire fight. What I've had success with is bursting all my abilities at once (I usually time it around the beginning of a fight or lighting shield). So many fights I'll only wind up using 1 shock, 1 shield, fire totem, and depending on the fight I may drop a stoneskin. This is going to lead to a lot of just standing there auto attacking, but again, after you get WF (level 30) a significant amount of your damage will be auto-attacks anyway. Practicing this strategy in combination with using more spirit gear has helped reduce my down time significantly.
---
Speaking of stats, I see many guides say to focus on damage based stats. I have almost two complete sets of gear, one damage and one healing. My damage gear is heavy strength and agility. My healing is super heavy spirit with some other stats. I almost never use a large amount of my damage gear because it causes so much downtime for very little damage increase. It just feels like I get so much more out of the spirit than I do the agi and strength. It's basically kill the mob with 1-2 less auto-attacks vs no downtime.
---
Just my experience. I'm no expert. Hope it helps.
---
It might be a lot worse on my server - my post is meant to explain to retail players who are used to respeccing on the fly that there’s no such thing as an offspec in vanilla while leveling.
---
If I convince even one rogue to not throw a hissy fit when a Druid rolls on leather, my job will be done :)
---
Just wondering if my memory is incorrect, but I remember in classic having situations where someone was booted and then they refused to leave the instance , was the teleporting out when kicked something added later? Or am I thinking of heroics or something?
---
Alright...so I knew there was an ah there but I guess I always assumed while both horde/alliance could interface with the NPCs that they were separate ”markets” still.
---
Well, pre-40 there's Shamans on Horde side who also might utilize the same type of gear. And since OP doesn't specify any level at all, he might be talking about lower level dungeons too - in which Cloth has the best healing/caster stats, most leather is pretty crap compared to cloth, so all healers (including Paladins) will be wearing several cloth pieces when healing rather than juicy Agility/stamina leathers or Str/Sta mail items. That broadens the spectrum of rollers quite a bit, since it's often int/spi pieces with occasional damage/healing baked in.
---
These guys are dominating the devilsaurs on our server and have been for weeks. They call themselves the "devilsaur mafia" and will often communicate with their horde counterparts via discord to maintain control over the spawns. They will get their horde friends to kill their competing alliance and vice versa. This isn't fake..
---
I really do not agree with your complaint. Once BGs are out, they will be out FOREVER. You have the rest of time to play it. We only get a brief period where PvP minded people NEED to go out in the open world to seek PvP. This period will never repeat again and you can never go back to revisit it.
---
If BGs mean that much to you, just stop playing until they're released. Your character will still be there. And I don't understand arguments like "I'll lose interest if I quit for a couple of months" because we waited over a decade for Classic. If we can lose interest we would have lost it a long time ago.
---
A big reason i rolled priest over warlock was because of lack of soulwell, and i just didnt want to deal with healthstones without soulwell in a raiding environment.  (Also because Dwarves cant be warlocks)
---
I was even happier i made that decision when i realized that summoning in Classic doesnt make a closet (i started in Wrath).  Holy shit that would have killed me.
---
Ill still be leveling a Warlock alt, but man am i glad i dont have to deal with that stuff lol.  Oh, and my imp getting 2-3 shot at lvl 6.
---
If you are going enhancement and stacking attack power / crit and also have flurry, the phyiscal enhancements are *always* superior. WF having the advantage of no extra threat, and burst potential -- rockbiter has static massive AP for reliable increased dps.  
---
If you are elemental, then flametongue is superior due to its scaling with spell power (fire or generic) and increased critical strike multiplier from elemental devastation.
---
This holds true for both 1 handed and 2 handed. 
---
If you are doing dps and enhance, go windfury with 2h as to not generate extra threat.
---
If you are tanking as either elemental or enhance with a shield, go rockbiter as it generates a static increase in threat regardless of actual dps.
---
If you do not have WF and you are dpsing as enhance, just go rockbiter anyway and use frost shock instead of earth shock.
---
2h as enhance is always better for the increased dps provided by a 2h weapon.  Killing things faster means taking less damage.
---
As elemental, a shield is always preferred as having 2-3k armor makes you very bulky against most classes in pvp and in general enables you to tank as elemental.
---
Rockbiter/flametounge will have more reliable damage especially when you are looking to finish off targets.  Very few situations will occur when you actually will ever use flametongue as enhancement to get around enemies with high armor.

i never liked the boomkin, but ferals were always so cool to me. i tested one out in cata but ended up defaulting to a hunter.

ill prolly make a feral for my alt

Got the tar and feather ready to go!
---
Just wait til you get to SM. Speaking from a holy pally, with mage cleave groups I only want a paladin to tank those. Makes those runs smooth as hell.

I've tanked stratholme in vanilla as a warlock, just because something can be done doesn't mean it's a good idea.

No, this is actually where pie graphs are supposed to be used, when one or more groups is significally lower than the others. 
---
Otherwise, in a bar chart, you'd have the small groups dwarfed by the bigger  data.
---
What irks me is the inconsistency of color and groupings. First druids are orange and then brown? This is madness!
---
They cannot. I made a macro to specifically shift out, use potion and shift right back in though.
---
will keep in mind thanks
---
It is calmer. Used to be even worse.
---
&gt; I'm still using 3 bags that aren't particularly large

I wouldn't advocate for this one as you prolly lose some money when not looting everything. Especially if you are skinning. I believe bags have a really high ROI.

Shit I forgot about that. Legen...wait for it

Even tho str is primary stat?

Rogue is next on my alt hit list, this is very helpful thread, thanks!

During Vanilla I did all endgame content as ele / resto (30 ele / 21 resto) as a healer. I’d typical be in a melee group since I didn’t have mana tide.
---
Our boy's bravery knows no bounds. The hunter pet could have done it in another ten seconds.
---
Was running ST and a rogue asked for dispell. Our healer got super mad and went on like a 10 minute rant about how he always dispells and you don't need to ask for it and how rude the rogue is and he has no respect. Then kicked the rogue. I thoufhtbl it was really childish and left saying I don't have time to find replacements. Healer messaged me and said how easy it was to replace me and put me ignore. Dude has some serious issues.
---
It literally says level 30.
---
This. If anything it's been far, far less disruptive when there's a loot discrepancy. In vanilla shit got heated for even the most minor of upgrades.

If ya need a guild/group send me a whisper :D
---
Which part? Cyber crime in general? The punishment for it? 
---
Cyber attacks are a very serious crime. If someone did what he did to some of my platforms, people would die. It was a malicious attack - not only affecting the company, Blizzard, but also millions of users. The intent here was very clear. The punishments for acts like this are well documented at this point. 
---
Life is pretty simple. Just...don't be a dick.
---
No sorry different drhots
---
I might hav a scuffed opinion on this but.. If it's in the game, everyone can use it, I think it's fair. But then again, I'm coming from games were exploiting was (and still is) key to really be competitive (H1Z1 &amp; Fortnite).
---
I meant in terms of numbers. At one point humans had EMFT and horde still topped the arena rankings though.
---
Thanks for the links!
---
U can even see in the video its not. There is this 1-2 sec delay between fd and trap.
---
It's the lack of opposable thumbs that get them
---
Sadly yeah, paladin are really strong healer but that's all. They were balanced during the BC pre-patch. If you don't want to heal, but want to raid, find yourself a guild where people are laid back and you will be able to go for a ret/sup role. Not pure dps, but like a shamans, healing when necessary, buffing the group, helping out ...
---
you can sit in ur parents basement and cringe all u want but at least guys like u/DukeOfGeek and me ahve kids cause we got laid in our lifetimes ;)
---
and screw us for wanting to raise a new generation of gamers on the classics like wow classic, right?
---
Nah, the difference is minimal, feel free to play as you wish and see what works best for you.

 guild wars 2   looks up   spins the camera back and forth   yes i too tried looking up my characters skirt

I'm sure there are addons out there, but I don't know of any because I learned to manage this on my own.  Turn your camera so you can see the sheep and know if it breaks early.  Develop a timer in your head so you can re-sheep as necessary.  Situational awareness is plenty to handle this.  
---
One thing that can help your party is if you macro your polymorph to announce and mark who you are sheeping.

---
Also gear regularly stated for specific specializations. Gear in vanilla was cray cray. There is a suffix "of the" for literally every stat combo. Tell me, what spec wants a 2h sword with Agi and Spirit? None yet it's in the game.

the amount of healing is huge when you start factoring in using down rank heals.

Welcome to my KoS list! Zeroagent, undead rogue. Laughing Skull Clan. Sweet shirts though!
---
ive heard theres a blacklist addon that automatically syncs people added and reasons in your guild and group with other players
---
everyone should download so we can completely lock out douchebag players of the entire game society
---
If this was one guild i would have done that.  I wouldn't punish the other 3 for one random persons douchebagery.
---
Just do what me and my friends do, The dude who levels says grats and we say Ding multiple times, gets the guild nice and annoyed.
---
Best comment ever. Laughed out loud here at work
---
As Alliance on Benediction, I have the opposite experience. Get tanked all the time in hillsbrad/arathi. And let’s not forget the constant raid group you guys always have going in the SM instance room
---
If you join a group to run a dungeon, it should be for the whole dungeon (or w/e was agreed upon in the beginning, if not full clear). 
---
Anyone who leaves after their boss doesn't drop the loot they want is an ass.
---
Glad to have been useful at work today.
---
its not just 25% more damage which is big, its also a 15% phys dmg reduction. I swapped to disc/holy and my ttk on mobs was so slow it was unbearable. My questing is netting the same if not more then dungeon grinding which imo gets boring and i'll have to run a lot more for gear, so i'm questing until around 55 which will be tonight.  Only 15 on seconds spirit tap...only? I jump up to 500 spirit my regen is amazing for 15 seconds, I take 2-3 mobs at once so that 15 seconds becomes 25-40 seconds depending on kill timing. once I'm comfortable hop off sf, pop renew on myself and then i go. Little downtime to drink, decent ttk. If I need to run a dungeon I don't have to change specs. disc/holy is good with a partner but solo go shadow without a doubt.
---
Reminder that the geniuses at blizzard actually thought that 5 PVP servers would be sufficient for the entire western hemisphere.
---
To help with down time I am cast two lightning bolts and then a shock to start. That usually takes off a good portion of the mobs health. After that I melee the rest. That lets your mp start regening during the fight. I also level up first aid and if I need a heal use a bandage rather than use a heal and interrupt the mp regen. Try to time rockbiter buffing and lightning shield to be during the time you cast spells. I hear rockbiter is the optimal weapon buff. Either before the start or during the battle after the initial casts. That way it doesn't interupt your mana regen. I have not done any testing of it that would be considered factual, it feels like more damage then the other weapon buffs to me. Totems help but I tend to not use them unless I know I can get multiple mobs over. I feel like they can be a liability with mob respawn at times and bringing over extra mobs I am not wanting to deal with. 
---
Be careful in groups with earth shock since it generates extra agro and unless you are the tank you don't want the mob on you.
---
When you get windfurry you definitely want to give a 2hand a try. When it procs and crits both hits the damage is really nice. I level with a 2 hand but especially if you are going to tank/off tank 1hand and shield work well. I saw a video saying go 2handed on mobs below your level and 1hand and shield for at level or above. I don't do that but that is supposed to be optimal.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Im doing a combo.  But I got a huge chunk of booty bay quests left. Did some dustwallow marsh, arathi, and finished all the Alterac mtn stuff.
---
Grow up.
---
i know that feeling, classic is basically a no-reroll zone. unless your ready for another slow grind.
---
if ur over like lvl 30 it can seem like an impossible task to reroll. but the one thing i will say
---
if you dont like your class, reroll (keep in mind warrior isnt that much better vs mages or any ranged class) because you dont want to be 50+ bored out of your mind.

You’ll have to ask the group your with. Just be upfront and nice about it and most people will just be glad they have a healer.

What a stupid logic, just because you don't enjoy watching (not even playing) Classic means it's boring? I feel like this thread is on r/wow and not on r/classicwow when I see responses like yours. This thread is full of them by the way.

You have good arguments. Take my upvote.

You can disable error speech without turning off the rest of the character sound effects/dialog.

Tl;dr barely won against low lvl so op corpseganked the low lvl untill he quit the game
---
Seems sexist
---
57 vs 60 is not a big deal. I have absolutely no idea why you have such a problem with me.
---
The reason for the complaint is the imbalance that clearly exists. Next time I'll make sure I don't round up from 57 to 60. Yikes!

Yeah totally agree, rogues are the real baddies

I kept a stockpile of these on my guy in retail and had it active constantly. Was fun being extra large all the time.

I thought they removed functionality for this? It still works?
---
How will you verify the player is a female and not just a man playing a female character?
---
&gt;I am not making any money at this because the market is flooded with hide and leather  
---
It's same with all professions right now. Too many people are skinning/gathering herbs/mining. And not enough money on players to spend extra on AH.  
---
I would recommend dropping both and pick up tailoring/enchaining.  
---
It won't bring you money, but at least it would give you some nice gear and buffs.
---
Not really sure what kind of thoughts you are asking for. Are you asking permission?
---
Undercutting by 1c is the standard.

Enh shaman.

Game feels ruined for me. Didn't think I'd be playing a meme spec. Haven't been in a bad group in past 25 hours of playtime. And holy fuck white hitting and praying for wind fury procs feels like I'm playing runescape.
---
Weird, I got the same feeling as a horde on Flamelash and there hasn't been a time I've been on that boat that a priest did not try to mind control me off the boat.
---
Yeah, saying "I didn't do it intentionally!" while you're sitting in the same spot for two hours is...well, bullshit.
---
Respectfully disagree with the first part.
---
The part about colors though... riot-worthy.
---
That would do it on either or.  So if alt isn't held it will hold true regardless of form.  Also if I'm not in cat form, regardless of alt being held it would hold as true.
---
I don't get it.. They absorbed it. It's a bubble. It absorbs damage. If your crit was 300dmg and the bubble was for 1,000dmg.. they will absorb all of it.
---
Dude Youtube just recommended your video for me yesterday!  
---
Awesome video, I liked ;)
---
I did the research for you. According to [this](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/40107-demo-shout-theorycraft/). NPC monsters rely on AP a lot more for dps than players do. Apparently the formula is:
---
Damage = BaseDamage * (0.7 + 0.3*AP/BaseAP). NPCs have 290 AP which you can reduce to zero by using both talented demo + screech since they stack and would reduce boss dmg by 30%. Also a quick google would have told you that screech has no [CD](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=24423/screech).
---
&gt;Don't drop the soap, snowflake.
---
You're so edgy xDDDD
---
&gt;Nobody is annoyed because you think their joke is unfunny. People get annoyed because you are trying to censor what people can and cannot say.
---
It's ironic you mention comprehension when you don't understand what "censor" means. We criticized the joke for being shitty, as rape jokes usually are. 
---
&gt;If you don't like the joke, that's fine. Trying to shame people into silence because you think a drop the soap joke is off color is the issue.
---
See first response

&gt;You can't even comprehend the conversation here, have a good one man. Stay in school.
---
Lol... You aren't equipped to have this conversation. Take care, sport.

you're not wrong
---
Duskwood worgen is popular if you're alliance.  You're close to being able to do the Arathi farms at that level.
---
Well he didn't say that but people here seem to completely ignore the and in his comment
---
Mad props for doing something fun and cool over what is mechanically "the best".
---
I never have the mana problem. All I need is WF, lightning shield and storm strike for a couple kills before I need to drink
---
In essence a warlock is worse than a mage but a warlock adds more utility with that stuff.
---
How accurate are these because [Kurinnaxx is apparently 2+:1 Horde;Alliance.](http://classicrealminfo.com:5001/Chart/Kurinnaxx)
---
its more like "sounds like you think those numbers are bigger than that number" and looks liek im wrong x) cause everyone is telling shadow dps&gt; holy spirit boosted dps.  So,probably im just a noob =p  And will continue leveling as shadow :)
---
I’m really hoping for faction transfers too, at least for realms with a faction imbalance
---
Considering the replies that OP is sending me (and then deleting so I can't reply), that's probably exactly right.

---
Your right about the druid tank attitude. Either way, I think you will be fine. I do realize not having rez can be a bitch sometimes. That's just the way she goes. (Ray from Trailer Park Boys Voice)
---
Maybe I’m looking at it with rose-tinted glasses, I got 4 toons to 60 and 1 to 70 (shaman, Druid, hunter, paladin), all classes that “soak up gear” before I quit late 2007.  I really do think this retail neutering of hybrids, which no longer seem to exist (only one role at a time) plays a big role in people’s complaints.
---
the starting zones are getting emptier but the 10-20 and 20-30 zones are pretty lively now. just seems that anyone who has started a character is progressing pretty well now. we'll see how many people end up making alts
---
What level do you get it?.
---
you should do the dungeons in your level range at least once to complete all the quests. The gear from these dungeons will also make questing easier / quicker.
---
Meanwhile first week people in barrens chat in kurinnax were paying money to be /spit on.

Did my sarcastic mention of DNA testing not convey the tongue-in-cheek humor I was going for? I also clearly mention that your **statement** in itself is correct, but that voice gives a fairly good estimate (fairly good, as in accurate most of the time, but not in all cases). Did you just skim my reply and take offense? Your phrasing indicates that is is so, but no offense was intended.
---
AGI should be your primary stat for Enhance

Especially considering how many realms opened on or after launch day
---
how much of this UI is default and how much of this did you have to customize?  I've grown to like my addons and set up but this looks REALLY nice

I can assure it does not, having a lvl 60 hunter myself.

Or this whole thing is bait to get girls to send pics of their vjays as “verification”.

1 of 3 isn't bad at all . If I pull 3 mobs iit's very likely ones getting a stun then I can focus on the other 2. If I have 4 mobs 2 will get vamp embrace. then a fear for all 4, I try to keep ve up on everything I kill. It's super easy.
---
Personally I stopped as well. I rushed my Orc Shaman and got a hunter to 30 as well. 
---
I was already on the way out in the first week but pushed on because at 60 I thought I'd get that Linear Progression sense of accomplishment from progressing. But the level of difficulty is way below what "I remembered" so everything felt super devalued.
---
Aren't you supposed to gear agility??
---
You can literally get PW:S then sit macro through dungeons taking 0 damage
---
Woah that’s a pretty generalizing statement there
---
It'll be worth more when more people start raiding.
---
I was thinking of starting a male guild, but realized we wouldnt have any Preists. 😏
---
And you dont get that same adventure on retail because you can boost a character to 110. Spam dungeons with people already doing the same thing. You can quest anywhere because everything scales to your level. 
---
Part of the fun/nostalgia people get from classic is the journey from 1-60. So many different scenarios play out for people and it’s the world building aspect that I think people love the most.
---
/upvote
---
- Not using much spells to conserve mana. My younger self would scream at me why I won't spam arcane shot on cd.
---
- Using (or even actively seeking) spirit gear for leveling. I didn't grasp the concept of conserving mana back then. I'd rather waste money &amp; time drinking than take 3 seconds longer for a kill with the next one already lined up.
---
- Playing BM. I never liked the beast fantasy aspect of hunters, and always imagined them as a lone ranger/tracking kind of guy. In order to accomplish both of the above points and be as efficient as possible, BM is just king by a mile. (btw retail is nailing the hunter class fantasy imo. Having the "lone wolf" talent and a dedicated melee spec where you fight shoulder to shoulder with your pet is just amazing. I like my pet 100% more when I play SV)

WC3 Reforged the real Warcraft Classic.

Best believe I run inside and shadowmeld somewhere inconspicuous every time. I've never ridden it without there being at least 2x the number of horde as alliance so it just seems like the right move
---
Tank in arms, prot in raids at 60
---
Thank you :D
---
So i want to farm the Recipe of the Deviat-Supreme, but i just dont know where a good farm spot is. Has someone a good farm spot and is willing to share it with me?
---
at this point (im on a newer server), pretty much the only way i can sell something is to really undercut so the other people can buy my stuff and relist. it doesnt sell at their price at all so i guess they overprice it.
---
Then you’re in a shitty guild.
---
nah I often make things on the fly. It's surprising how many things don't need an anvil or alternatively the places you can find an anvil while leveling. Keeping it with me has been super useful.
---
Hecking bamboozled.
---
I’m fully behind this and encourage you to put in an effort to start the guild. You’d be the first from what I know. You’ll get a lot of hate and entertaining reactions, but you’ll be popular especially among solo females (married women wouldn’t bother because most would be playing with their spouses I’m guessing).
---
Of course they do. The only thing that informs these decisions is you. Therefore the decisions you make are reflective of you. It isnt that hard bud.
---
If you intend to tank full-time later on, I wouldn't suggest switching to prot until the mid 50s or so. By then you will find that dungeons are getting harder and the extra threat and mitigation from being prot is worthwhile. Up until that point, it's probably better to stay as arms since you can still tank reasonably well and you can solo level effectively too.
---
Prot can solo fine, but it's slow.
---
It's possible that the guild I was in simply sucked. I joined late so I was broke compared to other players and couldn't get any gear I wanted, and when I attempted to bank points, I got bullied into spending them on tiny upgrades that the more experienced raiders already had.
---
Either Energy Reborn or SimpleEnergyBar.  I'm not at my computer right now but those are the two that Twitch says I have installed.
---
Crits proc Flurry my dude
---
I'm not offended. Not by you, anyway. By the OP perhaps.
---
You aren't even equipped to buy your own car insurance. Much less have a discussion where you clearly have been brainwashes by your liberal arts degree or some shit like that.
---
Yea thats not a look you want.  Reputation is a thing with old school MMO's.  You cant just be a toxic asshole whenever you feel like it with no repercussions.  It will catch up to you at some point.
---
I did that, uncontested for 9 hours.
---
Could be a new bug with layers.
---
What is nested macro? And look I found multiple versions for retail sovit must be possible.
---
39 with 90g as a warrior. havent bought any upgrades to any skill except sunder, only bought WW after level 28, many quests and SM runs
---
I had an alliance player help me with a quest the other day. It was really nice of them to do! :)
---
i see,i see, ty :O
---
Yeah the mods on this sub are stupid with their meme policy. I bet this is some jobless pos who enjoys having power over others that bans all of these memes.
---
As a healer with my luck I'll get the random people who body pull and yell at me when I can't save them (looking at you hunters and pets). I'll end up doing a couple full runs soon. I'll hit 55 tonight and thats when my brd runs will start happening.
---
Well it's a pvp server so pvp takes priority over pve :)

Don't come here with your new and original ideas. We don't like change around these parts. #nochanges
---
Critical hits with 'most' attacks.
---
Also, where's the combat log to show the damage he's absorbing?
---
&gt;  I know they can do 5 man content fine but most seem to prefer warriors.
---
You can tank a good 80% of everything. There are only a few fights where we are at a severe disadvantage and would be a liability to the raid, first phase of Thaddius comes to mind with all the crushing blows.
---
But hell as long as you have better than average gear, you should be able to tank Kel'thuzad himself when he finally arrives! You just need slightly different tactics for it with the rest of the group, for instance when you get MC's it would usually be OK for a war since its a sort of polymorph effect, but you are immune to it as Bear, so its just straight up MC and it can ruin everything, so others need to be ready with different CC's to sort it.
---
All in all MOST fights can be done with a bear, just in different ways to a warrior team.
---
Oh is THAT what it is, I was sure it was just iOS being an absolute worthless piece of shit.
---
 cooking is great for that. Even if you're making stuff that's grey it vendors for more than the raw materials. It's only a little bit, but it definitely adds up
---
Yesterday, two Horde and I smoked two alliance as the ship departed Booty Bay. We were pleasantly surprised when they autorezzed after the load screen, so we killed them again.
---
I don't get this - hunter PvP is the most active and involved thing in the entire game. You're the only one that can effectively hunt down and solo rogues, you're the only class that needs to balance a deadzone and be constantly moving, you've got a whole pet to manage, and a toolbox of useful spells larger than any other class. 
---
Sure, raiding as hunter is boring. But who raids for excitement anyways?
---
Like I said, that hasn’t been my experience. People who played WoW much more recently than me seem to think offspec while leveling is a thing, and this post is a friendly reminder that it’s not.
---
You think this is bad? In FXIV I've seen a guy constantly dismiss a significant damage buff a healer was giving him in a boss fight, think Blessing of Might but stronger but only for 30 seconds every few minutes. It's a major part of the healers kit and how they contribute to PvE so to see the buff appear on him then suddenly vanish was weird.
---
Eventually the healer asked what was up, DPS said to stop buffing him because he wanted to play "his way" and "played for challenge". He even said the healer was toxic for trying to make him minmax. In group content I must remind you. 
---
It gets better, the DPS then explained he was so sick of people buffing him he had keybound macros to cancel that and other significant buffs other classes gave. I don't think he was joking.
---
So... servers that were frequently incapable of maintaining stable playing environments, delivering promised content and were under perpetual threat of being shutdown were immensely popular... but the real thing is not going to be?  Or we cant derive any information from private servers?  You know who was kicking and screaming for WoW classic?  People on the private servers.
---
Absolutely not. 
---
This sounds just like Twitter visit where anyone can make a claim and everyone will believe it with zero evidence. Unless you only sync with people you can 100% trust then it can and will be heavily abused.
---
This is dope! Please keep making these.
---
Aye. Find a guild. The one I've been leveling with has only one Druid even 50+ and it's me. 
---
I think the stigma about Druids will die out when people realize MC/Ony is easy. Not sure about BWL/Naxx for druids though.
---
Agreed, i try to stay positive and keep my mood generally happy whenever i'm streaming.  I feel like good vibes resonate.  We play games to get away from the shit of everyday, so why bring it online.
---
And a lot of talent. You forgot the most important bit.
---
Level to 50!
---
Good one, Gramps.

On a serious note, lmk when you have anything of substance to add, Boomer McGee
---
I’m 56. I’ve been running pretty much just BRD 52-56, as a healer and a tank. (Paladin, sort of dual-specced.)
---
I haven’t had huge issues, but most of my healing has been with a tank I know and just DPS pugs. Tanking I haven’t had much issues.
---
Good bot
---
"People like different things" yet the dude try to tell us what we liked. There is absolutely nothing in the above statement that shoes "he owned it"

---
Cooking and first aid are mandatory for reducing downtime.  Don’t be afraid to switch zones so you can always be flying through green quests/green mobs.
---
It is also totally ok to group up for questing.
---
You should tell other people on your server about this--your server had a server subreddit or discord?
---
What mobs we talking? :) Just hit 51
---
Yea that's why simply clearing content doesn't make you a top guild anymore it's not a difficult concept.
---
Yeah, I've seen for blue gear on the AH its so expensive that nobody buys it.
---
Phase 3 isnt coming out for another 5 months. The few dozen people that want to twink certainly aren't doing it now. There is no excuse to put your Barbaric Bracers or Burning War Axe up at the same price of your average level 30's life savings, people.
---
Dots / channeled spells can't crit.
---
Shhhh, don’t ruin it for us who knows the value of certain items come raid time for the majority of the server 😆
---
That was tough to read. People only care about social justice things? He is anon? Who turns a blind eye to murder??  Lol wtf are you on about? Might be time for an, internet break my dude
---
Didn't know that, thanks. Always good to improve your second langage: )
---
&gt;cision has always plagued me i
---
I'm on the flip side of this.  When I hit 60 I want to create more characters for the professions.  I have a Pally that's a blacksmith/miner, next will be a priest for my cloth/enchanter, then comes my rogue or engineering/leatherworking, then a druid for the other leatherworking and skinning.  And so on.  For some reason I really like farming mats in this game.  And I ALWAYS loved farming in Vanilla.
---
At level 25 trying to kill lvl 30 mobs is also bad for you
---
If it's a core group of raiders, then the lowest geared should have the DKP to get the upgrades they want. That's the beauty of the system. Everyone has a pretty equal shot at gear.  
---
It's not perfect, since some items are more contested than other, but it still gives everyone a fair shot. You don't have to deal with the drama that comes with handing out loot to someone and making everyone else feel bad, you let the players themselves decide how they want to spend the points they earn.  
---
It makes every raid feel worthwhile, since you earn points, even if you didn't earn loot.
---
True. with 40 people in one group there's quite a big chance that a couple of them have shit computers.
---
I remember disconnecting as 1 of 4 mages on Majordomo when it was crucial that we kept the healer adds polymorphed through the fight, and my computer was so bad it couldn't handle logging in next to 39 other people. took too long to load everything so I kept disconnecting and we had to end the raid there for the night lol.
---
Even if so, level 40 is not even half the xp needed from 1-60.  Pretty sure level 46 is the halfway mark, so even if you rush to 40, you still have plenty of time to enjoy the journey.
---
Damage over time effects don't crit.
---
Because guilds spam invites to anyone not in a guild.  This person probably just accepted a rando invite and when they realized guild chat was annoying they left.
---
I did they exact same thing.
---
Sulfuras
---
I came in during MC farm to fill out the BWL group in vanilla, our Druid class lead was 6/8 stormrage already and basically told me if I didn’t want something to refuse it as to not waste DKP, I had them DE just about all of the MC drops I could have taken in order to have enough to cash in in BWL. Ended up 5/8 real fucking quick as a result
---
It's a talent in marksmanship.
---
Isn't that a skill obtained via talents in the Marksmanship tree? You're going to have to do that.
---
not for me
---
:crab:
---
I would say that I'm playing pretty casually and I'm only level 28. I would guess the majority of players are around my level.
---
You'll always be very useful, but it will never be super obvious like a damage dealer. Paladin buffs are incredibly strong for all classes but not flashy, so make sure you keep them up. If you notice monsters run in a dungeon, prioritize judging them with the anti-fleeing judgment. Stun things that run to the healer and BOP them.
---
That's why people use bank alts, they can just mail it and post whenever.
---
But yeah unless its double vendor I just get rid of it
---
lol
---
level 1 is from the talent tree.
---
Yeah the grind through 50-60 is definitely a very tough leveling grind, but I really don't understand why I see people act like it's a year long gauntlet of torture.
---
I never really found myself running out of quests or getting fatigue because the hype of hitting 60 gets stronger as u go imo.
---
Ya I'd definitely be upset
---
I'm a resto shaman, and half my pre-raid BiS is cloth. You're just going to have to deal with that fact. It's how the game is itemized.
---
Yawn, now you're boring me.
---
Isnt aimed shot an ability from the talenttree?
---
FeelsBadMan I got my name reserved on all but two EU servers...
---
it's a pvp server man and you're in a contested zone. the guards being there don't make you immune to pvp
---
Sorry, you're an asshole. Don't play on a PVP server if you're going to camp someone for spitting.
---
To offer a counterpoint, for most leveling healers dps IS their mainspec, so to argue they shouldn’t roll on dps loot is to argue they don’t deserve gear for their mainspec too. You will get fewer healers while leveling if you insist on this
---
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
---
You are a champion. Ill try it out when I get a chance.
---
How is leveling not wasting time?
---
oh he knows me, he said my name countless of times in twitch as i ganked him
---
Everything fits this definition.
---
I don't think blizzard CAN crit even :/
---
Have you taken the talent?
---
Sunk Cost Fallacy is real. It keeps people in failing marriages, dead-end jobs, tanking stock markets and (in conjunction with the Gambler’s Fallacy) casinos stacked against them until they’ve lost far more than they could ever hope to get back.
---
and what do you do when the main tank can't raid because of her monthly condition?
---
Oh my phone cut the extra text. RIP.

He views DKP as being better for guilds who constantly rotate members and Loot Council for set progression groups.

Ah yes my daily gnoll tent post

---
&gt; Turns out, 2 out of 2 rogues are just jerks.
---
I think I've seen more than 3 here the last week
---
It depends on the level, really. Tankadins shine in 5 mans late game. Before that, all your best tanking abilities require talents, consecration costs too much mana, spell power gear is non-existent, and there's no point putting spikes on a shield you'll outlevel in a day.
---
BUT THE REFERENCE CLIENT
---
Awesome, thank you. It's really hard for me to understand raid progression of classic/vanilla. I didn't start raiding til TBC which seemed much more straight-forward.
---
It's alarming seeing opinions of folks on reddit ranging from "bear tanks are unusable in top raids" to "we know so much about classic raids that anything will be viable eventually".
---
&gt; This guy was telling everyone who would listen Classic raids were hard, private servers undertuned etc etc.
---
They are undertuned. Depends what you are refering to though, raids? Not really, they're easier in Classic. Obviously. Leveling? Leveling is harder, the requirements and pre-reqs for quests are there, which half of them dont work in priv servers. Then the mobs act correctly, they use their spells. Half the mobs on priv servers dont have spells or correctly use them. Class mechanics arent broken like on priv servers, pvp is a joke there.
---
It actually was 130k concurrent players. Warmane's servers alone have about 20k people online right now and they've had numbers like that for years, *and* this is after the release of Classic. In fact, they probably used to have another 5-10k more people than that on average on their BC server which is mostly dead now.
---
Hopefully hes extradited to the US and they slap some RICO charges on him.
---
Thank you so much! I’m thinking of starting a priest for dungeons and then another class for more solo stuff
---
I camp people.
---
To piggyback off this comment, I’ve found buffwatch supremely useful for managing my blessings, keeping those 5 minute buffs up is a nightmare without it, and your group will notice the difference.
---
Warlock only: quest from one of the warlock trainers in SW to get some ingredients from Duskwood and Wetlands, then give the resulting brew to a SW noble. Anyone can do this part, but warlocks get a follow up that rewards the hat.
---
Pure evil muahahaha
---
Being limited by your Mana as a means of generating threat and not having a hard taunt makes pallies unreliable. Not bad, but there are some bosses or monsters that will completely dump threat and a pally has no way of undoing that.

---
Depends on how you play, really. I've been playing nonstop but haven't even hit 50 yet. The only purpose of phase 1 is to reach 60 so why rush it? I dick around, I pvp, and I know there's level 40 and 50 content still coming out in later phases so I'm alternating between characters, leveling a few alts up to 40ish while I focus on my main. Taking it all slow, like the first time.

"Said he didn't want to be streamed" LOL Biggest pile of dog shit I've heard.
---
Honestly I feel like outlaw was wayyy more fun than combat. After the grappling hook nerf I changed mains though.
---
I have a feeling it's causes by the spell batching. The "batching" in this is not like in real vanilla.
---
You do realize Alliance have 2 flight points in Feralas, right? I wouldn't call it a primarily Horde zone by any means.
---
You don't shoot things while leveling?
---
ahh fair enough, whatever works works. I've mostly lvled my engineering in bursts. Having 4 totems + an offspec set of gear in my bags is already too much, so I figured keeping profession stuff in the bank is a small way to help open up more space.
---
The Silithid in Un'Goro have a 30min disease that makes you take 40% more physical damage, in a zone with only melee mobs.
---
I got this disease and decided to just kill myself to get rid of it.
---
pretty sure it goes both ways as ive had that happen many times to me but w/e
---
While you can do that, my experience has definitely not been that the group would stop damaging a mob to allow you to get the last hit, and maybe I'm just bad but I can definitely not snipe out the mob from under the rest of the group,

I have it set to 10 and stuff is still foggy within what I would consider a reasonable view distance. Most of the time it's not too bad, but when you're flying it's especially noticeable. There are certain zones that it looks fine in and others that it just looks like garbage. 
---
For instance... Walking up to IF the whole mountain kind of gets bigger or 'melts' into view when walking up to it instead of the whole mountain just being visible from the start. It really takes away from the experience of the world seeing this.
---
Grtz
---
So fill groups with people who have not done it. Got it.
---
I'd love to see footage of this in action then as there are certain packs which are guaranteed to hit you (e.g. the one at beginning of the large hallway). A bubble can take a few hits but at rank 7 it will break before you get to the ledge (assuming you kill the third pack before the wallskip only, again only in my experience)
---
Sure but let's learn from the game's mistakes as we now know where continuing to head down that path leads us.
---
This will be all over CNN and FoxNews for the next month.
---
Yeah i have been able to start instances 2 to 3 levels below as a healer.  I started doing ulda at 40 as a full resto shaman.  It allows me to level fast enough without having to respec.  Occasionally groups are scared to bring me but eventually get desperate and it goes well.
---
Yep, noticed this and sometimes wonder if people have been exploiting this to mess with others. To many times have had someone get close to me and suddenly all the stuff they agroed is attacking me
---
“Psychotic leaves the raid.”
---
Nope, Not why I came back to play Classic.
---
Lol right? I got my warlock to 18 last night and felt good about myself
---
Sheeping people as a mage heals them. My first character in WoW was an undead mage and if I came across any heavily damaged Alliance, I'd sheep them then walk away. This let them get healed up and continue on their way to leveling and questing.
---
Shadowmeld is so underrated
---
My policy is don't help/hinder opposite faction unless they are forsaken rogues.  Also I like to stand just out of sight and heal alliance who are getting ambushed.
---
You can fish wreckages and such for better loot, and also you can cook the fish to make passable food. Vendor price is low key really high for consumables, so underpriced food will actually sell on the AH. Then, there's also deviates, which can sell for quite a bit; and if you have the recipe and can make deviate delights yourself you can make plenty of money.
---
But at 60, it's all about the alchemy mats like stonescale eels and things like nightfin soup for raid consumables.
---
You won't when he comes alive and kills you D:
---
I immediatelly assumed he meant actually target, in order for emotes and stuff as its a pretty meme position. But yeah, youre obviously right if its for actual spells
---
Thats a lie. I was helping a tauren warrior do his, at the same time i was doing mine. I was tanking for him, and right as big willie was called in, he unleashed a heroic strike execute combo on me.  And called in a couple lvl 33-35 warriors of the horde to corpse camp me. But more alliance warriors showed up and we drove them out. 
---
Everytime they tried to enage us, they all died while we only would lose 1. Horde have no honor on that island
---
There are better ways. I can fake a female voice in under a minute. No, we need more proof... of another nature.
---
I think the ultimate take-away here is communicate. If you bring in any new people, you should at least consider them for something, as they're putting in time to help you complete the raid. Ultimately what that is will depend on the raid, but compensate them for their time, and determine ahead of time with the core raiders what that will be.
---
We get out of this community what we put into it; paying it forward will come back around.
---
That's what friends lists are for!
---
A really good Hunter is arguably one of the most useful classes you can have in a dungeon. At their best they can kite things near indefinitely and save wipes.
---
The problem is at their worst they're class most liable to CAUSE wipes...
---
I know, I finished the content up to AQ40 back in the days. But since its timegated again and split into phases, it already feels artificially drawn out and will probably go on a alternating cycle with major retail patches.
---
I know the numbers, not interested in that -
---
Those of you who switched to Elemental after 40, do you find it more or less *fun* than enhance?
---
How is getting ganked while wearing cloth?
---
I’m about to hit 40 and am planning to switch, so I’m curious about these things.
---
Pretty sure it's called NuEnergy
---
That doesn't matter. Some quests cannot be complete while in a raid (basically every LBRS one), which is basically what OP was asking.
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure Undead is the most common race in Horde. Probably not majority but definitely plurality
---
&gt; Will be interesting to see how long they wait to release phase 2. I mean every phase is going to be important, but phase 2 is probably the most game changing.
---
What does phase 2 bring?
---
2.6 speed?  Is that good for anyone?
---
Best face you can have on an undead
---
Hey, everybody can draw. I mean, I dont think im good, but I dont really care. Just try and have fun.
---
There are still some abilities that greatly benefit from slow weapons and some from fast ones.
---
Good example is Paladins SoC. You want the weapon as slow as possible to a higher chance of proc/attack and also making better use of the stacking nature of retribution talents and buffs. 
---
While I'm by no means a shaman expert I've also heard that windfury benefits slower weapons more then faster ones. 
---
For fast as possible are rogue off hands a good example for applying a specific poison. Say if you want the mob to be slowed or receive reduced healing.
---
You understand. When I lost the roll of blue int leather gloves to a hunter, I wasn't too happy.
---
They don't give any specific number for obvious reasons. I'm with Blizz on this one, though. Multiple hours a day of griefing low level players is way over the line. Dude should get a life.
---
As long as it's set up correctly, it will automatically find the poison in your bag.
---
My plans for Friday night have changed.
---
Weapon have a speed, a dps and resulting of these two the actual damage you get with every arrow.
---
If it was just that then the speed wouldn't be important but you have some abilities such as aimed shot and multishot that are based not on the dps (damage per second) but the actual damage of the weapon so if you have a 50 dps bow with a 1sec speed your aimed shot (rank1) would hit for 50+70=120, if you have a bow with the same dps (50) but a 3sec speed, the damage of aimed shot would be 150+70=220, see the damage gain here?
---
On top of this, hunter can do what is named melee weaving to maximize their damage, this is only doable with slow weapon.
---
I wish I could ask old me how I felt about warhammer online 3 weeks then 3 months after release. That qas a new game, so not the same, butbit would be such a difference
---
Isn’t the inevitable future just the current retail content? How will they keep it fresh? Will they add classic expansions? I’m loving it, but is there a long term plan?
---
What a loser
---
Grind wall?
---
Such is the life of a volunteer janitor
---
Thank you :)
---
nah viewership is higher look up statistic for esports viewings lol, also look at worlds last year compared to the first couple years :&gt; theres stats on the league reddit
---
Can’t trust blizzard to get even the basics right
---
Hell yeah fish on bro
---
Nothing wrong with using this to reset the instance, assuming you’re getting teleported back to the start. 
---
The bans are from resetting a boss repeatedly and killing the same boss over and over without having to clear trash or run back to the boss.
---
Transmogs was the single worst thing they put in the game. I don't have a point to raid in retail I can put on whatever gear I farm.
---
Yup, your last meaningful, joy-inducing milestone birthday was four years ago (unless you plan on running for President).  Everything from here on out just becomes increasingly depressing.  Before long, you will start using phrases like "X is the new Y" (plug in arbitrary ages for "X" and "Y") with a phony, rictus grin on your face.
---
God I fucking hate redditors like you. You literally have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Mind flay is bad before 44; with rank 4 and shadowform it's far better dps than wanding. It's definitely not "closer to 15%" than 40%... You've got shadowform/darkness for a flat 25%, and SW gets significantly better once you actually start talking about using mind flay.
---
It might be less efficient to cast PW:S, but I usually used it 3/4 of pulls and didn't have any mana issues with MB/SW:P/PW:S/MFx3.
---
yeah calling that pvp :D yeah its pvp on its way for sure xd
---
Solo PvE = Growl + Bite
---
Group PvP = Claw + Bite
---
 Im completely new to WoW, classic is my first experience and needless to say im addicted. I went against what my friends said to do and put my early money into tailoring, and its been quite profitable and ive even gotten 300 tailoring. With that being said I have no idea what patterns I should be buying in order to maybe make some profitable cloth items. Mostly everything I see on AH is green cloth patterns with maybe a few blues that are crazily over priced. I dont know the gear/sets so ive just bought a few I thought might be able to sell (Frostweave tunic, frostweave gloves, mooncloth bag etc.) Wondering if any of you vets might be able to clarify which ones might be profitable or must grabs for a 300 tailro
---
&gt; What the fuck are you learning in 6th grade
---
How to properly use computers? Every damn job these days basically requires the use of computers.
---
I have to say all the good vibes of the start of classic are quickly evaporating.
---
I added 5 people to my ignore list last night in 2.5 ZF runs.
---
1. On first run, a Mage who was salty that I, a warrior, rolled need on a spear. Mage retaliate by rolling need on big bad pauldrons (plate armor) and accuses me of planning to vendor the spear and that's why he needed. He also complained earlier that I had gotten a few pieces of mageweave from graves and didn't share.
---
2. Run two, A dps leaves the group and we invite a warrior to replace. The warrior upon running in gets a train of over 10 mobs following him and rather than just run back out or take a death he drags the whole group to the team and wipes us. He somehow tries to claim it was an accident  event though he typed "big train coming" as he is riding up to us. Then he tries to blame us by saying "why were you OOM"
---
3. Run three, good group but the pulls are a bit slow. The tank is doing the "wait until literally everyone is at 100% Mana and then count to ten before pulling" thing which drives me nuts because it breaks up the action, makes it hard to stay attentive, and slows down runs by a lot. I simply ask if we can have a but less downtime before pulls, and three people in the group start bitching about dungeon cleave which is not at all what I was suggesting. I am pointing out they are misinterpreting my request and the healer complains that if I only knew what it was like to heal I would understand. I tell him then that I mailed a shaman for 4 years including through vanilla and he then goes "ok, good luck" and leaves the group. Two other people in the group blame me for the healer leaving.
---
This was all in about 3-4 hours of playtime. People are getting pretty and shitty and it sucks
---
I mean, I fish on Warcraft at work.
---
Yea i can't recommend having alts enough, i started main'ing one class and now main'ing a completely different one, thanks to my little army of alts lol. And yet i still think i'm going to hunter in the end lol. Love this game!
---
Asking people "what should i play" becomes highly subjective and is why you also need to research them, and read why people are passionate about their class, and then ultimately try out the ones which sound interesting to you.
---
Having a couple or few classes to play is awesome actually, and not becasue it's the best way to farm rest xp, but have to admit that is one sweet perk to that play style.
---
I had at least 3 drop for my lvl 20 hunter in places like Loch Modan. I mail them to my starting casters. Any greens that drop are going to be a few lvls lower than the area they drop in, so it helps to have a higher lvl character get them.
---
Or use the atlasloot addon to search dungeons drop tables for your lvl.
---
Exactly why I refuse to take this talent. #NoThanks
---
We didn't kill a Titan in ulduar - just someone working for them.
---
Oh wow, this happened to me too on day 1 as I was taking the Druid FP to Thunder Bluff, dropped me right over the Troll Village in Darkshore so I got to enjoy that.
---
and for what is the second line of the macro?
---
Yeah I don't get why people post on the ah for vendor price or 1c higher... You lose money from the deposit! Just everyone undercutting like there's no tomorrow
---
Hi, /u/p3rn1nha

So hard to tell lol.
---
Quick shots has the same icon as SoC. Hence the hunter.
---
True enough, but that's just another reason why he shouldn't be tanking Uldaman at 40
---
Can someone help me track down whomever has the name Luffy on Stalagg?  Is there a way to even do this?
---
No (yes).
---
How do you get those durations on the nameplate?
---
Clearly not playing paladin
---
They are in the village on the north east side.
---
The mentality that everything should be obtainable to everyone is part of what ruined retail.
---
&gt; its not just 25% more damage which is big
---
Holy gets +10% + spell power, which smite scales way better with than mind blast. I think it's closer than you are giving credit.
---
&gt; its also a 15% phys dmg reduction.
---
I'm not sure I see why 15% damage reduction is so great when Holy gets 15% healing efficiency (effects cancel) in addition to other great healing bonuses like Spiritual Guidance.
---
&gt;  I swapped to disc/holy and my ttk on mobs was so slow it was unbearable.
---
What's your rotation? Your TTK will be slightly less, but you'll be able to chain pull endlessly if you're hitting all your marks. This is mainly because mind flay isn't breaking mana regen and holy spells are more efficient (both damage and healing). It helps a ton if you use the Spiritual Guidance + Spirit Tap combo to start the next pull strong.
---
Alright so I read it and I understand but how can I know thr names of thr bar I'm using? Especially when I use a Ui altering addon.
---
even with how popular wow classic was supposed to be after a couple weeks its already behind league on twitch again x)
---
This is like a runner refusing to wear shoes because he "likes the challenge"
---
Thank you kind sir. Your downvote fuels my inner lust for asshattery.
---
This is the most backwards thinking Ive seen in a while. Wow started out as being designed to be *fun* and turned into finding ways to make you feel the need to play everyday or fall behind.
---
Karma will catch up.  When they want to do raids and everyone is just backstabbing each other they wont be able to complain because they created that environment.
---
You shouldn’t really be running out of mana since most of your damage comes from auto shots. Typical rotation is auto shot, aimed shot, auto shot, multi shot, auto shot, filler while those are on cooldown. You can also throw a serpent sting in for the DoT. But you can just auto shot all day without many issues as long as you’re not overpulling.
---
So I would just stack agility.
---
😂
---
I really don't believe this is a real motivation.
---
Every time someone does something: "dOn'T gIvE hIm AtTeNtIoN"
---
Not all of them want attention.
---
We thought we did but we dont
---
Warrior skills are all "weapon damage + X" so how good the skill is dependent entirely on the weapon. A strong weapon is a massive powerspike for warriors.    
---
Warriors are shit without good gear and apparently wreck with great gear. I myself haven't been on the "great gear" side yet.
---
Agreed, I did this to level 45 now Pally/Warrior. Went 30 into Ret and now will go 21 into holy.
---
I bought 10 Essence of Undeath for 4g a pop and resold them all at 6g. Wasn't much but worth flipping. Aside from that, I'm staying the FUCK away from the AH under more people at 60, it's bonkers at the moment. 
---
Essence of Waterr: Monday - 6g, Tuesday - 20g, Weds - 7g, Thurs - 15g, Fri - 10g.
---
Monday seems the be the best day to buy cheap as loads of people offload their shit on Sunday evening when they log for the evening.
---
reporting goes into a month long queue, making a reddit post that explodes gets things fixed in like 4 hours.
---
Every single gold farming for mount video i see has someone who has skinning.  Where would you recommend a level 35 go to grind out gold?
---
Why is your idea of what was "good" more correct than anyone else's idea of what will be "good"?
---
A dedicated level 60 can stop you from fleeing very effectively. Corpse camping is a thing for a reason, the only real response to it is to have high level friends willing to help out or to just log out.
---
Either way, you have to be a serious piece of shit to corpse camp lvl 30-40s for hours on end and I don't feel bad for that dude one bit.
---
The game was harder back then because nobody knew what to do. You would go into MC and have bo idea what you were looking at. Every fight was trial and error. Now everyone is watching YouTube videos and has exact to the second live updates during fights of boss mechanics
---
Blizzard should have seen this coming and boosted hp and damage of bosses by 25-50%.
---
My favorite part of raiding back then was the fact that boss fights seemed to take 15 minutes and one mistake from a single raid member wiped the group. Now its trivial because we know and expect everything.
---
Thanks for the links. I plan to use them when I'm 60.
---
But wow. Just looked up what a HOTW build is... Now you have me intrigued. I was planning to go some sort of feral build that allowed me to be a good offtank but also have PvP usefulness, but a off-tank/off-healer build? That is cool.
---
And no one knew what BiS was until fairly late on, there was little optimization across the low % of player that did raid.
---
One duel every 30 min so I can wait for all my major cooldowns to come back up =O
---
Gotta keep my win rate as high as possible xD
---
Right so, you don't understand that hunters actually need Leather Agi, and Stam, the strength is alright too. You are just angry you didn't get your loot, a rogue could of done the same. Dont be bias.
---
If I were there I would've stealthed behind you and then just sat there to make you extra nervous.
---
There are a ton of guilds out there that are mostly (or in practice only ever will be) for social and leveling and really never do much beyond dungeons, and they can be lots of fun and add a lot to your leveling experience. Loads of non-tryhard guilds out there right now don't even have one level 60 yet.
---
Also, many, many guilds in the game right now will never be able to build the critical mass for 40-man raiding, even given that it obviously can be done with super sketchy teams with people below max level. Lots of others may clear MC and think they've arrived, and then flame out later when they hit harder tiers. So lots of the guilds you see advertising "and eventually raiding" in fact never will, or won't get far with it if they try.
---
If you're super serious about raiding you'll want to find a guild that can actually do it, and guilds like that probably are not interested in you until you've at least gotten to 60 to show that you have some staying power. But there is no reason not to just find a nice guild for now that you fit in with and see where they go. It will be a long time getting there wherever you wind up, and no reason to go it all alone.
---
I play a lot of cows... I have /moo macro'd so that when I buff a priest or mage I can spam /moo at them until they buff me. Works 90% of the time.
---
To be fair dagger rogue is currently bugged and crits way less often than it should.
---
Thanks. I did the Google image search myself.
---
French here, you can add the qwerty keyboard and get those “sweet” boys
---
Agreed, it was just a convenient excuse to do what they wanted.  They were fine the first 45 minutes of the dungeon being streamed lol.
---
There's a post for this rght now in /hot, they recommend deleting or renaming a few .ogg files for that mount.
---
Hey mate, 30-50 is definitely a slog so it will feel really slow compared to the first 30.
---
Questing is a good way to break up the monotony of dungeons or skip them if you don't like dungeons very much but I doubt it will compete with the XP/hour. You can punch out 20-30k xp/hour in Scarlet Monastery pretty easily and it just gets even better in Zul'Farrak at 44. And that's what I can do as a rogue, if you can get a dedicated AOE farm group (e.g: 3x mage), it will be substantially higher.
---
As a warrior, my best recommendation is just tanking the dungeons. Don't bother with a prot spec though, level with fury/arms and just tank using things like taunt (pull aggro off teammate) + defensive stance
---
Otherwise I can highly recommend [classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling)
---
Why do they have 100s next to their names?
---
Oh yeah that sounds totally fine.
---
When I did my quest and undead warrior was doing his. I helped him first and after I beckoned him to help me with mine.
---
He was a good human once.
---
Not in here mister. This is a swift brown steed.
---
There are some DPS builds for paladin with deep retribution being the most popular. You can do some great burst damage, but because of a lack of mobility paladins struggle to close the melee gap. That’s not to say paladins aren’t good in PvP because there are builds that will do work. In terms of raw damage output  though, they are very gear-dependent. The holy reck build is probably the most consistent PvP viable spec. It allows you to be almost unkillable. This build uses a strategy that involves outlasting your opponent rather than using raw damage to kill them. You’ll take a chunk of life from then here and there until they simply run out of mana or have used all their important cool downs. Then you finish them off.
---
So paladins aren’t the best at DPS but they are damn good at PvP if played correctly
---
Take me bull daddy...
---
Except there are already laws against this....
---
I fucking knew there was a reason that plainstrider chased me all the way to Ratchet. Demon skin has been forsaken for the time being.
---
Finding people to group with you for a long time is hard because everyone is at different stages of their questing/leveling and people have different ways they want to adventures. I would recommend to not get hung up on having that dedicated one person to adventure with you, but try to always meet new people who are doing the same quest/dungeon as you. As you move on to new quests, you will meet a new group, finish the quest, maybe disband, but for the next quest you can gather a new group.
---
If the dungeon or quest went rly well, you can add them and maybe in future you can ask those people if they wanna quest together again. But if not, you can always find new people. You will meet a lot of new people this way too.
---
This is a myth, and I challenge you to back it up with any real science.
---
1/5 imp AoH and 4/5 endurance
---
I wouldnt even know who to report it too.  I dont think this is grounds for really any action.  Public shaming and blacklisting is the best i can do.
---
More of an issue of several layers.
---
Tier gear is not BiS for all specs, for example. Additionally, if two warriors are actually using tier and one is 1/8 and one is 3/8 and it’s a legit upgrade for both, I’d be more tempted to give the one his first set bonus instead of having them duke it out.
---
Of course you have to balance it. Lots of peeps think that means I wouldn’t put the shunned player higher on the list if the next fight dropped something that was again an upgrade for both, etc.
---
During wod my buddies internet went down.
---
He tethered to his phone and we played for several hours. It only used like 256mb for the whole day.
---
No one's giving up when they're in the late 50s
---
Ruler of PVP will be the mage.
---
Overall any class you're good at will be great in pvp.

Great, fucking great, lets just have fucking be bugged why don't we blizzard

Because pvp is fun, and the world without pvp(leveling) is a walk in the park, zero threats.
---
Ha, well when you put it that way you take all the fun out of it.  At the time this was an accomplishment and now I'm getting a do-over with Classic where I'm *not* abandoning the character so yes, I do find it exciting.
---
I’m actually 26 lol. I’ve seen it too often from even people in my age bracket. They get too accustomed to say... talking to a girl on tinder, by the time they meet up in person they feel awkward. I’ve heard that story dozens of times. In person communication is irreplaceable IMO.
---
Shit posts are only funny the first time man. Shit reposts, not so much.
---
Yeah... I was killing skeletons in desolate yesterday when a horde rogue was getting overwhelmed with chain pulls. So I helped him out by killing the mob he tagged, waiting for him to tag the next one and then killing that mob. He did a /thank and sat down to eat, I went on to another mob. Out of nowhere a group of three alliance just come in and obliterate him... welp...
---
Who pissed in your Cheerios? Maybe this the person's first character? Maybe the person is 12? Maybe they don't have any friends outside of this game and want some interaction? Maybe this is their first MMO and so leveling at all is their first time ever progressing. 
---
You're coming off as a douche. You don't like reading people in a community congratulating someone on reaching a new level then leave the community. They are probably better off without you anyway.
---
I disagree. I don't think looking for group was bad until they made it cross-realm that's when players stopped caring about being respectful in Dungeons and friendly. 
---
I feel they should add something that allows players to at least add their name to a list with a role they like so that it's a lot more organized than it currently is. I understand that this is the pur classic experience but this is exactly what I'm talking about when I say things can and should be improved. It would only make it easier for the average player to get into a group and actually see the content and do it.
---
How so? It looks like layers have the same 3,000 player limit that was used in Vanilla.
---
To be honest, I have no idea. My first guess would be, that it should flag them. Because polymorph definitely flags you for pvp
---
But in my situation I play as a hybrid, especially while leveling. I spend nearly as much time healing as I spend in cat and bear form hitting things. If I joined as a dps, I'd probably be mediocre and my healing would be mostly wasted with another healer around.
---
If it's based on talents, I currently have no points spent to improve my healing at level 20 despite joining groups as healer with my healer gear set.
---
the a-word probably
---
I have full shadoweave and think it looks bad ass
---
Calm down, drama queen.
---
yah that armor tabard combo seems nice...
---
What level is it?
---
Finally the week I've been waiting for!
---
39 Twink, elemental or resto?  I'm torn, they both seem like so much fun and both very capable for healing and damage.  Which one is more fun though, and which pairs best with another enhancement shaman?
---
Right now I'm leaning resto because of NS and improved ghost wolf.  Sell me on both!
---
Also, any guides out there for 39?  I've been looking a lot with no success.
---
It's got the rare marker on the nameplate. The elite marker is a gold dragon.
---
go on the server and /who luffy and hope hes online ?
---
Sorry, this is me..if I'm going past you, you will receive all my dots and a /pat and I'm on my way. If you are aoe farming, sure as shit, I'm fearing you and grabbing popcorn.
---
I'll take a look at this. Is this because you need to heal the pet? (I've only done Deadmines, which could be too low-level for healing pets)
---
You are clearly 12 years old
---
Lucky dog
---
Yep, I walked through the road after this took place, didn't know what happened, and was wondering why there were literally a couple hundred skeletons littering the hallways.
---
There are numerous bugs and things that are fun or silly but cause relatively low impact on the overall health of the game. While I understand it's technically different from how it was, this is just a tool for same faction griefing and has no bearing on anything concrete gameplay wise except to drive people away. 
---
This is NOT a balance change to make a class or ability relevant, it's anti griefing.
---
First off, you've got TONS of time before 40, I wouldn't worry too much about grinding. 
---
Secondly, the best way to get gold quickly is to level up quickly. Gold gain accelerates as you level, so for now just focus on getting your level high and don't worry too much if you can't afford a mount right at 40, it'll still be faster in the long run.
---
Agreed!  Some people in-game express excitement for the honor system so they can wpvp.  In fact the honor system makes wpvp worse, turning it into a gank/grind and discouraging town battles via dishonorable kills.
---
Cya. You will not be missed.
---
I wonder if this is a PvP only problem. I've definitely had mobs crit through my shield.
---
priest have racial spells.
---
dwarf:  self heal and fearward, best race for ally
---
human: self heal and shield that burns mana
---
nelf: stupid channeled damage spell and increase dodge/reduce range damage spell
---
troll: hex to reduce damage done and "thorns like" shield, best pve horde priest due to troll racial spell (decrease cast time)
---
undead: thorns/damage reduction shield and an extra Dot, best horde pvp. will of the forsaken
---
bump still need help please.
---
And you must be 14 or have the capabilities of a 14 year old.  This game isnt elite and barring a dps spec because it doesnt parse the highest is just dumb.
---
!remind me 1year.
---
This is what I don’t understand about PvP. Like, where’s the fun in a 5v1? And then why do you feel the need to just grind someone into the group by corpse camping? How is that fun? Same question to level 60s running through lowbie zones and mercing everyone in sight. I realize you ‘sign up’ for it when you pick a PvP server, I don’t tend to get upset with it, I just don’t understand it. I love the heart pumping action of being jumped by someone in my range or seeing someone out in the world and being wary of what they’re gonna do. But a gnome mage 30 levels higher who takes the time to chase me down is just pathetic.
---
Yeah, my warlock is at 39 ... slowly grinding its ass to 40 now .. with a huntard at 19 - same :) if i still go too fast i jump to my warrior (sub 10 still think he is to enjoy this game, the zones the quests and the walking around again....
---
And i have yet to start on the other faction still ....
---
I dunno, all I know is TBC was when I started losing interest in WoW. Here's what I remember tho
---
Flying mounts made world PvP a thing of the past.
---
Lore was complete dog shit 
---
The arrival of TBC put a lot of people off Naxxramas (because what was the point?) Which is probably my favourite raid of all time 
---
End of 40 man raids 
---
Both horde and alliance just became a bastardised version of the other (with the introduction of BE pallys and draenei shammys)
---
This of course is just my opinion. I'm sure there are plenty of people who loved TBC, and that's absolutely fine
---
I was just trying to point out that all the shadow benefits you were mentioning has a holy answer too.
---
It's fun and way more tense than on a pve server.
---
Sure there's shit times like when a ?? corpse camps you for 20 minutes, but then you just log out, go to an alt, level a bit, and log back in after an hour and they'll have left
---
Make a character on Stalagg and /w them. Why are you trying to track them down? Want to beg them to give up the name so you can have it?
---
Can confirm, just the mere act of PLAYING a rogue makes you behave like a thief in the night. It's fun!
---
Yeah, I didn't respec shadow till 44 because I don't think it's worth it without the higher ranked MF; even with shadowform. MF being sub-par is why I recommend Spirit tap -&gt; Disc for leveling pre-44; if you aren't using MF the only real boost you're getting from shadow is shadow weaving/imp SW:P; which is even worse when you aren't using MF to get stacks.
---
Dude I’m in the same boat I really can’t decide, because that’s kinda the turning point in your dedication to the character. I have a 29 Druid 24 mage and 23 hunter. Ahhhhh
---
25
---
Oh lol, sorry my bad
---
It's based on player uploads so that depends how many are doing it.
---
Where
---
Currently lvl 30, had a friend help me farm the tusks. Bought all 24 charms off AH for about 3g and now today I go turn in all the mats to slay the elite beast!!
---
&gt; Had someone tell me they were just going to spam run BRD for ironfoe
---
literally almost everyone at 60 is doing shit like this right now haha
---
I agree that PvP can be fun in a leveled playing field, I used to LOVE battlegrounds. Is the constant feeling of not being safe that much fun though? At level 60 I suppose you can defend yourself well enough, but before that I would just feel like fodder.
---
.... I don't know anything about this kind of limitation... never mentioned anywhere else either.
---
This happens on a lot of subs. Maybe the mods change the rules or whatever but TBH that particular rule sounds like it could be applied to just about anything posted. So it just comes down to how the mod feels when they see it or the reports on it. I remember posting something in thathappened that I thought was brilliant, it got locked or deleted for violating some rule and like 5 hours later the same exact thing was back up posted by someone else with a bunch of comments and upvotes. Made me pretty bummed but ultimately I just stopped posting there since I felt it wasn't worth the time to try and skirt around how a particular mod in a particular sub interprets the rules.
---
The addon pratz can do that, you can change each channel's name :)
---
Post list
---
Imagine playing on a PvE server
---
Bamboozled.
---
i think it might be how the modern game is made too that’s doing that. it’s all focused on endgame so maybe people think that and are trying to get there faster
---
This seems like a pretty big bug to fly under the radar for so long.
---
Damn bro, chill
---
Well, I don't need to... I like to. There are rare situations where I look over and the big cat is dead from aoe or cleaves, the hunters then need food to keep the pet happy. Warlocks have to farm a new soul every time their demon dies too.
---
I didn't say they were wrong.
---
Just dont understand the logic of killing someone 10 levels lower and spending 30 minutes sitting on a corpse
---
Sure, by that logic... why not rebalance PvP, add more spells to share DR or better yet, add in transmog since people don't like the look of their set pieces?
---
It's not about me not being able to grief people, its being told by a developer that we will release vanilla EXACTLY how it was in 1.12 ... and then go against that. I was fine with the layering because it was only a temporary deal which they promised will be taken away eventually... but now it just looks like they are again trying to re-balance a game and take the fun out of it, kinda like retail..scratch that, EXACTLY like retail.
---
 RemindMe! One Year
---
Can you give some tips for positioning?
---
- Try and get your back to a wall and do not break line of sight from your healer.
---
- Once you are in a good position avoid unnecessary movement. Your melee DPS will have an easier time being behind the targets if you stay still.
---
- Also if you are still the mobs are also generally not going to move if you or a melee DPS have threat, makes it easier to see when one mobs runs off to your healer or casters.
---
I'm pretty bad about rage management, any advice there?
---
- Rage generation sucks until prot spec at max level when you can take talents to improve it.
---
- Avoid using things that cost rage that don't have extra threat modifiers on them when you are rage starved. Prioritize cycling Sunders evenly across targets.
---
I tend to panic when I start losing aggro on more than a couple mobs. I'm finally starting to learn i don't need to have all of them on me all the time, but sometimes things go to shit and idk where to start. If my challenging shout is on CD how should i begin reestablishing threat/aggro?
---
- The above advice should help you here. Better positioning, less movement and a better use of rage for establishing threat should help to alleviate these issues.
---
- Any melee DPS you can take to OT should help you here, find yourself another warrior buddy or a pocket enhancement shaman. Shamans are amazing to support warriors. They have mail to Offtank, they provide WF totem to boost your damage and threat, they have a short CD ranged taunt + interrupt in Earth Shock which is great for pesky casters and do way more DPS than a Ret paladin. Be Horde ;)
---
I know my dps is going to be pretty low for the most part, but I also know I need to keep threat. Is there a rule of thumb for damage output from tank vs dps?
---
- High threat abilities are more important than "DPS to keep threat". Revenge might have lower damage than some things single target, but it has high threat on it.
---
- Low DPS as a tank is a symptom of all of the issues you are having, improving in areas like positioning and threat management will have you panicking less and able to focus more which will always bring up your DPS. But as you rightly stated, it's not the end of the world, if your party lives, you've done a good job ;)
---
I've got my macros set up for stance dance and I'm pretty smooth with transitioning from one to another, but should i stay in battle stance for longer than it takes for me to get off an overpower or whatever?
---
- Overpower and Revenge share a cooldown, being in Defensive stance and using Revenge causes more threat, so swap to Defensive as soon as you can for survivability and threat generation.
---
I really like the advice you've provided so far, thank you for providing insight to a total noob such as myself!
---
- You are welcome and I hope this helps further :)
---
I've barely seen any of his videos, yet I still can't stand his fucking face.
---
As an mostly group PvE player I have no issue with that. BC was the time I was active the most, too, and I loved the heroics and most of the raids.
---
But it also had shit like flying, the "alien" world, space ships, dailies and some other crap that I disliked.
---
You watch to many movies
---
I don’t think there is a level requirement for summoned players.
---
Oh sweet. What actionbar addon gets the cords/castbar? Can you give me a name?
---
Realm transfers are permanent. Here if you make a mistake you just wait out the week and hop back.
---
If you're talking about friendly nameplates reverting to blizzard style in dungeons, that's not a bug. Blizzard made it so addons can't change friendly nameplates in dungeons.
---
Mesmerize
---
Lol the whole reason why dual spec was added was because people respec multiple times a week in some cases. It's also why they drop the respec cost by 5g each month.
---
What if you are currently playing your off spec and need it for your main soec? Or, what if your spec wears different gear while leveling than when in dungeons?
---
This mostly a leveling issue obviously.
---
WoW started as a casual take on MMOs like Everquest at the time. It had addictive mechanics in mind just as much as retail does.

Rage acts as a multiplier for damage stats. If you do more damage, you generate more rage, which then deals more damage. They basically get more bang for their buck when it comes to stats.
---
r/iamverysmart
---
&gt;I'd like it if they kept the things about TBC that worked and changed what didn't. 
---
I doubt they will do that, because they also didn't do it with Classic. And Classic has a LOT of things that should be changed to make it a better game.
---
I like to believe every clever priest knew this and was just hoping nobody noticed. "Oh me? Nooo, I just heal, I'm a friendly guy, I give stam buffs, I'm definitely not invincible while sitting down, I just like to drink a lot!^(fuck off rogues)"
---
Or maybe they’re younger, not taking into consideration that an old man is sitting here being mad over someone saying ding in gchat.
---
This makes me gag a bit
---
Lol, Asmongold tweeting it at Blizzard guarantees their attention though, whether you like him or not should be irrelevant.
---
That was tbc or wrath I think, vanilla has no level restrictions
---
Higher damage doesn’t equal faster dps, your time to kill a target is better then just hitting bigger numbers. And this sounds like it’s only useful if I spec into MM. I am BM and in PvP encounter I find I win more with faster weapons and I always toast a hunter who’s try’s to aim shot me by casting my pets interrupt. So no your explanation does not makes since but further make me wonder how you think it does if Aimed shot is the only reason here.
---
ok but how can a guy that i just ganked figure out my battlenet?
---
My guild is in 5 different layers, we all have to leave to character select screen to meet at the same layer. You are just adding steps that dont solve any problems
---
Adding their names and roles to a list?
---
You mean like they implemented in Tbc?....
---
Brutal death penalty? In wow? Lmao
---
&gt;Had a mutual agreement with a human warrior
---
How do you know you had an agreement? What if he was just waiting for the odds to be more in his favor? Warriors aren't great 1v1 and if he's 3 levels lower it would be suicide to attack you unless he was confident in his skills/gear. 
---
Makes total sense to not do shit until more teammates showed up to help.
---
You killed a level 15 !? You're clearly a psychopath and need meds kid. /s
---
If I buy artwork does it really need to be both the art and a indencent distracting social media plug for the creator? Jeesh way to make me not want to buy it.

Yeah I just should ignore that everything is bugged and be happy big daddy blizzard finally releaased a shit version of the game I was already playing, and now I have to pay for it?

&gt;*Immediately after* the Distributed Denial of Service attacks against our game service began, the Blizzard Security Team worked around the clock with local and international law enforcement agencies to track down the source of the DDoS.

---
Will not upvote /Runescape
---
That's cool, I would still say something to the group first.
---
The fact is most mods suck.
---
I mostly grinded a couple pf times out or choice. Bug pit in shimmering flats when i needed mithril. Nagas in azshara at level 50, since rich thorium nodes spawn there. Gets old, though, and I end up leaving to quest or pvp after a bit.
---
How about the answer that they actually figure this shit out?
---
They are absolutely not permanent. You can transfer again after 72 hours.
---
You are identically describing a realm transfer. You’re just calling it “layers” instead of realms.
---
You want free realm transfers all the time, and that would cause an immense amount of issues, solving nothing, and making the current issues worse.
---
Naturally, everyone would flock to the most populated serv-sorry, I mean “layer” because it’s the only way to play with your guild, your friends, or even progress in the game (this is an MMO, remember that). Meaning anyone on the other layers would be starved for content. 
---
Further to this, elite guilds would designate certain groups to take over grinding spots in specific layers, shutting out anyone outside of their circle. They would pool their resources, and have even MORE than they do now.
---
You’re not fixing anything with this idea. You’re making things much worse.
---
I would go with Druid as the least played solely based on being locked to one race.  If a player doesn't enjoy the Tauren, they are probably not going to roll druid (regardless if you know you stay in forms most of the time)
---
Yah but that’s a level 50 quest, you can get the +20 pole at ~35
---
Gimli: He fell
---
Literally just join a guild that doesn't have more than like 150 people.
---
You'll make friends. Guilds are the most social this game gets, so join one and make yourself known.
---
I group up with guildies every day for like two weeks now.
---
&gt; At the same time, they're listing realms as full in the same way that retail ones are listed as full, by the formula of potential players rather than actual players at any one given moment.
---
Is this not incorrect? Blizzard reclassified realm population tags about two weeks ago to reflect actual online players. Full realms have a queue because they are at capacity.
---
I signed in as dps/healer.
---
37 reseto sham here. totally viable. I did put my first 11 in enh for 2h axes (windfury procs on corpsemaker will sometimes one shot!)
---
this is more or less my build  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-50222001-550350010553151](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-50222001-550350010553151) 
---
im pulling with flame shock and using only one cast of lightning shield as well as my flame totem. If i am setting up shop and chain pulling i will 100% drop mana spring to reduce down time. down rank your heals so you dont over heal and you should have minimal mana issues.  
---
Honestly if you dont want to use 2h axes or maces, staves work very well for damage too if you can find a nice slow high end damage one.

Then go tank the dungeons...it doesn't matter what your spec is. We had a resto druid solo tank ubrs last night.
---
good try.
---
much better than all the ones QQ'ing because we aren't playing classic like they play classic.
---
The second one.
---
The AP bonus scales based on weapon speed. Slower weapon is more AP.
---
In what situations would I use down ranking for polymorph other than to save some mana?
---
Yeah, I don't know how other people are getting a shadow bolt off, they run out of range so fast, maybe they should increase the range of sb..... lol
---
lmfao what
---
If that was the case, why wasn't a heads up given on this? If I recall correctly, the developers made it very clear that the good things AND the bad things would be kept in classic WoW. I believe the devs even acknowledged it as an unbalanced mess, but said that their is a market for that. This fooled a lot of people to thinking we'd be getting a carbon copy of vanilla WoW, and then being sold something that isn't.
---
Thank you for the help! I updated my ElvUI Classic to the latest version last night, and adjusted all my buff duration min/max filters to zero.
---
This provided most of the basic buffs I wanted to see  like Fortitude, Arcane Intellect and Blood Pact. But I did notice some were missing like my food buff iirc.
---
I really appreciate your letting me know how to manually add those I find I’m missing. I’ll run through your instructions when I get home!
---
Ooooh I'm dumb. I thought you were saying you abandoned the current character and rerolled.
---
It adds another entire dimension to the game that creates all kinds of interesting moments and talking points. Yeah some of them are annoying and frustrating but there is also a lot of hilarious, fun and exciting moments.
---
Last week my GF and I were leveling in Ashenvale, running down the road and we see 4 Alli in the distance. They close on us and engage, she turns and hauls it the other way in cat form. I fear bubble and do what I can to prolong the inevitable. I'm at 10% health when over the hill comes a group of Horde. Their priest hits me with a clutch heal topping me off, GF turns around and we turn and take them all out. After we grouped up and had a nice exchange and a good laugh and made some new friends. 
---
We have had way more encounters like this than we have had high levels ganking us for the fun of things. Totally worth while trade off IMO.
---
Works in retail as well, just there's way less consequences due to flying and many speed increases to make your way back to where you fell from.
---
Indeed, multiple races, classes and interresting routes through different zones to level, meet others, team up have fun time together.... unless you rush to 60 and dive into the raids you should not need to get bored quickly.
---
But it depends on what you expected from Classic....
---
That... took a turn. I should expect these things.
---
I think it’s because of the level 100 mark next to his name? I could be totally off base though
---
Tbh its rly wierd. Since classic came out i made friends with like 10+ peeps plus my guild without even trying:)
---
...who has ever said that tier armor is terrible?
---
Not if he is leveling as BM, as I assume he is. And fast weapons own in pvp, casters basically cant cast if you have a 1.0-1.2 speed pet and a fast weapon.
---
This is literally the worst idea I've ever heard. 
---
Forget to change later on reset day? Too bad you aren't raiding this week.
---
I believe you don't need the button:1 and button:2 in the first line of your poison macro.  I have a poison macro something like this (not at my pc so its from memory).  The tooltip will change as you press the modifiers.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /use [nomod] Instant Poison; [mod:ctrl] Wound Poison; [mod:shift] Crippling Poison; [mod:alt] Mind Numbing Poison
---
    /use [button:1] 16; [button:2] 17
---
queues on thalnos went from 2-3k to nothing.
---
and supposely the server capacity is getting reduced?
---
and most people still haven't reached 60?
---
A frostball does X damage. Frostballs damage isn't dependent on the weapons damage, only on level of the spell. 
---
Heroic strike is weapon damage +X. Meaning that two different weapons deal completely different kind of damage with the same ability.   
---
So, warriors for the most part get straight up ability upgrades with each better weapon whilst mages do not
---
Not saying they can't ban me, I'm saying they shouldn't. Or at least, they should give me an up-front explanation of how exactly they're justifying the suspension.
---
it was late (12pm EST) im sure they just wanted to get the instance over with and move on with life.
---
See alliance will let you play.
---
I saved a rogue yesterday from pulling too many mobs by pulling threat off him and when I was weak from dealing with the extras he instantly kills me.
---
Think he’s using ElvUI. Enemy castbar is a part of that.
---
It's generally accepted that if you're in a pubbie group to just roll need on everything.
---
I think you'll find this situation impossible to recreate with a level 60 versus anyone sub level 40.
---
Well, the attitude in your reply makes a good point in why you'd need to have it explained to you.
---
Yea the lfg chat window is a necessity...and trade chats not a bad idea for its own window too
---
lol seems like you're a lot madder than I am friendo
---
The game glitched during transition to EK and we ported to TB graveyard.
---
 I was watching some old raiding videos and came across some by the paladin Zalgradis from stature of the gods guild on the Al'akir server. I noticed that in most of these videos they were wearing tier2 in aq40 instead of the greens and blues. This is Princess huhuran from AQ40 where you needed nature resistance, but maybe you actually don't need it and can just go with whatever?
---
not (A and B) = not A or not B, so yes?
---
/cancelform will trigger unless you are both holding alt and in form 3
---
Lol you're probably one of those people that want their ass kissed by a random exec huh?
---
I'm exactly the same. Oh I can save like 0.5-3 whole bucks if I sub for 6 months right away? Well I'll still save a LOT more if I just pay monthly and well... Don't pay anything if I don't play for a month.
---
Yes, I enjoy the uneasiness of contested zones.
---
Was meant to be a joke... prot... arms... fury... still a warrior... still gear dependant as all hell.
---
I am on blowme (Blaumeux, us pacific server). I have been killed just not camped.
---
You don’t spam aimed shots
---
&gt;sit macro
---
X is sit by default. No need for a macro
---
Already been said a few times: Classic Transmog
---
Nothing like playing a Paladin and being forced to look like a random put together cloth wearer since you have to heal.  Then you can at least change your look to plate to rock that paladin vibe.
---
You at least agree that content is more than just raiding.
---
(Even raiding itself is largely social.)
---
Ah, that makes sense! [The wowhead entry for Rockbiter Weapon made me think it was static and didn't scale with speed.](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=8017/rockbiter-weapon)
---
One problem is that he spawns in Moonbrook. Which is full of people doing the second part of The People's Militia. So even if there's no one there who actually needs to kill him, he becomes collateral damage anyway.
---
Do you really not see how locking someone out of playing with their friends/guild for a week at a time is a stupid fucking idea
---
Big congrats!
---
The agreement was I didn’t murder him and he didn’t bother me or try to slow me down while I was grinding. 
---
And yeah when more people showed up he tagged along and broke that peace, so he paid the price for the next hour or so every time I saw him.
---
Someone should've gone to his programming class more, because you see, little Tommy, Rollback are a thing for even the smallest MMO out there, and massive inflation doesn't matter if you can actually literally bring back the world in time before the economy was inflated, and surely nobody here would have any problem with losing a little bit of progress in exchange of a cleaner economy, right? Lmao who am I kidding anyway they have enough money to support character-specific rollback so there is literally no excuse on that front  
---
So frankly if Blizzard's WoW division both can't think ahead about the obvious consequence of layering, can't fucking rollback characters and/or servers, \_and\_ end up banning people for the consequence of those mistakes, they should really start reconsidering their values again
---
Nice 1g.
---
&gt; You can literally get PW:S then sit macro through dungeons taking 0 damage
---
I just tested with Ice Barrier and Mana Shield. A guildie tested with PW:S. They are getting broken by mob criticals just fine.
---
what are you even arguing lmfao. yes they learned classic wow was addicting and their formula worked, so they pushed it even more.
---
Its fine if you say it but you shouldn't be obligated to say gz to people when they do say ding
---
on it !
---
Looting frame?
---
play on kronos dude, dont give a cent to activision
---
Thanks for all the answers guys, seems Classic doesn't restrict by level. On a private server i used to play on before Classic, a lock couldn't summon somebody more than 10 levels higher. Glad to know i can help my 60s out and summon them to their raid later.
---
Thank-you for this. As someone who mains a tank, I cry a little whenever I see people asking about this build for leveling/new-60. It isn't a build I'll do myself, but I can appreciate what goes into it.
---
If you are planning on going ele like me, Tauren is a no brainer. Beside the fact that you can combo people with war stomp with burst, you get a hidden racial of having an extra 2.5 yards on your spells. May not seem like much but that extra range helps you engage people before they are ready. Also, I played orc on pservers and the stun resist winning a fight for me in the grand scheme of things was very slim. But a well timed war stomp won me a ton of fights or helped me get away.
---
Heeey westfall! 
---
Im probably running ulda tonight if you want to do it again. 43 pally tank
---
Are you gonna be ok? Does mommy need to bring you a fresh plate of tendies?
---
Dont do it 4-5 time in a row ... try it once every day, or every week .. try it on different roles tank, heal or DPS - even different classes. PvP at the entrance and piss off/frustrate the other faction .. if they come in groups call in for help...
---
2 rooms in Booty Bay were unsafe. don't go in those rooms over and over again, and you don't die over and over again. :)
---
So you think the instanced boss resets that people were banned for last week was okay since it was in the game and everyone could do it?
---
Yeah, I hate that feeling too, but the catch is, you are not actually obliged. So just don't say any of it if you do not want to. It's not like anyone cares and will deem you as a bad person, unless, of course, you ignore something directly.
---
Make the game the exact way I want and kiss my ass so I will play it. 
---
-wow players 2019
---
"Bwahahaha I am a GOD you puny MORTAL!" 
---
*Gets two shot by someone his level*
---
Can’t wait for *f r e s h*
---
Its atrocious for MM only. Its preferred to have a fast weapon in pvp against casters. Hurricane is better than anything he will get until blackcrow anyway. No one lvls MM anyway.
---
for real, that's exactly how it felt in 2004. I must have spent a week pathing back and forth looking for him, seeing his corpse was the worst part, seemed (to me) like very few people were trying to get him at first and more often than not you'd see his body and just die a little.
---
true, forsaken are always KoS
---
Ofc, I talk shit about blizzard and the shills come real quick
---
That's just silly lol, what you've done in this comment is just labelled something which is quite clearly a discrepancy to vanilla WoW, and said "nono this is different, this is anti-griefing". Ok, what else falls under this category? Every single rogue which can grief just as bad in world pvp in lower level zones? I mean, that's griefing right?
---
The fact that it’s possible to do it doesn’t mean it’s a nice thing to do. You’re allowed to be a dick. But you’re still a dick.
---
Wait they really normalized it wtf...
---
Gravestone is a dungeon quest reward, and a grossly overstatted one at that. It's just way out of line for how early you can get it. There's also not many dungeon wands (one from a rare mob in SM) in that level range either. It takes until about 40 for quest reward wands to be a significant improvement.
---
Then eat the corpses as undead rogue.
---
Because people didn’t know better. There wasn’t nearly as much info as today, nobody knew that their BiS was not this rare item from boss but this random world drop/crafted piece.
---
You're really suggesting people do the math by hand? My census picked up 26,000 unique characters a week ago, on just Horde Skeram side. Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
I can, I hate AV lol. I dont look forward to having to grind the rep for the ring on holiday weekend with people yelling "zomg stop turtling and let them win, quicker honor and rep that way" nonstop
---
Is there any way to counter engineering since everyone will do it for battlegrounds?
---
Cyrotek you are a poignantly venomed Apollyon!
---
You were given the answer already. For a warrior, damage makes their resource: rage. Rage makes more damage. The graph of a warrior's damage as they level and get gear looks like y=x^2. The graph of other classes' damage looks like y=mx+b.
---
Stats, weapons, and spell power increase b for other classes. A mage with more spell power or more intellect isn't going to generate more mana so they can throw more spells, they're just going to throw spells harder. A hunter with more agility is just going to shoot a little harder. They're both going to be gated and limited by their mana pools. Rogues are gated by their energy.
---
A warrior with a better weapon is going to generate more rage, which he's going to use to do more damage, which he is going to use to get more rage, which he is going to use to do more damage, which he's going to use to get more rage.
---
LMAO 
---
CLASSIC GOOD
---
BFA BAD
---
UPVOTE ME PLEASE YES? PLS UPVOTE THIS
---
The answer is nothing, as far as I am aware. Broken record is beginning to be fun at this point
---
*laughs in cat form* not today, young priest, not today.
---
Seriously think that phase 4 is out in 8 months?  That's a bold assumption.
---
Hey Josh, thanks for all the work. I've just got one comment to throw your way, hopefully it reaches ya. There was a sentiment at one point in the pod that suggested that the dungeon layer hopping bug could have been found and prevented if only Blizzard had extended the beta test to max level. But I have to ask, is this really the case? The bug exists for all dungeons, not just endgame instances. 
---
The general tenor across this week's podcast was pretty negative across the board, but I don't think Blizzard needs to be roasted unnecessarily. There are plenty of places to criticize, but there is no reason to believe that going to 60 would have ensured finding this bug, when we had tons of beta instance play that left it still undetected.
---
If you are killing in the same area as the opposite faction and neither of you attack one another what would you call that? 
---
It was an agreement, he broke it, he died multiple times afterwards. That’s it.
---
It’s okay really, I used to grief and get griefed on a regular basis. Don’t treat it too seriously and just have fun camping and be camped!
---
Never go Arms in raids.
---
Because your main ability (Mortal Strike) puts a useless debuff on the boss.
---
Your Deep Wounds talent puts ANOTHER useless debuff on the boss (if the boss can bleed).
---
I know DW Fury is always better ally side, not sure about scum side.
---
Well, if we are being 100% honest with ourselves....
---
Vanilla had the lowest subscriber count until the end of Mists.
---
The figurehead is what ensures a safe journey by scaring away sea monsters! Do you want sea monsters? This is how you get sea monsters!
---
You misspelled "The alliance".
---
Leveling guides, really good cleave dungeon groups, and mage aoe farming can shave maybe 10-20% off your leveling time for a normal person. They are that far ahead of you because they are playing the game way more
---
Yeah simply wrong on that. Being able to break CC on demand is much better then resisting a stun 1 out of 4 times at random.
---
Consumables will fill some of your gaps.  You mentioned restorative, which is good.  You'll also want to grab elixir of poison resistance, which will instantly remove a poison, for hunters that serpent sting before marking.  Free action potions are pretty good against frost mages that manage to escape your opener.
---
For warlocks, the pvp trinket will make a world of difference for you.  I play undead so I don't have that issue.
---
I don't really have advice for the rest.  Druids and warriors will just be tough.  For shamans... well, I'm in your paladin boat.
---
Sweet home Alabama
---
Was asking myself the same thing... I was really hyped and then it all died in a second...
---
Can I make the soul shard bags if im not a warlock?
---
Tomtom works fine for me, questie even has an option if you right click the quest to use tom to guide you
---
Lol. And what do you play?? 
---
Let me guess.  Night elf hunter ?
---
Thinking of going for a Level 49 Enhance Twink but can't decide on final placement of the last 5/10 talent points.  
---
Stormstrike is a must so my question is what is better?  
---
Toughness for +10% Armour, Anticipation for +5% Dodge, Convection for -10% Shock Mana or Concussion for +5% Shock Damage? I personally can't see the benefit of putting any in the Resto tree.  
---
Thanks in advance.
---
The guards won’t come on the boat, so you should be pretty safe to trap as long as you’re not stepping off.
---
I bought 20 on Skeram the other day for five gold a piece.
---
Needed 10 more on top of the 2 I had to craft Robe if the Void so just relisted the rest later that night for 11G. All of them sold. Which means I basically just made money by buying stuff to make my robe instead of farming it.
---
Also MC was being progressed on before the clsss rebalance
---
Can't really farm world drops per say, as the loot table is so big. By time you find a rare item or recipe it likely won't be the specific item you want it to be.
---
Vanilla WoW isn't addictive, it's just so fun that people actually want to play it non-stop.
---
But retail WoW is filled with design choices based wholly on behavioral psychology to coerce and manipulate people into playing for X amount per day, X amount of times per week. 
---
The issue is, that only works for so long---People become resistant to that and burn out, eventually becoming deeply resentful of it.
---
Can you *taste* it though? The salt, the sweat, the prickly little hairs...
---
Damage dealer?
---
All damage rotations in wow are fairly bland. I'd probably vote rogue, as combo points add one extra thing to manage beyond cd, rotation and resources. Keep snd up at all times etc.
---
Azeroth Autopilot sort of.
---
You can celebrate what it already archieved. It proved that there was *something* that was lost along the years in WoW, something that others MMOs also do not offer, that people are thristy for.
---
Yes, at least 40 minutes as I recall it. I don't remember exactly how many times I had killled him in the graveyard though. I just killed him a lot.
---
He did fight me back for the first 7 deaths. After that he started to run away.
---
Not a ton of problems but on behalf of the caster community, you’re welcome.
---
I don’t think a name can really define a gangster or not. Snoop Doggs name is a Calvin and he Gangsta as fuck!
---
You’re more prone to wipes. And wiping 2/3 of the way through a dungeon is a run killer if adds have respawned. I hear what you are saying but not understanding the mechanics sometimes ruins the run. I work 80 hours a week and it’s a bummer to have your only dungeon end because people don’t want to bother with mechanics, which is kinda the appeal of classic tbh
---
ah yea I don't need to carry different gear thankfully but engineering mats are more than enough I generally only have 1 bag worth of free space (im still using 10 slot bags)
---
I cannot seem to get a cleave done in berzerker stance with this macro, it shifts to Battle stance instead
---
Priests should be banned from using PW:S for 1 month! Outrageous!
---
Anyone remembers when you could jump on a wall between trade and mage district in sw and enter the wall To go under the City ? Can u still do it ?
---
Commenting on this visibility comment
---
It was the same for seasons in D2 and now for D3...
---
I shouldnt have worded ttk on mobs was so slow, I felt I couldnt pull a pack of 4 as easily as I can as shadow. Vampiric embrace is such a good spell it basically made life easy. In shadow my xp/hr was so much better questing. In disc/holy I felt I needed to dungeon level. Shadow I can do both and feel comfortable.
---
Is there no way to set Shoot with wand as my right mouse click??? I've been looking all through key bindings and all I see is "Attack Target" that you can bind a key to but that does melee.
---
Is your name Michael Diamond?
---
I'm in my 30's and my k-8 school had us doing computer labs from like third of fourth grade onwards.
---
We had a whole lab of oldschool apple computers, with a handful of the imac all-in-ones back when those were actually fancy.
---
This summed up all of my thoughts about this perfectly. It’s like people who’ve been playing for the whole month are just suddenly not going to resub because...? If they’ve enjoyed every second  of the first sub, why would people suddenly not resub again?
---
Thanks for making dungeon experiences worse over a piece of loot you'll replace in a few levels.
---
Honestly literally any coast in a 40+ area. Any pool has a chance but floating Wreckages are almost exclusively trunks
---
He was unbanned shortly after. It was apparently a mistake.
---
If you use questie and tomtom together you can get an arrow. Questie automatically tracks all quests (not capped at 5) and if you right click the quest theres an option to display arrow with tomtom for quest objective
---
Warriors and rogues are the most interactive. If you're 2h fury or arms, you get lots of things to do. Hunter rotation can get tricky with shot timings. Casters typically spam one or two spells.
---
Yeah, sure.
---
I didn’t mind it. I watched the first two seasons and then came back for the final chunk years later. Maybe that contributed.
---
Nah 25 is super important too. That’s the year your car insurance rates become reasonable.
---
An end to layering
---
If you ever feel like starting on Ashbringer as a horse give me a shout - Zorgus

The only outrage I see about this is...
---
*checks notes*
---
You, OP.
---
Me while questions with a friend.
---
We should kill those two!
---
Why?
---
Because we both know as soon as a third shows up they Gunna try and kill us.
---
Good point
---
dude you're like 5 layers down in a comment section on a post that already called out the problem, in a much less belligerent way.
---
nobody's listening to the 14 year old screaming at people to kill themselves cause you obviously have nothing constructive to add. go project somewhere else.
---
Lizard squad faded to obscurity so fast. I remember when they ruined Christmas for a bunch of people like 4 or 5 years ago. Whatever happened to them and their punishment
---
I've ran the census data for a few weeks, they aren't horde.  I've asked around alliance on the discord and they don't see the character either.  So I'm thinking someone snagged it just in case they ended up there and ended up going somewhere else.
---
Yes it was my vanilla name and I'd like to see if I can use it if it's gonna be a level 1 human warrior for the rest of classic.
---
Just said the same thing then refreshed to see it already stated... lol
---
Very likely there is an interaction with a talent or something besides vanilla PWS
---
Resisting 1 of 4 stuns at random is much less powerful then being able to break a CC on demand, then break a second one on demand once the PvP trinket enters the game leaving you with only 1 final disable for 3 seconds before you go immune thanks to diminishing returns.
---
When I briefly was playing BFA to kill some time before Classic, I was in this casual guild and some moron would "grats" after every achievement, so every two minutes this idiot is saying grats.  And then I actually saw him rage after a week since no one was saying grats to his own achievements.  Achievements are meaningless when they're flying through the guild chat like a kill feed in Call of Duty.
---
there is nothing wrong with the Black Slayer npc's name. if you think it's even remotely racist, YOU are the racist one. uninstall the game instead of creating a snowflake thread.
---
Orc has the most broken pvp racial in the game in form of hardiness, if your class can be orc, orc is the best race for pvp.
---
He's on a No Fly List
---
You took it pretty damn well. I would have lost my shit. Uldaman is no joke at your level. Your teammates sucked too. They should have had your back.
---
Did you think people on reddit would agree
---
Glad I'm not the only one.
---
Can't wait until they fix the camera sensitivity/leeway with FD though.
---
Did you try putting your brother in rice?

I guess I am not woke enough to be triggered by this image of an orc fighting a bird. Can someone eli5 what I should be outraged about.  Thank you.
---

---
Lok'tar!
---
I'd imagine ret pallies make great OTs too while levelling. I'm not as familiar with the utility they provide to support you as the warrior.
---
It's not WF totem, so it's never going to beat a shaman :D
---
&gt;The problem is how arena is not a balanced way to distribute rewards.
---
In BC you could go 0-10 every week for a month and get your weapon.
---
My guild required everyone to be on one of the guild 5s teams to farm weapons for raiding. 
---
PvP rewards suck in all MMOs because they inevitably let you farm gear by afk farming / losing enough matches. It almost NEVER requires any real degree of success. 
---
You can't wipe for hours without killing bosses and get rewards. Under the honor system from BC-Mists you could farm the 2nd best PvP set in the game without ever winning a single match or getting a kill. 
---
It was the definition of welfare gear and destroyed the game, but pvp players are whiny asshats who don't think playing the RPG part of the game should be a requirement for MMO PvP.
---
Are the red trunks what I should go for?in stone talon mountains there are always like 10 floating wreks because there isnt much water. The only downside is you don't get the red trunks
---
NEED FOR EDC FAM
---
What does dominos do better out of curiosity? Only use bartender and haven't lacked any functionality so wondering if I'm missing any good features.
---
Well said! I love this kind of lore and storytelling aspect of the game.
---
Your take on the story aside, it was just poorly executed in some ways, to me. I feel like the hermit could have sent you to all the corners of the world in a single quest with three different skins to fill with water, instead of making you slog back and forth to some of the most inconvenient locations in the low-level game.
---
I posted this before and my post was hidden from the feed for some reason lol https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d6vxih/bug_priests_with_pwshield_active_doesnt_take/

honestly its kinda nice to have some extra int as a hunter. Using a staff with +int isnt the worst thing in the world.

I think what you’re talking about is themepark games vs sandbox games. Vanilla WoW was a themepark game in its time, but compared to Retail it’s a bit closer to sandbox than people are used to.
---
DrUiDs CaN't MaIn TaNk! meanwhile dual wield fury warriors...
---
No kidding. I had an Uld group where most of us were around 42. We tore through most of the instance, but Arch was just not going to happen.
---
We attempted anyway, and we wiped. It's hard to kill the boss when you can't even hit him.
---
If I had to roll the bones in classic I'd shoot myself
---
Sometime my client wont register clicks even tho it highlights stuff, i alt tab and tab back and it works, fucking weird.
---
Check the other threads that get posted every day.
---
I think they are lowering server capacitt before removing layers. Not from 15k down to the 3k OP thinks. But down to 10/12k
---
Did you not read my post? I'm saying guilds would have an "official" layer where they would congregate. There would only be an issue if a player didn't get the message or forgets to switch. 
---
And you don't understand the nature of layering. The entire point is to stack more people on the servers. Remove them and only a single layer worth of people can play on a server at a time. See the  [blue post](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/overcrowded-realm-update/255835):
---
&gt; Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.
---
I switched at 45 from enha to ele. Questing seems 
---
much faster, you only need to drink every 5-6 mobs. I had full ravager agility set and enha felt so slow compared to ele, atleast the downtime without wf procs or parry/miss/dodge chaining.
---
On ele you just nuke adds before they can reach you. You can easily pull 2-3 mobs with CL, pop out fire nova, EB, CL again and finish off evading enemies 1 by 1.
---
I’m currently running with elemental mastery which allows me to vaporize targets every 3 minutes which is ridiculous. At lvl 50 I can burst for 4k ST, even more on 2-3mobs.
---
Still wondering if I should go NS build later to get those situational instant savers (heals/wolf/cl).
---
Only thing I don’t like is that now in dungeons I’m the healer and I have to fight for rolls with every clother.
---
if typing a couple of letters in a guild chat in an MMO triggers anxiety those people should probably be spending more time on their mental health than playing video games.

---
Oh, I guess I didn't see anything in the thread of you complaining. I'm not going to go digging either, no point. 
---
When it comes down to it, I don't think pvping anybody makes a person a dick, and there are circumstances where you think it *does* make them a dick. Clearly we disagree on that fine point. Not trying to make mental gymnastics, trying to understand your point of view, particularly why you play on a PVP server when you feel like it's full of *some* dicks.
---
neither is a hunter if they're playing properly lol.
---
But the stats aren't bad for a hunter forsure
---
Warriors feels very different, even just from vanilla to BC. Comparing Classic vs. Retail it almost feels like different classes.
---
I have played rogue since CBT and while our kit has changed, the rotation and pattern of ability usage has changed very little. Even my muscle memory for keybinds is the same. This is from a combat tree perspective, haven't touched subtlety it assassination in ages.
---
Classic rogue design feels more inline with what I expect from the archetype. Retail rogue feels like Bruce Wayne had a baby with a pirate-ninja. That is not a bad thing.
---
So let's see, the Fight Club discord, one of the most respected theorycrafting places for warriors, states the following:
---
"DO NOT LEVEL AS PROT. ARMS OR FURY IS SUFFICIENT TO TANK ANYTHING UNTIL YOU ENTER RAIDS" ...
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/F4aqlns.png](https://i.imgur.com/F4aqlns.png) 
---
But hey, I suppose all those players are getting hard carried as well. Same goes for APES, all their warriors should l2p and watch your YouTube channel (XD).
---
F for GPU
---
Ahh right, I totally agree with that. I've done 3 levels of felwood/un'goro myself. Going to do winter spring and plaguelands next. 
---
I didn't realize people actually thought the only way to level 50+ were to grind dungeons. Folks only do that because of all the BiS loot from them, not because there is not alternative.
---
I came from a MMA backround and was fighting professionally back in 05 when I started playing WoW. People would never believe me when I said I was a hardcore WoW player. I just used to look at them funny and make fun of them for not knowing what WoW was. Just completely flip it on them.
---
Yeah the red ones are Mithril, that’s where the money starts to come in. Before that are Iron trunks which are brown, and just not as good for loot
---
Well, technically based on STD.
---
I went on to suggest that if you were unhappy with moderation here, you could make your own sub and moderate it how you please. You decided to interpret that differently, to fit your narrative, before going to good old route of insulting someone before (allegedly) blocking them. /slowclap
---
310% actually
---
I think they're reasonable. That's my opinion though.
---
Damn, just makes me wish they would have positioned a bit better so their arms aren't sticking out of both ends.
---
fewer
---
That's a prime bind my dude if you leave x bound to sit you are missing out
---
Tested this on other absorbs mechanics like warlock shields and ice barriers. They work correct.
---
EverQuest is still very much around with its own progression style 'classic' servers. Latest ones released in March and I think the slower one just entered velious. I leveled up to 50 and did some raids a few months back and it was super fun and very satisfying.
---
See you do it like this!
---
Applying buffs cause threat. I'm not sure about seals specifically, but that seems normal to me.
---
Yeah, the joke is he didn't specify the 7 movies were supposed to have JT in the cast. 
---
This god awful joke is brought to you by your 3rd Grade English Teacher: "See, I told you writing in complete sentences made a difference"
---
I on the other hand can't wait for the ridiculous clown fiesta I'll get to put on at 40 in the Dreamweave + Red Mageweave set.
---
to the best i can tell the answer is no.
---
i duel my rogue friendly fairly often and hes able to break my barrier right away. tho he might just do really high pre crit dmg
---
Aye, she kens.
---
A 20% increase in damage is not worth literal days of time spent camping the spawn.
---
If you save mind blast you can get about 50% of the last hits.you go for in my experience
---
Thank you for the silver stranger!
---
Stock up now and sell when the market goes up. Lots of investment to be made right now

But there *are* summoning stones...

\- ty so much! i will let @eulix\_ know
---
I like the idea of a chat addon / LookingForGroup channel addon with a blacklist and/or a whitelist, taking what you said, you can have certain phrases that when used will censor them based on the configuration.
---
Having alerts when someones looking for exactly what you have or visa-versa is definitely a good idea, it's not too complicated either.
---
&gt;It can also include an option to squelch messages from particular  players for a period of time (e.g. "LF1M scholo tank" spammed every 10s  but the player is not a tank). 
---
This is a good idea, but there are challenges with this. There are a few LookingForGroup / general chat Addons already, but they don't filter the content well or mistakenly filter non-spam as spam.
---
If I do something like this it would definitely need to be well tested!
---
Just as allowed as they are on retail. No worries about it. 
---
Only becomes a problem once somebody sets up an alt or secondary account and runs a bot to automate all the auction actions.
---
I started out on an RPPVP server years ago, rolled a PVE server to join some friends this time around and it really feels like something is missing, the tension of having to worry about other players just adds such a level of depth to the game
---
Fear can be kicked if you don't get death coiled which is instant and then feared which is what any not crap lock will do. And in battlegrounds or PvP in generally your not fighting just one person it's extremely easy to be feared, charmed, seduced more then once in a fight.
---
Other rogues probably won't be a problem, since crippling would be removed by vanish anyway.  I suppose I might consider deadly poison if I knew I was going up against a dwarf rogue... but that seems a bit unlikely.
---
My issue with other rogues is bleeds, so I keep the luffa trinket around.  You probably don't worry about that so much.
---
One of the options you suggested is the clear best choice imo:
---
**Start knocking out your pre raid bis in BRD groups.**
---
Treat the xp as a bonus.
---
Ideally find a guild with a good number of level 50+ players so that you can mostly do guild runs so you aren't rolling on gear against new players each run. (not as big of a deal for healers anyways though)
---
Otherwise, if you only do quests you're gonna have to go back to BRD at 60 anyways. So why not go ahead and get the gear grind out of the way, at least crossing BRD off the list?
---
Thank you for your kind words friend!
---
Where do you download it? I've installed addons using twitch app? Cant find it on there
---
Yeah, I'm 60 and I still have 6 fuckin' quests in BRD I want to complete &gt;.&lt; No one wants to do regular ass quest runs/full clears anymore. It's all grind grind grind, xp-per-hour, spam partial runs til instance cooldown. It's really annoying and definitely making classic less fun for me personally. A bunch of tryhards that can't just play the fuckin' game, they gotta ruin it with overwhelming efficiency.
---
40 and 60 are the acceptable dinging levels, so say I.
---
Yes, but you were only able to farm honor reliably with BGs. I personally didn't even bother before that.
---
Lmao cool
---
The problem is the attacker in some cases has immunity, if u go to engage a lock or priest in that space they will fear u into the guards. This is definitely an exploit.
---
I think there is a incentive, but it's really down to the user. If someone is going for BiS they are logging on every day and pushing that grind anyway. I mentioned in another comment just now, when I played FFXIV I didn't log on to do dailies, in fact I hate dailies and generally dodge them in any game. Didn't matter, didn't need the gear from it and my guild wasn't anal about it and we still cleared current tier. 
---
It's a different in mindset of the player. If your maxing then sure you *have* to log on every day. And in classic they'll be logging on every day for 6+ hours to make sure they max everything, this is before we start talking about the Honor ranking system in classic which requires you to play most of the day every day for months.
---
Wand spec and spirit tap first. After that, you can do absolutely whatever and be fine. Many would also recommend imo shadow word pain, which I would do as well. Other then that... meh. Go willy nilly until you reach 40/45 and respec for shadowform.
---
Wait.you said you wouldn't go holy to level. So am I not using the first build in the link?
---
They *severely* limited what you could use it on, to the point where you could basically only use it on the ground to "charge" forward 15 yards.
---
I have very fond memories of doing rogue things with it; to sap unsuspecting alliance who planted felwort seeds, steal their felwort, then escaping into the big tree in Stormheim around the fertile soil with the grappling hook. The area was unreachable before flying came out and it was some of the most fun I've had as a rogue.
---
I accidentally tab targeted an Alliance Warrior in STV while killing the pirates. Once I dot'd him, it was over... he was coming after me and it was me or him. So I killed him. Did /sorry and went on killing pirates. Not long later he shows up with 2 friends and jumped me. I dot'd all 3. They got me, but I took 2 with me. But then they started ganking me on rez, so I got 2 friends to make it a fair fight. We killed each of them 3 times and were ready to move on. But they got 3 more to make it 6v3... and that's how the war started. I love WoW Classic. :D
---
You're not doing anything wrong, don't worry about it. It's not a bug your exploiting, it's done by tons of players, it's not hurting others.
---
Because he likes a video game? What’s all the hate on this guy...
---
Max I think 1 level or maybe 1.5 levels
---
To CompUSA
---
I mean in a dungeon. Sometimes i sheep a mob, and I just have the feeling it breaks after like 2 seconds even without it taking damage. But when I get sheeped by some mob, it’s for like a full minute. 
---
Don’t have an example tho. Hope you understand what I mean :p
---
Ok cool
---
Remulos oce :P
---
This explains my frustration at trying to kill priests...
---
At least I know it's not normal for the bubble to last that long now lol
---
Can confirm, I noticed something with crits not breaking my shield when i went to stranglethorn and the cats would take forever to break it despite their regular damage being enough to break it in a few seconds. I figured they just couldn't crit against shields and it was doing regular melee damage which was being reduced by inner fire armor. But this is WAY better!
---
This is exact same amount of wrong as nugenergy. If I wait 1 minute 30 seconds after throwing distract then the next time I throw distract the tick will happen almost exactly in the middle of the energy bar.
---
So it's consistently wrong through addons for me.
---
Second on EBB. 
---
You can even make multiple trackers so you can have 10 min+ buffs on a separate bar from short duration buffs...
---
You aren't funny or creative, get over it.

Skinner box is probably a misnomer, but you have the right idea with the behaviors giving our brains a little kick to keep them doing them. 
---
There is a boundary though, between fun because its enjoyable in multiple aspects and it becomes a pleasurable habit, and fun because it is designed to stimulate your brain into giving you a dopamine hit before anything else.
---
So twinking is purposefully leaving a character at a lower level and maxing out the gear for pvp, usually battlegrounds. Usually you stay at the top end of a level bracket, like 19 or 29, etc. 
---
You are probably talking about making an alt. And I personally wouldn't say warlock has a varied dps rotation at 60, it's practically one button (shadowbolt). Leveling is different, but you can't really make use of your dots in raids.
---
Plenty of people havent. Thank god your anecdotes are fallacious when it comes to objectivity.
---
No its 70% to avoid interrupts when casting heals. Smite and holy fire are not effected by it.
---
Even if you go holy its STILL not effective while levelling to be casting any heal once  mob is in melee range.
---
Hrmm, yes, I too think think stun locking everything before pvp trinkets exsist is the way to go! Good talk...
---
I wrote that before reading. Upon reading you need to be opening with cheapshot more. Ambush is good for ganking but any real fight you have already lost. 
---
For instance, a good mage would have barrier up. Again unless you are just ambushing him while hes drinking. He would just nova and blink then just kite you. 
---
Basically you should be using your combo points to stun, then after you kidney you can blind them and wait out the stun DR and restealth and repeat. Mages will iceblock the stuns so it gets tricky. You have to time your CDs accordingly. 
---
Warriors you can stun lock and kite with crippling poison. They are tough because if you use evasion you are kinda setting yourself up to get massively crit by over power. Again you have to stun and use sprint to help kite through hamstring.
---
I'm not going through all of them, especially not hunters :P, but the general idea is a stunned target cant attack you so you should use all your abilities to keep a target stunned or otherwise cced and then use prep and do it again!  Also using deadly poison is a no no. It will break your blinds and gouges. Crip and instant or mind numbing is the way to go. 
---
Again, ambush is great for ganking, but typically in a duel situation stunning is what you want to do.

Just because you enjoy a metaphorical golden shower from a product you are paying for doesn't mean the rest of us do.
---
Get over yourself we are allowed to complain about a shitty late stage capitalism company that is holding our favorite game hostage.
---
The inept fucks should have licensed it out to a competent group that was actually interested in it being successful. (4 pvp servers for NA LMAO)
---
If they are an active player like others said /who them if they made the character logged in once and haven't been back since your shit outta luck.
---
Respecting that content
---
Yes its fun, not everybody do the same activities for fun, thats human nature. Welcome to the world.
---
It's a fair point your making.
---
Amazing
---
This is strange because when I have a good tank I can go balls to the wall regardless, whereas when I get a mediocre tank everything turns to shit and it’s chaos.
---
Someone please please please make a better totem addons that the only one they have out right now, it's terrible.
---
You mean your ex-husband?
---
For you, yeah. But with a few mana users in the group, that number is cut down to quickly make it worthwhile.
---
Thank you! Also, username checks out lmao
---
wow, look at all those pixels! 10/10.
---
Because whatever they type will get translated into the weird language that is usually seen when horde/alliance try to talk to each other.  There’s probably a name for it but I’m a noob. 
---
So they get around it by spacing the letters out
---
Is move anything classic updated (downdated?)?  Or do you use the retail version?
---
There is no difference solo leveling Holy/disc and leveling shadow until low 40's.
---
People that plan to shadow usually respec  around 40 or shortly after.
---
I don't know what he used, but Ender 3 and Ender 5 are usual recommended "I don't mind doing a lot of fiddling to get the settings dailed in" printers and Prusa i3 is the usual recommended "I don't mind paying more, I just want it to work" printer.

my feelings exactly, the megaserver i was in didnt feel like the old world.

for some reason lol

Good ol' vanilla spell batching at work there.

Eh, not too concerned, i drift back and forth across games every couple months i'll return to it shortly.
---
You don't have to pay for anything.
---
Thank you so much
---
2 Weeks ago I saw a mage getting smashed by a rogue, i blinked and frost nova and engaged with the rogue and an enemy druid that also joined. And the mage i saved literally just blinked away and fucked off...
---
I killed both of them by getting lucky with crits and deleteing the druid but some people man...
---
Rank 10 is my goal too, still gonna be a bitch though.
---
You think they manually just go through a huge list of reports?  At the scale that they are receiving reports they most likely only deal with bugs that are reported multiple times.
---
Any troll village.
---
I juat love the soundtrack
---
I am going to assume around the same age, race and obviously all sound American. 
---
I am glad all my friends sound very different from each other
---
Even better when it's all enh, ele, feral, oomkin,  and 40 different hunters talking like they will be raiding the minute they hit 60
---
Maintenance dipshit
---
I'm not in any guild now but some guilds are big and so theres a lot of different conversations that I dont want to read.
---
He ain't gonna pull that shit again.
---
Yay for playing WoW with a controller! (It’s a steam controller, don’t knock it till you try it!)
---
I don't think you understand how software development and deployment happens.  I would imagine the more reports for a particular bug is a factor in determining the priority for a particular issue.  This is obviously a high priority issue, so it will take precedence over many other bugs that have been reported.
---
I just realized that everyone else auctioning on my server hates me
---
Yeah, the raiders will get bored after a few weeks of raidlogging MC and Ony. This is why I didn't rush to 60. 
---
I'd expect a resurgence once phase 2 starts, but that's not going to happen for a few months.
---
thank you for in depth reply :)
---
For any even semi-hardcore player it absolutely does.
---
It's a massive increase that will hold through every tier in PVE and it's huge in PvP.
---
HE'S NEVER NOTICED IT
---
Everyone I know has been doing BRD once they get 54+.
---
I got called edgy make yesterday. I kinda like it.
---
Your point being? Cause your guild member is correct. Talents and itemization were nothing like they are in Classic. The days where Arcane Explosion had a cast time, where Druids had a talent for hurricane and innervate, where spell damage gear virtually didn’t exist. When MC just launched it was WAY harder than it is now, because every class was much weaker.
---
So before you ridicule somebody you might want to check your facts.
---
What server is this cause I wanna go there
---
In BC You could play paladin as Horde and shaman as Alliance, maybe that is what got you confused :)
---
How can you fall from a flight path?
---
it has some good twink gear that can drop there, but that's not a given, I am not sure how many runs you would have to do to have a decent chance. 
---
If you are doing it at the minimum lvl required it won't be good gold/h anyway as it will be slow and challenging by definition (you being minimal lvl). 
---
if people farm low dungeons for gold, they usually do it at as high lvl as possible (60)  because you can power through it so much quicker at that lvl
---
God this reeks of gate keeping, yes literally just your opinion of how things should be handled is right and everyone else is a retail player if their idea is different. 
---
Fuck off.
---
That dude will frostshock SO HARD, dude.
---
If your healer likes you then you aren't Sweeping Strikes + Whirlwind tanking enough!
---
Same faction griefing is very different than opposing faction griefing, IMO. I think same faction griefing is FUCKED UP, and if you do that, fuck off.
---
Yo momma
---
Asking the real questions
---
Kill quest, sure.
---
Item drop quest, no fucking way.
---
Felpup doesn't ever eat it?  Succubus charm doesn't let them open with big nuke?(or mana drain prior to doing damage)
---
I can believe it, but it's not like they don't have options to get a non zero chance of winning, conditions depending.
---
They were available, but not available to both factions until BC with the introduction of blood elves and draeni
---
I'm already at this stage. Nearly hit 60 week 1 then slowed down once I hit 60 because I was playing too much. Now my guild is doing weekly raid and I've got some epics and almost all pre-bis for both tanking and dps (am warrior).
---
There's less incentive to rush now, which fits me fine. I'll skill mining/engineering, work towards epic mount, help friends and guildies and aim to have an alt 60 by phase 2.
---
Shared loot/less xp per kill/prefer playing solo/you probably smell :)
---
Update:  
---
Everyone saying it's my GPU; it generally stays around 60 C while gaming and that's basically average. Could be though, since I am playing on an older laptop while I build my new PC. Gotta fuel that classic WoW addiction even if it burns up my laptop LUL
---
MMO’s can attract people with pretty bad social skills.  Getting annoyed at people saying ding in your own guild is just kind of sad.
---
Lol you're a fucking piece of shit
---
If you're on the alliance I will find you!
---
This was posted 5x today...
---
Because fucking amateurs in their mothers basements in France were able to produce a higher quality recreation of Vanilla than the fucking billion dollar company that made the game in the first place.
---
Because it's not necessary for some classes.
---
What's a totem addon? I googled it but I'm still not sure (I might not have enough WoW knowledge to know what a totem is).
---
How would you improve the current one(s)?
---
It has a very common model, you wouldn't know it was it.
---
One of the newest versions of Details for classic already has the plugin installed called “tiny threat.” That is the threat meter. Just make sure to load the plugin. Doesn’t ClassThreatMeter only work for people who have the addon downloaded though?
---
Great post!
---
DW seems to be almost redundant during phase 1, unless you're trying to speed run. But even then, a lot of the pieces just aren't out yet.
---
I wouldn't say there's only one fury tank build. For example: you could go for imp HS instead of imp sunder armor.
---
Never apologize for being a Tauren!
---
Having farmed them both ways, I'd say its still better to aoe 3-5 of them. Anymore, and yeah you can potentially get deleted before even moving out of range of them post-nova.
---
The air elementals...that's honestly a toss up. I did it both ways, and the AoE method *did* end up being more kills per hour, but they were significantly more sketchy that way.
---
You're shitty then. Just because you can use something doesnt mean you should need it just in case. You dont need 3 types of gear to be good while leveling. 
---
As warrior I have passed on some ranged weapons because the hunter actually needed it and for me it was just 3 agi.
---
admitted ?
---
admits ??
---
Ofc Warriors are better. Who ever said Druid tank is better ?
---
Wait what there’s a specific reddit for memes and yet they allow them on here?
---
that poor shaman man, and you wonder why he attacked? Because you evil bastards do this to us!
---
[YOU DIDN'T THANK HIM FOR HIS SERVICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPquarz16wQ)

Serious?
---
2005 was when the market started to suddenly churn out MMOs non stop.
---
&gt; When you sit down you take only crits
---
That's just plain wrong. A crit can also be a crushing blow.
---
I don't need a second wife but I feel like someone should take you in. You don't need to be in that sort of environment.
---
Also what server/faction are you on? My wife and I play together and more couples to join in would be cool.
---
Also if anyone else is seeing this and wants to bring their partner to play in a group with another couple we are Horde on Kromcrush. I am Gator (Orc Warrior) if you want to message me.
---
I'm not saying that blizzard has a gun to whitekidneys head telling him to shut down the server, but they know damn well that any pserver dies when they release classic.
---
&gt; If you are looking at thousands of lines of code are you going to be able to look at a specific line and just be like, “Ah no no that’s going to interfere with this other snippet of code 2,800 lines down.” 
---
This is not what I'm talking about. They have a literal running version of 1.12, that they can use to test anything with.  Pservers had to rely on video, forum posts and rumors.
---
Are you on sulfuras? I had a 41  hunter roll on fleshhide shoulders and then leather shoulders of the monkey (in that order). He rolled on the second set because it had one more agility than the rare ones. Keep in mind he's in mail territory and there were two rogues in the group.
---
Human mage of course
---
As an officer, I kick anyone who says "ding" before level 60. Nothing more annoying than people spamming "ding" because they hit level 9
---
OMG! This just reminded me of how I used to copy / paste entire pages from lord of the rings books and send them to random players. 
---
I completely forgot about that.  This guy had much stronger effort.
---
And now you know why we quit after Vanilla.
---
*Laughs in purge*
---
Man that is a pretty huge oversight tbh
---
This is a broad overview, and I am *not* extremely qualified to be making this post. I'm just a layman who's been around long enough and read enough to understand it. Sorta. Hopefully someone else will come along and correct me if I get anything wrong. I want to note that when talking about scaling and theoretical damage numbers and such, people are generally referring to end-game raids where you'll be fighting raid bosses.
---
**tl;dr: warriors and their rage mechanic are partly balanced around their 5-19% chance to miss, and end-game gear allows them to bypass these restrictions. rage generation also ramps up dramatically with high-end gear, allowing warriors to do more than right click for 5-10 seconds waiting for enough rage to use their abilities**
---
Scaling in this context refers to the way armor, weapons, buffs, etc. ("power-ups" of any kind) affect damage and/or healing output. In other words, scaling can be expressed as the amount of extra damage you can do as your gear improves. For warriors, their base damage is very low (autoattack only, with occasional ability usage as rage permits). A naked warrior, level 60 with nothing but a white weapon, will do almost zero damage. A level 40 could probably kill him. A naked hunter, on the other hand, will still do pretty big damage. Not nearly as much as in their full kit, but enough to kill monsters or fight a level 40. However, if you give the warrior gear with increased chance to hit, increased chance to crit, and a lot of strength, he will start hitting like a truck. The hunter in his full kit will hit hard too, but his power doesn't increase as much as the warrior's. Why is this?
---
There's a couple of factors at play here. One of the major ones is the way that rage works. Because warriors are the only class who use this resource system, they scale in different ways to classes who use mana or energy. Rage is used for all warrior abilities, and an inability to generate rage means an inability to do more than autoattack. Rage generation is determined by an algorithm that takes into account various factors: whether you hit, how hard you hit, whether you crit, how much damage you're taking, etc. If warriors don't hit, they gain **0** rage. This is one thing holding down warriors at early levels. It reduces rage generation by about 15% (estimated - assuming 5% chance to miss, 5% chance for enemy to parry, 5% chance the enemy dodges). If a warrior is dual-wielding (which they will be in endgame content, as dual-wielding is superior for damage), this chance to miss goes up to 19%. This changes at endgame. Warriors will be decking themselves out in gear that gives them an increased chance to hit. That alone can increases their rage generation by ≥17%, since you have I believe an innate 2% chance to miss. In endgame content, melée classes like warrior and rogue typically want to be faced to the boss's back - this eliminates the enemy's ability to block or parry. This can account for another 5% or so increased rage generation that is unique to melée classes, but disproportionately benefits warriors. Another facet of rage generation is the way crits are handled. I'm not sure on the number, but crits generate extra rage. Warriors always generate extra rage when they hit hard (upgrading to a weapon with more damage directly increases the amount gained per hit), so it may be a function of that, but either way more crits = more rage = more ability spam.
---
One other factor that affects warriors' ability to "hyperscale" is that their damage is based directly off of the weapon in their hands. This applies to rogues, hunters, and enhancement shamans as well, but for mages, warlocks, cat druids, etc., damage is based on other factors. Casters like mages have "base damage" numbers listed on their spell, and those numbers stay the same regardless of the damage numbers on your staff. Druids go off of attack power calculations or something like that. Melée classes directly benefit from higher weapon damage, whereas only the stats attached to the weapons matter to other classes. There are some very high damage weapons in raids, and they continue to do more and more damage as you progress in raids. This allows warriors to not only crank out bigger autoattacks, but also to generate more rage which leads to using more abilities. 
---
Their talents are also arranged in a way that multiplies their effectiveness. Fury warriors specialize in hitting hard and fast with two weapons, and the entire tree is about making an innate ability stronger. For other classes like druids and shamans, they have to progress deep into a tree (feral/enhancement) to gain abilities that warriors get earlier and easier. These factors combined allow warriors to dominate the damage meters. As the game goes on, they simply get stronger and stronger. I apologise for writing a freakin textbook, but I got carried away. I'm sure I'm missing some glaring factors that make warriors so strong, but I can't think of them now.
---
thank god cuz it feels fucking terrible atm
---
this morning in a 1v1 vs a horde I FD'd one of their cast and then it basicly froze my animations for the rest of the fight.  I was like frozen in place and almost lost the 1v1 because of it and I'm pretty sure I clipped a few auto attacks because I rely on the combination of sound/sight &amp; a swing timer to properly weave my auto shots
---
If i had died i was going to make an alt right then and there lol
---
I guess it doesnt have a flight path, but i remember first walking into razor hill seeing the burrows and barracks and recognicing them from warcraft 3. It was so cool being able to to walk into them and talk to the people inside.
---
I'm way back on a 28 hunter and 24 priest (and a smattering of under 10s).
---
If I get one to 60 by Christmas, I'll consider it a success.
---
My dear friend i have noticed that when i try to use any of the minimap variant, it did not work so i found that the folder name for the variant is Minimapframe not minimap like the original one , and when i changed it worked so fine.
---
And if you can alter the original gryphon to be more like the elite runed frames with golden wings or tail or something like that.
---
That will be spectacular.
---
Lol you’re the snowflake here

---
Im a tailor, do i get all the mageweave that drops?
---
Mooncloth bag, robes of arcana, are probably the 2 best moneymaking ones early. Honestly tho most of the money you make as a tailor is gonna come from your mooncloth cd unless you get a pattern for an epic BoE item like gloves of spell mastery or something
---
Different mentalities I guess. I like min maxing so I'll wear whatever does the most damage or healing
---
Yet everybodies sketch-work of their undead warrior killing shit is here just fine. And I've seen better artistic work in a toilet. They aren't even funny... "ohh go kill murlocs heres my shitty pencil drawing i did lol!" 1,000,000 upvotes, and an emmy nominee.
---
Have you played blasted lands? They are 50 to 56 I think, but at least some quests.
---
why'd you make this shit racist?!?!

Your PC is fine, I too thought I had entered the matrix.

Graveyard camping is absolutely against TOS as it negatively impacts the gameplay of all players at that graveyard. This has always been the case.
---
&gt;Well, first of all, you don't need to do this.
---
Yes you do. At least if your goal is to not be a horrendously terrible PvPer.
---
Except JT wasn't in reservoir dogs.  So it fails the first part of the sentence
---
That's weak theory crafting. If you're talking about a pre-made situation (where fear will be dispelled by your healer) stuns get more common, not fears. And warlocks don't use succubus in high level pvp, so it's confusing why you bring that up.
---
here we go again, bois!
---
Sorry, seen way, way to many false claims on /r/wow right after a ban wave where folks claim to have been mysteriously banned for "no reason". I will always assume we aren't getting the whole story because that has been the case in a large majority of cases.
---
STV is case and point, better to go there after 35 then at 30, green mobs and yellow mobs below you have an increased chance to be hit and less recovery between them
---
What’s the second best pet and is he hard to get?
---
So that is a HUGE GAME BREAKING BUG for you? Which probably don't work in every situation possible since I'm sure mobs have critted through my shield, no idea what 400 Ms you're talking about and I'm not sure also what's wrong with warlock pets? Mine seems fine
---
Hmm, punting gnomes, funny indeed. (giggles)
---
But sometimes I also see even some alliance guys don’t like gnomes and say that they are alliance version of undead. Aren’t they “alliance trolls” as in they lost their home?
---
what episode is this
---
&gt;Note that I'm talking about stuff like WC, SM, etc.
---
Literally the first line in the OP.
---
I think you need some gear by Ragnaros/vael. Everything else can be overcome by knowing the mechanics and playing your role.
---
It falls to the census of the group,   Plane and simple.    I play with friends,   RL+old school guildies from 15+ years ago.    Gear goes to whom ever needs it the most.    No drama,  no problem.    Furthermore there is no set etiquette in a MMO.

I was in a  guild with a bunch of wackos once.  they made all kinds or ranks and you were required to salute higher ranks etc..    was fun for an afternoon, but those things never survive long

Right pservers had shields that never broke and backstabs that never critted my bad
---
&gt; As such, Classic launched with well over 6 million players, worldwide, and the vast majority of them are NOT from Retail, but returning players.
---
I'm one of them.  Until classic I last played in 2011.
---
I played retail for the weekend before classic with a buddy, just to level characters.  It was not the game I remembered and loved.

Classic is.

The version I got from Twitch does.  I can't remember the exact name of it.  There is a menu in the window header for the Details that lets you change it to a threat meter.  I'll try to remember to look at it tonight.
---
happens if you only give useless streamers beta access to promote the game instead of  testing it.
---
Arcane Int is mandatory for all casters.
---
Portals. Food. Water. Much better Crowd Control.
---
At best Locks tie in utility, and that's being generous to Warlocks.
---
Mages do all of this while having absolutely zero weaknesses.
---
I mean you're right but it doesn't matter because for this bug as soon as it's a crit no damage is taken, regardless of the fact if it's crushing or not.
---
I’ll bite. To bring a new life into the world.
---
I do it too sometimes, get around 40ms ping and data usage is pretty low!
---
Just putting that out there for context, for anyone thinking of MTing as a Druid. One of the best tanking players in Classic/Vanilla advocates for War over Druid, even though he plays both effectively.
---
The worse the player, in relation to Skarms skill, the bigger the disparity will likely be between those two classes.
---
So unless you're an amazing player, avoid trying to MT as a druid.
---
Is it that big of a deal to admit what said was not as clear as you intended? If it is then just move on instead of trying to convince people you were right.
---
Maybe I'm a shitty tank.  IDK.  But I've run so many instance groups and never have I ever had a healer or even any other group member want to run again.
---
I do my best to hold aggro of every mob, even when extras are pulled from a runner.

I use my bow to pull single mobs or groups  when there is a possibility of aggroing an entire room.
---
If I see a mob going after the healer, or anyone else for that matter I run over and pull them off.   In my mind I want to be the only person in the group taking damage.  If any other player is taking damage it means I am failing at my job, regardless if it's their fault or not.
---
I mark mobs constantly with Skull, X, Square, Moon (seems to be the preferred order).  As the mobs are killed and we rotate through them I mark the current target with skull.  (these are all setup as a macro so it's only a button press)
---
I give casters and especially the healer plenty of time to drink if their mana is low.
---
So tell me,   What do people see in certain tanks that makes them go, "Yea this guys knows what he's doing and I'd be happy to do more with him."?
---
Or the druids. We all know those hippies love their shrooms 🤔
---
The problem is that everyone else could the same.
---
This might be a stupid question but...
---
I lunch classic wow from the Blizzard Battle Net launcher, I click play and it log me into the server and everything.
---
Sometimes I go AFK and it logs me out dropping me back into the Login screen.
---
How do I know what credentials I use to log in with?
---
Why is this flared as humor?
---
Kluss, look it up. MCP &amp; powershifting allows us to top the meters, so what matters is how much you want to farm.
---
The fuck? Without layering there would be how ever many layers worth of people trying to camp the mob on a single layer.
---
If you have 5 hunters on 5 layers that's 1/5 shot. No layers, all 25 people are trying to tag the same spawn. 
---
I get that the timer thing is an added variable,  layering is a push at best but getting rid of them with the current pop loads won't make anything easier.
---
Found the guy in video.
---
There is literally a sounds and animation that happens when it procs.
---
Warlocks are probably better at hunting rogues and also solo them quite easily.

Start getting your pre raid bis items it will get you too 60 while doing it :)
---
yes, there is a setting to set it to under cut by a fixed amount instead of a percentage, just set that fixed amount at 1c
---
They were harder. But thats because most people didn't insist on optimizing groups like they do today. Guilds were much more likely to bring non-ideal specs, classes, and people without Bis pre raid gear. 
---
Play with a guild thay doesn't follow or require that stuff and the content will be difficult once again. However for some people, the challenge is in making the raid is easy as possible through min-maxing and optimizing groups.
---
Martyrdom doesn't seem to proc with PW:S up either. Might be mistaken but I've been watching for it in PvE
---
Yeah, it's an implied agreement not to fight
---
Like others are saying you want to time your cast so you're maximizing your 5 second rule on regen. I wouldn't recast it while you're fighting a mob though. You want to cast it so it's as 'free' as possible since you'll regen the mana back before needing it.
---
Thats like, you're opinion man.
---
I’ve never leveled as feral before and I’m having a surprising amount of fun. I never was big on melee dps. The only issue I have is that things die too quickly for my Rip to be of any use, and I haven’t unlocked Ferocious Bite yet.
---
I mouse turn, still can’t FD consistently.  I also macro pet passive and pet follow to FD with no benefit.  Stars have to align to FD in PvP.    Sometimes the animation doesn’t even go off...
---
Clearly Nola’s. It made it to the water!
---
Unless they've come out and explicitly said otherwise, I'm thinking the devs always *intended* for warriors and paladins to wear plate. Not sure why the door was left open for the other armor classes. I mean just read the official description of Paladins https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/classes/paladin
---
Maybe it's a bit of RP in me that I feel the need to work within that? I'm not knocking anyone else for wanting to be a Clothadin or Leatharrior.
---
What "genre" is it supposed to belong to?

Fix it blizz!!

Wait till what you want is in the game before you start playing it seems like it would have been the best option for you...

Imagine being so lazy that reading one word irritates you, or thinking that typing something for 1/4 of a second is too much.
---
That guy is weird im not sure why hes so critical of ur anecdote lmao
---
as a priest.... leave us alone :)
---
I didn't think vanilla raids are hard enough to warrant the highest DPS classes as long as you do the mechanics? Or is that not the case for later raids
---
Wait, but you need to be in melee range to hit the mobs?
---
Level 48 enh shaman. Been using 2H+WF for leveling. Should I switch to dagger + shield? Heard it's more consistent for grinding. Not a fan of the inconsistency of 2H WF.

Meant pulp fiction. What you get when you're posting between panels at a conference.

This is actually 5 people corpse camping. How dull does your life have to be wth

This^ 
---
It’s mostly the mana thing. Warriors really either forgot or never really knew how important the priests mana bar is for surviving a fight. It’s probably the second or first priority aside from maybe holding aggro. 
---
I see a LOT of leeroys, that get pissed when I’m OOM and they just pulled another pack and suddenly the heals stopped. They look at chat too late and by that time, some resentment has set in.
---
I think I remember seeing this on a show on G4 back in the day. XPLAY maybe?

Congrats!  Side note: All this desire for Broken Tooth!  I mean, sure, dat 1.0 is caster's bane for PvP, but where's the love for the sweet, sweet [Ghost](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=3619/ghost-saber) [Saber](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/look.php?id=tigerskinsnow-transparent)?!

SM is our instance in our zone, do you expect it to not be full of Horde players waiting to get groups going.
---
At midnight or after people are often in zombie mode, it's a sucky time to try to process surprise drama.
---
Thank you! It's nice to see a good mage say this. Please represent for your class. So many mages who think they are "being optimal and speeding the run up", but are really fucking over their healer and tank because they aren't as good as they think they are.
---
Oh yeah, it's all coming together
---
Am I misremembering the strat for this boss? I thought you pull one around a corner one at a time? Why does this even matter if a kick is doubled.
---
How did you fall?
---
The absolute best place is moonglade. Fished up well over 60 around a hour and a bit
---
It's important to bear in mind with Hillsbrad that the level range isn't the same for both factions. I think Horde generally go there a few levels earlier than the Alliance, just because of when quests come up that tell you "Go to Tarren Mill / Southshore now". This kind of has a long term effect of people getting in fights with a level disparity, and making a note to come back later to help their faction level a little easier. The step after is other high levels getting called to fight against whoever is running around on a mount, and now it's essentially an eternal rolling battle. This is without even considering that there's no flight point in Alterac, so you'll have Alliance people running from Southshore right through the middle of Hillsbrad for quests there, and it's also the main route to get to Scarlet Monastery for Alliance if you don't want to / can't run through Western Plaguelands.
---
Sometimes its definitely imbalanced just by nature of who happens to be around, but I honestly kind of think this stuff is at the heart of what makes zones like Hillsbrad have such a rep and a bit of longevity outside of just doing the quests.
---
And on the note of lvl 60's having nothing better to do... you're kind of right! Enjoy the journey, not the destination, because at 60 Classic isn't exactly overflowing with things to do at any given moment, and that's true for all of us! :)
---
Welp this is it boys. Get your torches and pitchforks. Fuck this 4th riech shit.
---
Newbie warrior here. From the guides i got the idea the 2-hand axes are best. But what about tanking? If I go with arms spec should I get 2 weapon sets: 1 with two-handed axe and 2 with shield ans one-handed smthg?
---
Alright, I'll give that a go, thanks!
---
So everyone talks about this kid going to prison for 5 or 10 years, or more....

but in much of Europe you can rape a kid and get like, 5 years, and if youre Muslim, you get basically no time behind bars at all. 
---
Is it really fair that denying a service for an hours has between 5-100x the punishment of one of the worst felonies imaginable?
---
I wouldn't really "plan" to go elemental for leveling, not that you can't or shouldn't - but it is a very gear dependent build, and good gear with caster stats on mail will take you some time to put together (you can't just wear trash leather and cloth like you can for healing, unless you ONLY want to level in dungeons). IF you get the gear together, go ahead and swap over!
---
You're not going to have the luxury of being too picky about gear, so honestly just take the bigger numbers IMO :P. Flametongue Weapon scales with spell damage, but not in a very effective way (e.g. still better to use rockbiter or windfury). Shields have pretty generous stats on them and I think it's likely you will want to rock dagger and shield but if you get a great staff, go ahead and use it, they will basically be interchangeable for your build. 
---
[here's a pretty basic elemental build that is good for pvp and pve, but not raids (so 5-mans)](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/550301550000151--50034300005). I'm not sure what the definitive 31/0/20 build is, but mine is close and I stand by my choices. Potential changes: I think the +range talents for any class are quite niche, as they mostly are just for PVP, and even then, only make a difference with other classes that are at the same base range as you spells, and only those who do (or don't) have ranks in +range talents. If arenas come out, you might decide you want range for specific matchups, but I personally am not a huge fan (but conventional wisdom is that they are pretty good). You aren't the main healer, so half a second off the cast time is hgie (especially in PvP) compared to getting 5% off the couple of heals you throw out. +Spell hit is amazing and they hid it from you in resto so you snatch that up, and your spell crit will likely be acceptable, so we take that extra little bump to your heals after a crit. totems cost 20% less mana is good, pretty self explanatory, it's not amazing but it is good. And tidal mastery finishes you out with 5 points into a totally solid talent.
---
It's an insult if you don't.
---
Blizzard broke the census app but according to the last snapshot on wowpop.appspot.com, Skeram had 20k alliance players, 7k Earthfury, and 20k heartseeker. Horde pop was vastly more on Skeram at 30k, 10k Earthfury, and about 8-9k on heartseeker. Coming from Skeram, therefore heartseeker seems the best choice.
---
Lol well many of us disagree with you and are happy bliz is using this release schedule.
---
Don’t use pawn. There are bis lists all over the place. Anything that is similarly stat’d can be boiled down to preference (ex: one item has less spell dmg but more intellect than another). Just use a bit of good judgement and you’ll be fine.
---
When I hit 55 I'm just gonna take a break for a week or so and level up my alt I've been waiting to work on. Come back to 2 levels of rested XP, then maybe do it again.
---
Disagree. Hunters have flare and tracking abilities that allow them to get the jump on rogues, as opposed to having to wait for the rogue to open up and then countering them.
---
If your post is an honest representation of Alliance then you are all idiots that deserve to be culled.
---
That's why so many of us canceled and only resubbed to play Classic, right?  See how you're confused for nothing?
---
A lvl 34 shaman duel me on the zeplin, im a lvl 30 priest. He /rude me and i accept. Mc him off the flying boat.
---
You're logic is sound, however if I count up the times I've used HS and Sunder respectively in a bossfight HS more often wins. This means I saved  more rage from speccing imp HS.
---
Hunters have track hidden, hunters mark, speed with cheetah, concussive shot, FD+trap, pet attack. Don’t get me wrong warlocks are tanky and do well haunts rogues but if we’re talking “hunt down”
---
that wasn't me that said that qtpie. try again.

This isnt Thrall, Thrall is fatter

Id rather see him being tamed infront of me 1000 times than never see him at all like now. Besides, one trip there at 5:00 AM and after a couple of times he would be yours.

Why do we have to have genders...   geeze..   LOL, J/K

I WAS WONDERING WHY THE FUCK PRIESTS WERE INVINCIBLE HOLY FUCK

Or at least not help the tank kill the boss until getting that guy back in.
---
Oily blackmout, stonescale eels, nightfin, and deviate fish are all high ticket items. Also make sure you level your cooking; you can get 2-3x gold off those cheap fish by listing on the AH. Vendor prices on food are expensive, and resourceful hunters will gladly buy cheap AH food (that still sells well above raw fish vendor price). Not very effective to farm though, just good while leveling.
---
Wand Spec, Spirit Tap, and spirit gear is all you need. Do whatever you like with everything else. 
---
You can respec at 40+ to get Shadowform if you want.
---
You had me excited till you said Horde.
---
We could have coupled-up together but the wife and I are Alliance on Kromcrush...
---
Griefing breeds griefers.  Really nothing to apologize for or explain.  I just always accept that if I grief I have no right to get pissed when someone does the same to me.  It's a good system.
---
What's a rare mechastrider, if you don't mind me asking?
---
A lot of alliance consider transferring or quitting due to the imbalance. You always have to fight outnumbered.
---
So when we get the opportunity to grief a horde and make them potentially quit, it's for the health of the server in the long term
---
My orc ran into a female dwarf warrior wearing some kind of scantily clad plate armor, and I have to admit I was turned on.
---
So much great caster loot in there, is partially why.
---
Don't undercut, just undercut the bid price and leave the buyout price the same. You'll show up first in the list and everyone makes the same amount of money. At least that's how it used to be. I have noticed some funky stuff going on with the AH sorting so far.
---
You act like its quantum physics. Instead of being smug you could just explain it.
---
I don’t mind the mindset, it just feels like 8/10 players (at least on this forum) only care about min.maxxing over anything else..
---
I swear people used to enjoy the character-building a lot more then people do nowadays.
---
One thing people like is someone who pulls quickly and knows what the group can handle.
---
That doesn't necessarily mean pulling too much, but simply paying attention to your groups mana &amp; capabilities. If we're done with a pull and the healer is at no mana I'll usually wait until they've drunk for about 10 seconds, pull, and in the time the mobs reach you and you've dipped low enough they'll have finished. This can be slightly more time efficient than waiting for them to be completely ready.
---
Alternatively you might be in a group where the healer is usually high on mana but the other casters aren't. You're likely to have a rogue, hunter, warrior, or maybe shaman with you who are less reliant on mana so if 2 casters are drinking, the healer is good on mana, and you have another DPS with you you can pull a smaller group while they regenerate.
---
Another way to consistently keep pulling is utilizing bloodrage effectively. What I usually do is use the minimum amount of rage I need to hold threat and changing how much I use depending on whether or not my taunt is up. Then in between pulls using bloodrage to keep myself in combat while the healer drinks a bit and maintaining a kind of rage pool so I can grab aggro quickly on the next group, sometimes though this just isn't possible.
---
That said, you can do literally everything right and people might not be keen on inviting you for a million possible reasons. And sometimes all it takes is one good and fun run and a person will love you forever, it's kind of a crapshoot
---
It is
---
Maybe he felt empathy for the Starving Mountain Lion I was killing.  Was pretty funny since I just had a emote party with a bunch of other alliance guys.
---
Yep, totally agree. 
---
“Can I roll into Nesingwary camp without the 5 Alliance standing there lighting me up? Let’s find out.”
---
It does help that the graveyard is super close to the camp though haha.
---
Your face sucks
---
I'm pretty sure they even acknowledged that line with the teaser announcement with Chromi.
---
UD Rogue, For the Horde!
---
I do hope you are a troll or indeed young, otherwise I suggest a real evaluation of your attitude towards other and yourself. Quite embarrassing.
---
I actually think Classic has a lot of replay-ability. Just look at all the private server players who have rolled on every new server for years. You can roll a different class or on the other faction. Playing a different class is like a new game. I feel it has potential as a seasonal game like Path of Exile or D3.
---
I've been playing Hunter for a long, long time so yeah I know how to do it. It isn't working. That's great it's working for you, but idk what to say -- there's a huge amount of reputable Hunters saying it's broken. Clearly it's an issue.
---
Fairbanks?
---
That video gave me a new appreciation for him, I actually want to give his stream a try now.
---
This isn't r/wowcirclejerk I think I'm lost.

lmao did that in vanilla when someone tried to duel me on zep. Declined. They say "pussy". Accepted. Bye.
---
Classic move
---
If I'm understanding you correctly, it does exist. 
---
Like a UI to target the Skulled, 'squared' etc targets.
---
I am not sure about the threat meter or pull timer. Do you mean how long ago the target was pulled?
---
Well it was first weeks of wow, in leveling phase. There were no friends at those levels, rarely anyone was higher than 40 actually. And we didnt know that you could go for other healers
---
Well I have an appointment to gank allies on Hillsbrad on level 60 because even when vastly outnumbered we never killed them but it was a guarantee than groups of 2+ and/or when they heavily outleveled a horde they would attack you when alone.
---
We can call it, World PVP?
---
World PvP nosedives the second battlegrounds come out. People will still kill each other if they are farming the mobs they need but the giant battles in South shore basically end as soon as Bgs start.
---
I definitely feel this.  I quit in like 2009, and I haven't been able to convince any of my old WoW buddies to start again.
---
A few people I used to play with in my hometown are back, but they rolled characters early on a server that's now full (and PvP - not really my style).
---
crazy to get that much time when you can just go rape a kid or kill someone and get the same or less time... or no time at all if youre a Muslim/illegal alien (especially in Europe) 
---
we really protect the corporate interests
---
Sure, what's best for a specific raid team can't be as binary as "20 mages for dps."
---
4 is right out!
---
"wow a purple thats lit"
---
Didn't they normalize pet attack at a certain point? Will the next phase do that?
---
Is this all for naught?
---
Max level dungeons with greens will get you by, but you'll need to drink more often. 
---
Gear becomes more important when raiding.
---
Nothing dude said was "slamming people down" and you're being crazy oversensitive. A cautionary word, warning people to not jump the gun, isn't predicting that the game will fail. It's just saying "yeah this is dope but give it a few months before you make sweeping proclamations."
---
you're an idiot. Overfeeding isn't animal abuse -\_- if you're force feeding the cat, for sure, but if you're just making sure your pet has plenty of food and water available to him or her, that IS NOT abuse. That's taking proper care of your pet. Just because the cat decides to overeat, does not make you an abusive owner -\_-  That's like calling a parent abusive because their child decides they want to go to the fridge and overeat. It makes zero sense, those are the childs choices, NOT the parents.  
---
Cut out the whiteknight bullshit you damn troll.
---
It's just part of the game, part of creating your own adventure that people liked about classic.
---
Yeah the 400ms delay is really awful, hope a small indie company like Blizz is able to reduce it like the very resourceful private servers did.
---
Pets + fd bugs really are awful, enough for me to not level a hunter for gold making until that shit is fixed.
---
patched 3 hours ago
---
Take your time. Some of the quests are not your regular go-here-kill-these. They are fun to read.
---
LOL no it's not. It's some hype man bullshit.
---
you need to use a free action pot or you take too much damage in the stun
---
Again if you dont have the baseline to compare it to you wont understand. 
---
The internet is much better these days but blizzard has kept systems in place to "compensate for lag" which ends up adding artificial lag to the game for no reason at all.
---
I have no plans of raiding...plus with phase 2 or 3 comes the pvp vendors as welll
---
I doubt it's a full on decline. Part of it is burn out (people will be taking breaks), part is realm transfers (lots going on ATM), part is people getting back to school (depending on when you play lots of kids, and collage students are busy with school), and the last part is the population balancing out level wise. The lower level zones have abit less people, the mid level zones are packed, and the top end zones are still empty.
---
Even if you get Bloodsail exalted (which I did back in the day - three times), there's an end to the grind. Eventually, you get that rep, you get the item, you have everything BiS and at 60. There is no end to retail with titanforging.
---
Correct
---
Isn't the extra range cancelled out by them being closer to you because of the hitbox?  Like, essentially you're a step or so forward in terms of combat, so you don't really get an edge.  I think thats how it works.
---
Hemo’s fine until debuff slots become a limited resource
---
it's not a shooter the core mechanic is building and building is the only reason the game is so good.  building doesn't diminish core fps mechanics it enhances them and makes them WAY more dynamic
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusCrowdedCheddarBudBlast
---
This is what high level fortnite looks like it's tight dynamic angles created by building.  his opponent demolishes him with superior angles by outbuilding and outpositioning him for 90% of the fight.

A person in your GUILD is sharing a, although small, accomplishment and you see that as desperate for attention? Bruh

Of course he does. Only has 2g.
---
The monster math?
---
Exploiting an unintended bug, yes
---
I totally agree with you people that want the pure classic experience are just ruining it for everyone else. The game lacked back in the day and it's kind of dumb that they're not fixing mistakes that they fixed later on and future expansions.
---
I used to play with someone who automated the gz thing based on keywords like, ding, leveled, etc
---
Let's be honest leveling is not tough. It's time consuming. And if you are leveling with at least one other person it's trivial.
---
The point of moderation is to make these judgement calls, it's always going to be a bit arbitrary and subjective, that's how humans work. The only people who lose here are people making mediocre memes from templates. Getting seen by a handful of people and clogging up frontpage even after being removed is still plenty of time and exposure befitting low effort meme content.

i heard blizzard is saving all major bugs fixes for the next 2.0 patch release

You’re an idiot. Being a dick should not be a crime.

He disabled your game for a few hours.

You are insane to equivocate DDOS’ing a game server with DDOS’ing “one of your systems”.
---
They are NOT the same.
---
What skill lvl do you need to fish there?
---
I leveled a Mage during Vanilla. Then a Lock for BC. I used to stomp druids, especially kitties. Lock was boring and I wanted a challenge so I rolled Feral thinking it must be garbo. And it was only then that I found out druids also get track humans. If I got jumped at low HP by someone of similar level I would stalk them, wait in the shadows, and kill them when it was opportune. They would rez behind a tree thinking I couldn't see them, but like you, I could see them on my minimap. I figured out the way of the claw and used to wreck havok. The best was when they would call in help but I could see them on the minimap waiting in a building nearby or something. I would go look and it would be a high level, but they would have their low level friend targeted so I would watch and wait, then pounce once their friend ported away.
---
So tldr: Track Humans is fun 😁
---
I posted a vid in another post, that'll I'll share here too  [https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileBrightInternNomNom](https://clips.twitch.tv/AgileBrightInternNomNom). I also forgot to mention in my first comment that you should wait for Serpent Sting to fall off your target or dont use it til after you FD because that dot dmg will either negate you from leaving combat, put in you back combat immediately, or briefly let u outta combat before putting u back in combat.
---
Game isnt balanced 1v1
---
blizz made a bluepost that they're working on fixes though to some bugs relating to feign death.
---
yesterday someone was bragging about 250 tailoring in gc
---
Mum said it was turn to post fake conversation for karma :(((
---
I would kill to have a healer that knows when to drink. Can't tell you how many times I've sat and waited for them to start because they're completely OoM then I just watch their mana slowly start ticking back up and someone pulls because I'm going too slow. As if I want to sit there and waste all my precious rage.

29 I saw a lot of sham twinks but wf is 30 so I would think 39 is good too
---
Worse for the druid, better for him.
---
The druid would replace the gear in a few levels also.
---
I only help if I see someone being 2v1'ed.
---
If two people are battling it out, I won't interfere. I'd be pissed if I was having a 1v1 with someone and they suddenly get healed or received any other kind of help.
---
And warlocks infernals not working properly.
---
Be wary when buying your skills, a lot of them is not worth getting while leveling up
---
Yes, so as I thought, you're talking from a retail/Pserver perspective : 
---
&gt; Not sure how its fair to give out gear to players who lose every pvp match they enter. 
---
That is on retail, and it was introduced in Cataclysm. In BC and LK, not only did you need Arena Points given only by winning arena games to earn gear, but **you needed team rating to buy items too**.
---
THat means you could buy bracers from 750 team value, and then needed 100 points more for each piece of gear you wanted. IIRC Spaulders were 1650 (which was already out of reach or almost of the average player), and weapons were ranging from 1750 to 1950 rating. And then you had epic gear at 2200, though i'm not sure if it was already there in BC. Point is, you rarely saw anybody with the PvP weapons.
---
Also, team ratings are not as inflated as they are now. Being 2k on retail nowadays is like being 1500 in BC/LK - if the difference isn't bigger. What you describe is not BC at all. I wonder if you started with Vanilla PServers or retail, but you apparently don't know/remember how it went during BC.
---
&gt; Making the entire game balanced around a deathmatch is inherently unfair to tanks and hybrids 
---
But this statement is anachronic of BC. Hybrids were ever less relevant after vanilla anyway. Tanks, even in Vanilla, were a rarity in PvP (world or BGs). I mean it would make no sense for Blizzard to take these two in consideration while they have big issues with balancing the game around the "normal" classes/specs in the first place.
---
&gt; tanks and hybrids who have great value in open world or objective based pvp 
---
But they generally don't, outside of some very specific scenarios ... Just look up what optimal team composition looks like for premading in Vanilla. Druids are not useful outside of flag carrying, Warrior tanks are nowhere to be found, Priests and Shamans are deep into their healing trees and living aside their hybridness".
---
&gt; Arenas made pvp easier for classes like rogues 
---
Oh deer ... Rogues were literally one of the highest skill cap classes in Arena, always ...
---
Does this mean that you can pull an entire room of meele mobs, pws, /sit and tank indefinitely?
---
This game is sandbox, you do what u want.
---
I only did it so I could say that I did and witnessed it tbh
---
Hybrid classes are always great in duels, Paladins have a lot of utility that Warriors do not in that regard.  If we are also blowing cooldowns a Ret Pally can also bubble and even BoP within a duel, let alone using lay on hands if that is on the table as well.
---
or JaVale McGee?
---
Not really sure how people are seeing a blood elf. I actually can only see 2 fingers, obvious blue skin, and that posture is way too straight for a belf. This is that blue/gold dress all over again.
---
:( did someone get countered too hard? It's ok, we don't do enough damage to kill you back. It's a vicious cycle.
---
Lets say this has nothing to do with why *"not many people want to tank in this game"*.
---
You guys are all clearly new and don't know much about what you're doing. But it's okey.
---
What you could've done in that situation is:
---
Instead of just pulling a mob and attacking it in that spot, pull the mob TO THE PREVIOUS ROOM. So when the mob tries to run away, it won't reach and pull any other mobs.
---
Extra info since you're a Paladin:
---
You have Seal of Justice. When you use Seal of Justice and use Judgement on the mob, that mob can't run away in fear. It's a waste of mana but it's good to know.
---
I usually pull the mobs a little backward, save my stun or finisher ability for when it's running.
---
You're learning, don't give up on what you're enjoying now, gl.
---
Dps tanking 2h for princess run are fun.  Until the healer runs out of mage water.
---
melee crit + priest shield + no crits = jamflex pls
---
My deepest apologies for not understanding the exact same way everyone else did. If I had the slightest idea that it would set off such a shit storm, I wouldn't have said anything.
---
Can hear them, they're the turbo nerds arguing in vent
---
First of all, the crime isn’t being an idiot. IT IS LITERALLY ATTACKING A SERVICE PLATFORM.
---
Are you this fucking dense?
---
Warlock has a huge amount of damage reduction with the right spec, something along the lines of 70%
---
Tanking has always been about keeping your healer alive while three children try their hardest to kill you.
---
ready to get banned?
---
So it would be easier to compete with tens of thousands of players as opposed to maybe 250-300 people tops?
---
people like you are the reason why layering is so misunderstood because your too stupid to actually know what layering is and use every chance to shit on it even when like in this instance layering makes things better or easier to complete.
---
also spawns a bunch of extra elites that beat you down
---
Is there an add-on you use for adding notes or is there something in the default UI?
---
Ah, yeah that's different for Horde then. Alliance quests are similar, but totally separate chains.
---
Bugs are ranked and addressed based on severity. There's not a universal linear queue that every bug has to wait through. You should report all bugs including ones you think are important enough to merit a Reddit call to arms.
---
There have been DDoS attacks that have took out ISP's and backbone servers before. One attack even took down Dyn a company that controls a shitload of the internets DNS infrastructure.
---
Yea, i don't actually believe any guild has that sort of rule, as many here seem to mention.
---
Lol I was in that raid. Us not par taking in their nerd rage were laughing our asses off.
---
I hardly ever use it unless there is a lot of time inbetween attacks
---
... There's so much wrong with this statement
---
backstab is so fun tho
---
I can only mash sinister strike so many times, before i'm like "what am I even doing this for"
---
Christ I WISH I met people like that so I can make fun of em
---
Some people find watching paint dry fun, and I'm still gonna judge them for it.
---
“Darnassus Flight Master” = State actor. Definitely counts
---
It's hard to tell right now.  On live vanilla it was absolutely herbs because all the top guilds were burning through consumables so there was a constant need for herbs.  On classic and especially right now I don't think they'll be nearly as pricey, since people blow through content much quicker, and the only current raid is a joke.  There's also the problem that everyone is doing gathering professions "to make money while leveling" and far fewer are crafting, so basically every market is flooded.  So yeah, that's a lot of words to say I don't know, but maybe it'll help in some way.
---
bug doesnt work anymore anyway
---
Something I should have mentioned in my post, you should wait for Serpent Sting to fall off your target or don't use it till after you FD because that dot dmg will either negate you from leaving combat, put in you back combat immediately, or briefly let u outta combat before putting u back in combat.
---
I dont think choosing a faction where your enemies cant remove your main CC spell for free is delving that hard into min maxing. 
---
Plus if we're talking about higher level PvP zones, the definition of an average player changes. If someone is going to put that much time into the game I expect them to at least do some level of research on what race or faction works best for their class
---
Agreed. But also there isn't a FP every 500 feet. And Hearths take 1hr vs. 30min.
---
Glass half empty sorta person eh?
---
You look like a real tit right now.
---
Mike - what server are you on? If you're on Atiesh, check out our guild, Requiem. Our website is Requiem.cc
---
I wouldn't be enjoying classic as much if it weren't for having such an awesome, social guild.
---
Ding is fine. hello every time you log in...Meh...
---
You don't need to raid at all, just wait for upcoming phases to farm honor and buy items.
---
At 305 skill 6%. Edgemasters does change that but not by a huge amount the first 5 points are most critical. The math after that isn’t 100% but I think edgemasters would take off .7% which really makes 0 difference since hit goes by full % points. So you’d still need 6% to not miss, you could go 5% but you’d miss .3% of the time.
---
I think u/IUSSR should share his epic story here...
---
Crazy idea: the players attack the person attacking them.
---
A TOS isn’t a tool that can be used to protect yourself fully from legs liability. [Here’s an example of what happens to load testing services that don’t require proof of ownership before testing.](https://securitytrails.com/blog/webstresser-seized-by-usdod)
---
Definitely not, that posture is perfectly straight with blue legs.
---
I mean leveling up is such a huge portion of Classic, if you are casually playing you have a good few more months of content to enjoy.
---
Pretty sure that's how the game worked in 1.12.
---
Did it end up being the person that bragged on Twitter or was that a fake/hacked acct?
---
Serious question: how do you stick with a main?
---
I hit level 30 with my mage and rolled a hunter. Hit lv20 hunter rolled a rogue. I'm now lv20 on my rogue and considering to reroll a warrior tonight. I keep finding faults in my characters and have a strong urge in re-rolling. Any inspiring words to keep me persevering to 60?
---
Lots of scaling issues.
---
It’s 1.5 levels. Not 2
---
hahaaaaaaaaa
---
little did they know that the final boss in there is one the first actual hard encounters in the game if you approach it at or slightly under-level
---
I think thats fair - while leveling odds are you won’t get 1 set of nice gear let alone 2. Its not gonna benefit the Druid to be in half DPS half healing gear either..
---
Not being a massacre =/= pvp being dead.
---
All flying stopped was people from being camped, fighting in front of instances and fights while traveling. Traveling wpvp was stopped with 100% mounts against most classes anyway and camping is an ugly side of wpvp. Fights inside of instances still existed in many places too, as some raids/dungeons were “no fly zones”.
---
You still fought over nodes, farm spots, pvp based quests (didn’t every zone have a PvP objective with noticeable benefits for everyone in the region, INCENTIVIZING pvp?), regular quests, people looking at you funny, etc. You no longer were camped by bored 60s in redridge, no longer were able to corpsecamp, and (this one is actually a negative) were less likely able to engage in 40v40 fights over buffs.
---
Did flying REDUCE wpvp? Yes. 
---
Did flying KILL wpvp? No. This is a circlejerk that started on this subreddit when it isn’t the case (maybe on some servers but definitely not the the game as a whole). Pservers with TBC had plenty of wpvp, and people on pve servers that played on the time probably experienced waaaay more fights than they did in places like the plague lands. I can’t speak for pvp server players.
---
must've been a retail player. probably watches asmongold.
---
#to shreds you say
---
Not really a made up rule, You couldn't report the other faction in vanilla. you can now. Meaning griefing rules are more easily applied. You said it yourself you and some others spent 1h 30min in 1 location. Anyone with a brain can guess the outcome being everyone reporting you that gets camped for 1h.
---
I think there's been a couple of blueposts through history about that explains how you can't camp 1 person or 1 location for too long and that you need to "move on" before it becomes an issue that effects the gameplay for a lot of people negatively.
---
In blizzards mind its a balance between what you consider fun and what others consider a shitty experience, no way in hell they are potentially losing subs just so you can have fun ganking lowbies.
---
Oh yea I see what you mean. True I've never been in a low level BG without the insane gear disparity.
---
level 35? that an alt?
---
OP, can you look at your combat log and tell how much damage is getting absorbed?
---
Additionally, can you confirm if the priest had stacks of inner fire up when this happened? Thinking since it’s melee only could be an issue with armor calculation as it relates to damage taken by the shield.
---
* Kill Alliance
---
* Eat their corpse
---
* Skin their pet
---
* ???
---
* Profit!
---
I prefer this implementation. We get to relive my nostalgia of wpvp pre-BG. I only wish BGs were server only.
---
Ehhh. It depends how good their testing/CI setup is. They clearly seem capable of pushing out fixes in short order in response to massive reddit posts.
---
Its not that people wont accept feral druids, its that healers are harder to find.  Just find a group that already has a healer.
---
My vanilla guild was awesome about it. If you said ding 35 crafters were checking their recipes to make sure you were up to date, everyone said grats and you felt part of the family. We stuck together through pretty much everything and, yup, people even met and got married. It's a different generation when people have an issue with empathy.
---
&gt;The only issue I have is that things die too quickly for my rip to be of any use
---
play warrior and you won’t have to worry about this anymore
---
A lot of these quests I have, will have 3 to 4 monsters grouped up and that’s it. I can poly one but the other three obliterate me
---
If you are unhappy with the colors etc in WoW, you can play around in the nvidia control panel color settings. Or just in the settings of the monitor itself. Increase vibrance a bit.
---
Level 40 seems a bit low to be tanking Uldaman with a two-hander.
---
Yes, but players can't resist, and its not firing against players.
---
Sometimes it is worth being a huntard to watch the world burn.
---
Yep
---
Not just E'ko, any mob that drops a quest item.
---
&gt; and doing dungeons is the most boring, brainless, anti-social crap I can imagine.
---
Someone has done literally 0 mythic + pushing.
---
You gave me a lot of hope and new ideas thank you :D
---
Lemme know if you figure this out.
---
I can't see Remove Curse on My Druid. Only get and option for Abolish Poison.
---
Makes it tough in some areas.
---
Is this gonna be considered a low quality meme as well? If you remove the text and overlay, it doesn't have anything to do with classic. I enjoyed this meme btw.
---
Thanks m8
---
How much of BRD has fire resist or immunity? I strongly prefer fire, but would also not like to hold my group back by gimping my damage too much.
---
!RemindMe 1 day
---
A good warlock can manage lifetap, DoT's and drain life so they never need to drink AND be no burden to healer. A bad warlock lifetaps to 1% health and 100% mana, then dies at the slightest AoE. Regen happens on health and mana, use that to your advantage while maintaining a decent health pool.
---
It completely disappears if it's a crit. In the video he does 5908 damage before the shield breaks. That's the entire health pool of a pretty geared Prot warrior before his shield breaks
---
Hes a rogue.
---
Corgis
---
&gt;this zone
---
That's just Strathholm...
---
My comment had everything to do with using the bug. People might not have seen it that way, but that's my fault for adding the last line, so downvotes are somewhat deserved.
---
Not just BRD, any instance just about. I have a whole host of quests that will give me some decent xp-to-gold conversion for sunken temple still and I haven't even been able to step foot in that dungeon. No one wants to run it. I had to abandon plenty of dungeon quests as I simply outleveled them without the opportunity to complete them, like RFD, or Uldaman.
---
Chen stormstout was also in warcraft 3
---
&gt; I will wait till the economy normalizes and then BAM. Rockefeller.
---
That's a huuge opportunity cost though. That's weeks/months of just having that potential gold "locked away", not able to invest in other things that could make you more money than you save by not selling now.
---
My Act of Kindness:
---
On Bootybay boat, I killed a horde 40 levels below me. He didn't release and went with the boat.
---
After the loading screen he gets an auto revive because that's how boat traveling works.
---
I didn't kill him again. So he didn't have to run to his corpse.
---
level 14 Undead Warlock: You're welcome!
---
This would never happen in the Horde
---
I'm pretty sure it is multiplicative.
---
That said, the aggression/threat talent is better suited.  Your healers won't have any issue keeping you alive for offtanking so the threat is more important than the armor.
---
Dont listen to all these fools nerdsplaining slow weapons to you. They are right about slow weapons for MM and raiding at 60, but it really doesn't matter while lvling. Hurricane is awesome and hands down the best bow to have while leveling. I would never suggest buying one as they are expensive, but if you have one enjoy it!
---
These commenters are just trying to flex their "knowledge" on a new player. Even then they are only half right anyway. There is waaay more to hunting than the marksmanship tree and raiding!
---
Paladins in 5-mans are OK for tanking or dps, but won't be taken in raids typically.
---
Thanks for the invite! Unfortunately i'm from EU
---
Had a horde spell out N I G G e R to me  after he 1 shotted me. Happens
---
I’ve had quest bosses sniped or attempted to be sniped from this.
---
I understand real world anxiety but never understood it online. Mute / Block / Ignore - move on. The person knows nothing about you, what do they even have to say that could be remotely true (without being a guess..) 
---
They can call you garbage, stupid or loser - whatever they want. These people don’t know what I get up to on the weekends, it just makes me laugh getting called a Virgin when your GF is coming over that day.
---
Someone says I have no life? Thats funny I have a few birthdays to attend this week.
---
Im sure you get the point.
---
I know how to use my class, I am asking what to farm. Please read the question before answering.
---
I made a comment that my budget can essentially be what it wants to be. I work a modest job, and live a very frugal life. I've been paying down mortgage aggressively and saving for retirement. I want to do what makes sense.  If you're telling me I can get a weaker laptop spec wise that will play hots and WOW on high settings for 2-3 years and then invest in an upgrade down the road  I'm happy to do it. If it is a better deal for me to pay more to have a laptop last me 4 years starting from today I'll do it.
---
Your right, screenshots and stealing other peoples art are much better.
---
Back in vanilla there was a rogue that would camp me and only me. He would follow me from zone to zone. Ignored everyone else. Made horde characters to whisper me. I reported him and he was actually given a permanent ban. He posted and complained about it later. No idea who he was or why he targeted me. He did this for over a week.
---
Just a heads up: rested XP caps at 3 lvls beyond your current level.
---
At least I'm almost positive that is the case in Vanilla.
---
Play defensively until he is out of mana, use a shield and prot stance, fear+bandage whenever you can. When he is out of mana whip out 2h and use Recklessness etc. If he bubbles at this point to try to kill you, use Shield Wall to wait out the bubble. It's still a hard fight but ret is very mana intensive and should run out of it very fast.
---
I shit on a mage in Hillsbrad 👍🏼
---
The cycle of violence continues
---
Thanks for the interest really, but i'm in EU Realms
---
Don't remember it, but it's pretty popular just Google it
---
Basically, yes, these people are spending hours or even says for a marginal attack speed increase.
---
Sometimes opening with CS - BS and then gouge and wait for the restealth then ambush - KS is a nice combo. Will only work if you have the talent to increase gouge to 5.5s tho.
---
This gave me a flashback to playing EQ when I was 15. What a grind that game was.
---
It sucks.. I got epic boe drops both around lvl 46-47 but no one to sell them to for a reasonable price. In my bank they go for another couple weeks
---
Same thing is happening on my Druid
---
Warriors are weak to paladins (and especially mages/casters) 1v1 unless they're insanely well-geared.
---
If what the poster is saying is true, then your crits shouldn't even be counting towards anything. If Ambush is breaking the shield, the damage is counted fine.
---
thats why he quit silly
---
I know. Pandaren are nothing new in wow. There is also the quest in barrens named chens empty keg
---
That was just a pserver thing.  You can summon anyone
---
To left, yes
---
I've seen people complain about memes being pulled with +1k upvotes. Obviously what is mediocre and seen by a "handful" of people is subjective.
---
I don't understand why anyone would argue against increased clarity and consistency in a rule. Neither of those are bad things.
---
I'm not even him and all I'm learning is that maybe I'd prefer a private server with less moderation...
---
and hence it was known as the I-fell tower
---
Crazy stuff, I can't believe Reddit makes this seem like an unpopular opinion. 
---
There are plenty of mofos who respond to my LFG postings that I straight ignore because I remember their greedy paladin ass coming in and rolling need on int/stam, int/spirit, str, agi, shields, one handed weapons, etc., as Ret. 
---
I know you have access to all armor profs but you came in this group as Ret and I accepted your request to join as such. Your bitch ass doesn't get to come in and ruin my guild's group that we specifically made because you might use that piece or you might use this one, or you tanked that one time.
---
No, we won't invite you and type out all of the items we expect to go to the individual best suited for the item before the dungeon begins, who actually does that? If anything, doing THAT makes you seem like the loot hungry crazy person. 
---
If anyone should state intentions, it's the person who joined that isn't rolling traditionally.. So I can choose not to invite them.
---
It's like players dont realize that groups often determine their group members based on class function AND loot competition.
---
The actual joke is what is low effort.
---
I think it means your attempt at humor was low effort, not the actual time you spent on making it.
---
Not flexing, just asking what people are farming at 60.
---
Some people here are all about the world PvP and get mad as soon as Horde and Alliance don't murder each other on sight.
---
Boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew
---
So you have to be at an inn and not just in a major city? If so damn I’ve been doing it wrong.
---
the worst is when ur pet dings and everyone around u is like grats so then you need to tell them it was just ur pet
---
Should be interesting to see, I suspect 19 will be the most extreme bracket in that regard.
---
According to wowwiki logging out not in a rested area gives one quarter the rate of gain as logging out at a rested area. So one bar every 32 hours.
---
Quick math says it would take 960 hours, 40 days, to fill 30 bars at that rate.
---
Graduated from Grand Exchange University, currently close to 2k gold in classic :)
---
&gt; It seems simple, until you actually try to do it. And then it's a fucking nightmare.
---
And hotfixes scare the fucking pants off of dev teams and application admins alike. Especially rushed hotfixes.
---
are you talking about resisting by chance? because that’s very different than what this dude is talking about. i’d say about &lt;5% of the time I use feign death, there is no animation, no drop in threat, no “resisted” alert, nothing to show the ability has been used other than the cool down.
---
also note that this happens on mobs above, at, and below my level.. so I don’t think it’s a resist issue
---
seems pretty buggy 2 me
---
&gt;i am a level 29 tank paladin
---
&gt;tank paladin
---
holup
---
I'll friend any tank that actually uses a shield and tanking abilities, and not that stupid Ravager axe. I just want to heal normal tanks pulling one group at a time, not these makeshift AoE runs that kill my mana every fight.
---
You're missing one important detail: realm pop is based on login queue, which is based on the amount of layering. Blizzard has started cutting down layers drastically since launch, which reduces server loads, and keeps realms "full" despite player drop-off. There is drastic player drop-off directly proportional to the decrease of layering.
---
Wow, not being able to pull 3 mobs at lvl 15, what a tragedy.  I'm not sure what other class you have in mind that pulls 3+ mobs at a time and aoe's them down consistently.  I suppose warlocks can once they get siphon life, but it's a bit slower.  Most any class all the way to 60 will have trouble with more than 2 yellow mobs at a time.  That's classic.  Especially starting fresh without any twink gear.
---
Thank you for speaking sense. I see so many posts on here "Hurr durr that guy is *faction* so he's worse than *faction*. 
---
Nah, both factions are equally bad. Shitty people do shitty things. Nothing to do with the faction.
---
I thought I remember it being 1.5 levels. But I'm not sure.
---
Same happened to me except i was dropped off at the mountain tops of the borders of Desolace and Mulgore. Im alliance . it was a long run back to civilization.
---
How is it "not firing" against players? That doesn't even make sense.
---
Definitely playtime. At this pace I will be 60 in the next 2-3 days.
---
Honestly I played a Priest in Vanilla.  Your shield really is just strong.  In halfway decent blue gear I could beat a level 60 warrior easy (warrior just isn't a good class against priest in vanilla.)
---
There may really be a bug, i dunno, but priest shield is very strong even without it.
---
I ran premade WSG High Warlord groups all the time where I ran flags instead of a tank or druid because of how strong shield was and I had the Skull of Impending doom offhand (60% speed buff at the cost of draining health.)
---
Dude is definitely selling knockoffs made from owlbears
---
Regarding what types there are, I'll try to list some:
---
-Full run for quests, shadowforge key
---
-Torch room farming for XP
---
-Emp runs for particular loot or to save princess quest, uses shadowforge key or even lava route to skip large parts of dungeon
---
-Arena/angerforge runs for particular loot (HoJ, Ban'thok Sash etc). Quick runs that can easily hit instance lockout.
---
I’m a 50 Druid and I plan on going resto at 60. Should I start prioritising resto gear now? I’m mostly decked out in feral gear. Should I just stick with my current feral gear for levelling but now choose resto based upgrades?
---
I’m really starting to feel dungeons sting a bit when I’m healing them now and 55+ when I start doing dungeons for pre-bis, I don’t want to be healing them in mostly agi gear.
---
&gt;  if this was flared appropriately.
---
At least it's not stealthed, we can still see it without flare.
---
Every faction is griefing, ganking, pvping and also letting people live. Peoples behaviour is not fucking defined by some arbitrary faction choice.
---
What you don’t understand is you have received a quest from the game. Now it’s time to go and have an adventure in town finding someone who can cure you
---
I've done ST, I've done pretty much every instance up to the 50+ ones, or rather I've done them as full quest runs.
---
Might be based on server pop, but while it may take a bit of time to gather a group, there's still tons of people willing to run stuf.
---
44 is actually the midway mark based on total XP needed from 1-60 :)
---
FD wasn’t this bad in the Beta.
---
It is not critical if the software still runs 🤷‍♂️
---
Day mode ***hiss***
---
in a 1v1 sure. but killing a hunter pet is something that happens in bgs/open world brawls. but yes, usually in an even matchup killing the hunter is far superior.
---
Hi, my name is katie
---
WELCOME TO JACKASS 
---
BANARARANNNNNWOOWWW
---
Feign death is not a bug. But feign death is bugged. See the example I’m trying to make?
---
Thank you ^_^
---
The picture of this thing has already been reposted countless times. We fucking get it, you like pot.
---
English?
---
Hahahah ok fine deleted
---
Aggro can spread indefinitely. As in, I've had a mob running away go near a person in combat, putting me in aggro with all the mobs that person is in combat with. That person fears, and a mob runs and aggros 4 more, then dies. Then ALL mobs involved run toward you. THis means that a mob that you've never been within 120 yards of beelines to you. This happened to me in the harpy place in barrens. I am almost positive this is not how it worked in vanilla (hardcore raider, well over 30 days played in vanilla).
---
Nice addition to the mouse over.  And, I tried putting the #showtooltip on mine, but reddit did something weird with it lol.
---
U good, no beef.  I just still understand you to be saying, don’t use serpent sting.  Which is doable but mad inefficient...
---
Don't forget to tip your mages!
---
There isn't normally many good choices for plate/mail gear for healing.  Most paladins mix in a few cloth/leather pieces to boost int.
---
I did reduce mana of shocks, then improve sesring totem, then clear. Not sure if searing is best since its so low lvl. Also think I seitch to full enhance at 40.
---
Also important to think about where you’re buying it from.  Upscale shop in Org?  Probably OK.  Folding tables set up outside Crossroads?  Be wary.
---
Ideallly STR and AGI gear is the best though.
---
Its more likely you just dont understand how crit chance works; see https://youtu.be/lLD12oUwJoE?t=914
---
you can do zombies at 41-42 really.
---
i did cath with 3 mage 1 lock eye pulling and a priest to shield the eye. took no time getting to 41 and then switching a mage or lock for a tank in ZF all the way to 51 when you can do BRD prison
---
You gotta remember to factor in the 19% increased miss chance. It affects both weapons, and thus reduces your damage by roughly 20%.
---
It's like a bottomless bowl of chips and salsa, except with dicks and nobody likes him.
---
Bat + Son of Hakkar once ZG comes out. Gotta get that rank 6 lightning breath.
---
Lmao alright mate. I don't expect someone "outraged" over bugs he can't even evaluate the impact of to make good character judgements.
---
I've been like you before, don't worry, once you get some self awareness perspective will come along as well
---
Could he be in Fear/MC range?
---
The fourth is a troll.
---
This is the debate everyone is having and only you guys can really decide. Nobody really knows what the servers will look like in 3-6 months. 
---
It is harder because you need 40 to fill a raid now, but I'm sure you can fill that on any server.
---
Yes, they do. Especially until they get a good crit %
---
if you're healing a dungeon on a hybrid, chances are that'll be your raid spec too. feral dps and ret sucks ass and shouldn't be taking gear from real dps jobs just so they can be a special snowflake.
---
Wf is good, but going into the 39 bracket also means you have to deal with every other classes  lvl 30 spells.
---
I think shamans have plenty at 29 to be competitive.
---
Not that extensive testing no. Good ideas though. I tested this against  3 different priests though, with different specs.
---
&gt;Because some people show up for every raid and never get loot and some people do 1 raid a month and get every drop.
---
Yes, exactly the way it should be.
---
I don’t think changing layers while out in the world is an issue. If a layer is too crowded, I sometimes ask for a layer swap. But I swap layers maybe once every 5 hours of playtime. 
---
The layer abuse was mostly those who exploited it inside instances. Those people deserve bans. 
---
The occasional layer swap invite is fine. Constant layer swapping is probably fine, but I would not risk it.
---
Abusing layer swapping in instances is a major issue, and people get banned for it.
---
only if your a herbalist.
---
Shield block activates Revenge which is your best threat-per-rage in your entire toolkit.
---
Demo Shout isn’t the instant threat generator it used to be, but it and Battle Shout still generate enough threat to keep aggro off your healer.
---
There's probably another factor at play, likely a talent that's causing this. My 44 Shadow Priests shield is nowhere near this durable.
---
Yeah, a clear oversight, we'D ALWAYS allow / encourage / force non-druids to leave
---
Looks like retail to me.
---
I literally posted this an hour ago
---
If it makes you feel any better they probably wiped multiple times or never finished, unless they were all fairly over leveled, one tough ass fight that one is.
---
I remember CoH and GW but what other ones were there?
---
Pretty much confirmed that the ex_iled dude has nothing better to do than use his awful discretion removing threads. Look at his post history. It’s kind of embarrassing tbh.
---
Yup, makes them drink way less.
---
Lots and lots of caffeine.  I’m level 56.25, once I hit 60 I’m going to take a couple of days off.
---
lol mid october there are plenty of 60s with their epic mount now
---
Yes. If he needs it he needs it. Even if he’s not healing this particular dungeon, he has no obligation to you nor you to him as far as gear. Upgrades are upgrades.
---
&gt; Go to any high-school and get a teenager to guide you through Windows.. get them to open Command Prompt. 
---
Do you genuinely think they should be teaching these kids how to use a CLI rather than how to use more commonly required functionality like editing documents and searching for things on the internet?
---
Even as someone who spends a ton of time writing firmware, I rarely use the command prompt or the terminal.
---
It's considered a form of harassment, or at least it use to be since it can make the mailbox unusable until you clear it. So you can get a temp ban for it.
---
This is not true at all. Classic is years behind in accuracy if you go by pserver pase. There are so many bugs it's ridicules.
---
They will get fixed though, and maybe in 3-6 months classic will be ahead of what pservers were. Blizzard can obviously fix shit way faster and to a more accurate end result due to having more manpower and of course the 1.12 client.
---
I’m sorry, but your post was removed for low effort trolling.
---
I literally played hunter in vanilla for years and on multiple private servers. This is how its always worked. Its not like retail and im sorry if thats what you were expecting

Honestly though OW on launch was balanced better than it is now.
---
NeatPlates does it.
---
The best memes are the simplest memes, doesn't mean they are low effort. Personally I thought your post was fucking hilarious and actually shared it with a bunch of my friends. Come on mods, what the hell!?
---
Yes I played in Vanilla and remember it. Every level past 20 was not a feat. It was slow, but not difficult.
---
What about my post came off as hysterical? I don't have a dog in this fight at all, but Blizzard' s beta was a joke from a QA perspective, and they should be called out for it.
---
I remember seeing a pretty good meme get closed for being "low effort" then a few days later someone else posted the exact same meme. Doesn't get closed for "low effort".
---
Then leave. We won’t miss you.

Frost shock!

Any Resto Shamans out there healing ZF GY farms? I'm curious what kind of XP/Hr you're getting, and your group composition?
---
Well those bugs are being looked at so many my +5 damage enchant on gutgore ripper wasn't wasted after all.
---
Well you certainly don't understand how to reply properly. :)
---
Been using this on my sham at 60 (AoE is mana intensive okay?) and ive never seen this happen :o
---
Something like /tukui chat reset worked for me. It took me a long time to figure this out.
---
We have a "class" lead at 59 today desperately trying to keep the role he had on his pserver with the guild, we've done rag 3 times now, 5 if you count the split raid for the 2nd and 3rd MCs.
---
What if someone just has life goals?
---
As someone who works on a software product of similar age, it's usually "this one piece of shit monolithic file has like 90% of the relevant logic and it's full of a bunch of abstract cases to deal with old bugs caused by the old infra from that time we were adopting Apache Mesos but then we gave up on that but the guy who wrote it all left the company 13 years ago and also he never wrote any comments."

Funny thing but pally his chest until t3 is a cloth spell dmg 2 crit chest from garr or lucifron ithink
---
I'm level 38 and basically playing now in my spare time only with rested experience. Literally because of life. If anyone wants to lend me gold for the mount get in touch!
---
Never said you were wrong please go up and reread what I said. In a few months when everyone has their epic mounts and income to dispose of that thing will be a bigger flex. But I understand if you didn't understand.

---
Is it just me or does it still seem surreal that we have Classic WoW? Every time I think about that video announcing it I get shivers. Seems like a great place to hit 60!
---
Its crits that do it. If you rogue is only critting half the time he will still break through it. 
---
But yes there may be others factors like various talent choices.
---
Ive got a couple extra big road flares, so I can see the appeal
---
Probably a talent that's causing this and most priests go shadow to level which has no talents associated with pws or getting hit by stuff.
---
This prebis thing is driving me bonkers. It’s like, ya I want nice gear too but you don’t need it for mc (you may even be swapping part of it with crappy fire resist). It has a grind the gear grind the raid quit playing feel to it. Which I know a lot of people did back in the day but it isn’t what made classic feel like classic
---
Might just be a PVP thing
---
You’d be surprised. There will be some groups that turn you down, but many will give you a shot since tanks are in such low supply.
---
My rolls aren’t good either
---
Of course, but when I open on double digits orcs with cheap shot and I can remember one time that it wasn't resisted. So confirmation bias it might be, but those are really shitty odds man
---
So that’s it. Just not having to run back is the deal?
---
Jesus. As someone who spent a stupid ammount of time farming these backbin vanilla and tbc Im kind of impressed you had two drop.

I’m bored of you now, blocked.
---
Absolutely loving playing my Shaman (enhancement).  It's not the same level of awesome as TBC mind you (though obv classic has the advantage of 2handers) - but its leagues ahead of anything post-wrath.  That said, I'm getting pretty tired of reading on this sub and other places how people dislike totems compared to retail versions.  In retail, they last for a few seconds, they have minutes worth of cooldowns, and their effects are mostly unnoticeable - they aren't even totems any more.
---
The code wasn't broken. It was working as intended.
---
Have you ever played Skyrim? Remember when people figured out how to exploit alchemy and enchanting to create an infinitely scaling feedback loop where you could make enchanting potions, then enchant your gear to fortify your alchemy, then make stronger enchanting potions to get strong alchemy enchants. You could do it forever until you got your enchanting level to a point where your gear made you invincible?
---
That was NOT a bug, it was an exploit. The game and the coding was doing exactly what it was programmed to do, players were just exploiting a flaw in the way the game was designed.
---
Instance layering was just players exploiting a flaw in the way layering was designed. The coding itself was not bugged.
---
It is an exploit, not a bug.
---
They obviously meant Princess Theradas.
---
Give it three months bub.
---
Yet you’re still lurking on a subreddit dedicated to classic. If you’re going to leave actually leave. Don’t stay and shit on something clearly tons of people are enjoying. Why are you so obsessed with something you apparently think is trash? Why waste your own energy on something you don’t like? Go do something you enjoy ya dingus.
---
Hustle. Loyalty. Respect.
---
I was with a healer in deadmines that would type out a long sentence about how he needs to sit an drink every single time he went oom and by the time he would hit enter he would have been done.
---
I tried to explain this to him but he didnt get it and got agitated so i just left it alone lmao.
---
I AM ENRAGED!
---
but I will probably get over it
---
It is when you have like 2 FPs, yea
---
He didn't even roll on it for the frost damage, it was for mp5. This guy is just stupid.
---
It's only on a melee hit iirc. So hunters using it as a stat stick would get 0 use out of them
---
The only time Stalagg is ever low is at like 5-10 AM on mid week when most people are at work or school. For 9-5ers you basically had to wait in que every single day since launch. My entire guild just bounced from Stalagg . we were sick of waiting
---
Solo but that's the way I like it. I just want a ripe world with a fair amount of lfg's for fast progress.
---
Also, HS takes 60 min. Not 90.
---
Why are people downvoting you? Everyone up in arms for layering exploit but defending this boss exploit? 
---
Someone even had the audacity to say “if it was an exploit blizz would just fix it.” Is that guy srs? They could have fixed layering exploit as well but instead just banned people for exploiting it.
---
Arena/angerforge/golem dude gear runs. Did a buttload of those for my mage and healers. Aka wnd half gear runs. Or chest of 7 runs
---
I always struggled with Priests. They were the class where my dots didn’t matter and if I didn’t get a Soulfire crit they would manage to just sustain until I was oom. Priest was the only class where I felt like I might lose a 1v1.
---
And use rank 1 only.  
---
It's such an underrated spell.
---
Paladin scale with gear as well, in vanilla with blue honor set and unstoppable force i was able to beat in 1v1 a lot of aq40 and r14 people.
---
However warrior cant beat a paladin if he is half good and have cd.
---
Them turning into a bear in bed is like 90% of why druids are good
---
Everything is electons and protons, nothing has meaning, let people do things that make them mildly content bruh
---
Nah, that's just what pushes them into acceptable tier. You put in 110% effort for 80% of a normal rogue/warrior's performance.
---
&gt;Implying rogues get invited to groups
---
Good one, you got me chuckling
---
But it isnt a true vanilla experience. Look at the patch we began with, its not the first live patch. Theres also the whole (playername)-(servername) when you whisper someone. Thats not vanilla. People know where to go quest, you can easily find what every item is used for, i dont recall ever doing a "spellcleave" or cleave group while doing dungeons.  
---
Layering isnt a thing in vanilla and it highly influences the AH. We arent getting the vanilla experience. Thats why its odd to timegate certain things and have people like you try and defend it. The only reason i can see blizz doing it is just to get the most money out of subs.
---
You could be right, but using both bolt and shock sounds pretty mana intensive, that's the only worry I would have. But if your mana is regening a nice amount before next pull it must be fine.
---
This idea is even worse than the previous, a lot of new mechanics which have more cons than pros, at least in my opinion.
---
From what I've been talking to other people, we do not know for certain if once layering is gone the server cap will "decrease" to 3k players (let's assume servers now cap at 15k players and each layer at 3k players). What could happen is that the player cap will continue the same 15k, but everybody will be cramped together one the same "layer".
---
Queues won't necessarily be a thing again, but I am absolutely sure that our Classic Azeroth cannot fit 15k people. It seems to me like the problem we're going to be facing soon is, if server capacity doesn't decrease because of layers being removed, how is the game gonna behave?
---
Imagine we hit Phase 2, layering is no more and a given PvP realm's capacity is 15.000 people with ~30% of the population at level 60. 5 thousand people competing for a handful of resources is going to be intense. A few months later, still in Phase 2, when ~70% of the population is level 60, 10 thousand people competing for the same resources is going to be just painful. Once Phase 3 hits, BGs are finally in and things might get a bit better, but still, it seems quite crowded to me.
---
I'm not an expert, but I don't think Classic Azeroth was made to hold more than ~7 thousand players simultaneously.
---
correct!
---
The tier 0 set bonuses are a joke and not worth pursuing.  If you are trying to complete the set it is for vanity reasons not power level.
---
The wounds go deep
---
That's their racial bro.
---
What ui is this?
---
Where did you see i have 2 fps?
---
I played Lineage 2 a lot back in 2007-2010 and WoW vanilla is just a children casual game as opposed to what Lineage 2 is. Yes, the grind is harder in Lineage but it’s not even the main thing.  The key feature of L2 is constant world pvp since there are no instances AT ALL. You found an interesting levelling spot - fight for it. Wanna get an epic ring from a raid boss - fight for it against other clans, because there is no place where you cannot be killed by other players apart from cities. If your clan can’t fight for that boss, you’ll never get the ring. You died? Well, you’re gonna lose some % of XP and in some cases you might also drop a random item from your inventory. So if you are a high-levelled guy with epic items in L2, it means you have proven yourself as a decent fighter and everyone most likely already knows you. And what about WoW? Level 60 mage getting max level in a week constantly spamming aoe in dungeons is reality. Nobody knows you, nobody ever saw you anywhere outside dungeons and raids but who cares? Beating scripted images is all you need for getting a top gear and destroying everyone afterwards. And someone calls this game hard, lol.

Fair, when you say “preparing them for the future” I consider most of the jobs to be at least slightly IT based.. with the potential for full automation you better know how to do that stuff otherwise you ain’t doing much.

I’m making a statement - i don’t really care what your opinion or response is, you could spend all day convincing me children are tech wizards and I know thats straight up false.
---
Going to have to suggest this with my group of friends.

We might end up creating an all druid/rogue guild.

&gt; Like I said earlier, my server is harsh life for Allinace. We're always heavily outnumbered. I died nearly 50-100 times in STV.
---
This guys Stalaggs
---
I am only 30, but I have gotten one whisper like the one in the post. Ironically it was after a group wipe + someone in the group leaving. We just kept grinding away though and I pulled slowly and steadily with plenty of instruction and marking and the such.
---
The healer whispered me and essentially said thank you for being patient and for persevering through the tough spots, and that they would be happy to heal me whenever. 
---
Sometimes making a friend isn't about being the best possible tank, sometimes it's showing that you are a nice human who can handle things going wrong and move forward without getting angry or mean to the group. 
---
I would rather have a messy run with fun, nice people who realize we are playing a ridiculous elf simulator, then have a perfect run with high strung min maxers who treat a second of wasted time as a disaster.

For real....institutionalizing restriction of art?   
---
I didn't know Reddit was the defining authority on all cultural policies in society.   
---
Does this OP realize not everyone has the same ideals as him? He came here to have people agree with him, and he got it, so he can feel better about being mad...because now others relate to him.  
---
This fits what I posted above about no discussion, low effort content generated from memes. The OP is spending his time getting angry at dissenting opinions, and only responding positively with people that say "I like ur meme". Has anyone seen /r/dankmemes? Do people talk about the concept of the meme etc? No, everyone types F or makes jokes about 42069, rushes to be the first to type an overused meme in the comments, or area 51.   
---
As suggested in other comments, the OP can create his own subreddit, but I believe he is pushing back on this because he knows how hard it is to moderate a community objectively.
---
Realmobhealth
---
There are many things to come. One possibility that has been thrown around is that people will go back to Retail and feel like they've done all they can for the week and still want more to do and will head back to Classic as a result. That being said if this future does happen we will see a dip, and then a rise some time after.

it reminds me EVE Online 'legacy code' thing from when i played it. Even small update had chance to break something completly irrelevant. e.g. after updating market mechanic same update breaks missions/quests.
---
Found the shaman
---
If the healer has no Mana I just innervate and pull anyway.
---
Yea I don't do it in dungeons and stuff. Just when I'm in open world questing and killing trash mobs that are kinda scattered across the massive Barrens.
---
Light of Elune in the streets, beast of nature in the sheets.

Holy crap

I take a rogue for its utility, same with a mage that ahould give water to the healer or same for a shaman thay doesnt use their totems.

Dont want to bring it? You get kicked.

Engineering is good once PvP is added in Phase 2/3.
---
That was not necessary in classic. It is not working as it did.
---
Find a friendly priest in town. I hear they know how to cure many ailments.
---
Depends on who he was fighting.  Lots of high powered mobs for that level near deadmines.  Fear a level 19 into a pack of Defias and watch.
---
Imagine not having good pet micro and thinking it’s better to have a wolf spam howl next to you for 5 dps because of that.
---
I'd say it's just anything that pulls a mob to the Warlock (so not Life Tap directly, but your damage output that results from it).
---
If you're using threat meters or just figured out how to not pull mobs, DOT all you want! When I'm doing heals, if I've got mana to spare, you'll get heals -- if you're pulling agro every other battle, you get no heals.

---
Yes 100%, if you need it you need it. I wouldn't group with people again if they complained that a healer rolled on cloth
---
so, for the four weeks I have had enemies evade my attacks when I sent a pet to attack them, I should have instead made a post on reddit and paid a bot army to make sure it reaches the front page?
---
Flurry Axe is bis for horde warriors, so while others have said shamans can't dw, horde warriors will still want it.
---
I see layering as a temporary and necessary evil, and the existence of layers is less of a detriment to the game than them not existing. Sure, it sucks that people are abusing them.

They are going away in P2, don't be Chicken Little about it.

Grr goons, etc.

I just don't get the "people will come back to retail".  They don't seem to understand that the people that wanted to play classic WERE NOT PLAYING RETAIL.  I stopped playing years ago - the last time they got 2 subs in a row from me was the start of Cata, end of discussion.
---
Bye friend
---
Do you understand what is supposed to happen when you are standing behind someone as a melee class? Their critical strikes are supposed to actually do damage.
---
I'm surprised you can't see the problem with a rogue's Ambush crit doing absolutely nothing to a shielded priest.
---
Or a warrior with Recklessness doing 5908 damage to priest without breaking their shield....
---
He almost did win.
---
Yea, levelling especially as early Alliance is great. Westfall -&gt; Redridge &gt; Westfall -&gt; Duskwood -&gt; Redridge &gt; Westfall -&gt; Duskwood -&gt; Redridge
---
By the time I was about done with Duskwood the whole area felt like... well, and actual place. I'd gone through everywhere different ways several times, it didnt feel like "AIGHT NEXT ZONE GIMME 5 LEVELS"
---
I'm down for gating gear progression, but it would have been cool to have BGs available without rewards.

---
Gnomeregan and Deadmines have nothing that is obscenely good for the level.  Shamans/hunters use SM to get mail.  Warriors love using their WW axe.  And clothies have literal pinatas from the 4 wings.  SM is waaaay more popular than the others.
---
Spirit/int is resto gear.
---
Stick with feral gear from quests, unless there's no good feral option than anything cloth really will do the trick.
---
When you are going to dungeons (BRD especially has a TON of gear there you can use), pick up some easy "of the owl" greens from the AH. Super easy to make the switch.
---
You can heal as a druid even as feral if you wanted to start now in ZF. (just heal earlier, +0.5 second cast time on healing touch hurts a bit and make sure you downrank heals!)
---
There's a handful of pieces in ZF which are decent, off of the troll temple boss. (can't remember his name, the witch doctor drops the voodoo chest/legs amazing starter pieces)
---
Even going as a feral tank is fine too, and just let your party know what you are after. If your healer DOES need something that's a significant upgrade, just pass, and get it next time around. People are pretty easy going, a few I encountered were happy to roll against me as we were going to farm the place for hours.
---
Only problem with totems is that other people don’t understand how to play around them and mobs aggroing fire totems.
---
It makes no sense to me, in a role playing game, to not fear the collection of races that you are literally at war with.
---
It absolutely ruins the world, to me, if I cannot kill or be killed by my literal enemy.
---
That is why I will never play a PvE server. It just feels so entirely wrong.
---
NS every time.
---
That's really cool but for me it was sadly the exact opposite experience. I am still in close contact with most of my friends and we hang out regularly but the only thing I got from them was: They are making a remake of WoW? What about WoW2??? One of my friends who never played wow even came up to ask if we're going to be addicted again. But most of my friends are like war veterans. They treat their time in the game like an old war they fought in and repeat the same heroic stories over and over, but there is no interest to go back. They were in utter disbelief when I told them Ragnaros was downed the first week the game was out. I am a bit different since I go back to the game every now and then because I still have some friends online who actively play and it's easy to get back into raiding through them. While it is not the same game that it was 15 years ago, it has always been a worthwhile experience for me, at least from time to time.

---
In other words, a blanket statement that tier gear is terrible is just as wrong as saying there is only a 5% performance difference.  It is all over the place and claiming an absolute is missing a lot of factors.
---
I'm a rogue, and I actively level lockpicking when I get the chance. Sure keys and explosive charges can lockpick, but even if there is one it isn't likely they crafted many of those, let alone waste a slot of their tiny inventory for them. And even then, why use an item when the rogue can open it for you?  
---
So if it's locked, the rogue gets to open it unless specified otherwise (key/explosive). Refusing to open or keeping the loot gives bad rep which can go a long way, so what I do is some middle ground solution: I keep the coins (only me can see that anyway) if some drop, and I trade the loot to the winner. They receive all the loot they see in chat and don't feel cheated, and I get a little something for the service.  
---
For nodes and quest clickables though, I like taking turns more. Too little of a change to be worth rolling.  
---
That said I play mainly with my friends, so I don't have issues with chest loot. I open them all, and the loot goes to whoever needs (mana pot to the healer, ores to our blacksmith, herbs for our alchemist, cheap greens to the enchanter, etc) and I keep the rest (greys/food). Only exception is bags, I'm the biggest grinder of us and I'm already abusing the mailboxes as bank, so they don't mind me keeping the bags.
---
It must be a day ending in “y”
---
Pservers.  I briefly played on a pserver where you could do this.  My highest vanilla nelf was around 30 so I don't really recall either way.
---
Ah my mistake, I read it as "are able to arrest IN a few days". Apologies!
---
No, no, no, it's 2019, you have to take everything in the most offensive context that you can!
---
mandela effect? I think you just have a shitty memory
---
Given that wow is a multiplayer game, you should try grouping up with others to help you.
---
Yeah, about 50+ when I started hunting down my pre raid bis I started doing that and people understood. 
---
But while leveling it really set people off, and its not enjoyable for me to get labeled a ninja every other dungeon and have randoms try to fight me  because I needed a bop cloth glove upgrade
---
Seems like the guy in the pic does.  Def. a personal problem.
---
That is awesome but it'd be funnier if you waited 'til he was almost at the boat.
---
What would the penalty be for such a thing? It’s not a bank and it’s nothing military or government related where one could expect severe penalties. 
---
Anyone have info on similar cases?
---
2/10 at best
---
Would mostly be doing it for PvP purposes...swords is okay but the damage isn’t quick enough. When Cheap Shot/Kidney Shot runs out they’ll usually have ~25-30% health left and plenty of time to use their movement abilities/slows/stuns and escape. Hoping daggers would allow me to burst people down quicker
---
There is a difference between an unintended effect due to a flaw in the the way the code actually executes and an unintended effect due to a flaw in the way the code was designed. 
---
They are taking advantage of a design flaw in the code. Design flaws are not bugs, they are human error.
---
You know nothing about Paladins
---
Don't come to AR if you are worried about what people you don't ever play with are doing. Do come if you want to actually play the game. 
---
I'll never understand the lemming mentality people have.
---
S
---
Phase 2 you will have access to a pvp trinket, that should help you against fears.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18859/insignia-of-the-alliance
---
So against warlocks you're racing against their dots or their burst. The pvp trinket will remove slows, fears and polymorph effects which is great, be wary against seduction from the succubus. Even then, pvp trinket will be your "I win" button against warlocks and priests, since that's their primary form of cc. Against warlocks especially, if you break the first, counterspell the second, they are locked out of their primary damage source for a time.
---
So on to your first point, in world pvp especially, if you are losing, you can cc and run. There's no point in continuing a losing fight. You're a mage who has some of the best CC in the game, use it. Frost nova/poly, blink run a distance away, drop combat, mount and get out of there.
---
Also know that if you are against a good druid, it's an 80-20 matchup, in favor of the druid. Beyond that, you should have a decent time against most classes.
---
I'd rather compete with a couple dozen players for 1 hour that I can plan around than sit on a hill and do nothing but spam eagle eye at 3 points on a map for up to 8 hours, yes. I can get a few guildies to help me for an hour, but I'm not about to ask them to sit with me for up to 8. 
---
The difficulty of dealing with the long spawn timer is mitigated by it's regularity. That's the trade-off. Take away that regularity via layering and all you're left with is a long timer that you can't ever know the status of without constantly being on for multiple spawns and never joining a group. I've spent over 70 hours camping BT between Vanilla and Classic, I have a little bit of experience with this. Maybe stop to think a little bit or try it yourself before you start calling other people stupid.
---
All day this. Pvp server or not, griefing someone for hours and refusing them to play the game they paid for, should and is bannable
---
Interesting. I'll let the guy know
---
It's a lopsided matchup
---
My vanilla dueling record against even maximum geared warriors is pretty close to flawless. A very lucky sword spec or crit spree is the only way a warrior should ever win
---
Otherwise, you're right. Paladins hit almost as hard, bypass a lot of your armor class with their damage, and if they ever start looking wounded they'll just stun, bubble, stun, other bubble, stun
---
If you can kill them 5 times before they kill you once, you can win
---
Could be about rappers in general - Eminem / 2pac / Biggie all had movies. Notorious I really enjoyed.
---
Milk a mage for fresh cool water!
---
The layering exploit had a significant impact on the game, this not only has no significant impact on the game but it's also debatable that it can be called an exploit, people aren't taking advantage of a bug or unintended design flaw, which is typically what an exploit is.
---
Rogue takes all white/grey items. Group rolls on greens/blue/epics.
---
System is fair to both the rogue who spent time leveling a profession and the group who made the chest accessible.
---
Go floss more.
---
I only buff warriors because they are the only ones worthy and suffering, everyone else can have self buffs and a lot of utility.
---
&gt;Literally cloth gear? No
---
lmao what? All the healing gear is going to be cloth.
---
Yeah bad DPS actively drive away probably 75% or more of potential tanks
---
You’ve quite the shitposter, judging from your history. 
---
10/10 would downvote again.
---
Since you are focused on dps, you'll likely want to go into ele. Resto will give you the 3% hit talent, but that's about it - everything else in the resto tree at that tier will only increase your healing/totem abilities. If it were me I would probably go for convection, call of flame, elemental focus, reverberation, elemental devastation.
---
Btw apparently Serathil (blue item) and bonehatchet from stratUD is better than flurry for offhand. So you can check the price on serathil or just farm some stratud, I'm sure you'll probably get one before baron cloak anyway lol
---
this reads like it was posted on r/iamverybadass
---
I’d rather have a ret pally heal than dps. If they don’t have a ravager they are so far behind every other dps spec that it’s completely a bad decision to pick one over anything else. Even with a ravager they are still pretty bottom tier.  
---
It’s just objectively a waste of time to take some specs over others.
---
Often times feral druids overlap items that are good for rogues. And it doesn't mean I'm planning to use it for feral DPS, it overlaps even for tanking gear.
---
And if it's an item for that will be used for leveling and going to be replaced by both classes prior to raiding anyways, you can bet your ass I'm rolling on it.
---
SL/Nightfall or SL/Shadowburn warlocks are monsters in classic, but in TBC SL/SL becomes a thing and really turns warlocks into raid bosses.
---
There might be some 60s in the game now, but none of them have gear that's worth a damn. If they did, they wouldn't have time to be dicking around in lowbie zones.
---
Yes absolutely lol
---
As somebody who also replied already said, it is exposure. There's a difference between a robot delivering goods to your front door and you going to the store and interfacing with humans. It is trivial, I agree, but it is still social. These little things really do add up.
---
It seems if your layer/server crashes, your flight point progress isn't tracked so you just get dropped wherever you were. My buddy got dropped into a mountain range and it took him a while to get out lol
---
This happened to me... into the ocean :(
---
Oof
---
Can you remove your own auto-Upvote from the post ? I wan't to see it reach 0% upvotes.

Imposter! The real Thrall has blue eyes!
---
I don't think *everybody* is going to use it in battlegrounds.
---
Engineering might be the best PvP profession, but that doesn't mean that it's a huge deciding factor in a large scale confrontation.  Being able to toss an Iron Grenade for a chance at a short stun and a little damage isn't going to affect much in a big chaotic battle-field.  It's more of a niche for world PvP, to maybe shut down a big spell and give you a second to start your own cast, that sort of thing.
---
Those are Asmongold hours, its not surprising to me at all.
---
Yeah you’re right, how DARE someone express concern for a realms population activity &amp; economy when scouting transfer options for a guild

This is not the only difference, and not even true anyway.

What happens if I delete a say lvl 30 horde toon and begin leveling an alliance toon then ask to restore my horde character again?
---
And thus, a copy pasta was born. Such beauty...
---
I gotta say, that sonofabitch back at the bank don't fight fair
---
Priest’s WISH they could get this hat!
---
What about hitting 10 for the last pvp gear pieces?
---
Well, you are right and I deserve the downvotes.
---
Get off your high horse. Horde and alliance are both simultaneously ganking jerks and helpful pacifists. Its not so black and white.
---

Most beneficial pvp and pve combo is tailoring/eng but you’ll need some bank flow to make that work so it’s not great to start out
---
Hold on to it! Once realm economy picks up a bit and more players hit 60, that axe will become even more valuable. On nost and kronos I've seen the axe sell for 500-1000g, same with edgemasters
---
What's really funny is that a lot of private servers overturned the raids.
---
Rogues get Vanish, hunters get Feign Death. That's it.
---
Honestly I would like to hear people's thoughts. I know I love priests, but I am afraid that I get bored of levelling a new one, since I already levelled another to 51
---
Project harder lol
---
Having someone go off in tells about how terrible I am for need rolling cloth healing gear while I'm already in the next dungeon group is chicken soup for my soul.
---
divide and conquer just like the megalomaniac you are.
---
The key is to not bring weirdos with you and make a friends list.
---
Okay cool. They're always just soloing it seems
---
So they lock it, but they lock it at a distance at which it really detracts from the game? I don't mind fog, it makes sense that things get harder to see the further away they are. It's just looks like ass when it's as close as it is in WoW classic. 
---
I want to be able to look around while flying for instance, and not get a wall of fog blocking my view.
---
It’s a quest outside the instance as you go to orange side. A dryad gives you a quest to kill the last boss of orange and purple side then turn it in to the Celebras boss at the top of the waterfalls.
---
They probably can, but not very efficiently. Hunters/locks/spriests dot and kite the boss around. So you could but it wouldn’t be fun, lol. As a mage you can at least aoe farm a bunch of locations.
---
i'm talking a general rule of thumb rather than specific sets or their bonuses being good or bad, same deal with if you are rolling on something that is "off spec"
---
"I thought you didn't," says J.A. Brakk "But it was a shit show OBVIOUSLY!" Comes in Taliesin &amp; Eviltel
---
Such is the nature of platitudes.
---
Amazing XD
---
I've played every class to some extent and definitely understand mana usage.    If I pull while the healer is drinking it's because It's an easy pull that won't require them for a while.    I think some people will stop drinking the instant combat starts,  but most will finish their drink and refill mana until they are really needed.
---
It's basically the window where if you engage your energy tick right after. So the best time to start fighting.
---
I’m right there with you man! Keep pushing those good vibes! I love catching all of them in classic!
---
this looks exactly like my Zomboni
---
I think it depends on the level, I'm only level 32 so it's probably easier for me than people your level, less mana starvation and all that.
---
But in the dungeons I've been in, I've rarely needed to drink. I probably go through 3 to 6 waters per dungeon, and I get spirit tap pretty often.
---
Also, ever since my first run in a dungeon where someone said "Mark with a diamond and we'll let you spirit tap."  I'll bring that up for some dungeons, but even then I get enough random spirit taps and my heals are cheap and strong enough it's rarely an issue.
---
On top of that, why drink when you can be doing some damage and still get all your mana back before the 2 easy mobs are dead? They're easy mobs, probably no need to heal, or just one at most before the next pull.
---
I'm not sure, i just followed the article and set it up and it worked but wasn't really playable with the connection i had so after running around for a few minutes i gave up and closed it. I was messing with the control schemes to try and get WASD to work so maybe i triggered something doing that.
---
Anyway, they unbanned my account after my second appeal, I didn't get an answer as to what the specific ban was for so i guess it may not have had anything to do with playing through my phone. Sorry for the false alarm, was just trying to find any explanation for the ban and see if anyone who used the phone method had any problems. Thanks for the reply.

aaaaand now nobody will want to group up with this player anymore. Why people do shitty idiotic moves in classic is beyond me. Everyone can either post a video like in this case or a screenshot and your reputation gets fucked on that server. This isn't retail where you'll never meet the guy you fucked ever again because of the server merging bullshit. Jesus this tank is stupid and he got what he deserves.

Some people would think your gangly ass, dagger ear looking elf is ugly too. :)

Same problem as /r/TIFU and /r/thathappened

I like congratulating pets! My buddy's pet leveled up last night and I said "Grats pet!" in discord, and he replied "He says thanks!"
---
Come join “The Bowling Alley” on Benediction. To be fair still getting signatures on a charter but we’re chill! I swear!
---
People aren't born criminal.
---
If I just levelled a priest to 51, I wouldn't do priest or warlock now. I'd pick something with less wanding, in which case I would try out Druid. I hear they're really efficient with levelling and it would be fun to be able to be any role in dungeons.
---
If there's one thing I've learned from going hardcore in my teens to whatever I'm doing now, it's that these BiS, theorycrafting, optimal build things are a fucking joke unless you desperately care about breakneck progression and "world firsts" which is pretty hilarious seeing as how those happened 15 years ago, but whatever. If you're not going to be on the cutting edge then it really, really does not matter. It's the difference between, like, 1 more auto attack when each mob is done.

Mooncloth bags will be your main profit for a while

I dunno why exactly but this is the comment that's convinced me it's time to hang up the jacket and move on again to other games.
---
I just... that raiding destiny isn't for me. And the only real alternative is PvP and the PvP mode they're deploying is the one where you can NEVER EVER get most of the gear unless you're literally the most hardcore person on the server.
---
How do you fall off of your flight path?
---
Like if wars have 4 passive buffs then they lose their hit rating lolol
---
Yeah a lot of the niceness is fading. It's still there but declining. Like people refusing to group up in quest areas. Or they group up and once they get their items or kills they just leave instead of helping everyone, etc
---
everyone in westfall: can i get a layer invite?

Most likely paid xfers are NEVER gonna happen.

The curve is around 27 for my faction and server.  It was 20.5 last week.
---
Well for trash you keep your dots and curses up on all the targets while cycling in shadowbolts when possible and using shadowburn whenever your shadowbolt crits then back to refreshing dots.
---
My rotation usually looks something like this, curse&gt; corruption&gt; immolate&gt; shadowbolt&gt; tap&gt;shadowbolt&gt; tap&gt; shadowburn/deathcoil&gt; shadowbolt&gt; immolate&gt; corruption. With slight changes depending on fire immunity, shadowbolt crits, and nightfall procs.
---
It's alot more involved then say a frost mage who's rotation is frostbolt&gt;frostbolt&gt;frostbolt.
---
Holy shit that was funny.
---
Sorry, am i missing why meme is in this title?
---
That is why I am honored to be the one to remind them. &gt;:D
---
Hard to say with a company that likes money..
---
Bear tanks are awesome if the party can single target focus. 
---
You always get that one mage that doesn’t understand how hard it can be for bears to wrangle down stray aggro pulls.
---
That's evil. Would Gnomish Mind Control Cap work? Or would it despawn their pet?
---
I think it's kind of lame to have a defacto best in slot pet that you have to camp on server resets in order to attain.
---
&gt; most of us duel wield them ~~for melee combat and~~ for the stats. 
---
Careful. No hunter is pursuing the hit cap for dual wielding.
---
I guess maybe I'm interpreting it wrong, but it sounds to me like the person feels obligated to say something, feels bad if they don't, and just wants to remove themselves from a situation where they feel uncomfortable.
---
Sure it's a little awkward, but I think it's fine to leave if it makes you uncomfortable. Just saying "ignore it" or "you're not obliged" doesn't necessarily internalize as well as one might hope.
---
90, 80 is with PvP rank 3 and honored

Traveling is just so much fun currently.   Me and my buddy were joking about racing from the south of Eastern Kingdoms to the north to see what’s quicker, a flight from Booty Bay to Undercity or taking the boat to Ratchet, flying to Org and then catching the Zep to UC lol
---
Great name for a tank! 
---
Seems like you are getting quote the notorious reputation.
---
Shit I just realized I have a whole prot warrior skillset which hasn't been used in a decade. Even people who have been playing for years might not understand how to tank well in classic yet.
---
But what about World of Fashioncraft though?
---
90
---
Spirit is awesome for warriors for regen while leveling. Out of combat health gained per tick for warriors = Spirit * 0.8 + 6.
---
Flight Paths, 2 being an exaggerated small number, because it seems like you need a connected flight path to get a decent route.
---
Bleeds&gt; stuns vs higher armor. Armor doesn't affect bleed.
---
How’d you piss this guy off? I was a huge dick back in the day of vanilla wow (I was 15) and never got mail bombed.
---
such a good feeling being a healer and having a tank best friend IRL. DPS are a dime a dozen, but we are a needed commodity for dungeons. GL to groups that act salty and petty.
---
I think 30 is fine too because its half way to max (though the true half way mark in terms of total exp is 44)
---
I really don’t know how I’m acting like I know what you want, and none above states I did. It’s a fair amount of content because it was the ENTIRE game at the time, not an expansion.  And it’s the same raids same everything minus a few additions. So yes the amount of original new content is dwarfed by any expansion released since. I’m usually not a grammar nazi but use words correctly like literally and asinine if you intend to argue semantics.
---
Yw, btw how long are the queue times on Stalaag from your experience?

Fck them hordies, thank you for your service good Sir *salute
---
2 bosses that can be easily gotten to (no need to clear any trash) that drop loot with decent vendor values. If you had the gear to kill him before you die, you can include the gator boss as well.
---
Princess also drops a ring that is bis for all melee specs. You can easily sell the ring for 20-30g.
---
Normalized AKA making the game less expansive.
---
Stalagg was and is probably worse than that now that transfers have reopened.
---
Also, if you initiate pvp be prepared for the consequences of doing so.
---
fuck now I cant ever know the secret to making millions I'll be stuck clapping my cheeks on the mailbox in goldshire

I'm already giving into my altoholic ways and I have a lvl 26 mage, 25 druid and 24 priest. And I just started a hunter. I need to pick one but I constantly get itches to play a different class. I'll end up finally reaching 60 in a year but it will be 5 classes at the same time :\
---
Ewwwwwwwwwww rs3
---
Thank you kimd stranger
---
Ya that's horrible advice
---
100% agree, thats why i play both. Cs to tryhard and get better and wow to have a nice relaxing time.
---
Yea, but seeing exactly how that legacy shit caused an issue, and what solution they toss on that pile of abstract cases to deal with bugs, is so fascinating. You know, when you're not the one having to resolve it.
---
When you're the one resolving it and the [WTFs/min](https://i2.wp.com/commadot.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/wtf.png?w=550) hit 1,000 it's a lot less fun, of course.
---
He isn't selling it
---
Only good for soloing as you need the last hit.
---
Can so be good if you have a competent group with good communication and very little dots.  Many people run this way and the group stops attacking so priest can get the bonus to avoid downtime for drinking (speed runs mostly).
---
Quickly quoting Wikipedia here (emphasis mine):
---
&gt;A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or *unexpected result*, or to *behave in unintended ways*.
---
AKA, layering should never have functioned within dungeon instances and it's incredibly doubtful that anybody on Blizzard's team intended for layering to function inside of dungeon instances. Software always works the way it's coded. You're mistaken about what is considered a bug.
---
Not a lot of mail gear for Ele shamans.  Enhancement becomes a meme spec after 40.  You're more valued as a resto/Ele.  Ele is easier to level with, and has good burst damage.

They're all real, they're just taking different things into account.

No Rep Discount, Skill Training AND Mount: 100g
---
Rep Discount, Skill Training AND Mount: 90g
---
For 80g I'm pretty sure they're talking about JUST the mount (riding skill is 20g, mount is 80g with no rep discount).
---
If you are honored the training costs 18g and the mount costs 72g.
---
Total cost is 90g.
---
Tenacious D sung this in my head
---
I feel like borderlands 3 was more of a culling than 30 day sub expiring.  I think people will forget they have auto renew on and will likely stay for the Hallow's end event to kick off and decide then and there if they wanna play until thanksgiving, Christmas or new years.
---
It works until 42... then I would strongly recommend against it, and suggest you start doing uldaman till 43-44. then go to ZF 
---
45 warlock.
---
Warriors are shit in 1v1. They need heals in pvp to be effective, and effectively become the best battlegrounds class.
---
Blizzard fucked the whole thing up by still restricting what servers can transfer where. I don't understand why they won't allow free transfers from ANY full realm to ANY new realm of the same type (pvp, rp, etc) they are not helping the people that got split up because of their horrible launch fiasco.
---
I am noticing the same, 37 priest, actually leveling as holy and after doing Gnomer and RFK a good amount about a week ago, groups needing healers have dried up. Exp in Gnomer and RFK is not great anymore so just world questing.
---
Even SM Gy and Lib groups that I would be fine for seem to have healers locked in. I have to start making my own groups, see if I can get something going. It was nice being an auto pick in lfg for a minute but time to get proactive.
---
How do you do this?
---
Even then I hear it’s one extra attack per 5 attacks? It’s something, but surely not days worth of camping for that something. I’d swing by these spawn religiously when I had a mount to try for this. But I’m not hunter so IDK 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
WE WANT MOAR.
---
Yes, but they can do it in a matter that makes the old gear potentially valid if they want. The removal of resistgear for instance was a mistake. It simplified the game for sure, but resistgear was one of the most important reasons to do Mauradon. So even if people outleveled the dungeon, they kept coming back from time to time to potentially get that resistgear, cause it made certain things easier. It was a luxuary mostly, but an appreciated one.
---
it's TRUE, every single warlock that runs by I inspect and hope! but I'm always disappointed. they need a wizard hat for priest at this level, we have wands and magic too!

That’s what I thought, if I’m going to be doing a lot of healing/ when arena comes out doing 2v2 arenas with a warrior, is there any reason/viability to go 21/0/30?
---
:3
---
You should always pick up resto gear on the side.  Build two sets.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Unbreakable would like a word.
---
Mages that don't offer water are assholes. Healing you need at min a stack of water to be efficient in a dungeon and they cost a couple of silver to get ready. In vanilla when you are struggling to buy spells mages holding back water is the same as not buffing someone.
---
42 pally here, if there is a clothie in the group I don’t roll need on cloth, just feels scummy.. 90% of my gear dropped off the auction house
---
Doesn’t that mean e.g. dungeon/raid bosses critting tanks through absorbs felt undertuned too?
---
"Anyone doing hogger?"
---
Well...someone is.
---
Yes. Without any other talents, you are right. But you are ignoring all other talents which bridge that gap. So at the end of the day, it is not as efficient.

He probably won't get any actual prison time and may get slapped with a fine that he can actually pay.

What time do things like this usually happen? I play on Grobbulus but I’m not PT

&gt;intelligence doesn't matter to me

---
It's the ever present reality of supply differences. 
---
Paladins can wear healing gear of 4 types, giving them way more chances for loot upgrades than cloth wearers.
---
I'm not taking a stance on this issues, I'm done with this debate, but you can't brush aside the reality of the situation; priests get way fewer opportunities for upgrades than paladins do.
---
He blocked it out for his privacy protection, but it means you have a character located on it if it is green.
---
My group was in your shoes last week and we all decided to transfer to Heartseeker from Stalagg, which is the east coast equivalent of your situation.  So far no regrets.
---
Something important to note when making the decision, which also heavily impacted our decision, is the impending phase 2 when layers are removed... which will likely make the situation on larger realms worse.
---
Congrats on reading the first paragraph. Maybe after your next English class you’ll be able to finish the whole post lmaooooooo
---
so I was initially selling them for 30g each down to 25 based of the pricing of mooncloths, but recently they have spike up to over 30g for a cloth. Do I stick with buying and selling at like 35g or am I just at the mercy of those dropping again?
---

---
Back on gorefiend in vanilla we had a guild mage named gucci. I would always ask him to craft a rich purple shirt for my toons lol
---
That Blackcrow crossbow with 1% hit? Need that as a stats stick for tanking... smh. 
---
If a hunter in group needs, I’ll defer
---
Some things like Lupos's shadow damage weren't in the game anymore in 1.12
---
There is no arena in classic.
---
Actually, people have ran the numbers and wf is superior on fast weapons and rockbiter on slow.
---
I'm currently Combat Swords at level 56, but I've been planning on going a more PvP-centered build, that I'd still like to PvE with. What should I be looking at?
---
Google "classic leveling guide &lt;your allegiance&gt;".  Many good guides.  I found I outquest every place I head to though and can't yet go to the next.. at which point WoW Head Classic can give you other zones for your level.
---
You seem a little sensitive so I think you should take your own advice and reroll on a PVE server.
---
This is the evilest thing I’ve read on Reddit. Ever.
---
Yes, but a total pushover. Think he was level 41 and had 2 300 health or something, I was 43 at the time.
---
Sounds like our experiences were different then. All I can say is that I know Kant people feel similarly to myself and the others in this thread.
---
So you have nothing to say? Got it.
---
Usually in the top guilds one of the healers just specs deep enough into shadow to get weaving, uses 5 shadowspells at the start of the fight and then goes back to healing.
---
Not only did this not need a video, why is there super depressing music in the background with it?  Lol
---
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
---
yeah me too! like The Bridge of Khazad-dûm :D
---
why is this tagged ‘Humor’? i thought it wasn’t a real bug u til i read all the comments
---
i will :D
---
There's actually another bug right now with shields. When fire ward is taken down with a crit spell it will remove **ALL** shields currently on your character.
---
Haven't tested with ice ward yet.
---
I wish we could see the queue numbers and times for each server so we had an idea of what we are waiting for until phase 2 comes around.  Or at least end layering and keep phase 1.
---
Holy crap its been along time since i saw that ui.
---
If your plan with this post was to make me feel sad for you, it worked
---
When do I cast tremor totem to not be out of range when it pulses
---
I'm only on a PvP server because all of my friends are on them, I've not once seen the mythical "quality PvP" that everyone talks about. Before I server transferred it was just constantly getting stomped by level ?? hordies and corpse camped on top of my perpetually dead quest givers. Oh, and my quest hubs being raided and occupied by 20-30 man raid teams of griefers, keeping me from even taking a flight path away from the dumpster fire they've made.
---
I know he wasn’t, just hurts to see primarily  Druid/rogue gear go to hunters that only melee half of their fights... but we gotta he fair ig :/
---
There is no fear in retail. You can toggle PVP, solo elites 3 levels higher than you whole taking zero damage, etc.
---
Unless a specific piece was reserved, there's absolutely nothing wrong with rolling need on something you'll use on that toon, even if it's not for "your role" pre-50. Getting upset over something that will only be worn for 10 hours by either person is pointless.
---
If you don't want an enh shaman or feral druid rolling on non-healer items, then don't invite them and accept that your attitude is causing you to wait longer for a healer.
---
That's how you view that?  I was sitting here thinking, "as a professional, he probably could have worded that a whole lot differently."  That's even assuming he said it that way, which apparently others aid he didn't.  
---
I'm a professional who retired and then unretired out of boredom. 
---
 This shit doesn't offend me.  Far from it.
---
The cloth piece he needed on was healing / damage increase piece.  I just feel like it's unfair that the pali can roll on a lot more gear than I can.  I'm not goign to be needing on anything except cloth.  This guy need rolled on pretty much every drop in the dungeon.  I get that he needs it too but it just feels unfair.   This pali walked out the dungeon with two new blue pieces and i got jack shit
---
Your moment of fame and glory! :D
---
what exactly needs fixing?
---
Nobody in the right mind will take a stat stick dagger from a rogue. I'm not brain dead, in this case I lost a stat stick dagger to a gnome mage. Why? because 'fk hunters'
---
Well for one, they'll (Alliance) only attack you if they got a 4-1 number advantage.
---
what are you basing that curve comment off of? I would love to see that, my buddy was complaining that 60 is the new norm and I believe what you said sounds more accurate. 
---
I can't just say "some guy on Reddit said it" so I would love to see the article/chart you are referencing
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/itwasagraveyardgraph/
---
The problem is that with layering you cant keep track of Broken Tooth's respawn time since there is multiples of him on multiple layers. You cannot consistently rejoin the same layer (after logging out) where you know when he was killed/tamed.
---
How do you have feralas fp and gadgetzan but not the 1k needles one?!
---
:D
---
I mean I have seen nothing but overwhelming support from the vast majority for paid transfers to come in. 🤷‍♂️
---
Damn, I was embarrassed cause this is my server and faction. I'm actually really hoping it isn't going to be like this when I end up raiding for the first time next week.
---
Fuck. Out here looking like Patrick Star
---
That's pretty much the vanilla experience. From there out you just grind.
---
Not gonna lie. That's an awesome video.
---
Fun thing: none of those names is me.
---
Hazard - Blameaux US
---
I think it's people who finish their zone/get to red quests only in their zone and grind it out instead of moving from Tanaris to Feralas to Dustwallow, etc.
---
How do you see faction average of a server?
---
As a mage, you should not be pulling more than one unless you are AOE farming, at which point you can start to do that around when you get full improved blizzard (which is in the 20's), and it really takes off with ice barrier and a mount at lvl 40.
---
Ya but is the horde to alliance ratio very bad
---
I like shirts. They're comfy and easy to wear.
---
This is hilarious.
---
This guy has the right outlook
---
That's a great compliment! &lt;3
---
May check it out, I like building from the ground up with guilds. Currently on a high pop pvp server so I might be able to get a free transfer. Thanks for the offer :)
---
He's arriving into BB, so not really anymore
---
Check out each classes guide on wowhead classic, each guide will give you a breakdown of stat priority
---
Yes. You also get reduced xp for mobs being different levels so you can't abuse having someone kill higher level mobs for you.
---
Yeah sorry im New so i havent done that dungeon so im obviously out of the loop when it came To that.
---
Because I am alliance
---
Engineering is the best profession in the game.  When zg comes out you will also want tailoring for the bloodvine set bonus.
---
Honestly this is myself as well. Never played WoW and literally have no desire to play retail.
---
But I'm completely hooked on classic.
---
Frost nova, move away, focus fire.
---
But at lvl 15, I can't remember there being any pack that is automatically a 4pull no matter what.
---
Sounds like the horde on sulfuras!
---
Never happened to me but back in the day, sometimes the horde zeppelins would sometimes drop you.
---
It would've been nice if he did this.  He was tanking.  it just feels unfair that they can need roll on all my cloth drops that involve healing and i can't need on anything except cloth.  He walked out the dungeon with 2 new blues and i got nothing :(
---
I mean I agree with the guy but reporting and having a big whinge about it is actually cringey..
---
Haha no worries mate, I expect it on a PvP server.
---
I don't enjoy pvp any less as a human. It's annoying to deal with undead but most horde are not undead honestly it's just a minor annoyance.
---
Once they get within range to see you, your stealth has no benefit other than letting you use your openers. You're treated on their screen like you're unstealthed. The transparent effect is just what stealth shows up as visually.
---
Same level people can see you if you're close by unless you're heavily talented into MoD.

BENEDICTION SERVER
---
&lt;Storm&gt; is recruiting all makes and models for server progression. We are a 130+ member community-driven 15-year running vanilla WoW raid guild from Firetree. Join as we level to 60, Raid &amp; Dungeon, PVP, and stream live as we progress through end-game content.
---
There's a census on wowhead for classic.
---
I am just making balance assumptions based on pservers
---
And the complaints are that this is not working as it used to.
---
I distinctly remember kiting warrior and hitting 1 butting to FD and drop a trap while running. It would cause me to FD then immediately stand up and drop a trap all in less than a second.
---
How is a hunter supposed to FD freeze trap a rogue who is actively chasing them in melee range if they need to stop moving, fd, wait, trap, then continue kiting.
---
It used to be an instant 1 button drop trap instantly macro and it needs to be reverted to that.
---
Lvl 60 mage and 45 water is the worst, you have to drink 2 to fully mana up :(
---
hahaha, how troggs keep it cold is a mystery :O
---
OP said it only happens on PW:S, Ice barrier, mana shield, void sac, etc are all working as intended
---
you might get a more regular damage output, that's slightly higher on average - but in classic burst is king.
---
Sure, just try to avoid Milton on your way in.
---
&gt;nothing to say
---
Never understood anyone getting butt hurt about gear they will out level in 3 hours
---
If your bad sure. If your good your rotation looks something like this
---
curse&gt; corruption&gt; immolate&gt; shadowbolt&gt; tap&gt;shadowbolt&gt; tap&gt; shadowburn/deathcoil&gt; shadowbolt&gt; immolate&gt; corruption&gt; shadowbolt etc.
---
I didn't get a hostile vibe from him, but I am getting one from you lol. I see you're very aptly named.
---
It's kinda fun being a "no name" character whose working their way up through the ranks again.
---
By the time you're in BFA, you've already single-handedly saved the world countless times, and no mortal creature is really a challenge anymore.
---
?????
---
*Fist bump for my fellow jack of all trades*
---
So with 305 weapon skill, more than 6% hit is useless? For 2h only? Or dw as well?
---
Thats fair. Never hunted in vanilla but remember that happening to me as a rogue.
---
Pls explain to a fellow moo brethren
---
Oo that's nice too. Didn't know
---
We are talking about an already full raid group and the "carry classes" that aren't even 60 in the guild talking like they are going to replace someone the moment they hit 60...
---
The subject is random people in guilds expecting to be included in an already full raid group, with the added absurdity that they are a known "carry" class and think they are entitled to a raid spot in a full raid group
---
dude the first time I ever pvp'd as a frost mage versus a frost mage that was good, I learned all about counterspell, baiting abilities to use said counterspell and just some all around basic but maybe not so obvious stuff for mage v mage pvp my mind was blown. Felt like such an idiot not knowing how to use counterspell properly, it actually got my excited to relearn how to play. This probably sounds super stupid but a well timed interupt and actually learning how to do it against the right school of magic lit a new fire underneath me for pvp as mage. This was ages ago though, but I'll never forget gettting completely shut down by an equal level mage and realizing I had no idea how to play that class and began learning the real way.
---
I have no idea why I just typed this all out to you, i'm sorry hahaha
---
Lol! Ye
---
It goes way before that.
---
There is a kickback after casting that prevents mana regen but iirc that kickback only comes into play after a certain cast time and pallys standard heal comes under that threshold so spirit is very useful for them.
---
Oh, so you're using your celebrity status to turn a one-time issue into a life-ruining consequence?
---
Lol
---
No idea.
---
It's what they said they're going to do and they seem to be holding to it. Whether it means opening more servers and allowing free character migrations or what, I don't know.
---
You’re better off running and taking Rez sickness from the GY and running for a couple minutes to the fp. That’s your fastest route. But if you don’t mind the flight time...
---
Its exactly 7 hours. So when you have five layers on a server with 5 different timers running you never know when to expect it since you cant consistently rejoin the same layer when logging off.
---
I'll quietly raise my hand and mention I'm okay with all the MTX in retail except boosts. I like fun pets and mounts and don't mind forking over for cosmetics.
---
1 bubble per 10 hours, so if you played 4 hours per day, you would get 2 bubbles between log ins. 
---
So yes, you would be right around a level and a half of extra rested xp. I ran out of quests at level 58, so it lines up with my experience.  I only did 1 ZF run my entire journey to 60, just to put in more context.  
---
There are a lot of factors, everyone's trip to 60 will be different.
---
That was amazing lol
---
thing is every AoE spot is extremely contested, so it’s not very practical unless you’re the first there and people don’t want to contest you
---
But then you'd have to level your pet 23 levels though. And that means killing mobs around your pets level. And your pets xp bar is a quarter of yours and only increase when killing stuff.  
---
Leveling up a low level pet fucking sucks.
---
That 15 minutes could have been 8 mobs instead of 2, if you're just competing for spawns as they pop up. Yeah, if I spend an hour there, I will eventually get the mobs but doing quick math, I usually find I'll get more XP than turning in the quest if I just wandered and grind undesirable mobs or find a guild group to run a dungeon with. 
---
Anyway, it's kind of silly conversation because we both have different preferences and circumstances. Grinding a dungeon with guildies you've grouped with buncha times before is certainly different than trying to even just run through a dungeon once with pubbies. The math of waiting for pubbies who don't start travelling until everyone else is there is pretty bad haha
---
Wow, that shitty sportmanship and all around ass holery.
---
&gt; rogue gear
---
It's not rogue gear, it's leather gear.
---
And we found the friend, that was easy. Also stfu, I’ve got my answer pussy
---
Never played rogue but every other melee class I've played starts auto-attacking whenever you use a melee ability. It's the default behavior, no macro needed.
---
Going with the powerful stuff, here.
---
Horde:
---
* 30% stun resistance.
---
* Blood Fury.
---
* Increased pet damage.
---
* Will of the Forsaken.
---
* Shaman totems.
---
* War Stomp.
---
Alliance:
---
* Fear Ward.
---
* Stoneform.
---
* Escape Artist.
---
* Perception.
---
* Paladin Buffs.
---
Horde is pretty stacked if most of them pick Orc.
---
I just actually shivered...hellooooo wasted time
---
Hand of Justice dropped for my group last night and the rogue was excited. Tank won the roll :\^)
---
Gracias. I'd have to reroll as I'm currently alliance but I muuuch prefer horde so thats a definite possibility.
---
These guys are hardcore powergamers and assholes who were shaming me over taking my time and enjoying the ride, so I'm definitely not looking for pro leet gamer types. I'll be in touch!

100% i did most of STV at 3-7am it's literally night and day. goes from vietnam to a peaceful safari expedition. only had 2-3 fights over the 2 nights i did this, and there was absolutely no competition for any of the kill quests. the people in chat are a lot more chill and civil too.
---
I came here expecting to agree with you... But honestly that really is low-effort. You should be embarrassed it took you over an hour to make that. You're never getting that time back.
---
&gt;Huh, it seems like quite a few people are okay with using bugs. Who would have thought?
---
Yup, they are. Any advantage they can get. It's only torches and pitchforks when they personally didn't get to abuse the bug.
---
Honestly the cheapest Asus laptop they have on that site should play WoW like a champ, the requirements are easily met by almost anything. The other games I don't play so I don't know their requirements.  
---
Personally I'd spend the extra few hundred and get the cheapest Intel based Asus they have, looks like the ROG STRIX HERO II GL504GM-XS74 is on sale right now for a reasonable price. That laptop is about as strong as my desktop, which plays classic at maxed settings and easily hits 100fps.  Finally, that laptop has a much strong CPU than your desktop and a video card that's only slightly weaker, it could replace your desktop.
---
Hello fellow Draenor citizen! I loved that guy. Never bought his stuff, but it was something about the server that i always found nice, like it gave the server character.

My guild decided to hold our ground and stick to Stalagg despite 5+ hour queues during most times of day for the first few weeks.  It's at a point where I either get right in or sit in queue for a max of 30 minutes. Glad I stayed
---
Interesting. As priest I buff everything I see. Orcs trees, rocks? Buffed. Druids buff back, and other classes /ty or /wave but mages just ignore me.
---
Find a cave with strong WiFi nearby. Problem solved.
---
Lol I know you. Honestly I was pretty shocked of how kinda slow you are, in the interesting kinda way. 
---
Also the type of people to make reddit posts about bans and suspensions besides messaging the company. 
---
You were suspended because you were exploiting a temporary bug in the game.
---
You're probably a dick if this is happening to you regularly lol.
---
Uh... keep leveling m8, 19 more levels to go.
---
That's fine by me. Power word shield op.
---
Haha good point, now I’m gonna say  ding at 30 and 44 lol
---
Who was healing, you or the pally? If it was the pally he had every right to roll on healing gear, that's how gear works in Classic.
---
If you were the one healing then I agree it was bad.
---
Blizzard does NOT have anything with Ragnaros trademarked or patented. That has been a name used for fire elementals and other fantasy games for decades. Well before Blizzard ever even started make games.
---
Also you are free to interpret ART in anyway you choose. This is based on law and its why things like South Park and Robot chicken can get away with using doing what they do. He can say its based on a Wow character or not but he is free to make a model and sell it as long as the actual  file/items did not come from Blizzard or the creator has no stated they do not want it sold.
---
Delete this post and read the community info on the subreddit.
---
I used to say SoE was the best since you were killing things faster, but stoneskin is really good at damage mitigation and it is probably the one I will play now.  Exceptions can be made on group comp and how recently you have trained each skill.
---
catch up on your sleep
---
After this weekend all the new realms will be a healthy amount higher than the highest vanilla server, including arcanite reaper which I believe was/is the lowest population.
---
Fake. That's way too much words from a warrior.
---
Everytime I log in I get unsolicited whispers asking to tank dungeons from people I've grouped with. I usually say yes if I have time, however I almost feel bad because I've never felt the desire to add any of them to my friends list as well, lol.
---
FYI: When a warrior or rogue clicks need on a ranged weapon, don't give him/her verbal abuse
---
You need to keep that gear til Halloween is over
---
To be fair, I have 200g at 55 as a rogue and I don't farm anything, I just quest.
---
Same here, no need to accidentally put a higher rank on my action bar.
---
Not sure why you lawled at this.  In the past excessive corpse camping has been considered targeted harassment.  Blizzard has given out suspensions over graveyard camping.  Pretty sure there were guilds that saw tons of their members banned for doing this when the honor system originally released.
---
Your pet has its own xp bar, a quarter-lenght of yours. If you tame a level 10 pet, you'll have to level him up killing mobs around his level.
---
Barcelona?
---
Drain tank takes imp drain life and uses a succubus to attack while you dot then drain and facetank till the mob dies. It's not a bad build and definitely can work well but in my experience you don't kill things as fast and you have to eat/drink much more frequently while also needing to be at higher hp and Mana to engage mobs then a non drain tank build.
---
WoW is such a dumb fucking game.  I cant believe I paid money for this garbage.
---
As a fellow spriest, I regret not starting in Mulgore D:
---
At 54 you can start doing BRD touch rooms and you will hit 60 almost instantly.
---
Until 54 do quests, it's not that hard. IF you are getting 20k exp an hour while questing I would suggest learning to play instead of abusing dungeons to hit 60 and then be useless.
---
Shhhhh, dont tell them our secret!
---
Very long time indeed, I'm 60 and still using Hypnotic blade (until Gandling drops me a Witchblade that is.)
---
Rerolling to Paladin.
---
Torch of holy flame. Lvl 30ish offhand. 40yd pull.
---
Try checking out the discord channels or find a guild through the forums. Could be a lot more fun and pop won’t be as much of a factor if you find a good group of people to play with.
---
Depends who I am grouped with. If it doesn't really matter, I'll need it if it upgrades me. Otherwise I ask if they are ok with me needing it.
---
Only pvp melee crits or from monsters too?
---
Honesty: 300 \*\*
---
And priests are still the better class. If it means so much to you roll pally.
---
I have never leveled fishing past like 10, so sorry if this is dumb as fuck, but what is in the box?! I need to know
---
On the other hand, people can bring up the issues the group is having without being a complete asshole.
---
Agree, I don't want 50yrd but let me at least see them within my own range.
---
Hope this will be look someday.
---
it is fake if u look at the character models u can clearly see those arent the same as classic + there is a calendar on the minimap so im assuming its BFA
---
more likely to be a dispicable me meme
---
Dude's a modern day Jesus, getting locked up so that millions could go outside
---
Don't go to an AoE farm area - just go find an area with plenty of mobs that you might have to move around between.  Hopefully you can find one that is humanoid and drops a ton of cloth, some green/blues and greys hopefully.
---
Just throw on a good playlist and start killing things for a few hours until you get bored and keep turning stuff in... you'll be getting XP and increasing your gold.
---
As a healer, I appreciate mages like you.  Some are so fuckin' skimpy on the water it pisses me off.  
---
That shit is expensive (average 40-50 water per run = over 3g), and if we are doing a fast-paced dungeon, I'm not going to waste my money to drink up 30% of my mana between pulls, I'll wait until I'm oom.

Classic's approach to totems is place and forget (aside from Searing aggroing enemies through walls), retail's more reactionary. Both fit within gameplay of respective games and both have some skill requirement. Though in the case of classic, it mostly comes from totem twisting. Very interesting style of play, but still rarely worth it to bring dedicated enhancement to raids.

It’s okay man, we are humans after all
---
It *seems* confusing at first because it has so many capabilities, but something simple like that should be pretty easy to set up. I cant really look into it right now but [here's a thread that confirms its possible and might be useful](https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2039497-Weak-Aura-that-sends-chat-message)
---
Yeah, mages can be harsh with their low CD on blink. Crippling poison is a must and keep in mind it gets better at high level. 50% slow for the first crippling poison, 70% slow for the highest crippling poison. Besides that you can try to get a lucky gouge in whilst predicting their blink. If you gouge as they blink, they end up gouged at the location they blinked towards.
---
Perfect targets for pubbie tears.
---
Let’s just say he did not like to use markers.
---
What if they explicitly like rolling on cloth cause A) its been the norm since Vanilla and B) seeing people kick a fuss over something thats been the standard is hilarious.

I wouldn’t go out of my way to piss people off but knowing this is how its always been just adds that extra zest. I’d have no doubt in my mind the rager is just some dumbass which takes away any sympathy / compassion the situation merits.
---
Maybe for pve but I think daggers are the pvp weapon of choice.  Also when you gearing up you probably just use the weapon with the highest dps regardless of what type it is.
---
A bunch of people will be 60 with 250-400g from their BiS grind, but "continue to farm dungeons for another 100+ hours" isn't really what they want to here when they're asking for making money @60.
---
“ LOOK AT ME RFC IS SUPER EASY CHEESY IM A WOW GOD “
---
Sure, as long as you're ok with knowing that all you're doing is racing towards a server pop that is overpopulated with other mages and priests who are all going to be competing for the same raid/dungeon slots at 60.
---
I honestly don't know why anyone in their right mind is bothering to do this anymore, literally half of all lvl 60 toons are mages.
---
I wonder where we could post to let Blizz know of the issue.
---
The biggest threat to rogues is other rogues, warriors, and mages. Wotf helps slightly with warriors and not at all with rogues and mages, while stun resist helps with all three.
---
Warlocks and priests simply aren't a threat to rogues. If the rogue is losing the fight, he can just blind and sprint away to reset the fight and try again. There's nothing a warlock or priest can do to stop that.
---
Follow Joanna’s guide.   There’s no shortage of quests until you are 58+.   At 55, you can start MC/Ony attunements.  As a mage, you also need items from BRD.   Then move onto LBRS and from 58-60 you should exclusively be doing Scholomance, Strath etc.  
---
I dinged 60 with over half pre-raid BIS as a hunter and I was doing more dps than lvl 60s at 58.    Last 2 levels took upwards of 7 hours due to forming groups and still made 1-60 in just over 6 days.  
---
There’s no point grinding to 60 then running instances that would have given you exp as well as loot.
---
Haha I actually meant details!! I edited my comment
---
Guild officers and founders are often some of the most egotistical mother fuckers you'll meet in game.  Idk if its compensation for a lackluster life, or a continuation of their importance in real life, but damn if it isn't true.  So I'd believe it.
---
You gonna re roll?
---
It sad that this was my first thought? "why don't you just run to a spirit healer, take gear off and die?". I guess that's not a thought a lot of people just instantly think but #warriorlife.
---
It's really more about the revenue loss from the disruptions and blizzard wanting people to be scared to do it.
---
This week I inherited some code with 10,000 lines of legacy code. This code had 2 dependencies and they wanted me to make it function with only 1. Took a full week of dredging the code only to realize 1 dependency was virtually unnecessary, and deleting 1 line of code completely removed that dependency with no side effects.
---
Just make your own groups man. It'll get done so much quicker than just sitting there spamming /LFG
---
That’s because Uldaman is a harder dungeon compared to other dungeons. Has nothing to with the average level. Forgot the website but someone mentioned the average to be mid 30s now.
---
tank can easily do torch room at 53... cause you aren't really even tanking in there
---
Only problem with dodge, is when you are stunned from a tidal charm, MM hunter, fire mage, shadow priest, druid, rogue, warrior or paladin, you cannot dodge.  In that respect, I too would go for more damage to get the kill before the enemy deletes the non shield wearing shaman first.
---
Did he really ninja ironfoe??? You gotta be kidding
---
I was in a similar position last night, except I was the underlevelled one and he picked the first fight. I just needed 2 quest drops, and this guy was not letting me have them. But I fought, everytime I saw him (or he saw me) and even though I only won like, 1/10, when he was oom from farming the elementals I needed, it felt good. Then a druid showed up and 2 shot him a bunch of times and I got to finish my quest :). Always fight the horde, no matter how futile. They will pay with their time, if nothing else.
---
Once you get windfury totem, you can favor stoneskin a bit more. I like it when I'm healing since the mitigation can cause me to heal less and save mana. Especially on big packs. 
---
It depends on the tank really. If you or the healer aren't having a hard time healing, strength of earth will make everything even faster.
---
Brah, that horse charge.
---
Your racial (305 wep skill instead of 300) means that your hitcap for *yellow* attacks is 6% instead of 9%. 
---
As for white attacks (melee swings), the hitcap for 2h is the same as yellow attacks (aka abilities). The hitcap for dualwield white swings is much higher but it doesn’t matter as much.
---
aoe farming out in the world is completely unviable on a popular server.  Any place that's even decently good for it will have 10+ other mages there farming.
---
Because in a lot of cases healing leather sucks ass and cloth pieces are BIS.
---
How much to purchase?
---
Bis is bis man. Roll away. I'll get my leaf soon anyway!
---
Yeah you would, but if there wasn't severe punishments for people holding society back single handedly, then that shit would happen all the time.
---
My city has problems every once in a while with people stealing copper lines from the train lines. That might seem like a small crime, but when they do it it delays many trains, tens of thousands of people are late for work and it cost society millions of euro to not only hold the trains, but also in lost productivity.
---
he couldn't do it alone or he would have... never trust a human with their beady little eyes
---
All stuns have a base 5% chance to be resisted, orc racial adds an additional 25%. Its 1/3
---
You need to use a castsequence macro for it to work reliable, even with auto loot. Otherwise it wont always work.
---
Totally depends on the group. Make your loot rules clear before you start groups. (Another reason i always form my own groups or run with people i know)
---
I have a macro for groups thats pretty much "If you plan to equip it roll need. If you plan to vendor/AH it roll greed. If youre running for a specific BiS piece let us know now. We dont have your class's BiS list memorized." 
---
That way if theres a rogue looking for X dagger you know in advance to let him have it and vise versa if theres a bow you want to reserve. Also allows people to see if they have any loot competition before we start to avoid disputes later. Saves alot of salt.
---
This one has the fastest attack speed.  I believe that's so desirable for PvP and caster interruption.  Otherwise I'm also not sure what the big deal is, other than "Best in Slot" for a pet.
---
Combat/hemo is pretty popular for PvP, but my preference has always been cold blood daggers - it's a lot more gear dependent, but those juicy crits melt cloth in PvP. Combat/swords will almost always be the best for PvE until later phases, but the specs for combat PvP and combat PvE are different. Ultimately it's gonna come down to your preference. I'd say the most well-balanced spec for both PvP and PvE would be combat. You still have room to grab Improved Sprint and Endurance, but you're bottlenecked by adrenaline rush's 5 min cd.
---
Attack speed has no impact on DPS^[source](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php), it's simply the pushback people care about. Also, Lupos lost the shadow damage in 1.9, so that doesn't apply to Clasic unfortunately.
---
I *have* heard that wolves are better for raids, but a fast attack speed is better for solo'ing, since they're usually able to hold aggro easier.
---
Fuck Hillsbrad. And Alterac for that matter.
---
This is a great and simple addon. One feature that would be nice would be a slider of opacity. Keep up the good work!
---
Leather, Bolts of Cloth, Greens!
---
I have this macro for all my stealth openers. It does work, you just have to make sure you stand still when you do it otherwise it wont work.
---
I hope that answer is to stay on your shitty overpopulated realm lol. You're so easily triggered its actually hilarious.
---
auto attack normally only starts if you successfully use a melee ability. /startattack macros toggle on auto attack no matter what.
---
Atm I have a mage on skeram with my ui serup.
---
Ima reroll but I am visiting constantly to craft stuff for the ah and see if more 50+ get going..
---
Well, you were in the Barrens. It is very populated, and people talk in /1 all the time to make the long runs bearable.
---
this hits home so hard it crit me
---
Well yeah, if you like Healing more than Damage, you spec deeper into Restoration. Then again, if you do that, might as well put points in Enhancement for utility, because without Lightning Mastery, you won't be casting Lightning spells a lot...
---
Basically, your non-instant offensive spells all take 1s longer to cast, crit for much less and have a much shorter range, just so your heals can be 10% stronger with up to another 18% for Healing Wave. Not really a good trade, which is why 30/0/21 is the cookie-cutter spec.
---
If you really want 30 in Resto, might as well grab Ancestral Knowledge, Shield Spec., Imp. Ghost Wolf, and Guardian Totems from enhance and Convection and Earth's Grasp from Elemental for an ultra defensive Healer spec.
---
You may not understand it, but that doesn't make him wrong.
---
Mp5 and Hp5 are great stats for leveling, life tap or not. Intellect is not a priority for a leveling warlock. Definitely not over Spirit. +damage is the best, but Spirit is second.
---
&gt;he can need roll on all *my* cloth drops
---
This right here is the kind of mindset that gets you nowhere in Classic.
---
same thing happens to me maybe every 6th or 7th time I use it
---
Aw I miss Lotrmush, different thing.
---
I found a double arcane crystal vein last night
---
Felt fucking good
---
I thought they were going to be introducing the later AV?
---
This is funny because, as an arms warrior, I remember smashing on priests for 2 or 3 melees a few lower levels than me and then getting an 800dmg crit with Mortal Strike, only to have the shield stay up. (This is in the lvl 40s by the way)
---
It didnt even phase me, I remember just shrugging thinking "Huh, that's a big shield." Now that I think back on it, I find myself going "Wait yeah what the fuck that absorbed 2k dmg! That's completely broken!"
---
It’s more about the bosses after that room
---
You can get down when Cata comes!
---
I went from 52 to 60 in a week just doing dungeon exp runs.
---
You must not have been around kn the old days when wai amd secret feature were around. Long story short the devs didn't know every interaction in the game and how they would play out. Lots of things that were undocumented ended up being considered working as intend and became features
---
How the hell do bugs like this end up in classic when they werent there original ?Wth blizzard
---
And ofc everything depending on group.
---
I have multiple max levels of both on retail and still didn't know this lol
---
Will of the forsaken is the most overpowered PvP horde racial by miles. Anyone that has competed at gladiator level in arena knows this. In most cases, it is a second trinket dispel cc on a separate cooldown, meaning you have one minute to kill them after forcing them to trinket and blow cooldowns. All other races on both sides had two minutes to kill them after trinket. 
---
Unbelievably overpowered and it remained so for years. 
---
It belongs at the top of the list for this reason, overwhelming PvP advantage. Anyone can look at old glad brackets with things like priest, mage, rogue,PMR. An undead version of this team would have double the chance to win against a human counterpart, at same skill level, for nothing other than race.
---
Enh is good for making 5min highlights of oneshotting people out of hours and hours of actual gameplay.
---
This is freaking amazing!!! I want to put it as my wall paper lol
---
Op is looking for a relation between the multiple damage increasing stats, yes obviously 1% hit is better than 1 sp, but at what point do they become equal is key.
---
As others noted, if it's past 50 then yes because pally is next to useless for anything other than Holy at 60 in PvE.
---
"BUT RET CAN DPS AND PROVIDE BUFFS!" Yeah you're right, but a Holy pally can heal and provide those buffs too and won't end up lowering the average DPS of the raid by showing up.
---
I'm happy that I was able to purchase my mount at exactly 40. That was my main goal in the game. I saw a lot of my guildies not getting their mounts until mid-40s, and I didn't want that to be me. I even had some gold left over. I did it by following this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbRXBu1PSPA
---
Yes, I did almost exclusively mob grinding. I have Skinning and Mining, and vendored almost everything I farmed. I only trained essential skills and never bought any food, except from Mages a few times. I sold a few things on the AH, but it was less than 10 gold total. I also wasted a lot of gold by re-speccing I think 3 times.
---
My /played is pretty high for only being level 40, as you can see, but I have spent a lot of time afk in game, as well as working on fishing and cooking. I also PvP everytime I see an Ally, and spend a fair amount of time dying as a result. I also have been leveling as sub-optimal specs (Ambush, Hemo, Backstab, always daggers). Obviously I'm not the most efficient leveler, but I've had a lot of fun playing the game so far, and am thrilled that I have my mount at exactly 40.
---
Good luck on your journey, guys!
---
That makes sense
---
I was going to do this but the guy came back from being afk
---
You can farm the 3k to get it in 30 minutes of legacy raid farming. 310 is trivially cheap.
---
Looking back on it I should have done this. I didn’t know the tank was being malicious or I would have created some chaos. I thought it was an accident. That’s why I didn’t start getting mad until after I had been ported back to town.
---
Reminds me of some code I inherited this week. The previous dev used variables like "mapConIDvsOppRECvsFirmEx" and it was a map whose keys were a concatenation of values in 3 other maps which themselves used keys that were concatenations of multiple values.
---
You already have Q and Z by using the default movement keys, you're only gaining W and A by swapping keybinds to ESDF
---
I made a macro for that. Used quite frequently
---
&gt; Nothing to lose. 
---
Except hours of play time as you wait in the queue.
---
Using searing pain as you would for threat. Against a single target you would only get push nack if you mistime casts or its one of the few bosses that has faster than 1.5 attack time. Can't aoe tank but single target pushback is not an issue
---
I love all cereal I must be the biggest og of them all
---
Sometimes context is everything, he could have requested for people to update the batch and nobody did it for that 6 years. Now someone's doing it and of course he's gonna be a little sassy. At least, working in the field you can come into those cases quite often messing with ancient code.
---
And what did you use Engi for aside of PvP?
---
That's less a "good tank" and more a "geared tank."
---
Hell, if there's enough AoE even a geared tank should need lots of healing just because they know how much they can pull to make sure DPS can AoE it down before healer's mana runs out.
---
Be glad your GM is going to be main tank.
---
You do NOT want a main tank that isn't GM or friends with the GM, they can leave the guild for another one at a moments notice and ruin the guild because they get priority on almost every warrior item they need.
---
Full song collab plz
---
I was just copying the spelling from the thread title, I have no clue how to properly spell it.
---
I maintain part of a codebase that dates back to the time of the original WoW release.  This is scary accurate.
---
can tank the entire dungeon at 53, thunderclap/demo emp and its fucking ez mode
---
No, it's only for one week
---
Well, if you read the article, it also talks about a decrease in Wailing Caverns guide traffic, so I'd say it's at least a decent metric to go by.
---
If you have a source that says differently, I'd genuinely love to see it! :)
---
Awesome, this is precisely the sort of thing I was looking for, thank you!
---
Every marginal advantage you can get in PvP is worth it.
---
I think running would be quicker
---
I'm doing that on my priest, that'll be the alt I use when I want a break from the lock.
---
CC isn't dramatically different in vanilla 1.12 then how it was in vanilla. The chance of poly lasting even 20 seconds in pvp in vanilla is less than 1%.
---
Hey, the broken offhand is not OP anymore, WTF blizzard, nochanges!
---
You can use goblin items with gnomish engineering.  You just can't make them
---
They are, it's not like hunters are given strikers marks. There aren't many good ranged weapons for melee. Bis is bis. Upgrades are upgrades. Now if an idiot hunter takes like felstriker, that's different. You better believe I'm rolling on dalrends and core hound tooths. You can roll on blackcrow. I'll get my leaf sooner than later.
---
So in other words, yes?
---
I'm a Shaman Tank right now. I've gotten some of the coolest compliments. Stay tankin buddies, it's worth it.
---
meh one mob won't ruin the day if the dps know to run the mob to the spinning tank
---
Boddicker?
---
I think you're being unfair. A hybrid class is supposed to be a jack of all trades. If they can only roll on gear for one spec per dungeon run, it will take them three times as long to be equally effective at their class role as it would a single-function class. Hybrid classes are *already* punished for their flexibility by being significantly less effective at any given task. Should they really be worse at everything AND take three time as long to gear? To me, it seems reasonable for every class to require roughly the same amount of effort to get their class to a given level, and for Hybrid classes, that means rolling on three sets of gear. A Hybrid with purple DPS gear and green healing gear cannot play as a hybrid.
---
Also, the world is bigger in Classic. No expansion has even come close to matching the land mass that was released with Vanilla Wow.
---
In early Classic WoW you only got the soulshard if Drain Soul itself did the killing damage to the creature. So your own DoTs or pets would stop you farming them. Forget about trying to get any during a group or raid.
---
One easy way to "fix" this would, of course, involve changes.
---
But increase how many can be max rank at the same time. And then maybe not count those that have already reached it for the next week. Which would suck, unless they stayed at max rank, but then there would be no point in the system eventually...
---
Its pretty hard to fix besides just increasing the cap of how many R14 there can be at the same time.
---
It seems pretty consistent that bug/defect generally refers to anything that prevents software from meeting the original specifications/requirements, whether that be performance issues, bad programming logic, or even straight up errors being thrown.
---
So in this case, it's likely a bug but Blizzard would be the ones who could classify it as they would be the ones writing up the specifications and requirements for the product.
---
Honestly, I had not even considered doing this. I had been solely running Imp for the stam buff, should I be forgoing the imp and just using VW on passive? I feel like dancing between imp and VW just for large packs is going to create a large amount of downtime between pulls.
---
Grinding on mobs that are green, and doing quests that are green are going to increase your efficiency in terms of experience gained per hour. The biggest reason is because that you take less damage, but more importantly you kill so much faster. This is because your stats such as crit, and the rate at which you have glancing blows, are adjusted based on the level the creature is above you in level. For instance for each level that the mob is above you, it reduces your crit Chance by 1%; up to 3. If I recall correctly. The rate at which you deal glancing blows is a nonlinear progression based on the targets level. A target that is lower than you in level should never be dealt a glancing blow.
---
Sounds like the groups you are in tbh, but I'll proceed with some tipes anyway.  
---
The biggest thing is that you are the leader. You're in charge, and people will follow you. Know the dungeon, watch a playthrough online if it's your first time.  
---
The difference is all in the exceptions. You've got your rules, now you have to figure out the best ways to break them.  
---
What is your group like? Look at their classes as you head over and discern what they'll be doing. A melee heavy group will need you to do small pulls of one or two mobs, but keep them going rapid fire until your healer needs mana. The healer can keep up, nothing gets overwhelming, and you will plow through.  
---
A magic heavy group will want you to get bigger pulls, with breaks in between. They might not tell you they need a mana break, but they do, so just "mana" in the chat and stop in your tracks when you see them running low. Especially the healer!  
---
Yes, you should be taking all the damage, but sometimes when everything's too much, let another player or their pet take take threat to ease off on the healer temporarily. In a situation like this, you want to be as still as possible, because a clusterfuck of you running around taking threat is making lives hard. (A hunters pet becomes your brother when you tank). You need to be able to spot when this needs to happen, and that takes experience.  
---
Tag enemies when you pull. Hit them each with at least one attack  The healer deals threat when they heal (they will pull off you) so if you have a baseline of 1 sunder in each mob, it'll be much easier to gain control over the pack again.  
---
The most important thing is making sure your dps aren't acting a fool. They must focus on one enemy at a time, so make sure they're aware of what your tags mean. Don't let the mage force aoe on the group, don't let the warrior use sunder etc. Also they are not allowed to pull unless you say so!  
---
Tanking is easy to mess up, and takes a lot of awareness. It feels like you're on stage, with your every move scrutinised by your party, and can be pretty brutal. You will be a good tank, because like it or not, dungeons are the only way we can level with decent efficiency 😂😂  
---
I hope you can find something useful out of this, and good luck on your journey 👏👏
---
Every birthday until 19 was fantastic. 19 and 20 were meh... excuse to party I guess? 21 was fantastic again (in the US), after that? Who cares. I don't think I've had a birthday party since my 22nd and I'm 36 now.
---
Exactly. If a hunter pulls that crap so will I.
---
I was under the impression that Quest Experience doesn't change regardless of what color difficulty it is for you, unless it's grey.
---
Mob Experience on the other hand scales with level discrepancy.
---
Sometimes works while moving. Not reliably.
---
Is the OP trolling cos people always misspell Rogue as Rouge. Even posted the definition of rouge. 😂
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
Nice drawing but I'm baffled by the title....
---
I'm not sure what to do now.... Pm_MeYour_WhootyPics on reddit is doubting my ability to comprehend the English language.
---
I'll be honest, my life seems to no longer have meaning.
---
From fishing chests, yeah. Along with cloth and sometimes gems.
---
Its not an achievement or something to boast about spending 70 hours camping for pets its pathetic especially when your being given an option to cut that down massively and have no reasons to complain about it.
---
Your just an elitist moron who thinks that anyone who didnt tame their pet with 1000s of other hunters scowering the area for it didnt truely earn it.
---
get a grip and sort your life out and realize that wow isn't that important and shouldnt require those kind of hours for a virtual pet.
---
Dude i dont even know rhe name of my vanill char... but i respect your way
---
Can you give an example or rewrite it?
---
Pretty sure we had resil, but hey, its been 15 years, so maybe im wrong.
---
People with the same two hobbies as me?
---
Honestly this is the shit I love about rogues.
---
I'm slowly leveling my classic rogue up and I'm 30 at the minute on a PvP server, I act under the impression that anything red is dead, doesn't matter if they're 20 or 40 they get attacked all the same.
---
On the boat from booty Bay to ratchet I engaged a 36 night elf warrior as we landed and kept her distracted long enough for the boat to start moving away again, I vanished and had just enough time to drop combat and sap her before quickly sprinting to the top deck and leaping off, landing just short of the pirate cove to the north , the warrior however slowly became a distant red dot, no idea why she didn't use berserker rage. 
---
Sometimes its not about being the strongest, its about being the smartest.
---
what does BRD 'touch rooms' mean?
---
Let’s hear it for Old Blanchy horde!
---
Id buy it just from the pitch alone, and I'm a mage.
---
Im talking about disputes over things like whether the holy pally can roll on caster gear or the rogue who wants to roll on his BiS bow with a hunter in the group.
---
We had some guy ask in gchat how to get to one place near loch modan or something and asked if he had to go through the water and then when no one answered within 15 seconds he just gquit. Hahahah
---
Yeah, that makes sense, but if you are constant critting but have low AP, is agi really better? I guess more flurry = more hits = more damage. Why am I even questioning it? Hah, this has been tested over and over again I'm sure.
---
Especially for the alliance
---
Billville, obviously.
---
Warriors: "I pulled a second mob and I died!"
---
Most classes have some kind of CC for a second mob if they accidentally pull, or are strong enough to take out a second, but warriors, not so much.
---
I think only warlock might be able to pull 3 in the early teens and survive with some fear micro, but still it's a corpse run.
---
Lol. Imagine saying you won the argument while: contradicting yourself, not making a single fair point, claiming his arguments are being cherry picked, and even throwing a sneaky straw-man at the end.
---
That is some irony, borderline pathetic.
---
I was simply stating you were (still are, actually) being asinine, excuse me if that’s too much for you to handle.
---
And then on top of that your reply essentially is“you’re mad learn to use asinine I’m clearly not one good day”, not even refuting why you’re not being asinine. Thanks for the laugh though.
---
&gt; It works for them, but lots of crazy shit works when you have all bis main and offset items
---
Asmongold was testing dual-wield tanking in UBRS yesterday, and even though he's pretty heavily geared-up and so are his healers, I'd say it was a good showing for the spec. He fared extremely well in single-target situations rather than packs of mobs, but even there his Cleaves were still pretty slammin'
---
I did this too right before I bought my mount. You’ll be alright bro.
---
It's startling. A fully kitted 19 twink can have several times the hp of a regular level 19, like 1.5k compared to 600. Not to mention the insane weaponry and armor and stat values, enchants... It's a whole different game. I personally prefer the 39 and 49 brackets, because the classes are a little more fleshed out, the specs are deeper, you have access to AB, and it's less steamroll-y. And at 49 you have access to your 30 point talent.
---
Tfw classic wow turns you into a hardcore business man
---
Ha, same! I thought I was just nuts or failed to loot properly.
---
What’s your server
---
Even the mages have to drink sometimes, I have heard of a technique where you can spam drinks while walking and regen your mana.
---
It's kind of a double edge sword. You get people like you who find it interesting, but then you also get people who use it to crap on the developers. The type of people who reply with stuff like "lol how did you guys not notice that. lazy devs."
---
Thank you for your reply.    
---
&gt; you have to be willing to wait slightly longer than mages have to.
---
How long roughly should that be? I'm currently waiting 10-15 seconds already, using just throwing up curse of weakness in the mean time, even after doing no damage for 10+ seconds, I instantly overaggro.   
---
I had not been using VW so I will certainly do that.
---
Id say you can do it at 46, most the trash doesnt exceed 47. You'll just have a tougher time on the bosses at are 50+
---
Unfortunately the Hand of Justice is pretty much BiS for all physical dps just because of the +20 AP.  Unless the hunter is running with only Mages/Locks, they would never get it if they passed for melee.
---
For an mmo thats fine, me myself is at around 30. Some friends have around 20 and some around 100. And none of us has any issues. If you were playing an fps game i would aim below 30, but it doesnt matter all that much in an mmo.
---
level 32 with exactly 33 gold.  I know i probably have lost some in postage, but i made a bank char and at the end of every session when I got to AH to list my leather, I send them all my gold with the exception of some spare change to buy arrows, pet food, and a flight path back to quests.  This stops me from spending it on frivolous things that I know would spend it on.  Like others here, I'm sitting on some class spells (though most are junky or not practical) and I'm taking advantage of all the free stuff I can get (like loading up on harvest festival food for pet or asking mages from dungeon runs to top me off when the run is over).  I doubt I'll be able to buy exactly at 40 , but i'm trying damnit.
---
I didn’t want to waste time killing him, so as long as he didn’t attack me I left him alone. That’s an agreement. Then he broke the agreement. 
---
It seems like a few people are getting real upset at my pvp anecdote and the literal definition of what an “agreement” actually is.
---
says bottom dps player who makes the argument “Who cares about dps just do the dungeon! Also, get off my lawn!”
---
Can confirm. I was using it about 2 months before the Skarm videos on it. It went viral in the classic upper raiding scene really fast. Took about 5 months for it to go from meme to meta. Skarm just capitolized on it and made a video on it during the big craze.
---
Lots of paladins will take whatever role they can to get into a dungeon but we all know we pretty much have to heal at the end. Our BIS gear pre raid and in some cases DURING raids are almost never plate.
---
I'm not aware of any like that. Usually procs take up a lot of ilvl points.
---
I use this macro for SS:
---
 \#showtooltip Sinister Strike  
---
/startattack  
---
/cast Sinister Strike 
---
I never checked if it resets auto attack timer when switching targets but I don't think it does? Will check later.
---
To my understanding, if you're not sword spec (as in you have the talent to proc extra hits on sword hits) it doesn't matter to SS after your MH swing. With sword spec you wanna wait for your MH swing because SS can proc the sword extra hit which would reset your hit timer. If you don't have that talent, SS won't mess with your swing timer.
---
Yea this isn’t 2006 and you’re not getting hand of rag. Have fun though (:
---
Yeah that's the thing, many times people will always post after the fact about an experience they had even if the experience is completely resolved because they have lingering frustration that they were not able to fully get out by laying into whoever annoyed them in the game.
---
I mean probably brings down their entire gaming experience to hold onto frustration like that but hey it's their time
---
Yeah I feel like one of the biggest drivers of a healthy server economy is raiding. It's a huge money and consumables sink, plus a lot of raiders are leveling twinked-to-hell alts that need low-level gear and trade materials.
---
Without that it's just a bunch of people leveling their mains and trying to buy mounts.
---
im lvl 10 and lost all y silver :(
---
I have two accounts for this very reason! Not for trashtalk mind you, more or less to talk to people who act friendly in open world to thank them, and coordinate what quests they might need help with, and what quests I might need help with as well.
---
Special characters are cringe inducing
---
Healers love to collect tanks. Its a sad day when they reroll dps tho.
---
It's literally not a bug. They designed it poorly. The programming followed the design. It was a design choice that they did not think through, and was thus capable of being exploited. The code was correct, but the thought process that demanded it was incomplete.
---
This shield thing? A bug, because obviously they wanted critical strikes to still work against shields. Falling through the floor of a level and using that to reach a boss without fighting trash? That's both an exploit *and* a bug. Switching parties to reset bosses? An exploit, because the code was coherent and doing exactly what it was supposed to do.
---
What about the same comments on every getter and setter?
---
And bolts of cloth, from trunks that can be fished up from pools. I got enough last night to have a tailor make 4 runecloth bags for me
---
Profession recommendations?
---
Good to know, thanks for your input!
---
This is why our guild is running three "main" tanks. None of them get to be the special snowflake loot whore. We want our tanks to be interchangeable parts so that the raid machine can still run if one fails for whatever reason.
---
Put it in your bank, you’ll need it at some point
---
You dont need to add the word “innocent” to your sentence. It is redundant and makes it sound as if you are a news outlet wanting to clickbait or draw attention.
---
And if you *are* the tank, Stoneskin is key vs. 3+ targets, not to mention that bonus str for party members makes them generate more threat.  More power to shaman #2 for placing it though as it buffs you as well.
---
I say something back when someone "grats"s me on a trivial achievement. Oh neat, I spent 5k on flying, go me? I had 30k gold. Might as well get that last tier. Who fucking cares.
---
30. Get that Row 5 Talent.
---
Perhaps it was a PvP specific thing then? I doubt they'd change FD like that in TBC. PvP combat and PvE combat work in different ways.
---
??
---
You lost 18s 75c .... I think you'll survive
---
You gain A and W but lose E and F but that's not the point of it. You gain more key binds because you can now also reach one more over so using 6 T Y G H V and B are much easier than if you stick with wasd movements
---
My bad, I assumed all melee had a ranged pull.
---
Still need the MCP to really shine as bear. That threat generation is insane.
---
Or just run to another graveyard...
---
You can use both in WoW :)
---
FD can not be resisted by players though so there's no chance for it to fail there, yet there's still a big delay in dropping combat in pvp.
---
Probably should have said that you just dung.
---
Ah fell
---
No, instead they want to hear grind something else like it makes a difference.  And everyone wants the best spot, but as soon as you tell anyone, it’s not the best spot anymore, it’s a clusterfuck of 20 people grinding in the same spot.
---
Ha! That's always a bummer!  I accidentally used the last of my gold after my mount to buy coal so I couldn't even take the flight path.  Had a good laugh at myself from that one!
---
No, the comment I was replying to was talking about pve. You are apparently clueless. Rogues would take those weapons and go hemo for nax raids. Hemo is still viable in pvp even with out those weapons was my point.
---
Might is a ret/enh or PvP weapon. Salad Bakers doesnt run a ret. Nobody has PvE priority on 2h weapons in meta comps like they ran. Not really that crazy for the MT to have a Might.
---
It's an absolute classic.
---
Larry David is genius
---
Seem like you're save. Judging by the scenery in the background you're seconds away from arriving in booty bay and the guards will obliterate anyone who attacks you at that point. As well you can just jump into the water and same thing is going to happen.
---
If you were further out.... not so much.
---
I really hope people keep playing. I just started and my troll priest is only level 13 :(
---
What are FR?
---
You can dot up the targets while you wait as well. The damage Curse of Agony does is backloaded, so tanks have no issues holding aggro over it at the start of fights. Whether that is worth it obviously depends on how long it takes for the pack to die, but Hellfire is never an exact science, and it's kind of designed that way on purpose. It's high risk, high reward.
---
Basically, if you aren't familiar with the tank, it might just be a lot easier to use dots + Rain of Fire.
---
It is also /tell in WoW. Numerous MMOs have used it and still do, actually.
---
Google shadow panther leveling tips. Or see Rogue Classic discord.
---
Fair for that reason, unfair to ask people to give up their spot to you.
---
Wow, i do the same keybind for my interrupt abilities. Mb5 is pvp trinket
---
They’re not just your cloth drops.
---
you didn't mention what server you were on - unless i missed it. i am a pretty social person myself and add people to my friends list readily if i enjoyed questing with them etc. anyone that has played retail has shifted to the less social behavior IMO just because of lfg/random dungeon queues etc, so classic is a bit of a step back for them. you might have to push the issue a little. not like...being pushy, but you know - asking people if you can add them to friends lists etc. definitely try to join a guild - even huge ones will have a group of people that are rather social.
---
You're a psychopath.
---
Private servers have better class mechanics currently because they run off the 1.12 client not zombie-legion client.
---
However, Classic has the correct drop chances, proc chanes, armor values, and resistance values.
---
I had a guildy get asked for their last 5 man DPS meters to be whispered to someone that was forming a group before they would take them.  They were doing Scarlet Monastery.  
---
People are fucking nuts.
---
Can you send a permanent discord link for druid things
---
Probably because people are generally very stupid.
---
If I'm sharing the same quest mobs as members of the other faction, I'll keep to my side and they keep to theirs. The implication is obvious enough that even a toddler would understand. If I end up in range of their mob while they're attacking it, I'll throw a DoT on it. If I see one running towards more mobs, I'll usually try to help them kill it before they pull five more accidentally. They typically return the favor.
---
And that's the unspoken (literally, because it's impossible cross-faction) agreement. How people are too dense to understand this is beyond me.
---
That does not apply on all cases since I'm sure mobs are doing critical damage on my shield, even saw an elite destroying my shield with a single crit
---
So is "I killed c'thun on a private server" the new WoW Classic Fuckboi defense? 
---
Cuz I can't wait to whip out my collectors edition panda cub and silence these vanilla wow elite fetuses.
---

---
Should've I was kinda shocked tbh
---
Do you have a recommendation for a better place? Going to finish my fishing skill this weekend, would love to know.
---
Same happened to me in Booty Bay with stoneskin.
---
Death to the Scourge. And Death to your GPU!
---
Update the title to be: "Tailoring guide done by icy-veins"
---
can u lockpick UBRS?
---
what can u not LP?
---
can u solo Princess reliably without raid gear? got a video?
---
are BRD/RFD pp runs really worth it now?
---
I've always been a healer. I played cata release (but not much after that), but, yeah healing was so freaking easy in WOTLK it was stupid not to faceroll everything nonstop. And then cata made healing actually challenging and I don't think the tanks realised it. They just kept trying to faceroll everything not worrying about a damn thing and it was a struggle to keep up.
---
You honestly need to either move on our grind out 2 to 3 levels. Trust me when I say that during your time leveling....You. Are. Going. To. Have. To. Grind.
---
I've personally grinded out 23 to 25 to make Duskwood a bit easier, 40 to 42 in prep for for massive Cath runs then moving to Ulda then ZF grind runs.
---
The grind becomes apart of you. Let it mold you, build you, harden you against being bored at all times w/no quests to carry you through.
---
? Random idiot shaming the correct way to play and I called him out on it for the benefit of people who don’t know better. I’m perfectly calm right now sir.
---
Well it happened. Troll rogue of course
---
Straight truth. Hilarious blizzard called those transfers ‘free’ like they had value. more like “just leave to a dead server so the less gullible others can play”.
---
Succubus for 1vX but 1v1 a shaman do you think felhunter would be better?
---
If he has decent luck. I ran uldaman and mara like 5 times each - not one hunter piece dropped for me from either instance. Just wasn't in the cards. I am a one n done until 60 just for quest completion and that's it. It's a tough life being a hunter hahaha
---
Idk just my opinion. I never look at flairs to tell me what a post is.
---
The timestamps make it all that much better
---
&gt;Purge every 15 seconds so you don't go OOM
---
There is a quest in Darkshore that sends you to Menethil Harbor.
---
From there, it's a matter of using your brain to figure out "Okay, these quests are getting a little rough, I can either stay here and kill stuff, or I can go to a similar leveled zone in one of the other areas that I should know exist because there are 3 other races in my faction, and they have to level somewhere too right? That quest sent me to a harbor on another continent, and there's a lot of humans/dwarves/gnomes there, that's a good start."
---
Or you could use chat to ask anyone else for direction.
---
I only sometimes said hi and bye when I felt like it and my guild leader quickly told me that it is expected you always say hi and bye when you log on/off. So everyone was forced to say it. It was a "casual guild with no obligations", that's why I originally joined. Took a short break from WoW and quickly got kicked for inactivity after being active in the guild for a few months. It was pointless anyway and just hi, bye, gz spam. So I can relate to that guy, at some point it just gets annoying
---
Edit: That was BFA btw
---
I'm just going to go ahead and say this, if you are a hunter and you roll need on a melee weapon where the *only* upgrade is that it either has a melee on-proc event or has more white damage, you are an asshole
---
/thread
---
As a warrior you should literally carry these with you at all times.
---
Yeah my worst yet I'd say
---
To be honest functions like these often exist because there is a huge number of assumptions and data dependent behavior that would be cumbersome and illogical to split into several functions. Not saying that's necessarily the case here, but there are many legitimate cases where this happens often in lower level libs.
---
Keep that SnD up in PVE and make sure you are hitting two targets so you can show your top DPS. If you pull the second target pop evasion, if the tank doesn’t switch or can’t get it back vanish. That’s how you Rouge!
---
I'm a horde mage and I give everyone int that I think can benefit from it. I'm new to the game, but I do it as I'm travelling to quest areas if I pass any fellow horde members along the way that are questing or look like they're heading out to quest.
---
This was stickied by u/Ex_iledd because we accidentally unstickied it last week and thus Rogues got "skipped" in the rotation. Just wanted people to know why the date is a week old.
---
Ok I'm home.
---
They main tools for my UI are:
---
ClassicCastbars: Adds a good looking castbar on you and enemies.
---
ClassicThreatMeter: Keeps threat count (if others have the addon)
---
Details!: Detailed damage/healing/buff/debuff/uptime/dispell/interupt etc. counting.
---
Dominos: To add/Remove/Configure action bars.
---
LortiUI: Adds the shadowy graphics on bars/unitframes etc.
---
Weakauras2: Buff/Debuff/CD tracker
---
KUINameplates: Nameplates on mobs to check debuff duration, track combo points from one more source, show spellcasts.
---
Mik's Scrolling Combat Text: Pretty much to place my damage done and healing/damage received on a place I want on the screen with a nice font.
---
Sexymap: Makes minimap pretty and hides the 900 minimap buttons you get by having 40 addons.
---
TipTop: Better tooltip so it's not stuck showing on top of your details addon
---
Leatrix Plus: Generic QoL changes among adding "Elite Player frame" and class colour behind the names. Big bonus it auto-dismounts, sells trash, repairs etc.
---
Extra:
---
DBM: Boss mods to keep track of boss CDs
---
DejaClassicStats: A nice way to see your detailed stats.
---
WeaponSwingTimer: To keep track of weapon reset so I can time my abilities.
---
VendorPrice: Says items vendor value.
---
Spy: Shows nearby enemy faction players.
---
RealMobHealth: Keeps data on mobs HP and shows it on their portrait.
---
Prat 3.0: Chat addon, QoL.
---
FasterLooting: Does what it says.
---
Coordinates: Cause you never know when you might need them.
---
Aux: Pretty auction house that keeps item prices etc.
---
AdiBags: Makes your bag one box so you don't have to OCD on keeping your bags tidy. (Got it after the video)
---
Atlas Loot Classic: Shows boss drops.
---
Pretty much that's it. If you like it I can make an addon folder to share with saved variables, even tho I suggest taking them one by one and configuring them on your own to see what you like.
---
Enjoy that while it lasts
---
on retail it would actually be faster
---
I don’t think there’s more than 2 maybe 3 layers on most servers except the big two now anyway.
---
I'll tell you one thing. Running SM as a warrior. Being like 38 and still don't have some of the best mail gear that drops and won't be replaced by plate till mid to upper forties. Nothing grinds my gears more then a shaman rolling on mail they can't even use for 2 to 5 levels when warriors clearly can use it already.
---
i remember seeing up to 9 multiboxes.
---
This is a problem with real life partnership and group work as well. And businesses. What is expected, should always discussed beforehand.
---
It's not really a choice for me(well, OK it is). As a druid I can be either a tank or healer, as I maintain two gear sets.
---
But most relevantly, if I tank, then I set the pace of the dungeon. My style is slower, steadily, and no deaths. It will not be a fast go go go run, but we *will* get it done. If it is possible to LOS the pull, then it shall happen. If it is possible to keep everyone safe, then it will be.
---
Might be boring, might be "not exciting enough" but if you group with me as the tank, then this is what you get. I'm sick of healing warriors "tanks" with the 2H weapon who think they are the melee cleave gods when the group composition isn't even setup for one.
---
The big one for me is portal hubs. I can get to anywhere I want in like 5 minutes on retail. Dal hearthstone and port off to wherever the fuck. Which, while convenient, makes it all feel so much more trivial.
---
The interface is clear...  If you need it press need.  I don't like those who exclude all from a team that could need stuff they want.  That should be a reason for verbal abuse. You did right here.
---
We wiped yesterday because the tank left a mob on me (priest healer), and then pulled another trash pack while my mana was at 5%.
---
Some tanks are just bad.  =/
---
Not pictured: the naga bodies surrounding the op, and the ocean of blood that is coming out of them.
---
Yeah off nefarian and the Cape of frozen wrath is a 1% drop, that shaman deserves blacklisting
---
I think mages can do whatever they want because they have 2x iceblocks.  I wouldn't get in a dick measuring contest with them.
---
tfw when they let an orc into Moonglade
---
Oh ok will do, thanks for that!
---
They've got to feed their pets to keep them happy.  Dying pisses them off. So they have to feed them more. Something like that.  Some guildmate was complaining about it and I was like really?  I mean I'm a rogue what'd you think I'd do with that info?
---
Gotcha, well the plus side is my guildies all have good enchants for our level.
---
Longer hearthstone cd, less flight paths, no flying, these all count. 
---
Biggest thing though in my opinion is that there are no city portals - you actually have to travel. Huge deal for me personally, enormous fan.
---
it would mean less karmas tho
---
Also he's a cool looking lion instead of a scruffy assed hill cat.
---
This. I am the veteran friend in this situation and I feel like some kind of Dungeon Master - to keep it interesting instead of saying to my friends “lvl here” or “get this quest” I make it a little more RP..
---
“Legend tells that a sword of great power will be acquired by those willing to venture into the depths of Blackfathom” 
---
Also been running them through to Flight Masters in every potential quest hub for them so they don’t run out / get stuck. 
---
It really brings the Multiplayer part of MMO out needing to ask questions in my opinion.
---
It's actually impressive how fast he died.
---
This shit has more bugs than original.  Wtf.
---
Idk about Darkshore specifically but the quests are meant to bring you to other zones too, and then you stay in that zone a while (2+ levels) before going back
---
Thats when you write down his name and camp them at 60
---
Back in vanilla the common practice was quest the quests that you can do with your level, and the advice from WoW I believe was grind mobs lol
---
But ya, head to wetlands from auberdine and hit up loch and westfall. Remember if you choose to go to westfall quickest way is to go to ironforge and take the tram from tinker town district to stormwind. Remember to collect the flight points
---
Sorry but, what's the bug here? Shouldnt the crits be absorbed until enough damage is done to bust it?
---
Pls no more Whitekanye. Everyone in my MC raid had to put him on ignore last night
---
The group of friends I play with are Tank, Healer, and 1 DPS so we have to pull in 2 DPS for all dungeon runs. We've basically stopped grabbing Shamans (healer is Sham, so we still get that sweet sweet Windfury) for this same exact reason. We've done probably 40+ dungeon runs at this point and have never had a single issue with Hunters, only Shamans. Like an oddly high number of Shamans have ninja'd shit they don't need. It's easier to just not invite them at all.
---
I had a simimlar experience yesterday traveling to Loch Modan to get a heart. 
---
I'm passing through Arathi (Level 27) when I see a Night Elf Druid (36) enter Cat Form and start to follow me. I was suspicious. He gets closer and I immediately DoT him up with Corruption and Agony so he can't Prowl; my little Imp starts to join in. The fight begins.
---
He starts to paw at me with great ferocity. As usual for a Warlock: Fear is my best friend. I've been lucky enough so far to have all of my spells connect. The Fear lands! I reapply my DoTs and whip out my mighty wand to whittle some of his health down. Fear falls off and manages to get off a heal. Damn. Queue the infamous Druid move: the Moonfire Panic Spam. He depleted his mana so fast he couldn't shift back into Cat Form. I fire off another Fear, and he runs right into a raptor that starts to help me kill him. The battle is *so* close! I have 11hp left, but I land the killing blow. The Druid with 9 levels on me lays on the ground defeated--shocked that he lost to a level 27 Warlock.
---
I /lol at him. I am victorious! "Ehehehehe--BLEH" My female undead cackle is rudely cut off by a raptor who snuck up on me while I was savoring my moment. I run back to my corpse to find that he still has not released his spirit. I continue on my journey to collect the heart for my Succy (named Cattwena).
---
I'm about to /gquit. Some people have no culture in their lives. Cool, I get it. It's just really obvious when all you spew are internet memes and trendy phrases.
---
Oof. Pog. MOOD. Big gratz. Ugh...I joined because I had a good experience with a member, but if I'd know the rest of the guild was like this, I wouldn't have.
---
Get the felhunter out
---
Because the pun
---
I think what you are describing what happens if you cast aimed shot too early and interrupt the previous auto.  When the aimed shot goes off the auto fires instantly instead of after .5 secs.  It's a dps loss but the burst can be great for pvp since they both come out at the same time.
---
Taking fun pvp arena out??
---
ahhh it was like i was there! def worth
---
There are more quest zones for your level 
---
You will constantly change level zones and come back to them
---
Yep even the high pop servers it’s hard to find groups right now. We know what the vanilla like populations were. problem is high pop is actually ideal size. yes farming is harder and leveling is slower but group finding is way better and there is more world pvp. higher pop is always better. up to the point of layering and queues. the transfer to servers are just too low. they should consider merging them.
---
Some people do enjoy speed clearing tho. I know I do.
---
You gonna inv elemental shaman for wf totem? That's the dumbest thing I have head lately.
---
Yes. It's nice to be able to do quests as alliance now!
---
I am saying 99% of the time when Chris Metzen makes a statement like that he is correct. In this one narrow context though he was beyond wrong. He was crazily out of touch. That being said everyone is going to be out of touch about something at some point.
---
&gt;  For the sword!!!
---
That's a funny way to say 'axe'.
---
Massive RNG based, more reliable is going ele and 1-shotting people with chain lightning. Much more reliable burst.
---
Ooooorrrrrr they have temporarily ported you over to hardware in the US while they finish securing bandwith and resources in SA that meet their standard. At which point they roll a restart and bob's your uncle. odds are 50/50 bro
---
Yarp long as a person is actually at their keyboard multi-boxing is allowed. And trust me u/Irelia_FTW I've seen someone who could multi-box 5 shammies back in BC. I even think there was a guy at one time who had a full raid multibox in BC, possibly WotLK. Don't remember.
---
This happens with classic.  Get on a boat and visit the other continent.  The world is big you are supposed to see it more instead of grinding one zone at a time until completion.
---
Why on azeroth should a paladin tank with a 2hand in Uldaman? Thats beyond stupid.
---
When that 15 year old nerd grew up to be a marketing consultant.
---
Or a general understanding of the FP network
---
How about taking a super low level priest that just learned pws. That will rule out talents.
---
Could use as well
---
* Grind mobs at or slightly below your level
---
* Go to either Loch Modan or Westfall
---
* You could *attempt* DM, but 15 is going to be a bit low
---
That’s it Paul, I’ve had it with your disobedience. You’re fired!
---
Do you hear this man, oh ye big tough warriors, yes you with the quest 2H axe? Yes, yes it's totally OK to tank with 1h+shield!
---
Yes, that's what you should be doing, please. Until you outgear/outlevel the dungeon, we healers would appreciate that you didn't try to "tank" with the Whirlwind Axe.
---
Only topped by comments that are like “running this loop twice because it doesn’t seem to work properly the first time — **DO NOT REMOVE”**.
---
Eh, to a point. I've been a software engineer for over a decade and I very rarely find a problem that can't be abstracted to higher level concepts that are easier to code for. But you're right in that there is such a thing as over-abstraction, and sometimes just piling on the code into a function is the right tradeoff.
---
Something you replace in your 40s us shaman use that mail set up until 60 so you can deal with your grinded gears plate wearer
---
He asked a legitimate question and you shit on him.
---
Yeah it was! Also I miss EQ. WoW Classic is fun, but so far nothing has matched my experiences in EQ:-(. Played from 1999 to 2009 and then life got too busy to play.
---
The group of stealthed rogues below deck: "Hehe. I'm the danger!"
---
I had it happen by applying sharpening stone to my axe in SM GY. Standing at the door, everyone is sat food buffing, I applied the stone, and the first mob started running at me.
---
Scared to death scared to look IN HIS FUCKIN YEAR BOOK!
---
Good thing you had the steam running. I had a similar experience with the GM of the biggest guild on my server. He AFK’d the entirety of Uldaman and when we asked him to please DPS final boss so we could clear it, he pulled a patrol, made us wipe, then left the group.
---
I just so happened to be streaming as a stress test for my new PC, and I never ever stream. Uploaded it to YouTube, and I’m still seeing people make jokes about him and that guild in global channels two weeks later.
---
Reputation actually means a lot.
---
I generally use bite while questing out in the world, as it will never bottom out your focus and you'll always be able to taunt as needed.
---
With claw, sometimes you'll have 0 focus when you need to taunt. It's only a second difference, but when it does matter, it really matters.
---
In dungeons, as you generally don't need to taunt, claw is better, as it does more total damage.
---
Oh, he upgraded his hat since last time I saw him. Probably some epic drop.
---
I commute the same time as him. He’s very... noticeable.
---
Investment is the same he leveled them together and only has to cover the 5 subscriptions. Honestly though with as much gold as peeps have on retail they could easily fund 5 accounts for several months.
---
People have problems. If they want to let people know they just leveled up, that's fine. If people don't want to say grats, that's also fine. 
---
But if either person gets upset because they either didn't get a response or feel the need to respond against their will, they just need to calm down. It's really nothing to get upset about.
---
Lol grow up your not 10 if being called a moron or stupid offends you then you shouldnt go to any online forum
---
If yoy decide to reroll on Netherwind (horde) send me mail on my main Nutkiss and I'll run you through some dungeons - I'm grinding my mount gold
---
You spoke my thoughts and that's exactly how I felt the other night in Uldaman. Typical dps "tank" with the Ravager axe who not only rushed through pulls, but wiped us repeatedly because he was playing a game of "don't let the healer drink".
---
More than once, he was surrounded by scorpions and no amount of healing was going to save him. Like where is this kind of playstyle/attitude coming from? Retail or something?
---
more like Ragefire Jizzum, awesome drawing!
---
"Want to know how I got these scars..."
---
Not everyone lives on the subreddit
---
Dinging level 15 saved your ass LOL
---
But that wouldn't matter for pvp
---
You can see my Skelton on the stairs in BB from when one of your pally’s was repeatedly killing me and then bubbling to the water. 
---
Finally was able to slow him down before dying so the guards could kill him after 3-4 tries lol.
---
I’ll be back for vengeance when I’m 60. 
---
I’m not sure if it’s a bug or it was this way in classic, but apparently if a Pally uses Hammer of Justice in BB, the guards will actually kill the pally’s target first, despite the target never engaging. 
---
Very lame if it’s a bug and your pally is exploiting it.
---
Aren't there mods that do it automatically
---
These sound like guilds who zerg invited, so they're probably still slow clearing MC
---
Welcome to the magic of World PvP.
---
Seems like you don’t know what an agreement is, to be honest. 
---
Instead of wasting my time giving you the literal definition of an agreement and defending why my pvp story from 3 weeks ago is one, I’m just going to go on with my day.
---
that's correct... you are not a tech expert, and you are completely wrong.
---
BiS lists are for the braindead. Know your class and know your stat priorities. Collect pieces as you need them focusing on stats which will most improve your gameplay.
---
A hunter needs a slow weapon for autoshot / aimshot weaving.  The 3.2 second speed on blackcrow meets that need and it also contributes to reaching the 9% hit cap. 
---
Chances are the hunter is having trouble getting the 2% hit shoulders in UBRS considering the shoulders’ are needed by all non-caster dps. As a result, they’re likely under cap.
---
A bow is their primary weapon and if it’s an improvement for them and they haven’t reached hit cap yet, then they should roll need.
---
I would warn them beforehand that I’d like to roll as it’s my BiS, but I’m not going to tell them they can’t roll on it.
---
Hemo isn't bad, but its a bit gear dependent.  I went as subtlety up to Preparation then started in Assassination with Malice (+crit chance) but combat works too.
---
If you’re stuck just grind man... find easy mobs you can down easy and keep going.
---
Do not forget the social part.
---
Look for ppl in game. 
---
Ask advices.
---
Follow other players in places you don’t know.
---
Eventually move to westfall.
---
I’m jealous because I know I will never experience again those feelings. Enjoy your leveling, explore and meet ppl. This game is unique and now you have the fortune of being a new player living a wonderful journey!
---
!!
---
Unless they have changed their tos you are only allowed to share your account with a single minor child that you are the guardian of.
---
What about DS/Ruin?
---
Had a hunter ask the group politely if he could roll on Hypnotic Blade, because the spell damage would boost his Arcane Shots.
---
We just said "no" collectively and he passed on it.
---
We didnt even need to explain why it should go to the priest, so maybe he was joking.
---
Lul Jesus fuck
---
7:3 is only 60:40.     
---
Arugal Oceanic is something crazy like 65:35 in the hordes favour.
---
This is how I have my macro setup and it does work, but not perfectly. If you dont stand still for the loot window you will have to loot the mob again after it dies. 
---
In a group I do find the mob needs to be looted regularly by party members before I can pick up the pick pocket loot. Other times my char will bend down to pick up pick pocket loot and it will just be an empty window.
---
You just rebind forward key on other accounts to /follow so when you walk forward the first guy runs and others follow it.
---
Had someone right click on on my name -&gt; add to b.net from the opposite faction.
---
Cross faction collusion is usually to do with world bosses, and doing something like the devilsaur mafia. Not just "hey can you help me kill X elite since it's like 6am on a Tuesday and there's 3 people in the zone."
---
lmao this is what blizzard shills literally believe, how are there so many of you?
---
15 is a good time to go to westfall and start the people's militia and defias brotherhood quest chains, which you'll finish by killing the deadmines boss. Questing around there should get you up to 17-18 easily enough then you can start running deadmines.
---
critical hits do nothing to the shield, instead of absorbing its set amount until it fades.  so to answer your second question, yes it should but it is not.  hes just hitting away at the priests shield with recklessness to only hit with critical hits and its doing nothing heh.
---
Everyone going into this game thinking they're going to be hardcore top 1% Classic raiders.
---
Lmao. Valid reason
---
What exactly should I be doing during dungeons if I join as dps?  I'm 49 right now and have run ZF a few times, but am yet to do Mara or ST.  I'm just unsure if I should be sitting back and spamming spells (and drinking) constantly or if I should be jumping into melee with a 2hder or is it a bit of both to help regen mana or what.
---
Mount up in shadow priest form, all mounts go shadow mode too
---
What? I played from beta vanilla through to WotLK and could FD+trap while running. This was never a problem back then.
---
Thanks! Crap spawn rate isn't it? Only 35 here so will be a while yet!
---
I saw this while opening the chest for the Grimtotem Spying quest in Thousand Needles. WTF?
---
This is my issue. It's always the core group of any guild that becomes this way. If you're someone that hits 60 much later than others, good luck getting into any group running stuff. It's one of my reasons why I hate having to join a guild because I'm a slow player and also have lots of life to deal with so hitting 60 won't even happen in the first 2-3 months. Feels like I'm just screwed and no one will want to take me to raid because I'm not geared, etc. It's the same feeling I got when first trying to earn credit for credit cards. Lol.
---
Back in Vanilla I loved to sap Horde as they were getting on the elevator's in UD. Sometimes if I timed it just right they would die to the UD elevator boss.
---
I mean, be wrong if you want.
---
Agreements require more than just an emote and your imagination.
---
That’s why I just went ahead and tamed Humar. Only Black male lion in the game.
---
Oh shit, is this me?
---
what spell is that?! LOL!
---
Thunderfury does. That's why it's such a coveted item (orange text helps, but is secondary). Thunderfury produces a stupid amount of threat. So stupid it was used even in TBC and had to be nerfed. And since tanks are a bottleneck of the raid, any tank who can produce this much threat automatically becomes main tank. It makes everyone's life much easier, especially for DPS.
---
Of course, this only matters when the other binding drops (although better to never not expect drama when it comes to legendaries). And yes, gearing your other tanks is still very important for split runs.
---
Is there a good spec for resto/ele ? getting close to the 50s and want a better spec for healing but still want to do some prequests and stuff before the dungeons and farming BiS. Really want NS for heals but still being able to solo without using 2mins per mob. Not having to swap gear is also a good thing, when all the enh. gear takes up an entire bag on its own.
---
Delete this
---
You never played vanilla.
---
Doubt it, I think you need a group for it. Even really well geared she would be tough.
---
The furry would think a goat is sexy.
---
How about *forephallic*?
---
Never use castsequence, it can mess up way too easily.
---
Literally never take an enhancement Shaman to an end game dungeon. 
---
These plebs spent weeks levelling a spec they knew was worthless and they’re now so filled with spite they’ll pull that shit. 
---
Shamongs are the new Huntards, change my mind
---
thats me....leveling up i've had shadow wrath head/back/bracers/gloves(before dreamweave)
---
at least the shadow wrath head i have now is a purple pointy witch hat
---
Or maybe think twice before using bad manners.
---
Makes a beautiful background on my phone. Thanks!
---
It works and this was before it shared diminishing returns with your other stuns.  Unless they changed something from the original.  Problem is you won't see great maces until AQ opens.
---
It's classic... Don't expect to have your hands held.
---
This isn't possible in phase 1, wtf are you on about.
---
You realize the warrior needs a 2h to maintain threat and set a strong pace for the dungeon. Shields aren’t necessary, and just slow down everyone. A good warrior will have a shield keybound to use when necessary. Just reading your “slow and steady post” shows me you’re a bad tank. Don’t try to push your incorrect philosophy on others.
---
People's lives have been ruined for something as harmless as marijuana possession. I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
There were always blindspots in booty bay and gadgetzan. As a warlock during Vanilla, I absolutely started shit from dark corners. I don't know this video is one, but the image posted from another user  [https://i.imgur.com/lgriCbW.png](https://i.imgur.com/lgriCbW.png)  was one of the easiest to spot. It's about attacking outside of guard range. This isn't Dalaran where you can't attack people. These are contested areas, with guards, some of whom roam. Pick your openings carefully.
---
How did you grind the rep?
---
🤣
---
Mr. X
---
Commit murder to get a sweet hat? Tough choice...
---
Show me the strawman!
---
I'm a priest so it's working as intended for me 😀
---
Holy shit that is brutal. I’ve been chain-polymorphed by a mage but when that happens I just leave my computer for a few minutes.
---
Try the "fasterlooting" addon, a lot of times the pick pocket does go off but you're just not looting fast enough to get the items.
---
Ah good ol Sam
---
Zygor is pretty nice, didnt experienced any bug
---
I’m happy to see more alliance camping posts. Warms my cold heart 😊
---
Warriors are OP wrecking balls with a pocket healer but you get shut down easily without one. So invest in finding a butt buddy to heal you while you go ham
---
Tbh I just farmed dungeons in the 50s. I'm surprised it's so difficult for you to find BRD groups. Feels like half my server is spamming it.
---
Yeh well the problem at the moment is that 90% of the people that are 60 are try hards, the casuals are still level 30 trying to do gnomeragon. Gonna take a while for them to catch up.
---
Happens to me all the time and I’m a Hunter. I think people do it to spook the other person because usually when I get Hunter’s Marked nothing happens. It definitely helps that there doesn’t seem to be a range on it so you can mark someone from very far away. I only use it when I’m planning on attacking so it was weird to me.
---
just lazy DPS is easy .
---
heh, I wouldn't even humor the guy
---
No you dont
---
No one mentioned PVE in this thread, sir
---
Nope, you're wrong. I just googled "vanilla pvp hunter video" and: https://youtu.be/36EnwyDJ004?t=222
---
He never left combat.
---
If you are happy to pay a month sub and are very lazy, I’ve heard good things about Zygor guides
---
Isn't that something added for argent dawn rep for naxx?
---
I maintain that a new, slightly modernized MUD could still be fairly popular if it were developed today.
---
Forgot the /s tag I’m all for transmog. That’s the stupid argument everyone spouts for why it’s bad and and how they loved sitting in cities when that were a kid inspecting everyone and looking at their tier.
---
They aren't. They hide in a basement of a tavern. We're all Mages, officially...
---
Castsequence macros are usually a no no, they are extremely unreliable because they can't be cancelled, and they won't check if something actually went off or not.

Hey /u/Wrathcharger, I made [this image](https://i.imgur.com/6N9glD5.png) for my own use at the start of Classic, feel free to use it to inform yourself which FPs you're missing. :)

What about to voidwalker bubble?
---
"That seems like a pretty crappy way" = shaming? I mean, I guess if you're ultra sensitive.
---
If you're concerned about the benefit of the people, why not show how I'm wrong so they can see?

Smear some Aloe Vera on that thing. God knows how long its been baking in the Mulgore sun.

It's Sam "Samwise" Didier, Art Director for Blizz, his face was a common sight to those in Warcraft 3, didnt know the same icon was used in WoW lol

If you can’t hit G easily while using WASD move, you’re a pleb.
---
Why roll on something you can't use yet when someone in your group can already use. It's like being resto and rolling on a 1h axe, getting it and saying "oh I'm respeccing after this run"
---
I think part of what makes videogames cool is that you can do what you wouldn't do irl. Stabbing people, for example. Being an ass to people is one of those things and I respect it if that's how you have fun. I just don't like when people say stuff like "corpse camping grey level players is the essence of the game". It's not. It's a dick move. Nothing's preventing you from doing it. But that doesn't mean it's nice
---
Generally I will apply Corruption to all targets, then sac my Voidwalker and Hellfire + Healthstone.
---
Looking like wizard 101
---
&gt; You don't need to drop all your totems. They are heavy mana wasters when you drop for every fight.
---
I can't preach this hard enough. 
---
"Why are you as enhancement dropping mana spring to kill a single target EVERY TIME?!" Oh god its infuriating to watch.  Unless you sit there for 1m30s you don't even recoup the mana cost of the totem itself, nevermind the wasted mana/5 rule time by casting it in the first place.
---
I know for raiding you dont really use the early tiers but would using T1/2 just for open world gathering and grinding be better than raw SP because of all the stam?
---
My grind is the queue. Only reason I don't play more is because I don't want to bother with logging in and seeing a 5 hour wait. I'll just go do something else.
---
So much misinformation in this thread. Low level dungeons do not require a sword and shield, in fact it’s worse. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Could be indeed, but my quest addon guide told me to farm them and then I rememberd not seeing any drop. So that would be the latest phase
---
What bug was I exploiting? Also, I made this to have a discussion. I did message the company, both on twitter and on their customer support site. (BTW, if you can read, it doesn't say I was suspended for a bug or exploit- it says "disruptive gameplay")
---
Nice. Another favorite of mine is the DPS that constantly stands in fire. Then gets mad at you when you stop wasting heals on them and let them die. They never learn...
---
consider downloading a Quest add-on. I use Questie
---
It's a snowball effect, that 20 energy saved lets you do other stuff sooner.  A few seconds can determine who wins in PvP.
---
For the wooshers: its Hotler and Jedue in the rolls and hotler won.. aka not funny
---
ok, i thought i was miss-remembering how it worked...... glad to know im not crazy lol
---
Incendious server?
---
Swinger?
---
i would like to bet that almost no one would put someone on ignore if they saw someone helping an opposing faction
---
Zygor is normally very good, but they screwed up the Classic version by having a terrible leveling plan.  Good news is they listened to the community though and are fixing it.  Zygor really is the best by a mile when it works right.
---
Horde is already fixed and Alliance fix is coming any day now.
---
It’s not free though.  If you want free I’d use Questie.
---
That's one thing that is sadly not going to be as common today. There's still bad players, but people know how to generally build a class even if they've only played in the expacs. Wow was the first MMO for a lot of people, too, so dungeons, raids, PvP, skill bars, were foreign concepts. 
---
Imagine only have played platformers your whole life, then get thrown into HALO. You're gonna be a monkey fucking a football for a long time.
---
Nope. Cannibilize stops immediately with dots.
---
Eating is all you can do.
---
What is a bowmage?
---
Nice! I almost like when groups lose terrible players. The run gets more challenging, yet easier at the same time!
---
Exactly right. I came from WoTLK healing with a Holy Pally, the goal was to just stack int and spam healing as fast as possible.
---
Now I'm playing Priest and mana management is actually important. I've found that waiting until the tank is around 50% or under, then burst healing them up to 100% (without overheals), and waiting for them to get back down to 50% is FAR more efficient than keeping them topped up. I have to drink like half as much.
---
Very relaxing screenshot. Check out r/classicwowscreenshots if you'd like to submit this one or any other epic ones you may have. We have a nice collection going of screenshots like this one.
---

---
&gt; UNLESS layering was never supposed to happen in instances.
---
Isn't it blatantly obvious that it wasn't? What possible reason is there for layering inside an instance to be necessary?
---
Yeah, sounds like you don't like MMOs man.  Bummer.
---
Because if you read the version number they launched wow classic as 1.13 there is no wow classic 1.12
---
As a tip for a warrior, get a crap bow or gun and some basic ammo, use it for when you want to pull that 1 mob that is too close to other mins ti body pull but far enough away that if you shot it, it wouldnt pull others
---
just standing anywhere it feels so much bigger i don't know why. in retail the cities feel tiny but massive in classic
---
Red is dead, i don't discriminate thats why you kill everyone on sight
---
Yeah if I don't need to cast heals and I'm bored I'm just gonna help wand stuff. It doesn't use mana and I'd otherwise just be standing there so whatever.
---
Horde shaman just totally fucked me up.  Camped me for 20 minutes.  Just enough time to write this fanfic!!!
---
LOL
---
We're gatekeeping playing games from people who need an escape now? 
---
Don't do anything except focus on the things that upset you.  Never take time to relax.  Just work on your issues 24/7.
---
By the way, the person who left the guild (if it was an anxiety issue) was doing just that, managing their space and time to give themselves a safe escape and setting themselves up for success so that out IRL they can function.
---
It is absolutely a shaman / ret paladin weapon. Just not that guy in particular
---
I was milling around in Refuge Point the other day and noticed a warrior still wearing the red shirt reward from Eastvale logging camp. I asked them if they would like a nicer shirt than the one they had on. They responded they hadn't give it much thought. I whipped up a dark silk shirt for them and traded to them free of charge. They equipped it and were ecstatic. It's the little things. Chances are on retail the person in question wouldn't be on the same server and the whole interaction couldn't have happened.
---
Nah I'm the rogue waiting to gank you actually, just did this to someone doing the escort in ashenvale
---
This was for Snapchat but thank you
---
Suffixes are generally going to be leveling items, but absolutely true!
---
Just sad and tired.
---
You can change the options in Questie so it only shows you where quests start and not where to collect the things for it.
---
Why are tanks so impatient these days?
---
When I have 3.5k total mana, they don't let me mana up past 1.5k before they charge into the next pull. So then I can't even make half use of my moonberry juice.
---
And it's typically the same tanks who won't go sword+board because "lulz I won't top the meters then".
---
i just checked alliance for rp and there is no rp anywhere.. even stormwind
---
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be looking at.
---
I don’t believe parody laws apply to products like this.
---
Nobody can watch someone farm for very long.
---
Nobody levels as resto so he could definitely have that axe
---
It's more like rolling on something you're not high  enough level to use yet but definitely will. 
---
Say if herods helmet dropped and two warriors want it but one is a few levels lower and can't use it yet, does the higher level warrior automatically get it?
---
What’s so good about this cat? I’m not a hunter player, enlighten me.
---
Good idea!!! Thank you
---
Lol you are delusional if you think a class that can use mail in 2 levels will be black listed for needing on it. Go back to retail.
---
I made a gnome tailor with the name "Luxury" just for that reason.
---
Yeah but that works both ways. The problem - as it was explained to me at least, I really don't know - is that the target has a leeway that makes you avoiding attacks nearly impossible. But again, I'm not sure so thanks for the clarification.
---
A noob
---
Just spec reckoning and you can 1-shot those pesky rogues.
---
i may be misremembering but it was a problem for like a half day, and then slightly the next day
---
&gt;But as a leveling warlock all you do is press 3 spells and wand with your pet attacking.. 
---
That's not true. You're either not really familiar with leveling a warlock or you're deliberately not being truthful to bolster a point.
---
There is no cap you are going to hit on regen that is going to be worse than wearing Int or Stam gear. Stamina, while increasing your mana pool, does not make you kill mobs any faster when you run out. Int, while increasing your mana pool and very low amounts of spell crit, mostly does nothing to help you kill mobs faster. Stam and Int can help you go longer without needing to bandage/eat/drink/etc, but eventually you run out. Regen makes it so you don't.
---
Spell damage helps you kill things more efficiently and faster. And is preferable over regen because of something like A) things die faster so you don't need to worry about health and b) drain life heals more so you don't have to worry about mana. Regen is the single best stat to keep you always killing after spell damage.
---
Believe it or not, there are times when a pull doesn't go as planned and you are forced to use more mana or health than going infinite in killing mobs. 
---
Sometimes you go after mobs that are higher level because that's what the quest asks and you don't go infinite with your health and mana. You ever get ganked? 
---
As a Warlock, you essentially never concerned about how much mana/health you use in a pull, but how fast you get the health and mana back and killing again.
---
Benediction!
---
Light yourself on fire
---
What if they never have to sleep because of the OP?
---
In your first comment here you are literally gatekeeping peoples achievements. Eat my entire asshole.
---
Can you fly Bobby?
---
Yeah this definitely happened to me in the barrens... Some mage was AOE'ing the prowlers and I was running by towards Ratchet. I don't even think I used a spell or ability, but they all turned to run towards me even though they were already tagged to him.
---
They don't want to look like an apologist.
---
Not training every skill available.
---
Correction, you can heal just fine with literally zero talents points spent anywhere with a decent healer set.
---
New York Taxis be like:
---
Because discord sucks.
---
No it's just an addon or write on a stickynote. Theyll just see "That person is ignoring you." in red.
---
&gt;He then stopped chasing me, and tried casting Lighting Bolt (?) to finish me. So I stopped kiting, and just did auto attack.
---
You can use feign death to make him detarget which will screw up a cast. Also, you can keep auto attacking while kiting if you run at the correct times. Here's a random guide: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hcwl8qkeFM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hcwl8qkeFM)
---
There's no "2H weapon" skill, there are: Polearms, Staves, 2H Axes, 2H Swords and 2H Maces.
---
It actually makes sense for shaman whose a HYBRID class. 
---
Paladins do the same shit except they are one of two classes that CAN wear plate so they generally dont.  
---
Also most plate gear is statted for warriors so most of the time you only see paladins roll on plate gear if itd perfect for them or if they are retribution.
---
On the flip side of things, shaman even as enhancement need pretty much every stat.  They prioritize some stars over others in specific builds.
---
But its unrealistic for people to run end game dungeons and think that they are "owed" gear just cause it's their bis.
---
Maybe the shaman is respecing to elemental or resto and was only leveling as enhancement.
---
Maybe just accept that you wont always win gear that drops that you want?
---
Noone seems to mind when shaman are giving the melee windfury, or giving mages or priests mana spring, or even using earth shock to prevent enemy casters from shadow bolting your ass.  Or frost shock to prevent that scarlet mage from running off to get his friends.
---
Noone seems to mind the subtle influences that shaman and paladins bring to help the parties.  That is until those hybrid classes roll on gear then everyone gets up in arms about them rolling on "their BIS gear".
---
Alliance hunters are in a shit position there, but horde hunters (like myself) have [a \(better\) alternative](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19120/rune-of-the-guard-captain).
---
So it'll be purely out of spite when I do it.
---
Whats with the shitty pepe meme from nazi germany?
---
Can you share your Berserker Stance&gt;rage&gt;defensive stance macro? I tried making one the other night and it kept failing on me

Over 300 upvotes and locked...here's mine. Add it to the pile.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cub3p2/why_even_ask_about_another_players_gear_how_do/
---
i thought it was pretty clear sarcasm, very blunt
---
So I see a lot of people saying to switch off enhancement at 40. Claiming it’s a meme spec. But I want it to be a meme spec. That being said, how brutal is enhancement to 60 and playing one at end game raiding/dungeons? This is my alt btw.
---
It's not like it'd completely kill the mystique to throw a few classes a bone so every raid wasn't "bring mages and warriors or gtfo."
---
like, you don't like the program? or do you just not like engaging with other people from your guild?
---
You seem to have mistaken a Rat for a Rogue.
---
Rats are one of those very few mobs you’re able to one shot, Rogues are a player class choice
---
Just because some people only care about efficiency doesn't mean everyone is. I've been taking my time leveling and enjoy logging in everyday, even if it is just an hour or two to get some quests done.
---
Reminder that what made Vanilla so great was not end game, but the journey to get there. Not surprised that people who raced to 60 are getting bored.
---
Your a retard because the spawns are only different by a time of a few mins maximum so either bring actual facts or fuck yourself :)
---
Because your guild sucks.
---
If you make a character with no jaw you should be mute for the entire game.

Name a better duo than Alliance and Sociopathic behaviour
---
I know you said generally but the Abyssal plate pauldrons of striking disagee :p
---
This is exactly the reason why I, as a druid, have decided that if I'm going to have any chance of more or less guaranteeing a stable, consistent run, then I'm going to have to tank it myself.
---
I would much rather heal it instead, or even dps it, but as I progress further and further, I'm seeing more and more Whirlwind Axe "tank" warriors charging in just like you said.
---
Where did this sentiment come from and why is it being so heavily upvoted. The literal only way you can run out of quests before 60 is if you dont touch any instances and you skip any of the longer quests. I just hit 60 last night and I have the full chains in both eastern and western that I haven't touched. With plenty in sili and a few in wintersping. 
---
Do your damn dungeon quests people.
---
If you run dungeons with warlocks that have hellfire for aoe bring that PW Shield out. It’s amazing when a priest realizes that and puts it on you. If they don’t have hellfire you probably want normal heals. I had a priest that continuously put shield on me when life tapping. Not that useful  (but I get the reaction - fast health drop and all). 
---
Also if you’re a mage it’s more likely the warlock wants food than water. If we life tap and drink and eat we usually get healed long before mana is filled so it’s usually better to go balls out on lifetime and then eat.
---
Why would they not use a shield?
---
I took over as guild leader for a guild in a different game. Community was great, everything was awesome, old leader was a pleasure. Problem was that you could never make jokes about him ever. Would always go south. So newer members who didn’t know any better were always ready to be put on the chopping block if they said the wrong thing at the wrong time. Whether it’s real life or a game, people like having the “office punching bag”. Someone in a leadership role who understands this and can take it without getting their feelings hurt can really bring a community together.
---
Sounds like you are well passed Shaman 101 then. Yes, rank 1 LB is a mainstay even at higher levels because of its cheap cost and quicker cast time versus higher rank bolts. It also has higher range than shocks, of course, but you already knew that! Best of luck, and feel free to PM me with any more specific questions or theorycrafting.
---
someone who uses their mouse to move. All those keybinds you give up for movement when you can just hold down your mouse button...
---
Holy shit! FPS Doug lol. Man this brings me back.
---
Shadowlands ?
---
Prowl is pretty cool combined with eyes of the beast, though.
---
This is further compounded by the fact agility gives shamans 1% dodge per 20 and 2 armor per point, acting as offense and defense.
---
Ideally, gear will still have a large amount of AP and crit from stats or bonus'.
---
HAHHA fuck you chode having ass mother fucker. Go BaCk To ReTaIl. Haven't been there since wotlk. Shit the fuck up.
---
Pallys don't have absorbs
---
These used to be godly back in the day,  but didn’t the weapon skill nerf go into place before 1.12 making them less useful?
---
Either way, congratulations! It beats my searing bow epic drop by like 20 fold :)
---
&gt; i can see the damage. 251 physical (391 absorbed) (critical)
---
You broke the shield, so it's probably a different function that handles it at that point.
---
 just play normally. if you're new, you need time to learn how to play your class. getting used to being bailed out by a high level player just teaches you bad habits.
---
It's amazing how much life gets in the way compared to 10-15 years ago.
---
Also, if you shoot a mob that casts or shoots, and then run behind a wall, tree, etc, the mob will run to you.  
---
It is called LoS or Line of Sight pulling, and will be used in dungeons to pull a group of mobs into a place that it safe to fight them.
---
Ew horde
---
This cat is overrated and causing hunters to try to farm it religiously for little reward. Spell pushback in pvp is effective up to the second hit ( Or so its written). If you cant get this, a stranglethorn tiger has 1.3 attack speed and with frenzy up is 1.0. Also the bats from zulgurub once that phase releases, and a wind serpent are very good pets.
---
No, I still place the blame on flying. Mob congestion doesn't effect my perspective of size. Travel methods do.
---
&gt;You spend the majority of the time in relevant content grounded
---
That's one of the issues really. If you're only interacting with the world in "relevant content" then you aren't playing a large-open world game. You are playing something more like an ARPG, where you get from point-of-interest to point-of-interest through loading screens. Just replace the loading screen with an animation of your character flying in a straight line. That makes the world feel smaller, in my opinion.
---
Open world games are about interacting with non-relevant content sometimes. You wouldn't say Breath of the Wild should have more fast travel because sometimes you fight some enemies that don't have anything to do with the main quest. In that case you might as well delete the open world, and only have temples, then the Ganon fight.
---
&gt;People say flying makes the world feel small and point to Classic as proof, but on the contrary, Classic proves that flying is NOT the reason. The majority of us have already experienced what it's like to fly over everything, we've already had the illusion broken for years, and yet Classic still feels huge, sprawling, full of life, like a true fantasy world.
---
It's not that flying over the world makes it feel small just by doing it once (we didn't have this complaint after we took our first flight paths). It's the travel speed and skipping of what is in the world that makes it feel small. Take that away and you have a larger world to interact with.
---
Thank you. I’m new to the game and been leveling up. I know I can’t ride many mounts as a Tauren but I didn’t know which ones I could.
---
This whole time I thought it was just a big % increase to damage, not also auto crit central lol
---
the 2% water from the harvest was really so good, wish the horn thing gave water instead of bread
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGQDLBNge8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGQDLBNge8) is this something you're interested in?
---
Also, arcane shot doesn’t benefit from spell damage.
---
Sunday Service is the guild.  Mushroom Eater is his rank.
---
There's also a wolf, a bird and a plainstrider
---
Came here to say this. I had my raid gear for posing and certain fights where I needed more survive-ability or more sustain. That gear got put on for pictures, but you better believe my AH greens and dungeons blues were what I wore most of the time.
---
Low level - yeah who cares. 
---
High level- if you want to roll on healing gear, you should be HEALING the run. Else common courtesy is to ask the healer if he needs it before rolling.
---
and its not fair to the person that spent weeks getting to 60 being told "go play something different or you're not allowed to progress anymore" because they're not on the bleeding edge of efficiency.   
---
most of us are here to have fun, not to be the top of any charts or world firsts or being the most elite of the elite.
---
As a fellow new player, the revenge feels so good! Finally revenge-ganked someone for the first time last night, and it's very satisfying after they kill you while you're minding your own business &gt;.&lt;
---
I like how you took me saying I would do it until my poisons ran out after Gurubashi Arena, and that, in your head, became "multiple hours a day" lol
---
Frost shock yo.
---
it does, but only keyboard turning enemies or autorunning enemies
---
anyone actively controlling their player's facing direction with a mouse is more or less immune
---
Don't forget that one bubble of rested xp is only half a bubble of actual free xp, and the other half is representing the normal xp you'll earn as you move through the rested part. Also, it depends how long you're actually logging out for the night, some of us were staying online for every waking hour to avoid getting back in the queue. All told, taking a couple extra weeks while still logging a lot of hours is saving me maybe half a level tops? And there are plenty of high level dungeon quests I won't get to before 60, the zones I skipped at lower levels, and some high level quest areas that I may not actually need to finish.
---
Right ... Except most other classes have the same or worse Mana issues
---
Over 40% of a combat rogues damage are white auto attacks. SnD ABSOLUTELY should be used when fighting appropriate level mobs.
---
If you are fighting greens which die quickly the value is lost. A 2 CP SnD will drastically reduce your time to kill where even a 5 CP Evis can result in very little damage output. How many times have you popped a 4 CP Evis with the mob at 22% health only to be swinging at normal weapon speed without SnD from 8% health and down....
---
I'm currently speccing into 3/3 Imp SnD before murder or 5/5 Crit.
---
Yeah these used to be incredible. However not as sought after now. Still I believe it is pre raid bis for fury warriors.
---
Fishing buddy or tackle box were great addons. I have yet to find a working one for classic though. :(
---
I just use the standard click method for now.
---
Precious seconds will be saved!
---
auctionator
---
I'm a hunter and will gladly kill it just to piss people off.
---
No, there is a tipping point for when crit and sp outweigh the hit, its on every guild for every class, you are never going to see an improvement on dps when dropping something like 40 sp for 1 hit.
---
Thats good to hear.
---
Next I'm hoping for a blue post on the infernal bug.
---
No wonder the last warlock I fought who used pet bubble took sooooooo long to kill.
---
definitely not
---
For real.... I’m level 35 guildless atm but I’m sure there’s a good one out there I just havnt found yet lol
---
Print screen, then print the image, than take a picture of the print out on your phone, then share it on SnapChat, it isn't rocket surgery man
---
Literally the best dps class in the game in the current phase
---
7:3 is 70:30 lol
---
Victory at sea!
---
I've only played BfA, so seeing the differences between that and retail is pretty interesting. Hopefully a class clicks with me soon!
---
 no one cares
---
i don't think so cause these are going for alot of gold right now
---
and that's why i've been stocking up on popular twink items when they show up for cheap on the AH.
---
if my plan works i'll make a fortune. if my plan fails, at least i'll have some decked twinks. it's a win-win.
---
Well... good luck finding a private server that doesn't ban you for it. The term is called 'safespotting', if you google any of the main stream private servers you will find that their approach is very similar to Blizzards.
---
I was actually in this group and while I agree that the tank was doing very well, I believe the most impressive thing was that he knew exactly what way to go in the dungeon and even what to do for all of the quests. The sunken temple can be very confusing if you haven’t ran it a couple times or haven’t ran it for 10+ years like I haven’t.
---
Pet ability points are based on current level/loyalty only, there's no benefit to getting a lower level one.
---
&gt;The actual formula is (level)\*(loyalty-1).

Did he “git push origin master -f”?
---
it's "gear dependent" meaning it works in aq40/naxx gear, not "gear dependent" meaning you can do it at level 37
---
fucking idiots
---
Just change guild.
---
Find a guild with real people that interact and care with others.
---
It's not normal to have a guild with "mindless" bots who doesn't interact, that is not the "default".
---
I wonder what gootecks is doing right now.
---
heal prediction? as in, it tells you who to heal before you have to heal them?
---
come on man, if you want it to be that easy, try playing tic tac toe and just going first.
---
If only I hustled irl, like I do on WoW.
---
I think you're misunderstanding the comment. She's saying that the tank is so good at their job that they only require "a few heals". Probably referring to the madmen warriors who don't know how to tank with a 2h and when to use sword/board.
---
South shore. Arathi. Desolace.

congrats your class sucks at pretty much everything but raid heals

I was made in a lab xP don't relate.

I just go sit in the chairs inside and hopefully get someone else to join me, nice times.
---
I have my middle mouse keybound to a slot on my actionbars, whenever I fish I throw the spell in that slot so everything is 1 handed. Pretty sure there aren’t anything that actually helps you with gathering them by clicking but there used to be addons like fishingbuddy that track your catches and disable ambient noise so the bobber is easier to hear. There’s probably a version for classic out I just haven’t looked yet
---
You don't understand how hard it is to aim with cat paws.... WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THUMBS!
---
&gt;Does a lower level pet have worse abilities?
---
At a base, yes, they can. But you just need to train a higher level one long enough to learn the higher ability and then you can give the higher rank to your old pet.
---
I didn't say everything was shamans.  I said that they CAN USE every stat well, unlike a lot of other classes.  Again they are a hybrid class.  Not sure why this is such a hard concept for you to understand.
---
The only thing that I so understand from you though is that you:
---
1) Think that a month after launch when everyone is still sorely in need of upgraded that gear is earmarked specifically for you.
---
2) That your only way of debating someone is attempt at strawmanning them.
---
3) (Related to 2) You dont actually provide any ancillary evidence or points of debate in your rebuttal and pretty much just insult me. (Aka Ad Hominem)
---
All of these together make me believe that the only problem in your scenario is you.  You sound like an elitist entitled asshole who hates on anyone who rolls on gear you want.  And your response leaves me little desire to continue this farce of a debate so....guess what kiddo? You're blocked! Maybe next time you'll try using big boy words and not insult people with things like "more train wreck".  (Well not with me you won't, but maybe another debate in another thread with another person).
---
Hmm.....nah. Who am I kidding. LULZ.  You'll probably continue to be the vitriolic spewing, keyboard warrior you have always been.  People don't change.  Peace.
---
Damn, those thighs are mesmerizing
---
They are still awesome after the weapon skill change (as in best in slot before raid), just not the best in slot gloves period.
---
But I don’t remember exactly when they made the weapon skill change. It was during vanilla though (before TBC) if I am remembering right, which means it is likely in effect for us.
---
Not entirely true.  If the level difference is great enough, they'll see you coming from behind.  I don't know the exact numbers, but I've tried it, hoping to get a stun off in world pvp and if they're 20 or so levels higher they see me coming from behind.
---
oh. they interact.  guild chat is very active.  finding a group in guild works a lot.  everyone seems to be very helpful.   but no one gets on discord.
---
A druid can not re-stealth in combat like a rogue, which may change your conclusion (never been the rogue, only the druid).  From my memories, a rogue wants to stunlock a druid caught out of bear form.
---
Clearly a hunter item!
---
Time to take some LSD

I believe they are referencing Adolsaac Holtler, Wide Receiver for the Berlin Rams
---
I prefer Itemrack to Outfitter, thanks for posting this! I had been looking for a Classic compatible version and this one works like a charm :)
---
This, comments should be extremely contained, they risk going obsolete more than compiled code, which should be self-documenting and remove the need for traditional written explanations.
---
What's better ph for hunters?
---
Horde on my server are trash too. Saved this Tauren from an elite that was beating him down so of course he tries to kill me after that which did not work out well for him. No class.
---
I was the rogue Biggie in this group :) I added you as well
---
It made more sense when we were supposed to get Plainsrunning honestly... they said that it was overpowered and took it out of the Beta, but I'd love it if we could have it back in the same form as the Worgen "Running Wild" racial.

Cant wait to finish my invisibility trinket as prot pala, farm that 5 revenge crit hits on auto atack..... and farm some after-duell-ogrimmar-people on low hp, drinking and eating. Only to have an nutjob appearing out of stealth with his 2hand weapon, wearing a big yellow toilet helm, sending you back to the holy pope and disapearing right after that with a invi potion.

Found him by pure dumb luck walking to Ulda. My hands were shaking and I punted my then current pet half across the badlands
---
I don’t know what I was thinking, you’re absolutely right.
---
So? Id try again and again until im the one who gets him. Dont care about wasting time, its the layering randomness thats the problem.
---
Lion is the keyword there. He is looking for a wolf, there are only two wolves with 1.2, one in SFK and Deathmaw. Deathmaw is a rare, sfk ones are not, however they are low level. Thank you for whatever it was you were trying to contribute however.
---
Eh. I’m a little upset that they removed my post and didn’t remove the other 3 copies. But not at this guy for posting it. Just letting him know it’s possible it could get taken down.

Even better, ez-throw dynamite, so they dont have to worry about engi while leveling

That says a lot about you

They are the best item for that slot until Naxx is released for a non orc/hu fury warrior.

Im all for helping people,but how is dragging a lvl 22 through gnomer fun? Gnomer already takes pretty long at level, with 1 PErosn less, and 100 Yard aggro range on the level 22. I really have to ask Just why?

TLDR

Not bad.  Love the drowning method better though. 🙂
---
Vanilla p servers have been incredibly populated for over 5 years...

Wholesome thread of the day
---
One free Mana pot every 30 minute isn't going to break your character. Keep playing and have fun!
---
The context was "is elemental viable in raids". Having WF totem have nothing to do with elemental, people use resto or even enh for that. " Not everyone are trying to min/max" is not a argument for elemental. This just mean someone will inv you regardless or your spec/gear/class because they wanna fil the raid or they know too litte about the game so they have no idea what class/spec is good/bad.
---
The reality is Shamans do not have the tools to sustain their mana like other casters and go oom too fast. Warlocks have life tap, Mages have evocation and mana gems and  robe that give them mana on use. Shamans just have non of that you just go oom at the beginning of the fight and then you are useless.
---
And also i do make a lot of friends ingame. I am playing prot warrior and everytime i log in i get like 4-5 wisps to come tank for someone, so it seems i am doing fine.
---
Alliance player here. But I want to thank you for being a tank on behalf of all players. /salute
---
Now I am really curious about who that MagicEven person is.
---
It is easily the closest thing to crack I can think of. I dont even think I enjoy playing.. but God damnit, I must.
---
No, an asshole is a person who obsesses over every last stat optimization as if it really matters all that much.  The raids are not that hard, you don't have to min/max your group to complete them.  The first people to finish MC in Classic had a bunch of sub-60s in their group.  A boomkin or a shadow priest is not going to prevent you from completing a raid; they'll just be your convenient scapegoat if you wipe.
---
"Purposefully chooses" a sub-optimal spec?  You sound like a fucking idiot.  Not everyone is worrying about raid comps when they make a character.  Most people play this game for fun and choose a class they enjoy playing, instead of worrying about some autistic asshole will think about their DPS at level 60.
---
long shot but is this stonespine?
---
Don’t ask me I just tell people to break shit and make the devs fix it for a living
---
Yes I would like this. 
---
Blizzard please give me this. 
---
Thank you, 
---
- A very slow walking cow
---
We will, thanks!
---
Considering this is phase 1, you can use your standard 31/0/20 or 30/0/21 Ele/Resto builds and swap to a staff for your 2H weapon when you really want some extra melee damage. AFAIK axes/maces have the exact same damage as staves at this stage of the game. Slavedriver's Cane is even 3.9 speed (slower than Arcanite Reaper's 3.8 speed) and perfect for burst.
---
I suggest putting Enchanting on an/the alt, as that will allow you to mail your greens to it from every other character, giving more bag space on your main.
---
Remember that the next time you roll through a stoplight, or don't put your seatbelt on because you're just driving 10 feet.
---
Remember that the next time you toss a wrapper on the ground, instead of in the garbage, or listen to a song on YouTube from someone other than the registered copyright holder.
---
Remember that the next time you connect to an unsecured WiFi from next door, because the place you're at doesn't have free WiFi.  
---
Remember all those times you clicked "I am 18" to look at porn, even though you were not?  Criminal.
---
If you still stand behind your ignoramus statement, I expect to see you at the fucking gallows by noon.
---
At my current +heal and spirit, my rank 4 Heal heals for 3.54 heal/mana whereas my rank 1 Greater Heal heals for 3.59 heal/mana. So it's more mana efficient and because it heals for more, it allows me to space my heals out more and regen more mana.
---
I assume when I get more +heal, this could/will change, but in the current state, do you still agree with what you just said? And if yes, why?
---
That quest is good exp because you kill a lot of mobs. But its 4 or 5 levels lower than the other quests nearby so it makes sense to do early.
---
Doing it also means you have the flight path for BFD.
---
What an absolutely moronic statement.
---
I didn't get the "X doubt" meme until just now...
---
take my upvote -.-
---
Honestly you are going to hate this suggestion but this is how I used to do it back in the day and I never ever regretted it. Keep lfg channel open to spot BRD groups and then just sit at the timbermaw place (probably 56 or so is a good time to do this) in far northern felwood (west side of the road). Killing the deadwoods there gives you faction with the timbermaw, and pretty much everyone wants faction with them. That way you get xp and rep.
---
Melee Hunter BiS
---
The problem with Claw and Bite is that if you have a cat that you want to teach Prowl and Dash to, and you want to teach it Growl (which is essential), that's 5 abilities, and it can only learn 4.
---
So you have to pick one ability to skip. I chose to skip claw.
---
Yep I know about how private servers overtuned, I just hope Blizzard give those of us who wants that experience a chance too is all. I'm sure there's enough demand to justify it as a good business venture.

When you introduce a game that won’t have an honor system or any PvP maps for months this what you are going to get.
---
World PvP for fun until honor system hits, then high levels will be more inclined to kill others at their level.
---
Phase 3 is a very long ways off.
---
Lok’tar og-et outta here boiiiiiiiiiiiii
---
Fair enough, I don’t look at the statistics. :)
---
Hahaha I’m the same way. I’ve been playing alone for the most part unfortunately. People will pm me and be like “yo you tank?” And I’ll be like “idk man I just kill shit”
---
Same concept goes for people like Shroud pubstomping a BR game. He's killing 8 year olds on stream but that doesn't mean he's compensating for his "daily miseries." It's just how open pvp is. You don't lose items, experience when you die.
---
There's some skill involved but the floor is really low. Pvp in particular is really just time. My #1 wish for classic is that they eventually do classic+ and introduce a new system for pvp rewards
---
A letter to you in response:
---
Totems are not recallable, learn the game. We have to either place new ones of the same type or allow them to expire. A good shaman will be placing totems behind the group/where the next pull will be so as to not pull things ahead. Shit happens though and all party members must have their head on a swivel, all of them.
---
They’ll fall in love and here’s the bottom line: our trio’s down to two.
---
Or i just don't like attention whores.

you should always just opener and immediatly snd.  its cute you think that a evis is going to be better than 30% attack speed

How much mana did you get back though?

Thanks man. This comment made me feel more comfortable doing what I'm doing.

Fucking huntards you're never safe...

Yeah, people act like WoW in its prime isnt.. absolutely the pinnacle of mmos. There's a reason the term 'WoW-killer' was coined. 
---
Only WoW could kill WoW, and only WoW can bring it back.
---
join a guild idiot
---
It's a hand me down.
---
Felhunter for casters, succubus for melee.
---
Felhunter is best for stripping buffs and counterspelling.  It also has high natural resists.  Succubus has higher dps and a hard CC.  Killing the succubus over the warlock lets him free cast.  Killing the warlock means you get dots+fears+succubus beating you down.
---
This sub gets more cringe every day but it is Reddit after all
---
It's fine so long as you dont have a rogue in the group but if you are needing on a dagger against a rogue you are just an asshole.
---
It does. I played a warrior and a warlock as well before you say anything. Easily the best tps ever.
---
Its also not a trash clown spec that takes up a spot a valuable player could be in.
---
imagine thinking theres any display of skill in ccalssic lollllll

---
Healcomm for the predictive heal amongst healers.

If  you think the pvp skill ceiling is higher in retail than vanilla you clearly haven't played both versions of the game.

Raging berserker’s helm

Whenever I do random kind stuff for people, and they thank me, I tell them they can thank me by paying it forward and doing something for someone else, and telling them to pay it forward. 
---

---
King's Honor
---
Yeah for every successful 2H tank, there's been far many more wipefests.
---
Just seems that they watched a streamer + buddies do it and he thinks well if they can, why can't I? But yet they don't pay attention to some very significant details. These melee cleave groups(I've seen one) are comprised of 2-3 warriors(so they can taunt off of each other), 1 shaman in the group for Windfury totem, 1 tank of some form(possibly a druid), and one of something else.
---
So not only is the group composition very deliberate, but every player is also engaged on voice comms on discord. All their moves are co-ordinated and everyone knows what everyone else is doing at any given time. Their pulls are aggressive but they are also constantly communicating.
---
That's something you don't get with the garden-variety pug group. There's just far more to it than just charging in and just hitting all your AoE buttons.
---
Oh ye I hadn't considered that
---
Word. Thanks for the respectful reply.

"Like what?"

"Maybe someone up there is wondering what it's like down here."

In my experience, I actually cant name single thing I didnt like more in TBC. :D

So many tryhard dipshits talk shit about tanks keeping aggro or controlling mobs when they do these things. Next time I get flak I’ll walk out on the group. Fuck you.
---
👎
---
yeah but they can instant kill you again and never get off the boat
---
So what exactly is the goal? Earning money? Getting access to your account? Something else?

Imagine calling specs used by top players of this game "clown" specs.
---

I feel like this is missing some context. Youre a lvl 60 attacking Xroads and youre getting mad when theres some guys protecting the little level 15's from your bullshit? Did I manage to hit the mark?
---
Ok but I have so now that we got that out of the way you can explain why.
---
Those 10% bonus healing talents are weak on Shamans and Druids for the exact reason you just mentioned. It's why 30/0/21 hybrid builds are so popular, even among raiders.
---
However, there's no reason *not* to take it if you're going for a full Resto build.
---

Thank you for the reply! Have you noticed anything not working? I know during my time using it on private servers the “range calculator” feature or whatever it is called in the addon to calculate if a target you are attempting to heal is in range or not before you try to click their name and get let down was not functioning properly and would tell me they were in range.
---
you must be new here

They should have a meme flair that you can filter out (do they already?)

Oh man I kill every hunter/warlock pet I see.
---
They always just end up standing there like "The fuck?"
---
I also like charging a lowbie, canceling target mid-charge to prevent auto attack, walking away so they think they're safe, intercepting back to scare the shit out of em again, and *then* leaving em alone
---
Same for me on my Shaman

I've seen/heard it mentioned in quite a few guides, might be something that wasn't really used outside of hardcore raid guilds on pservers.

Because I've only ever heard it as a super hardcore raiding build because of what you have to give up to get both talents
---
You’re not fucked and it’s not that big of a deal. Sure it’s useful, but it’s not game breaking. And there are a lot of unique items like this in classic, so just be smarter as you move forward with quest rewards.
---
I am a simple man.  I see quality shitpost, I upvote.
---
For sure, but 6 seconds without being attacked lets you get out of combat.  So a druid can Entangling Roots then just run for 6 seconds, cat form/stealth.
---
That grain fucked em up good
---
My friends and I would delete your hearth, kill you and run you into the chimney in alterac. Generally kill you where your corpse was in view but you weren’t able to Rez. No hearthstone meant you couldn’t use the stuck feature (at the time) only way out was contacting a gm.
---
I am well aware of Shaman's skills &amp; abilities.  In regards to your first assertion in your reply, are Shamans viable in raids?  They sure as hell are viable.  I think what you may be trying to argue is are they optimal.  Two different things entirely.  I never claimed they are optimal, but are they viable?  Let's look up the definition of that word:
---
adjective
---
capable of working successfully; feasible.
---
Objectively speaking, yes Elemental Shamans are in fact viable in raids.  If you're min/maxing because you belong to that 1% of top tier progression raids and your group has strict requirements for gear and/or DPS then maybe not.  I don't think that's what this post was about however.
---
Mages are designed to be the master class. Please quit crying.
---
Tank - Mining/engineering, flipping to herbalism/engineering at 300 engineering is fine.
---
DPS - Engineering + X. Engineering is too strong in PvP and PvE, and secondary can be able to fuel your engineering, or help you with consumables.
---
And it won't get any better because now dev are explicitly taught to not write documentation until their software is fully functional (agile software development value). And when it's functional they're given new shit to work on.
---
Thank god IDE are getting better.
---
Downfall of WoW wasn’t until Cata though? 
---
WOTLK got them to their highest subscribers and fell immediately after cata came out.
---
&gt;	Or worst case Ontario, 
---
Whatever you say, Ricky.
---
You've stalled with three useless comments already, and as a bystander who is also in the camp of seeing int as less valuable than spirit/mp5 I'm dying to hear your argument at this point. Please do go on.
---
Not sure that matters much while leveling. I don’t expect priest healers to level holy and I don’t expect warriors to level prot.
---
These dungeons aren’t hard.
---
It's pretty hard to blame people for wanting to do some damage.  And AOE leveling is scary as shit when you aren't 100% sure you know what you're doing.
---
well im glad someone told me this ive put in two tickets and a third one in the pipes for 4 days now and i dont think either one of them read my ticket just telling me to relearn the profession at the trainer which ive already done
---
I think he/she was specifying an order
---
Why didn't they just reuse the spell icon from the spellbook?
---
East?
---
Not reliably and consistently. Most other options involve farming items for selling on the AH, which even now on many servers is still unstable. You could make a ton or it can be flooded and you wasted your time.
---
False.  Can see his inside.
---
Help!!
---
In fairness, doctors have to be in super dark rooms to analyze X-rays because any extra light causing glare could cause them to overlook something, albeit minor, or potentially make them see something that isn't there. Just them doing that to ensure the most accurate possible readings. 
---
And there is some science to support the idea you shouldn't stare at a screen in an otherwise dark room because it can cause your eyes to become "lazy" and """can""" cause long term damage from staring at a single light source in an otherwise dark environment, but usually it's just short term of yours eyes just sucking ass at adjusting to changes in lighting for a bit which can potentially cause issues, particularly if theirs a sudden dramatic shift in the screens lighting from dark to super bright all at once which can be hard on your eyes, but all of this does depend on the person.
---
Classes are more balanced but that doesn’t make things more difficult. You could argue it makes it less difficult. Everyone has mobility, interrupts, defensive cooldowns - it makes things less punishing and more binary because the matchups are so similar. Also why are talking about 1v1s? Those are never balanced.
---
Well what about the zone north of booty bay? That place is the best! You should try that one!
---
Grate! Also awesome name!
---
Lol it's funny when. People say that horde/Ally only gank/take unfair fights. Bitch please. Each faction does exactly the same thing to each other. Wpvp is rarely fair, get over it or reroll on a pve server.
---
there’s like nowhere for horde to fish in their zones. thunder bluff has a literal puddle
---
This is due to an increase in speed to kill. You can potentially increase the XP per hour you gain when solely grinding mobs as ele is very consistent when compared to enhancement. However, the difference is not that great and you should play what you enjoy. Ele is the stronger option for AoE so if you are planning to dungeon DPS this should be considered as well.
---
Yeah, warriors have no mana at all.
---
It was up for a minute and I got chimped pretty hard for suggesting wrong think.
---
This one has found their calling.
---
Am I the only one who feels like a trash tank because NO ONE gives me 2 seconds to gain aggro? 
---
We’re not asking for two sunders. Just two seconds.
---
Basically as DPS be more concerned with survival and success of the group and less on speed and DPS meters.
---
Note that block gear is pretty useless on warrior because shield block will bring you up to 100% anyways. But if you're looking for a list, here it is: https://classic.wowhead.com/items/min-req-level:60/max-req-level:60/class:1/group-by:slot?filter=195:44;1:1;0:0
---
You’re a cruel one
---
From a business standpoint, yes. Subscribers peaked in WotLK or maybe it was immediately after Cata but steeply declined after. I don't personally believe that the game was the best at that point though.
---
To make tremor work really well you need to watch the enemies cast bar. You need to drop it when fear is half a second or less from finishing. This enables the first tick of tremor totem to apply the same time fear gets applied. 
---
Cast it too late and you'll get feared. Cast it too early and you'll miss the first tick and have to wait the 5 seconds for another tick and pray you're still in range of the totem.
---
They added a new zone called Silicon Valley
---
So like need and greed, the two options you can choose? If somebody rolls need cause they “need” the money they should reevaluate their reading-comprehension skills.
---
Klar
---
Always Be Closing
---
Pepe is french?
---
If you make friends with a mage, water isn't a huge concern. If you like enhance, then there's no major reason to switch. Ele has more consistent damage and doesn't rely on RNG for bursts.
---
As I’ve learned from this sub, many people are SUPER uptight about loot at low level because they are trying to scrape and save for their mount at 40. Once people get that, they chill out.
---
Will do thanks.
---
WoW: Classic - just the way I remember it!
---
I did 2 full runs today and 2 yesterday. When you find a good tank, add them to your friend list as you both will most likely be going back there again.
---
Your char has been munching on DMT while you were sleeping.
---
Go into your Quartz settings, you can disable it from showing when a spell has no associated icon
---
Yes as long as someone is willing to carry you any class/spec is viable.  But if this was your point then it's really sad, cus I already said that in my first post, guess you didn't read it.
---
Did your character smoke DMT?
---
Because classic
---
I hear you man. My granddad passed away this morning, and I was able to get my level 40 mount today and dedicate it to him. Took some nice screenshots outside of the Stormwind Cathedral and did some nice RP stuff just for myself.
---
Our great passions and interests, like WoW, can bring wonderful comfort and I'm glad its something that can help stabilize you during a rough time too.
---
Yeah that’s what I was saying with the dealing 5/6 of the damage. The damage is lower to counter the faster attack speed. But yes I can’t imagine howl not being better than cat dps. They deal the same damage as cats and have howl last I checked.
---
Got mine like 2 weeks ago after camping for 20 minutes on a pvp server. For once I got lucky and now will lose every roll for the rest of the expansion. Lol
---
Primarily, it takes being reported, to be noticed, to get that ban.
---
Him jumping at precise intervals, a few seconds apart, will get noticed.  He'll get reported, and maybe get banned.
---
My solution is much more elegant.  My keyboard has programmable macro keys.  The macro is executed, on my keyboard, not on my computer. This bit is important.  A program running on my keyboard is invisible to Blizzards Warden program.  I programmed a macro as follows:
---
&lt;I press the key, to get the macro started&gt;
---
Jump
---
&lt;wait 20 seconds&gt;
---
&lt;wait 3 minutes&gt;
---
Inch forward
---
&lt;wait 5 minutes&gt;
---
inch backward
---
&lt;wait 1 minute&gt;
---
turn right
---
turn left
---
Then I have the macro loop for however long i need it to loop.  No one's noticed since launch....
---
Let’s start one man, if your horde that is. Other wise down with you! Lol
---
This post hits it right on the money.
---
Druid tank here. I'd say the hardest thing about tanking in Classic is babysitting the 3 DPS. Marks mean nothing to them. Tanks needing a few seconds to build threat means nothing to them. It's really making me just want to quit or switch to some other class. I honestly spend most of my time questing solo or grinding to avoid dungeons, and I chose to level a tank specifically to run dungeons.
---
Why you gotta be a dick though
---
I joined rppvp because there is less ganking and griefing. I have played for weeks now and I have not seen anything remotely close to RP. Fine with me cause I will never RP at all:)
---
But RPPVP is fantastic:)
---
You an interpreting my comments in the most asinine way possible.  Obviously if nobody else can possible use it, roll away, that should go without saying.  You are just being purposely obtuse to keep a pointless argument going.  I am freaking Hunter main for crying out loud. What, I hate my own class?
---
Thank you for the reply. Something I've always been a bit confused about is if mining provides all of the appropriate materials for leveling engineering. Is this the case or am I going to have to spend a ton of gold to progress?
---
You can ride the ZG tiger, ZG raptor, and rivendare death charger. Brew fest mount not in classic
---
Coulda sped this up a lot
---
I literally did skip STV this time around, I'm lvl 41. There are lots of other zones.
---
So, with effort, warrior isn't *that* bad to level anymore.
---
However.
---
I could blindfold myself and play with my toes and level faster on my hunter than I can try-harding on my warrior. I think a lot of the griping comes from *comparative* ease of leveling, not objective.
---
Thanks! I started my first ever rogue last night so this is perfect timing :)
---
3 years away probably.
---
If anything they would just resurrect partially built content, not limited to but including: hellfire peninsula (was scrapped and brought out in TBC), Karazan crypts (never used, you can ghostwalk through the gate and explore it even in classic), Emerald Dream (I am sure they can figure it out to not make it look as goofy as it was).
---
There was systems put in place for player housing, but they didn't know how to make it work. I don't want it to be like Garrisons, I don't want people to "phase" into their own garrison. Do something akin to Aion or L2's guild houses, where there is a zone with the houses, and you rent/purchase the one you like, and can build it up. This would also serve as a trophy for guilds having a huge freaking castle, with trophies from boss kills on their lawn. Something everyone can aspire to, not to mention huge for guild advertising. Would also be a good meeting spot, can be just off of SW/Org, since there's already spots in those two cities which were set aside just for this reason.
---
Even with that, cloth typically is better is many slots in early endgame due to itemization. Look st bis lists, every healer wears quite a bit of cloth since it’s purely better.
---
Accurate
---
Hasn’t felt that bad, and remember that graph is also showing 9k level 1s compared to 1k for the horde.
---
Cool story tell it again
---
As someone playing a hunter I get really annoyed by this stereotype. The only stuff I need without asking is ranged weapons that are upgrades, because obviously I should be allowed to, ranged weapons are the core of the class loot-wise. Any other slot, if there's anyone else who can use it, I ask first.
---
Pretty much 95% of engi mats are from mining yes. There's a couple of cloth items too and that's it.
---
Those are my hands for sure.
---
The number of people smart enough to set anything up to keep themselves logged in, is rather small.  I'd be surprised if these people contributed to the queue time anymore than 10 or so minutes.
---
Seriously wonder if this is why raid content has been so easy even with seriously undergeared people?  Shield is terrible hpm so ends up being a panic button, effectively preventing tank from getting crit down when at low hp?
---
Damn girl, are those Amanih BOOTS???
---
I sure hope to god he says “nothing” - because as an Alliance player who loves fishing, I HATE that the second best fishing pole is part of a Horde-only quest.
---
Yea I mean that’s just wrong sorry
---
Well, everything is scary when learning a new class. Start small, and just add more and more mobs to the AOE pull over time, experience, and new skills.
---
I only level a Pally to 16 as I found a really good Horde guild. But I found myself having already little problem when dealing with three mobs at a time (not necessarily on purpose, lol). And this is before even getting Consecration. Once you start getting AOE skills, there's advantage to taking on more mobs at a time.
---
I think people are too focused on Ret builds because they are easier to understand and do pretty good single target damage. But Prot is loaded with talents designed to punish people for attacking them. The more mobs are attacking them at once, the more total damage is being dished out. And far and wide, at high tiers, Prot totally bests Ret when it comes to kills per hour.
---
ya i think you are on to something.  maybe we can organize a raid with as many people as possible and get them in discord.   thanks for the discourse!  it's been very helpful :)
---
Hey Mr. Warrior I see you got a big honking 2-hander there.  Would you like +5 str to bracers so I can get a skillup?  Oh you would?  Who would have ever guessed?
---
I'm not talking 2005-2006. Thats oldschool shitty players on dial up.
---
The new 2015-2019 meta is here to stay and dedicated players will DO IT ALL.
---
Dying because you’re occasionally getting ganked is ok; sometimes you’re the ganker other times you get ganked. The problem is that when playing on a server like mine where the pop is around 2:1 and many alliance are choosing to spam dungeons, you never get to be the ganker, you’re always just hoping to not get ganked. That’s not fun and I shouldn’t be faced with either this or “rOll NoRm4l if U cAnT HandLE Lel”
---
why?
---
How do I decide which enchantment is right for which weapon or enemy? My guess is flametongue for slow weapons rock biter for fast ones or when tanking. When do I use Windfury or the frost one?
---
I'm definitely going with DPS as I don't have the knowledge of dungeons and raids to tank effectively (I  kind of want to be a tank but I don't want to step on anyone's toes by being a terrible player)
---
You've been able to do that for over a week now
---
and here i'm creating 7min brd arena and angerforge runs or 3min vo'sh gajin runs without any credits :(
---
Yeah that’s what I’m saying. You won’t cast anyway so the difference isn’t going to be relevant very often at all. And when it is relevant you just spent 60+ hours to get an extra pushback on a single spell cast.
---
I've openly stated I'll let people die if they do that. I still haven't needed to follow through on that promise.    
---
And I let warlocks who do that life-tap and not bandaging/eating shit die. Heck, I've let one die multiple times. Lifetaps and hellfires all the while pulling all kinds of aggro. He alone has had more deaths than all other people in all my other dungeon runs combined because I refuse to heal stupid.
---
Not hard to look for him. Go up the ramp to the top don't aggro the first pair of mobs.
---
/target Jedd
---
(Macro that)
---
Spam that for about 2-3 minutes, if your target lights up, grats you found him.
---
He's a douche. End of story.
---
The mage's reaction when you put sagefish delight in the trade for water.
---
How is that known?
---
Thats...thats not how threat works.
---
Threat in vanilla and by extension, classic is reliant on single target dps.  The game wasn't built around AoE or mixed dps.  A tank can generate a lot of threat on one target and moderate on others.  Just enough to keep the pack from the healer.  When the dps is going ham on anything they see or think that Blizzard belongs in a 5 man dungeon against elite enemies, you are going to have threat issues.
---
If dps focused one mob then the next, no one would have threat issues and the tank would be using 2h vs shield based on damage incoming, not threat generation.
---
My solution is even more elegant. Cat
---
Loot is not everything while leveling. Those people need to spend more time focusing on grinding rather than crying for gear. We aren't talking about pre raid bis it's gear that will end us vendor trash sooner rather than later.
---
Fuckin devilsaur mafia
---
&gt; You made like 900g off of Devilsaur hide alone?
---
I have around 2k gold. Made 1,5k or so of it from farming devilsaurs, making devilsaur gear (from farmed and bought mats) and farming felcloth when the crater is too busy
---
Oh okay good. I can handle those. 80s more for 20 than morning glory and they also fill up hp. I was looking forward to those on Priest.
---
It takes a curated montage video against under geared enemies to make enhancement seem powerful in pvp.
---
This guy codes
---
The issue is finding that good thank 😂. The ones I get are super slow or demanding. I had one only do single mob pulls in a zf.
---
That sounds rough but good on you for trying.
---
You actually seem way more salty than me dude. I don't go to every single Gurubashi Arena, I have gear to farm. I attend 1 or 2 a day, so yeah, you're still a reddit re..... Also feel free to come over to my server, level to 60 and duel me any time :)
---
If you're interested, here is the [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/HXJa5jN9) with this WeakAura for you to use

Or just go into the Interface options and enable it.
---
It has strength though, surely something with agility and stam would be better even if its leather?
---
Same here, also my friend and I would 2 man it pretty far with 2 locks. 
---
Definitely more profitable areas, but it's fun and you can get some good drops if you are lucky. I think we usually were after skill books.
---
no, it was on a normal pvp server without any rp-ing , just some weird guys playing army
---
I'm not OP not a mage. I was asking about the "touch rooms" which I assume was intended to be "torch rooms".
---
My favorite is hunter show say “multi shot is part of my rotation” after popping sheeps or pulling another group
---
That whole " go to retail" thing people spam is incredibly retarded. You are just driving players to avoid PvP or actually quit the game so the community dies down... 
---
Say something like " you lose" that atleast makes the person you are fighting want to fight back and win and keep playing.
---
Yup
---
I bet people will say bfa was super easy compared to the 18.2 patch return of the space king lords
---
You expect the "2015-2019 meta" to 
---
&gt;lasts so long
---
You know, the "meta" which lead to MC clear in the first week?
---
The mage was definitely being rude, but I’m assuming by “help” he probably wanted heals more than anything so he could pull larger packs. Best to leave these negative types of people to their own business though
---
I don't even know what the fuck that is, so feel to provide some context.
---
You forgot Wetlands between Redridge and Duskwood.
---
Didnt know druids had ret aura and consecration with righteous fury...
---
Prot pally without Consecration isn't a prot pally.
---
So I should just go for it and try to be a tank? I have very little confidence in myself, but there's something about the idea of tanking that draws me.
---
Okay I'll take that advice on board! Engineering seems to be the go to.
---
You stalking me? If you want I can go start trolling you, seems like you are the type of insta-offended type that is so much fun to bait. I mean you white knighted like a champ on my trolling this morning.
---
Grats on using hamstring twice in a row?
---
that might be a bit harsh, I kinda like the little buggers, I just don;t like their foul oil leaking constructions
---
So you really think that being out of range of a guard is cheating?
---
Why is this labeled "Nostalgia"? This is happening right now...
---
That's the one :)
---
7 spells? Get better gear. Mage OP.
---
Level 35 is high enough to go talk to Nat and get the "fishing round the world" quest for Artisan. 
---
Some dangerous places for a 35 to venture, but it can be done.
---
Hell yeah man! Yin and yang
---
You mean John Mayer and company?
---
What a wholesome story! Love knows no bounds :^)
---
You're forgetting one important point.
---
Alliance are bitches, Lok'tar ogar.
---
Classic doesn't have icons for everything, so if you use addons that want to show an icon but there's none, it will show the default "no icon", which is sammy, as many others pointed out.
---
By the way, this easter egg already existed in Warcraft 3 and it was the exact same thing: no icon path specified: boom, Sammy.
---
Mages are really strong in pvp, sometimes you will need to downrank spells, use your mana gems, or mana potions. As well you have evocation.
---
Also remember instant cast spells (such as fire blast) chunk your mana hard.
---
Make sure you get +int gear as well!
---
Name him Dr Ibble
---
That's a very lengthy post just to be ignored because this sub is not for classic+
---
Go copy paste it to /r/classicwowplus
---
I think one of the biggest inherent problems that expansions have that they move people away from EK/Kalimdor and the rest of the world starts to feel barren. Like after TBC released there wasn't a reason for high levels to sit around in IF anymore, they had a special level 70 place that none of the low level players would see until at the very end of the game.
---
Big epeen small brain
---
Finally, the Alliance have figured out how to PvP. You're an honorary part of the horde now.
---
I'm pretty sure this macro works close to 100% of the time for me. It's just that sometimes I don't get the loot from pickpocketing before the opener goes off and I just have to double loot the corpse
---
Well.... I have never have friends who, nor would I ever befriend anyone that partakes in pranks. I hate pranks and I let everyone know that I do. 
---
So not only would I be pissed I would call them all out and tell them they are assholes. 
---
But I am a person that makes sure I have friends that have deep respect for one another ....
---
A lot of these icons don't show up in the game without the use of addons, or didn't show up in Vanilla. Since addons try to mimic how they work in Retail a lot of them end up pulling icons that don't exist, and instead of the "`?`" we're used to, we get Samwise and his amazing troll face
---
People who actually appreciate the art, sound and music that went into a game they paid real money to play.
---
Good to know. Any idea if Riposte, Ghostly and Hemo count as a weapon swing? I would guess so?
---
This I agree with. In PvP there just needs to be character templates that are balanced for PvP ONLY.
---
Nothing.
---
Np dude.
---
When you guys start MC it will eventually get better.
---
Cya
---
Why for healers too, I'm curious.. 
---
I'm debating between
---
- mining + engi
---
- herb + engi (lvl engi whit AH)
---
- herb + alchemist 
---
For my priest
---
There’s no one in that building that offers a quest
---
Thanks for the work you put in mang
---
I never went there, though. I did leave out a few DM runs to be fair.
---
RIP
---
He is obviously referring to Deadmines bro, I dont think anyone would try to tank for the first time in Dire Maul :D
---
No it’s not it happened earlier this morning.
---
You've been able to post as your classic character for awhile now.
---
To play devil's advocate a bit; do you not think they try to do this already? I think blizzard makes good expansions really, they just went too deep. Cata shoulda been wow2, legion wow 3. If you look at it this way the respective games kinda fit your rubric pretty well imo.
---
I will agree though the rpg elements are gone in retail. They started coming back in legion but that was just a jabait apparently!
---
I found it interesting how many overwatch heroes could directly map to a class/spec in WoW.  Tracer is the mage, lucio is resto druid, winston is bear druid, rein prot warr, brig holy pally etc.  Tons of them.
---
I was in a strat group the other night as a priest intending to heal. Cycled through several dps and tanks before a group finally settled. It had been about 40 minutes at this point but I had been making food and watching videos. I noticed a lock replaced a mage we had before. I say something along the lines of "I'm after shadow gear too if that's okay, I figure its polite to say before the run". The rogue, not the original party lead that invited me, kicked me. I waited 40 minutes for this group to come to scholo and was kicked for just asking if it's okay to roll on shadow gear. I whispered the leader and, surprise, no reply. I whisper the lock who actually replies like "oh I didnt care about the loot, hes just not as polite as me sorry dude."
---
Tldr be prepared to lose groups without warning for even asking about loot : (... 
---
I later learned, over the course of running brd and lbrs, that the guild the lock and rogue were in is already infamous for being incredibly toxic and aggressive after another run went south and both rogues dipped after a single wipe in an early lbrs pull and the other tank and dps mentioned similar stories with the guild. 
---
I'm clearly still salty.
---
I use vanakos, ur screen flashes when a listed persons shows up near you along with the reason they were noted. Great for finding the horde scum that 3v1'd you a week ago all alone.
---
I thought SnD wasn’t worth it until lvl 42? That’s what I’ve read, anyways.
---
Sounds like you're just spamming spells.
---
Mages in PvP setup for their kills by doing high burst spell successions. You have Mana Gem and Evocate as well.
---
What's a premade
---
I found the original World of Warcraft game manual in my closet a few years ago and it actually still had Plainsrunning as Tauren's mount.
---
Immaturity is also a common trait
---
Spitting is also acceptable at people who still the chest that you were clearing mobs around to get to.
---
Yeah, why bother with life-tap and bandages when you can just park your ass down with the other mana users.
---
Got an ELI5 for that explanation lol.
---
30k players is not going to be healthy once it goes down to 1 layer.
---
lowest pvp server has 8k players which is way over vanilla server pop...There are no dead servers.
---
Thanks! The curseforge one has been acting up for me and I’ve been missing it for a few days
---
DUDE!!!!! I played on Draenor back in Vanilla and have been trying to remember that guys name. Whats crazy was that i was in the same guild as him for a bit. It was like Society of the "something". Good times.
---
Why don't you just say "mana break" or "drink now" or something. You don't have to spend the whole dungeon growing a resentment for other players.
---
Glad you are enjoying yourself and basking in the beauty of Azeroth. How sad that it has to end in bloodshed, perhaps in a different time, a different world...
---
Ah, so he put him in the water prior. Not hating at all, I love tricks like this.
---
Provide some proof, or your words don’t mean jack. Where is somewhere that RELIABLY and CONSSITENTLY provides more g/hr?
---
Did you find an answer? I'd love to be able to switch my MH and OH back and forth...
---
I mean without getting too deep I would say it is neither good nor bad for the person being born.
---
Welcome to classic
---
it's fucking UBRS and he's ready for BWL. the reason this thread exists is because earlier this week asmongold's stream was specifically about this topic and video

Bro why are you coming at me like that??

^I ^did ^that ^last ^night

imagine getting lost in bfa :thinking:
---
People used to share accounts and log in and play whenever the other player couldnt.
---
Flying kills the world. Forcing high levels to hoof halfway across the world instead if bypassing everything was necessary to the feeling of a loving world. 
---
Allowing everyone to fly around and heli-drop onto nodes / quest mobs is some arcade game bullshit that had no place in an MMO.
---
I want to hear more...  what class did you choose, what spec are you using, etc...
---
Glad you are enjoying it.  47 years old here and spent untold of hours between 2005 and 2011 playing - now I'm back and enjoying it.
---
You generally downrank your spells for pve til you have good enough gear to be able to handle the higher costs. Though it's also a matter of resource management, for a longer fight you use a lower rank and for a shorter you roll with higher ones, your goal is to end a boss right at or slightly above 0 Mana. You'll get used to it after a while :)
---
Hang in there, it gets better! Good luck out there, and have fun!
---
I'm not sure what you are arguing.  I don't see anything wrong with what they have done.
---
&gt;	One could argue that more attack speed means more talent procs, but even then, the difference is marginal.
---
Still more damage.
---
True, but these days unless you land a really decent job, you need two incomes to afford to keep a roof over your head (depending on where you live).
---
Half the reason I was excited for Classic was General chat, its nice seeing the zones alive and talking again
---
add druid to your list of decision making
---
Sounds like you dodged a bit of a bullet not having to run with them. There are always assholes. Nice to be able to see their true colours early rather than halfway through a run.
---
Streamers are doing it now and BWL isn't even out.
---
Maybe if you are forced to hook up some just dance mat forcing every fatty to run to actually move in game it can become harder but imho i think mythic has hit a peak.
---
And yet I still have a ton of fun. 
---
While almost everyone in BFA bitches non stop. Enjoy your lottery cock savages &lt;3
---
It better come out in less than 3 years. The game will be dead by then. When phase 5 releases blizzard needs to start talking about developing new content or porting over bc. You cannot expect people to sit on the naxx patch for over a year
---
Ouch
---
And I should know that because some rando said so? How am I wrong?

Cant remember what they were called - but essentially enchants on your armor/weapons. Enchanting your weapon would make it glow light blue -&gt; blue -&gt; deep bright red, BUT after a few initial enchants your weapon could BREAK! Imagine getting your bis weapon and breaking it by enchanting and having to grind for it again :)
---
Yes it's usually played as hemo + mace specialization. It's extremely effective against mages because of prep + improved sprint. I'll be doing this with this build:

---
The nice thing is that it's also decent in pve because of the +hit and +precision. It's not quite as good as pure combat, but prep + blade flurry can pull some crazy aoe dps.
---
&gt; How long did it take for Rag to die after Classic Launch? 5 days? A week?
---
He died in less than a day after the world first 60.
---
&gt;When raids are released in retail, they are done in a day
---
Method has an entire website devoted to how long it took world firsts to occur after a raid's launch. The shorted (Emerald Nightmare) was still longer than Rag lived after world first 60.
---
Well, some people are just shit people and theres no debate. Stick with the good ones mate.
---
play an alt ?
---
&gt;E: is it bannable to get caught speaking to the other faction this way?
---
In vanilla/bc/wrath cross faction communications were against ToS. In cata they made it so it was impossible to do so. Anything you said would get randomly translated. I think this time around, not only is it fine, I'm pretty sure they think it's part of the experience as they would have just left the randomizer in otherwise since we are on the new engine.
---
i am using mana gem, and evocation has 10minute cooldown, i use fireblast.
---
i usually ice barrier, frostnova, cone of cold, fireblast frostbolt blink counterspell poly, not in that order exactly but those are the spells i mostly use.
---
and if i use then all my mana is 0 and if i use mana gem i can use icebarrier and cone of cold and its back to 0 again.
---
i dont know what im doing wrong
---
Venom! In mania!
---
Is twinking still a thing in retail?
---
Priests benefit most from the 5 second rule. When you haven't casted for 5 seconds you'll start to regen mana. This is why priests favor spirit on gear as they tend to heal infrequently, but with large heals. 
---
You can pre-cast and still gain natural spirit as long as you cancel the heal before the cast goes off. You can do this by moving.
---
As a priest your bread and butter heal will be Lesser Heal until you get Heal and then Heal will be replaced by Greater Heal at 40. These are big heals that are mana efficient for you and since they're so large, you don't need to cast them often. I use an addon called Grid which shows health missing in numbers, I usually don't cast a heal until the tank gets to the low range of what Lesser Heal/Heal/Greater Heal can heal.
---
#Health per mana as a Priest 
---
All calculations are max level base, no talents or +healing involved using the low-end range of the heal.
---
- Greater Heal - 2.769 health per mana spent
---
- Flash Heal - 2.179 health per mana spent
---
- Power Word Shield - 1.752 health per mana spent
---
- Renew - 2.366 health per mana spent
---
But there's talents that make Greater Heal 15%, same with Renew, same with PW:Shield which is an option. Then there's spell damage to consider and by using [these](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow) coefficients you will see even further increased gains. Let's consider a Priest with +200 healing through talents and gear, here's the health per mana again.
---
- Greater Heal - 3.499 health per mana spent (2,484 low end with +15% talent and 200*.857 coefficient
---
- Flash Heal - 2.4047 health per mana spent (913.8 low end with no talent and 200*.429 coefficient
---
- Power Word Shield - 2.1176 health per mana spent (751.7647 with talents and 200*.1 coefficient
---
- Renew - 3.2712 health per mana spent (1,341.176 health with talents and 200*1 coefficiency
---
Not only is Greater Heal your best scaling spell, it has two huge benefits.
---
1: Huge heal means that you can gain mana from spirit regen since you can often be outside of the 5 second rule.
---
2: Since Greater Heal has a great coefficient, you can downrank Greater Heal once you get a good gear set since +healing adds a lot directly to your heal.
---
So uh, yeah that's some Priest tips for you assuming Holy, but a lot can be applied even if healing as shadow. Shield is only something to use in an emergency, same with flash heal. Renew isn't bad at all if the damage is just a quick spike damage on DPS, and Greater Heal is fantastic.
---
you're calling vanilla private servers classic and you can't do that. in classic this isn't really anything more than what it is right now, an idea that 99.9% of people will never have the gear to pull off but some poor healers are going to have to work their dicks off so some dumb slut dw tank can try it a bunch of times. 
---
this community is pretty much dumb as shit, and things like this work for the right people, but 100% of the classic playerbase isn't the right people at this stage of the game. this is "when you totally outgear a raid" spec and the ilvl isn't high enough for fury warriors (who are the ones that benefit from this the most) to do enough damage to make this spec viable
---
and you still need a 1h/shield for some fights/trash/as a personal DR CD of sorts
---
Just go to arathi/alterac, there's roaming pvp raids on either side looking for fights during primetime, and pretty much everyone is ready/expecting a fight even if they're questing.
---
I'm 27 right now and have been taking about 2 hours per level. I know that time will go up once I hit 30 though
---
What a conundrum, the words Lay and Adderall in the same sentence
---
Back in the day it was Org.  These days I kinda prefer UC though.
---
thanks for your serious response....
---
I believe items have different chances to proc based on the unique spell. As far as shaman go though every AA has an opportunity for a WF. There is no CD for that. Shaman cannot get a WF proc off of proc attack though. This was changed in some patch early in WoW.
---
Assuming non-stop quest grinding, with dungeons.... 
---
Up to level 10, &gt;1 hour per level
---
11 to 20, 1 to 2 hours per level
---
21 to 30, 2 to 3 hours per level
---
31 to 40, 3 to 4 hours per level
---
41 to 50, 4 to 5 hours per level
---
51 to 60, 6 to 7 hours per level
---
I have never lost a frost mage on retail though
---
Does he spawn all over or just in a certain spot? I’m on a medium pop server so I feel like I might have a shot during dead hours
---
Money farming will be very minuscule at that lvl, especially if you don't wish to gain any more levels
---
I'd recommend leveling another class for a little while as you wait
---
Yup, better reroll to hunter!
---
I'll help you friend.
---
&gt;Emergent behaviour is any behavior of a system that is not a property of any of the components of that system.
---
Essentially what he is saying is that when classes are paired together they are allowed to behave a little bit different than they would on their own.
---
It's not a crit, it's a double damage modifier that isn't a crit
---
You need em to make fire oil which is needed to raid MC afaik. That's why it's more valuable on servers with more raiding guilds.
---
That proc threat is a nasty bugger. 
---
Which is why the one and only time I saw it on a hunter I about died laughing. *hunter was GM of server first guild and got it 2nd only to their MT
---
You mean when i told you to send me your address so i could fuck your mom and you never responded? Or when you challenged my friend to a fight and he gave you an address to meet, only for you to immediately panic and delete the posts challenging him?  Or when you tried to own the libs by making up Sasquatch facts?
---
except it's not about skill (as a tank this relates to keeping threat and fight mechanics,, both of which druids are great at). it's about warriors having a shield and shield block.
---
There's a script that's something like "/use bagslot3"  which will use whatever item is in that slot, you'll just have to keep the thing in the same spot in your bags
---
Is this on pagle by chance?  I’m almost positive this is the same tank that ninja pulled a boss in Zf, wiped us then left.   He also gquit our guild before he ditched us.  Was an absolute ass hole.
---
“Hello kind sir, may I interest you in a nice enchant for that weapon of yours? Very reasonable prices”
---
I think i joined his premade once. Needless to say im sure we got womped on. Honestly, the Horde dominated Wsg and AB on Draenor back in Vanilla. But Alliance would win AV a lot.
---
As dumb as it sounds since by instinct I would also say the stats outweight the +healing, but what I understand from having their stats priority list be so clear cut  I would tend to just take the +healing. Also I think your exemple is a bit too hard on the balance, since so far all the +healing I found in high level dungeon still gives you great to decent stats,cause it won't take the full ilvl of the item for the healing stat. 
---
Idk now that I have some +healing (280 atm) and having run quite a few dungeon with a full spirit gear till 55 cause I didnt look stats prio I really begin to get what is so good about downranking heals since I upped my heal rank 2 to 4.8 hp/mana which is pretty sustainable.
---
This is what makes classic so amazing. I sort of did something similar but with enchanting. I was drunk last night and mistakenly did my math on a bunch of enchanting materials. My first thought was crap I just wasted 5 gold and I am going to lose it all. After thinking for a while I decided screw it I am just going to go to the UC and ORG bank and just give away a bunch of enchants for free. After a few hours I had probably done 100+ enchants or so because people kept donating money and I kept buying materials off the auction house. It was pretty cool to see a high level roll up and give me a gold and pay for the next 5 free enchants for low level players.
---
I remember in TBC doing arenas as disc priest with a Hunter I forget what spec. Anyways manaburn and viper sting combos on the healer while dps was ice trapped was always funny.

I pity you, misguided being, for thinking that I am the enemy. Greater threats lurk in the dark just outside your sight, and they are after all living beings of Azeroth, both me and you. Pointy ears, overgrown beards, horns or green skins - they do not matter in the end.

I was talking about the DME farming method for healers + warrior. I wouldn't worry about getting engineering as a healer unless if I enjoy pvping for which grenades are just.. irreplaceable.
---
Lololol
---
I tip light feathers.
---
Nah , I'm a heal druid and i wisp something similar to any tank that is half decent , Tanks are so rare that is better to struggle healing someone who is not used to the job rather than not having a tank and slacking in OG spamming macro.
---
100% - I started a personal revenge list for people who ganked me in the PvP zones. Its only 3 people atm but i’d pay him to hunt them down while I farm gold!

Yup, I've heard this also. Gonna do full feral to level, but I'll likely switch to that close to 60.

Streamers that get funneled gear, not randos on quest greens
---
Well done for calling them out on this. That was just pretty of them.
---
That's not the issue, feign can be resisted, that's where the may comes into play.  
---
  The problem is feign doing nothing at all even when non resisted, reentering combat immediately for no reason, feign taking too long and feign being cancelled BY MOVING, things that already got a blue post as a "we're working on it", but this is such an obvious bug that anyone that played hunter should've seen it, and knowing blizz, they did see it and reported it, they just didn't do shit.
---
Tbh, their treatment of you seems pretty rough. I have a general hatred of Alliance but wouldn't go so far as to randomly spit on one, only randomly slap.
---
If you are looking to level all the way with a friend then having an alt is a very good idea.
---
dont even buy flametongue, or frostbrand, u only need rockbiter. later u can buy windfury to use in pvp, but for mobs is rockbiter 100%. it has been tested and documented by melderon.
---
Chuckles, I’m in danger
---
But how do you do repeat runs of the place, because there's no exit right? Is it best to put HS at Shadowpaw Village for farming princess?
---
Firstly a guide which should help: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warrior-tank-classic-wow
---
Second: MAKE FRIENDS. Not only will people LOVE having a tank on their friend list, people are far less likely to get annoyed if you lose aggro on a mob or something goes sideways.
---
Third: get the addon "threat plates" what it does is change the nameplate colour, based on your aggro on the target. While you're a tank, stuff that's whacking you will show up as green bars. If something isn't hitting you, it will show up as red. Makes it really easy to tell when something isn't on you so you can taunt/smack it a bunch of times.
---
Fourth: Don't stress out over AOE tanking. It's incredibly difficult even for experienced tanks. AOE tanking in classic is VERY difficult to manage. Pallies are THE best AOE tanks because their class is built around it.
---
As for knowing mechanics, bossfights, etc. Talk to people, not everyone has been through stuff before, others have and are happy to share their knowledge with you. If a group is treating you nasty, there's no problem with just going with a different group. Remember: they need to wait for you, you don't have to wait for a group typically. (yes I know that sounds really bad, but treat people with respect)
---
If you are unclear on maps, atlasmaps (another addon) has very basic maps you can run through. As well I am sure you can find youtube videos of classic dungeons and how to run around them.
---
Don't be fearful of CC as well. Very important in early end game dungeons to use everything in your toolkit as AOE tanking sucks, as well the incoming damage is going to HURT.
---
Typical CC marks:
---
Skull - first kill
---
X - second kill
---
Square - third kill
---
Moon - Sheep (mage)
---
Diamond - Warlock CC (typically banish, not usually used)
---
Star - Sap (rogue)
---
When you mark stuff up like this call for what you need. Remember you are the leader, you are expected to have a voice in the group. You also set the pace, so make sure you are watching healer mana. If unsure, ask if mana is good to go. Healers will know if they are good or not.
---
Stuff is going to go south, you are going to make mistakes, even after playing vanilla private servers for &gt;5 years as a tank, I still can mess things up. Laugh at it, and move on, we're only human. (Except for druids, they are animals....)
---
People like you are the reason itemization in retail WoW is so stagnant and boring.
---
I made a character on his server just to tell me he’s a fucking dick. I got your back dog.
---
Warlock quests early on
---
Uldaman.
---
Yes but their skill ceiling is high i would say. If you plan to pvp my best advice would be to get engineering, the gadget and grenades are super usefull for pvp.
---
I keep aoe threat fine as arms warrior with ravager lol!
---
Haunt Westfall.
---
This guy gets it. I have marks keybound and mark up every pack, no one hits skull...
---
Yup and the minor thing is mostly because Blizzard didn't used to allow minors to create their own accounts so kids had to have their parent's make accounts for them.
---
Maybe Elwynn.
---
I mean, I sure could have and that is on me.  I just wasn't in the hand holding mood that night.  Could have been vocal, but it was going smooth enough, and I was just happy to move on.  Objective was accomplished, in the end.
---
LOL send me a screenshot.
---
I needed this last week. I died a lot in tanaris on my Priest and mined almost zero thorium because I forgot it.
---
To be fair, multi-shot seems to have a mind of its own. Sometimes it'll hit anything within a 180 degree field of vision, sometimes it won't, sometimes it hits things further back that you haven't even aggro'd, the extra shots completely ignore LOS, etc.
---
Do. not. group. with. hunters. or. enhancers.
---
99% of these players are terrible and legit roll on the most random items. It's not even arguable anymore, it's just the sad truth.
---
Hunter main for launch—Thelma the Night Elf with Louise the pink Flamingo! Shout out from Skywall realm &lt;Sacred Samophlange&gt;!
---
It's not a huge part of what vanilla was always about. But hey, any excuse for you to get on your soapbox so you can feel superior (much like how I am sure you kill grey level players with your 50+ rogue and feel good at PvP for doing it). BFA doesn't have PVE realms either. War mode is on or off. Maybe you should know what you're talking about next time you want to be a typical condescending little twat.
---
+1 to this. Two days ago I healed an Ulda with a great group. I was able to bake a loaf of cornbread from scratch while throwing renews and an occasional heal outside boss fights.
---
Elemental doesn't become viable before level 39 because of the talent that reduces Lightning Bolt Cast time from 3 to 2 seconds. This is a HUGE upgrade. Most casters only have their main damage spell reduced by .5 seconds through talents.
---
As for gear, there's unfortunately not many great sources for ele shaman gear. You basically just want to find random mail pieces with int/stam on them, and possibly +nature damage if you're lucky.
---
Upvoted for having an original pet!
---
I mean... If the paladin is DPSing and rolling in spirit cloth over you, yeah, problem.
---
If a healadin is rolling in spirit cloth and you're complaining, what is your problem?
---
Wish I got into this when I was younger! Warrior of course! Currently specing into arms to help leveling but playing a tank role. I'm very excited about the honor killing system hopefully being implemented soon! I believe they can do so much with this game!
---
If you are on my server id totally be down to grind with you. I think my server name is mankurt or something close.
---
LOL. I'm shaking my head at the level of noobishness of the paladin.
---
What is better than these in naxx if you're not orc/human?
---
I thought the +7 to reduce glancing or w/e would be better than anything else regardless?
---
There I was, a newbie in the valley of trials along comes this bloke, hands me a 14 slot bag, not even a by your leave...
---
I love these random acts of kindness, reminds me of actually playing vanilla. Not sure if I received one of yours or there are multiple "bag-people" out there, but either way, thank you!
---
My solution is simple. My server is dead.
---
research the 30/0/21 spec
---
And this is absolutely alright. You can search for a group that does not care about getting progression done as fast and far as possible. Not to mention that every class is viable to a degree. 
---
Some may need you to invest more time, some less time. Some require you to use a certain spec. If you are a druid and you want to be viable in a raid, then you will need to go as a resto, same as a Shaman or Paladin. 
---
Classes have their strengths and weaknesses. If you are a Paladin you simply won't deal as much damage as a rogue or warrior and why should you? You can heal and have strong buffs, would be stupid for you to deal the same damage as them. 
---
You can also always play PvP, a retri paladin is quite good in being solo or doing PvP, just like a Feral Druid is a monster in PvP or a Boomkin.
---
My main was a Warlock back in the day and my AoE only came out on non-elites that got frosted so they were slow. Rain of Fire was almost never used.
---
I would just focus on the tank's target. When it was under 25% health, then I'd start to DOT the next target if I was sure of what that was.
---
Good luck selling one. There's now 10+ on my server because everyone is trying to unload them for 500+ gold but no one is willing to buy them at that. Prices keep going down because everyone is undercutting each other, albeit one copper at a time.
---
There is a talent in the survival tree to reduce the chance that FD can be resisted. So yeah, it can be resisted by NPCs.
---
Thanks for sharing your opinion, though.

Hope you’re on an RP server this is a godsend

sorry but you make a huge mistake in your thinking.  when the current lvl 40 throng of players is hitting lvl 60 and starts over farming the end game zones that is exactly the same time as all the more casual guilds start raiding . casual guilds might not min max to the fullest, but they still will use the common consumables in huge numbers, so the demand for that will soar as well!
---
yes modeled after, not a model of. There is a VERY big difference when talking about legality
---
You wouldn’t happen to be a lvl 35 rogue ganking a poor innocent night elf Druid in STVietnam would ya?
---
I just picked up a level 55 quest in the troll starting area.
---
You met a bad man over a video game and decided to share your traumatic experience instead of just not giving a shit and moving on... why are people such wussies? It’s like every day on this sub people write a novel about how someone was mean to them.
---
The biggest problem is that as warrior you look into a guide and know: "Aha, I need strength, agi, hit, crit... stamina if there is some on the gear will do too".
---
As a shaman without knowing much about your class you WILL roll on everything, because you dont know any better. This makes hunters and shamans dangerous in dungeons, because the shaman may roll on shield and 1handers, beacuse flametongue leveling but also will roll on the phat 2hander, because he does not want to be defenseles.
---
 Rolls on cloth robes for int against the casters, rolls for a dagger against a rogue, rolls for leather shoulders against a druid, rolls for a 2hander against a warrior.
---
Now every group member is pissed off and likely will not invite a DPS shaman again.
---
Interesting. I had a friend call me “Poopy stinky doodoo head” for using rock biter and he swore up and down that I should be using flametongue. Can you link me the stats so I can rub it in his face?
---
Pretty sure thats the classic experience.

Ok, one thing can stop me

Honestly just about anywhere, maraudon gph just isn’t particularly good on classic. You can ask literally anyone who’s actually done it on classic and theyll tell you it’s just not very good. Even selling the rings it’s just not a good gold farm even compared to just walking around mining thorium. Maybe you’re confused because of how good it was on pservers but I can tell you Mara farming is dead on classic except to fresh 60s who don’t realize how bad it is yet.
---
Honestly I never found the water totem quest to be all that bad. I took it as a chance to get all the necessary flight points for later levels.
---
Alts might fuzz the numbers. I was surprised to see a friend of mine seemingly running like 6 characters, and even ~4 isn't that unusual among the people I've seen. He seems to have at least two level 30 characters and probably at least 3 or 4 in the 20s. But it's really noticeable paying attention to who logs in at least once a day vs those every couple of days or only on weekends. I'd say the majority are nowhere near the highest levels but it is possible the LFGs are skewing towards the vocal minority doing a lot of BRD runs and stuff.

I just afk and as I walk past my computer just press some buttons at random. Move around a little. But then I’m also not afk’ing for large intervals of time. Just when I gotta do something a little longer than expected.

Similarly, I hate warlocks who spam Hellfire and then life tap. 
---
I constantly explain to them that they’re slowing the run down if it means I’m OOM after every pull and need to drink a full mana bar. 
---
Like I get it, you do a lot of damage with Hellfire. You know what’s cooler though? When I don’t have to spam heal you and chug water, especially if I don’t have mage water. I legitimately lost gold on my ST run last night because I had crappy rolls, had to repair after a few deaths, and drank 1g44s worth of vendor water.
---
I know it's just a game, but god damn this shit is gross.
---
Yes there will be, because Tanks and Healers will get to run the dungeons loads more times than that DPS. You queue up as a healer or tank, you'll find groups all night left and right. Hell I'll be in the middle of a deungeon on my warrior and have people whispering me begging me to tank their dungeon after I'm done and I don't even know the people. Be kind to the DPS who needs DPS gear and are on their probable only run for the day for that gear.
---
So yeah, if you queued as a role, you get -priority- on gear of that role. If no one else needs it, or if the other person doesnt mind rolling off then its up for grabs.
---
No idea man.  But its reaaaaally pushing my buttons right now.  I'm heavily considering transferring servers.  Questing is absolute hell right now, even in a group.
---
It really doesn't drop from every mob, like at all.  It takes bag space, which is at a premium lower levels.  It costs money.  Bottom line.  Stop being mad I ganked your pet.
---
We'll at least you weren't mean.
---
To get to SM you’re going through Horde territory, ending just outside a major city- you should probably expect wpvp there lmao. I’m not going to to to Elwynn and then complain about how many times the Alliance ganked me
---
You want to periodically log out and in. Make a macro with /camp in-game and have your keyboard macro press that keybind and then press enter 30 seconds later too.
---
If you play on a PvP server, go ele.
---
Doesn't work, spirit rez always puts you back to the graveyard you initially spawned at
---
Turn off the "auto remove afk".. set a "/AFK I don't want to run your dungeon" and move your whispers to a new chat window. 
---
Problem solved
---
I don't understand
---
I might be doing something wrong but setting the rank doesn't work for me. do you have any suggestions?
---
Acid
---
Hunter here.  I usually don't aimed shot until the mob is like half dead and I still rip aggro every time.  I know it's because you can't focus threat on the skull because everyone is aoe'ing, just don't blame me.
---
I mean that rogue has special talents that only add improved crit chance to yellow attacks.
---
This is how we did it in Vanilla. We spammed Trade in cities, General chat of the zone we were in or as a last ditch effort, whispered warriors or priests to tank/heal.
---
It's easy to just say "no thanks". 
---
I'd rather get a whisper to say "wanna tank SM?" versus "Hey wanna join my guild? I'm inviting half the server!"
---
Looks like he's been sent to The Grid. Say hi to Tron for me if you meet him.
---
Rape is funny right?
---
I always assess the situation with an ocular pat down.
---
Night Elves get their mounts in Darnassus and warlocks can't get theirs there.
---
And even if you could would you really mount up for the first time in Dustwallow Marsh?
---
Blame me too. I fucking love mind controlling people off the boat. I'll take the ganks if I get to keep mind controlling y'all off boats.
---
I'm on Bloodsail Buccaneers and honestly you have to know where to look for RP. My server has a discord with server wide get togethers. Last Sunday we had a storytelling event at Thunderbluff with well more than 40 players at the benches around the fire and 1 dude telling a story. 
---
This Sunday the guild I am apart of is hosting an early Darkmoon Faire event at rachet for everyone on the server, and I get to play as a the Witchdoctor for that event. 
---
And that's probably the other thing, since most people are still trying to level most of the RP will be in guilds it seems.
---
*faps in warrior*
---
What does this mean?
---
Same! Getting that first 310 mount was amazing. Later having all of your mounts upgraded to 310 because they were normalizing mount speed across the board and you already had a 310 mount... Priceless. Literally.
---
Then ignore them? I dunno how to help you big guy.
---
You can use this macro and just loot the enemy twice.
---
Yeah I was like "Oh STV is too full of gankers to progress, I'll go quest in Arathi where I won't get killed by skulls as often!" Yeah that was a grave misconception
---
Ret Aura = Thorn
---
Consecration = Swipe only up to 3 Targets. More target faster outputs.
---
Loot matters when leveling in classic because the leveling journey is THE content in classic. What your saying is essentially telling people in retail to not care about mythic raid end game gear.
---
The leveling experience matters in Classic. Average people will take month(s) to Max out their toons. So yes, there will be loot drama around  dungeon blues because it matters. 
---
Feel free to rush to max level if that's your playstyle. But majority of players in classic aren't doing that.
---
Personally I wouldn't even bother dinging at 10.
---
What, are you implying that commits can have a message that is different from "changed stuff"? Damn, I should tell the rest of my team about that obscure feature.
---
^(I agree though)
---
You're an asshole for not even reading my post or responding even single part of it, and instead reframing the argument so you can "win".
---
You act like you are this unselfish person when it's the exact opposite...you support selfish people who are completely okay with dragging 39 people down to a lower level so they can get "their way"
---
really? I am skeptical of this.
---
It's mostly the fact that they keep doing it because it works, and it annoys me because it's always the ones mindlessly looking for: "Cath aoe spellcleave", and whispering every mage on the server
---
Joined an Uldaman group to heal.
---
They asked me to tank instead once I arrived at the dungeon.
---
I was actually prot spec because I was fucking around and bored with ret.
---
Had consecrate and blessing of sanctuary, but no holy shield.
---
Salvation on all of them.
---
Couldn't hold threat for shit unless they waited until the second consecrate drop to spell cleave.
---
No spellpower on gear at this level.
---
Drink after every pull.
---
It can work if dps allows threat generation, but everyone wants to play classic like its fucking retail yolofest.
---
At 51 with Holy Shield for bosses it will be slightly better.
---
Pallys can probably tank some 5 mans at 60 but chasing tank gear to do it well makes zero sense.
---
Are the attack speeds of pets not normalized in classic? I'm pretty sure they were normalized in patch 1.12
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, but here's an upvote.
---
Slow 2h rock biter is considered to be more efficient then wf. (In PvP use WF instead)
---
Around 2.1sec 1h weapons use WF
---
Fast 1h like dagger use FT
---
Cries in rogue
---
is this a pacific or eastern realm?
---
I don't attack alliance about 90% of the time, but sometimes the urge to 1 shot a drinking clothie with an ambush crit is just too enticing. I like seeing those big #'s. I am level 42 and if I see a drinking 24 mage, it takes a lot to not ambush. I move on with my life, though. I don't corpse camp.
---
This is fabulous.  I will start adding this randomly to all my new development projects at work.
---
Just say „no thank you“ 
---
Its not hard to be kind
---
*China has joined the conversation
---
Google Elv UI or Tuk UI.. download the Tuk UI client, and install from the client to the classic wow addons folder
---
I think it's important to note that it's tied into other design philosophies
---
In vanilla "empty" space is more accurately described as "unreserved" space while Retail is so uptight about everything that nothing makes it in unless the starched shirts can be assured that it's absolutely crucial to every last player and can't be axed to save money.
---
Very little of vanilla's space is actually completely empty and devoid of purpose, it's more that not everything is purposeful to everyone.
---
In retail, if there's a clearing then you can be 100% certain that it'll contain an unskippable questline that you need to do on all your alts where adorkable sidekick Priss Crat needs you to cuddle 10 fawns to stop the ancient void lord servant Hiddle Tomston from  breaking free from his prison cube.
---
But in vanilla the mobs there exist to provide exp to everyone, they might give rep when killed, they might drop cooking mats, cloth, first aid mats, and maybe they drop a random ass white material used in one specific leatherworking recipe that one faction gets from a random ass quest in the middle of nowhere, or maybe even a random ass consumable that anyone can farm but it's only used in one class quest----OR *whatever*, they exist and it's fine if you personally don't need them right this moment.
---
Sounds like she had (300/300 fishing by the way)
---
Questmobs
---
Eh, my guild has over 700 players so it's nonstop inane chatter. It's nice when I want to run a dungeon, but 95% of the time I have gchat turned off.
---
Ah ok I saw tuk UI but I didn’t know they were the same thing. Thanks!
---
Why did you roll on a pvp server then? 
---
Not saying you’re not cut out for it.  Just genuinely don’t get it.
---
getting downvoted because people didn’t get edgemasters
---
And again hes got 5x the income so he can easily afford those repairs, he can trade amongst his boxes on the fly with no need to mail items and then wait a hr for it to arrive like I do on my alts. 
---
Basically hes got 5 people working for him and hes pocketing all their money, meanwhile you come into group - and you are a scrub, getting 1/6th his income -   
---
Hes paying 15 dollars a month x 6 not to play those other 5 accounts, but use them as a quick way to 60, or a quick access to bag space/bank space.   
---
The person is paying 15 dollars a month x 6 to get a 1 over the person paying just 15 dollars.
---
Yep everyone gets funneled into a few zones so everything becomes camped and so now you not only get a shit drop rate but you only get to kill a few mobs per respawn which causes quests start to drag like crazy.
---
Do you even possess any literary skills heathen?
---
Your word; ha!
---
I prefer the retail raid mechanics and i hope we get more difficult raids in classic. The issue is class uniqueness and sense of community in retail.
---
Classic feels more vast because it's also far more empty. Since the Cata rework, every zone in retail has to have "stuff" in every direction. Not saying there's anything wrong with that, but it definitely gives the world a different vibe.
---
Yep, BiS for perhaps another 7months.
---
If being born is neither good nor bad for an individual, then *no* event in said individual’s life can ever be considered good, because being born is an obvious prerequisite. In order words, a harmless event prerequisite to other good events must be good. Just a thought.
---
No
---
I'm just a druid. /lick
---
[There are 8 beasts that have an attack speed of 1.2](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/attackspeed.php#attackspeed_1.2) ... wouldn't one those be better than the tiger, or is there another factor I'm unaware of?
---
Curseforge has most of those addons
---
Its because you play gnome warrior
---
That's totally fair. I did run into a situation like that before - he was a good healer, he just kept healing my life taps (usually followed by an "Oops, sorry"). We just put a target icon on my character and he knew not to heal me.
---
I agree that life tapping can be confusing at times for the healer, and I'll keep a few mana pots on hand for just such an occasion. But I've gotta use it at times, and I do my best to convey that to the group.
---
That's cuz no warrior actually keeps aoe threat but more damage is more threat so aoe skills with more damage is better than aoe skills with less damage.
---
Except not everyone wants to run the dungeon multiple times. Some tank/healer classes may want to run a dungeon to finish some quests, upgrade their damage gear and go back to questing. Most people dont enjoy chain running dungeons.
---
I see you also like to live dangerously...
---
I bought it, was 90g so I snatched it. The helm and gloves are the Shadoweave set. Highly suggest crafting them.
---
Tried this, it works but i have to click twice, im looking for something that can do both on one click!
---
Bloodvine is bis for a long ass time though
---
You don't get useful ranks of prot abilities until level 50 and level 60.
---
You also need a very good +spell damage weapon to make consecrate worth a shit, and you won't have one of those until post 60 either.
---
I'm level 43 leveling as prot on a PVP server.
---
It's more fun than ret imo but anyone can walk up and gank me after I've pulled and there isn't shit I can do about it.
---
You also have to decide whether you want holy shield or consecrate pre level 51 (holy shield is much better imo due to mitigation and mana efficiency).
---
I'm just going to start automatically downvoting anyone that can't find the "print screen" button.
---
I had no idea I could fear a Druid in form. This should help a ton ty!
---
I don’t know what to tell you man if you want to be delusional and make no gold then enjoy yourself. I was one of the first locks and first epic mounts on my server, I’m just not stupid enough to keep farming Mara when it’s clearly an inferior choice.
---
Anxiety isn't a rational thought process. Trying to find the logic behind it is just misunderstanding what anxiety is.
---
I was using chrome remote desktop to put in random key strikes to prevent queues but Blizzard was still able to detect it even though it was me pressing the keys. I didn't get banned or anything but I was always hit with a disconnect after 40 or so minutes of this. I think they can tell when there's an extremely small amount of activity that they flag and they hit you with a disconnect after a while to combat people doing things like this.
---
It doesn’t come out until phase 4 though....
---
PMing individuals for your last dungeon slot is how the community is BUILT in Classic.
---
Found a healer with a polite pm this way three nights ago. Now I’m his goto tank and he’s my goto healer.
---
Go make friends!
---
OP needs to learn how &lt;DND&gt; works!
---
I had no idea I could fear a Druid in form this should help a ton ty
---
&gt; I enjoy the slow grind and the punishing difficulty that makes leveling feel epic.
---
Yes! I forgot how much of an ordeal it is just to clear through a low level CAVE! Once you get to the end to finish your quest, you still have to get out! So rewarding to do these low level quests again.
---
The true hero
---
Get the drink off your god damn laptop PLEASE.
---
I have a shirt made by Shirt.
---
gawd those with two flurry axes on an orc shaman.
---
You shouldn't be healing locks unless they are pulling aggro, and they shouldn't be pulling aggro.
---
They did get much better about this in recent expacs. To some degree in Legion and much more so in BfA - each zone has multiple different storylines going on and you can do some without doing others. 
---
Ie. in Drustvar there is the main intro quest, but then it kinda forks off into three separate chains. You can do them in any order, skip one, or skip them all and go elsewhere. With the three zones to level in, all of which scale, you can pick and choose what actually interests you within a zone. You can also come back to the zone to do one of the story threads after going up to say Stormsong for a level or two. Add in dungeons, and you have a ton of choices on how to get your 10 new levels.
---
Say what you will about BfA endgame content, but I think Kul'Tiras and Zandalar are some of the best leveling experiences the game has offered since WotLK, and I think Bliz has officially fixed the problem they introduced with Cata leveling. It's entirely different than Classic of course, but not necessarily in a bad way.
---
Considering the amount of countries that have had huge problems with identity change and theft... nope. Also moving continent is fine without even changing identity.
---
What's a Georgio tho?
---
where did you quest? tanaris has every mob dead with spawns camped, just cant quest
---
C.M.O.T. Dibbler right there
---
On an air, huh? Didn’t know wow was such a potatoe.
---
Great read! You should start a blog with these.
---
Is this someone trying to bully you into price fixing or creating a cartel?  If someone has an issue with undercutting, I always say "if it's such a low price, maybe you should buy it."
---
what level are you and where?   I remember endless ganking in the 40s while grindings.
---
I played vanilla too man, and I'm not so sure of when it was added now.  The patch notes I cited mention a previously existing SW AH.
---
People are arguing semantics. There are different types of issues. There can be syntax or type errors, then there are logic errors, and then there are design flaws. 
---
All of them can be considered "bugs" and they all result in unintended behavior, the difference is one is a single unintended fuckup(syntax/type errors), one is due to an individual fuckup (having the proper intent, but not getting the logic right), and one is an organizational fuckup (bad intent, flawed system designs).    
---
It's a matter of at what level did the fuckup happen.
---
Yea agree with that was just saying that ultimately tailoring and engineering is best for lock imo for pvp and pve.
---
HOW CAN SHE SLAP?
---
&gt; If you get aggro, run towards the tank or at least in that general direction.  
---
Yes please, even a some of meele players fail do understand this. As soon as they get aggro, they jump backwards and try to kite the mob, running away from me. But this is extremely contra-productive, you are only moving the mob away from me, out of range of my threat-abilities or even taunt leading to you getting even more damage.
---
Just stay put or move to the tank, trust that the tank and healer are knowing that you are getting damage and that if possible they will take care of you. Running around like a headless chicken only makes everything worse.
---
Eh? Why would I not be allowed to revel in good memories of the game through this subreddit and the re-release of wow? Am I not allowed to be a fan anymore? Whats wrong with you? I feel like you just felt offended because we don't think the same way and that's something I'd consider something else dude. You didn't even contribute a thing to the conversation. You're just being offended, by a (bunch) comment(s) on a sub of a game you like.
---
You can level fishing in Orgrimmar very easily
---
Need a lesson vs hunters also
---
MCP and powershifting are the only way you can even get on a chart. For a druid that's the bare minimum that you need, not a way to get on top.
---
Always respect the 1v1
---
Can yo please provide some detail to how you did this? I cannot find my sound folder and even if I did what would I do then? Thanks.
---
BIGGLESWORTH REPRESENT
---
Dear tanks in any situation: dude hold aggro wtf
---
I remember a priest named Keanex from Archimonde (horde) back in TBC days.
---
I'd go over and beat em up.
---
If you were to be killed and were in ghost form when the boat changed continents what happens? Do you auto rez or do you have to wait for your corpse to come back around?  What if you're not in ghost form yet?
---
yea, running out of quests and running out of viable quests are a bit different, sure.
---
Used to live there, it's insanely cringy and scary how they actively worship their military people. Even some dude who did fuck all is treated as if he ended WW2.
---
And if you mention that they're not even doing a good thing by going into other countries and fucking them up for corporate US interests, oh boy... You're treated like you just said you like faeces on your pizza.
---
Azeroth will never cheat on you homie! Watch out for that Blizzard though....  they might!
---
I beat the queues by playing on a medium population server.  Does it make any difference when they're adjusting how many people you see via layering?
---
Go to bed man
---
Technically the icon itself goes back further to w3 days. Crazy to think you have had so much exposure to his world, yet never seen or heard of Him.
---
Come to Rattlegore! Got a guild waiting for you. 👌🏻
---
This is why i rushed i to the 50s, its going to be a nightmare trying to quest when a random 60 walks by kills you and theres nothing you can do about it.
---
Flametongue is fine for leveling dungeons (when you don't yet have windfury weapon), or if you're leveling with a pal who's supposed to be taking the threat. It's not a min/maxer's dream, but it's better to have some damage than none when you're meleeing and are concerned about threat.
---
They're not the same but from the same devs I think. Or at least the same website
---
Yeah :D
---
I thought this was rather satisfying!! AWESOME!
---
HHM came out in TBC I believe. 
---
His mount was always the first flying horse... which is what made it super special at the time...
---
you can pvp however much you want but if you are drastically higher level 10+ and are just camping for hours in low level areas, (not working on professions, helping friends etc) then that is kind of bad taste
---
You can sell gold to Blizzard? You can definitely sell to Chinese spammers
---
This was really good, I like your ideas
---
Layering is done in phase 2 right? So I don’t think it’s anything to worry too much about
---
 As a total noob, lvl 25 priest, when should I drink? 
---
Cause it sounds like I’ve been doing it wrong
---
Sometimes, but then I just shift forms and realize I can play any class as my main.
---
Kinda harsh, I'd be OK with him sharting in his next meeting at work.
---
Good catch! Sorry!
---
Tell some your friends to boost you on hunter.
---
As a lock this can be rough too. I always wait til I see a sunder to DoT something, and always in mark order, but when the tank has to tab to deal with another mob that lost aggro I have no way to stop the dots from ticking.
---
Next up:
---
Goiborc WTS [Searing Blade]
---
Nope, I know the locations and I was playing at a time of night where no one else was around.
---
eccept at 14% you will never have anything akin to flurry. If you do the math its roughly a 10% damage increase on the boss by moving to DW fury. People who say parry haste will kill a tank are just lazy/bad at math.
---
Monet... Your dad is in a band with John Mayer!?!
---
This is why I’m not in alliance. For the Horde. Always.
---
You can't act like that same problem is not 100% present in Classic. Maybe not as much within a zone because Classic zones are homogeneous - they look roughly the same and have the same palette in all subsections. But between zones is just as bad as Retail, if not worse.
---
Look how quickly the Barrens becomes Ashenvale. It's comical.
---
This was help me in common I believe. Very common to see back then
---
It can be a problem. I had a hunter who had a ravager axe and wanted to need on the helmet from SM armory. Already also won the shoulders. the warrior was so baffled by this. Hunter just said "I want it because it looks really cool" they ended up not rolling on it but only after all of us ragged on him.
---
Negative, i'm on Kurinnaxx
---
sry, im a bit drunk, but if i understand correctly - with all those messages you are trying to tell, that in solo Holy is +- similar (if not better) than shadow? but also it scale heal up,which is also usefull for heals in dungeos parties?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dit-z1O0Qw
---
You mean (g)ank people?
---
It's only frowned on by someone who is leveling, or wants to seem like they have empathy at that moment.  Everyone else ends up killing/helping kill *someone* at some point.
---
Shadowmeld became so fricking nice when they changed it to basically be a vanish. Made nelf druid so op. Shadowmeld + flight form, cya
---
Is it really a good deed if you have to tell everyone about it?
---
Lol ok there M. Bison.
---
Nice part about rushing to 60 is once you hit it you can chill out.  Do a few things here and there, play other games, and not really worry much until actual PvP stuff comes out.
---
I mean tailoring is good to level up to 300 for robe of the void if you’re willing to drop the gold for it. But after that it’s completely useless till zg. I definitely wouldn’t recommend casual players get it until zg though as it’s a lot of gold for only a slight upgrade over robe of winter night.
---
Yo that was me, who's this?
---
I was asked multiple times today to heal various endgame raids. I had already cleared MC and Ony and didn’t have time for UBRS but it’s still cool to know people think I’m a good healer
---
/r/justbootthings x /r/classicwow
---
Incendius or however you spell it. Highly populated but not Herod high and no massive streamer population.
---
I mean, broken tooth is significantly faster than the average pet... 1.0 attack speed is absolutely insane, and for PvP it is very noticeable for pushback against all enemy casters. 
---
Min/Max Pro tip: for leveling and PvP: spec your broken tooth entirely into +Frost Resistance and +Shadow resistance to hilarious effect. That enemy mage will be furious when your broken tooth resists frost nova.. (or psychic scream) 
---
Broken tooth is so good that if you encounter him and don’t tame him on the spot you will forever be cursed to never get your BWL Xbow
---
Well they should say something then instead of just ignoring. I've done that on both sides where I'm almost done and grp up anyway but I say Ill be headed out shortly. And other times where I'm done but helping anyway just because
---
Sodality of the Constant?
---
Unless you are alliance. 
---
Then run from the 1v1 until it is a 1v4.
---
Aside from the living root that is actually expected.  Shaman can't wear mail until 40 and rings are VERY rare that early. 
---
I saw a warrior wearing the shoulders (CLOTH) from the murloc boss too.  A priest or warlock was probably pissed but also who cares?  At the end of the day the warrior was using those shoulders at 19 because he had nothing better to wear.
---
&gt; If you do the math its roughly a 10% damage increase on the boss by moving to DW fury.
---
Where is this math coming from? Since we're going to be looking at math, I would like to see it.
---
I do actually. Ive only done SFK, RFC and WC and i have yet to need on something. I automatically ignore the item. Its just how i feel about items as a whole. Ive gotten much better items from quests and random world drops. Also i do loot chests on the world just dont care about rolling for them in a dungeon. I find it hard tk understand why anyone would downvote my comment where i clearly express myself as how i feel about this topic withour shoving my opinion as either right or wrong. I guess reddit just likes disliking.
---
Oh my god, you're totally right.
---
Largergnome would have been better
---
Sounds like you’ve been killed a time or two by this “exploit”..
---
31 Warlock. Don’t have hat
---
Same, he's so much more handsome!
---
Same here. I was taught coding with fairly strict guidelines, including never putting comments as « needing comments means your code is shit ».
---
Just don't say it? Lol
---
Miles behind rogues and warriors. Not worth a spot for its damage. If you don't have a guild that's fine with giving you a spot and carrying your weight and/or you want to be a worthful addition, your only choice as enhancement is "totem twisting".
---
Since Windfury stays on your party members weapons for 10 seconds after leaving its area of effect or disappearing, you can buff your party with both Windfury and Grace/Tranquil at the same time for several seconds. Then you need to do the rotation again.
---
There are guides how to do that effectively and addons/macros to help with it. Totem twisting is kinda mana intensive, so itemization might require more int/mp5. Also, look up Nightfall and try to pull all strings to get it as soon as you can.
---
All that might lend you a spot. Might. Depends on the guild. But in the end, switching to resto is way easier.
---
I started at 59, but it may be available before that
---
2h should only be used to sweeping strikes whirlwind to start. 2h tanking the whole time is retarded and just slows the group down unless you out level the instance
---
The 5sec rule cannot be stressed enough, and it's easy to tell a great healer from an ok one by what and when they cast. On my first return to Uldaman I had a Druid healer, and I knew things weren't going to go well when he was basically just spamming Regrowth :( Final boss he used *his* Innervate, *my* Innervate, and still went oom.
---
I didn’t say I would let anyone die. Nowhere did I say that now did I? I’m a good tank, I will die before anyone else does you can trust me. Now other tanks? Can’t speak for them.
---
Nice I though that addon was removed from classic. Thanks!
---
You won't be able to. Swapping a weapon is its own action, and will require its own button press. You can't cast wf on something that's not equipped, so you will need to *buttonpress* twice (I recommend you bind this). You'll get used to that.
---
Alliance are 🗑 , come to horde and fear not we fight every alliance on sight
---
ZG isn't out yet, but this is my plan. Bats are great for PvP due to being obnoxiously huge and flappy.
---
I have been wondering about this.
---
There have been multiple instances of me windfury critting priests and their shield soaking up all the damage and me left wondering how the hell did the shield just absorb like 2.3K damage.
---
Thats even more pathetic. But I guess modern problems require modern solutions lol
---
WTB Screenshot to post on Reddit, the cringier the better— paying my dignity, it’s all I have left
---
There is a difference. Horde go about their business and will join a fight if they see a fellow horde getting attacked. Once the ally scum is in monochrome mode, they part ways and go about their business. 
---
If alliance are picking fights with horde, they are roaming in small groups together 9 times out of 10.
---
I only announce a ding on milestones, like 20, 30, 40 etc
---
&gt; Every hub was full of people, Stranglethorn quest were impossible to do, I spent most of my time flying between zones for the better part of the day.
---
Fuck, this nails it. With all the people running around, even the mediocre pace of grinding SM/RFD is 3 times faster than questing in STV. The questing experience is absolutely awful right now
---
Humor is the best cat. Only black lion model in the game.
---
When you already have max mana for each next pull, you don’t need much mana. Only enough to cast your one rotation (I will agree it’s poop for dungeons). And if mobs aren’t hurting you much (or at all), it’s not like you need the stamina. Since you can normally get about double the +shadow than you can get from +spell dmg on a lot of pieces of equal level (except dreamweave pieces, holy hell they hold their value), it about evens it out with scaling.
---
Yeah, I figured that was a ret pally aura but wasn’t sure. With that though, holy would definitely pull ahead by a solid amount. No doubt.
---
Luckily I have BW but I legitimately die in about 5 attacks. I'm 52 at 2400hp and hes 51 with 2500hp out of form. 
---
Normally it starts with him opening up on me from stealth while I'm attacking something. I feint death and send my pet on him, giving my put Intimidation(stun) while I try to wing clip and make some space. But I die before I can even get another move off.
---
I don't see how anyone thinks it would be fair or permissible to stand in a city where guards can't reach you and shoot people, when the intent of those guards CLEARLY is to kill anyone who tries to PvP in that area. You'd have to be pretty ignorant or stupid to overlook that.
---
No dots or pets in OW so no lock.
---
Only roll on things for your role in that dungeon, if you’re tanking as a pally id say “I need this for offspec” or something like that... I’d be pissed to lose a roll to a Druid on a leather dps item as hunter, especially if they’re tanking or healing
---
nah, evil is when you launch people off block rock mountain.
---
Why not press need and take it?  I would ninja that in a heartbeat.
---
Priest here, if I’m not in combat, I’m drinking.  I’m going into the sitting position as the last tank swing is hitting.  
---
PW:S shield is so clutch for many reasons, obviously be conscious of aggro, but it’s saved my groups so many times.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Yeah it's maybe not the most efficient method of levelling to jump between 3 zones (or even Darkshore/Ashenvale too). It can depend on the class too. Hunter, (and Warlock?) for example can skip stuff simply because having a Pet can make some quests so much easier when they start to change colour. And of course multiple DM count for a lot.
---
"ClassicLFG" is what I use... still requires interaction and pm'ing people to join... just gets rid of some clutter.
---
Acording to a blue post from 2005 it is so agree or not, its not different now thsn it was in vanilla. So i doubt they fired this GM for enforcing a rule blizzard made themselves 14 years ago
---
same thing happened to me, only a mage rolled on a 2h sword
---
If someone "accedentally" pulls something, i assume they can tank or solo it.  
---
Im fine with going fast, but the group and more importantly the healer needs to be able to keep the group alive
---
&gt; It’s from a medical processing facility, sold by a medical dispensary, in a medically legal state. 
---
Ok but that doesn't mean shit. These companies are trying to maximize margins on these things and as shown on the news are willing to use questionable ingredients in them. Regulations are moving so fast, and none of these vaper pens/cart ingredients have been tested for a long enough time to determine them safe. I play wow with my dealer and he moves a lot of product, he's big into health and is a strong advocate against them.
---
Those chat messages though!
---
Guess it's time to reroll.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
C'thun gloves are better by the sheer amount of stats. Also at that time you generate so much rage that you are mostly using HS/Cleave to push glancing/misses off the MH swing.
---
M E T A
---
Again - I've seen the horde do the same thing. The population of both factions isn't a monolith. Then again, I can understand how both sides could only see the other in the worst possible light.
---
Why not do the calculation for Heal? AFAIK from my MC runs is all you need with a decent bit of +healing is a rank 3 heal and you'll put most people well out of the danger zone
---
I used to absolutely love this series, holy shit.
---
This is the clingiest shit I've ever seen in my life.
---
If I were to play retail, I would have absolutely no desire to spend hours traveling through irrelevant areas when the content is completely over and done with.  Current content should not have access to flying (this was an issue in several expansions), but the previous few have handled it well, where flying is locked until the zones have been well-experienced.
---
Can’t exactly assume people will interrupt drink to continue. Sometimes your limited on supplies and have to make every sip count full
---
WoW Classic doesn’t cheat on you &lt;3
---
Yes, it makes stance dancing a lot harder, shield is for trash and any fight where healers cant keep up(depends on their and your gear levels) you need your weapon change macro ready if you want to do it.
---
I wear edge-master hand guards every time i get into debates online
---
I've tried relentlessly to trap after feign death, but it doesnt ever light up, not even in duels. Also, the animation to STOP running (that split second animation) will put FD on cooldown instantly without any effects activating.
---
Doesnt bother me at all and as a druid i enjoy it a lot
---
It's the WoW equivalent of DotA 2's MEEP MERP
---
What chat addon are you using?
---
What the hell are the odds lol
---
it does unless you get on a zepplin or boat and spirit rez on another continent.
---
I switched at 42 and did NOT enjoy it at all. However much of the issue was that I was using my accumulated int gear (which was mostly cloth). Once I got mostly mail gear it became way more enjoyable. If you can get yourself a few pieces of +nature gear you're gonna be blasting mobs to shreds. While all the drinking sucks it's still way more enjoyable than watching slow 2h auto-attacks chipping off 10% of the mobs health.
---
The point with more flurry = more hits is further amplified by the fact that more hits = more windfury procs, which is basically what an enhancement shaman is fishing for 100% of the time
---
Kutafanos
---
Then don't heal locks unless we're actually in shit. If I'm not at full mana, I'm not at full health. Period. I regen life faster than I do mana. I'd rather tap and bandage every now and again than have a healer waste all his mana keeping my health at 100%.
---
I'd totally buy one at only 500g at the moment. Will go up to 1200g real quick. On my server devilsaur is around 250g already. By just getting these, you save on not having to grab devilsaur making them effectively only 250g.
---
Choobie?
---
Yes. So many people post about it every day..
---
This. I am a rogue, I have evasion, vanish, stuns, gouge. I'll be fine and can easily get myself out of trouble, I even bring bandages and food. Don't worry about me.
---
i'm doing the prep/hemo + improve sprint build myself - having 4 opportunities to break roots/slows makes all those frost mages real nervous.
---
Would you mind sharing your talent spec? I'm currently a 36 rogue and considering changing over to hemo.
---
If you buy untested shit, you’re gonna vape shit. I don’t buy shit. Sorry you do not have access to medical grade cartridges. Learn about actual, legitimate medical industries.
---
I mean who ever got work done remotely anyways amirite? Does your work have a competent IT team? If that’s their laptop and they are not aware of how much time you play WoW on it, well— wow
---
Easily done with TellMeWhen (from memory):
---
Type: missing buff/debuff -&gt; Track minerals.
---
Condition: Unit attributes -&gt; tracking -&gt; Find minerals -&gt; yes/no: no
---
But that's when I can tame a pet and I'm excited about that :(
---
Stats on the dagger?
---
There's generally about 100-200 players online in my guild as well, 700+ is the total number. And I don't think there's streamers on my server, but possibly. It's usually Medium pop when I sign on, sometimes High.
---
Moonkin is worst caster spec to level.
---
Ele is actually manageable pre 40, damage just gets shifted to lightning bolt/shocks rather than fury procs.
---
"Why do i feel like everyone there mains hunter"
---
Why everyone have to hate on hunter?  As if there arent idiots on every class.
---
Yeah, Dickens. That’s what I said.
---
It’s scummy, but you should almost expect it. It’s a BOE. People get dumb for them.
---
Yeah. If the lock is life tapping let him stay on low health until you have mana to spare.
---
You'd probably be better off farming other stuff.
---
Everyone rolls need on epic BoE items.
---
Most people all roll need on an epic BoE since people usually sell them.
---
War is hell
---
This has been against the rules since classic....... And very well known.
---
When you are one of the first on the server, it’s a cornucopia. You have access to a relatively untapped market of high level items. That is related the market volatility, you were just capitalizing on a sellers market. It’s not consistent any longer, and probably wasn’t even while you neared your epic mount (unless you blazed ahead and most others were incredibly slow). But as of now, with more people having access to the items you had fairly free reign on, the prices have dropped significantly.
---
You can’t compare the money you made then, that’s just ignorant.
---
Go back to bfa, please.
---
His GPU will recover in about 15 minutes when the DMT wears off.
---
That's funny. I didn't realize that. I did know he was being MC'd. Probably executing out of habit, ha. Would have been funnier if I killed him.
---
There was blue posts about this issue in 2005 stating the exact same thing.
---
Are you saying they should have changed their rules from vanilla?
---
So I'm bad because I want as close to BiS as possible even while leveling?  Why even gear at all when my guild can just carry me.
---
To prevent people from dying and running to a GY far away to skip mobs in the world.
---
This was the rule in Vanilla, too.
---
Meh, dungeons could also be done with 4 Warriors and a Priest. I’ll bring you pure DPS to avoid loot competition..
---
Have fun with that “your lucky we bring you” mentality in raiding, its gonna be swell.
---
That's pretty true. I  was even looking up and browsing discussions what I should play as an alt to pair with my mage main ,still see it even today that hunters are suggested for people that are indecisive or new due to fast easy leveling, good solo and sorta fun.
---
What does the rule have to do with what I said? XD I been using a fishing bot since vanilla because fishing is boring a. F.
---
One of the few games where I can say the same. Something else didn't pull me away from overwatch. Awful hero design alongside questionable at best map design made me dip out.
---
It is and I know people who got suspended before that area was changed in cataclysm.
---
Sulfuras is mostly alliance, but that just means more bodies to stack ;)
---
How much is that typically worth
---
Thanks, King! 
---
Will get on that
---
If I wasn’t a poor af in between student your have more than just my sympathy sir.
---
&gt;Even if the healer wasn't drinking, it's the tanks responsibility to watch that shit
---
As a healer it's your job to play like you're grouped with a bunch of children. We've known for over a decade that tanks and dps can and will do some next level stupid shit and try to blame you. 
---
Every stop between pulls should be "Ok what is this mouthbreather going to do now" and plan accordingly.
---
If 100 is the average, then there must be a fair few people with an IQ of 85. The sad truth...
---
&gt;  What am I supposed to do in a level 10 zone as a lvl 60 character?
---
Level professions, buy items only those vendors sell,  help a mate, run through the zone to get to another zone
---

---
&gt; Part of the fun/nostalgia people get from classic is the journey from 1-60. So many different scenarios play out for people and it’s the world building aspect that I think people love the most.
---
You're probably gonna get downvoted for this one but I totally agree with you.  At BEST, "the journey" being a new and exciting thing each time is a highly subjective thing and not for everyone.  At worst, it's just flat out wrong.  There are barely enough quests in the entire game to actually level up off of.  So it's not like you pick and choose where you go and what you do - you simply do it all, every time.  
---
And yeah I wouldn't be bringing up dungeon spamming with groups of dungeon grinders in support of that argument at all.  People are spamming dungeons in Classic right now way harder than I've ever seen it on retail.
---
it was a grindwall before searing gouge was implemented as quest hub. you do badlands -&gt; feralas -&gt; tanaris and at 45-48 searing to get the curve to 50-51. at least thats how i did it.
---
You would be winning the lottery for that to happen.
---
My bosses response was "Well, I'm sure you can make do"  
---
Basically I work for logistics and they're the assistant-administrator of data processing (he outranks my boss).
---
DansGame NO CHANGES
---
You legitimately have no clue what you’re talking about and I hope you don’t convince other people to buy into your delusions.
---
i think i'd be a bad tank after playing so many cloth and/or mana classes. I'd just constantly be waiting for my mages, priests, and paladins to get full mana before every pull and make the dungeon take 50% longer than necessary
---
I don't want any spellcleave, is it OK if I do this?
---
Good to see the self-assured arrogance of classic posters never changed. This is lame, but it's always been against the rules. Whether it should be or not is probably the only discussion point that I still see.
---
Ditto
---
Fairbanks is a good one

Hi, /u/JeansBeansTv

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d72tah/first_time_playing_wow_in_a_long_time_and_i_must/). 
---
Which is why you start pvp in booty bay, and get chased by the guards into the water.  People think “free kill!” And jump in after you as you have to keep going to get out of guard range.  
---
But then you polymorph them, and they sink.  And then you frost nova.  And then you polymorph.  And they sink, and then drown.
---
&gt; Look how quickly the Barrens becomes Ashenvale. It's comical
---
The barrens and ashenvale are two different zones, and take literally 25+ minutes to run from one end of to the other.
---
Because when honor comes out and then there's a reason to do world pvp - honor = loot. Right now there is no reason, other than "fun". But this "fun" is only because you're enjoying ruining that person's experience
---
Too late I saved the name #smallerdwarf
---
As if you can't easily dps/heal while looting with autoloot.
---
Alliance got the babies
---
Oh alright makes sense then. I just know higher leathers are still selling well for me at least but I forgot you’ll get only heavy around those levels.
---
In classic, it truly is 'back in time', as in early times where you had to walk everywhere, craft everything by hand, go out and kill for a living and stop and actually look at the scenery like OP did.
---
You've discovered a portal to the 90s Rave Flyer Dimension.
---
He was skinning
---
Yes, exactly! Though I think we should let the group know these things ahead of time so they don't panic and/or think that we're terrible. If the tank loses threat on some mob that's already half dead, I'll just handle it myself. No need to go balls to the wall trying to heal me.
---
Chance on proc doesn’t affect feral attacks since you hit with your “paws”, right?
---
All good things are classic only
---
Is it against the rules to avoid trash mobs in dungeons now too?   
---
Really?
---
Are you asking if you can proc the stun in like tiger form?
---
Hyperbolia is a fundamental attribute of a strawman... Nevermind.
---
It just depends what you're doing with it is all, on fairly constant or consistent colour or image you'll likely be fine, the issue arises with the screen going from darker to brighter. So like if it went from super dark to having a white flash explosion thing going on it can shock your eyes and "potentially" do damage, not likely but it "can" happen. It's the reason why the disclaimer about it was usually before a cartoon or something that jumps between bright and dark at a fairly regular rate so it can stress the shit out of your eyes compared to if the rest of your environment is fairly bright so your eyes don't perceive the difference quite as hard. It's basically just something that was said to cover their ass on the rare chance that it actually did cause a problem
---
Fuck you, fuck EVERYBODY!
---
Fuck this shit, I‘m outta here.
---
Here, tell these people something they don’t know about me.
---
Not looking for sympathy! But I get what you mean my man, but yeah, being poor sucks. I can relate! I hope your studies will bring you a bright future. And if you're in a super tight spot in the future, send me a DM. It never hurts to ask, you know?
---
Lol I'm going back to hillsbrad to one shot low levels and you can't do anything about it.
---
I saw it on the AH on Mankrik last night, was a pricy little bugger
---
I can’t get weak auras to work. It won’t register in my addons list. Can you post a link of a working download?
---
Yea
---
Whatever with your drop, the paladin in your guild is clearly delirious and should be admitted.
---
Then dont fkin use it in a situation where it can fuck things up, how about that?
---
not an exploit there are a few areas in BB that don't have guards.  If you cant kill him ask alliance members to go kill him
---
I've never PvPd in this manner and have been victim of it. Still don't think there should be rules to arbitrarily enforce what is fundamentally a programming and design problem. Players shouldn't be punished for developers faults, developers should fix the game to function as intended.
---
I really appreciate the write up.  I'll try the Omen of Clarity way.
---
Meanwhile, there is a rogue off skinning mobs, while everyone else is fighting.
---
I said I was going to roll a mage this time cuz I was a hunter for classic... got to level 21 with all my friends, gaming and rl, on same server, all round same level. .....aaaand... I rerolled to my hunter! 
---
Feel a bit salty when they are now all getting into their 30s and I'm just now back to level 21 but... I know it will be worth it in the end and I'm having far more fun and enjoying myself...
---
there was a guy named balenciaga making bags on Yojamba hahaha
---
I remember getting this as a hunter from greed rolls back in the day. I would purposely walk around with it just to tilt people.
---
You're right, you are a dick of the worst kind. Can't wait till it happens to you!
---
The guide /u/Rahotah_of_the_Horde linked is solid.
---
Agility gives you crit and dodge, but you need some strength in there as well or your hits are only going to tickle.
---
Weapons for us are 100% stat sticks when in a form. Procs don't matter, the DPS figure doesn't matter, the swing speed doesn't matter. Only look at the stats! You didn't state your level, but once you hit the 20s keep an eye out on the AH for a [Slaghammer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1976/slaghammer) as it's a solid choice for Bears. I only *just* replaced mine, at Lv44, with [this baby](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9408/ironshod-bludgeon) from Ironaya in Uldaman. [Blanchard's Stout](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13046/blanchards-stout) continues to elude me :(
---
When trying to build initial AoE threat, Demo Roar will do more for you than Swipe because it hits everyone. Swipe is basically just a rage dump for when you have too much.
---
cuz i aint a rat
---
Uh, nah. I've healed in MMOs for near two decades and I'd sooner leave the group. I never have been, am not, and never will be a babysitter.
---
People wanna pull and wipe and be stupid when it's not a good time? Fine. I'll stick it out. People want to complain about me after I've told them I need to regen mana?
---
See ya.
---
around 140g
---
I use the same method
---
Explain why the guards won't attack her, but if I retaliate in any way, while standing in the same spot, guards are on me in an instant, and don't even look at her. Something is being abused.
---
All men must die.
---
"enjoy" retail, lol.
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Yeah, I give leeway for that because there is an attempt. It's drastic, but there is a change. The walk between Samophlange and Ashenvale, for instance, gets greener. Not ideal, but from a 2004 game, understandable.
---
But, you also have bears mingling with worgen. Centars mingling with hyenas. Etc. You don't have this 100 yard circle is where you kill turtles. This 100 yard circle is where you kill lizard people. Etc.
---
Dragging 39 people down?  Seriously?
---
Oh no, you might down the boss two seconds slower because you chose to value fun over being an elitist douchebag.  The horror!
---
If you are filling the last couple spots in a raid and one class is better than another, by all means go with the optimal class.
---
But the way you talk about it suggests you'd kick someone from a full raid because you found a better replacement.  Or you'd just straight up refuse to invite certain specs when when starting with an empty group.  Those are things an asshole would do.
---
You know what's actually dragging 39 people down?  When some elitist douchebag is screeching in chat about the DPS being half a percent lower than you want it to be.  I will gladly take a suboptimal build who is fun to play with over a morale killer.
---
so this is where it gets a little tricky. so when i dps i use a mix of LB ranks and when clearcasting procs i use CL. Also use Flame Shock as go to ES rank 1to interrupt and rank 1 Frost Shock to slow mobs that run away.  if aoe i will use fire nova totem and if single target searing. Your other totems depend on who you are running with. Mara is kinda bad to fight as ele because she is immune to nature so you just use flame shock searing totem and off heal. You can run ench/resto and heal but you have to carry int gear. honestly just depends on how you want to play. Sadly you have to drink quite a bit when you dungeon run. If you can get away with using some spells and then mana regen go for it.
---
if it was the GPU, why would it render his character just fine, instead of everything being messed up?
---
Sounds like you've had terrible luck. The couple of times I've been camped or a ?? was running around a zone ganking everyone I put a call to my guild or general chat and someone usually jumps on the chance to come check it out and see if they can help. Sometimes you just have to leave and come back for those quests later. If you don't want PvP at all it's certainly a pain but that's what PvP servers are.
---
Also you can save the name of any ?? ganker then find him for payback when you're 60.
---
You have a point
---
Sounds like you're describing Shazzrah eu? If so fuck the horde
---
It is known.
---
What did the teacher say?
---
I am lvl 26 FYI
---
But I guess its more of an addition than a change if you think about it, "new" content
---
Faceless man?
---
People like this make me want to switch to horde, both in BFA and Classic I try and help any of my comrades if I see them in a fight. But I rarely see other alliance folks helping out when I’m getting beat up by some orcs.
---
Fucking dagger ear....
---
gotcha. Still isn't as meaningful as if, for example, there were high level resources in starting zones, and if mobs posed a challenge and gave exp... sounds like vertical progression, which wow doesn't have sadly.
---
Watch yourself you can get banned for this I’m pretty sure
---
Mind sharing which add on you’re using for the quest objectives? :)
---
Okay mister man that has zero concept of supply/demand and how he capitalized on it when it was in his favor.
---
&gt;I think that particularly with WoW, a large part of the issue was that the game itself was developed before modern day models and best practices were around.
---
Ehhhh, that's kind of like buying a new graphics card or processor. By the time you buy/do the thing it's basically not the most modern thing. WoW wasn't made in the dark ages of programming. It's recent enough no one thought software was a fad or anything. They would've programmed with *some* level of extensibility in mind. For better or worse, classic also hasn't been iterated on for the past decade and a half. It doesn't have all the changes piled on top of it that modern wow does. At least, from my understanding it's actually form the old code base.
---
But that whole thing is part of what makes it so fascinating to me. You see strange bugs, and you do a CoE and look at how you got there. Learning from the weird bugs is a big part of what informs modern standards. You see something break, fix it the best you can, and say "how can we prevent this from happening again? What could we have done better then? What can we do now to try not to make this fix create issues going forward?"
---
And, as you mention, that is balanced in part by restrictions about how many resources you can put into it right now. You're not going to rewrite the engine to fix some bug. So the balancing act between doing the perfect fix and the fix you can actually do in the real world is often an interesting discussion/process as well.
---
And I really like getting to see all that for big projects, particularly when it's not *me* that's banging my head against the wall cursing whoever wrote this code so filled with spaghetti it could get a Michelin star.
---
Can you see why catering to that type of audience is bad for the long term health of the game tho
---
WeakAuras
---
How else do I name my character Reeéeehrowth?
---
"Art"
---
Do sunken temple?
---
Swords are going to be top dmg and there are a ton of quests that reward blue swords while you level. Swords = easier and better dmg. Swords become really strong once you 5/5 sword specialization in combat. 
---
BUT if you want to use daggers go for it. You will do just fine.
---
Go to retail is so whack I just imagine a giant smelly man child playing on the other side when I see a horde spam that
---
But it will have felt like an eternity
---
Fair, I didn't read what he was actually receiving.
---
I was on Gorefiend. Had a NE rogue with same name as here on reddit.
---
Crusader
---
Can't say I feel bad for him.
---
Well, you misspelled the word “you’re”, so I don’t think you know what you’re doing.
---
What does that have to do with it though?
---
I’m talking about the 10 seconds it takes to run from completely dry savanah to lush green rainforest. 
---
The guy was complaining about sudden and sharp borders between areas. I’m saying the border between Ashenvale and Barrens is literally just a line where one environment just stops and becomes a totally different one. There is no transition or gradient or intermediate area. Full on Ashenvale forest and complete Barrens Savannah are just yards apart
---
If it does actually proc in your forms, keep in mind the chance is like 1/200.
---
Procs don't work in forms as long as I know
---
i thought you were accusing khotta of misrepresenting the other guy
---
One of my first things working for Blizzard was teleporting people off the roof of Darkshire and into the guards. It's been 12 years haha.
---
I’m literally a business major, you just make assumptions about things you don’t understand and are too afraid to admit when you were wrong.
---
But it made u mad tho
---
This only counts unique active characters picked up by /who while the add-on is running. So accounts are definitely counted multiple times, but your full 10 characters probably aren't being counted. Maybe 3 you're bouncing between however.
---
There's probably nowhere near 6 million *active unique accounts*, but no one here can really know.
---
Coming for raiding Vanilla and TBC, rest shamans are indispensable to raids. While an enhancement shaman will never out-DPS a rogue, it can dramatically boost other melee dps. I faintly recall dropping one into the tank party too.
---
Was this on Grobbulus? Today there was a rogue there ganking for &gt;6 hours.
---
What the fuck would holy pallies even wear if they could only roll on plate? Strength gear?
---
Well played
---
It’s his RPPVP server and we’re all living in it
---
All fantastic add-ons, if I might say.  Though a long time ago I replaced xperl with Pitbull because it has a more minimalist feel and I don't really need all the bells and whistles xperl offers.
---
If you are in a dungeon and can't afford water that's your fault not anyone elses.
---
Now that's just a "feature" 🤣
---
Seriously, get Spy Classic. It's exactly that but ingame and it notifies you when they are close.
---
I didn’t even think about this and wasn’t even thinking about HoJ as an item to pick up as a feral.
---
I never said I’m keeping the warlock topped, but I’m also not going to let them sit on 20% HP in case they do end up pulling aggro. 
---
The point is that you’re insanely more likely to put yourself into shit by using Hellfire compared to Rain of Fire. AoEing from a safe distance at least gives the healer a chance to react if you do pull aggro. And more often than not if the warlock using hellfire does pull aggro, they freak out and run around like crazy which just makes it even harder for the tank to pick it back up. 
---
In ideal situations, yeah hellfire is fine. But it seems like every warlock I’ve grouped with is more concerned about topping DPS meters than succeeding in the dungeon.
---
ah yes,
---
pally and the priest
---
HURRAY! Time to go back to my hunter and finish leveling it
---
I mean the crazy people are in every group.  There’s people that are middle aged, sometimes younger, that try to get senior discounts and then flip out when you don’t give it to them.  
---
Playing a national anthem at sporting events isn’t super out of the ordinary, although pledging allegiance to the flag always was kind of weird to me even growing up.  The people who accused the football players of hating the military because they knelt during the anthem are just idiots who blow that whistle at everyone anytime they can.
---
I probably emailed them then.
---
Its in the eyes
---
Hutzbutz...more like BustzGutz...
---
How do you fall off the flight path? 
---
Can you jump off the mount?!?? If so please share as it’s not done the conventional way, I’ve tried...
---
I feel like every guild recruiter is a used car salesman
---
DUDE the tips totally worked and I just killed him 2 times in a row. It's been like 5 minutes and he seems to be leaving me alone now.
---
What does autoloot do, how does it speed stuff up?

---
As a lock with a lot of instants, I feel it's my duty to combat loot.
---
Typical Alliance scrum leaving out shamans on your list of classes
---
But it's not broken and you could have just said "Skull of Impending Doom works like it has for 15 years and will break CC". But gotta get that youtube channel spam in I guess.
---
Raiding "blind" would only be possible without public or semi-public testing. That's where all initial knowledge comes from.
---
I never really thought about it like that.  I wouldn’t mind a TBC classic but after that I’m not sure. Classic+ is an awesome idea.
---
I love being a healer sometimes. I get to decide who lives and who dies.
---
That patch was a very sad time for all shamans. It is commonly referred to as The Time of Low Spirits by all shamans worldwide.
---
Doesn’t the healer generate threat on all mobs?
---
Maybe not quite as bad, but the first classic guild I was in, an officer kicked a guy because the officer was in Westfall and saw the guy doing a quest. The officer told him to join him to do the quest, but the guy was already in a group with some other people. So the officer kicked him because he didn't immediately abandon his party and group with the officer. For a quest. In Westfall.
---
To the amusement of all, the GM caught wind of it, logged on, kicked the officer and invited the guy back.
---
But did you get a hat?
---
&gt; I've seen that option in retail quartz to "hide samwise icon"
---
What disrespecting addon would even offer that option :p
---
This is how religions are made
---
Careful, the classic purists will hang you.
---
Sorry, dungeon pace is set by the healer. Most healers I know are fine to pull plenty of mobs between drinking, but when they say “OOM”, stop. If you don’t they’ll sit there and watch you die.
---
Taking a 30 second break every 10 minutes is not a big deal.
---
Sure you do bud. You arent fooling anyone with your misused cognitive bias reference and your post history entirely consisting of super smash bros posts. You probably deliver mail. no need to be insecure about it. Mail delivery is important
---
I got you covered my man if we can find a way to send it my new bank is currently not linked to my paypal. Add me on discord we will figure something out Hathrow#2437
---
To store useless things.
---
I was in a hardcore guild once legit one of the worst experiences in the game...
---
Active raiding was nice but 4 to 6 months into it I was so over the formalities of saying hi back, gg gn gm gratz ex.... And within a week it was brought up on an officer meeting that I wasn't contributing enough to guild chat and that it was the first strike, the second one I will be out. the minute I heard that shit I just gquit told them to go fuck themselves imagine taking the game that seriously lmao never again.
---
Don't talk about crushes in a thread about dual wield tanking lol. You would absolutely have attacked that idea a week ago because you're a follower not a leader. And even worse you attack change because you see it as a threat to your prestige as a follower.
---
You just have to right click the body and it gets all the loot for you, no additional clicks, and then closes the loot window.
---
But as someone said they were skinning apparently not just looting. So still have to take the full duration of the skinning action.
---
Whoosh
---
To put that in perspective...that's 8, 24 hour days.  and then 18 more hours after that.
---
cause his twitter account got closed you dipshit
---
Don't feel bad, you look for friends. They look for a good tank.
---
And equal damage reduction
---
I built a general rogue guide website:
---
[https://felstriker.com](https://felstriker.com)
---
Would appreciate feedback, particularly on talents. Thanks.
---
I want to try DMT but I don’t want to accidentally shit myself or something.
---
You want proof?
---
Mana might be an issue but yes
---
Crits refund their mana and Int gives crit
---
I love that server
---
Horde or Alliance, there are assholes on both sides. Don’t think one is any better than the other. When I was Ally, I’d get ganked by a group of 3+ higher level Horde, and when I was Horde, the same thing would happen from Alliance.
---
You literally cannot hold aggro on more than a few mobs at once from AoE damage. That's why the "spellcleave" groups will often not even use a tank, but you're still useful at rounding up the group to start with.
---
Unfortunately most ranged seem to think this is just how it's supposed to be in every dungeon, and run themselves OOM or dead while hopelessly fucking up the aggro.
---
Your best bet for normal pulls is to mark a target that you are going to completely ignore, preferably a caster, and get them to actually kill it first. That way by the time they get to the hard hitting melee mobs you'll have had a chance to hit them first.
---
had to put these in my bank
---
When I play healers, I just say “OOM” and sit down to drink. You keep pulling I hope you don’t need a heal for those mobs cause you aren’t getting one.
---
BT doesnt do any more damage. Pet damage was equalized in a earlier patch it's just better for pvp.
---
Private servers are super fucked on numbers.
---
As a priest I can confirm this is a feature, not a bug.
---
Tip for healers: if something is on you and a mage frost novas it MOVE THE FUCK AWAY. Dont stand there in melee range letting it hit you.
---
Is focus a ui option in classic? Or is it an add on?
---
But then shit really hits the fan and suddenly the pally has the power to make you run a marathon.
---
Mine is names SweetDee because she looks like a bird.
---
Yeah some people are weird. My guild has 8 60's. 3 of which went into a half pug MC as horde on alliance dominated server. 
---
Idk if they cleared it but nobody was talking about clearing. They said running. I know they downed at least 4 bosses though. 
---
Are they hardcore for having spent more time on private servers then retail the last 10 years? I wouldn't say so. Their time commitment is more efficient than most players.
---
Damn if only there was a rating system to like and dislike comments
---
but who would you be without us?  
---
The hunter is nothing without the hunt.
---
80 energy is more than fine. Possibly less with Imp Gouge and clever watching of energy ticks.
---
It's actually not a dps increase at all as damage was equalized between pets in an earlier patch.
---
Danger Will Robinson!  Danger!
---
Hahaha, I mean that's pretty unfortunate but man the image of this playing out in my head is priceless. Bonus points if you're an innocent looking Tauren.
---
Nah, Metzen is whose responsible for that, but Samwise is responsible for WoW looking the way it has since about MoP or WoD.
---
Their artstyles are very similar but Metzen's is coarser and tends to be heavier inked with darker colors while Samwise's is extremely smooth and tends to be lightly inked with bright vibrant colors.
---
Also Metzen's art looks like it belongs on the cover of Heavy Metal Magazine while Samwise's art is [just on heavy metal album covers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYBseL_YPAs)
---
You forgot to add:
---
I managed to get agro from either doing a big heal too early or tank not doing any kind of agro on all mobs
---
It’s been so long since I’ve seen that face.... I forgot he existed.
---
That's for sure why they can't just blanket ban people for doing that, but come on.. probably obvious for most people that that is *not* what's happening.
---
You should be an alright tank. Problem is there are also impatient and uncooperative DPS sometimes who demand you keep agro under the the most demanding situations.
---
I’d advise just ignoring them and tank and pull at your own reasonable pace.
---
1) there’s various types of business majors, so that doesn’t mean always mean much. A civil engineer doesn’t know all a chemical engineer does.
---
2) You *should* still understand how you capitalized when it was a sellers market and the impact the introduction of competition has on prices.
---
*CAN* you make more farming things like Thorium? Absolutely. Will it always be the more reliable and consistent? Absolutely not. This especially hold true now, and as time goes on since markets haven’t fully stabilized.
---
Gotta life the irony of a healer in WoW named Esuna.
---
All of that is fine in your books?
---
Moonberry Juice is 80 silver a stack before Honored discount.
---
If a tank is constantly only letting me get 1-2 regen ticks before I need to stand up and heal him even after I've asked him to stop, **I will let him die**.
---
When was something on the ground... ever good?
---
You're such a good listener.
---
That bubble doesn’t absorb? Does it just block all damage?
---
Not all of it, but the early parts.
---
Wowhead has over a decade of user added information. Can’t beat that
---
Awesome. Now what the fuck does it say.
---
Me (Babythrall) was kicked from the guild for saying how wrong this was.. LOL this is classic it should be fun and fair.. not this military BS shouting over everyone stealing loot.
---
Tanks seem to have the most responsibility so therefore they get the most privilege.  Had a tank win HoJ both times ive seen it dropped.  Couldnt really be mad since we only were able to get there cause of them.
---
The problem is that you are maybe one out of every five or ten rogues who are just going crazy with dps, with no backup plans. And if we let you die, we get shit on for it.
---
I agree in an optimal group you're totally right, but when I'm running pugs I'm gonna heal everyone, because more often than not it's a player who doesn't know how to control the damage they do, not someone like you who knows what they're doing.
---
I literally couldnt care less. One of my best friends is a biomed engineer that still doesnt understand how to use his "there"s correctly. Your shitty engineering job doesnt make you smart just because you work with robots. The fact that you thought so says all I need to know about you. seeya
---
The pattern I've come up with is fairly complex.  Blizzard is likely only looking at a pattern of 1 to 4 repeated movements.  So if, (and this is a big IF), if blizzard has some kind of detection mechanism looking for pattern movement, I doubt it will find a pattern as long as mine.
---
Blizzard is lazy.  It's more likely that they depend on reports, and after receiving enough of them, then they go back and look at any patterns to confirm the reports.
---
I have no worries....
---
No wonder I could barely do damage to priests 4 levels below me as a Warrior...
---
Not that I would beat them even without the bug, but.... Just saying ;-;
---
unfortunately the latest update breaks your map (it constantly resets to your current position)
---
I guess no holidays will be their new hashtag as weird as it sounds haha
---
I do this to...like when I have to go fix, and/or, eat dinner with the family....
---
I think it's called "safespotting" on common tongue. And it's usually abused in Silithus at the QHub, Booty Bay at those sharks and Gadgetzan on that big cage. Prolly WAY more places (I know the boats have them as well) but those are the super known ones I can think of at the top of my head.
---
And I still think it's banable, can't imagine they have changed THAT much of their ToS since vanilla, gameplay banable wise.
