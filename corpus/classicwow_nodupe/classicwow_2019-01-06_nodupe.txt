Have you seen r/wow? They hate BfA, they hate the devs, they hate activision. If you filter out the memes and art you're left with a string of "Here's another part of BfA that sucks/is broken" and "Here's why I'm unsubbed"

[removed]
---
it's a bare minimum. more exceptions could be made depending on what spec you are leveling as aswel but eh
---
Exactly. Even the highest population servers start to wilt and die once AQ40 has been out for a few months and killed a lot of PVE guilds. This OP is retarded in many ways. 
---
Right, because *this* "loot trading bad, is change an ninja" thread is new and fresh from the other twice-daily ones for the past week...
---
I was thinking about going something like this for a leveling and PVP https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bE0MshboZbhtcZEMbz 
---
  
---
I'd be a troll for shadowguard blackouts. What do you think?    
---
I tried it on a instant 60 server but didn't feel too great. Can you help explain the pros/cons
---
Basically you're forced to go to the new/reset server unless you like playing private PTRs because that's what the server you're on ends up being.  
---
The honor system shouldn't be changed. There's a reason that people do think somewhat fondly of it (except the extreme R14s, that is).
---

---
The only thing I would agree on CHANGING is to add that aforementioned deserter-debuff for people dodging a queue. That would pretty much solve the issue in itself.
---
So? They stated their reasons for it, and it makes sense from a business perspective. CRZ on the other hand does not. 
---
It better than that barrel lid off Rag. 
---
Polite lion.
---
My eyes are opened! We need to apply this philosophy!
---
No more unlearning professions - decisions are final. Remove the vendor buyback. Respeccing must be impossible. Fail a quest &amp; it's gone for good.  
---
Everything must go, because at the end of the day, we need more punishment.
---
Ah, artifact..so it's a Legion thingy? 
---
Fair enough. The question is whether buffs to feral could have an impact on the meta of PvP. You point out that the FC druid build doesn't even spec feral much at all - but if feral were to be buffed, might we expect feral builds to become more common (and thus impact the meta)? 
---
For the purposes of this question, we're assuming that we should not make changes to classes that would affect PvP. As I said in my first paragraph, I think this assumption is a bit silly in the first place, considering there were huge meta swings within Vanilla itself (see example comparing Enhance vs Fury pre 1.4 vs 1.12). But even given this assumption, it still is not a reason to avoid buffs to enhance or ret. If we shouldn't expect FC druids to run feral (or for teams to otherwise start bringing feral druids) by buffing feral, then it seems like it we shouldn't be worried about feral buffs either. In that case, the only "troubling" spec to buff (insofar as we're worried about PvP) impact would be elemental shaman. 
---
Completely rework pvp and add pet battles pls
---
Comparing Europe to Americas:
---
- Europe is more likely to roll PvP (73.1% to 68.2%)
---
- Both regions will roll Horde at about the same rate (47.6% for Europe, and 48.7% for Americas)
---
- Europe is more likely to roll a female character (30.4% to 24.0%)
---
-Europe is less likely to have an active sub (23.2% to 30.5%), and more likely to have played on private servers (75.7% to 68.3%)
---
- Europe generally expects to level to 60 faster than America.
---
I’d say in general, Europeans expect to be more “hardcore” than Americans for Classic.
---
Your too dense to argue with. We don’t care about business sense ok. That’s the reason the current game is a pile of garbage. We don’t need to ruin classic too because of business shills like you but given that Blizzard is in charge we expect it. 
---
Even that is made easier because content will be cleared and overgeared faster. Well it depends on the release schedule. MC will be stomped through so fast everyone will have it on farm once BWL comes out. This means we'll overgear the place and smash through those bosses really fast. Thus we overgear AQ when it comes out and so on. This is what happens on private servers where nearly the whole guild is BiS geared, even the mid-tier guilds. The only solution is a faster release schedule which some people probably won't like.
---
I mean its shear mass would likely kill someone.
---
Bludgeoning weapons are extremely effective against unarmoured or armoured foes.
---
Plus its got a good stabbing point, though with all the notches in the weapon's blade i'd argue it would likely get stuck quite often which is bad.
---
Though the skulls might affect enemy morale thus causing them to consider fleeing which is good.
---
However, it glows which means no hiding and surprising the enemy for you.
---
But it does guard your hand with at least a semi-effective looking hilt.
---
Pommel doesn't look effective for clocking someone with though.
---
Which is how it was in classic wow :) 
---
Look, you are a logical person. Just out of curiosity I read your last post and I'm assume from the way you phrased things you value logical decisions over emotion.
---
The idea that players will abuse loot trading just because they can is the emotional argument. 
---
Yes, it will be possible to be an asshole and use the system improperly, but it won't be a serious problem. It's already a common rule on private servers that if you win an item with a need roll, you equip it. Mainly this started with BoEs, so people didn't fake roll need and then sell the item, but the same general rule makes it easy to detect loot trader ninjas as well. If you sell or trade the item you won, you can't very well equip it so you are detected as a ninja the first time you try that BS. It'll happen occasionally, just like the way mages roll on plate occasionally, but those players will get blacklisted and removed from groups and over time the community will police itself.
---
If you don't believe me, just wait 250 days. When Vanilla has been up for a few months and server communities start to stabilize you will see.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
Yeah, It's a pain in the butt to get though. Much easier to cheese the other colors. You can get the holy hidden appearance from mobs on Argus and unlocking the variant colors for holy will unlock the color variants for this as well. Red is 200 world quests after getting the hidden appearance for example.
---
You can solo ww axe cyclonian at level 30 you just need at least 200 engineer, for the compat harvest reaper an mech dragonling &gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4q69fW47oM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4q69fW47oM)  
---
Thing is if you are ally, its a waste of time, keep dual wielding till 34 where you can get the bonebiter overpower procs give you a easier time leveling
---
Why would you need Legion addons to work then?
---
Warrior. I'm a DPS at heart but have already done the whole mage and rogue thing. I don't want to heal, play a hybrid class or a pet class so that leaves the one choice. I also like having the option to tank. 
---
Specifically a male troll warrior. Undead females are my favourite character model but because I'm primarily interested in raiding, their racials are useless. So why a troll over an orc? The models look cooler. Their racial is useful in long boss fights. But also, I don't want to shoehorn myself into having to use an axe. Sure, an orc can use any other weapon just as well as a troll but then I'd always have this feeling in the back of my mind that I should be using an axe.
---
 
---
One other reason, which I'm not too sure is an issue, is less competition for weapon loot. I won't be allowed axes but no minmaxer will be going for swords/polearms/maces.  
---
I think they might have been added in the AQ patch, 1.9. 
---
It's going to be just as toxic as retail currently is. Remember in Wrath when you had to use an external website in order to ping your gearscore from the database? Yeah, we're going to be doing that again. You won't be allowed to go to MC for the first time until you've cleared MC and have the hammer and it can be linked in chat.
---
That's why flex raiding is sick, but hard mode ruins it anyway. Having 10 and 25 just gave smaller guilds access to raids without having to condense or be consumed by other guilds. There have always been 10 man raids and 25 man raids. 
---
You're too low for Dire Maul.
---
Sorry, but we do not allow posts primarily focused on private servers on r/ClassicWoW as per the rules. Please try r/wowservers. This post has been removed.
---
Imp charge and charge levels are maybe not necessary, but leveling speed picks up a bit at charge rank 3(?), its when you can charge and instant MS/BT with a 2h. 
---
Leveling one right now and with a warrior its enjoying the little things, lol. 
---
Honestly, I like top better. Original looks kinda goofy with the floating skull marker as apposed to the top with the actual skull. IMO the coloring on top looks better than the red handle with green-ish blade.
---
Aren't the pommel and guard supposed to protect the user's hand? The modern one looks like it'll wound the user. Plus the handle looks uncomfortable to grip unlike the much smoother, bambo-looking handle from the older model.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just saying, the Vanilla and TBC designers were better.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Looking forward to see which warrior tanks will enjoy prot farming to sustain 10 years of wipes in consumables and repairs!
---
I like this a bit better than modern shields. That said if Blizz offered a visually remastered version of Classic, I would take it. Since its back to 4 races, maybe armor can be adjusted for each race?
---
Keybind everything, and I do mean everything. Even amp/damp magic, as well as r1 fbolt, blizzard, Nova, and arcane explosion (all r1 and Max rank). Duel everyone. Ask why you lost. Keep your eyes open in the back of your head. Ask yourself what you would do if you got cheapshotted right when you pull that elite... Then prepare to eat a cheapshot. Duel everyone.
---
Duel everyone. Watch videos. Level engineering. 
---
The only difference between the two is one has updated textures and tassels/scrolls and the other has textures from 2005. At some point you're being picky
---
The second one speaks to you... I love it
---
Well I can't judge the other colors since I haven't seen them but fel green on dark purple looks really good. 
---
If you think about it, servers being shut down and then new servers popping up is kinda like resetting.
---
Tbh I'll go up to high res textures but not much further.  
---
Nobody knows. Maybe, but nobody knows.
---
Maybe a month prior to release. 
---
Summer release, without an extended beta period, I believe was the announcement. 
---
So I wouldn’t hold my breath. 
---
[I don't know, [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJfLvMUT7rE) [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlNAJJtCfpI&amp;t=2s) [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5elh0aaIIz0) [like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRzKUR628aU) [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6q_AMvpga0) and wish WoW was made in the present day (with classic gameplay choices ofcourse).
---
My main was on Aman’Thul. I quit playing in TBC but who knows, maybe we crossed paths once or twice. What guild did you belong to during TBC? 
---
You've got some nerve calling me dense...
---
Business logic is the reason Classic will NOT go the path of retail - because that would be less profitable for Blizzard, which is extremely obvious to see if one just stops hating for 2 seconds and thinks about it. 
---
But, as always when people run out of arguments, you'd rather come up with insults. 
---
&gt; [Good zone? No.](https://media.giphy.com/media/10bpeJe8QjAr4c/giphy.gif)
---
Anti-dodging mechanics however were not part of vanilla, so adding them would be a change. 
---
Azshara was one of my "secret" leveling areas back when the game first came out, and the only reason I was one of the few rogues to hit 60 as fast as I did. I genocidally purged the blood elf chicks out there days on end. Good times. Then the Chinese farmers showed up. 
---
I may be in the minority, but I wouldn't mind a complete graphics revamp with 100% authentic Classic gameplay. I'm bored of retail, but I like my upright orc. I'm glad they at least struck a compromise with optional updated terrain and textures.
---
Man I'm so jealous, starting in TBC I can't wait to enjoy the old world and even raids/dungeons I've never touched
---
I read an article a long time ago that basically said the same thing. I know a ton of people that do stuff like spend &gt;1 hour getting ready in the morning then bitch about never having free time :/
---
Ya but Mograine aint no bitch
---
I... was.... called....
---
Assbringer  🍑
---
Gotta get that 8x 4pc(I think it was 4pc, it was the taunt passive). for that fight only :D
---
I'm not going to say this shield isn't tight, but I can't wait to see people running around with the Red Dragonscale Protector. So iconic.

Did no one mention Howl of terror? Seriously??
---
Personally I’d rather the original models, a toggle wouldn’t kill me either, but it’s more the consistency of one model set I like. Plus, upright orcs are great, but the revamp ruined Taurens, Humans, Gnomes, and undead are eh.
---
The dream. I loved BC and WotLK. Everything after that I've been a tourist for because it mostly felt like total shit comparatively (imo obv).
---
Even in Vanilla (and definitely today) a majority of wow weapons and armor would very easily harm the user and/or restrict their ability to lift their arms or turn their head without impaling themselves.
---
Wow designers have never been good at making their gear actually work. 
---
Yup. This is where I am at too.
---
Top one looks bad ass
---
Wow that’s awesome
---
Thanks all! I greatly appreciate all of the feedback - video included. It sounds like I'll have a few options to consider as we go. I imagine we'll try everything out and see what works best. Thanks again!
---
Naw Activi$ion believes the live version of the game is a beta. That way they make money off hype alone and not the actual product itself. 
---
Yes please.
---
Ok :*
---
God... have you ever looked at the stats of the corrupted ashbringer? There are so poorly optimised. Atleast for soylliance, its like for PvP ret paladin only. QQ
---
On one side I really think the new models are beautiful, but when I remember and play classic, HD would just feel... wrong? I probably would try it for a bit if there was a full model toggle, but in the end I like the game for its "primitive" gameplay, so it would just feel weird playing it HD!
---
Ok, but what can we extrapolate about France from this?
---
This was my raiding spec in naxx to cheese several fights. I was *that* priest.
---
MC  priest for intructor raz and grand widow
---
But the greatness lies in being able to use spirit of redemption and soul stoneing over and over again on loatheb (lightwell didnt proc his debuff). All the while keeping up shadowweaving and tossing out half decent heals
---
Do you have at least three talent points in tactical mastery? Some of the stance dance can be done well enough with macros
---
/u/st0rfan has made an excellent guide. Try searching for "1.12.1 Warrior Macros" on the search engine of your choice.
---
A good start would be learning how to pop Berserker Rage *for fear immunity* and then get right back into defensive stance.
---
I personally think they will push out an alpha or something. I have said this before but the amount of bugs and glitches found by players during the short blizzcon demo were in the thousands. Blizzard have to make sure that every quest, item, ability, zones, mobs, numbers, etc etc.. is functioning and perfecting all that in \~8 months takes A LOT of man-hours on the ground.
---
They might be confident that they can do it themselves, but it wouldn't shock me if we get something like the demo again but with more zones and levels. Let's see!
---
You know what looks badass? Swords that you could actually use to fight against someone.
---
Like these two for example:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=5614/seraphs-strike#modelviewer
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=3206/cavalier-two-hander#modelviewer
---
2 crit 1 hit and a proc on a melee weapon is poorly optimized? What? If you factor in sword specialization outpacing mace spec, it's easily one of the best arms pvp weapons in the game
---
Yeah my server referred to it as VC. Im pretty sure this became the norm after dire maul came out.
---
test 
---
You make a good point. I just think the higher resolution models of today make these flaws more visible.
---
I'm sorry. But never once did I say to myself "gee. This armor looks cool but how do they not hurt themselves? This armor would kill you in real life." It's a game. I play it to escape reality.
---
Doesn't mean it isn't an amusing observation. *Shrug* 
---
Sorry i should have said in PvE terms, the boe trash drop misplaced servo arm is just better for warriors. They can pick up the crit and hit from other gear.
---
I'm my guild's shadow weaving bitch and I wish I could do this spec. Just for Holy Nova, so I can actually farm gold.
---
Currently 31/0/20 for PI.
---
Omg i used to be that spec, it was terrible. i never got loot cause nothing i did was ever worth giving gear its like MS/ OS /the one priest that debuffs the boss and doesnt scaled with healing or spell power
---
Well they both look like shit honestly but the original has the better player lore.
---
Glorious!
---
I imagine that they will. Part of me thinks that they would be really wise to do so, or at the very least use it to test sharding. Make one server with sharding and one without just to see how it goes. 
---
Make sure you duel everyone.
---
Yeah, but there are ways around it. Curse (I think) made a new strategy where you only needed 6 tanks and with the ZG trinket you don't *need* the 4-piece although it's still preferable as you will need the spell hit (yes taunt counts as a spell) from other gear which usually means cloth items.        With some rotation trickery, I'm not sure how because I was just a lowly dps, you can delegate one of the hard-hitting bosses (the dwarf I think) to only 3 tanks which means the other horsemen can be tanked by normal fury warriors or even bears. They don't even need a shield because they hit with rubber swords. This further cuts down the T3 required. 
---
Nevertheless, 4H is easily the hardest encounter in Naxx. After farming KT for months we still occasionally wipe on 4H. Also, not only is the encounter just outright very hard and punishing, having new people in the raid essentially puts it back to square one which in progression guilds can add months. Method was stuck on 4H for so long they didn't even get server first, but once they finally got them down I believe they got Sapph and KT within a week. 
---
Ugh. Bot deleted my connent. Attempt 2:
---
Yeah, but misplaced servo arm is a bad example because it's brokenly strong anyway. The swords off of kelthuzad look absolutely insane stats wise (I'd say it's fair to consider them incredibly optimized stats), but 2x MSA beats the both of them in controlled weapon tests, at least on a certain unofficial common server that shall not be named. Easily some of the best weapons on a human. 
---
In general DW outpaces 2h on alliance anyway. Slam spec can do impressive damage, but the swing on MoM kinda dwarfs this weapon for that spec in particular. That doesn't make it a ret meme weapon though.
---
Nope
---
Indeed. I spend too long on the mornings as well, it's something I'm working towards improving. 
---
Ah okay, so it seems to be basically just as I thought.  Reading my post again, I see I may have been a little confusing, trying to recall the instance ID system and figuring out the tracking on individual characters.
---
Not thunderclap? Like in dungeon?
---
No king rules forever.
---
Blizzard is dead, but it will find financial success just like Activision does. It just won't be Blizzard. It will still make hundreds of millions of dollars in the Chinese mobile market alone.
---
I couldn't care less about Activision Blizzard's direction at this point. I played every Blizzard game and am completely done with all of them now.
---
I just want to play Classic WoW. If they fuck it up, I'll continue to play on free pservers.
---
I feel like there are mushrooms involved here, but I don't think it's related to your sword 
---
Sounds way too short to process any feedback.
---
That’s what 10 years of art and design experience will do. You draw cooler swords.
---
Most mages will use detect magic tho, a lot longer range and puts warriors in combat. Still your tips is very useful.
---
I think the idea of giving Classic new content, or content based on past expansions, but keeping the "hardcore" (though I kind of hate that term) spirit of vanilla intact is intriguing.
---
Idk i view ashbring the same way as hand of rag, a really cool 2 hander that is pretty good but being a 2h in pve means that its just sorta out classed but dual weilding (again i cant speak for horde) not to mention the servo arms cam be farmed since trash respawns. There was 1 nightelf warrior we gave all of our 2 hander to cause he would go out and world pvp because no other person in the raid would use it aside from hunters that already had ashkandi
---
I hope they do one but it would not surprise me if they didn't. 
---
Yeah and the quest to unlock it is every single Vanilla WoW Ashbringer theory. Fishing, killing Oozes .etc
---
I was always hoping for an HD remaster.
---
The whole no changes movement started out being about not altering vanilla-style gameplay, then memed itself into even the slightest alteration bringing about the slippery slope fallacy. Then the meme because a legitimate platform for their movement. Which is what turned the subreddit into a shitshow.
---
"The honor system shouldn't be changed. There's a reason that people do think somewhat fondly of it (except the extreme R14s, that is)."
---
Lol. Do you really think that people have fond memories of that system?
---
What people like back then were the rank names, the reputations to grind + rewards, and the actual BGs themselves. There is no way, I say no way, a normal player with a job/life liked the honor system itself. The sense of achievement was totally overshadowed by how bad the grind was, even when talking about r10.
---
"Ok next week I'm done, progression bar almost literally full.. [...] WHAT NO PROMOTION?! DAMN THAT @#€!;? S*** Still have to keep grinding like an idiot the whole week without the possibility to do another activity because otherwise I'll lose all my progression... REEEEEE"
---
Yeah. It was that bad for many people. Plus yeah, R12+ hell.
---
Yeah, it's generally more uncommon, and admittedly that sword is outclasses by MoM (just as hatchet of sundered bone is outclassed by KT swords), but 2h is definitely  competitive on alliance as slam spec imo. The caveat is that the rotation is more difficult and good ping is more important, but you can put out big numbers. At one point the top alliance warrior on one of the servers I was playing on was a gnome rocking MoM. Dude trashed on all the humans running MSA and KT swords. In my current guild one of our top warriors is running UTB BWL patch and beating all but our best geared DW fury (who has a massive gear advantage ATM).
---
That’s because they have stealth 
---
Just because the original idea of private servers was that because it was free, that doesn’t in anyway mean that currently that’s how it is. 
---
Private servers keep getting created in order to play older versions of a game that’s no longer available. A large portion of the private server community has come forth to admit they will gladly pay for such game if available. If the private server community wasn’t about paying, this sub wouldn’t have even half the amount of following because a lot of us have played or currently do play on private servers due to them being the only available content. And that we will definitely be playing(or at least trying) blizzards classic version regardless of the fact that there’s a sub cost. 
---
Yea I do agree some people do play because it’s free and will stick to only pservers even after blizz releases theirs, but that is a very tiny population. 
---
You should probably play a MMORPG with a medieval theme that's more credible and accurate. WoW will never be that game, the gear and even the characters are quite goofy looking :) 
---
Please make more of these, they're great. So many other guides don't understand how to be succinct at all, this is a refreshing change of pace.
---
What's the problem if it caters to a very particular crowd? It doesn't have to be accessible to everyone.
---
I can play this game and take an entirely valid point to the extreme in order to make you look bad as well. 
---
Here’s 1,000,000 gold and instant level 110. 
---
Also the bosses keel over when you look at them. 
---
Flying mounts will be granted at 400 speed at level 2. 
---
What else can you cry about?
---
Wow has a lot of accurate looking weapons and armor.
---
The problem is they're all low level garbage while the end game stuff looks like it used some kid's drawings as concept art.
---

Undead have cannibalize though, so slightly easierb levels till cap, and very rarely can help in dungeons/ raid where your bandi is on CD and you have a few seconds to eat adds corpse. I know it's a tiny thing but hey...
---
Amen.
---
I have a few friends rolling together when classic launches, we're forming a guild of which I will lead. Was going to roll prot warrior because tank is really always the thing historically lacking seemingly. However there seems to be so dammed many people with the same idea. So is it worth it? 
---
&lt;3
---
Nothing like finishing up your HFP quests and having what amounts to T2 gear in every slot. Lol, or finishing T4 and still having half T3 equipped because T4 was soooooo bad at launch.
---
You could go over to Ashenvale and Stonetalon. You'll outlevel most of the quests, but you can use it to fill in some gaps in relative safety compared to STV. Hillsbrad Foothills should have a somewhat more equitable mix of Horde and Alliance players and has a bundle of quests around 32. And around 33-34 Desolace becomes a little more attractive. 
---
It isn't so much "they don't want to" it's that it costs literal millions of dollars to hire those GMs.  
---
Between 2004-2007 Blizzard went from 1 building that fit all employees, to an entirely separate customer service building (that was 2x larger than the Dev building) then splintered off more than half the customer service out of state and eventually building a 3rd location with an even larger customer service building.
---
During time this they were hiring somewhere between 20-40 GMs every 2 weeks to meet the demands of the player base.  Those GMs were fulltime employees with benefits.  From a business perspective this just won't ever happen again and as players of the game we can't expect it to.
---
Blizzard knows their customers.  They know that players need to be able to resolve loot issues from the volume of tickets they received on this and they aren't gonna pay millions of dollars to shuffle loot.
---
This is why even if it isn't ideal, it's probably best to accept loot trading will be the closest approximation to what we had back then.  The rules of loot trading check all the same boxes a GM manually had to check in order to make a valid transfer.  Giving us the ability to resolve that ourselves isn't gonna change the core game.
---
Mate, let me spell things out... 
---
Your whine is "loot trading is bad because ~mistakes should be final". My retort is "If that is true, what about these other ways blizzard shelters people from their ~mistakes?"
---
Your counterargument, "Well why not just give everyone everything automatically" has NOTHING to do with my comment. I NEVER insinuated that blizz should make the game easier. But hey, who am I to burst your bubble? No need to actually engage with an argument when you can call me a retail and cry "what about..."
---
So you’re pro or anti trump?
---
Dungeons blue in TBC weren't much better than T3. I mean you had much better talents and extra skills but the item level was roughly the same. That being said I have a very hard time believing T6 geared 70's wouldn't blow through it like paper. The DPS difference is literally &gt;10x for every class.

1. Bristlebark Gloves -  Gives u 1 more sta &amp; agi
---
2. Shoulders. - Feral Shoulder Pads Gives more armor, i saw in comments someone else saying some other cloth shoulders that give 3 sta, however this quest is a 23+. The only other shoulders u can get is Ghostly Mantle which is 31 armor and 5 int/spirit.
---
Now tbh i'm not sure if 5 spirit or 29 armor is best, guess that is situational, both can work.
---
I can't stand the upright orc model.  I really want the old models back, where my Orc looked savage, not comical and the Undead looked like a decomposed corpse, not an old man at a misfits concert.
---
Wtf server were you on? We PUG'd up to LK on mine :/
---
Those estimates are hilarious
---
Blizzdrones just trying to cope with retail dying. 
---
Yea right,tauren female looked better with that cut of a mouth with no teeth.
---
Mate let me spell things out for you...
---
&gt;Your whine is "loot trading is bad because ~mistakes should be final". My retort is "If that is true, what about these other ways blizzard shelters people from their ~mistakes?"
---
This is the only item not consistent with vanilla gameplay. How hard is it to implement a vanilla consistent fix?
---
I spelled out the vanilla context in my very first comment however you continue to want to take this out of the context of vanilla gameplay, mainly because it’s the only way you come even close to winning the argument. 
---
You also absolutely insinuated Blizzard should make the game easier by complaining about “difficulty” something which I never even presented.
---
I have engaged entirely in the argument. The problem is you used and continue to use disingenuous methods to try and prove me wrong. None of these have come close to negating my original point. 
---
You’re welcome to keep trying and losing though. 
---
The problem for you is that it’s not just that my point makes sense, it’s also that it’s entirely factual.  
---
Maybe I should start taking things to the extreme and not responding to any of the points you make, that seems to be the type of argument you are more familiar with. 
---
yeah even most of the r/wow subreddit hates bfa it seems. I saw they are now giving out +5 to professions as rewards. Ridiculous how much spoon feeding retail does. Like why not just start them off with max everything at this point.
---
The way loot trading works, if you hit need, you cannot trade the item. 
---
No issues. 
---
How does machine learning help with this lol
---
This is factually incorrect, textures are the same. Lighting is a tad different, and there’s better shadows if you so choose (which really messes with the aesthetic of some zones, Elywnn Forest for example)
---
Have you ever had banana on waffles?, or do you mean like banana bread waffles? 
---
Everyone gets this confused.
---
If you hit need, you cannot trade that item.
---
You only trade if you hit greed. 
---
Original undead male animations are nicer.
---
Spirit of redemption is just not good
---
I don't know why I bothered, but here's proof that you're wrong AND that there's a spectrum of rewards after the quest turns green, not gray. After a quest turns gray, it always grants a static 10% of the normal amount of experience.
---
[Album](https://imgur.com/a/P1Mn8BX). Forgot that paint butchers screenshots, sorry!
---
I'm using the [Shadowshard Maraudon quest](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7068) as an example because it's significantly lower level than the rest of them and I tend to barely get experience from it. You can pick up the quest at level 38, but it turns gray at 53. You get normal experience all the way to level 47, but at 48 the first penalty kicks in, ie. 7250 * 0.8 = 5800 which the screenshot demonstrates. Level 49 and onwards penalizes you exactly like the chart demonstrates.
---
It takes far longer than what you think to turn from green to gray.
---
I would too. I like the classic aesthetic, but I like the gameplay more. 
---
Another option is to bind stance swaps into your abilities, it isn't as flexible but it's certainly better than not swapping.
---
The cracked abs dry lips of the male Tauren drives me nuts, I really miss the old models 
---
Oh definitely, I very much prefer the old animations. The undead models don’t look awful post update either, same with Orcs and female trolls.
---
This is another way to do it, use a /castsequence macro so you don’t double cast berzerker stance. I do this with overpower, thunderclap, and mocking blow as examples. 
---
This makes absolutely no sense as a concept. In order to roll and not be considered a ninja, you'd have to be able to use the item in the first place. Otherwise, whoever rolls on the item to give it to their friend would obviously be ninjaing, and they'd be dealt with the same way other ninjas are dealt with. That's why this isn't a problem on retail, or in any other version of the game where you can trade loot.
---
probably because they will be ready day one?
---
If you are willing you should do it as MT needs to have almost 100% attendance and losing them really hurts. Even if there are other options for tanks locking down the MT spot is smart imo. 
---
And then in another three to WotLK and stops there
---
More power infusions! 
---
&gt; Ever since Halo 2 introduced automatic matchmaking for the first time of any game  
---
Halo 2 (2004) might have popularized automated matchmaking on consoles, and in shooters more generally, but they were inspired by Warcraft 3 (2002) by Blizzard Entertainment. Which was in turn likely took inspiration from it's strategy lineage where ELO is a long-time rating system for Chess.
---
If you doubt that's true, why would a first person developer for console be taking inspiration from a real time strategy PC developer, you have to consider that in the 1990s, prior to Halo, Bungie made Myth a series of real time strategy games for Mac. Blizzard were their competitor and likely inspiration. 
---
I kind of get what you mean.  Sometimes what's seen as shitty behavior can be subjective, but in my experience, it isn't much of the time.  When there's a clear intention to directly deride people and make them feel down, that is shitty and is not acceptable.
---
For example, this: https://i.redd.it/4fcmybga5w721.jpg (ignoring the full context, which makes this even worse) I know, people used to the internet and its harsh language would get over this fast, but not everyone has the same thick skin.  It's just plain shitty all the same because of the person's clear intention.
---
However, I'm not sure when exactly behavior crosses the line to being "toxic," to be honest.  I suppose when it's repeated, so it turns into harassment?  And I mean actual harassment.
---
I'd sooner watch the MC ones than these, don't want to ruin the surprise for content I've never seen before.
---
This video idea was spawned from the idea that at the time my guild had new people in everyweek while progressing KT. And it took to much time to re explain 14 fights trying to get then up to speed. I have no intention at this time finishing naxx despite having meaxxna and intructor razuvius videos started from back then
---
It is when your guild is cheap and doesnt want to pay for consumes required to kill loatheb and you got 5 warlocks on hand all with there soul stone is up. Not saying its optimal but in vanilla you gotta carry a few slackers this was a way me and the GM came up with to cheese the boss. We just... didnt tell the RL till the first time i died that evening
---
My Dad works at Nintendo. He told me it’s a month from now.
---
1) If you're changing your premise to #nochanges, I recognize that I can't change your opinion. But your original premise was that loot-trading is bad because it takes consequence away. I'm asking what distinguishes this consequence from the many others you're OK with leaving inconsequential.  
---
2) I never complained about difficulty. Stop projecting.  
---
3) LOL I'm asking a simple question. What is your basis on deciding what consequences are good for the game? If your answer is #nochanges, there's no need for this facade of rationality.
---
It's cool I'd be ashamed to admit that I spec'ed into Lightwell too.  
---
I dont care if this sub ends up being an ad. I dont care that I was an idiot child that didnt accomplish a thing when vanilla was out. My body and my soul is ready. 
---
lol It's literally a dishonorable way to play that nets you a lot of honor...
---
There's several times that many players on private servers and of course the number of players on some backwater illegal servers is entirely representative of the interest in a legit game that is properly marketed by one of the titans of the gaming industry. But yeah let's just say 50k and call it a day.
---
Besides that I didn't say that new servers were more likely than expansions, just that talk about "what you do in 5 years" is pointless because Blizzard won't let it go that far, either via new servers or expansions. The only thing that I will say in regards to that topic is that I'm not staying beyond BC. I've gone through the shitfest that is WotLK once and never again.
---
The Legion Ashbringer actually speaks to you as well, you can hear the voice lines [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16PuEnilaz4). It was just a really rare occurrence I think. I do think the Corrupted Ashbringer sounds much cooler though
---
I wrote A LOT about WoW back in the day and Vanilla’s honor system was the *only* part of Vanilla the devs openly stated they had to change because it turned out to be ethically irresponsible game design. 
---
I felt so in love with this game at the 2million subscribers in 2005, but it’s not equal enjoyment to the 2million in 2019 lol
---
Yeah makes sense, I do see how they'd come in handy if the situation calls for it.
---
For MC interest, I'd say that even though it's easy and people are unlikely to be held up by it, you should consider that there'll be a bunch of people who won't progress past MC and weight those two factors against one another.
---
Actually if you go to hillsbrad at lvl 38 most of the quests will be green if not grey. Id suggest going there at 30-32, doing whatever you can and coming back in couple of levels to finish up the harder quests
---
I'm just lovin your ballin green shoulder pads.
---
Well if the 10th anniversary molten core is anything to go off of... lmao i dont think everyone is well versed in proper mc...etiquette ill say.
---
Ashenvale is more of a lvl20+ zone. As a 30 most quests will be green or grey. Not really a good idea. Same with stonetalon and there arent that many quests in there to begin with so lots of running around just to kill green or grey mobs that give little or no exp. Plus bunch of horde there
---
This is an important subject. Thanks for making this man!
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/levels-38-40/
---
Looks like the hillsbrad is just 1 chain quest. That zone seems to otherwise be skipped.
---
Stonetalon will have a Horde presence, sure. I'm not saying it's the most efficient method, but if OP wants to stay safe for awhile, even leveling through grey and green quests from 30 to 32 or close to it before heading to Hillsbrad or wherever else is a viable option. 
---
It's one of my favorite zones.
---
I am kind of in the same boat. Lvl33 dwarf paladin at the moment.  
---
Heres what I did. I love redridge but because of so much horde in there I decided to skip that zone. So the natural progression of Westfall-Redridge-Duskwood didnt work this time.  
---
What I did at 20 after westfall I went and finished the easier quests in duskwood. After went to the other continent to Ashenvale, tried to do most quests there. After went back finished up Duskwood. I thought it would be enough to get me to 30 but unfortunately at about 26-27 all I had left were elite quests. So I went to wetlands just like you and came back later to finish up Duskwood.
---
This got me to 30. After that I went to hillsbrad, theres a bit of quests there you can start doing at 30. After that right next to hillsbrad is arathi highlands which is also lvl30+ zone. So its easy to juggle those zones doing yellow quests.  
---
At about 34 I plan on making a trip to Desolace and shimmering flats. Shimmering flats has a lot of grindy quests so a lot of exp is to be had, but also a lot of horde there so its better to be a higher level when you go there. After 36 might make a trip to STV but will prob get owned there.  
---
Tl dr: Hillsbrad, Arathi highlands, Desolace, Shimmering flats east of thousand needles
---
Tips?
---
You know what the real problem with queue dodging is? It's that the forums aren't really around anymore for you to call dodgers huge pussies and to challenge them. Sure there is discord and reddit, but back in the day, people would talk serious grease to the PvP'ers on the forums and ask them why they were dodging. Then of course, people would take screenshots to show people either leaving matches or after they had murdered the dodgers.
---
Community sanction is the best enforcement mechanism in vanilla wow and it should be the same in classic.
---
outbaby
---
Tbh classic transmog wouldn't bother me.
---
&gt; 1) If you're changing your premise to #nochanges, I recognize that I can't change your opinion. But your original premise was that loot-trading is bad because it takes consequence away. I'm asking what distinguishes this consequence from the many others you're OK with leaving inconsequential.
---
I’m not changing my premise, you seem to want to try and create a false dichotomy in order to try and get yourself out of a bad argument here. Now you gone from “difficulty” to “consequence”. What’s fucking wrong with using MY OWN words instead of the ones you keep trying to shove into my mouth?? Oh, I know. My original premise STILL continues to destroy your argument. 
---
&gt; 2) I never complained about difficulty. Stop projecting.
---
&gt;Everything must go, because at the end of the day, we need more punishment.
---
Right. That statement was coming from a perspective where you weren’t worried about punishment or difficulty. I believe you. 
---
&gt; 3) LOL I'm asking a simple question. What is your basis on deciding what consequences are good for the game? If your answer is #nochanges, there's no need for this facade of rationality.
---
You didn’t ask shit. You portrayed my obviously true opinion that you disagreed with in a negative light in order to try and make it look bad, I called you out on your bullshit and now you’re so upset you keep responding by moving the goalpost. 
---
Now you’re trying to put me into a corner by asking a question which isn’t even related my point. No thanks, I have no reason or commitment to answer your questions. You’re blocked, I have no desire to play games in order to provide you the consolation prize of the satisfaction of wasting my time. 
---
If you have legitimate questions you can go back and read my original point. Maybe this time you can show it the respect you have yet to give it thus far. 
---
ive always been sad that i never got to participate in the "Maws" fight in ashzara
---
i was told as a noob there was a big shark in ashzara and i went for a long ass run there and went swimming but never found anything other than the farty bubble giants then i found out its a triggered quest
---
i love that zone though
---
I agree with someones comment above that suggests blizzard would take action against queue dodgers, which if true might be better than making changes to the queue system to try and stop it.
---
I think comparing how difficult it will be to get pvp rewards in classic to what actual vanilla was is probably not going to be apples to apples. The bottom line is classic's demographic is different than the vanilla demographic. The player base will be older on average than what it was, and likely have less time to commit overall. 
---
Personally I think we're going to have higher percentages of casuals, less people paying for gold/honor farming, etc. 
---
So high pvp ranks will still take tons of time, but I dont think it will be quite as difficult as what it was
---
https://www.wowhead.com/retribution-paladin-artifact-weapon-ashbringer-guide#appearances-and-tints
---
There's Fel green, purple, red and gold.
---
Several replies later, still refusing to answer  
---
&gt;What is your basis on deciding what consequences are good for the game?
---
If that's not a legitimate question... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1DcD8e55YY
---
&gt;I wish I worked as diligently in school as I did farming reputation for it.
---
Damn. That hit home.
---
Play on RP or PVP/RP servers to ensure fewer toxic players. Those servers will 100% ban anyone being toxic (unless it's a fun kind of toxic involving roleplay).
---
Even if you don't like to RP, this is where you go to find more mature people.
---
It's more technical limitations. Look at Samwise Didier's art and then look at WC3. Clearly wasn't a drawing ability, hell the WC: Reforged models look damn near similar to Sam's original art.
---
Seriously. DM has referred to Deadmines throughout most of vanilla. But newer players will swear by calling it VC because they don't realize that in vanilla **there was no Dire Maul** until later.
---
&gt; I don't know why they feel the need to make the items look so unpractical.
---
Because that's the Warcraft aesthetic and if you think otherwise then I don't know what game you've been playing for the past 2 decades.
---
I highly doubt it. They called it a demo for a reason I think. They figure as long as they have the old data in the new engine everything will be fine and can be hotfixed later when the issue pops up. In my opinion  Blizz wants to spend as little resources as possible on this.
---
There may be some closed testing with dungeons and raids, but like I said, I seriously doubt it really. 
---
When people start blaming the jews for everything, saying the holocaust didn't happen and is a conspiracy, or just outright racist shit. That is what I consider toxic players on pservers. Lots of these people exist on pservers because there is ZERO accountability and no moderation in chat channels by the GM's.
---
I played a rogue in early vanilla. Leveling up I was a combat spec because it was so much easier finding weapon upgrades than sticking to daggers if I remember right.
---
I never got deep into pvp but I'd imagine assassination &gt; combat. Especially in group scenarios. Rogues are pretty squishy so you dont really have the time / dps to get great stun lock kills. 
---
If you drop an ambush and a quick backstab you can kill clothies before they know what hit them if they weren't at full health
---
You guys think they will go the OSRS route and inject new content under the same engine and mechanics?
---
Evidence to back up that he feels like that? That's pretty easy, he said it.
---
Notice how Vanilla had the highest margin of growth, and most *new players subscribed.  Unlike TBC, Vanilla did not come with a massive following before it, it built the foundation and massive player base for later expansions.
---
I think some of that is unecessary. The Dampen/Amplify for one. And r1 AE is not necxessary most of the time because if a rogue vanishes close to you, you should use CoC not AE. If a rogue vanishes far away, don't run around spamming AE guessing where he is, use a r1 Blizzard on top of where he vanishes instead.
---
Ashenvale - Alliance Territory

Azshara - Contested Territory
---
"State of the game" daily thread.
---
One of the top comments reads 
---
&gt;I wish I was having fun. 
---
Can't even make this up. 
---
Interesting. Okay so, that is a level 42 quest, which means that it turns grey at level 48 (42 + 6), which is why at level 48 and above the experience is scaled down. Again, according to this algorithm:
---
    Character_Level &lt;= Quest_Level +  5 : Quest_XP = (100 %) or Full_Quest_XP
---
    Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  6 : Quest_XP = ( 80 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.8 / 5) * 5
---
    Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  7 : Quest_XP = ( 60 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.6 / 5) * 5
---
    Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  8 : Quest_XP = ( 40 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.4 / 5) * 5
---
    Character_Level  = Quest_Level +  9 : Quest_XP = ( 20 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.2 / 5) * 5
---
    Character_Level &gt;= Quest_Level + 10 : Quest_XP = ( 10 %) or ROUND(Full_Quest_XP * 0.1 / 5) * 5
---
Quest_Level = 42
---
Character_Level = 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 = FULL XP = 7250
---
Character_Level = 48 = reduced to 0.8% = 5800
---
Character_Level = 49 = reduced to 0.6% = 4350
---
Character_Level = 50 = reduced to 0.4% = 2900
---
Character_Level = 51 = reduced to 0.2% = 1450
---
Character_Level = 52 = reduced to 0.1% = 725
---
I see in your screenshot that your quest log shows it green at level 52. I'm not sure why that is, since all vanilla databases out there seem to show this as a level 42 quest. So the math lines up correctly as you can see above, but why it shows green in the quest log I'm not sure. Maybe different quests turn grey at different levels?
---
According to this page under the "Colors" section: http://vanilla-wow.wikia.com/wiki/Level
---
It looks like mobs turn green to players at different levels as you get higher level. So maybe this applies for quests too. Does that quest turn from yellow to green when you hit level 50? If so that would make sense.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Is this a new copypasta? 
---
Im getting this for my transmog in classic!!!
---
... wait
---
Mage pvp is all about cooldowns. Getting the enemy to use their before you use yours. Very much like a rogue in fact. This is why a rogue vs mage duel is like a chess match.
---
You also need the usual pvp skills such as predicting your opponent (eg: having a rank 1 blizzard in mind already when you are charging a frostbolt on a frost nova'd rogue (cause he'll likely vanish at this point). This has the potential of saving you a cooldown (blink) because he will no be able to cheapshot you while out of stealth.
---
That's one example out of thousands. There are tricks that mages, even after pvping for a decade, still have no figured out. Such as using counterspell on warriors/rogues. Yes it is useful for putting a warrior in combat as he is heading your way on a mount while you are unmounted. Or same for a rogue. Ruins their charge or stealth opportunity, saving you a cooldown or two.
---
Experience is the key, so just play mage and never stop thinking "what could I have done to counter that" whenever you lose (or win).
---
Since when does blizzard process feedback?
---
Haha yep, that's immediately what I thought of when I saw this.  It was a beautiful flight path, but good god, NO ONE must have playtested that one.
---
But, vanilla was never supposed to be hardcore.
---
WoW was literally designed as the casual MMO. It's hardcore by modern standards, sure, but was not even close at the time.
---
Can you imagine having to load all that, all the mobs and NPCs, and players though? Can't imagine too many computers would handle it.
---
That's a whole lot of Ashbringers! :)
---
This green one was the absolute best looking one by a mile, well in my subjective opinion at least. 
---
What's the point of a beta without feedback? Surely the idea is for players to test the game and report bugs. And Blizzard to act on those reports. 
---
If I had to pick one from all the styles, this is my favorite overall https://www.wowhead.com/retribution-paladin-artifact-weapon-ashbringer-guide#screenshots:abc:6
---
High res, but reminiscent of the original. Of the corrupted ones, I'm with you on green.
---
LOL
---
My main was Aman’Thul through classic. MYTH was my guild. Our claim to fame was that we were the first and only* guild to down Rag before TBC :) 
---
* Horde guild that is - plenty of Alliance guilds got a lot further than we did, but we’ll ignore that ;) Actually, I can still remember the guild leader relaying messages of congratulations to us from the main Alliance raiding guilds after we cleared MC. The community was very real back then. 
---
Wtf is this
---
This is full of so many unlikely hypotheticals that you have not convinced anyone.
---
Wtf are you even on about.  They are going to have loot trading becaues the alternative is gross and not manageable.
---
there's a bit more to it.
---
- a) humans hit better for more damage and more threat
---
- b) NElves dodge better, which is great. But leads to less rage, less rage, less damage, less threat.
---
You may have the edge with a little more survivability, but at a slight gimp to the raid. Keep in mind that even if it's low, and you're 10DPS behind the human, that's 20 threat, so 20 dps missing from 20 other players, the raid's down 400dps, or one ret pally's worth :P
---
"Can I keep up with a Human Warrior by using all the consumables they're also using?"
---
I think my favorite ones beside the corrupted ones were the Shattered Reckoning ones style wise, but the color options were a bit bland on that model.
---
Except you don’t spec lightwell
---
Most of the mage tower variants were awesome looking, since they were the challenge mode solo encounter skins. Basically a visual way to show off your mastery of the spec.
---
Statistical sampling might've been too small or the weapon skill was lower, but I killed a bunch more and the life remaining is a bit closer. Easier to keep the rage high from the sunders though.
---
As cryptic as it is, the colors on database websites likely refer to something entirely different. At level 38 the quest actually starts out Orange, while the database website refers to it being red at 39. Had to double check just to make sure what the actual [SQL table says](https://i.imgur.com/JN7rbJu.jpg), and the quest level is infact 42.
---
I'm guessing it's more like a suggestion of difficulty at level x rather than a direct indication of when it changes color in-game. The reason so many in this thread seem surprised is because you'll notice a significant hit in XP rewards right at the start of the game when doing another factions secondary zone, ie Orcs in Tirisfal, even tho all you did green quests in both zones. It makes sense for rewards to scale when they're green.
---
You can farm on an alt or reduce consumable usage, replacing it with better gear.
---
From the description, 5 rotating warriors should be enough (those 4 debuffs are different, like in WotLK, right?). And taunt resist is just one more try, should not be an issue, RNG is RNG. Its chance is relatively low. Also I've heard that you can use spell hit trinket from some place to replace T3.
---
This is a great and creative use of the old talent system, imo. Well done. 
---
Seriously? That's pretty awesome.
---
How dare you
---
You have your mages click the light well, this is one more consume that wont be on cd when the soft enrage happens xD so by the end you have a your one tank, a bunch of mages and a handful of healers  what more do you need?
---
on the other hand, I would do anything to be able to use old models+casting animations.
---
these new Pixar characters are not for me.
---
Ya plus way easier access to guides and information these days. Gonna be alot more decked out toons this go around imo
---
The reason why the second original one is better is that the edge and back of the blade geometrically match the guard, as well as being more modest and thus more clean; the one in the first picture doesn't have a consistent design language, and has got too many design elements that make it ugly.
---
As I recall, any report made against a player was checked by a real human (only played till pandaria, so maybe now there is automation involved). That said, I only ever reported players who said terribly offensive things in public/group chat or directly threatened me via whisper. As for stupid comments, I might watch for a bit and then ultimately ignore them if they don't stop. For some, I'll even write the name down and refuse to group with them. 
---
Hi, /u/salamancas
---
All the more reason for me to put the word in quotes.
---
I think it vanilla the right balance. I never realized how much I hated Everquest until I played WoW. 
---
Amp/damp to prevent buffs being dispelled. Filler crap, basically. R1 ae is less Mana than r1 blizz I believe. Your points regarding rogue stands though.
---
I'm expecting that beta will be very short. Short enough that people are going to worry that there won't be enough time to change anything. And then people will report problems, and they wont' be fixed, and then it will be released.
---
I mean, come on, is there any chance of that _not_ happening?
---
The beta will be to catch problems that Blizzard cares about, not to catch problems the community cares about. As such, it won't need to be very long. Maybe a month or so.
---
Well yes this is still just a one keybind macro for the ability :P.
---
Whirlwind, Mocking Blow, Berserker Rage and Intercept are generally the abilities I'd dance for. Overpower would only be worth it if you had no rage and who even uses Thunderclap lol.
---
Retadin for scale.
---
You make very good points. It definitely seems more significant than a minor bonus to sword skill first appeared. Thank you for the input.
---
Wait is that in 144hz?
---
&gt;When you make eye contact with a white person
---
Care to explain?
---
I’d advise you do a history background check in EU before you start marketing campaign. 
---
its not 2006 anymore. modern pcs easily handle this. 
---
Ashenvale had that Lothlórien atmosphere to it. It was by far one of my favourites. Azshara was nice as well, but they should've finished developing the zone to make it great.
---
I don't know the model seems pretty decent. I think it has some weight.
---
I've never tanked in Vanilla, but I thought i remembered some kind of interaction between blocks and crushing blows? I think I remember it in reference to Druid vs Warrior tanking
---
&gt;Amp/damp to prevent buffs being dispelled.
---
Agreed. I usually spam a low rank mana shield, or slowfall for this. Especially against shaman. Although slowfall does use up a reagent.
---
&gt;Filler crap, basically. R1 ae is less Mana than r1 blizz I believe.
---
It is for sure. Even r1 blizzard is heavy on mana. I used to spam AE when a rogue vanished, but I think it looks kinda nooby compared to laying down a blizzard from afar. Since they almost always vanish to get out of a frost nova, so now I just stay in CoC range when I nova them to start a frostbolt. If they vanish and the frostbolt fails, they get hit with my big CoC.
---
Most white people make this face as a kind of "sup" gesture.
---
There's no data to train a model for these sorts of prodictions. He just did a correlation search, this is entirely garbage. He posted in the comments what he did. He assumes that he can use correlations between subscriber numbers and words in the quarterly report to make predictions about future expansions. It's just an overfit model. 
---
I worry about this too. Let's do some math: say 1 million players subscribe when classic launches. Now, I assume that the majority of players are going to be like me and you: cautious. That is, I'm only going to buy one month because I don't trust blizzard anymore. If the game is great, then maybe I'll buy 3 months to get the discount but I think the majority of returning subscribers will be monthly payers. So, at the high end, that's about 17 million dollars that Activation makes that month. That company made 1.4 BILLION last year. 17 million is NOTHING compared to that. Yes, if the subscribers hold, then that's 120 million a year which is good but that's only IF they don't screw it up.
---
That said, I do see Activision throwing in micro-transactions in the future. This will of course result in the majority of us unsubscribing but, Activision is now gaining a reputation of not listening to reason and subsequently making terrible decisions and this will be right up their alley. So, I'm very very worried about the state of classic wow..
---
You know no retail means no classic right ?
---
So why cant Blizzard say that then?
---
Because he trained a model to use Google search terms to "guesstimate" subscriber numbers until the model could use that metric to get close to the actually released numbers. That means instead of actual official numbers he can use the same Google search terms to "guesstimate" the current levels of subs.
---
They have, people here don't believe them. 
---
It worked on a good few abilities before they changed the scaling.

---
Sharding on rp servers is only turned off in old zones. "Heavily populated zones" have sharding even on rp servers.
---
It worked on a good few abilities before they changed the scaling. https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/609469-Hunter-spell-damage
---
Or the sub boost is a win for them and they have plans to aggressively monetise it using the half truth of it being semi free. 
---
I’m a bit cynical I know and man I really do hope you’re correct I mean that with all sincerity. 
---
Show me that quote then. As far as I know they have talked about "especially in the early zones" and there "needs to be only one hakkar" etc...
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/warcraftdevs/status/1022566187266232320?lang=en
---
This tweet suggests otherwise. Notice "needed for launch events" - this is exactly what they are saying now. 
---
Hi thanks for your comment! Tbh I gave up totally, I spent a lot of time fighting with Blizzard over the years and a few years ago I moved to Asia so the call center timezones are crazy, I'd have to wait up until like 2am to talk to someone on the phone. 
---
I'll look into it for sure but I can't get my hopes up, I've pointed this out (bots getting unbanned after WotLK came out) but they never seem to listen.
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Here's a reply I got from them in 2016:
---
"I totally understand why you are looking to have the previous closure re-evaluated. In regards to past penalties, these are not re-evaluated.  Penalties are decided based on what was done and what our stance is at the time the penalty is applied.  While that stance may evolve over time, it doesn’t open up a case to be re-reviewed. 
---
While I get looking to have an account back after being without it this long,  we tend to keep things consistent across the board.  Making a decision to overturn a penalty for you from several years back would go against our initial decision and open the door for anyone else to dispute things from several years back.  As we are not going to do this for the customer base on a large scale, I won’t be able to make an exception in your case.
---
While going forward we may take a more lenient stance, I’m afraid that it doesn’t change our ruling for issues from the past. I won’t be able to reactive your old account for you at this time. "
---
Surveys have shown PVE servers will have an older player base so perhaps you'll find more like-minded individuals there.
---
Activision need to be burnt like EA was with its aggressive monetisation of their games. I just hope that it’s not classic wow they try to push us to the point of totally rejecting a game, just to find out how far they can go. 
---
Let’s face it the wow token in the context of classic is pay to win, and if starwars battle front 2 has thought us anything it’s that you cannot remove the stink of pay to win regardless of how good the game is after the pay to win is removed and the controversy has died down. 
---
Perhaps they have something more sinister in mind for monetisation or, hopefully the above reply to my initial comment is correct, Classic will be classic and there will be no MTXs in the game and we all happily play classic until we are old and grey. I really hope the later is the case. 
---
You realise he’s doing his girlfriend, right?
---
So my dope ass sword on Diablo 3 is a reference to a WOW weapon?
---
Did they specifically say "without an extended beta"?  
---
PvP adds danger and adrenaline to the world.
---
tbh if you chose pve your doing a huge disservice to yourself, you enjoy group wpvp by the sounds of it, go join a world boss cololition and have a blast. as for being ahead of the zerg pack (the majority of players leveling), most people who get to be "5-10 levels ahead" are try harding enough that they dont care about pvp cause they know it will slow them down and its not worth it.
---
I ground to a halt at this level on PS also. Needed the next Priest wand from rare dungeon spawn and it just wasn’t happening. Figured I’d save the grind for Classic instead.
---
No, Beta for Blizzard is "preview hype" which is why every streamer gets a guaranteed invite.  
---
I wish they still did betas, then I'd have more hope about Classic beta.  
---
&gt; The beta will be to catch problems that Blizzard cares about  
---
Hmm. No examples are coming to mind lol.  
---
Same here, group chat etc has been great. But world chat is a shit show unfortunately. Luckily I won’t be on a US realm for Classic.
---
I see stuff this like and get a warm fuzzy feeling
---
Stop making these boring videos and stop spamming us with them. I can’t imagine why you think anyone would want to hear your awful voice drone on about this stuff. So self-masturbatory and weird. 
---
I thought it was a wave of light flashing across a red battlefield....yknow like how rez's have that crazy light explosion.
---
They just described sharding as a permanent feature kicking whenever needed. EXACTLY why people are worried about sharding in Classic.
---
That's 20s for ya! Use what you got.
---
Tanking in aoe thunderclap has its place. 
---
How is it ironic? I don't understand.
---
In my experience they have been:
---
Slam
---
Mocking Blow
---
Demoralizing Shout
---
Thunder Clap
---
Cleave
---
That about does it for me. Also don't do Windfury Weapon. There's better weapons at that level range.
---
What if I just Mindblast spam it to death and only cause mental damage?
---
Remaster would be extremely expensive. Just think of all the items that would need a rework. There are hundreds, if not thousands of unique items and then there are also the general appearances for more items. Considering it may take like 2 or 3 days for them to create 1 item, even with the reference, it would take years just to create these.
---
Taz'dingo, brother in arms!
---
Classic could easily support itself and turn profit otherwise they wouldn't be doing it to begin with.
---
I think this is because it's free to access these areas of the game, and they don't have to choose between buying meth or playing WoW. Thankfully if they do pay they won't make it far enough. Their sexist/racist/hateful rhetoric will oust them sooner or later and they will loose all their progress. I was scared about it for a while but with the click report system it'll be even easier to whittle down the rough edges of the classic community. As for PvP servers, I'll be there and I'll be waiting for you!
---
Yeah. Just think of it. You are going to think of a green lvl 28 shield when you get a level 60 epic shield. How crazy is that?
---
I don't have a need to prove anything to you , Classic will prove to you very well the things i say.
---
You believe that Private Servers are accurate , god how fool someone can be .
---
You know , when you ask for Evidence , i could give them to you within a single bit of seconds , but you know , there is a thing called "nothing is for free" .  
---
Pay and get it , otherwise you will never have it for free , nobody is here to provide you free service for you or your private server to pick it free for granted and script it.
---
I joined my guild toward the end of vanilla and their main focus at the time was ZG. I think MYTH rings a bell...I can't actually remember my vanilla guild's name because we split when TBC was released. For all I know it was MYTH lol. 
---
At least I spend my time creating stuff and not just trolling people on reddit ;)
---
One interesting note I have heard about the new water texture is that players can't hide beneath it. 
---
Basically, a boss has a base 15% chance to Crushing blow (+50% damage on an auto attack, so like "half a crit" as Crits are +100%). A boss also has a 5.6% chance to Crit. All other hits you take which arent dodged/parried/blocked/missed are regular hits.
---
The thing is, you CAN push the 15% crushing blows off the hit table, but to do that you need to hit 100% chance to Dodge, Block, Parry or be missed. 
---
If you have, say, 15% dodge, 15% parry, 5% chance to be missed, (and over 440 defense so zero chance of being crit) and 50% block chance, that would be 85% combined, but the boss would still Crushing Blow you 15% of the time. It is very difficult to hit 100% combined avoidance/block with pure gear. I think it was impossible in Vanilla but possible in TBC with very specific gearing. 
---
HOWEVER - the key is the warrior Shield Block talent. This adds 100% chance to block for the next two swings (when talented) lasting 5.5 seconds. Even in the world's crappiest defense gear this means that whilst Shield Block is active, any hit you take will be blocked (or dodged/parried). This is what pushes Crushing Blows off the hit table for Warriors.
---
It's also why Druids take exactly 15% crushing blows all the time, as they only have Dodge and Miss chance, but they potentially have much higher armor than warriors so it's not quite as bad as it seems. Also, Crushing Blows is one reason Protadins arent very good. They dont have +100% block chance from Shield Block, they get +30% block chance from Holy Shield for 5 blocks, and +30% block chance from Redoubt AFTER beign crit. This is better for tanking lots of little mobs than a warrior, but there's basically zero way to guarantee high uptime of both together so a Paladin will take lots of Crushing Blows too vs a boss as the generally wont be near 100% block.
---
The hot breaks on damage and doesn't scale with healing
---
correct. either way it's a change. so, um, let's chose the one that doesn't destroy the pvp scene? 
---
I've found Azshara to have bountiful amounts of Dreamfoil and other useful end game herbs (and unfortunately un-useful ones like Golden Sansam). The fish bite particularly swiftly, sometimes I've even found globules of Elemental Water on the end of my fishing pole! The Hydraxian Waterlords is a necessity if you like raiding. You know what? Visit the Hydraxian Waterlords more. They are out there fighting the good fight and they never get any visitors. Go hang out with them and set up a little campfire glitched underwater and you can all have a good laugh about it. If you're like me and have no life you'll post up in Azshara for 12+ hours waiting to sound the bell to a hundred sleeping warriors if the Blue Wyrm Azuregos dares return to seek and collect more items of immense arcane power (this is a good time get caught up on podcasts ((I suggest the Adventure Zone, MBMBaM, and the Beef and Dairy Network Podcast)) or make some progress in that book or show you've put off.) Just make sure to leave the text box visible so you can see his zone-wide /yell! Azshara also boasts some particularly high priced gray items off of the hippogryphs. Much like Winterspring, Blasted Lands, Un'Goro, the Dragons of Nightmare spawns, and Badlands, all of these zones will be seeing plenty of activity from those that are already level 60 and honestly I couldn't ask for better end game zones.
---
Same. The only reason we played with graphics in 2006 like they were is cause thats all computers could put out. Give me the new models, HD graphics, the whole 9 yards, put any gameplay flaws aside, I think BFA is probably the most beautiful expansion to date. I'm fine with a toggle for the people who really want potato graphics, but i think to appeal to the broader market a revamp would be huge. 
---
9.0 yards ≈ 8.2 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

---
Exactly. And this sub is tame compared to /r/wow. The amount of pure unfiltered pants on head stupidity/circlejerking and straight up lack of knowledge i read on there is off the charts. It's actual cancer to read 
---
Technically there is another Inn of the Loch Modan color scheme in Dun Modr (The Northern most Settlement in Wetlands) But It's filled to the brim with Dark iron Dwarves.
---
I'm actually hoping that we get progressive servers like Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King when Naxxramas gets beaten where they allow people to transfer existing characters. That's my dream. It'd be like a soft reboot of WoW except people could choose what they wanted to play.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't get any info until a month or two before launch. Honestly the more time they work on fixing it the better....hopefully.
---
&gt; I'm glad Blizz struck a compromise and will include the option of playing with updated terrain and textures.
---
Source?
---
Nah if blizz keeps sharding I'm out and back to p servers right away
---
The way i did stance dancing was making sure I put the stance itself on the same hotkey as the ability i'd want to swap for it. EG, I might have Thunderclap on 4 on by Battle Stance bar. I'd make sure that I had "Change to Battle Stance" on 4 in both Defensive and Zerker stance.
---
That way all I needed to do is double-press a button to get access to every skill I had. Intercept on Q? Didn't matter what stance I was in, Q would either intercept or swap me to Zerker ready to hit Q again.
---
As people say though, Tactical Mastery helps a tonne. I couldn't play warrior without high Tactical Mastery talent. 2 points is minimum as a tank for Mocking Blow, 4 points allows you to Thunderclap from Defensive stance, and if you're going 4 points you may as well go the full 11 in Arms to get Anger Management.
---
NOTE - Anger Management is one of the best talents ANY warrior can take because the description is wrong. It hurts my soul to see so many bad guides ignore it entirely. It doesnt JUST reduce your rage decay when out of combat. It gives you 1 rage per 3 seconds IN combat. It is the best single point rage gain talent you can possibly take by a mile. It makes Bloodrage give you extra rage due to it putting you in combat. It makes you have 100 rage when Onyxia lands because it ticks up the whole time she's up there. It creates more rage than any of the "-1 rage cost on X ability" talents. 
---
11 Arms for anger management should be, in my opinion, 100% vital for every warrior spec whether tanking, pvp or dps. No question.
---
You mean you cant just train models until they get 100% accuracy? /s
---
Retail RP servers not having sharding in old world zones is indeed a positive in my eyes. 
---
However, I think I can answer you somewhat *retorical* question if you are open to a counter argument. 
---
- RP servers presumably have a somewhat stable population in old world zones. There is no new content there after all, so people that rp there are those who rp over te long haul, and I dont see why this should fluctuale much. Therefore blizz can predict the sizes of shards and thus have a population, population density  and server cost upper limit - predictability. Classic is completely unpredictable, with potentially high population and population density spikes, and with that the possibly of current server tech (and/or cost cutting) requiring sharding to cope.
---
- RO servers are relatively niche and/or low pop, so even if they may (worst case) be more expensive, they don’t put a dent in the overall cost of retail wow. Classic not so much - here any added cost would scale with the number of players. 
---
- RP servers giving you the full sharding experience in current zones, shows thay they don’t turn off sharding for a second in any but the most niche cases on retail. 
---
Hope you really consider these observations about the very real limits to RP server non-sharding and differences between classic and RP population numbers. I’m not saying I am absolutely right, but, from your text, that this is something you probably haven’t considered yet. 
---
It had the highest margin of growth because the timing it came out, people had just started getting adsl, there was a huge marketing push by blizzard, celebrities were announcing they were playing the game and pretty much nothing else came close around that time that gave a similar sense (aka alot of casuals came on board).
---
If you were to replicate in 2019 and a whole new game similar to Classic were to release it wouldn't have similar success also there are far too many other games released today that provide a complete online experience vs back then
---
I kinda have the same problem. I identify as an Apache Attack Helicopter, but there's really not a class in game that kinda fits this identity. So I too am puzzled what to choose. I was thinking about Shaman perhaps, because they can cast ranged spells and totems kinda remind me of a helicopter rotor. 
---
I can't reply on the WoW Forums but I 100% will make a point to join. Will RP events be Bi-Faction? This concept intrigues and delights me to the HIGHEST degree. I can't wait to see how members of the Argent Dawn struggle when dealing with old grudges when standing up to the evils of Azeroth.
---
[This](https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2014/usgamer/GnomeFemaleFaces.jpg) is not a slippery slope fallacy.
---
I've been playing Alliance the past couple days and I was able to help someone out asking where everyone got all the glowing weapons. Literally nothing feels better than easing someone into WoW.
---
Well we don't know for sure if this is accurate or not, but one thing I definitely know is that BfA is at all time low sub count, even lower than WoD and it's only beginning of expansion yet the game feels more dead than Legion during content drough.
---
Training data: google trends (y) and population reports before mid-WoD (x). 
---
Model output (y): prediction of pop numbers given google trends (x). 
---
Words on quarterly reports are of cause vague and I agree that they don’t enable mind reading. Aside from that, the method looks just fine!
---
Omg why lightwell go for Silence and VE!!:-D
---
Nice trick!
---
Occasionally RP events will be bi-lateral. Once we've established our Horde-side sister guild. Initially the guild will be spun up Alliance-side.
---
tauren also have a hidden racial, +2 yards on their melee rage, depending how close classic stays to the original. that alone is *holy shitballs* amazing when it comes to pvp.
---
2.0 yards ≈ 1.8 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---
The blue dots are official numbers reported by Blizzard so those are accurate for sure, the rest looks reasonable to me.
---
&gt; the game feels more dead than Legion during content drough
---
If you consider they heavily use cross realm zones to pretend the world is populated, it's even more sad IMO.
---
Disgusting.
---
Why not go get those juicy holy talents that improve your healing by crazy high amounts?
---
So many wasted points in disc. Err..20% from P for 20 secs on a 3 min countdown?? You get that kind of healing power increase EASILY from holy. 
---
what are your opinions for [Blight](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7959#created-by) when leveling? [Executioner's Cleaver](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13018), while obviously better, isn't always available, plus is tends to cost an arm and a leg. this polearm, while way faster, seems like a reasonable alternative, especially given how shitty dungeon drops are at that level range.
---
is faster speed that much of a problem?
---
Sorry, I just wrote stuff before reailizing that you know exactly what you are doing:)
---
They literally answered this... I mean its on video. You would have to purposely misunderstand several sentences he specifically said in order to NOT get the message. Watch the video again and listen to his specific examples.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
How the hell would his example of you locking down all the thorium nodes in a zone be possible at ALL with sharding. What exactly do you think he meant when he explicitly says "Thats why we are considering a TIME LIMITED implementation when people are all in the **starter areas**"
---
I mean damn. He spelled it out with a world boss example. He spelled it out with examples of tradeskill nodes being limited/fixed number per zone, and specifically referenced only the launch more than once and people are still saying "THEY NEVER SAID THAT!".
---
At this point I guess you can just go ahead and believe what you want, but the rest of us heard what they said. 
---
List of bannable behaviors includes:
---
&gt; throwing games, going AFK, bad language, and harassment
---
Assuming "bad language" means racial or homophobic slurs, then good riddance imo.  There is nothing wrong with a community saying *"you're an asshole and we don't want to play with you.*
---
This build like a man in public with no pants on, either call the police cause hes crazy. Or that man knows exactly what hes doing ;)
---
Well its lucky that loatheb only deals damage once every 30 seconds at most then huh? 😊
---
Haha totally
---
Ya, like sliced right on top, boyo
---
Yeah, there's some pants on stupid head shit in this thread, like #NOCHANGES because they don't trust the literal creators of the game, completely missing the point that, surprise, they actually know what they're doing and there's a legitimate reason for very limited, short time sharding at the very beginning for reasons you outlined. Sure, they make mistakes now and then, but overall the game developers know that a pure classic experience is the ultimate goal and spouting shit like they don't know what they're doing is just antithetical to a good discussion and a good community experience. 
---
Yeah it's like... We made eye contact but I either don't know you enough to talk to you, or can't be bothered. 
---
Excuse me. *My* Jaina doesn't have a single grey hair.
---
Different strokes, etc. Still excited for classic, but I quite enjoy the current story as well. Definitely would not be painting with such a broad brush as if it's fact, far from it, It's certainly far from a downgrade or anything. Not to mention, we're still seeing it play out. 
---
Too late, 20ateteens above already went on a huge rant and said it's shit cause they don't personally like it, gg this sub 
---
Clearing MC and getting r14 on multiple servers for 10 years takes its toll
---
Took me a second :P
---
Huge hyperbole is hyperbole. Retail audiences and classic audiences are vastly different and incompatible. They're developing retail for the retail audience and classic for the classic audience. Sure they've fucked up a bit in BFA but it's nowhere near WoD levels, and even then they realized their mistakes and course corrected. They're absolutely worthy of trusting, even with the mistakes in mind, again seeing as they're entirely different goals and audiences. Trust the community over Blizzard? Fucking lol, like multiple others said because blizz listened to the community too much is the reason many mistakes were made in the first place in the past.  No, absolutely take community input into account but it by no means should be a blank check or anything at all. 
---
There's no point in arguing with people like that. They absolutely did think about those things back then too 
---
Yeah, it's rare i consider something straight up completely wrong, but i think he managed to hit that mark 
---
If fucking jagex can do it then blizzard could in their sleep, easy 
---
Eh that's not the easy way. Listen to their talks, even just getting vanilla back is a fuck ton of work. TBC and Wrath is gonna be too. The easy way would be just vanilla and call it a day. 
---
Lmao what even is this sub with comments like this 
---
STV - group up tho
---
Not with a completely different audience and focus, no. Retail and classic players are so different theyre not even worth comparing. Theres a reason the classic sub is lumped with the retail sub, because there's virtually no overlap. 
---
The demo
---
I was thinking about how the armory will work, in classic. What do you guys think?
---
I'd shed some light but Dino and the Devilsaur Mafia would probably break my kneecaps for talking. 
---
Deep frost. 
---
Because every holy pally in the game wears it from BWL until forever (most won’t reach the shield in naxx).
---
The demo had, by all accounts, all the original textures.
---
I feel like I've missed out a bit in vanilla. I always played alliance until, I think, Cata so I've never experienced the whole shammy tank thing.  
---
TC only hits up to four targets thus its bad on bigger pulls
---
What are the minimum specs to run a 40-man raid at 60fps without drop at 1080p on high settings?
---
There is no reason to believe sharding tech will be used past launch and some things to suggest it won’t. However we have no idea until blizzard make an actual announcement 
---
DME jump runs? can you elaborate?
---
Can check it later but one cast of torment wont hold agro for more than the first tick or two of hellfire
---
Dirty alliance 
---
Who are you going to get the 8k gold from?
---
It used to do so, however it was since changed (in Legion prepatch methinks) to punish you if the volume of reports is high enough - in a short timeframe, as little as 10 reports is enough. That means a group of players may effectively shut down your ability to play the game, at least for a certain period (as long as it takes to appeal the mute) - Classic is much tougher to play solo, moreso without the ability to communicate.
---
Other possible punishments include forcing a name change (although you may choose the same name you've had before, in case someone forced a name change on you out of spite).
---
In general, automatic punishment reporting is a poor idea - being able to kick a player from the game is already abused in rated bgs to easily win iirc, and it turns into a somewhat fascist state - in Classic, you may ignore someone if you dislike what they say, in Modern you may take away their ability to speak. The limit of reports before a punishment kicks in also gives  a lot of power to multiboxers.
---
We should keep it Classic and leave automatic reporting out of the game provided that ignore list is uncapped (and maybe shared between characters on a server) so that one may still ignore people who say things they dislike.
---

- The Devilsaur Mafia sends their regards

And you didnt read what op wrote... never been till loatheb huh?
---
nope. guys making shit up
---
👀
---
Classic only continues whilst BFA continues.
---
&gt; The game ain't all about raiding 
---
But it's the place but where the best gear is obtained so it ends up affecting everywhere else (making grinding/instance-based farming faster, improving PvP capabilities...). It's not *all* about raiding but it is certainly the most important one. 
---
From dictionary.com

    1.  imitate
---
Yes, it exactly imitates what a GM would have had to verify to make it eligible for a loot trade.  It was also a lot more common than you think, even though it didn't happen often to an individual guild.  Tens of thousand 40 of man raid groups were running every week and even 1% of that tons of issues for the staff of GMs.
---
It is going to cause more instances of abuse which is unfortunate.  But it's primarily going to be a pug issue in dungeons which isn't going to break the game all that much.

There has to be a way to handle legitimate loot issues and the automated function that lets us trade under the conditions a GM would have allowed seems like a reasonable compromise
---
Hi, /u/tapuzman
---
ahh yeah that might be a problem then, at first thought i would say u could frost nova and stay out of auto range, but frost nova would for sure break from hellfire
---
Well according to our massive Survey. Not a lot of people are going to do Leatherworking.
---
I don't think that the Mafia is also a thing in Europe, so I think I would be fine.
---
I'm going to add a question myself, can you farm them with a Feral/Resto hybrid?
---
Didn't think so either, since I rewatched all of the Blizzcon panel about 2 days ago.  
---
Hair
---
The sole reason I was questing in Wetlands 😄
---
True
---
Everyone wants to buy it because it's BIS pre raid for warriors/hunters/rogues and you need 22x per set. So everyone who wants to raid early on wants to get this set ASAP, this is why the marked is so big for it, because u can only get like 12 leather a hour or so (but 2 factions, so only 6) So that's around 150 per day per faction, but the request for it is so big that the price often just goes up and up the week 1&gt;4 on the server.
---
Now it will be intresting to see if it will be the same on most servers when it comes out because people will be "more casual/not know BIS lists fully, or not care as much about BIS" But for sure devilsaur will still be very valueable.
---
On the most recent server i bought devilsaur set for 350g at week 2-3 and this was fairly cheap (cheaper then AH, that was 450 g for the set)
---
Also if u control the devilsaur area with 1 other friend u can get 12x per hour, that's 6x leather for yourself which will be around 125g/h. 
---
But ofc it's unlikely u will get 12 per hour because a lot of others will fight too and u might end up having to do 4-5 man groups which will greatly reduce the amount you get /hour and also the other faction will do 4-5 man groups so now sudenly you will have 10x people fighting for the 12 leather (which still wont be a low amount of gold/hour + it's fun with tons of pvp)
---
Then don't grp with the guy and put him on ignore? 
---
Its all about practice. Mage has the lowest hp and armor in the game but balances that with the best get out of jail cards (iceblock and blink) and the best Cc in the game.
---
Next thing to remember is that 1. Poly lasts a decade if not disspelled and 2. Instant casts are king in pvp (thats why elemental mage is really good later if you got some gear: blastwave and lowercd on fireblast while keeping iceblock)
---
Furthermore pvp in classic is a bit rock paper scissors. Not all classes are equally good against others. Ad a mage you should never die to a warrior but a will rather likely lose to a warlock with felhound (debatable i know), while a lock will most likely lose to a warrior in return.
---
I feel like you’ve answered your own question. If you’re going to be committed and level faster than the majority then PvP seems like the better choice. WPvP is too good to pass up on and if you hit 60 quick you won’t encounter much of the hell/fun that levelling with most of the pop brings. If you’re focusing on raiding your gear will be good enough to make you a hard target to gank. 
---
id be surprised if we dont hear something regarding a beta by the end of February 
---
I don't think there is any trick to it. If you have the skinning skill you can skin it. I don't know what the spawn time was in vanilla and a lot of the private severs manipulated the respawns of things to cope with server population. As far as competition goes, every man for himself. Pvp if you can but if it's same faction stealing your kill, nothing really you can do.  I'm not sure how effective mafias will be if severs are split by region. If you can't get 24 hour coverage it isn't effective. I'd also assume the price on the ah will be lower without a mafia to fix the prices. 
---
All I ever wanted was to study.
---
I‘m not sure you‘re in the minority. I would love to play with remastered graphics with 100% classic gameplay. A toggle in the menu would be great!
---
You'll have to hold on for it for a while then, because for the first few months there isn't even going to be enough money in circulation.
---
They are pretty easy for kiting classes. You can root or hibernate to get in some heals if needed
---
Any idea why the guide suggests doing darkshore instead of westfall? Less crowded i guess?
---
Whirlwind does a lot more threat and damage.
---
The only time thunderclap is useful imo is if you need the damage reduction, so maybe an offspec healer who is struggling. Often it's better to take the bit more damage so you can deal more threat so the mobs can die faster imo.
---
Has anyone tried leveling with both mining and herbalism, binding the tracking stuff to switch on every movement button or something. Has it worked out?
---
You just want a beta so you can play sooner. We all do.
---
Have you ever seen “world of roguecraft“ on youtube? :-)
---
For cash you can do stealth runs or pickpocket 
---
Blizzard, is that you? If so, please rethink why we want a beta, in-fact, re-read everything I wrote in the OP.
---
Hasn't really hit me how nice it's gonna be to come back to Theramore, woo!
---
So an example.
---
Will they use flying mounts. No. Clear and simple answer. Blizzard said no.
---
Will they use sharding as a permanent feature that will kick whenever needed? Probably not? They will probably use it at launch for X time in X zones. There only "needs" to be one world boss per realm. They never said it will only be one world boss per realm...
---
Do you see the difference?
---
You are looking at what they said. I am looking on what they didnt say and theh never said they will only use sharding at launch and in the starting zones.
---
Its that weird?
---
Got a good read and a good laugh, thanks OP!
---
Looks like Bitcoin charts
---
&gt; The easy way would be just vanilla and call it a day.
---
Yes. That was not the argument however. The argument was that TBC and Wrath are easier than original content for Classic WoW.
---
Reread and yeah you just wanna play sooner. There is truth in your post and it was well balanced to seem legit but ultimately it's all about playing sooner.
---
I've considered resubbing to wow for a few month prior to launch to increase the chance of a beta invite. I think i've had 2 or 3 total since TBC (incusive) but I imagine they prioritise people who play the PTR and provide decent feedback. That's what I was doing each time I received a beta invite. 
---
You'd know if your primary source wasn't Reddit comments lol
---
Fine by me. I dont want overly paranoid or people who think they can predict something as irrational as keeping sharding.
---
A moral code enforced by a minority of holier than thou zerlots who use authoritarian controls makes for a shitty experience.  A moral code enforced through the community shunning people who's behavior they dislike is the default human system of behavior and results in a much better experience.
---
What you can read minds now?  You should really share this superpower with the world.
---
&gt; Reread and yeah you just wanna play sooner. There is truth in your post and it was well balanced to seem legit but ultimately it's all about playing sooner.
---
Imagine telling someone else what *they* want, **especially online.** Anyhow, you're incorrect, as I stated in the OP, I have a serious concern that WoW Classic will have issues that a beta test could easily solve.
---
I do not care about playing sooner, I care about a working, functional WoW Classic with zero issues.
---
Goddammit!
---
I knew it. We’ll be seeing you some day next summer
---
It's higher priority then epic mounts, so most people use their first chunk of money for this. But true, i exspect less hardcore players then what we see on private servers so their will be a lot less buyers
---
Yup that is clear
---
&gt; Saying I'm bad at pvp is pretty baseless
---
Then why don't you enjoy PvP?
---
When did Blizzard say they aren't holding a beta?  And if they didn't, why would you have any cause for concern that they wouldn't?  Especially considering they've beta tested every product they've ever released iirc
---
Eh, I kinda like the war hungry bitch she's become. Peace talks have no place in warcraft.
---
But I have missed Theramore actually being a thing
---
Yeah this is why I like it too, it's a great early burst.
---
Perhaps presumptuous but it's the impression I get from the post.
---
Vanilla had issues, lots of them, and some were fixed and others changed. There will absolutely be issues regardless of bow much testing or how long a beta simply because we all have different expectations of what the game should be. 
---
Playing in a beta means losing all progress once the game is released. If you're cool with that then why aren't you playing a private server?
---
Ganking in WoW is often about owning territory for farming.  For instance, I ended up in a PvP fight with a druid 8 levels higher them over a group of high-value mobs we both wanted to farm.  I killed him once, he killed me 2 twice and tried to corpse camp me.  Eventually, I left because he won the battle over who would farm those mobs.  
---
Sure it would have been more productive not interfere with each other while farming, but we're at war.  People at war kill the other side and take their stuff.
---
I haven't played the rest of the games on your list, but I played Eve Online for a couple of years.  The biggest problem with the winner takes all PvP that eve does is everyone being risk-averse when it comes to picking a fight.  This results in fewer fights, and even more ganking.  
---
In wow you can pick a fight on a whim, and all you lose is 5 minutes of your time.  This leads to a lot more fights.
---
Can you explain this how this works on loatheb.
---
When did they say that they would? This isn't a 'brand new' product, it's a recreation, which is why I'm thinking the 'beta rules' may be different.
---
And when a company doesn't communicate, their fans get anxious, and we're getting closer and closer to the deadline. It takes a good while to level to 60 to do dungeons and raids, so they need to give people *at-least* two months of testing, sure, there's still time, but really I am just expressing a personal concern in the OP because they aren't saying anything and my trust for Blizzard is at an all time low.
---
[It's applicable to video games too.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Product_life-cycle_curve.jpg)
---
You need to be a class that can solo well, even at 60 with decent gear some classes simply can't solo them quickly enough without having to resort to kiting or other backhanded tactics that take too much time. You need to be able to face tank it and kill it in under a minute in order to have any success.
---
Other than that it's all about knowing the spawn locations and picking one and staying there all day until your bags are full.
---
I don't think bugs in 2019 for a 2006 product is excusable, especially with the hardcore fanbase willing to thoroughly test their product.
---
for the original release there were several phases of closed beta, with NDA, before the open beta.  I suspect that blizzard is already running closed testing now for staff and those staff will be given extra beta keys maybe 2 a week so they can gradually expand on testing all through the later dev phases.
---
I would expect a beta phase but it wont be as long as people think and you will also need an active account to be a part of it.  I am not paying $15 just to beta test for a couple of weeks, I will just wait for launch.  Honestly I think its possible they will do all testing internally, but in the modern age a beta test is part of the marketing hype, but this is not a NEW game so they may skip it entirely.
---
They will never just release it without any Beta. Worst case is some 2 Week "Open Beta".
---
There are other shifts. Multiplayer and cooperative gameplay is very common. A huge amount of games now have level progression systems that was popularised by COD MW showing that it works in an FPS. The number of F2P games has increased significantly and 100 hour plus open world roleplaying games like The Witcher 3 are much more common. It's a very competitive landscape.
---
What's a good set of levelling areas if you start in Dun Morough 
---
I guess that's better than nothing, but still not enough time for them to listen to feedback, that'd be more of a 'oh we forgot to hold a beta, quickly give it to them so it looks like we bothered' - and I can't see them doing that, unfortunately
---
I don't know why on earth you'd think an MMO wouldn't get a beta test. Oh wait, Karma...
---
yeah because expressing a legitimate concern is all about reddit karma, nice contribution to the subject.
---
You can just talk to the gnome to have Theramore back.
---
I am. And I've played in betas too.
---
It just doesn't feel the same though 
---
My most vivid memories regarding leveling and farming are exactly from Azshara. Counting days to come back there...
---
The subject is idiotic
---
I think the droprate for bodyparts should scale negatively with overkill damage cause if a warrior executes something for twice its hp there probably isn't much left of it
---
you're entitled to your opinion pal, again, great contribution
---
There will be a beta I think around the end of February. I tested it out on blizzcon from level 15 servers looked good. They definitely will have a beta they are just keeping quiet about it just now.
---
Same as on retail I'd guess. Might do a reskin to the classic mode for the feel but that is a big maybe I think
---
That 2006 product had many years of development behind it and still had issues, some perceived others real, it's not reasonable to expect a perfect experience with so little comparitive development time. 
---
Don't get me wrong I'm hoping for the best we can get and I will be reporting bugs etc and expecting fixes. There are things I want to avoid such as sharding etc, the key element of the game was always the server community and that is only achieved through interaction. There's no way to code an effective community it has to grow organically.
---
2m in a world 8 times as small makes a ton of difference 
---
Like I said, there's nothing to contribute. Not having a beta would be bad for a lot of reasons which is why they're obviously going to have one and which why this post is completely irrelevant.
---
I doubt there will be no beta, beta's these days are used for creating hype just as much as testing, so i really doubt they will skip that and don't use it to create more hype. 
---
I don't know however if i really want "hardcore fans" to test the game.  As i want a recreation of Vanilla, not a recreation of "Hardcore fan's favorite pserver" where you see all kind of reports that quest A or NPC B is different than it was on pserver X,Y or Z. Which will make it hard to test a lot things, since stuff would need to be validated againt Vanilla resources. 
---
 "It will completely negate raid farming for some of the top levelers."
---
Wrong because MC can be done with full green so Devilsaur is not that important
---
Where can I find the template?
---
Going Horde for Classic ;)
---
There will not be a mafia on the majority of servers, it’s mostly a private server phenomenon due to having disproportionate number of players:devilsaurs
---
&gt; As i want a recreation of Vanilla, not a recreation of "Hardcore fan's favorite pserver" 
---
pretty sure a majority of 'hardcore fans' want true vanilla and not private server implementations
---
and due to the servers being international 24/7. 
---
Remember that devilsaur leather wasnt added until patch 1.11 (the naxx patch). There is a chance Blizzard wont add it until then, unlike private servers. Don't spend too much time planning.
---
If you have a source about that open statement it would be nice to share it here.
---
Something to consider with devilsaur farming, the price is sky high on pservers because of the mafia. They control like 99% of the devilsaur leather on  the market so the price is kept high by them.
---
If there is no mafia on your server then you can farm all you want but this also means everyone else can farm as much as they want as well. On a retail server you're going to be undercut by everyone else that farms the leather during the hours you aren't there. The mafia doesn't undercut the mafia and the mafia blocks anyone that could farm leather to undercut the mafia.
---
Devilsaur leather/sets are still going to be worth a pretty penny but they won't be anywhere near as expensive as on pservers. Personally, I suggest finding ways to farm gold that don't rely on the AH. If you're a rogue then pickpocket BRD/RFD, hunters can do Mara, mages can also do Mara prior to DM N/E.
---
Will be fun to see a graph once classic has been out for a year and compare sub numbers
---
That too for sure
---
&gt; but if it's same faction stealing your kill, nothing really you can do  
---
This is how I know you don't know alot about the Devilsaur trade.  
---
&gt; I don't think that the Mafia is also a thing in Europe
---
wat
---
Again extremes only extremes..
---
It is a problem that theoretically only cheaters and/or jobless players are the only ones to be able to get R12+. You can't argue against that.
---
This system is horrible.
---
I'm sure quite a few want that, but the main question is can we test stuff properly after not having access to the actual product in like 12 years while memories might be clouded by pservers data and memories.  
---
So loatheb major gimic for a healer is that once you cast a heal spell ANY HEAL SPELL. You get a debuff that says you cant heal again for 2 minutes. So you go on a roataion each healer casting there absolute best spell on the tank. That means everyone absolutly has to bandage eachother and use greater shadow pots. If you dont consume. You dont get the fight. But our mages were slackers. So 2 interesting interactions i discovered.
---
1. Lightwell doesnt proc this debuff so thats 5 free hots.
---
2. If you die and proc the spirit of redemption, you can heal as much as you want for 10 seconds iirc. 
---
So you can throw a renew on your mages and maybe get in a cheeky greater heal off on the tank before you die. Then you use a soulstone, have no debuff and can throw out a whole new heal. With 5 warlocks and 2 druids you can see gow getting 7 spirit of redemption on a fight that is balanced around only 14 heals going out in 2 minute might be a bit cheesey 
---
I have levelled HUNDREDS of characters, many of those have been gnomes.  IMO the most efficient thing to do is clear your noob area, do the 4/5 quests that are very local to kharanos then jump on the tram and head to SW.  You can then complete all of Elwyn leaving you lvl 12, maybe higher if you complete every quest, to solo hogger and move into westfall.  By following this strategy then moving on to clear darkshire and lakeshire after your deadmines run you should be lvl 30-31 and ready to move to STV.  
---
At this point I normally take a trip collecting FP's for dun'morogh, wetlands, araithi, southshore and if you are feeling daring get the WPL fp too so you have quicker access to SM later.  There should still be a good few quests in wetlands that net exp so maybe worth doing a couple of those while you are there.  Once you done all of this you should be lvl 31/32.
---
HTH
---
It's not about what I can do as an individual. I wouldn't be shadow weaving in the first place if I wanted to be boosting my healing.
---
All of the priests in my guild have PI so clears are slightly quicker.    
---
None of us need the extra healing.
---
I'd much rather be doing 30min MCs and 40min BWLs than topping the overhealing meters.
---
And cross factions collusion being against the terms of service. Hard to prove, but could for sure results in a ban. 
---
I see. I didn't release that you weren't affected by the debuff when in spirit of redemption form.
---
I mean, yea ... but I  always attributed higher level quests giving more exp because they are intended for higher levels that require more xp to ding lol.
---
Sometimes its better to do em.
---
Yeah, but since this is very much a sub optimal spec for a lot of fights in naxx, id be weary of bringing it up to your raid leader when the time comes to do some naxx progress. D: 
---
Thing is, changes can't happen. If we want all the good we have to accept some of the bad things as well :)
---
Male orcs might be fine but my female orc was a bad ass warlock and now with the new model her eyes are huge and bubbly and she looks as if her IQ dropped by a 100
---
There absolutely will be patches.
---
It's fine if they don't do a beta, WoW:C is still going to be great.
---
weird like our comments got downvoted right ? this subreddit has been hijacked by activision fanboys
---
There is no way they are skipping the beta. For a short amount of time during the demo the community found so much, that I am sure bliz will roll out an alpha even.
---
Let's not forget, this is free QA for which people get paid salaries and still they can find a fraction of what a whole community of hardcore fans can.
---
Nah I’ve killed loatheb as horde and I main priest, if you think lightwell is useful then good for you, but most think it’s a wasted talent point, you won’t get a raid invite from me.
---
Blizz has never done a beta shorter than 4 months.
---
Also true.
---
The assumption I made with that statement was that there was no mafia. If there is one, and you're not in it, then there is nothing you can do period. 
---
We’ll just have to wait and see :)
---
I've not even bothered getting my profs to max, there are literally no max level enchants
---
Yeh I know what it does, but three shadow pots, two bandages and a health Stone is sufficient. Shouldn’t have to go a sub optimal spec because your mages (best farming class in the game) are slackers.
---
Tri spec is 17/11/23.
---
You get imp mana burn in the disc tree.
---
The main point is to get silence in the shadow tree. Thats the weakness in the build you linked.
---
Theres 2 points in my build that you can move around if you dont plan with a lock and dont want 4/5 shadow weaving.
---
You get holy nova mostly for rank 1s to pop rogues out of stealth.
---
This smile reminds me of this cat 😅  https://tenor.com/ZlGV.gif
---
Yes, very easy if you keep herbalism on default.
---
Nodes are easier to spot.
---
Mining is easy: smelt copper to 65.
---
65-125 go in the cave in wetlands
---
125-155 youll see tons of iron
---
155-175 smelt gold
---
175-300 you mine what you see and can come back at 60 at that point you already made a fortune levelling both.
---
The hardest part is herb 50-100 xd
---
I'm sure that point in Silence is gonna help the raid a lot more
---
I have leveled hundreds of characters on vanilla as well. Mostly dwarves.
---
I concur with what this master has shared.
---
I only add to pick up easy turn in quests on your way to get flight paths.
---
Male Tauren looks like some furry fantasy now.
---
In the right front u can find a rare mob😋
---
I don't what this data refers to but aren't RP-PVP realms infamous for poor faction balance?
---
RP this and RP that. Doesn't like 1% play RP?
---
It is not "the community" saying we don't want you, it is Blizzard, who wrote the rules, and a small group of motivated players, who pressed report.
---
I don't have a problem with these rules per se but I do very much have a problem with their advocates couching it in euphemisms like "the community" (they mean Blizzard) and "don't want to play with you" (they mean ban you). It strikes me as very disingenuous and makes me question your intentions. 
---
It refers to [this survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9yt514/world_of_warcraft_classic_census_and_demographics/)
---
It is actually the opposite - the only RP-PvP servers in the EU are the only ones that have balanced factions (and thus had proper WPvP). Dunno about other regions, though.
---
Only reason Devilsaur leather is super expensive is because there is a HUGE demand and limited supply on some private servers with 50k pop and 10-12k peaks. I don't think Classic will have that kind of pop on the realms so the supply will be the same but demand much lower.
---
There ia the quest in stv at 31 that gives a nice lvl 40+ wand.
---
Check out venture compagny mining.
---
The wand is a goblin igniter.
---
You can duo/trio it at lvl 31 with a warrior if they dont want to do their whirlwind quest. They get a close enough 2hander out of this until they can do the sm quest on alliance.
---
A question instead of an answer. 😢
---
Your right, if i had it my way i would be deep shadow. But in all fairness making a build that shits all over the design on arguably the 4th hardest fight in a 15 raid boss teir is pretty funny. Cause at the end of the day you want consistant kills. By sacrificing power infusion i had the numbers and gear to do almost ALL  of the fun jobs in naxx
---
1. Meaxna paladin cheese. I was the healer for when we broke bubble.
---
2. Instructor razuvious mc tanking
---
3. The crucial horsemen shackler on gothik
---
4. 4 horsemen, you better believe people werent making fun of my lightwell in the rest area
---
5. Grand widow mc fun priest. 
---
6. Gluth. Running around gathering and kiting zombies and shackling any that got to close to the boss
---
7. Higen. Do the dispel on the tank and the absolute clutch timing
---
8. Well ive talked enough about loatheb. 
---
9 kt. Shackling and mindflaying the adds to break them up a bit in phase 1. 
---
On top of all this. I was able to play like a shadow priest on non healing intensive fights. 
---
Did i go oom without those disc talents? You bet i did (well tbf it was fight specific. Was it  hella in naxx
---
I'm sure there no void storage, but is there regent storage (doubt it, but wanted to ask). 
---
Awesome thanks. :)
---
This should be the post credit scene from Deadpool 2 with Ryan Reynolds killing himself. 
---
Honestly you could be a person who spends every waking moment RP'ing in the Deeprun Tram and I'm still going to suggest a PVP server.  
---
LW argument doesnt make sense either. There will always be someone for the craft no matter what. 
---
Hormones always ruining things.
---
Possibly. But progression tracking sites show many of the same guilds or at least the same characters in rearranged guilds, server after server, expansion after expansion. 
---
When you consider that in 2014 Blizzard announced 100 million cumulative subscribers, but in 2010 footnoted that 70% of players never reached level 10, it suggests that turnover is fast and at the entry level.
---
Instead, it's possible this chart shows a combination of "running out of new players" *and* a point at which the game fell short of expectations — I know where I think it is, but I'll leave that to the audience — leaving nearly half of a core subscriber base returning at launch to investigate each new expansion, with most subscribers choosing not to continue after a few months.
---
I mean, look. I played for 8 years. All I know is that I watched Wired's [History of Warcraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvrzZgZ2ZDw) last night. At the beginning I was nostalgic and curious about the old game and open world. In the last third I got a stress headache as all the modern must-do activities were introduced, reminding me why I left in 2016.
---
You know what man i tots agree with you under ANY other circumstance, in any other raid. I would fucking point and laugh at the priest who brought a lightwell. Ive already said that this IS NOT OPTIMAL but... holy fuck is it a funny meme, and it actually does have its uses. BUT ONLY IN NAXX
---
Remember not to use anti-classic formats. 
---
There’s one in dun modr, although not as friendly obviously  
---
Blizzard will hold a beta I imagine, but judging by their recent behavior they will just ignore the feedback lol
---
Fuck off, shitsout. Would rather just listen to the person who actually understands the game and not have it filtered through your greedy, balding ass
---
Is some common decency in just saying "we don't want to play with you" without the "you're an asshole" part too much to ask for? 
---
Can we just start banning people from this sub who post these "CaN wE jUsT" circlejerk bullshit posts ?
---
Never had any issue with reporting whatsoever, and I've gotten into a few arguments. Not back in the day, not again I started playing again in Legion. Same goes for my friends.
---
That said, I never flame somebody and I don't swear, with my friends taking a similar approach I believe.
---
It's very easy to get by and never being at risk of getting punished. Just keep your conduct civil and respectful. 
---
&gt; I care about a working, functional WoW Classic with zero issues.
---
You think you do, but you don't. You just want to play sooner.
---
:^)
---
in a way modern wow is the reworked version already. they already replaced most textures and items. its not about the items, but the engine. at that point they better create another mmo
---
&gt; recent
---
Implying Blizzard hasn't been infamous for ignoring beta/ptr feedback for the last decade in all of their games.
---
It's the hypocritical private server community too. They want changes to the game just as much as any retailer but they think their changes are somehow legit because "private servers have been doing it for years". Things like non blizzlike server sizes, dynamic respawns, "fresh" realms and shit like that.
---
It's fine if you don't like vanilla the way it was and want to play some approximation with a bunch of changes but don't try to act all holy and pretend you're asking for vanilla, you're asking for a fucking private server.
---
Some things are fine to argue about, things that are more philosophical. For example should the emerald dragons really be released prior to AQ now that we know to farm them for nature resist ahead of time which essentially nerfs the entire raid. 
---
haha fair enough
---
Alliance only. Horde might just have to make do with WWA, unless they can find a lucky drop.
---
Can I talk to a gnome to get the entire world back pre cata? Preferably classes and the whole game too? 
---
Nope, sorry. One leatherworker per server.  
---
You get a title with it too. Leatherworkerlord Nordinus
---
Let's be real here. The only reason blizzard bans people at all is because they get money out of it. If I ban 18000 overwatch accounts those are people who need to go buy the game again. Back when buying/selling gold was "illegal" blizzard only banned people bc there was a profit motive. As soon as wow token got thought up they abandoned all game integrity and followed the cash.
---
Yes, haven't you watched the Classic trailer?
---
It's not you that decide how things go :)
---
People are complaining about sharding and loot trading, it's also possible to at least tweak numbers / coefficients / decay in the honor system. We should complain because it's the only way to have a chance to be listened to.
---
Well, ganking is part of actual open world pvp aswell.
---
Good point I guess
---
[Let's not forget the source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOxkNOdpYPQ)
---
&gt;sometimes it can be subjective
---
&gt;but in my experience 
---
Not the best choice of words lol
---
Good point something to keep in mind!
---
Thank you! People like to separate some ”real” world pvp from ganking, but it is part of it. Thats where the faction hatred and warfare thrives from, not just the made up lore, that you suddenly would feel super attached to without having to feel the pain of getting slaughtered.
---
But like... how much time are you saving yourself by not being able to farm gold? I mean ive been in your position, my RL didnt want to do any work so he just took me at my word. Told him that since i do insignificant damage and my healing is gimped doing this spec that you want that i dont really need to consume since rank 1 swp doesnt use mana and that fights are over before ill go oom. It was ez raiding financially till i was bored outta my skull and told him i wanna respec cause its just not worth gimping yourself *that* much
---
Maybe stop getting so offended by all that if it's so obviouly wrong.
---
Just take the picture in the OP and remove the small images, enlarge image to the right.
---
It’s not what I said, but what was said in the video. It’s not about MC but your lifetime as a raider and speedrunner, including naxx. What do I know, haven’t raided beyond Vaell and that not since 2005
---
Titan btw
---
Ok thanks!
---
You have limited quest options at this range but Hillsbrad/Alterac turtles are a great grinding spot. One of the few I would recommend pre level 55 even if you prefer questing.
---
There is a quest for turtle meat at the Southshore inn. Easy grinding, plenty of meat to level cooking and they drop pearls too.
---
I love to gank. I too get ganked and I hate it. Thats where the faction rivalry and hate thrives from. Thats also how more people are invited to help to stop ganking, creating the bigger open world fights.
---
do a video on how to camp noobs
---
Downvote my post if you don't like it. I didn't do anything against Classic. It would be different if I would be promoting retail or depromoting Classic on the post, but I didn't so either downvote me and go your own way, or stop being angry.
---
Summer 2019 my child. 
---
&gt; least tweak numbers / coefficients / decay in the honor system
---
exactly what's NOT supposed to happen. Sharding is time limited for a very specific reason (surge of player numbers during start). Loot trading - i still don't understand the people who complain about this because it CHANGES NOTHING but people are too much of a blockhead to see this. Loot Trading is just faster than GM Tickets - the outcome or occurence of loot trading is simply not impacted.
---
Changing any form of numbers to get rewards - that's just "changing classic" and that's absolutely dumb and PRECISELY NOT what the "original" classic community wants...
---
Yeah but it’s my game and I need it now!
---
wow..... 20 min premade vs premade... that just sounds extreamly inneficient. I was part of a few rank 14 premades on Eu Kazzak and Eu Daggerspine back in the day and we would usualy just chat in IRC with the other factions premades. Every time we face against eath other 1 team would throw the game, just chilling in base farming a little honor, and then the next time we faced that team the other team would just throw so that the games would go really fast. All that extra work about having spies or having a sacrificial player just seems strange.
---
Should've shown Yoda seeking refuge on the Classic planet 
---
I'd want a reboot at this point. They've painted themselves into a corner both design wise and lore wise. Just make WoW 2 with a new engine and actually build from vanilla design philosophy. TBC was the only true expansion to vanilla wow. Around wotlk it became a couple completely different game. Just reset it all like the expansions never happened and learn from all of their mistakes.
---
&gt; This isn't an expansion, there won't be patches, and I find it inexcusable to launch with issues given the timeframe they've had. It will be pure negligence if there's anything out of place.
---
Oh how much i hate this kind of customer. You sir, are the reason why half this world has such a shitty attitude towards about anything.
---
There won't be any patches? It's called 1.12.1 for a reason. There will almost certainly be patch level increases to this version number. 1.12.2, 1.12.9, who the heck knows. But most of all what they will concern is bug fixes and not system changes.
---
It's INEXCUSABLE to launch with issues? How about you get off of your fucking high horse. And please fall on the ground face first. Developers are humans, too, you know. They surely try their best to find all the issues. In fact it's pretty much certain that Blizzard is putting A LOT of effort into recreating WoW Classic into a version that people will love again. But there WILL BE ERRORS. THERE WILL BE BUGS.
---
And most importantly, THAT IS OK. The only important thing is how fast certain bugs will get fixed depending on what impact they have.
---
It's funny how in a way I agree with you because they SHOULD hold a beta. They should let us test things because the MASSES can always test better than any SELECTION of people will.
---
But this one paragraph just outlined yourself as the kind of person I'd honestly love to NOT SEE in WoW Classic. This very attitude is the exact kind of player that has the potential to make WoW Classic NOT FUN. Please change yourself because YOU are a danger to WoW Classic, not any bugs that may occur.
---
I definitely prefer the Wailing Cavern shield from the turtle boss but as a horde player I'm totally partial.
---
Nothing to do with the fact I'm killing time by playing on a PS and just tanked WC. Or maybe it has?
---
Summer is coming but the long wait is killing me!
---
Which is a symptom of 10k pop private servers with a 24/7 userbase. Real vanilla realms were 2.5k-3k _at most_ (most realms weren't near this cap either), and only during peak hours.
---
Username checks out
---
How can u?🤨 Wow music is one of the best ever in all video game industry.
---
What has this post to do with classic?
---
No it must be recent , because evil activision 
---
Tokens redistribute gold and don’t generate gold.
---
Tokens kill China farmer.
---
China farmer generate gold.
---
Tokens good for economy , China farmer bad 
---
It's amazing how Blizzard is unable to acknowledge that all the casual friendly changes they implemented from late WotLK is the cause of the player count going down this much. You would think as its so obvious they would change back a little to how it was before but no. At least with classic they are finally doing something, although retail has ruined the community so badly, I hope it wont affect classic aswell. 
---
Wow top 5 highest crossing pc games 2017.
---
Classic server highest was at 100k player if we are generous. 
---
Sure 
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/awkward-smiles-Hpdvu6wHdeBqw
---
Man i remeber wow back in 2017... those were good times...
---
2018 and beyond though? Yikes
---
Its like that white person smile cat meme
---
I have leveled a warrior in a pserver lately, using rend and sunder instead of HS.
---
It was actually very decent, sunder is very noticeable, can proc overpower and weapon procs/enchants, and doesn't eat a whole attack worth of rage. Very good for slower weapons.
---
I leveled as full arms though, improved overpower is great and so is tactical mastery.
---
I'm pretty sure even hamstring spam with no kite is better than using HS ( it can proc deep wounds too).
---
Old good 
---
New bad 
---
Best example. Mop was hated. Now voted as second best expansion.
---
Cata zones got hated. People love them nowadays and ask to do 60-90 their too, because older zones suck. 
---
Garrisons worst feature ? People want it back now 
---
Legion legendarys are terrible and having to use one weapon the whole addon ruins the fun ? 
---
Now people want them back and ask for items to be used for atleast ,, 6 month „.
---
Bfa azerit is hated ..... you see the pattern ?
---
No chance on classic servers, due to timezones. The demand on servers is due to there alyways being someone controlling the spawns. Good luck with that, if EU/US players have to go to sleep. If you want your set, you wake up at 5 one days and have a free grind (gotta be able to solo them) until you have your set. 
---
And another thing people here dont realize is that what the devilsaur mafia did/does, wont happen in classic, due to cross server collusion (also griefing) is against the rules. If a mage from your own faction sheeps your devilsaur, then thats a ban. 
---
There were three items you could claim in vanilla, as far as I can tell; The riding turtle, hippogryph pet, and tabard of flame.
---
You redeemed the codes here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/promotion.html
---
Damn, that is sick!
---
Oh, hey Silvite! Fancy seeing you here! :)
---
(Minifanta on YT)
---
With some chocolate drops? 
---
Who the heck is saying mop was second best expansion??? Did they not have to do the dailies?
---
Or the content drought if SoO
---
As for cata you cant say that once you change the core flow of a zone and changing the level boundaries and say its the same. 
---
Id say people are saying they will take garrisons cause atleast in WoD the unfun content was automated so you could focus on the only content to do which was raiding (idk how pvp was in wod i have to admit but iirc people got pretty bored of ashran.)
---
The problem with legion legendaries was the acquisition of said legendaries. Do you remember when you were locked behind 4 lego's max per character at the start if the expansion. And people liked the legendaries themselves cause the classes were built around having them by the end.
---
Thanks!
---
Here he is again, cheerleading for BFA lol
---
Just like getting downvoted on reddit, reports are a bad thing in WOW. Popular opinion always can and will get exploited. For example, if you win a roll in a dungeon fair and square (for your main spec) and they are 4 friends in disc and all report you, thats pretty unfair, because its 4 vs 1. 
---
Probably the people say mop is best , are the ones who see all the flaws woltk had and are not nostalgic for classic. 
---
Some how I need to earn my paycheck 
---
Nobody mentions the lvl 101 Abathur? Dude, that‘s really Nice!
---
Use [this](https://my.mixtape.moe/neswgy.png). I forgot to dye a strand of hair in the OP. Also, if anyone has the original without all the JPEG I'd like to have it.
---
Bruh i can poke holes in vanilla and any expansion, they all got there flaws, i promise you im not wearing nostaglia glasses.
---
I was talking about you being shocked with mop being as loved as it is. 
---
Oh so he just does this? Huh was kinda wondering why someone unhappy that classic will be the wow killer is on the classic subreddit

Don't bother trying to explain this concept to redditors they do not understand it. 
---
It's been more than 10 years since the merger.
---
Explain were iam wrong than? But pls use simple words since iam a retard ;)
---
It would be less pathetic if you were actually getting paid.
---
Is there actually a chance there could be a lack of rogues in PvE since they normally have so many raid spots? 
---
&gt; I don't think that the Mafia is also a thing in Europe, so I think I would be fine.
---
90% of the mafia, counter mafia or even counter-counter mafia are EU. Also you only need a handful of crafters to make the sets while everyone can farm them. 
---
Look at his post history :P
---
Jinkies.
---
I would say that you should be able to set time away for yourself. Talk to your wife about, communication is key. You will prob be in the majority of players facing that problem so dont worry about fall behind:)
---
&gt; Giving us the ability to resolve that ourselves isn't gonna change the core game 
---
Even if they went for a 100% vanilla experience , without any changes, no sharding, loot trading etc , the game will not be the same with the access to information we have now about the game. But the fact that remains is , that you couldnt loot trade in vanilla, you had to be a responsible ML, if you didnt want to be labeled as ninja you were extra careful on needing loot etc. People are greedy by nature, they will abuse this 100% and the best  part is that you are never gonna find out that you got screwed. I will probably pass, i had a good vanilla experience anyway
---
Yo! ^_^
---
Happy to support you sir!
---
fair enough
---
Pathetic for liking a game. Sick 
---
If you're a herbalist, that place is pretty good for mountain silversage and dreamfoil.
---
No, don't have a phone.
---
It sounds like you already know family, job, and wife come first so that's great. One suggestion I have is playing on a PC in the same room or use a laptop on the couch with/without an earbud for sound while you watch Netflix shows. Leveling, farming, dungeons, and even raiding are as mindless as watching Netflix and I found I could engage in both. Aside from that I would expect you would have to use whatever free time you currently have for other hobbies to play. Also, one piece of advise - if your spouse doesn't like video games stop trying to introduce them.
---
Welp mop compared to cataclysm wasnt that bad.
---
Cata was top until the last raid 
---
Almost 2 years played on the most popular private servers here. Great experience overall, sure there were some infamous toxic guilds and players who added a bit of flavor and there were those that were irl threatening people for farming in their spot. For the latter i think it wont be an issue in classic since blizzard will probably do something about it, unlike private servers. Also accusing some1 of being toxic is a very subjective matter, saying fuck you, you are a noob , etc is considered toxic nowdays.
---
Get a divorce.
---
Classic is being brought back due to the recent failings of their more recent games.
---
Classic is a direct result of the reality behind this meme.
---
So a lot.
---
excuse me for being passionate about my favourite game, 'sir'.
---
Mauradon was my jam! Lots of good memories there!
---
I'm in a similar position now, 2 kids 3 years old and 9 months old, partner likes some old console games but not pc gaming. I'm currently trying to get her playing so I can have a pocket healer but with little success. I've accepted that i'm only going to get around 2 or 3 sessions a week for 2-4 hours max. 
---
Welp i actually didnt like the expansion in overall a lot of recycling but yes the last patch was shit, it ruined everything, mop started with the damage already done so in comparision it wasnt that bad, and the wod followup just... xD
---
Using a laptop in the couch is a good suggestion, I’ll do that. I actually disagree that dungeons are as mindless as Netflix; I think that dungeons require some focus, in particular as tank or healer. But leveling and farming stuff would work. And yeah, I have stopped those attempts many a year ago. 
---
Source for that ?
---
We should form a guild...
---
&lt;FamilyFirst&gt;
---
I think in cata it wasn’t recycling. While in woltk they just used old raids and changed the numbers. In cata they made completely new ones and brought some old faces back. 
---
The first raid tier was gorgeous and the pvp makes me still sad that we will never get it back. 
---
But the last raid was odd. While the last fight was awesome with spine and madness. 
---
The first 4 bosses were all replaceable and boring.
---
I know a few friends who would join ha. 
---
The only reason Devilsaur price is so high on private servers is because the populations are massive but there are still the same amount of Devilsaurs designed for a 3000 player server.
---
This means that demand is far outweighed by supply, resulting in high prices &amp; intense competition.
---
Another big factor is that on servers with progressive itemization (which we are told Classic won’t have) Devisaur Leggings are pre-raid BiS for not only Rogues &amp; Hunters but also Warriors because Titanic Legplates aren’t in the game yet.
---
The prices also get driven up further by Ungoro Mafia copycat groups on most servers since Nostalrius. These are cross faction collectives that work together to create a monopoly, ganking anyone outside their organization (on either faction) that tries to farm.
---
Assuming Classic has ~3000 player servers, Devilsaur prices will be much lower than on private servers. I also think it’s quite likely Blizzard won’t allow cross-faction cooperation to create Mafia groups. This was a very controversial thing on Nostalrius when it first happened and it was only allowed to continue because the admins there decided it was okay. Again, this was a very controversial decision by the Nost staff and I definitely do not see Blizzard being OK with this.
---
Srsly, on the P-Server I was on, there was no Mafia of sorts. You could farm them all day long.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Downside: dungeon runs would be super slow cause there is always at least one kid waking up.
---
Upside: we would all be very understanding that party members need to go instantly afk.
---
Dang, thanks for the heads up, never knew about this.
---
Although one thing that Bungie did do was by introducing matchmaking with a series of playlists that would switch around and that anyone could jmp in at any time and you could arrange custom games and clan games.
---
Thank you!
---
Yea I know. I mean, she is a reasonable individual and all, but if I expect her to please my desires, I should be as forthcoming in pleasing her desires. 
---
Based off what info? Private servers? Vanilla realm info?
---
This time around the playerbase is going to have a dramatic change and will produce unexpected results, as veterans, noobies and private server playerbases will all roll. 
---
There will be no way to tell.
---
I'm considering some training for the 3yo so he can cover if i need to step out. 
---
We'd end up a guild of people stuck at level 30ish, log on, fly to levelling zone, get called away and die while afk, corpse run, get called away and die while afk, corpse run, hearth and realise it's still set to SW so the process starts again next session
---
lmao
---
thank you
---
You'd probably be surprised about the amount of people who don't even know something was exclusive to private servers.
---
Nice, so Leatherworking could be actually worth something in the beginning.
---
Don't even waste your time talking to that guy. Look at his past history, he's a huge tool.
---
what is the point of a 4 month beta if they dont fix anything??? Have you seen the bfa beta?
---
The tokens generate gold because you can atleast in retail, buy them with real money.
---
Economy is a core aspect of Vanilla so I hope they are aware of it and won't put it in
---
And that would be ok with me! :)
---
I’d be impressed if you get your 3yo to cover for you when you go to mix formula milk, but please give a heads-up so we know why the mage is pulling all packs in the room.
---
Wow is a processer game so an up to date i5 quad core from the last few years and a GTX 1060. Please excuse me for not knowing AMD equivalents.
---
Bahaha
---
Thank you for fixing it.
---
You can abuse it safely and noone will ever notice or you can abuse the fuck out of it, get rich and reroll. Easy game. Have fun playing with others and taking their money.
---
The only storage in vanilla other than the bank or specific bags(herb bag, ore bag, etc.) is the key ring for the countless keys you acquire over time.
---
I mean you think about all the mmo's that tried and failed to be the next wow. A big f to them. But how ironic that that only one who really had the potential to topple it was wow all along :^)
---
[Source](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=activision+stock+price+drop)
---
This shows the average person not understanding the concept.
---
Okay how does it generate gold. 
---
You buy the token. 20$ 
---
You put it into the auctionhouse 
---
Somebody buys it for 130k gold 
---
Were was gold generated ?
---
got me 
---
Midnight? I often play after my wife goes sleeping) Luckily for me i work only 2 times a week)
---
Remember when games had significant beta tests done with paid professional QA testers and we got polished final products?
---
Stop holding water for a billion dollar company 
---
You seem like a chill dude, wishing you the best on your channels!
---
Couple questions: do you what you intend to main in Classic? Which faction?
---
The whole gaming industry has a similar drop. 
---
But must be Blizzards fault so let’s ignore that. 
---
Let’s assume bfa was so bad the activision and company’s who are not part of it like Nintendo ( dropped by 40%) dropped because of it.
---
Why didn’t they brought classic than in woltk ? 
---
Mid woltk the stock dropped by 50% too. 
---
Why not than ? Why did no one call that time out ?
---
Just some advice. If you want atleast a small community in streaming you should upload to youtube first and bring them to your twitch. Streaming at the bottom of the list to 0 viewers will never get you anywhere, and many people have done this for years. Growing on youtube is so much easier than on twitch.
---
Maybe because there are only two comments? No wonder you are second. 
---
Yeah maybe you have less PvP in those games, I don't know, since I played tons of PvP in Aion.
---
But a fight on every whim and 5 minutes to the Spirit healer. Does that sounds exciting and thrilling?
---
In the games mentioned, you would have your heart pumping, when you see someone, because you don't know if they are a friend or want to kill you in an instant.
---
And when you fight them, your hands shake, because your body is full of adrenaline.
---
It's a special kick, when you can loose it all and I think that is what the OP was talking about. You don't have that in WoW.
---
I say quality over quantity. It really doesn't matter if you duel someone, fight in BG or do open World PvP. It's all the same.
---
A guy on a private server for classic told me he bought BfA and never played it.  Ouch
---
There's a difference between being passionate and holding video game developers to an impossible standards. Bugs happen. 
---
The point is that mmo graphics aren’t cutting edge crysis level so they can allow for many types of different PCs to run the game reasonably without lag. Both to increase the potential user base and because lag can have an impact on more than just the user’s game experience.
---
I predict that this is what will happen. I need to get up 6.30 for work, and will still prioritize extra hours of gaming on the expense of sleeping...THE HYPE IS REAL
---
 Bruh Sound Effect #2
---
The concern isn't legitimate. They haven't said anything about beta or no beta so why assume something far outside the normal industry practice? This is just fearmongering
---
Dude, chill. Just don’t watch them if you don’t like them. 
---
to be fair, I don't expect it to be flawless, it'd be great to have no bugs, but to log on to major fundamental issues because they didn't allow us the ability to test would be a total letdown.
---
yeap its really bad so far, progression schedule, LT, sharding etc.  They didnt promise a replica but a classic vanilla experience. It doesnt seem that good so far, lets wait for the beta for more surprises
---
XD
---
Now, I haven't played WoW since I met my fiance.
---
Which is more than 7 years ago.
---
My tactic for Classic will be foot rubs.
---
A 15 min foot rub token should be good for about 1-2 hours of game time.
---
I’ll be there as often as I can!
---
I think he means that EU realms generally didn't have a Devilsaur mafia, which is feel is correct as i've never seen one until huge pservers. I think that the devilsaur mafia is generally a pserver thing, due to high pop caps (or no caps), 24/7 busy due to no regional servers and stuff like that. 
---
So what do you think about the kidnapped dwarf princess in blackrock depths, or Lady Onyxia's evil plan, what about the threat in the Molten Core, the defias brotherhood maybe? Did you at least care to know who are these statues in the Gates of Stormwind? You had to actually search or read for lore in vanilla in-game. You didnt do shit, goodbye , noone will miss you
---
Funny to see the blue dots disappear as Blizzard becomes more desperate to hide the fact that the game is dying 
---
Haha I agree, it should!
---
Also funny when you’re half way through Sunken Temple:
---
&gt;&gt;Ehm, guys, AFK 15 mins!
---
I always run taurens as my class....I hate the new models :(
---
Id rather have gold sellers. It’s not about the gold it does or dies not generate. Imagine being able to use real world money to sell tokens and get gold. Imagine being able to buy pre bis items or depending on your class bis items. Imagine never wasting time to farm gold to buy consumables or farming consumables because you sell enough tokens to be able to buy whatever you want. Tokens make it p2w for the token seller. It may take me a week to farm the mats for devilsaur set or I could sell tokens for a day and buy it... i could farm gold for 2 weeks to buy my devilsaur or I could sell tokens and buy it in a day. It adds a significant advantage for those who can afford to sell tokens. 
---
Those who want to buy best in slot will do it anyways. Legal or not doesn’t matter. They don’t play for the expirience and they don’t have the morals. 
---
 But atleast in the legal option we will have less inflation making the game better for people who join latter and for people who want to play normally. 
---
It is beautiful, but some of the new models/casting animations would give 9ff a very different feel
---
If you buy a token for money you don't get any gold until somebody buys it from the AH.
---
Somebody has to grind the gold, it doesn't come out of thin air.
---
Chances of there being tokens in classic is 0%, you're an idiot if you think otherwise.
---
People way underestimate how much Ion cares about classic.
---
When the token you bought and put on the AH is sold, YOU get the gold for which it was sold.
---
Maybe **you** are the one who doesn't understand the concept.
---
Were does the gold come from ?
---
Shh! I’m trying to think here!
---
My daughter will soon be 3, if I would play ranged DPS, i could probably create a macro and tell her to push that button until i'm back.
---
Something like:
---
/follow meleeDPS
---
/assist tank
---
/cast rangedspell
---
The demo had an option to toggle between "Classic mode" graphics and updated terrain.
---
Could come from someone who has bought tokens.
---
You see when you post the token to the AH you automatically get the gold instantly, for the listed price at that time.
---
I am in this situation as well, I’ve found a few hours at night are the most I’m able to muster. The wife is very understanding especially with the laptop and couch technique because then at least you are together. Also it allows her to watch shows you are only marginally interested in, while still being near you, so there is some upside for her.
---
So , someone bought the token. So no gold was generated. 
---
While buying from a China farmer who use gold farmed by bots is 100% generated. 
---
Instead of bringing 1000 gold more in the economy , 1000gold only changed hands. 
---
Which is better 1000gold getting added to the economy lowering the value of 1gold or 1000gold just changing hands ?
---
You're right. It was foliage and shaders that were updated, not foliage and textures.
---
Not really no. It's a standalone game and Dev team. And its not like BFA is going anywhere. It won't be the last expansion or anything. Doesn't make retail any less shit though.
---
Well as a new player I read everything I came across i.e quest text and what have you. The story i have encountered is mostly non-existent. my experience has been grinding out mobs then going to a new zone to grind out more mobs. If that does it for you then that's fine with me, and maybe the game opens up story wise after 1000 hours of reading, I'm not much interested in finding out. After 200 hours of meh I've seen enough. 
---
And FYI the defias brotherhood was awesome and easily the point in the game when I was most engaged, I hoped it was going somewhere but then it just stopped after you kill the councilor in stormwind.
---
 Noone isn't a word...
---

I prep and communicate to get \*me\* time. First, I spend time with our kid daily. Help her with homework, play some music/playstation with her and/or take her on small trips, so my wife can relax (fishing / playgrounds / sports etc.). Second, I do meal-prepping every Sunday for the week. I make sure there is easy dinner for a few days during the week. Third, I hate cleaning, but I make sure my wife sees me vacuuming the living room or cleaning the kitchen or something (this is kinda symbolic, caus I hate cleaning). All these activities put time in the bank. Then I talk to my wife and plan the week for family time and \*me\* time. All in all, this gives my a 2-3 sessions during the week and a longer session in the weekend without fuzz.
---
For launch I plan on remodelling a room in our house to an arts and crafts room for my kid and wife, mainly to keep them occupied during the fall and winter ;)

completely new content based on vanilla. But I doubt we will get it. And even if we'll get it, Blizz will likely fuck it up.
---
Lightwell lol. Someone doesn't vanilla.
---
See my last paragraph. I do agree with his sentiment but the way he wrote that one specific paragraph is just absurd and shows an attitude that's simply wrong to hold towards anything.
---
You're right, the whole Industry has seen a drop, along with the whole tech market. However, the drop in Activision-blizzard's stock does have a lot to do with the lack luster performance of the current expansion. The WoW player base is dropping, there are no new IPs on the horizon, diablo 4 is "in the works", they have dropped support for heroes of the storm and have moved Devs away from the game to work on other projects, the overwatch player base is decreasing, and they haven't been able to monetize SC2 as much as they would have liked. 
---
These factors, coupled with the increased pressure on blizzard from Activision to start pushing out more games faster, and cutting costs, mean that they are reaching for the easy fix. Remasters are far easier/cheaper to make vs. entirely new games. As a result, you have all the classics coming back out again for a quick buck. 
---
Blizzard also knows that there is a market for classic WoW. There are multiple private vanilla servers out there, and rumor has that they brought over people when they closed down nostralius to help work on classic. The reason they didn't look at this option after wrath, was because the game wasn't so different from classic. Yes, there were unpopular changes, but the game still resembled vanilla somewhat. Current retail WoW is so far removed from classic, that it is pretty much a different game. That's why they can go back and re-release classic. Because they can capitalize on rose-tinted nostalgia, and also tap a  player base that has left because they don't like retail.
---
The writing is on the wall. There are Multiple articles and videos that talk about the culture shift at blizzard, the high level executives leaving, and an increased influence of Activision over blizzard. The Blizzard we knew is almost gone, and they are turning into just another greedy game corporation. 
---
Get that boy potty trained asap! And find a casual guild that raids weekdays a little later in the evening. After dinner time. It will be easier sacrificing a few hours of sleep during the week than consistently giving up a weekend day with your family. 
---
If people want to get banned for buying gold that’s on them. Not being able to buy gold legally will deter a lot of people. Some people will buy gold but it shouldn’t be easy for them. On my server in vanilla if you admitted to buying gold you were kicked from the guild. At least mine anyways. Buying gold, botting, or basically anything that made the game easier for you illegally was frowned upon. No guild wanted to be the cheater guild. This was my server though. I’m sure a lot didn’t care. I’m pretty sure we won’t have tokens. If you want to buy them do it in retail.
---
I try to ignore these people. If there’s one thing I can all but assure you, it’s that some people are going to be disappointed in Classic. People can’t help themselves but to find something to be upset about and be a vocal minority, whether it’s an introductory sharding, loot trading system, raid release schedule/progressive itemization, AQ war effort quantities, queue dodging or spell batching. There are enough of these topics that people are almost certainly going to be unhappy with Blizzard’s decision on any one of them. I feel like I read apocalyptic posts about all of these topics weekly and many of them have extremely polarizing viewpoints. Frankly, few, if any of them, will likely alter the classic experience in any meaningful way unless you’re on the absolute bleeding edge of raiding or PvP, but it won’t stop people from complaining about them and claiming that the Classic is ruined. 
---
I, for one, am just looking forward to questing my favorite quests from vanilla, the sense of community, doing some raid content and just interacting with the world I used to love. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I’m trying to keep the bigger picture in mind and not get lost in the details. I also think there are much bigger hills to die on, like LFG and WoW tokens, and when all topics are exaggerated to this level they all lose some of their meaning. 
---
Basically this. Especially with games like Pantheon coming up on the horizon, if Blizzard messes up Classic WoW, I will continue on pservers and never look back.
---
Yea, I made the post because I love "vanilla". But I love novelty and exploring as well.  
---
So even though it is highly unlikely, I think the idea of entire new content is interesting. 
---
Story of my life

You must have a really high position in activision to know all this insider informations. Or this stuff is idk your theory with no proof. I rather look at the numbers and see how they are. If activision does not has an increase when all other do. Than we can talk about your theory. Else you just make assumptions 
---
Agreed. I can't wait to kill you out there in the open world, friend.
---
Is corrupted ashbringer any good actually?
---
Vanilla wow has caused many a man to simply abandon their wife, child, and job to maximize more game time.
---
You dont have to be a 5 star chef to know a burnt steak tastes bad.
---
Here is the problem. The economy doesn’t care about your ethics. You can kick them from the guild and do all that. The gold will still enter the economy and reduce the worth of gold or the worth of items. You can’t change that.
---
But the steak isn’t burned. It is still higher than it was years ago. That is a bad comparison since they still are not going into the direction of being at 0. 
---
But it seems you already choose to believe your theory and I won’t try to change your mind. 
---
I used to play on Moon Guard, a RP server, in BFA. There is sharding.
---
Does she have any individual hobbies she enjoys that she can do while you game?
---
The last decade is since activision. 
---
Sharding means a dead game, and it means I'll go back to pservers until Pantheon releases.
---
Dude I think you just want to argue. I don't care enough about your opinion to go searching for the articles I've read to try and prove it to you. Take 10 minutes, do a couple google searches, look at a couple videos and all this information is out there. The youtuber YongYea has a few good videos on the subject.

The mafia is only a problem on pvp servers.

Any server that’s not a pvp server. 
---
&gt; Why not go get those juicy holy talents that improve your healing by crazy high amounts? 
---
Because healing is already covered and him being the Shadow Vuln bitch while also healing can probably same them one healing spot, which can be used for more DPS and faster clears.
---
&gt; So many wasted points in disc. Err..20%  from P for 20 secs on a 3 min countdown?? You get that kind of healing  power increase EASILY from holy. And it’s permanent.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I bet those smal d\*\*\* dps just want PI to look good in meters.
---
They're not really wasted. Vanilla is over 14 years old now, a majority of the people playing still on private servers have done the content for years on different servers. They want fast clears so they can get out of the raid and do whatever they want. Raiding doesn't really hold any challenges left, for many people, and it's easy to the point where people just want to get it over with, or at least fight for quicker clear times, as it's basically one of the last things there's any prestige in.
---
So having PI makes clears quicker and easier, it makes everybody happy.

A bit like an addict looking for that perfect first fix.
---
I will never forget the feeling of my first vanilla play through. It was as good as it will ever get for mmorpgs imo.
---
If there was some sort of garantee of coming even close to that feeling of that first play through, I would vote for new content.
---
Great video. I pretty much agree with your top five. 
---
Cant wait to be rid of the strump supporting edgelords. 
---
There will definitely be bugs, because classic had bugs in it so we will definitely find them again. The main part will be to see how well their port was and finding issues beyonds those bugs because realistically there shouldn't be more bugs than what vanilla ended at. 
---
Eh, saying shit like that is about the same as peeing in the pool.
---
1. kotaku is a bad source and they even state blizzard doesn’t acknowledge what is said in the interview and they don’t give a source.
---
2. the CFO joined 2017 and leaves in 2019 not a big loss 
---
3. they got a full year of payment and we can’t make a clear connection to anything with it since this is a normal practice
---
4. be happy she was the CFO who was talking about cutting corners and save more money. Why is this bad ?
---
5. will watch that one later 
---
I don’t care about that. I care about working for everything I have. So few people bought gold back then. We didn’t have Authenticators. If you bought gold it was likely you would be advertising that gold company a week later cuz you got hacked. Why should we trivialize the game for everyone because some people break the tos and buy gold? I accept people will still buy gold. I don’t want it to be easy for them. So the gold enters the economy? I thought WoW tokens didn’t generate gold? Which is it? The gold illegal farmers sell is the same as tokens. A ton less people buy gold from farmers. 
---
If tokens are in classic it will ruin it. No one should be able to buy anything they want with no effort. 
---
&gt;lack 
---
The problem is that if you can toggle character models, then you never know if someone else sees you the way you see yourself. This would ruin the experience in my opinion, because the whole game is about defining your look with gear that stands for certain achievements. Transmog ruined the game aswell for me. 
---
You don’t understand. Gold farmer generate gold by having bots farm items and vendor it as example. Creating more gold.
---
Tokens just shift money from one player to a different one. 
---
In both cases some people will buy what they want. You can’t stop that. 
---
But i want a classic which lives long and how can it do that with a hyperinflation ? Would you be happy with people having 99.999  gold ? 
---
No.
---
As someone in those expansions.
---
Your dead wrong MoP was hated by people who had no idea of the lore and were upset Blizzard made a Kung Fu Panda expansion even though Monks, and Pandas existed before then AND we already had anthropramorfised animals like Tauren, Orcs, Aarakoa .etc. The only other actual gripe was Daily’s but that got fixed and then the 1 year of SoO.
---
People like a FEW Cata Zones and the reason people want Outland and Northrend like them is because comparitevly they are shit and it’s a pain in the ass to level through them, Cata and MoP were cinematic and kept quests close together TBC and Wrath didn’t. And the shitty squish made those zones worse.
---
No people don’t want Garrisons back, they want the table to be meaningful, I haven’t even bothered with it after week 3.
---
I never heard ANYONE say artifact weapons were bad, I heard people complain about the grind but that became obsolete. And they eventually fixed the legendary issue by letting us buy them with waking essence. But that shit is minuscule compared to the shit storms in BFA and WoD.
---
BFA isn’t just Azerite.
---
It’s grinds with no end.
---
Blatant time hating to run out or subs.
---
Lore making no sense. 
---
Broken servers.
---
Broken Phasing.
---
Broken WPVP.
---
Broken Classes.
---
No communication.
---
Stealth Nerfs.
---
Needing things fans enjoy.
---
Making 3 armor pieces insanely difficult to acquire. 
---
Hear of Azeroth is cancer to the point of raiding guilds just saying Fuck it, get to thirty.
---
4 races locked off.
---
Blizzard didn’t even enable DI or Maghar at release expecting it to take people ages.
---
It will be almost a year before Zandalari and Kultiran races a released. The hype for them has died completely.
---
Nightborne models and animations are broken. No customization options, deleted animation frames causing jumpy animations. I know I complain about same face pre model rework on Fem Troll, but at least they had options. Every NB looks the same except for hair color. 
---
Mythic plus being horribly unbalanced to the point of killing enjoyment.
---
Game breaking bugs that kill Keys in Mythic Plus.
---
Invisible holes in walls and floors in Dungeons and open world. 
---
Scaling horribly broken.
---
Uselessness of non gathering professions.
---
Assaults in BFA give less than a third of legion invasions XP. To the point that they coded legion invasions to give less than a quest once you hit 111. Since XP barely budges in BFA and legion is way more XP and enjoyable.
---
Also EVERYTHING that was in legion is worse.
---
Tables? Worse.
---
Emissary rewards? Worse.
---
Azerite vs Artifacts? Artifacts.
---
Mythic Plus? Worse.
---
Ulduar? Boring.
---
Lore? Worse.
---
Story? God Order Hall questlines shit on BFA alone.
---
You need to sit back take a deep breath and ask yourself that question. 
---
Your entire argument is making improper assumptions about me. Namely that I can’t click loot correctly and that I’m not allowed to share opinions.
---
When you compose an actual argument based on facts or logic let me know. 
---
No, some of the best gear is hidden behind raids so people will still want to do PVE. Also, a PVP server doesnt mean that PVP is all you can do, it just means that you have enabled world pvp in your game :) 
---
I won’t argue with you there. Legion was a lot better than bfa. But a lot of the stuff you accuse bfa of is exaggerated. And azerit armor is a good system. The only weak point is the stacking. But it gets fixed in 8.2 anyway. 
---
&gt;When did they say that they would? 
---
Do they have to announce it, before you expect a beta? I personally think, in 2019, especially for Blizzard products, there's a beta for it, closed and maybe open.  Especially since they have already held a DEMO, where they thanked everybody for participating and for giving them feedback. 
---
&gt; but really I am just expressing a personal concern in the OP because  they aren't saying anything and my trust for Blizzard is at an all time  low. 
---
You're concerned due to lack of communication, when this have always been the case on Classic WoW? - The very same thing that Valve is famous for doing with their products. This is not some 'oddity' from them, but rather standard procedure.
---
&gt; Some of us have waited a very long time for this opportunity, and we all  share the same 'anxiety' that they'll mess it all up, which is why we  want to help. 
---
Pretty sure writing posts like this, is messing up the community up, more than we can fix the game, by letting the beta come to us in due time.
---
No
---
Nothing so I know what I’m getting. Can we sticky this so we stop seeing this question posted ? Of course I’m kidding all love here !
---
Us gamers huh
---
No. None of it is exaggerated. I can litteraly write you a list of every broken mechanic and gamebreaking bug I encountered. Every unusable class in 8.0 and those that are still trash in 8.1 .
---
&gt; Remember when games had significant beta tests done with paid professional QA testers and we got polished final products? 
---
Remember when certain versions of physically shipped games had bugs in them, which differed from what version of the game you had?, PAL, NTSC, PSX, PS2 and so forth games? - Bugs were usually small, because the games themselves were small and easy to test throughout.
---
Good luck paying a handful of QA testers to test games like Classic WoW. 
---
Times have changed, Internal QA testing works, but it doesn't catch all the bugs and it's definitely losing to releasing the games to the masses, which will gladly give you feedback. 
---
Unusable classes. Ironic that you say that in classic wow reddit as if it was negative.
---
Southern Kalimdor Cartel &gt; Un’Goro Mafia 
---
Thankfully i didn't fuck up my life by having kids.
---
&gt; Yes, it exactly imitates what a GM would have had to verify to make it eligible for a loot trade.
---
This sub is so much cancer. 
---
First off that’s not what you initially said. 
---
You spoke about the process in general. Not about mimicking what they would “have to verify”. Surprise. You got caught playing a shitty semantics game. 
---
Secondly even under your bullshit change to try and win an argument you’re completely incorrect. Linking definitions somehow doesn’t make your attempt to conflate the two systems ANY more accurate. 
---
In order to imitate something you have to do it accurately. 
---
So first off the GM process in vanilla was subjective. 
---
There’s no way a standardized process could imitate subjectivity. 
---
Secondly the GM process has access to chat logs and rolls in order to be fair to players. 
---
Does the loot trading process imitate this?
---
Thirdly GMs generally only stepped in on Epic items and many times chose not to get involved. Does the loot trading process “imitate” this. Better yet does it “imitate” this “literally”. 
---
Go learn some English. 
---
There doesn’t HAVE to be a way to handle loot issues at all. That’s your shitty opinion which you are attempting to force upon everyone. 
---
All it does is treat players like children. Maybe immature people like yourself want to be treated like a child but I don’t think the overall philosophy of vanilla matches that kind of immaturity. And certainly I don’t want immature people like yourself ruining the social structure of a game. Go play retail if you can’t handle loot as intended. 
---
Also you’re blocked. Go play semantics games and force opinions on other children. Maybe it will work. 
---
I would like new expansions based on Vanilla. They could learn from past mistakes seeing how vocal the community has always been. 
---
&gt; I don't think bugs in 2019 for a 2006 product is excusable 
---
I don't get this comment, are you that delusional or did you word yourself wrong? - There's a reason why certain Vanilla mechanics and bugs haven't been fixed yet, even on private servers. Just because the game is old, it doesn't mean that it's easy to fix bugs for/in. WoW is 14-15 years old and it's even by today's standard a huge game. The perfect showcase of this would be the main 'backpack' and how they've still not figured out to replace it, even in today's game. Because they're scared of breaking other things, if they alter the code for it.
---
Except blizzard has had over 10 years to get it right and their god damn ineptitude and stupidity is the only reason so many specs and classes are broken.
---
Blizzard doesn’t follow not broken, don’t fix adittude  anymore. They purposefully broke classes in BFA. Classes at the end of legion feel nice. Demonology while feeling better is shit. Hell classes have been getting worse since WoD. Hence why people claim MoP the pinnacle of class design. Where every class was fun and felt op.
---
But nope, had to reinvent the wheel in WoD, Legion and BFA.
---
The solution is to not value WoW so highly. Play what you can. If you can't, it doesn't matter. You have a son and a wife, which is more important that anything the R14 will ever achieve. Cheers
---
BfA is miles worse than WoD or Legion, Legion had SOME fun in it, WoD while stale content wise, still had somewhat fun dungeons and raids. BfA has one shitty raid (ye i know its the beginning but it's been 6 months now, and the raid is SHIT. The next one is coming in over a month so it will be 7 Months from 1st raid til 2nd)
---
&gt;I’ve analyzed the raw data 
---
Note that many of these surveys have been conducted, and sometimes the results are wildly different. Also note that the survey you're looking at, I believe was advertised here in this sub, and this subreddit is probably not representative of the average person who will be playing Classic. This subreddit consists of people who are hanging out to chat about a game fully a year before it exists. That's not the average player. 78% of respondents said they'd be playing on pvp servers. That's not the average player. 72% of respondents were private server players. That's probably not the average player.
---
I disagree, if you plan on tanking dungeons, revenge is one of the most important abilities. It costs 1/3 of the threat of sunder, does more threat, and has a very high uptime. Keep at the highest rank you can.
---
Thanks for explaining the joke. Now I get it because of your help.
---
Hi mate! I am in a similar situation and I believe many of us are. People that played Classic back then are adults now and probably most of us got married, have full-time job, children and only a little of spare time. I have a wife, a 7 months old daughter, full-time job and even some extra job (additional 8 hours a week). Still, I always loved games and I always wanted my wife to understand that's a part of who I am. In order to work, every relationship needs to be built upon mutual understanding and communication. Its obvious that times of carefree playing for as many hours as you want at any time you want are gone for good. The only option here is to talk to your wife and tell her how you feel. You need to ask for some time for yourself, in exchange offering her some time for herself while you take care of your son. You guys need to spend most of the time together as a family because that's the best thing you have AND you need to agree upon some timeslots for your hobbies.
---
That's what we did (me and my family) and it works. We spend 90% percent of after-work time together, yet sparing some time for our hobbies.
---
I hope this helps. Cheers!
---
This. Thank you.
---
Womans wants only a good fuck so keep it up😉 
---
We need a laundry room in each capital with all this talk about sharting
---
Id like to see it tuned harder to account for the talent changes and perhaps even better skilled players, to me its more important to get the feel of vanilla rather than the exact numbers. I want a guilds first rag kill to be meaningful, not a guarantee. If the first days of BWL clears are reduced to stopwatch timers rather than world firsts it wont feel the same imo. Although i'm sure stopwatch boss fights is what well get.
---
They won't fix complex issues found in Beta. They have a set release date and they have plans scheduled for every week until that release date. There's no free time to allocate for something as big as spell batching. Beta test is generally used as a load test and to find a major issues (e.g. server crash) which went unnoticed (unlikely). While they'll track all reported issues and hopefully allocate time to fix those issues in subsequent patches, whether there will be beta or not, won't generally change how classic release looks. If you want polished game, you should wait for a year after release. And everything you've described will be obvious after release.
---
It's not that Blizzard which releases games when they are ready.

They are not scared. It's just a lot of work for something not very important. They could do that, it's all about development time which they consider better spent elsewhere.
---
dude shut the fuck up, it’s evident from that comment that you’ve never had a relationship with a woman
---
I feel that they could add to the Tier 1 - Tier 3 systems adding other gear sets to reinforce alternative specs etc.
---
They have internal authentic vanilla server, so they won't have a problem to validate anything. Now if only we could have access to that server...
---
Some of these seems similar to what I'd personally assume and what I've seen on private servers. Of course the end result might differ, but I'd not expect it to differ that much. Especially when we speak about RP servers which usually feature more involved players.
---
I don't think the vast majority of players are viable testers - look at how many people had an meltdown about not being able to frontstab as a rogue whic was a PS thing.
---
Wow, responding to a 5 month old comment.  :X
---
I really wish Rogues would be as rare as you think, because I would love to roll one, but I just dont think that will be the case.

There is a discord specific for guild finding for classic: [https://discord.gg/d7AZxZA](https://discord.gg/d7AZxZA)
---
There is also a guild recruitment channel on the clasdic wow discord but its not as specific. The other discord allows you to search on region, server type and faction.
---
I never said that.
---
You still clearly avoided the whole bit about the fact that even with QA testers you still had major bugs. And the fact that you could have a relatively small QA team, because games didn't even have 5 or 10% of the content games do nowadays. There's a few exceptions, like Vanilla WoW. But look at that, they had open and closed beta even back then.
---
&gt; They have internal authentic vanilla server, so they won't have a problem to validate anything
---
But then your implying we dont need a beta at all
---
Theres a few discords for it currently.
---
If your looking at an RP-PvP server - then http://pertento.eu/ and if we don't interest you but the a RP-PvP server does then the coalition we are working on with some other guilds might interest you in future.
---
&gt;They are not scared. It's just a lot of work for something not very important. They could do that, it's all about development time which they consider better spent elsewhere.
---
Obviously it's a lot of work, for a fucking bag. But that just further explains the fact that even though the game is old, the bugs can be hard and/or take a long time to fix. Which was my entire point, as to why you can't say "hurr durr the game is old, therefore the game having bugs is inexcusable"
---
some classes not being niche? idk but i’ll play it either way
---
The rules are very simple.  We all agree to them when we start playing.  If someone breaks those rules and enough people (the community) report them, they shouldn't be allowed to play.  It's not that complicated.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, but I just want to point out that the strategy guide is a third party product, officially licensed or not.

I wouldn't worry too much though.  It is healthy in a relationship to have hobbies you don't share.  Just because you are married doesn't mean you have to do everything together.  You already sound very reasonable about it anyway

No dude, listen to him, WoW is declining because people spontaneously don't find MMORPGs fun anymore - because reasons. Also there were no other popular/multiplayer games in 2004. Also none of it has anything to do with the game developers gradually undermining all the game's core systems in a pathetic attempt to chase trends in other genres. Not at all. 
---
Yeah this post makes no sense to me. I don’t see a world where they don’t do Beta and just release...It’s like a given lol.

I smell a retail kid.  I would never want to desecrate Classic with “helpers” and whatever other kind of “tools”.  What’s next? You’re making a “tool” for people to queue for dungeons and raids?  Nahh bra.  I am not looking for insta satisfaction with Classic.  That’s what Retail is for.  Hard work and actually having to read things and use your brain is what makes Classic fun for me.
---
There's a big difference staying in vanilla, but expanding, than moving to BFA. BFA is literally an entire different game. Adding new zones, dungeons/raids whatever to Vanilla, but be centered around the game "vanilla" itself. Level 60 max, slow pace, no mercy kind of gameplay.  
---
Thank you. RP is not for me. But I wish you the best, sounds like a nice project.
---
Thanks! I just registered and will look up what happenens in the next months.
---
What do you not think there is an algorithm to detect if the report system is being abused by a particular player also? It's so simple... 
---
By the time classic comes out he’ll be reliably sleeping through the night. So get in from work, do dinner, play, the bedtime routine and then login for a few hours before sleep. 
---
Give up on getting your wife into games. Let her do her Netflix while you game, you both deserve to unwind with the entertainment of your choosing.
---
They surely can if they want to just like people are free to commit suicide.  
---
Ugh at "A big f to them". The meme is fun as that, a joke, but I really dislike when people take competition to wow so personal.   
---
Competition is good. The MMO genre has not been in a good spot for a while, and having other potentially good MMO's "fail" is not good for anybody, especially when you think of the steady decline with WoW in recent years too (at least post WoTLK). 
---
It means that the genre as a whole is not doing well, and how that is good for anybody I fail to see. If no other big gaming developers won't invest in the development in MMO's in the future because of all the risk involved, it means that we won't get to play any MMO's anymore.  
---
If the time is right and the release gets closer I probably setup a guild myself if it's hard to find the right people. Finding an English speaking guild could be easy, but my vanilla experience includes also the trash talk with my German speaking guild mates. Any Austrians here?
---
Yes we can do that
---
Noone knows.
---
The only official statement we have so far is that there won't be crossover rewards between the 2 games, so the fact you have those on retail won't automatically grants you the same on Classic, same for CE.
---
They haven't said anything about releasing a CE/TCG/whatever for Classic, not yet at least, so we don't know if there will be a way to get those "again" on Classic.
---
There is no real solution for Blizzard putting them into to the game. Letting people use old codes is kinda cheese. They might do something new?
---
You're just making things up, though. They expanded the game and added additional content. They called it The Burning Crusade.
---
Far as I am aware there has never been any official talk of adding "Vanilla flavored content" to the game. 
---
Let it go! Let it go!
---
Only if you'd like to use one of the different side button plates it comes with. I think the new one has an attachment with six buttons in a circle pattern if that's your thing. Also I remember the earlier Nagas had some issues with buttons wearing out/miss clicking but I believe that was fixed with the 2014 version.
---
I see. I don’t think I’ll be able to find that card again :P
---
None. At all. I don’t want any changes. I want patch 1.12 and that’s it. A couple of cosmetic or visual changes wouldn’t be a deal breaker, but if anything touches the game play I’m going to be pissed.
---
Leveling is a marathon that takes weeks for even the most experienced players and months for people who haven't played the game religionsly for half a decade. More often than not there won't be something that indicates that an important quest is available, so you'll only end up avoiding groups, killing mobs for XP and substantially increasing the time it takes for you to reach max level and actually start playing the game.
---
But hey, if you think going in without a plan is gonna be fun, who am I to tell you any different.
---
Play private servers.
---
There will be some enterprising individuals on every server selling these.
---
Is it reasonable to level Skinning/Leatherworking on my way to 60 as a Hunter? 
---
It makes it Pay2Win. Gold has a bigger impact in classic than retail. Also, people are less likely to buy gold if its from some sketchy chinese dude and not literally on the Blizzard website 
---
It doesn’t matter. Aslong as there is a market , even if it is little, they will start generating gold and inflating the market. Iam not talking about a impact in the first months. Iam looking out for the future of classic here.
---
kazzak was a super high populated server, daggerspine was not. Im pretty sure i read some were that there will not be cross realm bgs. Also this was not ment as a solution to the problem, its just what people on those 2 servers used to do.
---
Its actually really interesting imo - Blizzard's original genius when making WoW was to casualize the more hardcore MMORPGs around at that time, to expand the audience. It worked brilliantly, obviously, but they could never find a point where they would go "Ok, the game is now accessible enough for most players, lets focus on strengthening other aspects of the game" They just kept doing what they did originally like a broken machine. The last and only stand in this big long slide was at the beginning of Cataclysm when they folded on heroic dungeons. When they caved I knew at the time it was over and wouldn't stop.  
---
I bought one with a gift card i got for christmas, works great and it's super easy to change the button-sets and button-schemes.       
---
The only issue i have with it so far is that the scroll wheel is really loud when scrolling a lot.        
---
If your old one still works as it should, there's no real reason to get the new one unless you want the interchangeable button sets.
---
Bro I am in the same situation I just told my missus that at the end of summer she's going to lose me for a couple of weeks to relive my childhood.
---
My girlfriend read this and agrees. Thanks for this 😂
---
Wake up early. 30 mins a day to grind consumes / rep or finish a quest adds up over the week.
---
I also have a set agreed time to game with my girl, Friday’s 7-9. And I stick to it religiously, that goes both ways don’t let her keep you from it, and you don’t stay longer than agreed ( just 5 more minutes). At 7:01 don’t talk to me, at 9:01 I log off no matter what. Keeping a consistent schedule works wonders for both parties.
---
I really enjoy these deep dives. I hope you get around to doing shaman and warrior soon!
---
I do agree that Activision is failing Blizzard games and there are many indicators of that, but the stock price is not the most solid argument for it
---
Love the editing and the cartoon ish sounds 😂
---
I hope to see a lot more of this type of content in Classic. Get hype!
---
I was already thinking about it. But I would prefer to re-enter classic without spending to much time in advance, it would reduce my value of rediscovering the old world. 
---
Yeah but you said 
---
&gt;that just sounds extreamly inneficient [...] All that extra work about having spies or having a sacrificial player just seems strange.
---
That's on private servers with massive populations and language barriers. So it's not strange at all. You just take those things for granted.
---
It is true that MoP is widely regarded as the 2nd best expansion. You dislike the dailies but it was worse in both tbc and wrath. Two expansions where they were more or less mandatory for shoulder enchant and attunement for raids. PvP was probably the most balanced it has ever been and ToT and SoO is regarded as some of the best raids to date. 
---
EU/NA?
---
We are based in NA
---
Thank you It means alot!
---
See you there man! Don't be a stranger!
---
When I was feeling lazy but wanted to farm I would go to Blasted Lands and head to the Tainted Scar. You can enslave a level 62 Elite Manahound with like 40k health and just wreck everything you see in the zone. I used to just grind the ogres near by and pick Gromsblood at the same time. Took almost no effort cause the manahound basically 2-3 shots everything. Probably not the most profitable farm but definitely the lowest effort. Just need to keep shards up so you can keep enslaving. 
---
Appreciate that my friend!
---
&gt; But to do any of those things competitively (except maybe "explore", which is a pretty meaningless behaviour in vanilla WoW) you need raid drops. Which requires you to cooperate with other people and fulfil a role. Which means that WoW is not a good game for you to "challenge yourself" by being deliberately bad at group efforts. That is perfectly fine behaviour in single-player games, but weird and selfish in a class/gear-based collective action game.
---
Right. With any kind of group content, there's _tension_ between what a player would like to do, and what the group needs in order to achieve its goals. That tension is resolved by humans reaching consensus, which is a crucial game mechanic in an MMO.
---
It's _your_ belief that certain specs are so bad that no raiding guild should ever want them. I say that depends on the guild. You accuse me of "subjectivism" when, in fact, I'm merely arguing _relativism_.
---
&gt; So thinking that this behaviour ought to be catered to over the desires of people who actually want to play cooperatively is weird.
---
I don't think anything ought to be catered to anybody. I'm saying that there are some aspects of the game design that _you_ don't like, and that other players might actually like those some things. Change the game to suit _your_ preferences and you might be diminishing it for others. You seem to be saying that buffing meme specs will not diminish any aspect of the game for players, since the specs are just plain bad at the moment. That's wrong. Balance druids have a fine kit for PvP.
---
&gt; Word of God is that every spec was intended to be viable, hence every non-viable spec is a failed spec.
---
I suggest you go back and watch the videos from Blizzcon 2015. Kaplan said point blank that Paladins were designed for newer players (and not competitive end game players).
---
&gt; I see you are changing the subject from what would be good game design or sensible behaviour, to what you think Blizzard will actually do.
---
No, I'm not changing the subject. I've stayed on point the whole time. I argued that, in general, meme specs provide replay value in RPGs for some types of players, and that the OP might as well try to discover that replay value. Replay value = more fun. The point of playing is to have fun.
---
&gt; More of this idiotic retreat into wild subjectivism?
---
This is an idiotic sentence.
---
&gt; Do I need to remind you that the topic is specifically PvE raiding, so this constant attempt to drag in other activities is irrelevant?
---
Nope, and that reminder would be in error anyways. Now, do I need to remind you that one solitary aspect of Classic cannot be changed without impacting others?
---
&gt; A raid boss's enrage timer does not care that you are a special snowflake trying ever so hard with your ret paladin or whatever. It only cares how many points of damage you can do before it goes off.
---
I agree.
---
&gt; If you aren't pulling your weight you are bad, and that is a simple mathematical fact.
---
You're not demonstrating that you understand what a "fact" is. Facts cannot prove a subjective interpretation like "bad." And, oh right, there's that word you tried turning against me... "subjective." Subjectivism. Do you see it? Oh, what am I saying, of course not. You're too busy rapid fire quoting my paragraphs and manufacturing contrarian responses. Your attention span isn't anywhere close to where it needs to be in order to understand what I'm saying.
---
&gt; It is not in any way an opinion
---
"Bad" is indeed an opinion. If a raid group includes a ret paladin, and the raid group has fun (whatever that means to the group!), I don't see anything "bad" about the ret paladin being in that group.
---
&gt; The person fixated here is you - fixated on trying to justify getting your particular kicks out of WoW when it is an absolutely terrible game for that purpose, and much better games for that kind of fun are readily available.
---
Everyone playing WoW is trying to get their particular kicks out of it. When you've got a PvPer in your group, they might be only raiding to get gear for the part of the game that _they_ get kicks out of. Balancing individual goals and desires with the group is the social part of an MMO. I don't actually think that part matters to you -- or, at least, it doesn't matter as much as raid progression. That's fine, too. But you look foolish trying to talk about how the game should be redesigned when you cannot acknowledge the full breadth of different kinds of players. Now, you might be tempted to go back to the old "hey, this conversation is _just_ about raiding!" You cannot design (or redesign) a _social_ game like WoW without keeping all types of players in consideration at all times. That's why _you_ are the entitled one.
---
Look and see how utterly dismissive of anyone who doesn't care about raiding as a hybrid DPS. You don't even acknowledge that WoW was a game intended for many different types of players:
---
&gt; Don't play Bridge if you want to show off your miming skills. Miming in Bridge is breaking the rules. Go play charades, which is perfect for what you want.
---
&gt; You are not a special, creative, artistic soul because you want to play a bad spec in WoW.
---
I agree, but _that doesn't matter_.
---
&gt; Nor is anyone else mean or bad or boring or unimaginative for noticing that what you are doing is not hard, not clever, and is actively counterproductive to what everyone else playing the game with you is trying to achieve.
---
There's nothing "hard" or "clever" about most aspects of vanilla WoW. Counterproductive? That's a shortsighted assertion. The point of playing a game is to produce _fun_. Some groups that would have _more_ fun if they allowed everyone to play the spec they want. Others would have _more_ fun if the guild chased world firsts. You are missing the forest for the trees.
---
&gt; It is because there literally is no difference.
---
Uh huh.
---
&gt; These specs have been thoroughly tested, theorycrafted and played by millions of people over many years.
---
So? What does that have to do with anything? What if I don't _want_ theorycrafting to dictate my play?
---
&gt; You aren't "exploring" anything that has not been done before, the reason why these specs are unpopular is just because they are objectively bad and if you take them you are deliberately handicapping yourself (and everyone who lets you in to a raid).
---
They are only a problem for a group if they lower the amount of fun experienced by the group. When that happens, classic offers choices: change your spec, or change your group. Develop some social skills. Find a group of like minded people that aren't slaves to theorycrafting and meta game optimization.
---
Consider that, in order to actually progress, a raid group with a non-traditional comp may have to solve all sorts of unique problems. That given groups the opportunity to face _new_ challenges, and brings _new_ life to encounters that are more easily solved when you approach them in the traditional manner (which is stale!).
---
&gt; More subjectivism? Seriously?
---
Nope, the fact that you think that's subjective makes me suspicious that you don't actually understand the entire social category of game mechanics that make up classic WoW.
---
&gt; There is nothing subjective about doing half the damage a better class/spec would do, or your healing target dying, or you losing aggro on something you were meant to tank.
---
Indeed. All of those things you just described are the _challenges_ that raid groups can face. If the challenges are too few, the content feels cheap and we feel minimal satisfaction when we progress. If they are too many, morale drops and the group risks disbanding. Keep in mind, if they don't buff the encounters, groups that follow the meta game will absolutely experience the former. I am not interested in steamrolling the PvE content, personally.
---
&gt; It's a computer game, not abstract art appreciation.
---
This sentence is devoid of even a nugget of meaning that is relevant.
---
&gt; You don't get marked out of ten for DPS, out of ten for creative spec choice and out of ten for how fashionable your outfit is.
---
Who cares how we get "marked?"
---
&gt; You either do your job or you do not.
---
This is compartmentalized thinking. If the healers do their job, but the tanks don't, the whole group fails. A better way to look at raiding: the group either progresses or it does not.
---
Some people are in the opposite. I don't have high school in the way anymore. I could easily raid every night with my work schedule. Real question is do I want to spend that much time playing this 20 year old video game again? Probably.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Currently I'm looking at one of three classes. Warrior, Rogue or Mage. They are pretty much all I have played since Vanilla on Retail and I'm looking forward to the nostalga of my original journey! - Faction will depend on my Duo partner for leveling. I believe he is tossing up between Shammy and Druid :) - I would prefer Horde however.
---
None, not because I wouldn't want any changes at all, but because they changes I would want would be different from the changes other people want. If I wouldn't be happy with the changes they propose, why should I expect them to be happy with the changes I would want? 
---
The reasoning doesn't matter, but as soon as we start letting a few changes through, we end up letting a lot of changes through, and suddenly we're back to where we started with a game that's completely alien and that no one is really satisfied with even though they got some of their changes. 
---
Then you better not use any addons. 
---
Great info, thanks!
---
You're welcome.
---
Time to farm some game time tokens 😊
---
Don’t know if you’re joking or not. Funny either way. 
---
I understand that. But I'm just saying, they can do some things content wise without adding all the features people disagree with today such as flying mounts and LFR. Just a thought, I'm not married to the idea. 
---
Played Vanilla WoW a lot back in the day. And I see that they're saying that Vanilla WoW will launch in Summer of 2019, but is a beta available now? I'm currently unsubscribed but would re-up if there is an option to play it now. 
---
What the fuck did I just read 
---
I second this advice
---
Lol, continuous insults followed by blocked and I'm the immature one?
---
The GM process wasn't subjective.  The process wasn't available to the public, but it was a cut and dry internal policy.
---
I am not trying to force anything on anyone... I am stating my opinion and why I feel strongly about it.  I have initially said the same thing which is I am not bothered by loot trading, as it mimics what a GM would have allowed and due to how frequent loot issues I understand why Blizzard will have it.  
---
I am also pointing out how no ability to handle loot issues is very NOT vanilla.
---
Maybe not exactly same here (just got needy doggo, not kids), but here are my tips that helped me get more time for my self:
---
* Work from 7 AM to 3 PM instead of 9 to 5, if you can (was biggest change for more, feeling less tired)
---
* Meal prep breakfast and dinner for 3-5 days (second best), never day to day (it's a trap)
---
* Order groceries / cloths etc. online as much as you can: this is something I see unhealthy a lot in nowdays world. People spend shitload of time on shopping distracting themself every day instead of pursuing hobbies they care for.
---
* I was watching Netflix with my SO during evening (like 9-10 PM). We are now watching only during afternoon coffee break (around 6 PM) and it's better and easier to focus. Watching something being asleep is mediocre..
---
Now I got 4h of gaming / tv series time in work days and around 7h on weekend. Also manage to go to gym 2 times a week. It's not just tips for WoW but creating more time for yourself as well cutting bullshit out of it.
---
Remember guys, self-actualization and seeking happiness is highest in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, so manage yourself more happy time with the game you love. :D
---
No, in WotLK you had room for mistakes, in Vanilla you don't really have the same margin (health pool and shit). In theory you could do 5 rotating warriors but they die before.
---
I’ve never seen a game as badly buggy and unfinished as BFA. Most games with closed beta with paid testers do better
---
Oh shit!  I didn't even notice it's classic wow... I just sorted by new and saw a wow post.  
---
Check out the vendor wand level 41 also ;) 
---
Not many wands in the 40s sadly.
---
Uhhh... lvl 30 after doing darkshire, lakeshire and deadmines? That doesn't make any sense. You would be around lvl 20 after doing deadmines, to get to lvl 30 you need to do Duskwood, Redridge, Wetlands, Ashenvale
---
My bad folks.  Classic wow sub.  Selective seeing I guess. 
---
No, Activision will fuck it up 
---
Best I managed with my gf was Lego Harry Potter, and Heroes III. Tried WoW but she gets a headache.
---
Finish Dun Morogh, get lvl 12. Go do the first half of Loch Modan, then go to Westfall. After doing the easier quests in Westfall, bounce between Westfall, Redridge and Loch Modan until you have finished most quests there, then head to Duskwood
---
It's not worth to level any crafting profession while leveling. Only engineering can be useful, due to grenades. I would level skinning+mining/herbalism. If you want to get a crafting profession, its easy to level it up at lvl 60
---
Soooo many people used Questie or Shaguquest on vanilla private servers. Amusingly enough it actually showed me quests I'd either completely forgotten or didn't know existed.
---
As for a group finder kind of thing, I feel like something akin to the current premade group finder wouldn't be terrible. On a Vanilla server, you need to just keep posting and re-posting "LF Healer, SM Cath", but a more 'fire and forget' method where you make a listing and an hour later get what you need could just be better, without sacrificing any kind of community vibes. 
---
People will still post on LFG to increase their chances for a group, and a system for putting your group up on a list for people to check doesn't hurt anything if it's not cross-server. 
---
Whats VC even supposed to mean
---
&gt;  I simply can't understand why people tell warriors to level as fury before 30.
---
Well, what does Arms have? Imp HS is great, but Fury got Unbridled Wrath. Without Cruelty you don't crit enough for Deep Wounds orImpale to do much. Anger Management is nice enough, but if you pull smart you don't need it. That leave Imp Overpower as the reason to pick Arms pre-30. The problem here is it relies on enemies to dodge, thus not that often you get value out of it.
---
Fury on the other hand got Cruelty and Unbridled Wrath. Enrage is also a great dmg boost, though you get it a bit late. Then there is the survival aspect, Blood Craze is great and Piercing Howl is one of the strongest abilities to survive accidental multi pulls or similar situations. One key aspect here is that you get value in most fights from those talents, unlike Imp Overpower.
---
Why though? Just because Classic isn't out yet doesn't mean it can't fail. Especially now that they are screwing up all of their franchises I worry even more that Blizzard will completely fuck up Classic to be honest.
---
We always sed to say that. "the only thing that will kill WoW, is WoW its self"... I just don't think any of us thought it was going to happen THIS way lol, rather than how we expected blizz to implement BFA policies which are killing the game.
---
All this mess is from Blizzard themselves, not from Activision (they do have a role in it though). People love to blame Activision but just look at how many WoW devs keep leaving constantly... Nearly nobody of the original vanilla team still remains nowadays. All the people who designed the great systems in vanilla, BC and WOTLK are all gone and are replaced with the same people who made WoD.
---
Nope. You are obviously missing some quests if you need to do anything more than I described. I have done this literally dozens of times on realms we are not allowed to name. 
---
If you follow my steps you will be:
---
Lvl 5 leaving noob area 
---
Lvl 7 arrive in elwyn (can also do noob area here
---
Lvl 12 move to west fall for all quest
---
Lvl 18-19 is deadlines
---
Should be now alternating lakeshore and duskwood until all quests are complete which will make you 30 if you run stockades with all quests except the dwarf based one from wetlands 
---
I am not joking when I say I have levelled over fifty characters to cap on alliance 
---
In a worst case scenario you will be lvl 28, so take the walk I suggested and do the quarry quests in wetlands and the Murlock ones near town and you will be back on track 
---
Get this anime shit out of here imo there’s no weeboos in Classic.
---
I fear what you say is true. I'm beginning to doubt my own argument now. The sad reality is that companies can make way more on mobile games and micro-transactions, so why would a company (especially like Activision) put effort into making a quality pc game, or really care much about subscriber numbers when they are making the lion's share on micro-transactions.
---
Hopefully they'll keep classic pure, and let us have that. In any case, Blizzard is dead to me now.  
---
&gt; You're just making things up, though. They expanded the game and added additional content. They called it The Burning Crusade.
---
So you can't see the difference between 10 levels, new talents, skills + 100 core changes to the game, vs adding Maraudon, Dire Maul, Black Wing Lair, Zul'Gurub, Dragons of Nightmare, Ahn'Qiraj, Naxxramas.  
---
Literally everything in version 1 vs everything in version 2 of WoW, when we talk patches and logs.  
---
What are your thoughts on inner fire? Is the 420~ armor worth it for PVP? I would think so
---
This is what I do. I bought a proper gaming laptop and now I just play from the couch, often with the TV on in the background. I was very negative toward laptops for years because of how expensive they were, but this is far more cozy and social. 
---
This is a level beyond twinking
---
The TCG is not printed anymore, so new codes will not happen.
---
The answer to this question is always the same and it's a lot more complicated than just finding time to play wow. It's great if you and your wife share hobbies, but it's also okay for you to have your own things. I play bass. My wife does calligraphy. It would be really weird if we had to be sharing our hobbies all the time, and kind of pathetic if I only did what she wanted all the time.
---
Check out the #Guild_Recruitment channel on our discord, [discord.gg/classicwow](http://discord.gg/classicwow), or wait until the (Monday?) sticky thread. 
---
he meant F as in to pay respects, not as in fuck you.
---
Very cool
---
I think rolling rogue on any PvE server is a safe bet. On PvP, however, things might be different.
---
Oh yeah, didn’t think of the meme/reference with the small “f”, but you are probably right, I corrected my reply. 
---
Mount your PC on a treadmill and make a rule, where you can only play as long as you're at least moving at walking speed on the treadmill.
---
Love the idea of a different playstyle, and even if it isn't optimal it might be more fun for you, which is an important factor.
---
With that said, I did some quick math. I'll take a look at level 24, since you get a new Heroic Strike at that level and got a new Sunder Armor rank at level 22. It's also pre-30 where you get arms get Sweeping Strikes which is really strong.
---
First let's look at Rend. It will deal more damage as Heroic Strike and cost less rage. If the enemy lives long enough for the damage it is indeed great to use.
---
Now, Sunder Armor. I'll assume your tactic of rage from previous mob is in play. Each stack will approximately increase the damage your foe takes by 5%. Since you start with Rend you won't get it for your first hit. With a GCD of 1.5 it now depends on weapon speed. If it is a slow weapon you can get 2 stacks before next AA, if not you might only get 1 stack.
---
At level 24 you will probably hit around 80 with a 2h. At 4 stacks that means each attack gets +4 damage. One Heroic Strike does 44 bonus damage, so a total of 176 damage. With 4 stacks of Sunder Armor you will need 44 AA before you equal that damage. That means your foe needs over 3520 health before it is worth it (and that's being generous with the math, since you need to reapply a few times).
---
Now, I have ignored Improved Sunder Armor since a different spec would use Improved Heroic Strike or have other dmg increases from Fury.
---
As you can see, Heroic Strike is far superior to use, in which case the prot build is also a loss in damage.
---
Again, great to see new builds, but just doing some math for you to look at when deciding what to play.
---
Change it to “run a mile” instead of doing sit-ups etc and you might actually see results from this. You need to do compound exercises if you want to burn fat and calories. While a nice idea in theory, this will never work. Health and fitness and a long game where consistency and determination are key — if you need to “disguise” it as punishment for negative things happening in a video game, your head isn’t in the right place and you don’t actually care about being healthy and fit.
---
If you want to be healthy and fit, you just have to do it, and not try to skirt around it or trick your brain or whatever. It’s the only way.
---
They really did an awesome job with Ashbringer in Legion.

So where did the non chinese farmer players get gold? That’s right they farmed it! Players add gold to the economy every time they vendor an item. Our gold doesn’t just stay at a static amount the whole time. I can get gold the same way the farmers do by putting in the time and effort. It doesn’t hyper inflate when people have to work fir their gold. If people could just buy gold with tokens then i can charge what i want for an item. You forget people must farm gold to buy the tokens. They don’t just randomly have it. If they spend their gold on a token where do they get gold for the next one? All I see from your argument is that you seem to think there is a static amount of gold. If people don’t have enough gold for a token how do they get more to buy it? They go farm more! So yeah I guess a token can add gold huh?
---
This! You absolutely have to maximize intimacy with her, not time wise but quality wise. If you daily give her intimacy, foot rubs, back massage, go down on her, etc. Bring her flowers home from work, give her an hour cuddle time while watching netflix. If you maximize the quality of intimacy, (which is what women really want), then you can have some time for yourself. 
---
But the reality is that you simply cannot play WoW like you did back in the day. I don't know about you but I was addicted to the game, I worked full time but played like 6 hours every evening after work and all the time on the weekend. Those days are over for us my friend. 
---
&gt; I'd not expect it to differ that much
---
I think it might. For example, I'm guessing there won't be nearly as many dwarf priests as these surveys suggest, simply because only people who are already part of "the scene" would know that it matters. Warriors will probably not be nearly as popular among players who don't already know how good they are. Current retail players moving to Classic will probably play druids and paladins in much larger proportions. There are probably lots of cases like this. How many people are going to make character planning to play prot paladins and balance druids simply because they don't know how these classes play in vanilla? And not all of those people will ragequit when they find out.
---
Ramp it up much faster. Start off at 15, then 30, then one hour, then 3 hours, then 24 hours, then one week. At the end of each week, reset it to one level below where they're currently at, e.g. if they're at a 24 hour penalty it goes down to the three hour penalty if they desert again.

&gt; aggressively healthy [...] A raw vegetable w/o any dip, celery stick, carrot etc.
---
Uh you mean "food?" So you're literally threatening yourself with having to eat vegetables as a 'punishment' for dying in a video game, have I got that straight?
---
LPT: you shouldn't need to incentivize eating healthy foods. All that does is help you justify eating garbage the rest of the time your not 'punishing' yourself.
---
ROFL, yeah I love throwing my big CoC around. 
---
I would say it depends on whether Blizz will want to use server mergers and/or sharding.
---
With sharding you wouldn't need that many servers. Without, there would have to be significant more servers at launch that then would be merged once the tourists quit playing.
---
You got an item in Vanilla / Retail.
---
This is Classic.
---
Different games.
---
eh that sucks if you have a disconnect though.
---
I've wondered the same thing.
---
Give me wotlk with the story telling and cut scenes of now.
---
God you seem fun at party’s.
---
Your mouse is better imo.  The new ones don't have the two index finger buttons anymore, so now I buy Logitech.
---
There's also nothing wrong with it.
---
That subreddit is bad for different reasons. This subreddit is just as cancerous.
---
is it possible to autoloot when pickpocketing?
---
Maybe if you grind quite a bit in between the quests.
---
That's my plan, but I can't really unlearn what I've learnt. 
---
Sounds like a welcome addition to me!
---
No grinding required. You just need to do all the quests. 
---
The sad thing is that they don't really care if subscriber numbers are going down. They make most of their money on micro-transactions and mobile games is the future for them. The company is run by the marketing and sales departments. 
---
It does have some sort of gameplay consequence though. That was why I brought it up.
---
* Auto-dismount when you cast spell
---
* AoE Looting
---
* 2.0 Character stats (show spell damage/hit in character pane)
---
* Shared group questing items
---
* Dynamic respawns
---
* 25g Respec or 500g purchasable dual spec system  
---
You should use whatever spec you find most enjoyable to level in. Stop dictating how people enjoy a game. 
---
Imo don't increase progression any more vertically, instead offer more horizontal with sidegrade items and maybe things that could make more specs viable.
---
You show data and then make assumptions about the cause. The actually cause is that companies seem to get corrupted by focusing on profit alone. And what ends up happening is that the marketing and sales people come into power and end up running the company and making decisions. 
---
Subscriber numbers will always fluctuate. I played WoW from the beginning, but would unsub for periods because of life changes, and then come back for a year or two and then leave and come back. But I did not leave because I did not enjoy the game. I finally left for good during Cata because the game stopped being enjoyable for me. 
---
To put it simply, around the time of Cata the company stopped becoming a gaming studio and became a business run by the marketing and sales department. And when that happened the game lost it's appeal to the people who actually play the game.  
---
As many as they need. Which probably means somewhere around 30-50.
---
&gt;Embriel
---
Beautifully written, thank you for the input!
---
By the way, what do you think of the upcoming WoW:Classic ? What do you expect the gamers will recieve ?
---
I'm building a guild. Very concisely:
---
* No rush, no (forced) guides.
---
* Progression.
---
* EU, PvE.
---
If you (or anyone else) is interested, just PM me.
---
All Oralius text was good
---
NaM !
---
Enough. 
---
It's just to craft them unlike the mithril spurs item (which you can still use on someone's boot piece for them to use, like an enchant is applied).
---
So this isn't Classic related entirely. But I had never played Old School Runescape going up and I hadn't started playing WoW until Wrath (I quit in the middle of Legion because I got bored), I just started playing Old School Runescape for the first time and I didn't realize how much I missed the satisfaction of old school game design. It takes so long to do everything, but it feels so much more fun along the way, less mindless in a way. I am excited to try out Classic because of that, and I imagine at least a few other people will find joy in that kind of challenge again as well who've never played the game, or missed their chance growing up. 
---
This.
---
I believe they are also hoping that the influx of people who subscribe for classic will give retail a try.  At that point it doesn't matter to them what version they play as long as they are in the ecosystem.
---
It will just be as much work, at least. They’ll have to do all the same work they’re doing now with vanilla to make it compatible with the modern engine and infrastructure. 
---
9ff? I get some people don’t like change, but honestly I love the new models. 
---
Attention all Blizzard Gamers!
---
Yeah, if someone else’s client side graphics makes the game unplayable for you you gotta reevaluate your priorities 
---
Haha hey if it’s open to comment it’s fair game. Came across it in a search then didn’t realize it was old commenting on the dumbassery if his comment :P
---
The horizontal &gt; vertical progression is bullseye.  
---
Yeah I’m coming to realize that when scrolling down beyond the top comments. Straight circlejerk bullshit like /r/wow, it sucks 
---
Pretty much.
---
Priest is always shadow  
---
Rogue is always combat swords  
---
Lock is afflic (with imp VW)  
---
Pally is ret  
---
I love this project, and I love the improvements. Keep it up!
---
Maybe the original devs left because of Activision's shittiness?
---
Im in. 
---
Warrior - generally yes, but no more /sit pserver meta will work, so I guess arms will have the edge. Protection gets decent around lvl50 and you will feel the difference while tanking dungeons  (although you still can tank in any other spec).
---
Priest - Leveling in disc (with only spirit tap) is probably better than shadow until shadow form. 
---
Rogue - I would suggest combat at least until lvl30, after this other specs can offer nice stuff too. 
---
Mage - Leveling in fire is actually fun, aka glass cannon - mobs die before then even reach you. But your PVP performance won't shine that much and you'll spend more time drinking. Arcane is a support/meme spec, although Arcane Missile leveling is doable but suboptimal in most occasions.
---
A friend of mine leveled in MM and his response was generally positive, more hunter damage and Scatter Shot are nice. But still next time he would pick BM over it. Survival is a meme spec to derp around in PVP, packing a nasty surprise for the melees. 
---
Lock - pretty much every spec but full destro, destro would probably do the most damage but survivability and mana are the issue.
---
Druid - Around ~35lvl there are quite a few funky +arcane damage items you could use, a surprise starfire crit hurts a damn lot. Balance damage if fine but mana efficiency is bad straight ahead and you can't compensate it like fire mage with free drinks. 
---
Shaman - Elemental Zap-zap is fun but once again it's mana being the issue. 
---
Pally - Ret is the most common way, however if you want to tank dungeons you have to dive for a bit into holy for consecration. After lvl40 protection becomes a decent /afk grinding spec. Throw a judgement and a seal on you and then autoattack the mob to death for a minute while watching your favorite videos.
---
Since vanilla didn't have a deserter debuff, the primary consideration should be to make the change as unobtrusive as possible, while still serving as an effective deterrent.
---
They're both World of Warcraft. Or did the Mukla card specify "Vanilla/Retail"?
---
Impeccable editing
---
A lot of people like games and don't spend hours every day arguing over worthless benign shit to validate their interests to random people online. The way you're acting is what's pathetic &amp; embarrassing
---
SM DS is litterly the prefered solo questing spec...
---
Full on destruction would be the better choice for your question.
---
note for rogue: second it. combat is most effectice, but as soon as hemo is available you can also level with sub. (i will do that)
---
Uh, I mean no. Sorry.
---
I enjoy leveling in a reasonable time, IDGAF how I get there. So this is 100% relevant to my interests.
---
I think you overestimate how many "noobs" we will get. Even people that currently don't think of joining classic might do some research. There are tons of videos like "what class to play in classic?" and while not all of them are exactly correct, they still provide some general idea. People relatively new to WoW might not have a clue about classic, but even they I think will watch a video or two.
---
Also, I believe that most really new players will quit, not because they've learned that their balance druid is not really a raid spec, but because they came to Classic to simply check it out and will quit in 10 hours due to lack of QoL. I think the "raiding spectrum" of players will be mostly formed by diehard fans.
---
I see your point and it mostly advocates for popular classes which will supposedly be underrepresented compared to demand there is for them. However, don't expect new players to have too large impact on the raiding scene. Balance druid # 138 is not realistically going to take raid spot from that Druid guy who planned his build 2 years before release.
---
&gt;As a hunter who's leveled by Marks and Beast, Marks is more fun, Beast is faster and easier to grind with.  It also makes kiting PvP much easier thanks to the big red pet.
---
I've leveled marks. It's more fun than beast master, but without a souce of free drinks it's just not worth it.
---
&gt;Pally - Ret is the most common way, however if you want to tank dungeons you have to dive for a bit into holy for consecration. After lvl40 protection becomes a decent /afk grinding spec. Throw a judgement and a seal on you and then autoattack the mob to death for a minute while watching your favorite videos.
---
If you're going to level prot, then you need to pull multiple mobs at the same time and put up mana and HP judgements on mobs to reduce downtime to zero why they beat themselves to death on you.    You have to do a lot of active pulling, judgements, etc to stay alive.  It's not an AFK spec, that's RET.  The spec really shines once you make to zones that you can AOE farm, like the farms in Athrai and WPL grave yard.  I can confim that it's slower than ret.
---
Its nice that someone in the alliance (other than Genn, i guess?  Well, and Varian, but he got disintegrated) finally said 'fuck the warmongering horde thats constantly attacking' and is actually willing to fight back.
---
Also nice that Tyrande is doing that now, as well.
---
Starting slow is important when getting back into shape, if I tried to put myself through running 5 miles today I'd have zero motivation to continue tomorrow. (Notice how I said "a set" rather than a specific amount? A set is whatever makes sense to the person doing this.)
---
There's also the fact that daily exercise and diet is hardest for the first few days, once you get over that hump committing to continuing gets a lot easier.
---
Also, I wouldn't call it a punishment really. Dying and running away while playing a warrior are inevitabilities, so committing to it this plan IS a commitment to diet and exercise. 
---
It also (third "also") seems you haven't considered the possibility that my main goal might be to learn to play WoW more intelligently.  :D
---
5.0 miles ≈ 8.0 kilometres ^(1 mile ≈ 1.6km)
---
No progress report yet btw. Still a few hours away probably.
---
I always level fury and never used the /sit exploit.
---
Enrage and blood craze still proc quite often and can be very useful.
---
You will benefit more from arms though if you're on a pvp server.
---
There were bug fixes in the pre TBC patch that no one ever talks about. Like ISB being resistable for example. I am wondering if it will be un its pre 2.0.1 state or 1.12 state for example.
---
From a business point of view, probably as many as possible (to indirectly promote server transfers later on).
---
That's the biggest risk I guess... ending up on one of the half-dead realms because many players left after being disenchanted by the roughness of Vanilla.
---
I think RP realms are the most secure in this regard, but who knows.
---
Warrior: Arms and Fury perform similarly. Fury will outperform arms unless making good use of sweeping strikes, but the difference isn't very big. Prot is complete trash and not necessary for tanking dungeons before 60 either (not even at 60 really, but helps before you have gear).
---
Priest: Holy except for with 5/5 Wand Spec, 5/5 Spirit Tap, and 2/2 Improved Shadow Word Pain is actually optimal for leveling before level 45. I explained why in my [priest leveling guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/).
---
Rogue: Combat. Other specs are significantly worse.
---
Mage: Frost is significantly better than Fire. Arcane is trash.
---
Hunter: Beastmaster is a ton better than Marksman. Survival is trash.
---
Warlock: Unlike every other class I haven't played warlock in vanilla. Not qualified to speak.
---
Druid: Feral. Resto and Balance are trash. You can go up to Omen of Clarity/Improved Thorns in Balance and/or Furor in Resto without losing too much effectiveness, but putting all points in Feral until level 40 is still better.
---
Shaman: Enhancement. Resto is trash. Elemental is bad until level 40, at which point it gets decent thanks to 5/5 Lightning Mastery, but enhancement is still better.
---
Paladin: Ret. Holy is trash but you need 11 points for Consecrate if you want to tank. If sit to get crit and proc reckoning works in classic then prot will be better at 35+ for people willing to /sit every mob auto attack, otherwise prot is bad.
---
Ret is not nearly as afkish as as single-target prot spec when you gain a lot of armor with your shield and maximum profit from judgements with quick 1hander. 
---
Pally AoE is mostly lvl60 spec, never seen it being used for leveling unless you massively outlevel your enemies.
---
I have used both and have no issues with either. I'd happily still use the old version.
---
If you're planning on tanking, get Consec first. You can get it at 20 and from that point onwards you're sorted.
---
There's no point JUST going for Pursuit of Justice in Ret - if you're going that far then just get Seal of Command and level as Ret, then go get Consec later and just heal or dps your first few instances.
---
It was pretty darn good actually.
---
I would guess not that many since they will likely want active servers and cross-server play isn't going to be a thing.
---
For NA only, if there are three server regions like back in the day, I'm guessing 5 or 6 per region.
---
It's probably something their currently debating since it's tough to predict how many people will be playing past the first few weeks.
---
Guild banks, rework honor system, more (and dynamic timers) black lotus spawn locations, lower respec cost
---
Well, if you change this, then you should change that, and that, oh by the way that thing sucks too, etc, etc. 
---
\#nochanges is what it is, vanilla has flaws, and those flaws should be managed by the server community INCLUDING server's GM: ungoro mafia, dodging, loot trading you name it
---
Call JG Warcraft! 877-RAID-NOW
---
Then reduce the distance to something manageable but scale it reasonably. If you can do a quarter mile around the block to start then that would still be beneficial.
---
&gt; God you seem fun at party’s
---
The irony of this statement is that anyone who'd say it is probably not fun at parties. Or as you say, "party's."
---
my turn to post it tomorrow
---
I hope this becomes a Winter 2017 meme.
---
It's been summer 2019 for 7 days now, where's my classic damnit?
---
Wrong Jaina
---
Unlikely.
---
Following your advice, think Imp. BoW would be worth it at that point?
---
My friend used to do sets of pull-ups between BG queues. He was an otherwise healthy and reasonably fit person due to being in the military but was looking for an excuse to justify gaming for hours.
---
The diet amendments seem weird to me. If you want to eat more vegetables as small snacks then set a reminder on your phone to do so. Maybe every couple of hours. I agree with the others thought that it doesn’t show a healthy relationship with food.
---
I spend a fair bit of time playing more active games in VR which has pushed my TDEE up at least a thousand calories most days when I play a lot. That time would be more efficiently served working out for an hour or two more, but this method is more enjoyable to me.
---
If you want to feel better for being lazy and spending your whole day in a computer chair, it MAY be best served by doing periodic and regular exercise. Set up a standing desk with a treadmill and only play on that. Set an in game timer to do push-ups or planks or something every 20 minutes regardless of any chosen punishment. After a short acclimation period the distraction will help you focus on your time playing.
---
Gamification of your nutrition feels like a problematic approach.
---
I prefer that those threads would disappear. New content without reason for it (higher item levels,or simply better balanced as in stats) won't make sense, and if blizz puts it in, it will gradually make most of the game irrelevant. Just make a "museum" and leave it alone.
---
Also entirely new developers( current blizzard) can't in any way replicate the vision of the old team. And this isn't a matter of whether the old was good or not.
---
That "vanilla+ content" only sounds good in people's minds, but it cannot be implemented without making the rest irrelevant. Major problem of old (depends on your point of view) was that gear often made no sense and was big reason of why there were under performing specs, how do you add items that suck just the same and aren't good enough to remove any reason to visit old content? Part of vanilla and in fact a BIG part of it, was that there were loads of items that were BIS or close, yet were dropped from old dungeons or crafting. You simply can't add content to classic, the amount of dedication and balance to keep it in check would be immense.
---
Naw
---
&gt;Pally AoE is mostly lvl60 spec, never seen it being used for leveling unless you massively outlevel your enemies.
---
I did it just fine.  
---
How would you rate the Logitech vs the older nagas?
---
I am gonna either go shadow priest or arms warrior myself, irregardless of how good or popular they are.
---
Hard to say. They'll probably try to give us 1.12 as good as they can but cost cutting will probably have a higher priority. Things like limited sharding and loot trading are examples of this.
---
I think it will be a great product for 99% of interested players but those too accustomed to private server meta, changes, content roll out and numbers approximations will probably not enjoy it. 
---
I miss giving people drive by buffs. It gave a small sense of helping out and a closer community. I have a hard time understanding why they have done away with it in retail.
---
yes
---
Van Cleef
---
Trying to figure out if my work laptop is going to run classic. Only thing I’m concerned about (I think) is the integrated graphics chip. 
---
Any help is appreciated!
---
Here are some specs:
---
- Lenovo ThinkPad 
---
- Windows 10 pro
---
- Intel Core i5-6300U @ 2.4GHz, dual core
---
- 20GB RAM
---
- Intel HD Graphics 520
---
Let me know if you anything else is helpful to know! Thanks!
---
What about collectors edition mini diablo?
---
I had that pet from day one in vanilla, it says it is available to all characters on my Warcraft account, and my Warcraft account will include Classic, at least as far as my payments go.
---
I guess it could go either way.
---
Of course I won’t. Addons ruin the experience for me
---
Change PvP system to long grind that doesn't have such harsh decay. Something more along the lines of reputation grinding.
---
Exactly, to each his own.  I will not be using whatever you’re making or any addons in general as imo all that does I’m dumb down and simplify the gameplay.   But have fun, I’m sure bunch of people will enjoy it.
---
Awesome thank 
---
Hi, /u/drgreed
---
Nicely produced
---
I'd say just hit 60 and start running dungeons. You will meet a lot of people and if you can hold your own you won't have a problem finding a guild. Everything that is being formed before launch is just hypothetical at this point.
---
What is macroeconomics and how does it effect stock prices?  Try that in google chump.
---
&gt; I love to see how many players aren't currently subbed to WoW
---
7392 out 10176 say no, so:
---
 * 72.6% are not currently subscribed
---
 * 27.4% are currently subscribed
---
Related, 5090 out of 10176 have played Battle for Azeroth, so:
---
 * 50% have played the most recent expansion
---
 * 50% have not
---
Which implies that almost half of respondents who have at least tried BfA, have cancelled.
---
&gt;KEK at the ones who answered "under one week" to go from 1 to 60. That would be possible with speedrun tactics, tons of gold and competent high-level friends, but on launch? Forget it, even if you play 10-15 hours a day.
---
Only 170 made that claim, roughly 1.6%. That's not a large portion. Not to say that they'll all succeed, but that 1-2% of the people here in this sub are going to binge 20 hours straight on day one, grinding mobs for 4-5 hours at a time if they can't find quests, then sleep for 6 hours and do it all over again...it seems plausible to me. Sure, probably a fair number of them will miss the target or crash and burn on lack of sleep, and end up at 8-9 days instead, but I think it's not an unreasonable claim.
---
Meanwhile:
---
 * 170 (1.6%) say 1 week
---
 * 982 (9.6%) said 1-2 weeks
---
 * 2089 (20.5%) say 2-4 weeks
---
 * 3408 (33.5%) say 1-2 months
---
 * 2258, (22.1%) say 2-4 months
---
 * 865 (8.5%) say 4-6 months
---
 * 398 (3.9%) say 6 months or more
---
Ok, so there are two ways I can answer this. 
---
For reference, I've leveled several Paladins specs on pservers and am currently helping YouTuber CaffeineInjected with his Protection Paladin run.
---
So. There's a wishful thinking build and then there's the cold hard reality build.
---
Wishful thinking is that you're going to be tanking. You're not. You might get a chance to tank maybe one or two incredibly low-level instances because you manage to PuG some pretty dumb players, but the fact it you'll be asked to heal, and if you can't heal you'll be kicked—except for that rare occasion where you'll be *allowed* to DPS (though your DPS is going to be so low you might as well be a Searing Totem.)
---
If you absolutely must ruin your first playthrough by leveling a memespec, then you can't put any points in Ret first. You *have* to get Divine Intellect + Divine Strength and then the eleventh point in Consecration. Just keep in mind that Consecration will use up all your mana in two casts.
---
This is the earliest you can get Consecration to tank and it's the only time it's really worth it while leveling because past level 30 you won't be able to reliably trick / convince players to let you ~~wipe for three hours on the same dungeon~~ tank.
---
After getting Consecration you *could* go into Ret, but Ret + Cons is pretty inefficient without all the Protection defensive skills to protect you while getting slammed by 5+ mobs. 
---
If you're going Ret (which you should, because it's the most efficient) you're going to want to respec and get Reckoning at around level 32. So ideally you should never be dipping into the Holy tree at all.
---
You absolutely don't need Imp BoW to level. That is exclusively a raiding talent (maths-wise.)
---
If you want the most efficient leveling build, here it is:
---
10 Benediction
---
11 Benediction
---
12 Benediction
---
13 Benediction
---
14 Benediction
---
15 Improved Judgement
---
16 Improved Judgement
---
17 Deflection
---
18 Deflection
---
19 Deflection
---
20 Seal of Command
---
21 Pursuit of Justice
---
22 Pursuit of Justice
---
23 Conviction
---
24 Conviction
---
25 Conviction
---
26 Conviction
---
27 Conviction
---
28 Deflection
---
29 Deflection
---
30 Sanctity Aura
---
31 Two-handed Weapon Specialization
---
At this point you respec to get both Seal of Command *and* Reckoning in the Protection tree.
---
Also, your main source of damage is going to be your two-hander, so do Deadmines enough to get Smite's Mighty Hammer, then get Verigan's Fist (level-20 class quest) and that'll take you all the way to 30. There are guides online that'll tell you which two-handers to get next.
---
Thats recent, some of us have been playing blizzard games for almost a quarter of a century. 
---
Overeating is counterproductive even if it is the healthiest of foods.
---
We had a ret paladin in Naxx. I guess since the enemies are undead he was allowed to give it a whirl. We only got about 3 bosses down before TBC pre-patch.
---
I remember him doing more dps than most of the hunters.
---
I had completely forgotten about it until deciding to roll on a vanilla server. It really does feel like you’re wishing the best for your fellow faction members and it feels great to be on the receiving end as well.
---
Yes, I can see the difference between Vanilla and NotVanilla.
---
I'm not the one trying to bring NotVanilla into Vanilla
---
Appreciate it! I’m trying to step up my quality little by little.
---
A Ryzen 3 and an rx570 4gb would probably be the bare minimum for 1080p 60fps on high. 
---
A Ryzen 5 and an rx580 8gb would be better, right on par with your suggested i5 and 1060.
---
I went with a G502 Hero so it's not even the same keypad style.  But I will say it has a nicer build quality and Logitech products run a little cheaper usually.  They do make a keypad mouse a friend of mine uses it.  He seems to love it but I suggest you walk into Best Buy or something and try one out.
---
&gt; Here is the problem. 
---
Not a problem. You spontaneously generated the problem from your own imagination.
---
&gt;The economy doesn’t care about your ethics. 
---
And yet, somehow (magic eightball?) Blizzard does/did.
---
&gt;You can kick them from the guild and do all that. 
---
Good. Glad for your Royal Permission to do that. Sheesh.
---
&gt;The gold will still enter the economy and reduce the worth of gold or the worth of items. 
---
Again, you don't know that. Because when we, the players, voluntarily DO NOT PARTICIPATE in illicit gold traffic, then we're playing by the rules of the *GAME*
---
&gt;You can’t change that.    
---
Hyperbole and nonsense. Because even if *you* don't believe we have power as the player(s), we actually *DO*. By not participating. By holding up standards amongst ourselves as groups, too.   
---
Spare everyone your fear-mongering motivational speeches. Tokens are not needed nor are necessary.
---
6 gen i5 dual should be fairly reasonable. [Download retail and play](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/start) (free to 20) and see how it runs.
---
I leveled several characters to 80 during wrath and on private servers. It's probably my favorite expansion with MoP coming second. MoP had WAAAAAY worse dailies. If you just buy Relics of Ulduar, you don't even have to do the dailies in wotlk. I never did. You could wear also tabards that got you to exalted with most of the end game factions, giving you access to mounts, gear, and recipes. Dailies were there, but they could be entirely ignored. It's been a while since I played MoP, but I felt forced to do dailies the whole time I played it. If I wanted exalted status, mounts, gear, or to level professions like cooking, I was stuck doing dailies in MoP. I actually think MoP is fine as an expansion, but wrath dailies could be avoided entirely.
---
&gt; It doesn’t matter. 
---
Oh, it matters. Just NOT to *YOU*.    
---
What you want (and what Blizz did to retail, no less) is snapped a Game Genie/Game Shark device on to world of warcraft and unlocked shit that made the game easy-mode and UNFUN.
---
Game Genies accomplish nothing. You don't play the game with cheat codes. You bypass content and some of the grind.
---
&gt; There won't be any patches? It's called 1.12.1 for a reason.
---
Wasn't the demo already 1.13?
---
Yup. Angry super Jaina is the best thing to come out if BfA. Fuck peace treaties that the horde will break, kill em all.
---
But was it even ever in? 
---
That really depends on what you stream honestly. As a variety streamer that may be true.
---
But I for example have seen speedrunners that started with 0 and had 200 viewers after a month or two just because they were successfull.
---
Probably only if you're then going full Holy. 
---
By the time you get enough points to be able to afford more than just Seal of Command + Consecration, you're going to have to pick a spec to aim for really. The spec that leaps out from that combo is the 21/0/30 spec, which is basically full Ret but with enough healer power to be able to heal raids. You only miss 5% crit and imp BoW compared to a full Holy, as Holy shock isnt all that great.
---
getting 30 in Ret is much better for levelling really. You can still use BoW and dont need to improve it to get good use out of it. You'll likely level a lot faster as 30 ret with non-imp BoW than trying to use a two hander as a near pure holydin. Imp BoW just requires far too much investment into Holy to make it worth it unless you're going to go pure Holy.
---
The majority of people in the mafias are EU
---
Cheating is a problem, it being available to jobless players isn't. It's available to people who are willing to put in more time than other players. It shouldn't be changed or removed even if it is horrible.
---
Underrated comment
---
...starting from WotLK, it wasn't a thing in vanilla/TBC, nor was battleground xp.
---
Can paladins remove the debuff with Divine Shield, or does it remain? Also what about Flask of Petrification? Does Judgement of Light count as a heal and debuff you too?
---
I’m so glad I’m not the only one who recognizes his name and just reads what nonsense he has to say against classic.  
---
Got to agree with this really. 
---
There's a few ways of levelling a paladin. The fastest is to focus on your personal DPS as Ret, and this is the above recommendation. You can either do as stated above and go for the Reckoning build, or you can get 30 ret and 21 holy (in whatever order) and have a build that lets you DPS and Heal really well.
---
If you have any intention to regularly tank instances, you're much better off getting 11 in Holy first, then going up the Prot tree and levelling with a 1hander and shield and trying to do as many instances as possible. Once you get Reckoning this also becomes pretty decent.
---
The problem Paladin has is that you basically NEED Consecration to be able to effectively tank an instance as it's your best source of threat for more than one mob. And if you get Consecration first, you cant get Seal of Command until 31 which is very late and will make the 20-31 period of levelling (which is frequently heavy grinding in Duskwood and Stranglethorn Vale I think) quite slow without SoComm. 
---
Alternatively get 11 ret first and dont think about tanking anything until Scarlet Monastery at 31+, where you get Consec, and then keep pushing up Ret tree. At least you can heal nicely with the 10 intellect boost.
---
Where’s the option for tbc and wotlk 
---
I would not describe this as excess.
---
Having a single disconnect wouldn't really be that bad. If you're having multiple disconnects, then either you should stop playing anyway until your internet is fixed or you're purposely leaving.
---
You don't need leatherworking to profit off of devilsaurs, only skinning.
---
Does this not just defeat the classic experience? 
---
I think you're right on this one.
---
Yeah i suppose unless you are really good at the game you are playing and maybe getting clips posted on reddit then you can grow that way
---
Dude, everyone knows we'll be playing classic in personal shards, only subscribed through wow tokens on our free boosts to level 60 with the next xpack. Any mount available in vanilla will be purchasable in the WoW store and full naxx sets will be buyable from launch.
---
having to wait 15 mins for a single disconnect? seems pretty shitty to me
---
Yikes

Elorien, Night Elf Warrior, originally in Category 5 until towards the very end of vanilla where I joined Sleepless Knights.  I stuck it out initially in TBC, until it became clear a few months in that we had too many warriors in the guild.  My original plan was to swap over to Shaman anyways for TBC, so when it was clear we needed someone to stop being a tank while we also had zero Shamans on Alliance, I made Bigeasy, Draenei Shaman, and played primary Elemental, though I swapped to Enhance for Mu'ru and Vashj, and Resto for Twins.  In WotLK I became Skeleton Jack the Death Knight.
---
I remember HTTH actually.

As a horde player...fuck you. But this was funny. If a lvl 8 has the balls to stare you down in YOUR starting zone. Just leave them alone.
---
Made it easy mode. Cute 
---
The problem is that the system in modern WoW is automated, and it has been made very easy to report people. This makes it much more prone to abuse.
---
And again, stop saying "the community" as if a few randoms reporting someone represent "the community". Such utter horseshit. 
---
That will keep you in pretty good gear as you level. Lot of "know-it-alls" poo poo on crafting profs as you level. Truth of the matter is, its a lot of fun to level with a crafting profession and it rewards you. 
---
Here's a Goblin tip for making gold: Don't do what everyone else is doing. Everyone else is going to level with skinning and probably herbalism, then drop skinning for engineering at 60. Leatherworking will be one of the least popular professions I promise you. Since you're a hunter, you will have a very easy time obtaining the Hide of the Wild. That cloak is preraid BIS for every healing class. Mucho dinero hombre.
---
I absolutely love to plan routes or follow guides while playing something I'm unfamiliar with.
---
So, I'm looking for 
---
1) A well done leveling guide (with a focus on efficiency, also I'll likely be alliance scum)
---
2) Gold making guide (maybe just farm spots for mobs, herbs, or ores, while lvling)
---
3) Comprehensive class guide that includes leveling and gearing priorities at fresh 60 (specifically rogues and warriors, but a place that has all classes would be nice to help friends). 
---
Seeing as there are so many out there, I thought I'd ask here instead of using whatever google decides to show me. I'm sure there are some great guides out there due to pservers, but maybe there are new ones out there too that are being made for classic. Thanks for reading.
---
haha WHAT the FUCK? hes just one years olds and he's killing all those old orcs. I like this video mostly alot I think!
---
Good for you. I encourage this sub's brown nosed ass kissers to continue downvoting a fact stated by the devs.
---
&gt; And again, stop saying "the community" as if a few randoms reporting someone represent "the community"
---
They literally do, though.  And over time, the majority will decide how to behave when it comes to reports.  If most people don't care, then the community will foster a very lax reporting atmosphere.  If people do care, then reports will be taken more seriously.  The cases of people being silenced or banned for illegitimate reasons are *exceedingly* rare.
---
I may play on an RPPvP for a better community, but a PvP server for me isn't a feature it's a requirement. Never played on a PvE server and never intend to. 
---
In my heart of hearts I want to be a twitchy, lightning quick Rogue or Mage with top end Naxx gear and a reputation on the server.  In reality I have a fulltime job and I just dont think I'm as good at the game as I used to be. 
---
It's a weird thought to wrap my head around as someone that organized premades and structured GM climbs in Vanilla and got Gladiator all 4 seasons on multiple toons on BG9 in TBC. I'm just not very good anymore, at least I cant with confidence say that "itll come back".
---
So yeah I'm hesitant to roll a class with a ton of competition.
---
2011 ;) just a little kid playing his hunter Haha good old days... cant wait 
---
will Curse re-release all the classic addons or will they at least be available to work? It would be a pain for me to play without bartender
---
I don't have any suggestions for you, sorry.
---
But I am commenting to let you know that you're not alone, this situation sounds spookily identical to mine - my son is also 11 months old, and I have similar commitments.
---
I know it sounds lame, but WoW was a huge part of my teenage years, I spent an absurd amount of time on this game. 
---
Classic being released makes me want to do it all over again - I wish I could put my responsibilities aside for a couple of weeks, just to be a tourist in my youth once again.
---
A lot of people say that we look at classic through rose tinted glasses - this may be true to some degree, but even if the game is exactly, so many of us, the players, have changed and we're going to experience it differently as a result.
---
The reporting system does not take into account the views of "the majority". It takes into account the views of those motivated individuals utilizing the anonymous and accountable reporting system for a variety of reasons, some unsavory. It's not a vote.
---
On some level you understand this to be an issue which is why you keep trying to couch this in "community". You can't just admit that you want it to be easy to get people you don't like kicked from the game without any hassle. It's a fine position to take, but you should be honest about it. 
---
Be careful with playing wow “mindlessly” whilst also doing something with your wife - ie watching Netflix.  It may come across as you’re not interested in the time spent together. 
---
I bought WoD and never played it. 50 euros wasted.
---
Thanks for supporting! I tried a little bit on p-servers, and actually it felt oddly similar, not old and clunky as one may think. If I had time I think I would probavly choose to go all in again. 
---
Good point, only being half present. I already get that quite a lot without computer games actually....
---
Why are you asking it here? In a healthy relationship you both have time for yourself. How much exactly depends on how you balance stuff in your life. What do you think is important? What does your wife think? Is your kid demanding? Who does what in your relationship? 
---
We dont know what your life looks life. 
---
Sry low effort/superficiality
---
Not for me. I've leveled so many 60's. I mainly just want to rush to 60 and get geared. In my free time I will be a traveling wizard who assists young adventurers. Then when the server reaches 60 I will join them in glorious raids/WPvP/RP.
---
Did i state it was good? No. I mentioned they had a beta test. 
---
Totally. I used to do it even if I was mounted. Great video, thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; It shouldn't be changed or removed even if it is horrible. 
---
Yeah, most coherent sentence ever.
---
Why do you believe such lengthy durations need to be imposed in order to deter dodging?
---
For instance, who is going to employ the strategies outlined in the video with a 30 minute deserter debuff? If dodging would _not_ be commonplace with a 30 minute debuff, then any amount over 30 minutes would be excessive, right?
---
And how much does the steepness of the ramp up impact whether dodging would be commonplace?
---
Justh roll on a pvp server and go rp there :---d
---
Don’t be so hard on pala tanking - there’s a lack of tanks and players know what they are doing when asking one to tank. Most pala tanks don’t go at that lightly, they know their weaknesses. TBH I’d rather have a pala tank than a ret dps...zzz
---
Damn I actually didn't know - I just remember grinding Hodir ones on like 6 alts that all was around 6-6.3k gearscore but no shoulder enchant :^)
---
To each their own.  But the community spends all this time trying to get classic and I would for us to pervert it with quality of life fixes that may hurt the community. 
---
Blizzard was allowed to do its own thing for a while. Its only recently that they started getting pressure as a result of bad stock performance.
---
I remember way back in tbc/wrath era even back then people said the only thing that could kill wow was itself little did we know it would come full circle.
---
You had to do that massive quest chain to unlock the faction, but it wasn't dailies until you could just turn in Relics of Ulduar for rep. And you only had to do it on one toon, since the shoulder enchants were BoA.
---
That makes sense. Good luck in your search! 
---
Wasn't the BoA thing in a later patch? I know I wrote 6k gearscore so ICC but it certainly wasn't BoA in Ulduar.
---
Interestingly enough, of the 5090 people who played BFA, 2499 people say that they are still subscribed (49.1%) and 2590 people are no longer subscribed (50.1%) with one no-answer. Your conjecture is correct.
---
Dual spec was pretty nice...
---
As someone who wants to take their time leveling up, do dungeons, and generally experience as much of the game as possible, I'm excited to try this out.
---
Keep up the good work.
---
There is already a group finder addon on vanilla pservers right now. The way it works is it scans your chat and anyone spamming "LFG RFC" it will place into a handy UI filtered and sorted by instance so you just pick what dungeon you want to run and it will give you a drop down of various groups currently forming and give you the option to whisper the party leader. It's quite genius, it adds a nice clean ui for those lazy and doesn't impact normal player behavior.
---
I also tried a couple of private servers, not long before my son was born.
---
Both times, I had a blast - I reached level 42ish, got my mount and then packed it in.
---
I suspect that the same thing might happen again, and that's OK because I'll have fun regardless.
---
I'm really lucky, I have a good job, a nice home, a great son and partner, but how good would it be to relive the old times and just smash wow for 12 hours per day at the weekend?
---
I know this is a shit comment, but I'm feeling a bit sentimental about classic being re-released.
---
If there aren't official rp-pvp servers the community will decide on an unofficial one. 
---
I don't remember it ever changing, but it was definitely BoA during ICC. Either way, you didn't have to do dailies if you didn't want to. It's one of the reasons I like wrath so much. I hate dailies.
---
Is hemo good for anything but better CP gen without servo arms?
---
In my testing in pre-bis it still does quite a bit less DPE than SS.
---
Debuff doesn’t really get used to fill while soloing since you are spamming it. And in a raid it worth about a corruptions worth of DPS under the most ideal melee heavy comps - so not worth a slot.
---
Point is I’m going 21 sub to prep, feels odd to not take hemo while I’m there, but I can’t see a reason to.
---
&gt; You can't just admit that you want it to be easy to get people you don't like kicked from the game without any hassle
---
It has nothing to do with whether or not I like them.  It has to do with following a super clear set of rules that we all agree to when we agree to play the game.  I'm not interested in spending my free time seeing 15 year olds drop racial slurs or call my wife a bitch, and I hope Blizzard holds up their end of the agreement and people like that get banned.  Nothing of value is lost.
---
Here is a new idea every time you get on a flight path you have to jog on the spot for its duration.  As you level you use flight paths more frequently and the trips get longer.  You can even add in extras like waiting for a boat/zeppelin then do press ups or sit-ups while you wait.  
---
Then if you actually die you have to spend the whole corpse run sat with you legs out in front of you so you are sat in an L position, my got that hurts after only a short time.
---
This will help you build some core strength and burn a few calories.
---
It's different when they are this optional.  I would agree having something like this baked in to the game would be horrible.  Keeping it separate allows each individual the freedom to choose, which I think is the best of all worlds.
---
It’s safe to say there will be hundreds of new / updated add ons that will work with classic. Classic is going to be bigger than an Xpac and mod devs will be making all your favorites from day 1.
---
How many times are people going to post this video 
---
They did get banned in Vanilla WoW, bud. I remember getting banned just for saying "fuck". Difference was the GMs did it instead of a group of malicious players abusing an automatic system.
---
For whatever reason you don't seem to get that distinction.
---
You could quit your job, I'm not saying you should, but I bet some do to be able to achieve GM/HWL. What I meant by the last part was that I want vanilla as it was, with changes, especially major ones it's not the same game anymore.
---
Songs like this only meant that people cared about the game enough to make them. Vanilla WoW was truly something.
---
Like I said, I'm familiar with automated systems like this.  Cases of people being illegitimately silenced are banned are a massive minority.
---
What happens is you get people playing the "innocence" card in forums and on reddit, claiming to be unjustly silenced or banned.  Like OP in [this thread](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760626013?page=1).  But every time I've seen posts like that, the [truth](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20760626013?page=10#post-194) eventually comes to light.
---
I think the automated systems work better than you all seem to think they do.  One 4-stack of guildmates reporting you just to try and grief isn't going to result in consequences if you haven't done anything wrong.  It takes a lot more than that, and chances are if you're wracking up 100+ reports, there's a good reason.
---
I play on a private server as a mage. I ALWAYS buff and even run out of my way to do so (unless you are faster). I also give away conjured water and food. I love just buffing people. like here ya go man, go kick ass.
---
I agree with this.   Not to mention if you level only using one tree without support from others you are gimping yourself just as much as playing a sub-optimal spec.  For example a priest will never be full holy or full disc or full shadow.  This kind of post is literally a waste of time.  
---
If players know what class they want to play they can scour the web for perhaps 3 builds for each class that are comparable.  The meta also changes depending on whether you play on PVP or a PVE realm and what your focus in the game is.
---
Easier to do away with a list and just have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
---
I had a similar spec in Molten Core and some officer idiot noticed my Mind Flay and got me kicked from the guild :(
---
Oh I bet you are familiar with them. You seem like the type to make good use I'd imagine.
---
&gt; Cases of people being illegitimately silenced are banned are a massive minority.
---
&gt; posts one example as if this somehow proves his point
---
I'm glad you've given up on the "community" bullshit, though. You're the type to spam report on someone who camps you. Much more toxic than any edgy teenager.
---
when she becomes a wow widow I have some spare laundry needs doing ;)
---
Good for you.
---
Hang on to it as long as you can, the old nagas are way better than the new ones. I was actually looking for the 2012 model for ages. It felt and worked way better than the new one. I had 2 of the new nagas (post 2012 era ones) and they both broke within 12-18 months for no apparent reason, I ended up switching to Logitech, which imo feels worse but apparently they don’t break every 2 seconds like the Nagas :/
---
In classic you wont be able to run reckoning leveling so pretty useless to recommend that spec
---
Progress report: I had a level 5 human warrior already so I started there because no one dies or runs before that point anyway. Trained mining and first aid right away, hearthed back and dealt with the bandits without issue.
---
First trip up happened 30 minutes in between the the two farms at level 6, was killing a boar when a level 8 bear attacked me. Tried to fight it out and died. So I made breakfast. (Eggs and smoked salmon because I'm low carb and part native.)
---
Second thing happened a just after, was on my way back through that bear's territory to have a pie made. Wanted revenge on the bear, so I attacked it. Turned out it was a different bear, level 9 so I decided I should run. So I walked my dog for 20 minutes because I needed to anyways. (Bending my stated rules, but this was my plan from the start anyways.)
---
Third thing was getting attacked by 3 kolbalts when dumbly trying to enter the cave alone. (Only needed candles found a group for Goldtooth earlier.) Tried to run, but died. (Didn't feel like eating so I bent the stated rules again slightly, but I'd say this is a positive rule change.) Did a double set of push-ups and sit ups. (8 of each if you're curious) 
---
Forth, (level 8) tried to be careful but pulled three on the last kelp I died to the murlocks, but not before I killed one and collected the final kelp. (same double set preformed while cooking food in the inn)
---
Fifth, had to run from three bandits outside the princess field. (sit-ups) 
---
Sixth, (level 9) died and ran twice from the murlocks, not completing the quest. (Double set of burpees and ate a carrot) I resolve to be even more careful, collecting meat and mining, until level 10. Also, just remembered I have like 9 potions... Should be okay for a while.
---
Hi, /u/missing_string
---
I've been very clear about my stance on what is and is not reportable behavior.  If you want to attack a straw man, then have a good afternoon bud.
---
So here’s the problem with Paladin tanks in Classic (and I should really copypaste this every time I post in Paladin leveling threads)
---
The tanking effectiveness of Warriors and Druids depend almost entirely on the Warrior or Druid themselves. 
---
Paladin tanking, on the other hand, depends about 50% on the Paladin and the other 50% of effectiveness falls on the party.
---
This means party members need to throttle their DPS, pay extra attention to single targeting down specific targets, reduce AoE to a minimum, and eventually put up with Blessing of Salvation (something Mages especially whine about.)
---
This sounds fun and interactive, and I’m open to the idea that in a consistent, committed guild group it could be. After multiple wipes on every PuG experience from 20-30 it stops being fun and interactive. Players will quickly learn that it’s more efficient (and more fun) to wait an extra 30 mins for a Warrior/Druid than have the fucking Paladin tank. 
---
All my warnings fly out the window if you overgear or over-level the dungeon, which many Prot Paladin guides actually suggest. The fact that overgearing a dungeon is a primary tanking mechanic of Paladins should also put a nail in the coffin of any enthusiasts who think they want to. 
---
You can use any weapon.
---
Are you some kind of discount school shooter who keeps a kill list of people who agitate them?
---
Thats a worthless beta, where they won't have the time to even fix the issues caught. Ala fallout 76
---
You might not have the /sit macro, but it’s still better (and more efficient) than any alternative. 
---
I agree. This is the sad state of Paladin leveling, my friend. 
---
Your sub doesn’t have to be active to post on forums. If you can’t talk due to level 10 log in make a character up to level 10 or just log in and it should update your character list so you can choose one above level 10.
---
Moving the release date closer 
---
The only thing you've been clear about is your preference for easy, automated reporting rather than the GM based system we had in, you know, Vanilla. 
---
I think my assumptions have been quite generous, because the alternative explanation is that you just want to save Blizzard money.
---
They are a good solo class leveling and strong in raids and in pvp. Plus finding rare pets that are actually stronger than a regular mob is a neat aspect of the gameplay
---
Thanks for watching!
---
Outside of Naxx, yes.
---
Quoting myself:
---
&gt; It has nothing to do with whether or not I like them. It has to do with following a super clear set of rules that we all agree to when we agree to play the game.
---
Is corpse gaming reportable as per the ToS?  No, it isn't.  Is ganking?  No.  Is Rolling "need" on off-spec items a reportable offense?  Absolutely not.
---
Are racial slurs, homophobia, and personal harassment reportable?  Yes, and they should be.
---
This could not be more clear.  Break the rules, get reported, get banned.  Good riddance.
---
Man I hope you're not a healer.
---
No doubt the best guide for vanilla and private servers for many years has been Joana’s guide. At least for Horde side. Download Atlas and Joana’s Atlas Suite do you can use the guide in game. Joana holds the speed leveling record for vanilla.
---
Will Classic WoW be playable on Macs?
---
So a """""""""""""""""""fact"""""""""""""""" stated by the devs means I definitely didn't have fun there in my 265 days played in Vanilla? GOT IT.
---
I’m in. 
---
By the time wow hits, I’ll be rocking a Netflix watching, non-pc gamer gf, almost two year old daughter and a newborn baby. 
---
A guild with adults in the same situation would be awesome. 
---
Nice, much appreciated
---
&gt;Nice, I like this so I'll definitely throw it in, thank you.
---
Ah yes, the Batman approach to online gaming.
---
Not funny.
---
It's not unprecedented
---
This and the edit is a tad cringe ma guy.
---
Sounds pretty neat. What I'm interested in especially is what addons will come from classic if the sddon api is as advanced as what's available in the legion client it's based on. Downside is super hand holdy raid mods for fights that only have like 1 mechanic to begin with. Otherwise, cool stuff like what you mentioned. 
---
The only respectable twink to ever exist
---
His lv52 rogue ganking video is brilliant too
---
I thought you were done with this discussion? Get off your soapbox buddy. Shilling for automated moderation doesn't make you some kind of hero.
---
Well, I don't expect RPPvP to be filled with rogues. If we look at the private servers, rogues are... usually at the third or fourth spot, being less popular than warriors, mages and sometimes priests.
---
Where all those extra rogues (compared to the survey data) might come from? If we look at the players that don't know much about vanilla, they are more likely to pick something else, as rogue is currently one of the least played classes on retail and lost it's flavor long ago. So it can be only those that will watch some roguecraft vids and wanting to play rogue to "kill noobs". I expect most of them not bothering with RP and going straight for the PvP server. At least that's how I think about this type of people.
---
Playing Rogue on a PvE server sure feels weird... picking a "gank class" to be unable to gank. But I like so much more about Rogue, more meaningful rotation than most dps classes, poisonmaking, pickpocketing, lockpicking... rogue just feels straight up fun. Also, no more those dreaded manapots (priest/paladin player here...). 
---
And luckily, you can take about 6 rogues per raid. This is 15%, which is quite a lot. While for Druid even 10% is concerning as you usually don't stack much druids. We've usually raided with 2-3 druids (and one of them was cat).
---
Classic will be using a modern architecture and as such we won't get progressive/incremental bug fixes.
---
They're going to base the game off of the 1.12 data, and gate PvE and PvP content (and only content, as far as we know so far).
---
[Here's their current plan.](https://www.wowhead.com/news=288408/classic-wow-will-have-staged-content-unlocks-including-gates-of-ahnqiraj)
---
It's not a soapbox.  It's just a better way of cleaning the trash out of the community.  Dislike it if you want, but you're wrong.
---
I am in the same boat, except with a 2 y/o and one on the way. 
---
My plan is to take it slow, real slow. Classic is going to be out for a lot longer this time around, much longer than the first time around, we also have the luxury of fleshed out online DBs and guides. I’d suggest finding a mature guild where casual players are welcomed, you aren’t going to spend all your day grinding either way.
---
As for your personal life, family comes first. What I/we do is set aside time during the evenings for personal things, if they coincide (like watching a movie or a show), great, if not, that’s not a big deal either. Doing something by yourself is important, co-dependence is an ugly beast. 
---
Make gaming your hobby, if your spouse doesn’t like it, that’s fine. Nothing worse than people preaching obvious subjective pastimes, and wow is certainly not for everyone. 
---
See, I understand the downvotes, but this guy is right.
---
My girlfriends the same.
---
Compromise is i do a lot of my basic wowing on my laptop with mouse next to her on the couch at night watching Netflix.
---
Raiding and PvP is done on the big desktop and she is understanding. 
---
90% of those were sounds from Everquest
---
link?
---
You gave me one more reason to hate pally Clap 
---
So would push ups, and I don't have to leave the room or delay my game for minutes.
---
-easy and fast to level
---
-pve rotation and pet management, pulling and kiting (not as boring as 1 button frostmage)
---
-good dps 10-60 and in early MC, later on worst dps out of the 5 dps classes in pve 
---
-mediocre in 1vs1 pvp; usefull in group pvp due to your cc (traps, slowshot, scatter shot) and harassment (pet, vipern sting) 
---
All in all kinda fun to play both in pve and pvp, but dont expect to be god tier dps/burst like warriors, rogues and mages.
---
Yeah, I'm with you. Changed my approach already. Death can be a double set of the workouts.
---
Bank characters are the solution
---
Just lol @ thinking you aren't "the trash" buddy. Funnily enough self-righteous carebare types like you are pretty easy to bait into breaking the ToS (used to do this even in Classic lol, farming spergouts). People like you never imagine themselves to accountable to the same rules they love so much.
---
Accurate username.
---
Maybe.  I've never been silenced or banned from a game in around 20 years of playing online games though, so maybe you're just wrong again.
---

*Grabs torch.*
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
There is no beta (yet?). If you sub now without buying BFA, you can level up to 110 and check out everything up to and including the Legion areas of the game.
---
If there is no open Beta, I might sub a week or 2 early to check it out with my level 85s.
---
Funny and sad
---
I’m in the same boat man and I have to say - playing wow like I used to is just off the table. I have too many professional and personal responsibilities to devote more than a few than a few hours a week to this game and it’ll never be the same as it used to be when I raided end game content four days a week. That said, I’ve been playing vanilla for the past four months just to get ready for classic because I really do love this game. I still haven’t hit 60 (hit 56 so far) because I just can’t devote the time I used to but I’m still having a ton of fun playing. It’s definitely a different experience not being logged in constantly chatting in vent with guildies who are also on all the time, maintaining those close relationships with gullies just isn’t as easy as it used to be. 
---
In other words yes it’ll be a completely different experience from playing when you had more time to devote. But it’s still an extremely fun and rewarding game to play. Tamper your expectations a bit and don’t sacrifice time spent doing things you need to keep your family and career life healthy. The game still as addicting and time-intensive as it used to be. 
---
The changes werent made for casuals. They were made because people didnt want to tank and servers with very low pops could take HOURS to get a instance group going. 
---
This literally all stems from the idea that Blizzard has never and seemingly will never shutdown a server to take control of population issues. This, to me, is the biggest issue classic will face. If blizzard continues to think that it can solve problems as they did at the end of wrath and onward. We are just going to end up in the same place again. X-realm Queues and LFD.
---
Same, I play on my laptop during netflix hours - makes it easier to decide on something to watch to when I don’t really care what we choose since I’ll only be kinda listening anyway. 
---
Wow, you got yourself a keeper!
---
Enjoy the read. Still waiting for my copy - can’t wait to get my hands all over it.
---
What an accomplishment! You must be quite proud.
---
I've enjoyed our chat though you are such a stereotypical redditor its uncanny. Not surprised about the 100k+ karma. Bragging about never being banned is peak fuckin reddit 😂😂😂
---
sorry, i wasent awear that everyone in europe spoke the same language back in vanilla. if i remember right the only 2 servers that were non english were german and french. so. feel like trying again?
---
I am proud.  It isn't hard to be a kind person when playing video games.
---
Get an ultrabook, play it in the couch while you both "watch" the netflix show.
---
I’m planning on going back to Doomhammer with the same exact character if it works out like that lol
---
Surprised how many people in this thread use this exact same technique. Been doing this for a while while leveling on a  nonblizz server. 
---
Nothing quite like using my mage portal and falling 15 yards when I arrive. That mana bomb really fucked shit up, the chairs float.
---
Why wouldn't there be RP-PvP servers? I played on one in vanilla and so did many others.
---
&gt;not getting banned proves im kind
---
redditor "logic" at its best lmfao
---
Any tips or resources for doing sunday meal prep? i’ve been starting to get into this for creating more time and saving money but I feel like i’m just eating the same pattern week after week. 
---
Hi, /u/OG_Goob
---
I don't have a kid, but like you and most of us my family situation has deepened and involves more people than when I was single and in college. I'm going with a three party strategy.
---
First, spend time where it needs to go first. By making sure the wife and work are 100% happy each day they won't interrupt my WoW time.
---
Second, help her see WoW more like I do. Mine won't play PC games either, but she's gotten to appreciate the social aspects, the competitive itch it scratches, and even one raid buddy that was my best man.
---
Third, prepare for launch day like it's a raid on work, wife, chores, etc. I'll drop a few extra hours at work. If launch day is on a Tuesday the wife and I will have an extra special weekend and date beforehand. She'll be up to her eyeballs in flowers and chocolate. On Monday, my home will be the cleanest one on the block.
---
I'll be hitting it hard with a day or two off and power leveling to 60, but you get the point.
---
only tabard/hippo pet/turtle mount were in vanilla, and very late
---
everything else is tbc or later
---
I tried this too. We didn’t even get our dwarves out of the starting zone and she just had me on follow the whole time once she figured out it was possible. The only game she’s ever gotten into is animal crossing... lol. 
---
Man, what a leap!  It's almost like those are two separate statements and not linked in the way you imply!
---
Giving you a C for effort on this troll, though.
---
&gt;he disagrees with me so he must be a troll
---
Do you redditors have some sort of conversation guide like telemarketers do? Now you just have to loudly declare that you're going to report me and the cycle is complete.
---
bad troll is bad
---
Mm she’s been watching some stupid fuckn show about the devil in a suit with a British accent solving crimes in Los Angeles with a hot detective. Bizarre. I’d rather farm Eko.
---
When I know that there's a chest or two inside a cave I'll rush through using everything I have to delay the mobs and get those chests before anyone else. I don't care if you're going through dozens of mobs to get there, I'm looting that chest before you if I can.
---
Got my copy a few days ago -- Interesting for sure, and the quality of the book is second to none. I may not own a lot a book, only enough to fill one bookshelf, but this is definitely the most quality book I have. It's seriously so nice.
---
Are you saying that leveling guides aren't vanilla because you'd be wrong. People wanted to get to max level back then too.
---
What are you talking about, Uldir is probably the best first tier raid they ever did. Too hard for you? 
---
You are a god while leveling and in the early 60 content, especially in the world PvP. Hunter is probably the best solo class in the game. In raids, you do above average dps early on and then you start falling off due to bad scaling with gear. By the end of the progression, you are bottom tier DPS. However, hunters are always needed in raids (4-5 in early MC, later on 2-3 per raid) due to their tranquilizing shot and pulling + kiting potential. With the amount of hunters out there though, it is usually one of the classes that might have trouble finding a raidspot. In solo PvP, you are great (again better early than later) and you are also quite useful in group PvP (utility, defensive capabilities, counter to casters). In conclusion - Great solo, not that powerful and desirable in groups. Great early on, not that bottom tier later. 
---
I think the time you spend playing and planning for WoW would be better spent in therapy. Or at least doing a deep personal examination to get a handle on the deeper problems you're apparently facing.
---
uhhh, wow is a video game buddie it seems like you need to CALM down
---
I wanna put the ballpark at 10? Seems low initially but I feel like after a few months that’ll be all they need. Maybe even less. Nost was only one server after all. 
---
Is it available for horde yet?
---
What is wrong with jaina's hair in the 2nd one? 
---
I'll just leave this here.

Can you link some? I'm curious.
---
&gt; -mediocre in 1vs1 pvp
---
Huh?
---
Let me help get you started. I reread your list, and point number 5 raises a red flag. You hate redditors and are a redditor. This deep-seated self-hatred you seem to hold and perpetuate by posting repeatedly on Reddit might be a gateway to your other problems. Maybe explore that to start?
---
Yeah, the state of every single one of Blizzard's IPs are in disarray from poor decision making. I don't see how Classic will be immune to this, it doesn't bode well. 
---
call me fucking crazy all you want to. i don't want anymore than one of each ruleset.
---
1) Anyone who opening admits that they use a KOS list. Straight to the kill list.
---
Is this not pertinent to the development of classic?
---
I mean it's been shit since cata so I wouldn't say great since 2008
---
im not a redditor bro you take that back
---
Now, now. Denial isn't going to make this any easier in the long run.
---
Plenty of games now that have internal QA testing end up great
---
Only caveat - if you're demonology, the "sacrifice demon" talent is your spell, not your demons. So if you're trying to sacrifice your voidwalker for that massive shield buff, you can't while stunned
---
And my point is that you can't compare internal QA testing games to games needing both. WoW is obviously not a game you only QA test before releasing it.
---
This looks like a man/boy face with tits
---
Yikes. I didnt think angsty 12 year olds would be interested in vanilla wow.
---
redditor is a mentality not a website brotha
---
You're crazy.
---
How did they kill Overwatch?
---
How does paladin compare to priest when it comes to keybinds?
---
One thing I am hoping to avoid is huge clutter from lots of spells and downranked spells. Paladin seems to have fewer spells that you need to press on a constant basis and cleanse is a bit of an all in one button. Is that a fair characterization? Is priest that bad? They do have heal, greater heal, flash heal, renew, power word shield and prayer of healing which does seem like a lot. 
---
You may want to read a bit of the threads first ;)
