I have one, I just really like the play style of seals with the Paladin.
---
---
---
Of course!
---
Depends on the run, but most of the bosses you can just skip and reset.  Idea is just to get most efficient xp
---

Go to a different server. Why wait hours to play when you don't have to?
---
Can’t players just press tab?
---
Tf is this
---
So i just tried this out and for me the /sit variant was proccing more often but that may be anecdotal.
---
Maybe I’m wrong for assuming but I thought everyone knew skull=kill first X=kill second. Idk how many times I’ve seen ppl immediately attack the unmarked mob in packs of 3 lol
---
I wasn't but the rest of the guild were
---
Ah yes I remember now, thank you.
---
I still don't understand this reddit theme going on of "lets complain about how everyone is playing the game and blame it on retail as if it didn't happen before." Like if you don't want people who do this then find a guild make friends and don't do dungeons until you have a group of known people who won't do it. Complaining to reddit isn't going to stop it.
---
I usually find Elwynn to be the closest equivalent. Maybe because I play on RP servers so... oh god, the horror...
---
Ah, good to know! Cheers!
---
Based on that argument, nameplates should just be removed entirely then. They already don't work like the vanilla nameplates anyway.
---
Good luck man,  "rare" and "elite" have actual meanings in vanilla/classic. Not like that fake retail bullshit where there's a "rare" every 10 minutes of exploring an area.
---
Sorry to hear that... My experience in classic regarding world PvP has been great thou, not much camping and a lot of help from the faction if in conflict. You are not old to play videogames (I'm 36 yo myself), just bear in mind that, like in everywhere IRL, there will always be a-holes, just don't mind them.
---

---
Which server are you playing on? Last resort, ask if anyone from your guild (people you can chat through the general are in the same layer as you, so an invite from them won't work) can invite you to a group so you may be phased to another layer, with other players, mobs, etc..
---
I wish you better luck, man!
---
As a hunter,  it feels pretty bad these days despite my completely acceptable dps.
---
The estimate time is just based on a sample of the queue moving and should NOT be taken seriously. The real thing to look at is position in queue. In my experience, during peak time, the queue moves about 900-1500 an hour
---
Fighting near big pool of water as a druid in PvP you're nearly unkillable. Need to regen : just flee underwater. The guy is following? Roots this guy underwater and watch him drown and stay out of range if it's a caster
---
And king mosh was roaming around too
---
&gt;(Like yourself) 
---
lol
---
Not sure if it makes a difference but are you sure you grabbed a version compatible with classic?
---
as a healer, I dont even like taking a tank into my dungeons anymore. its more much more efficient and fun to just take 2 mages and a warlock and wahtever else and just pull entire rooms. when we dont have an AOE comp and the tank has to pull 1 group of mobs at a time, im falling asleep from boredom. I get the tank sets the pace and whatever, but god damn some tanks go so fucking slow.
---
Yea please make a separate post when you make this. I hate it when my guildies have Spy and it pops off a KOS player for me in an adjacent zone, and I can’t see where they are!
---
Because hes lying, and wants to try and speed it up anyway. Either because hes impatient and wants to gain XP faster, hes trying to show off his elite dps skills in a dungeon, or he was actually dumb enough to enter a dungeon without planning his day ahead of playing a video game.
---
Is this NA thing or what? Not one player in 50+ dungeons I've tanked (as feral) have complained about speed being too slow on EU server. It's almost only pugs, so there have been few hundred potential whiners involved. I pull fast but never two full packs at once.
---
You're probably wondering how I got myself into this situation?
---
Every increase to tank damage is an increse to TPS which a allows dps to do greatly moredamage before they pull aggro. DPS wasn't limited by raw damage limit it was limited by threat cap. By having warriors have 15% additional rage generation they are having a greater than 15% increase in TPS and a grete than 15%  increase in dps. We aleady have a static base increase of 15% and every other abillity that was buffed ontop of that

The classic feel exists at lower levels where there aren't as many tryhards. Around level 40 is when you start running into these annoying players who must play one way because every other way sucks.

I’m really happy to see blizzard offering the in game GM services.
---
good now stock price move please
---
I play with max clutter and disable all names.
---
Now this is a useful comment.
---
You could actually just play the game
---
Let's be real. Majority of people playing classic are for its nostalgia and simplicity. You can hardly call it better than retail as they aren't balancing anything. How can a game be better if you're forced out of a spec you want to play if you want to advance in a decent guild? I know that's a common point brought up but its a huge one.  Of course you'll see outliers but that's what they are. I liked classic when I played it. Killing the demons all over azeroth to get rhok bow was awesome, but the balance changes alone improve it greatly.  Not to mention all the quality of life stuff retail has now so you don't have to download fucking 15 mods that are deemed borderline essential by top players.  In classic I had a threat meter, dps meter,  and a coordinates mod... that's it.
---
The loot does not infer the same value to everyone. How much value each player can gain from the gold is difficult if not impossible to determine, which is why the loot should go to the player who can equip and literally use it. Classy till the end, nice. Enjoy your evening.
---
Yes, with all the others that are working fine. Anything I have added in the last week will not show in the add-ons section or otherwise. It's like I hit a cap.
---
This is the best thing I've seen online all day.
---
I had no idea about Leatrix. I downloaded weakauras thinking I could get all customizable, opened up the menu for it and thought “wtf am I looking at”, and never opened it again lol.
---
But Leatrix looks like everything I wanted in a single addon. Now the trouble will be deciding which addons it makes futile.
---
Yes, I got it from  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/elvui-adibags/files](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/elvui-adibags/files)  and clicked on 1.13.2 specifically.
---
Currently level 53, and yeah, I feel you. I've only been leveling through dungeons, but other than that, I don't really do quests anymore. I just find them so boring and tedious to do.
---
I play on max graphics. AMA.
---
If this is indeed real, I think people should start to seriously look at the negative health effects of grindy games like this. First it was Asmonbald who had a fuckton of empty energy drink cans filling his entire desk space, now this.
---
Does Leatrix Maps also have the dungeon maps? Or just shows on world map where the dungeons are?
---
It sounds like classic isn't a good fit for your play style, which is fine. You're right, classic dungeons are definitely slower.  Lots of people enjoy the pace and prefer it over the single player action game retail has begun. It's OK if you aren't one of those people, but instead of complaining about classic, maybe you should just play the version you do enjoy.

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic but that's not how it works. You'll never be on a layer with less than hundreds of people.
---
In this case, Timbermaw rep doesn't start at 0. Otherwise, yes, it would normally take that long. If you decided to work on Bloodsail Buccaneers rep, for example, then yes, massive grind.
---
Bartender has a mouse over keybinding option and I love it.
---
Honestly, I found the best way to get through that is to just straight grind for a level or few.  Sounds counterintuitive, but the XP per hour is guaranteed to go at a very good pace, whereas questing can end up having a lot of dead time, and seeing that bar increase quicker is encouraging.  In my 30s, I went to Swamp of Sorrows and did laps around the lake killing whelps (potential for rare minipet that will sell for lots of gold on AH)
---
55ish. Depends on your classes.
---
Main issue will be fighting the 60s going for it.
---
Thank you for your kind advice. I am going to try that.
---
Thanks for explaining ordinal numbers to us. I was confused about what came after two.
---
Noted on Deep Wounds, but yeah I was mostly talking about the lack of MS. Not being able to use your main damage ability kills your damage in raids, although you can still offtank just fine.
---
&gt; Blizzard's main source of income comes from paid services like mounts and race changes 
---
Ive seen people saying this for months, is there a source for this? Im finding it really hard to believe.
---
Thorium is selling for multiple gold per bar, but I expect that to nose dive in the next week.
---
No don’t use the ElvUI one.  You just need the standard AdiBags v1.9.17-classic
---
still wild that the BIS tank druid weapon is usable by level 43.
---
I'd be down to clown with gobbo chicks ngl
---
[removed]
---
Imagine tryharding a 15 year old video game lmao
---
Maybe there's some other mod in conflict with it. Try disabling all mods and enabling AdiBags to see if it works. If so, you gotta enable mod by mod so you can pinpoint which one is the culprit.
---
I do it on three accounts, it’s easy, just be zoomed out and watch all three on each screen, free mouse moving back and forth, fishing action on hot bar to recast. Boom baby.
---
Sounds like he needed some ice before that.. and perhaps medical attention.

Thank you for your advice without being rude like the others.
---
Rockpounder w/ stoneslayer just slightly behind. With whirlwind axe you have 5%crit and a slight chance to hit higher level mobs better but neither of those beat the king of warrior DPS, which is weapon damage.
---
Yeah and then they don't bloody accept
---
Didn't know your wife had monopoly on duskwood mobs, sorry man.
---
My warrior is 45 and I still have that darn thing (Sm and RFD hated me) I had a healer friend 2 man up to that boss with me, still worth it even if it’s green imo
---
Yeah it was awful, I died 4 times on 2 runs of SM arms cause the shamong was being a mong. If you're healing in SM arms I shouldn't be seeing 40+dps out of you especially if I die. Wanding doesn't push that much damage lol
---
I plan to add this ASAP! Thank you for using it &lt;3
---
LMAO This is Grade A.
---
The enchant helps quite a lot :) I use it too and it’s awesome. What Server are you on?
---
It does not make a difference.
---
A ton of retail kiddies will be leaving classic for a while.  That's almost like they are giving us an update as well lol.
---
Nice troll :-)
---
Vanilla raids are on the LFR level. Then you have normal, heroic, and then finally Mythic.
---
Lolol good job dude, you’re good at a video game. Imagine being good at a career, though?
---
I think soul link warlock vs anything would like to have a word with you
---
&gt;See you in Nazjatar
---
That's where you're wrong, kiddo.
---
What do you mean by wasted space? (Besides the scrollbar slot)
---
Thank you for using it!
---
I went through that, does not work at all. :-/ Might just create a log and upload it.
---
Fair enough. I'd still recommend TSM over Skillet+Auctioneer/Auctionator for example, but whatever works. ;)
---
Yes. Which is why on pvp servers you dont have a horde or alliance superior COMMANDING you to attack the other players or die. You killing or being killed by the opposite faction per the individual's desires would be understood
---
Getting corpse camped can suck. Something important to take into consideration is that you're not bound to that zone/area. If no one is going to come help you, just move to another place and play there. Having content locked by the opposing faction is a core component of wpvp. Once battlegrounds come out, it'll die down significantly and the game will feel a bit more lifeless as a result.
---

---
You found the hidden mount vendor in the cave in STV?
---
You replied to my comment though so 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
It would be sweet if you could integrate with AutoPilot.. I always want to quests I see available but aren’t necessarily next in line for that.
---
But lucky for me, he didn’t.
---
Just where they are on the map. Atlas is what you want for dungeon maps.
---
I have a basic macro with pickpocket, then opener. I'm finding that it never loots the items, I'll basically just have to loot the body twice when I kill it, once for the pickpocket loot, once for the actual loot.
---
Is that intended or a side effect of being West coast on an East coast server?
---
that's not true at all.  lava lash was wotlk.  you can go 41 points deep into enhance without touching dual wield talents.  you can pvp just fine as 2h spec
---
I really really really enjoy questing but i love wpvp more so pve servers are not even an option but dung grinsing has lvled me faster and at 48 i have my mount good gear and 200g saved purely from dung grinding so im not hating it
---
the 200 GMs that worked in Galway were on minimum wage, some for 5+ years. Till they all got fired last year.
---
Game now feel unplayable without Leatrix maps. 
---
Just the ability to move the map window is invaluable, never mind minimize and zooming.
---
No joke, #1 addon I install and recommend to everyone I know.
---
Id love to see some concrete numbers from blizzard, which I know is not someting theyll do. This just seems so unbelievable to me, mtx being the biggest source of income in a sub based game.
---
Its so fucking depressing.
---
Naw, I meant the entrance to UBRS. You make them jump into the lake of fire.
---
Linux / Lutris launcher
---
Great list!
---
It's so hilarious that warlocks can self-summon...and hella convenient to boot.
---
Ah chromie. Most evil gnome ever
---
Maintain that attitude and other players will avoid grouping with you.
---
The aggro tablea are different. Its not the same game.
---
I just wish I had a solid group/partner to play with. My highest level is 20 :P all my IRL friends quit. I can’t manage to continue playing solo because I get bored. I’m also a bit nervous about end game because I like to PvP, but am afraid I’ll be behind the curve if I don’t raid (which I probably won’t).
---
Aaaand my hopes are shattered. Thought OP meant this was a work around from that. RIP.
---
God damnit now I can’t leave the inn for another hour..
---
I’m dumb I think, in the zip file, do I just drag and drop the classic folder into my addons? Or drag and drop all the files inside the folder labeled classic? It’s not working for me. But it could also be the action bar mods I’m using.
---
You can look up some Monkeynews pvp videos. Some are as a gnome with escape artist, but he also pvps as a human or orc.
---
 One strat he uses is to run FROM mages when he is not very close after the start of combat. This gets him out of range and some spells don't go off before completed. This forces the mage to have to close in while the slowed movement effect has worn off, letting the warrior close the gap a little faster when he subsequently engages.
---
He even pvp mages who know to use fast rank 1 frost bolts, and seeing how he deals with all that can be pretty enlightening. His play style might give you some ideas after you watch a few.
---
Haha I've been playing a rogue for over 12 years now. And it will always be my very favorite. In retail I have (in previous expansions) had a max level rogue, priest, shaman, hunter, warrior, druid, demon hunter, and warlock, and rogue will always be my very favorite. I never cared for paladin or death knight enough to level them very far. My rogue was my first toon and I am so in love with leveling another one.
---
Blizz is currently investigating, it looks like. FD has always been weird though; just like vanish and other disengage spells, it doesn't work every time. 
---

---
NINJA EDIT: I did not read the link I posted.
---
What addon shows you auction house prices? I have one that shows me vendor, but it doesnt show AH.
---
Old tank I used to run with when DPS pulled aggro would just let them die if they did it more than a couple times. When they complained he'd just say "it's all good, after they kill you they come right back over".
---
Good tanks and healers have zero issues finding groups. They set the pace, end of story.
---
 that was an orange mob that ate over half his health in a couple of seconds. Bubble, heal. Only way to be sure.
---
In general Blizzard will never tell you what has happened even if its something you report. This helps curtail vigilante justice. 
---
No one really knows the numbers or any of the punishments in detail only those banned know the punishment for themselves. But we do know it was possible bans and character rollbacks
---
The best place to see actual band is the forums where people complain about being bann. Prolly Ownedcore
---
Since its BOE you two should have rerolled.
---
It's not the shards I can't get enough of. It's sucking the souls out of my enemies that makes it fun

As a mage I basically give out 2 stacks and if they tip bigger  i give 4-5
---
Are you following me? Every time I see one of your (fantastic) posts it’s been within hours of completing the illustrated quest.
---
\*sigh\* *unzipp*
---
Same. I always thought I missed out on some vanilla fun but after cataclysm jumping in felt like turning on the TV mid-film.
---
&gt; Try to rebuff one person here and there when you find yourself with extra mana, rather than needing to take a break to rebuff everyone and drink.
---
With arcane intellect costing so much mana I almost *have* to do this, especially if everyone in the party needs it.  Shit's expensive...
---
Marshal's Refuge, you can see the shiny yellow crystal
---
well it shouldnt be special, but looking at random groups out there it definitely is.. kinda like common sense. not so common
---
It's doable, but not really required or recommended. You can get most of the same sorts of items from Wailing Caverns as Horde (dungeon and quests; think Wingblade). If you want to do Deadmines later on, it's much easier (people like to get the mask and leather set for looks) but doing it at a level where the items are useful to you is going to be a pain.
---
Go to Un'Goro and see for yourself
---
You are doing an outstanding job! I'm using this every day, and it makes the chaos so much more manageable.
---
Thank you!
---
Well, yeah, but there is a 3rd choice.
---
Server transfers and forced name changes were both things in vanilla and it's really unclear to me what either has to do with the barber shop.
---
Even better: Create a new chat window tab for lfg/world/and all the other spammy channels. I personally have general, spam and whisper.
---
Fucking idiot Mage is cancer.
---
There are numerous bugs associated with FD. Blizz is aware, but they are still working on solutions.
---
His name is bank, and i dont even remember what class he is. 
---
He sits in ratchet and returns mail I send him. Those are my plans for him forever
---
The discounts for revered and exalted don't actually exist in vanilla, so it's only the 10% off of honored
---
And the screenshots of quest logs with a lot of completed quests captioned "that incredible feeling"
---
&gt; Needing 3% less hit when using swords not that crazy op for humans.
---
The human racial gives you 3% hit, 10% less chance to get glancing blows (40%--&gt;30%) and 20% smaller penalty on glancing blows (35% penalty--&gt;15% penalty). It's definitely not small. Stoneform is only useful for PVP outside of maybe a handful of packs in Naxx and AQ40.

My main is a rogue at 33. Im leveling a Warlock that is level 21 so far. 
---
It has mining and engineering already level 100 so I have the goggles :) and since I get a mount cheap at 40 i went ahead and bought the recipe for the Savory Deviate Delights.
---
What he is suggesting would involve him playing the game.

40 main,26 alt 15 alt alt 12 altaltalt
---
Oh fuck that, if you use one of these things, I am going out of my way to kill you
---
I once rolled a warrior. Spent a few hours leveling to 18ish. Parked my arse in the capital city. Then used the LFG feature to power level to 60+ within 2 days. Although that's probably not a perfect representation, as I was getting near instant picked up because tank.
---
Immolate is a strange one as it has 2 components and you will get about 3 damage on the initial damage then a total of 9 more on the dot
---
DoTs get the full spellpower boost over the whole spell so corruption goes from 100 over 24 seconds to 100+12 over 24 seconds
---
You can look up spell coefficients to see the actual numbered formulae
---
"level up fishing"
---
That's a no from me dog. :D
---
You may be getting pushed because you don't already have a character on that realm? Either way, unless you ABSOLUTELY have to play on that realm, choose another one without queues
---
I know but people get salty, otherwise, and might misconstrue my comment as srs bsns.
---
Isn't the reagent only like 20s?
---
There’s a whole formula for stuff like this. Not as straightforward as you might think, but it’s fairly well 
---
documented.
---
[Warlock Spell Coefficients](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow#warlock-spell-coefficients-and-formulas)
---
Because theres lots of us, and theres a deficit of tanks.
---
Being casual doesn't have to be synonymous with being bad.  Wands are an essential leveling tool for priest.
---
You can get auctioneer or auctionator. You have to let them scan the AH though. Can take a while
---
Whoops sorry saw a human pic and assumed, the top end isn’t really that much higher than rockpounder and the 2% crit on rockpounder more than makes up for the 10 less top end damage IMO. I’ve also heard from multiple people in game that the proc chance on stoneslayer is garbage and that it hardly ever procs, also it’s proc chance isn’t better than a guaranteed 2% crit. But in all honesty you could use either one and it would be fine, it’s not like these are end game weapons anyways and the difference between them really isn’t going to make a huge difference. As a bonus I think rockpounder looks cooler 😎
---
Come to Benediction! It's an East Coast server, but all census data indicates a pretty even Horde/ Alliance split and it's High pop during peak hours.
---
You're objectively incorrect.
---
my first char ever on account creation? IIR was named McWigger and it was \*fine\* for 3? years.  Then bewm got the algorithm on me. I thought it was was funny as hell .. at the time .. still is if you ask me :P  I dont know that anyone ever reported me for anything ever but bewm here comes the computer.  I played exactly as dumb as the name sounds :P
---
But yeah said fuck it and switched realms
---
Oh God I don't want that addon. It would probably depress me.
---
Well at least they gave me Starcraft Remastered, WoW Classic and soon WC3 Reforged.
---
Give me also a D2 remaster and I'll love you like I used to Blizzard.
---
Is minor wizard oil in Classic? I've checked all of the horde capital city enchanted suppliers and none sell the formula. Are they just out of stock?
---
You new here? You can edit your comments
---
everyone is so hungry for loot
---
once we are a few weeks into phase 3 anyone who will use sulfuras and especially if they have the materials can have it
---
Or just always drink after leaving combat? I spam the crap out of drink as soon as the last mob dies and the tank pulls while I regen mana
---
&gt; You miss the part about how Blizzard's main source of income comes from paid services like mounts and race changes which is why BFA scored higher than classic?
---
Yeah, incoming classic services.
---
Every class that was leveling as DPS is forced into heals at 60
---
I re-installed about a month before the release just so I could see what retail was like before classic dropped, I think I lasted about 10 hours and just couldn't stand what they had turned it into. I hope they give us at least BC with this reboot.
---
Coming back to Un'Goro is this same picture but the other way around.
---
44 main hunter, 18 alt priest
---
That's why you get a load of money before you stop working, invest, and then live off of dividends.
---
Getting the load of money in the first place is the challenge, though.
---
That's my point, they're different games. You blame everything on retail have you ever thought that's how people play now independent of retail? You complained above about AoE specced mages, you know who started that meta? Not retail, private server players. Hardcore classic players invented the thing you seem to hate so much about 'retail players'
---
Level 30 warrior leveling with the wife. 26 mage solo leveling and a bank alt

As a rogue I feel this

100 UD runs a day is a VERY conservative number on my server (Firemaw EU)

Nowhere near as much aoe dps

Welcome to Australian Classic WoW
---
This. 30% stronger sac. Free resummon, 30% less damage while pet active.
---
Some people just shouldn't have pets...even thinking about having a pet is too many pets for you.
---
So many different characters. 
---
Were you testing each one to figure out what you liked most or did you get fed up with them at a certain point
---
Of course it's a thing lol
---
Are you flying through Duskwood? Why wouldn’t you just take the blimp?
---
I wouldn't mind them adding micro-transactions as long as they didn't also shit up the game play at the same time.
---
How does it work with lower ranks? Will 200 shadow damage increase rank 1 corruption by 200?
---
What’s funny is the AoE pulls are such a clusterfuck that they take longer than steady, smaller pulls.
---
All it takes is for healers to stop healing them and they’ll learn. Triage.
---
My friends and I made 3 paladins (redpally, whitepally, and bluepally) and would try and 3 man dungeons and help everyone we saw. Or we made gnome rogues named variations of Ilillilli and would gank people in turns. Super fun!

&gt; Lok tar. Respect green friend, I too do the same. Their is no honor in dog shotting. I even help kill the mob then challenge. -dwarf warrior

Right, because RP'ing on Reddit is how adults act. You're *certainly* the authority. You're a joke.

Not in this Phase. Wowhead says it will come in Phase 5.

i like some free range tauren.

You might have problems as bad as I do. Why are you such a jerk?
---
And this mentality is exactly how we got the mess that is retail.
---
In case you didn't know, the Warlock addon Necrosis allows you to set a maximum Soul shard count and auto deletes new shards.

Dude makes millions and he’s wearing the most raggedy shirt I’ve seen a streamer wear lmao. To be fair he probably doesn’t have time to go to Walmart to get new ones lol

Get on the fullest server you can. If you play still in a few months you will thank yourself.
---
Aww man. I got piled by farmers and died when Stanley attacked me so I missed the xp haha
---
Now that's just uncalled for.
---
And spirit tap...
---
Bruh this post is 3 weeks old.  Calm down
---
I have no problem with people doing this.. it's the ones who expect everyone else to level that way as well and get super shitty at people who just want to play the game.
---
You do you and all... but let me do me.
---
Sounds promising. I’m my server is straight up a dad ass server, it clears out by midnight, when I’ll late night hunt these guys soon.
---
Correct. You can only attack things in front of you so attacks from behind cant be retaliated.
---
That might work but low level as ele is gonna suck youre not gonna have enough skills to help. Id say atleast wait till 40 for respec and go enhancement untill then. Ive been enhance my whole time(lvl 41 now) and its worked pretty well.
---
\+1 for accuracy.
---
I do!  Human mounts are BORING.
---
When I first be a shaman in vanilla I didn't buy totems because I wanted to save my money up.

There was a rogue crying in this sub about a week ago for getting a 3 day ban for exploiting guards in booty Bay as a first offense. If first offense is 3 day ban then I'm sure it won't take long to reach near permaban limits. Besides, it's actually been proven that a smaller punishment like a 3 day ban improves behavior more than a permaban. If you get perma'd you can go make another account and do it again, if you get suspended and told that repeat offenses will lead to a ban then you're much more likely to behave when your suspension is up due to not wanting to lose the progress you've made on the account
---
I needed that laugh, thanks. 
---
I've had similar issues when I shorten things. A fellow player pulled an accidental second mob off me (I only meant to pull one), and I tried to thank him, but he was saying sorry at the same time. I said "thanks" (which from undead, sounds very sarcastic), he said "sorry" and I said "heh" and "one was enough". He split right away, then I realized I should have used more words. Oh well. I waved at him later, so hopefully he understood.
---
Yeah, retail
---
Stay away from me 'n muh chicken.
---
&gt;  average pleb in full time work watches 4 hours of tv a night.
---
Speak for yourself lol
---
But then you could see people through walls from 40 yards no?
---
Yeah for dungeon grinding you need a solid group of people who know what they're doing. PUGs are so hit and miss that you'll often be better off just playing normally.
---
All 3 rogue specs are good dps specs.  The biggest factor is subtlety definitely means you have to focus finding a good dagger.  A lot of people only look at the dps of combat, but not the downtime required to bandage/eat.  I find ambush specs are more fun, but you take less incoming damage since it has such a high chance to crit.  With a partner, I think sub goes even higher with the better backstab damage though.
---
But best advice is play what you enjoy, as that will keep you playing the game the longest.
---
The barrens chat on the mankrik realm has just been political garbage for the past couple days shit sucks
---
How did you guess?
---
Shutup and innervate the priest, furry!
---
Ah mb. Ye I found it’s as he mentioned hard to get spawns there on my server too.  I’m a lock as well and i just powered to 60 then u can do Mara farm. I started it in greens mate so you’ll be fine. Just make sure to have minor speed enchant boot
---
Hey, I would love a 2 tier list.
---
Where you could:
---
\- indent secondary points
---
\- that are relevant to the main todo
---
Fishing:
---
\- level to 75
---
\- train next rank
---
\- level to 150
---
In the future I'll be sure to consult you on whether what I'm doing is fun or not. I think I'm going to go pick some herbs, is that okay? Or should I go do that in retail too?
---
Stats on gear don't really support doing a hybrid melee/caster. You will find gear that improves melee damage OR spell damage, and the stuff that helps both will have worse stats. For this reason it is much more effective to specialize one way or the other.
---
Well, no. You mentioned body pulls, which is one specific example of how threat works, but I think the point people are trying to make is that the threat situation is more complicated than that.
---
Being significantly lower level than the enemy means that everything you do generates more threat and makes it harder for the tank to pull threat off of you. So the healer being lower level does materially affect the dungeon run, even if they never body pull a mob.
---
Is it enough to break the run? Probably not, but it does make things more difficult, even if marginally so. And as a fellow healer, it's totally each group's prerogative to only take people who meet the minimum recommended level (or even higher if they want to increase the odds of a smooth run).
---
They are intentionally sabotaging world PvP in classic /s
---
Please correct me if I’m wrong but AMA- Anti-Max Aliasing or whatever that long string of words is on the “Advanced” Options? Lol
---
I got whip lash watching.
---
10/10 build and delivery.
---
yea with pet on passive. if your pet gets attacked it breaks it thats why its better to scatter then spam it ontop of them.
---
I was referring to the BS we did in legion lol.
---
Problem is that it's super unforgiving for bad groups, which a lot of pugs end up being.
---
Nice
---
Don't have it yet
---
Well I was thinking of going pure elemental to open and then adding my final points into enhancement... I will say I’ve found it pretty tough early on just going elemental as I can only cast 2 lightenings before they’re on me and interrupting my spells so it’s just shocks at that time and they’re on CD’s.
---
engineering
---
Indica, really? It's interesting because had your name been an alcohol reference it probably would have been totally okay. Hmm
---
Is there an add-on that shows healing numbers on allied players like it does on retail? I miss seeing green numbers above people as I heal them.
---
It's not the devs. It's the bean counters and paper weight adjusters who decide the direction the product is going in and what bullet points need to be checked off.
---
That’s what I’m saying!
---
&gt; My best guess is that he either intentionally or unintentionally was fighting in spots that guards couldn't reach him. 
---
He was a rogue so I don't see how that can be it, unless he was in the roof safe spots throwing knives at people he's not going to do anything. He claimed to be in houses, which is legitimate. Guards don't spawn in some houses but they can path into the house and kill someone who aggros them. 
---
&gt;The right click report system abuse would require *a lot* of people to report a single person, and in many cases that only results in a mute, because it's typically related to something like spamming not PvP. In those cases players usually get the decision overturned when appealed. It's something that typically happens to guys like streamers who can get enough people to mass report them in a very small window. 
---
he was in BB for an hour and a half, the other faction probably called in chat to mass report him because they were getting angry about being camped. Doesn't explain why it wasn't overturned unless they are going to make the rules around PvP more strict. 
---
&gt;I remember there was a big one about a year ago where the guy claimed it was a unfair ban, based on PvP, but it turned out he was banned for something like botting software or something similar instead. Or maybe account sharing? Can't recall. Had egg on his face, trying to actually figure it out with the rep in the comments.
---
I found one where he was banned for harassing people but it seemed like it was for PvP based on timing. I would hope that blizz isn't going to ban people for wPvP because its a totally optional part of the game but again, as the guy in that thread was a rogue I can't really see what he was doing that was bannable. If he was on roofs he wouldn't be able to do anything that anyone would report for.
---
My wife and I quote that bit ALL THE TIME.
---
Identity theft is not a joke, OP. Millions of families suffer every year.
---
2000% blood in Liero
---
Not quite.
---
How consistent is it? Did you drain tank or vw tank before? Do you have to drink a lot?
---
What's the ad on for the hotbar at the bottom
---
So no quest mobs spawning for anyone because all of the spawns are already accounted for is only a problem for 1 person? A miracle!
---
Literally any potion.. was just the animation of using a pot while casting. Also shamans can fake cast with their hearthstone. Looks exact same as their heals.
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;This fix will go out soon as a hotfix.
---
I got a good news and...
---
&gt;it taking too long to drop combat, or having combat re-activated because your pet is getting attacked, and we’re still looking at those issues. We’re tracking a couple of leads there, but we haven’t got this bug in our sights yet, so it may take a bit more time to figure out what’s really going on here.
---
bad news.

Interesting... so my thinking was focus on elemental and then use melee to support when out of mana or between cd’s. Do you think my melee will be next to useless without good gear to support it?
---
*spams dungeons in classic*
---
I would add bagnon to this list. I don't know how you would manage inventory without out

Aren't there picture books in dire maul too? For class specific quests or something I think.

Rain is also not opaque white. And if it is... That's not water my dude.
---
Lol... I bought that arcanite rod recipe as soon as I had 2.2g at about lvl 15, hoping to score a few gold from it, and have yet to sell it as people list it for less than the vendor prices! It'll sit in my bank until my friend needs it I guess.
---
Yep. When I was playing CC was *mandatory*. Having a sub rogue and a mage in group made runs so much smoother. I remember when they put the patches in to make UBRS and scholo easier.. it was seriously a breeze to run through them compared to what it was. The trash mobs in Draks room in UBRS used to be a solid 10 minutes of clearing on its own, dropped down to "yeah just pull them".
---
I tanked a dungeon with 2 mages as dps. Literally every pull, there would need to be a 20 second drink break because they insisted on only doing flamestrikes, AE and blizzard, even if there were only 2 targets. Drained their mana completely.
---
Silver Dragon is the only one I know that is working for Classic so far!
---
It's not healthy the way Activision does it. And they're not alone in this. Every quarter they need to improve the last one. If not, it's a failure. And that failure always comes when they think like this. Increase profit always. It works to a point, and then it doesn't anymore. Then they fire people, look for easy short-term solutions, or just give the project up. 
---
Blizzard could easily have been going great with a certain amount of profit. Enough to pay expenses, and then some. But the need for higher profit keeps ruining that. Greed takes over. Stockholders make decisions.
---
It's been my experience as well, but it's not really hard for any role to get a group together now which is kind of the ideal scenario.
---
Especially true if you take the initiative to make the group yourself.
---
but not in the first week
---
Everyone needing on boe epic is pretty standard right?
---
Use frost shock for your burst and flame if the target will live more than a few seconds. It does more damage than earth shocks. Earth shock rank one is your interrupt however.
---
As a level 53 rogue I agree!!!
---
That attitude is way worse than the rush mentality IMO. It's extremely exhausting to play with people trying to "teach others a lesson" because someone didn't follow their orders. You're ruining your entire group's experience over your hurt ego.
---
didnt the blue post say 8% i thought
---
What’s the add-on that shows the information at the top of his UI?
---
Oops i just realised i misread your original reply.. i thought you said elemental the whole time and it’s worked well..
---
I get you 100% I’ve found elemental to be pretty tough early on.. I’m thinking of respeccing to enhancement to level now and then respec again later...
---
Bit tentative to respec though as it’s an increasing cost right?
---
Thanks a lot. I installed immersion and now I'm ruined too... RUINED!
---
Pretty sure the point was they didn’t care
---
Were they mind controlling ppl? I had an idea to do that.
---
Yeah, mechagon is *much* better
---
Druids are super rare on my server.
---
Did an MC Pug last night and we couldn't find a single druid.
---
Don’t play on streamer servers
---
I berate people who immediately open trade with me in instances with nothing to say.

They end up leaving without a single drop of water. Fuck them.
---
Two mains. 44 hunter and 40 warrior.  Two alts. 15 Rogue and 15 Druid.
---
🦀🦀🦀No GMs will respond to this thread. Blizzard is too scared to delete the mage class 🦀🦀🦀
---
For a start large scale world pvp doesn’t exist in retail secondly BG’s will more than likely have negative effect on wpvp just like it did in vanilla. Third, welcome to the classic experience lol
---
How do I move the bar that shows up at the bottom whenever you're doing something related to professions? i.e. skinning, using bandages, etc etc
---
Yeah but wouldn't this situation be exactly the same on any other server with this amount of people? I don't think it's the particular server that matters. I'm pretty sure all the servers would act like this, which is depressing.
---
I think 0.000001%, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Lots of undead for priests to shackle, plenty of demons for locks to control, freezing trap, entangling roots for melee trash,  etc. 
---
There's still plenty of CC, they just don't apply to all mobs equally across the board.
---
He's just beefin' around
---
It's almost definitely both, but yes it's multiboxing
---
i probably stole 10 stanleys when i was in hillsbrad. not sorry haha
---
Can i use the old game pass 10 day free trials to play classic wow?
---
You can flip a coin and land on heads 5 times in a row. Odds are still 50/50 on paper.
---
I experienced this first hand when I had to do 18-20 RFD runs to get a helmet that claimed to be a 30% drop rate. Ironically i came to terms I may not get it, and set out for 1 last run. That's when I got it.
---
I think the law of attraction works in opposite for video game based rng.
---
Kind of confused what you mean by this, i was trying to make a joke in my original reply and said fuck you because warlocks get their mount for free.
---
Right, because there was definitely no anger in your tone. This negativity is going to shorten your lifespan. Hope you learn how to get over yourself and lighten up on the vitriol. Peace.
---
You need 9% hit rating to not miss any yellow damage (ie abilities).
---
Your auto attacks will still miss until you reach something like 20%, which I believe is unattainable right now.
---
Gotta love the auto loot mastery &lt;3
---
&gt;If you play it right, Warrior is extremely easy to kill as a rogue 1v1
---
Thats because warriors arent geard right now. Later when all players have gear, a warrior will delete a rogue extremly fast if he doesnt bleed kite him.The problem is that you need to stay out of melee range but not to far away so he cant charge you. With the melee leeway in classic you have to stay most likley perfectly at 7 yards to not get hit or charged. Thats more or less impossible to do.
---
From my experience. 
---
Queing at 22:00 gmt +2 on Firemaw, queue of 3000 took me roughly 60 minutes. I also queued twice into a queue of 1000 and always got in after 15-20 mins. I'd say you should trust the written estimate time by Blizzard, as it's pretty accurate.
---
This is over thinking literally personified
---
I thought it would be a joke. I don’t know why, but I did
---
Given how it slopes down from Barrens, I’d say the valley floor might be around sea level or lower.
---
Lol what?
---
I spent several levels mage AoE grinding the humans there and every so often I'd accidentally tag a Stanley, nice boost to the XP

I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to do that, but for me, I won't be able to replace my current pole until I win a STV event, so there's little reason to mess with the macro. It'll always be returned to its previous bagslot when you swap back to your actual weapons (mine is bound to my mount key). You could, however, use the itemid's to further trim it down if you'd like:

Must be nice to like spending an extra 100g on a vendor pattern obtained via exploit
---
For the record, rogues and hunters are literally the only two classes that actually care about their tier sets (as far as DPS specs go). Every other DPS either uses no tier gear at all or just a few pieces for the lower set bonuses. So you’re going to deal with that playing as any class except hunter and rogue.

---
This guy gets it
---
The people who get stressed out tanking in retail are the same people who get stressed out tanking in classic. 
---
People bitch all the time on retail forums about feeling pushed by their group, random pugs expecting them to know the dungeon inside and out, people not doing mechanics and making their job harder, etc. 
---
People are anxious with tanking because all eyes are on you. You feel like you need to have full control of the run, and you feel like if you lose control that things are going to go to shit. 
---
So the tank loses aggro on mobs. They get super stressed out and they need to take back control. They berate their group members of vent via Reddit post. 
---
I honestly think that most of these stressed out tanks are retail players. Players who tried tanking in retail, and said ‘this hectic playstyle is too much for me. These pugs are so bad I can’t do anything and I’m not having fun.’ They thought that with classic, they’d get the super chill groups where everyone moves as slow as possible with zero stress.  
---
I don’t think that the stress comes from pugs playing badly or jumping the gun or whatever. It’s inherent to the role. Four people are waiting for you to lead them and it’s too much responsibility for most. If there’s a mistake, they’re frantically asking if it was their fault and ready to sling some blame, thinking back to a particularly negative experience months ago where someone said something mean. 
---
Literally everyone I know who is a competent retail tank has easily breezed through tanking classic dungeons. It doesn’t mean that they’ve had zero wipes, they just aren’t so insecure and stressed out when it happens. They’re not constantly playing out scenarios in their heads of the groups breaking up and people raging.
---
Cool.
---
It's fun, but most guilds will want their shammies to respec to heal if you're looking to raid
---
Is this satire?
---
At least at that point you have your 31point skill, thats the point when you finally feel like a real X whatever, shadowform, mortals strike etc.
---
Level 39 with only 50g feels bad :(
---
I’m loving the fact that you’re putting these out at the same rate I am completing these quests. Every time I see one I’m like “oh yeah I just handed that in last night.”
---
So long as it doesn't lead to the exclusion of any one healing class since there are a plethora of the "top tier" class!
---
Was so happy when I finally got it, hahah
---
If I get suspended will I gain rested XP?
---
I agree. Seems pretty static at this point.
---
...you could try Bagnon.
---
Isn’t that a character in Cats?
---
Also healers need Mana guys
---
And just like that his epic mount is funded!

Check out tradeskill manager
---
When you add one letter to a word and someone makes a reddit post about it
---
That makes me sad, i want this build to work from a fantasy perspective. I love the idea of a battle mage :’(
---
Depends on server. I was just trying to finish my quests for the elementals and it took me forever to tag enough mobs to then have enough drops to finish. Let alone farming them for money.
---
I got to level 16 on my warlock, was super happy with myself. nearly 2 Gold to my name. Mobs were getting a bit difficult but nothing i couldn't handle. My professions were nice and high. All in all i was very pleased with my progress. Out of curiosity i went to my trainer to see what level i would get Soulstones.
---
I had not got any skills since level 10. GOODBYE MONEY!!!  Silver lining was killing mobs became easier..
---
And this is free advertisement too
---
Thats a good one too
---
They stopped reporting actual numbers a few years ago because they knew the fans would use them as evidence that the game is going downhill (and rightfully so).
---
But yeah, official numbers would be nice.
---
Or that the information on wowhead is not particularly accurate:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9264/firebrand-pyromancer#drops:mode=normal:0-18-19+1](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=9264/firebrand-pyromancer#drops:mode=normal:0-18-19+1)   
---
Count: 12 of 153.  
---
I'd hardly consider that a large enough quantity of data to say "yes, it is an 8% drop rate".  
---
My assumption would be any of these epic items are closer to a 1%.
---
Thing is though, when you cc and ff the main target, they melt, and your tank takes barely any damage. Healers are 70%+ mana at the end and you can immediately mark and pull the next group.
---
It's a fucking great feeling rhythm once everyone gets in sync

46 main, 31 alt, 10 alt, 3 alt.

It’s in the settings, check use raid style party frames. Idk about soloing but for all parties that aren’t raids, yes.
---
Not really... wands aren’t really pvp items other than stat sticks
---
I’ll suck your ~~dick~~ soul !
---
Or have a wife who plays alongside you and friends with similar hobbies. 4 hours a day and 16 at the weekend is nothing compared to Joe Smoe watching netflix and youtube.
---
You do not get rested xp without active game time. So I doubt you'll get any while banned.
---
This is always the correct answer.  Those numbers are all user-generated by people who have used the mod that sends in your drops.  Loads of things skew those numbers.
---
Yes. You cannot automate clicking the bobber.
---
You don't have to target yourself to heal yourself.
---
Give me your name so I can make sure to gank you, i want to see your thoughts on why pvp shouldn’t be in the game
---
#NOCHANGES
---
Same, I have a 31, 23, 19, and 16. Feels like I’ve put a ton of time in (realistically I have about 4 days /played)
---
Why not just use the self cast key (alt by default) to cast on yourself?
---
The BS that comes from rogues on reddit is insane. So many are stuck in that weird mindset that rogues will win any 1v1 and are the kings of pvp. They do not realize that we play patch 1.12 and not on an older patch where rogues were actually OP.
---
Most of them never played classic on 1.12 and I guess arent even lvl 60 with gear.

Marksman hunter pets don’t hold agro, and you can’t not take agro from them when white crits will out agro them.  
---
Not to mention there are periods between growl ranks that your pet won’t hold agro.

At 34 my pet can barely pick up agro with growl rank 5, and he loses it with a single white crit.

“Flex on trash mobs”.  It’s called using you’re class properly.

Yeah it’s that fish, you have to cook it first tho

Wait berserker reduces threat gen too? I thought battle stance's reduced threat was its unique perk the way defensive has damage reduction &amp; aggro and berserker has increased crit chance

**Birthday problem**
---
In probability theory, the birthday problem or birthday paradox concerns the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are only 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions are based on the assumption that each day of the year (excluding February 29) is equally probable for a birthday.

I’m sorry but that’s hilarious bahaha

Have you played the game?

hmm so if I am subscribed and suspended I still don't get rested XP? if so it'd make sense to unsubscribe before my subscription renews in 2 days if I get suspended

So why complain about AOE runs then?

Stay in your lane bro

well that and BoE epics are just cool items (or a good chunk of gold) where the legiondaries had ur fucking class design inside them lmao i cant believe they thought that was a good idea

I had this exact moment when I started on a private server 2 years ago with some friends.

The issue was: Me, a dad, them being Bachelors I just could keep up. Then I felt I had to catch up and the slow progression made me give up at level 17 or so.

Being suspended counts as not having active gametime afaik.
---
50/50
---
Fun is obviously subjective.
---
Most players just want to get it over with and start raiding.
---
If you want to take 6 months to get to 60, be my guest, but most of us are already 60 and did it in less than 2 weeks.
---
I think endgame u can switch into a hybrid disc dps priest.(but way endgame when aq40/naxx hits)
---
Once your pet has aggro on whatever you want to pull back to the tank, either run to him yourself and pet follow or (much more likely) he's already tanking something else so just send your pet to attack that thing.  Whatever you had your pet pull aggro on will follow.
---
Nope a warrior in full gear, like endgame PvP set or T3 is really hard to kill as a rogue with equal gear.
---
You'll learn to manage your mana. Shadow priests are viable glass cannons 1v1. When you're facing multiple enemies, your true value shines as a utility dps. Shields, dots, dispels become more important than massive dps.
---
Basically, yeah.
---
That's great. The emote commands can be powerful, love when it works out like that.
---
That guy that said "you think you do but you don't" needs to be fired. Some blizz employees are so out of touch with their customers and what makes a game good, they should not be in the gaming industry at all. Example: everyone that has worked on Diablo 3 ever, Wow since Cata/Pandas.
---
Dude I didn't get it either until I just did some spellcleave SM Cath (as the priest)... It's insane. I think 5 total pulls. Maybe hit 10 minutes total. Each time we did the last pull including the boss and every bit of trash inside.
---
&gt; Sounds like an easy way to ~~go oom after every pull~~ body pull more shit into your melee range because it respawned up your ass.
---
Watch it ACTUALLY be a COD to buy it back for 40g xD
---
It's just popular to hate on the "spellcleave meta" right now and whatever classes that means.
---
I regularly have tanks saying how much they appreciate my frost novas timed so they don't die and being able to keep multiple melee mobs occupied so they do no damage to anyone at all. But all mages are assholes and tanks don't appreciate AoE, so I must be a trash zooming liar.
---
Yeah, it's a bit of a rocky start. We've had some of the same issues in our friends group. We swapped servers to avoid it, but someone who came really late still got shafted. 
---
Try and log in and create characters at a time when they are no queues. This should solve the issue of getting pushed to the back.
---
Then see if you (and your friends) can transfer to a lower pop realm later.
---
Yours isn’t working and you’re arguing with him.
---
poly how? You'll get pummelled and charged and then feared.
---
Its an intimidation tactic that gives +5% threat
---
This isnt just the AH though. This is human nature with supply and demand. I'm not robbing myself of any hypothetical profit, I'm guaranteeing myself nearly exact profit now, by doing 1c under the guy before me. 
---
If an item is so easily obtained that this trend continues forever, then eventually the item wont be worth selling on AH. Which means it's too easily obtainable anyway. 
---
The only way value will go up, is if people stop selling it entirely. That creates a lack of supply and if the demand stays constant, its value will rise.
---
Economics 101.
---
Once your pet has aggro on the loose mob, you just tab back to the pack and have it attack another target. The pet will go after the new target and the mob will follow which will put it back within range of the tank.
---
Good tips here
---
You realize that CoC/AE on 30 mobs has way higher DPME than frostbolt on 1, right? That is the metric by which you should judge drink time. There's a reason all of the world first dungeon spammers were doing AoE and not ST, it's not secretly slower (assuming you can execute it properly, which is much harder than a ST group).
---
Are they actually a thing? Legit question
---
Install a KkthnxUI\_Classic from twitch/curse/github and you dont need a half of these addons.
---
Im not saying it's not good, it's just not necessary.  You can still get to the ideal mark at 308 weapon skill without it or at least the 305.  There is no replacement for stoneform or fw.
---
Not 100% sure but it's probably a very solid Twink necklace. If you hold onto it until BGs it would probably be worth 30+g
---
Am I the only one that interprets this as the retail guy being sick of classic wow gurus lecturing him about how to enjoy classic when he whines the slightest amount, and logs off because he got annoyed by being talked down to?
---
Just dont heal them.. so many healers needs to learn this. Just dont heal them.
---
They'll first aid, eat and drain life.
---
I don’t mean ONLY the elementals, the tigers and coyotes in Badlands have great loot tables as well, plenty of grays that vendor well and the mobs are abundant.
---

---
Recommend checking your AH for prices as they aren't shared across servers.
---
That does not make the elvui version worse?
---
Is this reddit logic? lol
---
Edit: Let me clarify on how you're objectively wrong: the entire addon does not work for me, as I have stated, I then linked an alternate version (which also doesn't work, which I have stated) and you then tell me that, in general, yours(which doesn't work for me) works in GENERAL and the one I linked(which works for thousands fo people, my friend included who told me about the addon i nthe first place) does not.
---
The mind gymnastics you have to do to not logically process a statement is incredible :-D
---
Imma just throw out 1 in 20000 chance or .005% chance.
---
I’m no mathematician but it just sounds right to me.
---
Posture check
---
I mean if you were invested enough in observing the people who were using these exploits before they got banned, you would know where to find out about the results of the band and their feedback. As it is, people are probably talking about it on every forum as well as in-game, you just have to put in the effort to look
---
It's the same case as with Bioware. They're just the shambling host body for their respective parasites.
---
But I knew exactly what I was doing and you took the bait. I'm very satisfied with the outcome
---
Can I get that macro?
---
I have had groups with all three healers and all three tanks. As long as you're not trying to join some top-tier guild, you'll be fine.

It's kind of surprising how Madonna has all but disappeared from public consciousness. If we start thinking about iconic songs from the 80s that still get featured in today's movies/tv/commercials, none of them belong to her.
---
yeah probably, ive had two savage glad chains drop too
---
You are correct lol lfr is way harder.
---
This is great
---
I pull with aimed shots
---
This happens to players as well.
---
This is super useful thanks!
---
Forgive my confusion, but what does this macro do that makes it so much better than clicking the fishing button (dragged onto bar) and then clicking the bobber and repeat?
---
I haven't fished in classic yet, only retail.
---
I mean, it's right there in front of you. Unedited. Still working. You bit the bait, guess you aren't the expert troll spotter you feel like you are
---
What server?
---
Main 60 Arms Warrior 300 Black Smithing and Engineering, 1st Alt 40 Frost Mage 250 Tailoring 250 Enchanting, 2nd Alt 28 BM Hunter  150 Skinning 150 Herbalism and I am going to PvP with all of them.
---
I’ve always wondered why this is a thing. Anyone know the actual reason behind the restriction?
---
My memory is fuzzy but in BC yeah there was definitely a type of token system for completing dungeons and if you accumulate enough you could trade them in for epic gear pieces.
---
[Armor tokens](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Currency#Armor_tokens) were one, but they had a different type for heroic dungeons too.
---
That, my friend, is super dope - thanks for letting me know! I'll take a look when dorking around tonight!
---
Just FYI It's Tarren Mill.  Has nothing to do with the moo men.
---
You basically want to be within 3 levels of each other. At a stretch, you want the mobs you're killing to not be grey for either of you. 
---
This is what I do in a similar situation to you (playing with my friend who can't play as much):
---
-I have one character that I only play when he is on. As a result, we're always at the same level. Sometimes I do a bit of catch up if he has played a bit without me. 
---
-I have a second character that I play whenever he isn't on.
---
It's the opposite of what you're doing basically, but it means it is a lot easier to stay at similar/same level.
---
That is the only way you can snatch good AOE threat on the pull, but it’s a bit sketchy. Sweeping strikes takes all of your rage, so if you run with just the rage from charge, you’re in zerk stance with no rage to WW until you get hit properly or crit a big auto. Generally it works, I’m tanking trash like this too.
---
Optimal opener is: zerk stance w/ 2h, zerk rage, battle stance, charge, bloodrage, sweeping strikes, zerk stance, whirlwind, def stance with 1h/shield, demo shout, battle shout, sunder/block/revenge etc
---
WTB a few more fingers/tentacles tbh.
---
I have a buddy that farms this way more than me, and he consistently gets 1 - 2 every hour. 
---
There simply has to be something more at play here because the math doesn't add up.
---
Hopefully it will serve as a wake up call to game developers.  It's not nostalgia.  We do know what we want.  You don't see our money otherwise.

Lmao. I’ve been playing WoW since I was 19 (I’m 33 now). I know how it works. I just hadn’t had one drop for me (tho in the midst of all this, one did). I’ll be okay, I promise.

Have you seen the drop rate for it?

---
Yes it is a fix, I've just installed bootcamp on my 2012 pro and it runs flawlessly
---
Very true on all counts. Plus, like warlocks, druid [healing] gear scales *insanely* well. On pservers, druids were pushing the tops of the charts on HPS near the end of Naxx
---
Give it the true mage challenge and make a talk to text for your spells so to cast frostbolt, you have to actually say, "Frostbolt"
---
Is there an addon that lets you look up stuff in your bags by name like you can in retail?
---
I’ve had worse
---
At least one druid did complete Sulfuras in Vanilla, the way to do it is to be the Guild Leader and then have your whole guild re-form without you afterwards.
---
I also have a few lvl 1-10 Shamans on different servers. All of my toons are Horde
---
Any raid team worth its salt has a feral tank.

---
Hey man, the Barrens is at least 8 hours of just running, lol
---
Well you should be going to stranglethorn vale soon. Your hatred for the opposing faction should start soon.
---
i dont get it, its worked fine for me
---
Yeah, it is exactly that. Everyone is just salty over mages AoE farming their quest mobs and not being invited to 4 mage groups so it's fun to make up mage hate like this.
---
How did he get up the elevator?
---
Honestly I don’t think it’s out of the question. Activison-Blizzard as a company really needs another grand slam because they’ve not been doing super well these past few years and their stock has reflected that. Classics release helped Blizzard out of a slight slump as it being a moderately successful hit at launch but they could just keep what’s good going and make Classic+. I could see that drawing a good portion of the subscribers back to stay longer term (more so than TBC). It’s all about subs with Activison Blizzard and I think them going classic rewarded them decently
---
so vast
---
Hold on to it until battlegrounds open then sell, you’ll make some nice bank. 
---
FYI: Rouge is red in French, I believe the word that you and so many others are looking for is Rogue.
---
Ok so I am not crazy..  Everyone kept saying it was my fault I must have agreed them

No, I overshare. Sorry that you felt the need to reply to my comment...oh wait, you did what I did. You replied to a comment that wasn't directed to you, see how that works?

Sorry that you felt the need to reply to a comment online when it means nothing to you even though I do it often.

I look back every few months to see how much worse the game is getting with every update
---
It's clearly an end of life game that they're just using to squeeze the whales for everything they have before they dissolve the game entirely
---
What a fucking bunch of cowards the jagex staff are that they go radio fucking silence whenever the community asks them to respond to the very valid mtx criticism
---
Jagex deserves to go out of business because of what they did to rs3
---
And they should just hand osrs to someone else rather than cling to it for good pr.
---
16 hours a day on every weekend since launch. Not hard? Are you listening to yourself?
---
There's nothing wrong with what you said. It's the "classic is about the journey comment" I agree with you, but it's not like that for everyone. Handwaving everyone whose only interest is in end game content to the toxic part of streamer culture IS elitist. Streamers can be a bad influence but not all streamers are bad, not everyone who plays classic is doing it for the journey. It's not that hard to understand.
---
I'm in the 40s now. As a shaman it is absolute garbage. It takes forever. This has also todo with the fact that the awesome move an enhancement gets at level 40 is just like earthshock. So Elemental becomes the way and I'm drinking every third mob now. 
---
If I wouldn't be leeching a ton of water from mages, I'd be at 0 Gold before I reach level 50.

How does one achieve this glory?

Haha. Yeah say goodbye to the hype over the next couple months.

---
Is there any kind of secret water farming technique besides mage water and morning glory dew? I know sagefish can give you health and mana, but it's lower level. I want to spec elemental/resto shaman at 60 so I'll be chugging all the time.
---
Small price to pay for the smiting of your enemies :)
---
I learned the bad direction language while playing Morrowind.
---
Man I feel that good imagery.
---
That I don’t want to spend money on the AH for an item I will significantly out-level very quickly?  I mean, it’s personal preference, tbh. I personally don’t wanna.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Okay
---
I was waiting for someone to ninja. Was glad it didn’t happens. Great guild mates there 🤘🏻
---
There’s addons floating around that has the maps, mind you the character arrow isn’t there though
---
Can't speak to others experiences but, this quest was not bugged for our raid, it just took a really long time. It's decent rep while you wait.
---
Please share your wisdom
---
Are you sure about the bag space counter? Can't see the feature anywhere
---
I guarantee the next few years will be filled with Classic ReReleases, TBC and Wrath for sure will be making appearances. And I will also bet that TBC and Wrath will be box sets that you purchase. The classic trial showed a clear desire for a rerelease of the old content, they can throw a $60 price point on TBC and Wrath and make silly profit, as well as keep the subscriber numbers inflated for the next few years.
---
All in all, buy ACTI stock.
---
It really is. 
---
16 characters at 60 with a very impressive leveling time of 5 days /played would be 80 days /played. 
---
That’s 3 hours a day for 640 days. Almost two years. 2 hours a day for almost 3 years. 
---
That’s a lot time.
---
The odds of it dropping are probably about 1% 
---
And even doing 100 runs doesn't guarantee you would get one
---
At a 1% chance drop rate if you killed 100 mobs who could drop it you still only have a 63.4% chance of finding at least one. 
---
If it was a 5% chance of it dropping that means the odds of getting it in 100 chances are 99.4% which are good but there is still a chance of you being unlucky
---
It wasn't a meteor that killed off all the dinosaurs. It was the Devilsaur Mafia.
---
This is exactly what he is talking about though. The fights are 15-20 seconds if you stop clowning around. Maybe garr is a bit longer due to some shenanigans with adds.
---
This translates into trash and an entire run being done in 30 minutes or less.
---
Then depending on phase. You hit bwl and then onyxia and you are done your weekly raids so u can pvp or do other things with your life. Or you can do it your way which is totally fine is that is the kind of playing you want.
---
Its personal preference imo.
---
Around the same. You can't imagine the number of players I encountered coming from private servers.
---
"y-you think you do, but y-you don't"
---
Yes I literally saw it for a he first time last night and was confused as to why I had never seen that mob before

And that was the easy nerfed rep grind

Im just happy thinking of them getting to 60 and realizing no group wants them because there are 30000 better mages already.
---
Make sure you're specced as Marksmen and run high level dungeons with your pet on passive.
---
Yeah I remember taking an hour for SM cath, even without aoe groups i was doing it in like..15-20 now.

Pacing is way faster

Currently level 39 warrior. Only have rank 1 of most abilities. Sunder, demo, battleshout, and sometimes rend are all I buy and use until whirlwind. I'd have zero gold otherwise. Overpower was my best friend for a long time

Oh man! That's probably one of the nicest things someone's done for me.. just shows how amazing this community really is! I really dont know what to say but thank you so very much. Even just the thought is more then enough
---
I actually never have my pet on aggressive, and only really consider rolling need if it has more agility or DPS than what I have, which doesn’t happen too often. Think I might just be unlucky with drops, but am still lvl 26
---
Always remember the shitheads are the loudest ones in the room. Read through the comments in this thread if you want some of your faith restored. 1.4k comments and a shit ton of them are people agreeing with OP.

Sounds like you either don't want to actually play the game or need to reroll.

Imagine having family and friends that care about you enough that they actually want to check and make sure your still alive. The only person that checks on me is my mother and a simple text message of "still alive" every few days is enough for her.

---
In my opinion, WoW is a social game. Join a guild and chat with people on Discord. Break up the monotony with dungeon runs.
---
Leveling an alt temporarily could be a nice change of pace then come back to your main.
---
I guess it depends what you're talking about really. If it means leading the dungeon and how many mobs are pulled etc that's tanks job and healer. But you are right of course, it isnt that DPS don't know what theyre talking about.

Go run dungeons?  Join the LookingForGroup and answer anyone looking for DPS for a dungeon at your level.

---
Dps Shaman is currently the lowest dps in the game, even below Feral Druids and Retribution Paladins. Both of these are considered meme specs so that will give you an idea of how well received a non restoration Shaman spec will be. 
---
If you want to raid seriously then you’re going to have to respec restoration or find a guild who will let you raid as enhancement to swing a Nightfall Axe for the magic damage debuff.

I got it like two months ago and ranged characters (my main is a necro) get such a nice boon from looting as soon as the mob dies regardless of range lol

It's going with blacksmithing since my main is an engineer, so I have plenty of leftover ore/stone incidentally. Intent is to just instance hop once I level a bit further rather than solo questing, as I did that on my main.

Use this macro as your soul shard skill:
---
\#showtooltip Drain Soul  
---
/cast Drain Soul(Rank 1)  
---
/run PickupContainerItem(4,Y) DeleteCursorItem()
---
The Y is the number of slots your Soul pouch has, and the number 4 is the bag slot you have your Soul pouch in...just put it in the very left one and it's 4.  The macro casts drain soul and deletes the last soul shard in your bag.

Elvui provides pretty much the majority of these addons listed above itself, including what youre asking
---
Fire vs Frost Mage for solo PvE (not dungeons; mostly open-world/questing)?
---
I never played a Frost mage on Retail, but have one at level 9 on Classic so far. Doesn't seem too exciting, but maybe it'll pick up later on with more spells? Seems like I'm just spamming frost bolt until the thing dies, and I imagine I'd be using Blizzard for AoE once I get it.
---
I've played a Fire mage on Retail and loved how spells would proc and spreading some burning DoT; I guess it could be described as fast-paced chaos? I liked Fury warriors on Retail for the same reason. Do Fire mages work in a similar way on Classic as they do on Retail?
---
Damn... i want a battle mage!! :’(
---
You can spam BRD and should. I'm sure there's at least one piece of pre raid bis for you there.

Im new to the game in general and im a druid so id also like to know lmao

I didn't get mine till 43. Like real life, feels good not being in debt.

Won’t appear above your teammate, it will appear above your own head. Pretty annoying

Did you open the file for the addon to see if there’s a readme? A lot of the time they will have a text file that lists commands for the addon.
---
Has anyone come up with a portmanteau to describe hated mages yet?
---
I can't think of anything that'll top "Huntard".
---
edit: u/HazelCheese came up with "Frostard", I'll go with that.
---
u are a pussy
---
You look like Mary Poppins!
---
Never stop.
---
It’s perfect. You can also add players to a kill list so the addon will tell you if they are nearby, so no macro spam for you.
---
Both of the mentioned sources used talk about importance of farming that gnomeregan pummeler. They do that because threat IS an issue when maintanking. Which is why I thought I was lucky to get [Mask of the Unforgiven](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13404/mask-of-the-unforgiven). Yet one source puts that as bis, and other claims [Bone Ring Helm](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=14539) is superior. I feel like both have the same intent in making you the best tank but it's odd why half of the items are different.

"Know how to turn off growl but also how to turn it back on and  use my pet to dash towards,  taunt, and  intimidate the extra two mobs that the mage just pulled onto the healer and save the group from a wipe"

Because there is basically no reason to be. You can tank without talenting into Protection. As an example, pretty much every top end tank at this point will be dps spec (or hybrid at least) and switching between dps weapons and sword and board depending on the fight/incoming damage - this is upto and including tanking Naxx raid bosses, so low level dungeons you can very easily do as a mixed build and you won't be gimping yourself even further for when you're questing alone.
---
The jealousy is real

Iv been snapping screens my whole adventure as well. Itll be a fun look back once I'm 60.
---
Edit: years old.
---
If you don’t have a target it stops shooting.
---
Benediction x2 here
---
Yeah I'm nearly maxed as a mage and I've been in many AoE ("spellcleave") groups and they're *very* hit or miss. You either clear everything super quickly and it's fun, each of the mages knows when to time their novas, the tanks know how to pull, etc..
---
Or it goes terribly wrong and there's wipe after wipe.
---
When it does go well though, it's really nice.

How the hell is that what lead to retail. That is just a blanket argument ender everyone on this sub uses no matter the situation.

And BRD spellcleave arena runs for a few BiS pieces for mage too. Honestly I'm a fan of AoE groups, when everyone is competent.
---
A friend rolled and won both of these in 1 raid a couple of days ago, im still slightly salty

Wouldn't it be a (1/100)^2 chance for them to roll the same number, and then [(1/100)^2]^2 or (1/100)^4 for It to happen twice in succession?

You have a voidwalker with taunt, so why use fear here?

You know your tank needs the hits to generate their rage to actually tank...so stop doing this.

There was an addon I really liked as a mage playing private servers called “Dr Damage” haven’t been able to find it since playing classic. Anyone know what I’m talking about/have any leads?
---
What is the census for lv 10+? Anything below 10 has a good chance of being a bank alt.
---
Insert "supervisors ire"
---
What was that lol
---
&gt;There's a large spike at 40, and then a sharp drop off, indicating possibly reaching the 'mount' goal and bailing, or insufficient funds to purchase might throw people into a ragequit.
---
leveling past 40 is a difficulty increase and 44 is the actual halfway point for xp required. this just means people are idiots and level slowly, nothing more
---
&gt;There is no bellcurve in the stats. There's no leveling 'pack'. Apart from the level 40 spike

in closing you just contradict yourself repeatedly and have produced a walltext for no reason

No good tanks would be crying on reddit. Just own up to you being bad.

Lack of hotkeys, everything left on auto cast (especially taunt), pet left on defensive or aggressive. I’m a tank and 4 out of every 5 hunters I’ve ran with does pretty much all of those things.

---
Managing the churn is how you end up with perpetually underskilled workers, as well as meaning you need a dedicated trainer/babysitter all the time.
---
Our goal was to get some people in who would basically be able to be left to their own devices after a few months of training so that they weren't constantly having to bring in senior staff to fix everything.
---
As an almost 60 rogue, that really doesn’t do much. Every single group is looking for a tank, just like 15 years ago.
---
Shadow or holy are much easier than disc for fury but yes, the damage output is very, very high vs cloth and fury warriors can go fear immune for 40 seconds.
---
It's actually easier for fury than arms before high tier raiding gear holy, at which point you need MS to really have a shot.
---
Hope you're kidding. Anyway if you're not, just know that the picture makes up for the rolls you rarely see.
---
I don't think I've ever met anyone who played Vanilla in depth that preferred anything past BC.
---
This may be classic but this aint the same blizzard from 2004
---
It's the ninjas cutting onion.
---
The first week of classic I was handing out linen bags to new characters in Northshire Abbey. Everyone was super thankful since bag space sucks on new characters
---
Of course I had one guy who kept bugging me for more and I would say "sorry 1 per person"
---
To which his response was "I'll just make another character then so just give me the bag..."
---
Some people man
---
I must be missing something, that’s 226%.
---
That was a mage getting obliterated by a warrior
---
Ret aoe tank, it really works.
---
Yo what that's awesome! Is the channel just /uber? I'm on grob and would love to use this
---
It's funny because my guilds always seem to have a ton of female Tauren. Personally it's kind of surprising since male Tauren look so bad in everything except Paladin sets.
---
Exactly how I feel... but after work and the kids are asleep... then I escape... into my dinning room because my office was turned into the baby room... but when I get those few hours on the computer where I eat, man... lol
---
1 silver something
---
It's way less common in retail. I have no idea why classic brings the noobs out.
---
Glad I made this pally an officer.
---
Firelash EU?
---
Idk about them, but im 60 and have loved leveling, but my main criticism is find a groups without a guild full of 60s is very painful. It makes me want to not play sometimes because i dont want to waste 45 minutes spamming chat.
---
I like him. I’m glad you did too. He’s pretty chill.
---
Wtf is "dungeon fighter online" and why is it the most popular game??
---
And this: https://youtu.be/6oJ09dboUTk
---
i definitely still had a target.
---
He also isn't describing the scenario at all.  What is he even trying to do? Mouse over something while having a target and switch targets and keep wanding?  Mouse over a target, shoot at it while maintaining another target?  There's also no condition there for shooting at a target without having a mousover and without having shift used.
---
Hey that's alright man warriors don't even have any abilities before level 36 anyway don't worry about it
---
That's been patched, you only get XP per mob once. So afrer you wipe the entire room once you get nothing without resetting.
---
Put it this way, ive paid 15 a month for 15 years. If I'm punished for reporting someone else, I'm gonna be writing emails.
---
Yeah i guess we should wait for the trinkets
---
Blame the cleave meta.  As a Rogue I only pull threat when I can handle it without needing heals and let the healer know they don't need to heal meif I do take enough damage to be a concern since I have heal pots for days from pickpocket macroed openers.  
---
I notice mages locks and warrior dps have 0 regard for threat and group resources and are clueless that they're actually slowing things down while also making the rest of the group miserable.
---
&gt; spent all his money
---
I read here he got gifted like 1k gold or even more? barely his gold is it?
---
How to get pet training points? 
---
My cat is level 6 best friend and i didn't know about this till i was 30 but I bought the upgrades from the pet trainer but didn't know i needed to train them with the ability after. I upgraded what i could and learned i needed pet training points. But im not getting any. I've been at 15 pet training points for the past day and a half. I read that i have to keep the pet well fed which is not been a problem. I'm feeding my cat the highest level food i can get as i go and he's been green for the majority of my time. Other than when it dies and i have to revive, i just heal it and feed it. Idk what to do. I have so many things i need to train him on now im just wasting money learning it from the pet trainer. 
---
Do i need to feed him raw food? Do i need to be attacking and killing mobs at my level? Do i need to feed him higher leveled food? Please give me a straight answer!
---
World seems to be way more popular than lookingforgroup
---
1/100 * 1/100 = .0001
---
Let me know how melle cleevse go in Cath when you pull rooms at a time.
---
The point of spell cleave is that you kite and dont take too much damage, youre meant to blast them from outaide their range.
---
lol been doing that for 10+ years. Used to set up a few tvs and we would all play wow at a buddies house.
---
Why do you want our opinion? You’re the one that has to stare at this for hours. 
---
For what it’s worth, I’ve used both and like both. SUF is probably a bit more minimalist but I like the way ZPerl does things. 
---
I’ve been using SUF for a while and switched back to ZPerl today. Haven’t played with it long enough to decide on it, but I think I prefer ZPerl overall for whatever reason.
---
Not everything that dies has loot.
---
Mate, as a fellow hunter, even though we mainly use range, you still need to train your melee!
---
This is the lowest tier bait I've seen in a long time.
---
the census data excludes lower than 6 as the vast majority of bank alts are lvl 5 for DEing or tradeskills. 
---
As i said in the post, 11-21 is the biggest bracket, with consistent character numbers around ~100,000
---
I don't know about this one to be honest. Putting NPCs there would just encourage people to get up there because it almost seems encouraged at that point. Even if Blizzard did put it in, would they allow roof use at that point? I mean if they put a strong NPC up there, surely it should be okay to be up there?
---
EDIT: So my friend suggested kill mechanics, and I figured why not specify it being a combat thing. An instakill "guardian" that reacts to attacks.
---
Leatrix Maps is great. It was broken for the first week or so, but it all works perfectly now. The whole map is revealed (with darkening showing you where to explore) and the entrances to dungeons, flightpaths and boat docks are all marked. No more "wait, is this the boat to Auberdine?"
---
You should look up a leveling guide like [https://www.joanasworld.com](https://www.joanasworld.com/) \- I find it sometimes helps and is more fun to have a bit of direction as well as helping you progress much faster than you otherwise would.
---
This right here is what I was referring too. Sure, you might take a bear, a cat, and a resto for all the various utility and just providing buffs, but they're not competitive number's wise, and you only truly need one of them to keep mark up.
---
Clearly other people disagree with me, and I'm by no means saying druids won't get to raid, but they're also simply not a class you actively seek out more than one of unless you just really want extra utility.
---
I don't think you make a very good point, why are you being so negative about his summary of the data?
---
"People are idiots and level slowly".
---
People have lives, and level slowly.
---
Log off bro.
---
So for me the it the opposite. Been playing this game since the beginning like everyone else and about TBC and wrath is when I started to become a good player. I played a fire mage and elemental shaman and I started to realize you didn’t have to have a proper tank, that the meta at the time of just slowly pulling and ccing was actually slower and less fun. 
---
I started to play a warrior tank with some friends and I found myself able to do absurd things with shock wave, grenades and slow kiting. Tanking dungeons ina chaotic and high risk high reward way is like a mix of pvp and pve. I wish more people would come to this realization instead of the “holy trinity” method that’s been around for so long. 
---
For the record I play elemental shaman at 60 now and I love being dps, tank and off healing all at the same time. It’s possible, people just have to let go of their pre conceived notions and essentially learn to play better.
---
N i c e g a m e
---
Nah, it's just making these posts are easy karma.
---
15 years ago I played Hunter and I was a complete huntard. I've made it my goal to play classic as Hunter was meant to be played, so I've gone and done my research. 
---
I'm yet to see a mage best me on overall damage done in SM. I'd put this down to most mages thinking that if they pull aggro it's because the tank is bad. 
---
Also the amount of mages losing to me in world PvP is a good indicator of who the new huntards are (งツ)ว
---
Why aren't these in the Twitch app?  How am I supposed to keep them updated if they're not there?
---
Edit - I see, he spelled most of them wrong.  Most of them don't have spaces.
---
so basically, I was dotting up a single target. not in combat with any other mobs, not mousing over anything else. I would put my warlock dots up and then click the macro to shoot. It would fire once then cancel.
---
As a rogue I feel this, it's basically impossible to find dungeon groups, and most times the aoe cleave comps will wipe on a bad pull and end up taking longer than standard comps
---
I saw this the other day too and my jaw dropped reading it. Didn’t expect it at all.
---
Is there an addon that does dismounting in a "smart" way? Like, with that option turned on, if I accidentally press an attack button without a target I'll still get put on my ass. In retail, it just tells you there's no target.
---
40 is when it really takes off as a Warrior. You finally have a high damage nuke (MS, BT) and finally have movement speed when you get your mount. It's smooth sailing from there.
---
Oh... and sunder is not the magic solution to all problems. Its great. Its my favorite classic ability. But it does 0 damage .... and sundering a mage is a lot like pistol whipping a blind kid... its funny the first 20 times... but after that ... its just sad... and it doesnt help you win.
---
I've leveled one of every allied race for the transmog and hit 60 in classic the other day in 11 days 4 hours played. 
---
It was just as easy in classic as I remember in 2006 and just as easy as retail. It just took a little longer and knowing which dungeons to hit up for gear. 
---
The only difference between the 2 is that when youre at 60 you are done. If you didnt have to grind all 120 levels to play end game content then nobody would need group finder or heirlooms to make it bearable.
---
Warlocks, yo
---
My suggestions would be
---
[**https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags**](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/adibags) **- best bag addon imo for classic or retail.**
---
[**https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn**](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn) **- This is more of hopeful one right now as the classic version isn't up to par with retail.**
---
[**https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic**](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus-classic) **- does a lot of some the other addons you have on there.**
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlaslootclassic) \- I would also suggest the map module addon for it.  Nice to find you way through a dungeon like WC sometimes.
---
I caused a wipe in my first tanking attempt (Deadmines). Got told it wasn't my fault. Still felt like a shit tank.  
---
I got killed tanking Van Cleef on my second attempt at tanking and the healer told it wasn't my fault. Still blamed myself and felt like a shit tank.  
---
Does it always feel like the weight of the entire run is our burden alone? I think I learned a lot from those two runs but it's rough to feel like I let everyone down and wasted their time.  
---
Not saying I hated it mind you. Actually find it quite enjoyable.
---
why in gods green earth would you use \ over /
---
Memory is failing me, is there anything that’s actually useful locked behind rep?
---
Yah, then they stripped that out and gave it too Worgen years later instead of the badass boar mount they were supposed to get. Then the boar mount came out in Draenor where the faction mount for laughing skulls is in the store.
---
Understood, thank you.
---
Yo that homie droppin like 600xp every time I kill him. I’ll take that deal any day of the week
---
You mean a dual wield fury tank?  If we are getting to the best of the best that is.
---
It's extremely frustrating for me as a Mage because I would absolutely love to go moderate. Flamestrike, fireballs, etc and then repeat. But every group I go in seems to lose their heads unless I specifically go ape-shit with my aoe, which often puts me OOM about 10 seconds in leaving my protection, and huge aggro, to the ability of my group - who often don't care at all. I hate it.
---
Retail player here. Started in MoP. My hunter is about 26 and I’m having fun. Kinda like the slower pace. I’m seeing things in classic that make me go “that’s cool, why did they take that out?” And also things that make me go “thank god we don’t have to deal with that anymore in live”. I see the benefits to both and think the two can sit besides each other as separate games well.
---
As someone who only wanted to run it for quests and had no plans to rerun for loot i looked for groups who were 44+
---
I was a 44 priest. The final boss is a tough one. If a dps is lower than 42 they will probably not be very helpful. 
---
If I was trying to run it a bunch of times for loot I would settle on 42+ for everyone.
---
Is this how it actually works???
---
You got a rade mount!
---
Abacus and sock puppets.
---
Thanks man, back to camping out the Field of Giants I go lmao
---
After a few tries I killed one on a 52 warlock, but if anything much went wrong I was hosed.
---
I see you’re complaints about finding a group, but have you tired starting your own? There are other classes and players out there that won’t want, or can’t get into, the AOE groups.
---
I don't really understand the need to aoe lvl so quickly. If you're not familiar with late game raids in classic... mages are there for portals, water, polymorph &amp; to take all the mage specific loot, other than that they are possibly the worst dps late game (from my vanilla mage experience) 
---
Just enjoy the ride &amp; get familiar with proper mage rotations, who am I kidding go fire/arcane spec and have a bit of fun.
---
Bear is good IF your dps dont suck.  If you have good dps then the better threat of druid is better.
---
For 5 minutes*
---
completely reasonable. ignoring it takes less effort that it would to disable it
---
Is it better to stack strength or agi while leveling as feral (cat) druid? Does the same answer hold true at 60/world pvp?
---
About 3 in 1000
---
&gt;	probability of any two members of a 5-man rolling the same: 
---
&gt;100/100 * 99/100 * 98/100 * 99/100 * 98/100 ~= 90.3% chance to not happen, therefore 9.7% chance to happen.  
---
&gt;Of the remaining three members: 100/100 * 99/100 * 98/100 ~= 97% chance to not happen, therefore 3% chance to happen.
---
&gt;	combining these two events: 9.7% * 3% ~= 0.0029, i.e. ~0.3%

---
I was so confused when I saw this thing!
---
Whenever I told players that part of the reason they grew to dislike retail was because of how much they chose to play and burn themselves out, so many of them always got super defensive insisting it was only blizzards fault. Maybe this time around they will be able to take a little more responsibility for how much they choose to play.
---
TSM does this
---
I was leveling engineering on my hunter and made an inventory full of Mechanical Squirrels. I posted up as a guard outside of Org and stopped the new players that came in. 
---
"Hello, can you hold up a minute?"
---
"Hey what's up?"
---
"I see you're headed into Org. Where is your squirrel?"
---
"My what?"
---
"Your squirrel?"

"I don't have a squirrel"

---
Neither your sample size nor wowheads or your buddies are even close to big enough. If the guessed drop rate is somewhere between 0.1 and 20%, you would need hundreds of kills to pinpoint it.
---
I know there is a formula to calcuate the amount of kills if you want a +-0.1% accuracy with 95% certainty but Im too lazy to look it up.
---
I tanked every dungeon I did so far myself with a 2h. Always gave healers a heads up because  once saw one angrily typing in global chat about having a tank without a shield. Not a single healer complained about it, and since I always have a shield +1h ready, I can still swap for hard hitting bosses and use the Shield block, and use Shield Wall if someone accidentally pulls a big group. Additionally, using a 2h gives you higher threat as far as I notice (Obviously through higher damage)
---
And the satisfaction of preparing rage from a previous pull &amp; bloodrage, then charging in, activating Cleave, Sweeping Strikes (Which makes cleave proc it if you do it fast enough), and inmediatly going to a whirlwind. More often then not I can almost (never fully) hold aggro against a mage going all out afterwards.
---
Nah youre completely wrong there, classic eliteists are typically the min maxers
---
They felt alone during the beta because the capacity of each layer was drastically reduced for testing purposes. Blizzard was most likely just clarifying that it wasn't going to be the case for launch and matters weren't going to feel empty. They've also said that layers are meant to be something you join when you log in and then for the duration of the session you're in that same layer, seeing the same players running around the same zones as you. The only way to change layers is to join a party or maybe change continents, maybe with the exception of layers being destroyed if they're dynamically managed. But that would only happen late at night when barely anybody is online.
---
"This oath is accepted!"
---
It's close to as good as Barman Shanker I think.  Higher DPS w/ the AP particularly, about 2 higher total.  With the AP advantage the damage range is effectively ~3.5 higher.  So 50.5.5-91.5 which is less than Barman's 51-95.
---
Overall they will overall be about the same.
---
&gt;Is that intended or a side effect of being West coast on an East coast server?
---
I have no idea, but it might.  I find that I sometimes have to loot the body twice and sometimes don't.  Either way, it is a small price to pay for how much gold it brings in
---
default classic settings (3 on the slider)
---
I'm assuming he is talking about me, and that is not even close to what I said at all. I said that water is free to make and I give it freely to anyone who wants it. I do not agree that you are entitled to free portals though. If you have a Mage that is nice enough to offer you free portals, or like I said earlier, they happen to be casting one for themselves anyway, then great. There is just a difference in water and portals, where one is expected and free, and the other is something the mage chooses to give to you or you pay for. Period.
---
He keeps bringing up reputation, but the only thing I am pulling from his comments is that he feels very entitled and dumps his expectations on other people. If he wants to play Mage that way and cast three portals for free at the end of every dungeon or quest, then more power to him, but expecting the same out of everyone else is pure entitlement and is not going to make Mages want to port him.
---
The irony of it, which is lost on him, is how much he keeps saying 18s is insignificant, which it is, but then refuses to pay it. If 18s isn't shit, then offer that to a Mage for a portal, or be respectful and appreciative and offer them the going rate of what is usually 1g. You can't say money doesn't matter and then refuse to give someone money. The guy reeks of someone you don't want to group or interact with, and it's amusing that he is saying that about me, but good luck to him. He's going to need it.
---
All humans look alike.
---
It’s not about the AOE.  It’s about when AOE is used.  Using AOE as a group strategy to clear is fine.  But using AOE as a mage action whenever 2 or more mobs are aggroed is not.
---
Looks like there could be something hidden in binary (upper/lower case)
---
I haven’t seen snow, granted I haven’t spent much time in Winterspring, but I have definitely seen varying degrees of rain and dust storms. These are 100% in Classic. I think they just don’t happen all too often, so if you don’t spend long enough in a zone you might not see it.
---
One of my favorites was a huge downpour in southern stranglethorn. Could barely see ~20 yards in front of your character. I agree that they add a sense of immersion, but don’t worry weather effects are definitely in game.
---
0/31/20 is the meta atm for dual wield tanking anyway
---
Leveling enchanting before 60 is pointless, it's a goldsink.
---
Don't drop skinning, you might get a lucky Devilsaur kill and you're suddenly +-12g richer. Get your leatherworking asap to 250 so you can start making cured rugged hide every 3 days, on my server it's going for 20g.
---
At 60 drop skinning for enchanting and you still got a passive income from LW. 
---
You can also make money while afk with leatherworking once you can make nightscape headbands. Buy thick leather cheaper than 1g40 a stack and vendor the crafts. Depending on how much you want your mount you can also keep your crafts for disenchanting them later.
---
Well that's right poopy
---
Spoopy
---
Haha..people are learning. I was in karazan with my warlock aggroing everything before I learned I could take my pet off aggressive..haha.
---
I personally don’t sweat leveling gear too much, but I’m a warlock, so it doesn’t really affect my dps ...just health, regen, and crit chance. And all those are minimal differences..definitely not worth blowing gold over for a few levels.
---
Gratz on 26! You’ll be there in no time. Enjoy it!
---
The problem is pug related. Most pugs fail at running efficiently. For a pug running a dungeon at a steady pace without trying to be fancy is probably most efficient. If things click, then you can try going faster and pulling more. A single mage trying to aoe does more harm than good. Three mages rotating their cooldowns is a different story
---
I gank all day some days. I love BRM. Standing near the ledge of the jump to brd pretending to be afk and frost nova people jumping so they lose their momentum and fall on the rock and die. And frost nova and slow the lava swimmers. Or slow them when they pull the elites on their way in. Anything to make them lose durability before the dungeon start.
---
Yesterday i got to kill a warrior 5 times like this. He hearthed to repair or got ported. Because i saw his group summon him back. Wiped the whole group except the warlock with a double shatter coldsnap combo. I bet they were furious. Loved it.
---
Yea as a healer I just deal. 15 years of playing and its always the same. Its not a retail problem. The majority just suck at playing these types of game. They run around like they're in first person POV and don't understand how things like cleaves work. 
---
I just cover for the stupid where I can make it through. More often than not you gotta realize you're probably playing with some 10 year old kid who is playing for the first time or some 35 year old who is distracted by a screaming kid every 2 seconds in between talking about how much nostalgic fun he is having.
---
Legit doesn't make it any more okay. If the person in the grocery store shouts "I'm gonna slip on this" then does so, they still win the lawsuit in 99 out of 100 cases, so...
---
First time player here. So just hit 40 as an enhance shaman an its really fun an can heal dungeons just fine. An i picked shaman because i wanted to be a healer support kind of guy so im excited to fill that roll even better when i respec into restoration. Anyway my question is when should i respec into resto? If i do it at say 50 will my time out questing be terrible? Can i heal in dungeons all the way up to 60 on enhance? Not really sure what to do.
---
You're kinda selfish.
---
I think in this context they can provide nothing for free or paid. They will have no reliable data to report on this. Pure conjecture and estimates based on flawed data.
---
That's not to say the company isn't useful. But they have no data to reliably back up a very specific claim about month to month WoW subscriber numbers, because just like the rest of us they havent been able to verify those numbers for years.
---
Tomtom
---
Tbh I don’t understand the journey part? From what I’ve seen the quests are pretty meh and the combat is basic enough where it doesn’t seem fun to level at all. Pvp and high level raid seems more fun, so it makes sense to rush through it
---
How is this a productive comment?
---
It's a trap...
---
&gt; empty bags
---
I don't understand
---
This is my attitude as a veteran mage.
---
They need to know that they are made of paper. It's important.
---
Sounds like you provoked the reaction you got.
---
Dude it sounds like your problem is pretending the userbase here are one collective mass who have conflicting opinions. It's actually just a bunch of people with a crazy variety of hot takes on every issue. Lay off this sub for a bit, you don't need this kind of drama I your life lol
---
Main 26 Warlock 
---
Alt 10 paladin
---
Bank alt
---
Oh you poor thing.  You'll see.   I played druid in vanilla ya know.   Hey, funfact!  Did you know that only one resto druid was ever brought to raids, and that was only for their cooldowns?   They are quite inferior to other classes and without innervate/brez they'd be totally ignored.
---
I forsee -  *rubs temples* -  I forsee a gigantic flood of druids, ret paladins, shadow priests, and every other non-viable spec in classic (which is most of the specs) desperately LFG with no luck.   I  forsee..   ah, its coming to me... I forsee you guys rerolling as priests, mages, warriors... yes...
---
Good thing  you only need a  wand to lvl  a priest.
---
They already did. You missed the bump
---
Thanks for blurring out that vulgar image with this horrible picture.
---
That's cool.  They've provoked the loss of a sub. /shrug
---
The most interesting part for me was people talking about the Bush/Gore election in the first screenshot
---
Doesn't make the slightest sense to me either.
---
Some of us play the game because we do indeed enjoy playing the game.
---
Thank you for rationality. The warrior tank in my group with ravager would EASILY pull 400+ dps on our pulls in both SM and ZF, often beating our mage. Go sword and shield and he both won't hold any threat on anything (thus making this armor worthless, because nothing is hitting him) and provide our group with a massive damage loss.
---
Eh it’s fair to be looking for other alts to play with at this point. Most of the serious players have already done the weekly mc/ony and have most of the craftable/5man bis items done.
---
We’re already at the point where people are rolling alts to stop themselves being bored.
---
Sorry, all I remember is that it was talked about because a big streamer who played classic on private servers ran it.
---
In my experience people generally did care for getting a different factions mount, it's part of endgame to farm for things.
---
Re: auctionator
---
Download the add on, dump the addon in my addons folder.
---
Log in, enable addon, enter game, no addon. 
---
Addon menu. Addon is yellow. Untick box. Needs reload. Reload UI, retick box, needs reload. Reload UI, still no addon in game.
---
Sigh.
---
*edit*
---
Just got an ingame message telling me my addons are slowing down the game. I’ve got questie and auctionator.
---
Le sigh.
---
I'm 26 with 35 gold. But I have a family. So sometimes I log onto wow for like 15mins and just snipe boes blues from AH. Don't even bother questing unless I got like an hour.
---
I realize it's an unpopular opinion but I like the RNG. Gear dropping IN the raid is just way more exciting. 
---
Almost not even counting Naxx since it was in the game for such a short period and so few people did it.
---
Threat Plates (Classic) (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/threat-plates-classic) is pretty awesome for that.
---
So just for the record, you’re surprised that telling somebody to fuck off can lead to punishment for abusive chat?
---
You can switch which version You wanna install in the bottow of your battlenet.
---
Love to know the full load of crap you spewed before you replied like that. Good to see you go.
---
He is still exploiting layers, even right now at this moment, doing Ony for the 4th time this week, using as excuse he leads 4 40 men raid teams in his guild. Blizz probably going to let it slip because the moment you play with a cam in front of you it's ok because then the blizzard pedo's can jerkoff on your underaged face. Pedozzard.

Pinata mount
---
Thank right click reporting for this, it’s all automated
---
Go down the rabbit hole of free to play games and whales.
---
The average consumer is buying less then 1 micro a month. But the whales are buying so much they inflate that number beyond reason. It is a business model based in addiction and abusing human nature.
---
Just learned that you can have a macro to target the tank's target, I'll have to look it up
---
I want something like this tbh
---
How'd you ever get a RFD run down to 30m?
---
Growl turns off automatically in dungeons, different pet ai. I bind pet attack and pet return in classic, have no need in retail
---
Hahahaha so basically you walked into it, and got trolled good and hard. Pretty sure these 'silences' are auto generated when enough people report you for the same action, no GM involved in the decision. Not sure a 2 day silence is worth rage quiting over. Who's the snowflake now?
---
Yup you’ll be fine.
---
MANY companies right now are hugely plagued by short-sighted strategies and directives and it leads to all kinds of problems, many of which are much bigger than a dying MMORPG.  I cba to find the source right now but I saw something recently about some conference of a bunch of top-end business leaders all getting together and discussing/agreeing that this quarterly profit short term shit is not sustainable and needs to stop.
---
I think it is safe to assume they've been starving them.
---
Fully specced arms lvl 21 warrior here absolutely no issues tanking DM with defensive stance and sword n shield
---
Thanks thats a lot of info
---
Pussy.
---
Then it might be just about any PvP build you can find online. 
---
Most builds were theory crafted on private servers by the top performers.
---
Ah, good old Un'Goro. Ended up getting dumped because of that place. She took, "Oh crap the rex sees me, I'll message you when I get to safety," as me ignoring her. Oh well, wouldn't have worked out anyways.
---
What server was this on?
---
Make an alt and wait for the next phase. Go explore  and fish. Do you have questie? That can help find quests.
---
Once again, told no one in particular to "fuck off", I made a joke in general that contained profanity.  But thanks for demonstrating your comprehension skills.
---
Lordaeron is my city.
---
No one can save them from themselves
---
Its called right click reporting it is there to cut down on support overhead. Automated system that disregards context the intended use is for if someone goes off on a tirade against someone spouting abusive shit. In reality it can be used to silence people to troll them if enough people do it. Nobody at blizzard even saw what you said it was all done by a bot.
---
Mounts are nice... discounts... certain pvp items i think.
---
Mounts by the ability to even learn to ride a certain kind of mount
---
Lol I honestly think a lot of these new mages just don't know what they're doing. I was in a UBRS last night and I was one of two mages. On most trash packs of 2-4 the other Mage would literally just be spamming blizzard and coc instead of focussing with frostbolt. It's like they have this idea in their head of being uber efficient aoe gods but they a) don't know how to do it properly and b) don't know the appropriate time to do it
---
Yep. TomTom.
---
You know how sometimes mobs will run away and end up somewhere unlootable? Every time that happens it keeps me up at night because I just KNOW that's the one mob that dropped Felstriker or something ugh.
---
it’s pretty obvious you lack a lot of perspective on this.
---
Its not
---
This is the sort of add on I need to use, otherwise I end up running in circles while talking in guild chat inside w/e city town I am in.
---
As somebody who's entirely skipped the fishing minigame on every return to wow, what is lucrative about fishing? I'm not doubting, just legitimately do not know
---
no gods no masters
---
Equinox
---
That's the common strategy. Do whatever you want up until 60 then respec. 
---
If you have some healing gear in your bank then you can heal up to 60.
---
Fishing buddy
---
I had that theme on Windows XP too lol the memberberries
---
50-60 was faster for me then 30-45. That might just be me idk
---
Its also not blizzards fault if people who don't like streamers or their fans stay on their server.
---
Oh, I have no doubt that you're correct.  But automation versus employee doesn't change the result, which is that I will not pay for this.
---
If there was no layering in classic we wouldn't have been able to play for so long.  Those lines for quests you saw would still be happening except in every zone.
---
Low effort post, been reposted about 150 thousand times. Stop crying.
---
So are you going to post your lorti ui config to get your unit frames looking like that?
---
you have no idea what you’re talking about. world first used layering for only the last 4 levels because method fanboys were taking groups to gank him.
---
and ur an asshole
---
Looks like bartender 4, shadow units frames, and bagnon. This setup looks just like mine lmao. OP are you me?
---
Nvm
---
You're just dumb then. I'm a Mage as well and a lot of cloth gear is itemised well for non clothies, get over it.
---
I have to say I'm only 46 but I've only encountered one mage that tried to go Yolo with aoe. I (the tank) just let him keep the agro, wasn't much I could do anyway and healer let him die.
---
 Then we explained about threat and he was like oh sorry I'll try doing what you said and everything was fine. 
---
only thing that gets on my nerves are the legions of dps warriors with the spinning axe  UT that'll go away once they outlevel them :)
---
There is a difference between asking/paying for a Mage portal and actually demanding one. Being in a dungeon with a Mage does not entitle you to a portal. I agree it entitles you to water, and as I said multiple times, I give that out happily. He keeps saying that money doesn't matter and then refuses to pay. I find that asinine and that is what we are arguing about, his hypocrisy. I saw in other comments he is trying to twist it around, but it's just not what I am saying.
---
I think maybe my responses are being misconstrued. I am not the polar opposite of him demanding payment for everything, I am saying he is ridiculous for equating an optional, generally money-making spell like portals to basic shit like a hunters arrows. If a hunter could shoot me with special arrows that teleport me to Orgrimmar, I'd pay him for them and never demand a free one. His arguments make no sense at all and he reeks of entitlement with every one of his posts.
---
At this point I've said what I can say. Either people understand me or they think we are both assholes at this point. I tried to explain it the best I can, but I don't know what else to say.
---
Tanking feels terrible right now. It's like the group just thinks you are a taunt bot who exists to save them at the last minute from dying. 
---
I'm going to start letting people die.
---
If you actively seek out those posts where people shit on classic in your own mind youre gonna have a bad time. Let it go and play the game. Its like any retard who can shit on BFA and get upvotes.
---
We are a month in already?! I just hit level 38
---
Yeeeah, but us mages are taught to never blink until you guys use intercept soooo
---
I liked where to people rolled 1 and it gets assigned randomly.
---
Wow the beginning of your story is so similar to mine. Star wars among other games -&gt; wow beta -&gt; wow vanilla and never looked back. Quit back in early wrath after raiding 7 nights a week split between my main guild (top 250 north American guild) 4 nights a week and a guild I joined on my alt enhancement shaman and carried thru SSC and Kael and into bt. I've been tempted to come back once or twice over the years but when 10+ ppl you played with back in the day are all excited about wow classic you out down your 1 yr old and pick up the keyboard once again. Sorry Nicole. 
---
I saved quiet a bit of screen shots back in the day, lost way too many to PC's dying or whatever. Only have a dozen or so saved on a photobucket account and they just kill me. Between the 500 mods leaving me a 1 square inch of visible landscape while raid tanking, or the spam whispers of grats after server firsts. Atleast we have some raid videos on Facebook I can look at. Even if it is some of the worst quality videos you can watch on there. Super pixelated. You can still hear me screaming.... 
---
P.s. This is my longest Reddit post or comment. Wow is one of the only things in my life I've ever "mastered", as in spent a rediculous amount of time doing and become highly skilled. I've always been very passionate about the game and will always remember. Thank you.
---
I seem to recall more questing options in the last 10 levels, but I could be wrong.
---
Eh. Sure. But so are those warriors. They don't want to lower tehmselves to being a tank. They dont want to bother learning what it is the tank has to do or any of that to progress. It just leaves more groups out without tanks when most folk end up going LF 1M &lt;dungeon&gt; Need tank for the next hour.
---
They have the option to do exactly what I am doing.  But none of them want to learn or do it because it sucks.
---

---
Yeah the trick is finding a place to grind. As a shadow priest I can pull mobs back to back without ever need to break , my xp per hour goes pretty high  buts lots pretty dman rare to find those spots.
---
Hell yeah, I finally unlocked Repentance! Nothing says "Retribution" like a six-second sap that only works on humanoids!
---
I mean I agree for the most part too, but youll see soon enough how tedious it becomes to keep running MC week after week for your tier 2 legs that never drop when theyre pretty much the only thing needed aside from the lucky legendary drops.  Gets pretty tiresome.
---
Yeah definitely. You don't have to jump zones so much to do quest
---
I've caught TotalBiscuit cranking settings up that actively degraded visuals more than once because this was his attitude.
---
RIP the only game reviewer willing to humiliate himself in an options menu.
---
The way I've heard it is that once you get to level 47, you're halfway there.
---
This is why I come to the comments
---
What server are you on? I'm a 47 Hunter and all I do is dungeons.  I ran Zul'Farrak around 10 times last night, each with a different group I found in LFG.
---
Why hello, I wanted to ask you something. Are you aware that... there is a devilsaur coming at us right now? Ok bye
---
this is not my experience at all but I was in the first wave to 60 so maybe that's what I'm seeing a difference there. Haven't seen any mages who can't do spellcleave correctly
---
Which is WAY more important than anyone's opinion about how their nameplates aren't useful.
---
Dude killed me on an ironman private server lvl 59 of 60...  forever rageboner.
---
To be honest I wouldn't say anything or start anything, I'd just suddenly have an emergency and drop.
---
This also breaks game balance.
---
Just heard this while enchanting qnd tailoring in ironforge, googled and this was the first result. Glad im not alone in thinking so
---
Glad we agree.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Not everyone runs the add on and is a try hard.
---
As someone who played druid in vanilla... maybe you were just playing wrong.
---
I never had mana issues in five mans or in raids, even when things got a little out of hand. The only thing that I thought was shitty was not having a 'normal' rez.
---
Tanking sucked at lower levels, but it was doable if you had a decent group. I always ran with guildies so it wasn't a problem.
---
Oh yeh then how did private servers do it? More servers and dynamic respawns are better than this. Low effort trying to fix the problem u just want to accot something that ruins the game and is not in the spirit of vanilla fuck you layering bfa fan boi. Classic is not vanilla its a blizz mutant!
---
I’ve heard that too, but don’t think it’s correct.
---
Private servers didn't have a million players.
---
Couldn’t agree more. I’m a bear tank (lvl40) and every SM group tries to pull the entire dungeons and makes it a fucking mess. Even when I make a group and don’t even mention “cleave”, every mage/lock thinks it’s retail and they read that its the flavor of the day meta to the pull everything. It annoying as hell.
---
Yes and the journey to Westfall through STV is fun with a group of horde players around level 19/20.
---
Not a retail player. I just think it’s fun to do AoE. Fun to running it a different way than I’ve done 1000 times. Why do I have to justify playing the way I think is the most entertaining?
---
While not every Baron mount is layering abuse. I think that was one of the big bosses that was abused by the people doing it.
---
Horseshit, you're lying. For starters there are lots of non aoe classes likewise looking for groups. Second not every dungeon is even good for that shit. People aren't spell leaving fucking Sunken Temple. Maraudon has a bunch of BiS shit for several common classes so it's often ran without the aoe setups.
---
Is there any alternative to the +dmg ZF staff for warlocks? I’m about to hit 50 and getting tired of that dungeon .... 
---
I’m hoping there’s a decent quest staff or boss drop in the next dungeon? I’m still running around with hypnotic blade from SM
---
I also played druid in vanilla. All three viable specs, too. (Though we didn't know about Crowd Pummeler back then so cat wasn't nearly as good as it can be now).
---
how can i get mine to look like this
---
Look at Mr. Hollywood with his soy sauce
---
Big difference here is the $15/mo subscription, tripling the sub count is triple that $15 that is almost guaranteed at the end of the month. Imagine going from a $15/hr job to a $45/hr job.
---
Get WW Axe.
---
You don't understand economics enough to be making that statement.  Be sure to bring up how pservers did everything right with their devilsaur mafias and such.  I'm sure that promoted a strong economy.
---
hehe retail players so noob xD!!
---
If you arent spending time spamming dungeons at 60 or raiding and thats your endgame content it isnt that crazy.
---
How do you know?
---
....oh, geez
---
You can, I did it
---
I was soloing them on my rogue at 55 while leveling there. I used a hp pot, bandage, and every cd. If blind missed I either died or got the vanish of in time. I was successful 90+% of the time and was able to craft both pieces at 55. I just camped the nw spawn and got a piece of leather every 15 minutes give or take.
---
Salame
---
How is it BOP yet made by someone?
---
Your on a classic wow sub supporting layering you are trash.
---
We in &lt;BLaDE of KiLL&gt; (same server as OP) had a double binding run 8 days ago in one of our MC runs (we have 2) which is undoubtedly first of Classic.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/482188070?t=02h04m49s
---
Look at my horse; my horse is amazing.
---
Don't worry, they'll learn their place when they enter ST and BRD at low levels and get rekt. I found that they chill out a bit at this point. Its just SM and ZF thats a problem at the moment.
---
Look up their spawn points and patrol paths so you can make the most of it.
---
They expected to fill 4 servers in europe. They filled 6 times that many servers. China has 65 servers. Population numbers are rock steady. 
---
No, they didn't ruin the launch. People wouldn't be quitting in droves if it was ruined. Stop being hysterical.
---
Grats! That recipe drop is brutal. Great piece of gear to carry you for a while!
---
Because I'm the someone.
---
You mean the 20g repairs?
---
They’re the one who made it.
---
OP is the user who crafted. You can see slightly through the window that it’s the same name who crafted :)
---
The above points you listed would not be a reason that you should even run out of mana.
---
Your level is relevant because healing RFC at 13 is different from SM groups at 40 is different from ubrs at 60.
---
How did you get your camera to be so far back? Or does it just seem that way because you're a gnome..
---
It is the “world” of warcraft not the world of many worlds within warcraft. Layering is fucked remove it all together
---
Druid tanks worked fine on private servers.  The problem usually isnt dps not being geared enough but how threat capped the tank is.  If you are gonna have a 3 minute fight you can tell 3 healers to just hard focus the tank the entire time and they will live no matter what.  All you need at that point is enough threat per second that your dps are able to pop consumables and actually give a shit.   If half your raid gives a shit you probably arent in that territory, but if you find a group of people that care about their numbers and want to pop consumables/go engineering and actually min max druid tanks are better than prot warriors and only worse than duel wield fury tanks.
---
I feel this
---
The blowjobs would be amazing though
---
Lol it’s no where close to the best game I history, but it was certainly fun for awhile then stagnated. Try a new game, it’s good for your health.
---
Id probably recommend using the arrow keys and numpqd if youre playing as a leftie
---
Honestly they are both their own flavor of shit right now.  I've seen as many huntards leaving taunt on their pet or multi shotting to their hearts delight as I see mages waiting 3 seconds or 1 swipe and blizzarding away.
---
Preach Brother
---
Yea I’ve downloaded atlas, atlas maps, atlas loot and I still can’t get the dungeon maps working =\
---
As a Rogue, when you want to “unlearn my talents” does it return the money that you paid? Why would you want to unlearn a talent? I assume there a talent limit?
---
Are there any drawbacks to purchasing talents, trying them out, and then unlearning? Apart from  the cost?
---
I know a lot of people say “save your money to buy a mount,” but is spending a few silver really that bad? Or those people saying to save “money” or higher cost things and gold specifically?
---
This is my first wow experience so this is all new to me. I don’t want to waste time, money, and effort purchasing talents and items that I don’t need.
---
The trifecta
---
I am finding that even though the levels are slower to gain, I’m going about the same pace as I was from 1-48/49. Midway through the 50s at about 1.25/1.5 levels a night compared to the 2/3 lvls per night in the beginning.
---
Don’t know hotkey on Mac for screenshot, sorry about that. But this has been an issue since launch and tickets do not load on my account to report it.
---
Here is my most recent setup for WoW classic on my phone by using Steam Link.  I go through every button I have on screen starting from the right side, continuing counterclockwise around the UI.
---
This UI is tailored for my Priest, but can easily work for any other class with a few minutes of changing some options. I've added every basic ability that I use almost every time I play, including a button for swapping Main Actionbars, changing in and out of Shadow Form, and Fear ability. As well as a button for Map, a scroll wheel to zoom in and out on character, an auto-run button above the D-Pad, and buttons for Quest Log, Backpack, Water Drinking, and Mount. For the main action bar, I've made hotkeys 1-8 usable (which can double with the use of the Main Actionbar swap button), as well as having a spacebar for Jump, Tab for quick targeting and Escape key.  The main control of your camera is controlled via the circular pad that also has a right-button click bound with every touch (discovered that a touch from both of your thumbs on screen simultaneously will work as a right click, which in my opinion works better sometimes).  Additionally, there is a quick key for opening your keyboard, the main Steam Link interface, and a button to enable adjusting your on-screen buttons.  As shown, you may also control your cursor around the entire interface. I just prefer to keep the cursor centered on my character for ease of looting.
---
I apologize for the poor quality of the audio. Android no longer allows internal audio recording so this is the microphone recording the audio coming out.
---
can anyone that plays a tauren hunter confirm if the +2 range passive affects the minimum range needed to shoot an arrow?
---
Look at Osborne’s nameplate.
---
You downrank when you are 60 and have sp/hp, not when you are leveling.
---
I think I now realize why all these healers keep complaining about mana issues, they are downranking to heals that are way less mana efficient.
---
I use an add-on called spy. It is useful for detecting enemy faction players nearby, but it also has a kill on sight list. If ever a player on this list exists near you it plays a specific sound and lists their name.
---
and yet you did it anyways. anything for a few silver, huh.
---
I’m a bear tank and I’ve started to just not invite mages. I’m in no rush to 60 most of those epeen assholes can kick rocks.
---
Rainbow and Alliance. Myth confirmed.
---
In terms of actual numbers, it is correct. Just depends on how much the player pushes to gain that xp.
---
I live for the half second that you stay in seal form when you get on land. Not walking, not flopping, just gliding with the tip of your tail on the ground and your leathery skin in the breeze.
---
Just so you are aware the pet growl isn't a taunt (similar to sunder). It's a high threat ability yes, but not a forced Taunt. Very big misconception that I see. And it's not noticable unless the hunter is a higher level than the tank you can actually leave it on most of the time and never surpass the tanks threat. That leaves the pet typically at the number two tank spot incase the tank dies it can pick up the pack immediately. I personally have it hotkeyed and manually manage it but most won't want to do that.
---
It wasn't so much a "conversation" as it was Blizzard giving a warning. Notice, will you, how he immediately went straight to the point?
---
careful, you might cut yourself on all that edge
---
Sounds good. My plan now is to level as holy/disc hybrid until shadowform then back to holy/disc when raiding.
---
Retail is how it is because casuals want everything simplified as fuck and easy. Use addons if u need them. Games shouldnt be made go cater to casuals.
---
Well are you leveling or at lvl 60 trying to raid?
---
EoK is completely controlled by the player. That guy was just an idiot. There is no "going  crazy" unless he was lagging like a mofo with autorun on or something.
---
Someone posted macros an hour or so ago that toggle them on and off.  If you searchbox you can find them.
---
Not everyone using an addon is a try hard.
---
If people are being rude, of course don't help them.
---
But have you considered people might specifically seek out mages to group with because of your ability to portal? DPS is so easy to replace, so I think it's worth your while to offer free portals because that's the kind of think that gets you invited back for another run.
---
Even if its not about the money, it's still in your best interest to offer free portals. People seek after mages because mages offer awesome quality of life abilities. 
---
Not really trying to convince you of anything. Just consider people might expect a portal because that's the main reason you got invited in the first place over another DPS class..
---
not to mention solo AOE farming has been a thing for mages in classic on p servers since forever. 
---
a lot of this sub is angry because people don’t want to play the game like they did when they were 8 years old, but for me, and i’m sure a lot of other competent mages it’s like i’ve leveled enough on these routes from vanilla to wotlk that i’d rather just be efficient with my time so i can spend time making money at max for later phases when all the reddit drones quit because “it’s not the classic feel that i remember” because not everybody sucks dick anymore.
---
How the fuck do you know what i know layer lover? Why dont you go exploit some layers. P servers had a more stable economy yes this is an inferno you have no idea what your saying.
---
I expect most people heal while in dps spec levelling up. I've even met some feral druids who just switch out to Intel gear and heal dungeons which I found surprising but they nailed the heals. I wouldn't over think the levelling dungeons.
---
Some jerks will always jerk
---
What a lame post
---
You mean you don’t want discussions of feminazis and how Christ don’t real to spice up your leveling?
---
Mages doing their best to be the most hated class in Classic. Thanks for taking the heat off of rogues.
---
I am almost 60 and have NEVER had an issue with layering at all what so ever. Idkwtf people like you are talking about. You’re prolly one of those nostalrius kiddies that hopped on board near the end of its life because you found something on some random website talking about it. Go play the fucking game you twat..
---
I thought I noticed something similar with totems, but I think that guy was just bad and never actually dropped any useful ones.
---
I'm the same way. I also started in Cata, and I absolutely loved it. I'm also loving Classic, partly because I never got to experience the game the first time around. My only complaints are the nameplate distance and the fact that I need an add-on to see how much quest rewards are worth.
---
A lot of denial in this thread man. Sorry.
---
For me, retail is just a track you keep running around. Occasionally the scenery changes, but ultimately it's still just the same. 
---
Classic is a trail. A lot of the scenery along the way is the same, but ultimately theres an end to it.
---
Also, retail is punishing if you don't want to sell your soul to the game. At my height in Legion I could do daily's and weeklys for 2 raid-ready characters, and still have time to level a 3rd. In BFA I would get on Tuesday and just immediately know I wasnt getting all my stuff done for that week. First I gave up on islands, then I gave up on weekly quests, then I gave up on raiding, then I gave up on WoW. 
---
I also feel like Retail rewards you for playing and for quitting. The last 2 expansions I stopped playing about halfway through. When I came back there were things I wanted locked behind these crazy rep grinds: Allied races in Legion (Horde got screwed! Alliance reps were all original legion factions, horde were the new factions. Complete bullshit!) And flying in BFA. So my options were to grind my ass off to get the things I wanted, which i would have to keep playing to enjoy... or just quit again because if i wasnt playing the game i wouldnt miss Allied Races or Flying. So that's what I did. 
---
Now i log into Classic for an hour or two here and there, and then go do other things. Not feeling bad about missing a weekly or a world boss or a rep quest. They'll all still be there when I get to them.
---
I like the way you think. Purps please.
---
why didnt you fight back??
---
BOOM!!! HEADSHOT!!!
---
Yeh but that is there problem. Everyone knew they needed more servers. They could have done it better if they just released 1.12 stand alone from battle net.. go abuse layering you sellout
---
I thought maybe I just wasn’t getting the icons, but I’ve put my own Devo aura on many times when other pallys had it on and my armor goes up.
---
It really is that simple. Welcome to Vanilla!
---

---
You get a talent each level starting at level 10. Because the level cap is 60 there's a limited amount of talent points. 
---
To unlearn your talents costs 1 gold to start but it increases each time you do so; going up to 5g, then 10g, and increasing up to a cap of 50 gold. 
---
Your talents don't really matter until level 60 so that's why people just recommend not respeccing until then.
---
I thought the rep for pvp items was only from the bg factions but I could be wrong, it’s been a long time.
---
So nothing unless you don’t like your faction mounts.
---
Probs cuz u are a newb and cant see how vanilla economys play out. This is all sorts of weird.
---
That mentality is what drove me away from retail dungeons. People are so critical of everything and think they should be able to steam roll every dungeon and get so pissy if even one mistake happens. Wow retail has become a pretty toxic community
---
&gt; how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think I need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about the economy who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here
---
Fixed that for you.  Mark Hunt types better than you do.  You should feel bad.
---
No question it's a great item. I'd try to get it a little lower.  But if you have the skill no question you will make your money back.
---
They were advertized on faelina for 50g constantly, but then again that's a high pop server
---
Joy Division - The Wombats :)
---
Only problem is you have trouble with the text
---
He died doing what he loved most, living.
---
I understand the itemization, the thing is... that gear is better utilized by a mage(or lock) than it is a shaman, and shamans(for example) being able to utilize higher quality armor is useful in both PVP and soloing. That's why it's annoying to me.
---
It's worth it if you think 180 gold is worth it
---
How does this happen?
---
I’ve had zero issues
---
Where is the shaman sitting out of combat rezzing people? That's one of my first memories of MC boss fights. Assume that's been patched with the build that went live?
---
K
---
At 60 you should be able to go down both trees to get all essential talents from each. 
---
And pick between beastial wrath or scatter shot, only huge difference. 
---
Dont go full MM or MM/survival, it's bad for pvp unless you stack a lot of stamina
---
I think you are mixing up talents and abilities. Abilities you go to a class trainer and pay for, these can't be unlearned and you keep permanently.
---
Talents start at level 10, and are essentially specialisation points. You get one point per level to put into different specialisations (e.g. Frost vs Fire vs Arcane specialisation for mages). These points can  only be changed by paying a fee to get all your points back. 
---
You do not get your money back for relearning all your talents, and each time you respec your talents it costs more and more money.
---
The conventional wisdom (which I agree with) is that its extremely rarely worth respeccing your talents prior to level 60, as long as youve put your points into the levelling tree of your class. It's a waste of money.
---
You cant casually play an offspec, offspecs are for players with more experience and who want challenge and are willing to put in the extra effort.
---
But its the same drop rate, either way you are killing 40 boars on average. How is that ez mode.
---
Yeh and your probs coming from bfa. Want layering an item shop and some transmog. Fuckin g hell has everyone gone mad? Layering is fucking. Dumb who wants a chance for multiple worlds it affects pvp, main city pops, loot!! Fucking idiots im done with you sellouts
---
Awesome list, thankyou. I’ll download all these next time I’m on!
---
It's actually the opposite from what you described. Multi shot is one of your only important DPS spells. Serpent sting is great when you have plenty of mana to spare for a single pull. But for long stretches of grinding it's better to not serpent sting so that you can save mana for Multi Shot and Mend Pet. I never use Arcane Shot unless it's an all out boss pull or something where mana isn't a concern. Once you get Aimed Shot you will almost never use Arcane Shot again for PVE.
---
It's 1 in 10,000.
---
I am leveling my priest as Discipline with a few points in shadow. Currently I am 47 but I have healed since retail vanilla and mained a priest for BC. 
---
The most important leveling talents fot a priest before 40 will be spirit tap and wand specilization. This allows for maximum uptime during quests as you only need to cast a few spells before wanding the last half of the mobs health down. In addition to spirit tap I also go for improved Shadow Word Pain as not reapplying really helps longevity between drinks.
---
From there i went deep into disc, actually just picked up power infusion since I spent those 7 points in shadow. I prefer Disc while leveling to Holy as I am on a pvp server and the utility of Disc has paid dividends. Having Diving Spirit and Inner Fire have certainly helped my uptime and saved dungeons. 
---
Now you can heal dungeons as shadow until 45-50 but at a noticable disadvantage to the other specs. Shadow isnt worth fully specing into until 40 as you will get shadow form and Rank 3 Mind Flay. Even then you would grab Wand Spec for the next 5 levels.
---
If you are truly intent on strictly instance grinding and no one can talk you out of the mindless grind that is 30-50 then any Classic Priest Holy Spec you find in the top results on google will serve you fine. Lightwell is a waste of a talent ninety nine times out of one hundred. 
---
Good luck.
---
probably one of the instance layering exploit abusers
---
Is your PvP flagged?
---
Hint: look at Osborne’s nameplate...
---
Shadow spec so you can level solo in off time with out dungeons.      
---
    
---
Seriously.. the talents you get that buff certain spells/abilities ARE LITERALLY USELESS until you get the gear to make it worth while. Like imp bible and imp stam gives like an extra 80-120 damage absorbed from shield, which is less than HALF of the damage mobs do in the 40+ range in instances, along with an extra 8 stam.. or 80 hp.. which is less than 1/4 of the damage a mob does in 40+ dungeons. The o oh thing “worth” it is the spirit tap and imp wand. Anything else is up in the air until you get to end game. Anyone who says otherwise is a ducking scrub that doesn’t know how math works in this game. It literally doesn’t matter what spec you play from 1-58. FFS you could not put any talents in at all and STILL heal/dps just fine. Don’t let any one tell you otherwise. Just put points where you think they will help the group/your play style. Then at 60, go the cookie cutter spec and play end game.
---
Nothing in this game is useful to anything.  It's grind all the way down. (/s)
---
That being said, the two biggies are off race mounts and crafting recipes.
---
For 99% of the classic playerbase, having an off race mount is the most e-relevance they'll achieve besides establishing gaming friends.
---
It is now but isn’t always, is that a known bug with this?
---
When you serpent sting all the targets you should be doing 1 auto attack in between them not sure of you are doing this already. 
---
Multi shot is also good for single target, it will hit harder than your arcane shot for not much more mana and will crit high if you get lucky.
---
I only buy discount portals from mages.
---
Hah, I just finished making one myself to do exactly that. Can't believe I spent this long thinking that herbs were so invisible.
---
Never thought about that, awesomeness. Really helpful addon
---

Why would the bot follow you though

If you both roll need then probably not, but not an expert.
---
Dude ur freezing band is the real accomplishment here
---
You should feel bad, standard reddit nerd commenting on spelling and grammar as an insult.  Im on here trying to bring attention to a game breaking issue and yall are here worshipping blizzard. Fucking idiots.
---
Back in vanilla you could kite mobs all across the continent you are on, you just have to damage it every so often and you can run with it to wherever, this includes bringing  high level elites to cities, it’s actually great
---
Pretty sure I'm paying to play WoW Classic.
---
You can pay my sub if you want and I'll play how you like.
---
Still missing the 'of' so like every time this gets posted.. boo
---
Of course inflation applies to user generated stuff. But my argument still stands.
---
It's not a bug, it's intentional. 
---
You either both need to be flagged or both need to be not flagged. 
---
It's to stop a group of paladins from being unflagged and buffing the crap out of their flagged warrior.
---
If you use TSM, you can buy any number too. You're not limited to the max stack of the item.
---
Ugh, whatever.
---
You have no idea wtf you’re talking about kid. Go get mad at something else in your life rather than a feature that was implemented for the 6,000,000 players trying to join the game. Lmfao calling me a Bfa scrub. Dude you literally don’t know wtf your talking about. Go away. Keep your shit tier opinions to yourself and play the game like the rest of us.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
when you mind control someone, can you casts their spells? always thought it was just auto attack that's possible
---
I will say this is less of issue for me when it comes to water/food since it's just mana and time really. It's the portal comments that kinda get me a little disgruntled. Very much agree.
---
Thirty-ish is when it starts to exist because that's when the quest drought starts and all the classes get their AoE fully fleshed out.
---
The 40is is when it gets absolutely obscene because of the questing chokepoints, the PvP density, and the simple fact that that's where the huge pack of the terrible AoE farmers are currently at
---
Bryan I got a message in my alphabets!
---
I get the same issue sometimes and have sent several tickets, idk if it depends on what instance your running or what
---
For everyone
---
I turned PVP on last night for a big fight, I grinded deadmines for manY levels without PvP on.
---
I'm sorry you're such an economy nerd that you can't have fun in Classic and need to show up here to shit on everyone who doesn't give a single fuck about the economy of the server they're having loads of fun on.
---
tl;dr - no one cares
---
Daily straight forward and widely used configuration. Mine doesn’t look too different.
---
man I feel your pain but looking at all of your healing abilities ready and your decision to not use it, was more painful to me
---
We gotta chill with these posts. It’s getting obnoxious.
---
Thank god it wasn't Asmon or Macockhold that got it.
---
&gt; Idk man I'm high as hell.
---
I can finally mark that off my Classic WoW Bingo card.
---
Mine is similar. I have a chat box in the bottom right as well which is tuned to either LFG or party chat. I also have grid setup and always on for healing.

I was going to if the second one didnt show up didn't want to give them the satisfaction of resisting

Nope, it's just a reference to Ultima Online. UO was the first game to coin the term "MMORPG", while you were dead you were a ghost. But it wasn't like wow, you were not meant to find your way back to your corpse. You became a ghost at your corpse, and had to find a spirit healer, shrine, or another player to resurrect you.
---
Most importantly, if you tried talking while you were a ghost, other players only saw "ooOoOoOo", unless that player had taken the time to level up "Spirit Speak". If a player had Spirit Speak, they could understand you. 
---
Unfortunately no one leveled spirit speak as it was mostly worthless. Players found other ways to chat, like in guild, or voice chat programs. So all anyone ever saw was oOoOooo in game when you were a ghost.
---
Start offering free food and drink for more mage rage :)
---
Its on 700g on my server so I can imagine
---
You both have to be the same. Either both flagged or both unflagged. 
---
In the picture provided the other paladin isn't flagged but you didn't show yourself.
---
I make friends fine and my attitude is perfectly acceptable. I help because I want to help not because someone is entitled to my help in a video game. Just don't be disrespectful. Been smooth sailing.
---
Cast lower levels at certain times to do quick heals or not blow as much Mana on a heal that might over heal, your best bet is a YouTube video of something since each class does it different
---
What about classic? Is it good for questing to 60 (solo most likely)?
---
Are you sure your being super cereal?
---
I did it in Vanilla for my tier 1 and tier 2, yeah it was frustrating but in the end it was more fulfilling than just redeeming some guaranteed tokens.
---
Having mages nova &gt; coc 0.5seconds after i charge in really grinds my gears, even when you try to tell them that single target is better and does more damage unless its a bigger pack they refuse to listen. and every time i have to sit there and watch as my rage drains to 0 cuz the healer and X mages is oom and needs to drink
---
You so mad! It’s hilarious that something like layering is making you so mad and not enjoy the game! Go back to bfa is your best insult! Sure I’ll go back and reflect mythic the palace for the fourth time.
---
Hahaha dude. You went wrong as soon as you assumed playing a mage in classic would be anything like it is in retail.
---
Fire Mage = spam fireball
---
Frost mage = spam frost bolt
---
Both make use of frost nova to kite and fire blast etc 
---
Frost is just better in general because you can aoe level with blizzard, but I guarantee its won't happen in the way you think it does from retail. Look up some guides on it on YouTube.
---
Im having fun, its just people are/have been duplicating boss loot and ruinging the econmy, we all said this would happen, the players who know the game and it has. You scrubs have your fun, it is better then bfa but this is not vanilla is is a mutant.
---
&gt;Pack size was somewhere between 6 and 14 mobs, depending on patrol positions.
---
As soon as every mob was in his range, I started to Blizzard. He barely lost aggro.
---
Lol.
---
&gt;That's after the demo shout patch.
---
LOL. This guy thinks demoralizing shout can out aggro blizzard. My god. 
---
Demoralizing Shout deals 43 threat. To pull agro, you need to generate 125% more threat than the current person who has agro. 
---
Mages deal .8 threat / damage.
---
So.... uh, maybe 80 damage would pull off a Demoralizing Shout.
---
Sooo.............
---
It's because of PvP flags. 
---
You all have to be in the same state. Either all flagged or all unflagged to benefit from auras like paladin and shaman.

---
Yeah, mage gave water to the healer for free, demanded 50s from other Mana using dps in the group.
---
I just life tapped the whole time and indirectly used the free mage water for the healer by using his mana 🙃
---
I am flagged in this photo, I haven’t been before, but maybe they always have been, ill test it out, thanks a ton
---
Gathermate Lite does this with node spawns if you’re interested in that. Just share your configs in discord with guildies.
---
You can google the hard numbers, they arent that hard to find.
---
Downranking isnt worth while till higher levels and a good amount of +Healing Power. 
---
Even then it will depend on you, a knowledgeable healer, to know which downrank will get the target as close to 100% with out going over.
---
The real reason for downranking is to minimize overhealing which in turn saves on mana.
---
Control+P will allow you to not have the screen duplicated but second monitor only so you won’t be seeing double
---
Tokens for tier sets, AKA a token would drop that would give a tier piece to something like Priests, Warriors, and Waelocks.

---
When you're playing WoW every waking hour of the day, it stops being a hobby and becomes an addiction.
---
I wnjoy the game, it still shits on your precious bfa. But it could have been even better by simply not including layering. I know its too much for you why dont you go collect a mount. Honestly go back to bfa you are an idiot
---
If I’m flagged and he is not, does he still get mine?
---
I can't stand it when other players tell you how to play your class. Even as a dps, people are always saying "just sprint" or "just vanish lmao". Well, gee, here I was gonna' go take out my fishing rod and start fishing during the middle of a wipe but now that you mention it I think I *will* vanish! 
---
Like... I know what my abilities are. They can be on cooldowns and I'm the one that knows that. It really grinds my gears.
---
Druidbar
---
There are tons of people with all sorts of advice who are full of shit because they're wrong about the versions of the current build.
---
Totems will get you killed if what you want to do relies on them in open terrain BUT in closed-in situations like BG buildings they're great sentries and assistance.   (like towers in AV)
---
Yeah those. Not a fan.
---
Aye.. I have a timer set to 8 seconds before I dps, once timer is up I throw corruption and press shadow bolt, after about 2-3 bolts I tend to get aggro. Idk if it's me, or the tanks, gear isn't even too good (level 60).
---
my server doesnt have any streamers but still has hour long queues.
---
but have you actually made a character on any of the destination servers? they are dead as fuck.
---
What does your macro look like? I always manually pick pocket all my mobs
---
&gt;There's basically only two **general purpose CC spells**
---
But its not.. its like 15% mages - and there are more slots than for rogues :)
---
Yes!!!!!!!!!!
---
Is it even worth getting the 3 extra frost spell damage over the 18 all spell damage? What about on a pve server for hundreds of gold?
---
Update: lvl 60 feral druid, 5k health, 6.5k armor, 19% crit, 14.5% dodge. Killed 22 in around 2 hours while watching tv. Had to pot 3 times and frenzied regeneration in less than 1 third of the fights. Pretty easy once you kill a couple and get used to the fight. EZ money
---
&gt; I don't understand this argument. Back in vanilla I saw tanks try to tank with a 2H and it just didn't work, they got eaten alive.
---
It does in classic, Assuming you have a healer that knows what they're doing. and a group. For deadmines for example a healer that knows what they're doing can take a level 16 tank rocking a 2hander all the way up to vancleef. Killing him however, is another story.
---
There is literally no reason to be using a macro to wand. If you’re coming from private servers, wand macroing was using the hunters auto shot code which allows for breaks to allow other castable spells. Wand is a channel spell, unlike hunters auto shot which is an auto ranged attack just like regular auto attack.    
---
What are you trying to do with the macro? It looks like you’re just trying to make it so you have a shift modifier to start the channel??!? When in reality you can just complete get rid of the macro and still use a shift modifier keybind..    
---
Is that what you’re trying to do??
---
Ecin
---
!remindme 12 hours
---
I feel so small as a holy Paladin...
---
Oh, they were lol. That run took a long time, and the healer never had to do anything unless we were on a boss. I asked if we could pull a few more at the time but no response. Oh well!
---
I’ve been playing pure elemental shaman so far and been having a blast. I’ll probably spec into restoration as my secondary talent tree though as there’s some pretty good talents over there and being a caster/melee hybrid is pretty difficult. Lvl 32 currently and man chain lightning is so satisfying. You don’t do as much dps as a mage but you supply a lot of utility to the group in the form of your totems while still dishing out some solid dps numbers. This is all based on my experience thus far and I can’t really attest for later on in the game but I’m having a blast with it right now!
---
One of the big downsides is the fact that unlike a mage you can’t make your own water, so unless you have a mage in your group you’re going to have to either ask around to see if any mages will trade you water; buy it, or go grind it out at some mobs. I personally don’t have a mage in my group and found that killing that water elementals is a quick way of stocking up on a lot of bubbling water while at the same time getting you some xp. 
---
Unless if you’re really planning on going super hardcore, just play what you wanna play and have fun with it man :)
---
It's also because people are impatient as Hell, especially since so many computer games are fast-paced.
---
You will never have enough training points to learn everything. They're like talent points, you have to choose where to spend them.
---
Congrats mate
---
It doesn't really matter. 
---
Player-skill matters vastly more than any little talent adjustments. Focus on spell-choice, timing, target-choice, mana-conservation, etc. Making one small mistake in timing or mana during a pull will make a much larger difference than a little difference in talent order.
---
The difference that talent order makes is functionally invisible next to the differences that crop up during a fight, especially if you're still learning the class.
---
Just focus on getting a little bit cleaner &amp; more confident in your healing every dungeon, and pick talents in the order that makes sense to you. This has the added benefit of your needing to actually read &amp; think about the talents, which will help you have them more engrained, rather than just thoughtlessly copy-pasting someone else's track.

The one SC group I ended up in as a healer I left before leaving IF. I said I was a healer looking for a run. Got invited to a group that was 4 mages. Said I liked "normal runs", they said "It's fine, we don't need a tank for AoE farming we don't get hit".  
---
Obvious response "Then you don't need a healer" and left.
---
[He finally out levelled Kakarot.](https://i.imgur.com/1S13WyJ.jpg)
---
Because I'm a Mage and don't want any spirit, so I don't pick gear pieces that have it.
---
I don’t get it. What’s so special about chrome?
---
Only 11, I'm just a guy that likes to have a plan early
---
Pets are amazing for pvp though. You can stay out of range of most classes with aspect of the cheetah and let your pet wreck them. If they decide to try and kill your pet you can turn around and lay into them yourself.
---
You just reminded me of doing alt runs in Kara back in bc. I tanked on my main (warr) but played my rogue on alt runs. Inversely, one of the raid leaders/main top dps played a bear tank as his alt. I made a cheap shot macro that /yelled STUNLAWKBEEOTCH!!!!!11!!one night after a complaint about stunning a mob thus preventing his rage generation. It was very cathartic, lol. I was only allowed to use it a couple of times that night but it became a part of my rogues legendary arsenal from then on. Sorry, just reminded me of good times back in the day.
---
na i bought 48 calls  before release
---
Oh lmao thought you were a priest.
---
&gt;No wonder they cant handle classic.
---
Can't handle classic lol, you could handle classic half asleep. God forbid someone doesn't want to slog through at least a week /played of mind numbingly boring and dated questing/mob grinding that they've done 10 times already
---
That mouse over is pretty nifty though
---
I’d say the odds are one in however many license plates there are
---
And this can still be done? That's pretty cool
---
How much is the lvl 40 mount? Currently at 34 gold at lvl 37
---
No. In my opinion it’s faster
---
Had this happen to me. Felt great until I loaded into the barrens and it made me fall off into fatigue water.... Wasn't my favorite corpse run so far honestly
---
Yeah, I’m pretty sure they fixed that. Everyone enters combat on pull now.
---
A guy calling himself [Shamus the Insulter](https://youtu.be/VssO3nXEAzQ) walks around the Minnesota Renaissance Festival and insults people for tips. Its pretty great.
---
Yeah. It's not gunna be fun to be a mage
---
For future reference VIA the blizzard support area you can actually just Unstuck automatically from the website.
---
I might say it failed but it works. (This works on classic.)
---
“The beauty of vanilla is playing the way you want”
---
And then there’s beta min maxing meta obsessed nerds like this
---
How long they suspended you for?
---
Ive tried to get back into retail a few times over the years since WoTLK and everytime I'm left feeling empty. Classic is all I am interested in. LONG LIVE CLASSIC
---
Wtf? Yes it does! LMAO dude... just because your screen is reading 25ms doesn’t mean you’re getting that. Everything is hardcoded for a 400ms delay.. giving melee the “leeway” that was described.. what don’t you get? Mobs have a delay.. so when you run away, you’re still in range of said mob until you slow it.. what are you not understanding about that? I don’t get what you’re trying to argue after I just explained literally how it works..
---
If Classic had come out during legion I probably wouldn't have spent more than a day playing it
---
The thing is you shouldn’t be going out of your way to make gold at all until you are 60. A lot of what you said makes sense but leveling fishing doesn’t. It’s about time investment to gold return and you should focus on getting to 60 as fast and efficiently as you can; I’d rather be Level 55 with 150g than level 49 with 300g given same amount of time played. Once you are 60 then that’s when you can make the most amount of gold per hour.
---
i do not know why you where downvoted so much man
---
Goose steppin'!
---
A tip is to kill as many mobs between running to and from quest locations, it speeds up leveling SIGNIFICANTLY
---
100g total - 80g for mount, 20 for training
---
if you are at a certain reputation with your faction (i want to say exalted but not 100% sure, might just be revered) it drops to 90- 72/18
---
It's all fun and games until you start going +run speed right at the edge of a cliff
---
/R/purepwnage
---
I definitely did this back in Vanilla. I wouldn't have done multiple portals, but one portal to IF/Org is no problem.
---
I also sold ports when people were asking for them in trade chat. The reagent costs enough, plus you have to meet up with them to open a portal.
---
You do see where it could be offensive right?  Regardless of having it before that isn't a good argument.  Them suspending you and not just requesting a name change is bs though, I agree with that.
---
the fuck lmao? I'm a 40 enh shaman and I drink every 7th mob or so.
---
He is not moving towards the other player in the video yet gains bonus range out of thin air. There's no way delay can explain that. Did you even watch the video? Let me say it again: he is *not* moving towards the target, yet gaining bonus range.
---
To be fair, I'd probably bail on someone who called me "friend-o" too.
---
Mages are the new hunters ;)
---
Um idk mages are good.... those people are probably just idiots who suck at the game. My buddy plays a mage and he slays.. no clue. Tell them to fuck off. Imo
---
Commenting here so I can find this list later!
---
Ahh thanks.
---
Who gives a shit? It's deadmines. You're level 19. It's not worth the effort. There's shitty people everywhere in this game. Just avoid him in the future.
---
&gt;	even if it’s not as fun, it feels like it’s the better use of my time.
---
I don’t understand this.  You are playing a game: isn’t whatever gives you the most fun the best use of your time?  Who cares about longevity if both the process and result of achieving is it is less fun?  Blizzard could axe WoW classic and delete my account, and I’d have no regrets, because I enjoyed my time playing it.
---
Seriously, this seems like the GM just copy&amp;pasted his responses. I can see this being done by a volunteer.
---
Looks like he’s slow walking too
---
? I quit retail because it was fucking atrocious to do anything outside of raiding, I'm here because I like classic but the brainless stupidity of retail bad classic good on this sub is even more retarded than titanforging.
---
I thought Beeferoni was a dead giveaway tho
---
Don’t stoop to his level. If he continues to act like a shithead he’ll get a reputation and nobody will want to group with him anyways.
---
&gt;Even with the hype behind Classic right now, Retail will always retain a much higher player base in the long term.
---
*Looks at OSRS compared to RS3*
---
Hell yeah brother where else can I get that wholesome Moonguard Goldshire RP?
---
It's low level stuff and most people won't care. Just remember him and stay away.
---
There is zero to a quest or kill 40 boars. If you have a shitty drop rate you introduce randomness. Elated if you finish early and get lucky, sad/annoyed if you get unlucky. In addition to that, you might be able to buy some of those livers off the AH or other players in the zone. So now you have:
---
* Players commiserating over the sucky drop rate in general chat/boasting about how they got lucky (adds some drama and topic of conversation in the zone or guild)
---
* Players being able to buy the livers to bypass the grind and help the economy (feels like an MMO)
---
* Enterprising Players purposely killing the sucky drop rate boars on purpose after they already finished the quest to sell the livers on the AH for money. (Feels like an MMO)
---
* bagspace. Having low bagspace is now a barrier to complete this quest. You need to have open at least four slots for the liver, the snout, the chipped tusk, and whatever else the boar drops. This makes the game more interesting.
---
None of these things exist if instead it is just a kill quest. I like having quest variety over kill this, kill that, kill this third thing.
---
Actually a fun, quick read. Thanks dude. Upvoted!
---
I played cata, after that, I did the same.
---
I dont want to argue. But the world isn't "warrior tank or you're a scrub"
---
You could give them advice maybe.
---
WASH YER BACK
---
Pretty sure pet actually just despawns and "runs away."
---
I'm salty enough for him to be that first negative point on reputation.
---
Ive never once had a problem with my pet in dungeons.
---
I've cause more.problems walking to far to place a trap then I have letting my pet run all willy nilly.
---
Yeah its basically a macro to target a specific persons target. You have the change the macro to the tanks name each dungeon run. Something like:
---
/target Tanky
---
/assist
---
I have thought it was me for a while. However, everytime I get a few seconds to do my thing, nothing bad ever happens. It only happens when other people attack right away, the wrong mob, or generally pull aggro. Shamans do it too with shocks. 
---
I'm an okay tank. Im m a druid, in classic, so I'm not the best or even a good ish tank. I'm a tank that has very limited powers and abilities.  Even fullish feral, I have issues. 
---
But, I've never had issues this bad in any version of this game. Even in classic, when i was a druid tank. I was doing pretty good if not on par with warriors. 
---
I know my flaws in the game. Its retail that has skewed people way of playing. (In my eyes and my experience so far. )
---
The delay is the bonus range bro.. what are you not getting??? Like I said.. on YOUR SCREEN it can be far away but in reality the mob is on top of you. Have you ever watched 2 streams at the same time doing the same content? Mobs are in different locations, it could only be a few yards, but they are in different places due to world MS and home MS.. both put together has a solid MS to delay mob location ALONG with the hard coded 400ms.     
---
To put it simply.. your character is ALWAYS .4 seconds BEHIND what you’re seeing on screen.. think about it bro.
---
hey can anyone tell me if INT in classic makes your spells do more damage, i know it increases crit but i swear i hit much harder than my friend who is elemental, like double as hard
---
It's on them but also you, obviously, you're the idiot suffering the consequences. Take some responsibility for yourself. You provoked someone and they reacted.
---
I'm sorry for trying to be clear about why my opinion differs to yours.
---
You seem more interested in an argument than I discussion so I'm gonna tap out here. Hope your day is nicer than you are.
---
what, he do real now, and feminazis don't exist?
---
It’s not that hard. Plenty of groups aren’t aoe SC, especially for brd. Can always start your own group too.
---
Look at it this way. Armour is just a stat on an item and like all stats has to be prioritised either above or below the others. For an elemental shaman, for instance, armour would be prioritised lower than spell damage.
---
There are so many zones like this in Classic and I love it. The sense of danger and constantly having to keep an eye out.
---
Silverpine Forest - Sons of Arugal
---
Westfall - Dust Devils (to a lesser extent)
---
The Barrens - Alliance Outrunners
---
Duskwood - Stitches / Mor'Ladim
---
Un'goro - Devilsaur
---
I can't think of any others.
---
What happened!? It's %t !
---
Nice dude. I wanted to pvp, so I made a viable class for that. Next hunter.
---
Fuck rouges
---
Rolling a Druid because, hey, you know what I need more than one level 60?
---
Six level 20’s!
---
And the hundredth comment it seems.
---
Those aren't even general purpose either, they're restricted to humanoids and humanoids/beasts. 
---
The only two you could argue are general purpose would probably be ice trap and entangling roots as they can work on any nearly any npc.
---
Your guild just does free rolls on raid loot?  If it's dkp, you'd be using your dkp for your friend.  If it's loot council they're probably gonna know and frown on that for sure.  If you are confused and think that 2h window works in regular dungeons, it does not.
---
Lmfao! I just noticed my typo &gt;.&gt;
---
I like classic, but I might ask the same question about this post and the comment this guy is replying to. Why is everyone in this sub so concerned with jerking themselves raw about how much tougher and more intelligent they are than people who play retail? Everybody needs to chill out.
---
Point of the sniper isn't neccesarily to make the roof impossible, guards drop no loot aswell. Point is you lose Gadgetzan reputation if you kill him, which is a serious disincentive. Perhaps he should respawn very quickly? Not quite instantly because Bloodsail rep, but a very fast respawn would make the roof almost as painful as being on the ground. Maybe even two snipers
---
Look at mr. Moneybags over here with a horse. Then he has the gall to brag about it being rainbow. Smh
---
Eh, I'm not bad. I'm just not great either. I'm limited ='[
---
I've had a pet when I was questing just attack me before a week ago, so I'm not sure.
---
Makes friends with the Horde on your server and ask them to add him to their KOS list.
---
Watch the video before you talk please. The player is out of melee range but moving sideways gives them extra range, delay isn't a factor. He doesn't move towards his target, he moves SIDEWAYS. The mobs do the same thing. Get informed before you start talking shit like this and misinform other readers.
---
So first and only pull?
---
The longest straight I’ve played this game is 10 hrs and I felt like a piece of shit afterwards lol. 
---
Before launch I acted like I’d be constantly playing it, but I’ve fallen into a healthy system as of late
---
Is that pretty much a skipped talent for ret pallies?
---
It drops at Honored I believe, I'm honored with my faction and it cost 90g.
---
I'm still stuck on the fact that you ran Uldaman at level 33, that's crazy
---
TLDR : Questie
---
Oof, yeah. Mages AoE farming quest mobs is definitely annoying.
---
Just what I've asked and gotten back. It's a running joke in discord right now. "How many classic kids does it 5ake to fuck a pug" sorta thing. Not really funny, just kinda sad that no one is willing to listen
---
99% of SM is people wanting to AoE farm. I haven’t had any issues, as a mage, from people wanting to AoE farm. Just got that ignore button on them.
---
r/Arugal Subreddit to a Tee
---
As a mage I'm not gonna lie, I dont like warrior tanks in lower level dungeons. Unfortunately for them, they hold aggro terribly. Druids and Paladins have much better aoe threat generation and I believe its probably based on druids leveling feral and paladins usually speccing into consecration. Warriors just dont hold aggro the same. I dont believe I've ever had a warrior who was full protection spec as it probably isnt viable unless you're only grinding dungeons.
---
300 hours
---
The whole "pull everything at once" meta makes people play really stupid. I was in a dungeon group composed of a holy paladin (me), dps priest, hunter, rogue, and druid tank. Notice that we have terrible AoE, but good single target damage. Yet for some reason, the druid insists on pulling 8 mobs at once. THE WHOLE POINT OF PULLING MULTIPLE MOBS IS TO AOE THEM DOWN. IF WE HAVE NO AOE, PULLING EXTRA MOBS ONLY HURTS THE GROUP.
---
Needless to say, we wiped and of course he blames the healer and leaves. This is why having a meta in games is toxic.
---
We’re at the bottom of a bull market. It’s a buyers market, for sure. But there’s benefits to selling in a buyers market if you’re buying too.
---
Mind sharing your spell rotation for disc leveling.  Currently leveling as a spriest.
---
That's what the healer and I have done. 
---
Ok, you're the tank now. Byeeeee
---
&gt;Me, visibly confused: Of course enhance shamans can totem twist, and of course they're suboptimal.
---
They can't, youkeep spewing this bullshit but its just that, bullshit.
---
An "optimally" geared Enhance shaman does not have the mana pool nor the regen to sustain totem twisting beyond a minute.
---
&gt;You: Even though resto doesn't twist we offer just as much complimentary damage to the melee!!!
---
I said they dont twist because its not optimal, a Resto can twist far better than an enhance just by the virtue of having a larger pool and better regen.
---
This conversation is retarded as are you.
---
&gt;Content is really easy so it's really important that I top healing meters in our 29 man Ony!!1!
---
You are a spastic retard that needs to make up imaginary arguments to try and make them into a strawman to make your nonsensical shit spew seem logical.
---
Its hilarious.
---
&gt;When you wipe to vael because of your enhance shaman let me know, I'd love to see those logs lol.
---
You really think no group will wipe on Vael because of sub optimal damage?
---
You are a spastic retard lol fuck off.
---
They went for authenticity, I won't argue about if they were lazy or not, all that matters is the question: "How far should Authenticity go in this specific situation"
---
i swam it
---
It drops to 90 at honored, but only with your certain faction.  So humans must buy horses, dwarfs must buy rams etc.  You must hit exalted to buy a different faction mount.
---
You ain't paying me lol
---
Again, as per my last response to this nonsense non argument; No, I know what you’re saying. 
---
The problem is that what you’re saying is wrong and unfounded.
---
I’m a level 9 human and I’ve been questing in Elwynn forest. I’m not entirely done there but I want to go do quests in Dun Morogh.  Should I be doing all the way under leveled quests or does it not really matter the order I take on zones and quests?
---
I didn't even realize this was an issue because I played from vanilla to 2/3 through wrath then quit.  As a caster main it would be an advantage to me but I don't think it's necessary. It allows for melees or other classes to sneak up on me without being nuked from 35 yards away.  As it stands with vanilla kiting ranged is already at an advantage already.  I hate to be that guy because I'm not a hardcore #nochanges type but this isn't a change that needs to be made
---
Filthy alliance gaydom
---
If I need a portal from a mage and my mate isnt online, I always give around 50s-1g, depends how important it is!
---
One time I asked a lock for a port, he managed to get 2 more people and I gave him also 1g. Depends how people ask I guess...
---
I don't know what I was expecting
---
That's because you are playing to hit the next level. Just play to finish quests and have fun and you'll be dinging before you know it.
---
I refuse to quit. I like the pain.
---
I played a lil classic but went right back to retail lol i only play for PVP and arena still booming rbgs are running retail FTW 😂
---
Dont trip! Thats funny as hell
---
yea that’s right. thanks for clarifying. only level 23 atm and last bought a mount in ~2006
---
Leveling as a feral druid, will re-spec to restoration eventually.
---
What level should I make the change?
---
Late 50s so I can heal in some dungeons or wait for the magic number 60.
---
make sense ty!
---
You can untame a pet by right clicking it and clicking "abandon"
---
I leveled as prot and even tanked most high-level dungeons(ST, BRD, LBRS, on picture i went to tank UBRS, but i choked at General Drakkisath, though we did it 9-man without one healer, we had literally 0 deaths up to Beast)  
---
11(you need int and consecration)/33/7  
---
Maybe will change some talents later to get spot in raids as heal.
---
theres loot trading in classic?
---
Reading, how does it work?
---

Thank you bro

Just make sure to spread the love man. Whether it be IRL or in-game like I said. Have a good one and ride fast brother.
---
being a warlock doesnt save/make any money... sure i saved 40g at 40 but i had that anyways and still have that left over so it wouldnt have made a difference

Is that you ‘Iamapenis’? I already reported you so you should get that week ban any time now!
---
What do undeads ride?
---
They mentioned that they may in the future add paid realm transfers to classic, hasnt been confirmed or denied and likely wont happen in the near future so i wouldnt sit around waiting for it to happen. As for free transfers, there will likely never be a free transfer from US to OCE, as the free transfers are there to get people off a high pop server onto a lower pop server in same timezone.
---
FAST GOOD RIGHT?
---
Fury warriors are some of the best dps in the game and arms are fantastic for levelling/pvp. Any kind of warrior is awesome.
---
50+ is the fastest right after 1-20.
---
The zones have perfect set up for mass questing.
---
You have multiple dungeons to go for gear you'll need anyway.
---
The only downside really is when you end up on a 20/80 server. Hard to get mobs and hard to survive constant ganking.
---
This was the comment I was looking for. XD

Ah, that makes sense. Thanks.

I got my first ever good buy but a couple of days ago - a sentry cloak for 11 silver. I was so stoked I bought and collected that shit so fast I didn’t even see the sellers name.

I still remember when I got my 99 SILVER instead of gold come back from a Shadowfang auction on classic. Nearly cried.

To me it's always been 30-40 that's been the worst and then everything is downhill from there.

Will just have to come up with a different name I guess. But this really pisses me off that there's no oversight for this stuff.
---
If you're on an RP server apparently the naming rules are enforced. I've had several guildies who have been flagged at least once, but a few of them are on their third name.
---
I think it's also automated, if you get enough reports it auto-flags you, or at least that's how it was explained to me so take it with a grain of salt. I've seen some pettiness with reporting, such as an entire guild reporting non-RP names on people who were griefing their RP event/guild meeting. No sympathy, literally everybody knows the name rules, but if for some unfathomable reason you didn't know this (you did) now you do (you already did so why complain).

It makes things more difficult for an objectively easier playstyle in both PvE and PvP (especially) environments. And this is coming from a caster/healer main in both retail vanilla and classic.

It's so hard to get in to/used to though. Any tips and/or a link to a beginners guide? Would be very appreciated!

Nothing good. Don't worry about it too much.

Wait, you're telling me you spent 10 seconds in stv without being ganked by 4 lvl 44 horde?

---
Nice.
---
It's a fucking game.  Stop whining.  It's no different than being ganked. Play on a PVE server.
---
I tested a little more tonight. The rotation can be slower at some points, which may or may not cost you aggro if dps hit quick. It also works better with a decent sized group of mobs because berserker rage gives plenty of instant rage from getting hit by much more enemies.
---
You can catch a good stride though where you're rage is up and once you pop berserker rage and bloodrage again you're golden. Can keep up a good pace.
---
spammin that ss button like a champion
---
Why would anyone level MM instead of BM?  You talk about playing your class properly and then suggest leveling as MM.  No wonder you had to run around like a headless chicken on trash mobs.
---
Gaming for me is relaxation time, not a chore. I'll happily plod along and slowly run an area, no rushing, helping the odd random player on the side. Besides we have enough god dam streamers now days...
---
Alliance too busy role-playing politics.
---
Melee classes band together and so do aoe casters. It has to do with their pacing. Casters burn out aoe damage with longer resting time, melee will cleave  and burst less mobs but no resting time beside their healer here and there. It's not so much about what is faster as it's about making due with what you got and what is available. Everyone hits 60 anyway.
---
A good guild and friends will always keep you in the game.  If the gameplay isn’t for you, that’s not a bad thing.  There are plenty of other games.
---
I logged into Retail to export some profiles/settings for ElvUI and some other addons, but that's it. I thought I might farm gold on retail to pay my sub with tokens but I honestly can't stand the gameplay and will probably just uninstall instead to save space.
---
&gt; the game’s difficulty
---
Another person confusing tedium with difficulty.
---
Thanks! Been looking for something like this. Trying it out!
---
I'm sorry, but no I really don't; other than people getting triggered because they are way too sheltered. We LITERALLY run through the whole game killing animals and people. What they hell do they think we are doing?!?!?
---
You're welcome.
---
Lmao why not play a warrior if you’re not going to heal
---
I understand that hit rating is crucial for pve, but is it different for pvp?  Is it essential for me to have items such as the ring from maraudon or does hit work differently in pvp

Speaking as someone who's played wow on and off since BC (more off than on) I'd have been alright with BFA if the dungeons just weren't so bugged to begin with. I've understood other expansion design choices and see pros and cons but this one was just lazy imo
---
Well thanks for the support guys. Just pisses me off and needed to blow off some steam. My play time is REALLY limited like I said before, so the hour I had tonight is now gone and the same for tomorrow now with the suspension. Blizzard needs to make some changes in my opinion to curb this kind of stuff.
---
Ah yeah thanks!  That’s what I get for typing up my work on a phone

Run some dungeons then.  Or maybe explore, you can find some cool stuff if you explore.  Or just read the quests and get into the lore.
---
RemindMe! 15 hours
---
Yeah,  that's way two in tents for me, think that proves OP wrong.
---
find a guild. classic is meant to be played with buddies
---
I wouldn’t recommend soloing on a rogue until you’re in pre raid bis, unless you want to wait for AR to be off cool down every pull.
---
or you're multitasking while running/grinding and not really paying attn so you run into a tree or whatever
---
Rogue is also seen by new players as the hardest class to play therefore being appealing to people wanting challenge or competitors since they're so fun in pvp.
---
Not like 2004 rogues which were rogues because it felt cool. 
---
That's like mages being the new huntard, things evolved and spellcleave is just a result of years of theorycrafting from Retail applied to Classic. Cause yeah done well it works.
---
Loot trading was added to instances with raid lockouts. Since most of that content is done with master looter it was more to stave off customer support tickets about misclicking and giving loot to the wrong player.
---

---
Name and shame!
---
Sometimes a droog needs a bit of the old ultraviolence.
---
Wait some of these are very useful, saving your comment for future reference. Thank you!
---
This sounds about right, in a normal run at this point I just multi dot agony since its initial ticks are very low, then I start single targeting what the tank is hitting. If I'm in a group with a mage, I try and help by throwing out more dots/rain of fire, and always end up with all the threat despite still not doing as much damage as the mage.
---
The first guy that responded to you is a condescending asshole. Disregard him.
---
Playing a frost mage is optimal for PvE in Classic because of their total dominance in AoE and slows. I have a few mage friends and I can't even tell you how helpful they are when I'm tanking dungeons.
---
Fire mages, as I understand it, really shine in PvP situations. My recommendation would be to spec Frost as you level, and re-spec if you decide that PvP is going to be your focus.
---
I did this today but for others.
---
I was questing in Ungoro (that tar is soooo sticky (how sticky is it?) that it sticks to the mob and doesn't drop for me....) when I saw not 1, but 2 people call out a hordie (am alliance) who waited to jump others when they were low health.
---
Sure enough, I am finishing up draining the life out of a tar guy and lo and behold, up pops this UD priest with me as his target.
---
He thought he could get me. He didn't. I then stopped farming the mobs that do, but don't, drop the sticky tar, and started farming HIM. After 4 kills, he finally got me once. But I had SS up, popped back up and got him. This was all without the felhunter.
---
Upon my revival, I summoned my felhunter, and it was never a fair fight from there. Got him one more time before he finally decided not to engage in a fight with me again.
---
I sent a private tell to the 2 who deserved vengeance letting them know that I fulfilled it and then some.
---

---
A Fairbanks warlock.
---
If its ?? Then that means its 10+ levels above you. Do you remember the name of it?
---
There are far more qualified people at gold making than me, that is why I dont go in to specifics, and rather just give general direction.
---
What add-on is that?
---
I used to do this and whisper them saying "can I invite you for a sec please I'm setting up my addons?" and they would accept 90% of the time so now I had an easy way to track them on my main character. :P
---
*whoosh*
---
2nd this. Bagnon doesn't even compare.
---
I did 31-35 at Gelkis village in Desolace, quested 35 and 36, then killed Swamp Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows from 37-40.
---
Honestly with all the easy time mages have getting into groups, aoe farming for xp and money...making some water or food for someone should be your way of giving back to all those people who can’t get into groups because they don’t aoe enough
---
Spirit speak wasn’t a waste. Necromancy.
---
Yeah the game is a slow grind but actually feel like there's some progress to my character .
---
Questing is not difficult in Classic. It's tedious because you're forced to interact. Sure, you're gonna have a hard time if you're trying to faceroll some elite by yourself for a quest item, but that's not difficulty-- it's stupidity.
---
Nothing in WoW has ever been hard. At all.
---
Pffy people can fight over them all day. I've been seeking out Rich thorium veins. Arcane crystals selling for 44g a pop. I made 490g in onw day farming them, 5 hours or so.
---
As a rogue, I owe it to feint and vanish to keep my aggro grabbing hands off your mobs.
---
The drop rate is .02%. That's 1/5000.
---
Titan Panel Classic - Combines many useful stats like bag free space, map coordinates, XP per hour, time till next level-up (very motivating!), current cash, Cash in/decrease per hour. All this and more in one tiny single bar.
---
It is, I'm also using it. But I personally believe it should be restricted. The addon is way overpowered. Half of the stuff you can do to hide from enemies in WPvP becomes impossible with the addon. When a rogue goes stealth somewhere around me, I get a big fat warning that a rogue went stealth.
---
It is stupidly broken.
---
That's why you just download other people's hard work from wago.io
---
as a hunter I grinded by killing elite mobs. They give like double the experience a normal mob so I was able to watch something and baiscally afk while autoshooting and my pet tanking. Run to the next elite, pull, watch movie on second monitor.
---
Buy a wand, put 5 points in improved wands, profit.
---
The majority of people that want to raid are still lvl 45...
---
Well currently on classic you can't get in arcane explosion range without getting hit, the range on enemies is 11 to 13 yards or something when you're moving.
---
We (rogues) try our best because no one wants us. I just see “LFM mage preferably” I’m lfg chat so when I’m in a group I try my best to do good dps and throw in some jokes to make the run more enjoyable.
---
In Legion I think they gave it the name "sea wolf." Which sounds cuter than it looks.
---
Oh shit, I thought it looked off. Oops
---
Got any suggestions?  Priest here too.  The southeast corner of arathi is working for now, got me to 35, but I'm a bit bored of it

---
Funny thing is, every dungeon run I've done on my hunter has been with a group of "outcasts". Druid/pally tanks, hunter/rogue/lock dps, etc. and they have been the smoothest runs I've had. No one is super high-strung and stressed out about not clearing the dungeon ASAP. Thing is, we usually clear it in a reasonable time as well

---
I dunno, I was a mage in Vanilla, leveling priest in classic. Been loving it so far, hitting level 40 and becoming a real shadow priest was great too.  
---
I might be a little biased though as I don't have money issues - went herbalism and mining.
---
Horde quest says “to find him go west, then strike east...” uh so I don’t move from here or what man? come on lol
---
Yep 30-45 gets split between 4 or 5 zones across the continents, and generally either north or south. Instances make it better, but questing can be exhausting in that phase.
---
I came to say this too.
---
This took a rather grim turn...
---
these are all Engineering trinkets tho, any trinkets that aren't prof req?
---
I really should, there is only 1 other 60 in my current guild which I levelled in, I made a few friends in this guild and I feel bad just ditching them after I hit 60, but I really should just do it.

Ganking at 10% yes. Camping instances, unlikely due to horde overpopulation.

---
Today I decided never to pug with mages because of that. I have mages in my guild. I trust them. I don't trust some rando gnome mage on a mission to make me want to punt him. As a shadow priest sometimes forced to take healing roles, this is absolutely infuriating.
---
How so, I remember getting warned for ganking people from suzkwopd rooftops back in the day.
---
It definitely looks rock hard...
---
What’s the correct attack rotation for a combat rogue in PVE? I see so many different claims to be the best online and I don’t know what to do anymore. Just going for highest dps possible.
---
Is there a reason to use lures once you hit 300? At least right now in game? Serious question. I can't seem to find a definite answer.

---
Nobody said they cant do that, but its a difference between -&gt; tank pulls 2 packs, line of sight them all on top of each other and after some seconds they start throwing their rain of fire and blizzard in AND the mage is already pulling the next pack while the warlock already spamming hellfire before the tank is even done with the last mob and has no time at all to "tank".
---
AoE is not the problem and I had groups where the tank took his 10 seconds before they spammed their aoe spells into the pack and it worked fine for everyone. Because this way everybody gets to play their class.
---
ooooff take my upvote with your dirty comment...
---
"Threat Plates (Classic)" is my go-to. They use the threat tables, which are mostly accurate, but also have an option to use their heuristic for situations where the threat tables can't be relied upon. It's a really comprehensive addon.
---
Portals between capitals on my server are usually 60 Silver and portals from places like the badlands go for 1G.

How do you swap a new bag in?

Seeing how the person leveling in the pic is an Orc, Ima go out on a limb and say Horde can probably do it too

If you don't want the TradeSkillMaster bloat, Skillet has an alpha version that's really nice replacement for profession UI.

Tame a cat from thousand needles (or check petopia) they have 1.2 attack speed. teach bite claw growl. GG.
---
Faster dps means low attack dmg according to 2.0 cats but it taunts faster with attack and a nice buddy to defend you from enemy casters.
---
Badboy probably.
---
Run speed means more time on target.

Following u/nezbokaj's lead, the capital O's are 1s, the lowercase o's are 0s.  It translates to:

I like that the imp's name backwards is man rat.
---
Yes. You also just might be completely unable to do so however depending on your race.
---
Depends on how you’re lvling. If all you do from lvl 55 is run dungeons as a healer it’s a good idea to respec.
---
Firstly, the only reason you pick any points in ELE, and really the only talent we want is elemental fury, and the reduced Cast time of LB and CH,  there is really no difference you will notice if you went full resto beside you cant kill ANYTHING in any reasonable time.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55000155030015--0523031100501](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55000155030015--0523031100501)
---
Btw this is more a "caster" pvp spec, you realistically cannot play resto in PVP, you have no survivability + no damage
---
Let me try and answer some questions.
---
1. If your taking points into ele, you're not going to be healing outside of lesser healing wave &amp; NS+HW, PVP in classic is kill or be killed, the idea of a healer sitting in the back healing just isn't a real enough thing, aka, spec ele and do some damage or be useless.
---
2. In PVP your not dropping all 4 totems all the time, it's more reactive.
---
3. No.
---
4. One is after taking a crit hit, the other is passive always, you decide how valuable healing focus is, like I said if you're just standing in place to heal, you're already dead.
---
5. That's a massive no.
---
5 points into purification isn't worth it, it only applies to base healing, not +healing
---
Hey so what's the leveling experience like for a priest as shadow? I want to play shadow but can they also heal in shadow spec for duengons?
---
damn, that's a shame. I'll put an edit in, but looking at the level distributions i think it might shift them slightly forward, but not to a seriously significant degree.
---
God, that media player skin though. Modern software is such a double-edged sword, it's more efficient but it's also... More efficient, try getting a fun Spotify skin like that.
---
Wait so using an addon is try harding but fake casting your hearthstone isn't?
---
Is this addon just simply called 'cancer' ?
---
All you need to heal is healing spells.
---
all these retail zoomer mages ruining my good name. i hate it.
---
1g. Always. (except in dungeons)
---
Now THIS
---
is pod racing
---
The hit cap needed is lower in pvp but arguably more crucial. You can throw a fight or even a bg match by missing an ability that would've killed a target and giving them just enough time to kill you or receive healing.
---
Not that hit cap in pve isn't good, it's very impactful on your dps. Missing an ability once at a poor time probably won't cause a death or wipe though.
---
Why no gnomes
---
May your shield hold strong and sword bite swiftly, little one.
---
Decreases likelihood of your fish getting away. Iirc level/ boosts do not increase your chance to get rarer catches, you're just more successful in catching things.
---
I mean, I feel like it's a necessity as a prot warrior. What good is a silence if you don't know what the target is casting.
---
Now that i agree with, its really bad when it comes to rage spent for dmg.
---
I'd say warlocks are probably the least gear dependent of any class in pvp to be honest.  You don't need an uber weapon like a physical damage dealer, and you can still decent damage by putting dots on the enemy.
---
Someone has made a good fishing macro that they dropped somewhere on this sub...
---
Can confirm. I always load first so by the time you can even see your character I'm already half way done killing it for a second time on the boat.
---
I had a mage exactly like this in ZF the other day. He was doing my head in so I told the rest of the group (who were all guildies talking on team) that I’d put him on /ignore and had no intention of tanking mobs back off of him if was gonna try and pull them. They all agreed with me, we were near the end so didn’t see the point in kicking/replacing him. Finished it quite nicely once I’d silenced that headache. Funny how he couldn’t seem to grasp that pulling 10 mobs at a time and wiping wasn’t as fast as pulling 3 mobs and not wiping.
---
NSFW!

every single brazilian ive played with in retail has that "GOGOGOGOGOGO" attitude. every single one. i tell them to stfu and if they wanna set the pace then they can tank. biggest reason i love classic: we're not paired with br servers
---
Anyone know what a skinner/leather worker should do to make gold? I sell as much as I can that I produce on AH but that’s it.
---
Leveling as a shadow priest is super fast
---
&gt;Retail is what it is now because it's what the majority wanted, not the minority  
---
  
---
Didnt WoW subs peak in wotlk? I think that alone already proves you wrong.
---
I think this _heavily_ depends on the player and playstyle.
---
Being locked into only one playstyle is one of the fastest ways to kill enjoyment of a game for me. It's not that I want to be "everything", it's that I love exploring different ways of playing and solving problems.
---
These are far easier than Burning Crusade dungeons, you at least couldn't AOE those without some decent gear.  I can see what you mean.
---
Thats when you BUY those who undercut you, and put them all up on the AH - making 70g + profit each.
---
Runescape is a piss poor comparison.  Rs3 was a bastardization of the game that the boys loved.  Huge mechanical and gameplay changes caused tons of players to outright quit.  Osrs was a major move that played out well because it's what the majority wants. 
---
Retail and classic are two faces to a coin.  There arent major mechanical and gameplay changes between the two.  Just quality of life and convenience.

Do u think it's worth it to reroll? I have a 40 human rogue but not really liking it anymore. Also I want to faction change to horde but not really sure
---
Thousand Needles has at least two of these quests.
---
OP, what addons makes your character UI look so simply beautiful?
---
It is funny btw when you try to level without the quest helper in retail. Because you will instantly realise that it is impossible. The moment they made the quest helper a thing, they also stopped giving out directions for you. So they say "Go do this" or "Go and speak to that person" who can be god knows where. But they don't tell you because your map shows you.
---
"today, let me show you how i exploit and break the ToS. ill even leave my character name visible!"
---
There's literally no verifiable source behind that claim from Superdata. Blizzard stopped releasing that info years. Even so, there's no way to verify if those were for recent WoW patches, retail promos, etc. Also no way to determine drop off and active number of players. It doesn't mean anything, really.

Just play however you like.
---
As for you OP, just because you have alot of money for your level doesn't mean anything. You've already outlined how you've spent so much time on AH/mining/skinning so whats the point? It's not that you earned money faster. You levelled slower.
---
That one angered me greatly...
---
Also the one in Thousand Needles that says 'find and kill this elemental, he roams Thousand Needles'...
---
War rock. Well thats a name i haven't heard in a decade
---
While leveling i only keep the two highest ranks of normal heal, highest of fast heal and highest of any special heals, for example chain heal in my case. This way you can choose to use a lower level version to top of a group member. For downranking on 60 i can recommend watching Melderons downranking guide on YouTube. It helps to understand why it is useful, when to use and how you can check for yourself at what points of +heal a certain rank is more efficient than another. It helped me greatly.
---
I believe this is possible in the default blizz settings if you use raid frames when in party
---
An individual group isnt forcing anything you are right.
---
However if this happens to become the "normal" way of doing something, other people will do it as well.
---
Its a chain reaction, just look back at "SM 10 man raid xp grind".
---
Some people did it - all fine nobody cared - quickly people got hold of it and more and more people ran 10 man raids for xp -&gt; a day later people had difficulties finding a normal group for SM to get their quests done because it was all about people looking for 10 man raid cleaves.
---
So nope one group doing SM in a 10 man raid with 8 mages and 2 priests isnt hurting anyones fun at all. But at the point where this is considered the way to go and if you are a hunter for example, you wont be accepted for those groups because you arent meta aoe cleave, people who have the correct class will join the 10 man raids because its the "best way" to play the game and you will spent much much more time to find enough people for a normal run in the end.
---
This is hurting other peoples gameplay, because aoe 10 man was meta and other groups got mocked with "lol why you do 5 man its stupid, better do 10 man".
---
I generalize the community on my server herod because this is what you experienced there.
---
You're right that the pet will normally take back aggro, but the mob being wing clipped has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
Confirmed. First stack of squid caught. 2 month later
---
Not if you intend to PVP, but it's garbage in PVE. Certainly nothing spec-defining like Mortal Strike or whatever.
---
That's sad. It was always a pretty BS mechanic in a game so much about PvP.
---
Same. To be fair he’s probably incredibly young, but yeah, still sad.
---
In general the time taken to quest level to 45-47 is about half way to 60.
---
AoE farming or dungeon spam are not considered in this regard. They may end up being faster.
---
On average my 50-60 was 4hrs per level.
---
Haha I was the mage, actually, but I'm sure his bleeding is still going strong. I'll ask if I see him again.

---
Nah it's not that far-fetched. I'm enhance and am just shy of pre-bis and do around 300-350 on bosses. The 300+ dps boost he is talking about is Improved Str of earth and Improved Windfury totem total damage increase across the 4 other melee in your party, which is prob more along the lines of 150-200.
---
Basically, you are able to add any increase of damage the shaman brings through utility to overall output of the shaman to calculate his actual worth in the group.
---
Having a shaman doing about 100-200 dps less than rogue or warrior number 11, but making up for it through utility makes having one worth it.
---
Just abandon backstab and go for two cruel barbs

This is true, worth noting that wands vendor for more than a lot of 1h weapons as well

So basically the void walker ran the long way around instead of jumping and pulled every mob in the dungeon right?

Then learn to stance dance. The only ones complaining are bad tanks. The reason I know this is false because when I play with good tanks, they sure as hell know how to hold their aggro.

1. The Druid is geared independently of the warrior tank. 
---
2. The Druid in shapeshifted form resists polymorph.
---
Lol, that must have been a sight to see :D
---
level 43 with 60g doesn't feel great.
---
That was great.
---
Why would you assume melee leeway activates only on motion in a particular direction?  (It could never work that way because of the latency issue to begin with.)
---
You can disassemble the code for yourself in the WoW vanilla client and see that the checks for leeway is that the player is "running".  That means movement in any direction. It's been done.
---
Ah I remember I encountered this behaviour on the vanilla private servers, there was a group of two players doing the same kill quest as me and they refused to invite me. Then I managed to ninja tag the boss also pulling a few ads, they threw an invite only at this point so that they do not have to wait for the respawn. I declined and managed to finish the fight with something like 50hp left, definitely sent them the message.
---
Yes but frenzy procs with a higher probability for BT because he hits more often, pure math. So he should have a higher uptime on frenzy than any other pet thus have the highest dps?
---
Maybe I'm wrong.
---
It’s the least broken as hunter, you can already see everything vis minimap tracking.
---
I wish there was an option to check on the server balance when deciding on a transfer. I picked it due to "low" population on the hours I used to play but now that I play later in the day I can definitely tell there are a lot of Alliance high leveled.
---
Dam ty warhorse looks bad ass
---
Yes but if you think about it. If you don't kill the turtles, the lions will obviously have enough food. So there won't be any starving hulking lions anymore. Rather you should kill more turtles to increase the number of starving lions to kill.
---
Shadow is a super smooth leveling experience. Solo wise and healing 5 mans.
---
Maybe you should list the reasons people don’t like it instead of trying to paint a false picture.
---
Reasons retail players don’t like leveling in retail:
---
Little character progression
---
Dead levels out the ass.
---
Nothing new after WoD till your capstone talent at cap unless your a DH.
---
Content has been done out the ass.
---
Not hard, so it’s boring.
---
Not everything was scaled correctly and random bugs pop up where a mob one shots you just because, doing 6X your hp in one shot in the open world, at your level.
---
Removed content like artifact weapons powers and talent tree means legion is just there to level and quests, ruining part of that expansions enjoyability. 
---
Psychologically 120 levels will always feel like a bigger grind than 60. Even if 60 takes longer.
---
Why are you getting downvoted LOL
---
1.3m ppl ruffly plays wow if the information is correct
---
Do you happen to know a good talent build?
---
For having butt in the name? lol
---
You are confusing real world values with the game. Go outside, stop playing for a while. Seriously now, you are going to destroy your brain.
---

The real PVP is in the comments

Can you say dragged?
---
Fucking say it.
---
Undead on a raptor is all i want
---
And it’s alliance as well? What the fuuuxk maaaan
---
I saw a dude who's pet was called My Ex Wife yesterday, thoroughly enjoyed that
---
damn,the last part hurts :( but yeah,understandable =/
---
He's just covered with a patchwork blanket
---
No.
---
Good luck burning down Tarren Mill, friend.... ;)
---
Yeah i don't remeber if vanilla was like this, but in classic red and skull differ for pvp vs pve
---
I'm maining a mage and I disagree. If you need it, hit need.
---
You’d be surprised how prude american companies are. Had my DK named Ebolaids once and had to rename, then tried Ebola, same..
---
Not sure I've ever attacked someone that was otherwise minding their own damned business. 
---
But I love PvP servers because the scum that enjoy ganking are easy to detect and camping the dogshit out of them is the sweetest fulfillment I've ever experienced in WoW.  The milk of basement dwelling troglodyte's tears sustains me.  
---
Typically I try to avoid doing this in places like STV and hillsbrad though since if you're there you're basically asking for it.  That being said I still don't attack people just for shits and giggles there, no reason to be that kind of shit stain.
---
Is that a setting or an add on that highlights players name based on class? How do I get that?
---
I feel like it’s almost an anomaly to not have at least 1 person like that in a dungeon run.
---
It literally says in the post you linked that it's "as if people would have experienced it", as in there was a change made to artificially introduce lag into it. You can however literally compare the two videos linked and see they are nothing alike. You CAN NOT cone of cold+arcane explosion a pack down in classic like you could in vanilla, the mob melee range makes it impossible.
---
Other than having no bag addon is cringy, I don’t get it.
---
 Noob here - What are greens?
---
You do feel bad until the next mother fucker ganks you while your 50% on a mob 🤬
---
*Arcatraz has entered the chat*
---
Getting under SW is something that they decided to leave in because it was Vanilla like lol
---
when you about to Arcane Explosion but she keeps zug zugging harder
---
&gt; but I don’t think it’s fair to get mad at people for wanting to farm quicker.
---
It is fair when they assume **every** group is an aoe group - which is what the OP is talking about.
---
You spelled opinion wrong!
---
I keep mine open about 85% of the time minimum.
---
I have a level 14 enhance shaman, LW and skinning, just enjoying something different. My main is mage.
---
Should I down rank any of my priest spells while leveling/dungeoning? I haven't had too much trouble dungeon healing with max level spells, but I definitely run out of Mana while leveling.
---
Am mage.  Having lots of fun.  Established my reputation early as a non-idiot mage.  Also give out water for free.  Funny how not being a prick is how to get groups in this game lol.
---
I only don't partake in it bc modern blizzard is very ban happy
---
Lots of salt but lots of truth.
---
Blizzard.
---
I see things like this and ask myself why...?
---
Yeah its cool being efficient, but I could totally see myself getting burned out quick doing this.
---
Just seems more fun being in a party with friends on discord and having a laugh while doing dungeons.
---
Damn fire packs man... Golemagg was a joke, melee didn't even get enough stacks to explode.  But fire packs?  Ugh....
---
I wish I could turn into rogue, warrior, mage or a priest instead of cat, bear, OOMkin or "are not allowed to cast HoTs or you would replace some enchantment procs, like crusader in a 22 buff limit, that enchants use too without showing icons of it"
---
Owls are better.
---
Like the comic says, retail is more about the goal than the journey.
---
Try jumping over an edge.
---
Awesome
---
Different people find different things more or less fun. It's fine to not don't understand it, there's probably a lot of people who don't understand your preference too.
---
I was in Hinterlands earlier and a HUGE spider appeared out of nowhere and scared me to death lmao. Love it
---
Like if they want to be fast they can just bandage themselfs and pull while you drink. So annoying seeing other warriors at 20%hp waiting for heals that drain mana and now I cant do as big off a pull with healer mana not being full.
---
Iirc you can keep 4/5 frenzy up 100% with any cat. I think with BT you can do 3/5 in the talent.
---
That's why I usually don't allow pets.
---
Grab a damage meter addon and try: opening Garrote (if okay to take up a debuff slot) into SS and doing a 2 point SnD. Then SS to 5 points, SnD, then keep up SnD while Eviscerate with remainder (Rupture if high armor target + its fine to take up a debuff slot).  
---
Or just open up with 2x SS (non-stealthed) into 2 point SnD, SS to 5 points, SnD, then keep up SnD and Eviscerate/Rupture as usual.  
---
That's what my thought process would be like, although I'm not level 60 yet so I wouldn't know if either are the best. Could also play around with a 1 point SnD instead of 2 point SnD at the beginning and see if thats any better.
---
Try a different class. I felt the same way with Hunter, leveled a druid instead and now level 42
---
If I had a guild I would kick whoever has been offline for more than a week. Because at this point, this signals you being inactive af. 
---
On another note, my sister logged into her character on retail she hasn't played in 8-10 years and she is still in her guild. And the guild still has active members. Was quite funny.
---
Wait, how can you tell? The level ding obscures most of the character.
---
Wrong. The journey in retail isn’t leveling, the journey is grinding in PvP, Raiding, doing Mythic Plus, Collecting. The goal is having completed your preferred content.
---
Stop teasing us, when is this anime releasing?
---
Well yeah if you give dragons drugs they're gonna go on a rampage.

---
Personally the best customer support I've experienced was in Eve Online. But Blizzard is good as well.
---
SM runs are typically around 50% XP bar + anywhere from 5-15g if you want to break up the questing monotony.
---
Plus I didn't get it on a Rogue... &gt;\_&gt;
---
You mean /join SpamForSMSMSMSMSMSCLEAVEEEEEEE autism.

Seriously, there's always several idiots spamming SM 4 times in a row which is off-putting and makes me not want to read through that to find any other dungeon.
---
I’m horde on this realm and it bums me out to see the way that the server pop is headed 😞

I use this macro to dismount me if mounted, swap to battle stance if I’m not in it and charge. You need to mash it a few times.

Thanks for sharing your journey, was a pleasure reading!
---
This is fucking dumb. I rolled a mage in classic because it sounded fun and I wanted to get away from Hunter that I mained for so long. I was so sick of the hunter stereotype so I wanted to switch it up. Now you guys are circle jerking mages. Reddit always needs to bitch about one thing and in wow it's always the bugman privileged tanks who think there hot shit because they play a special role. Get a real losers stop stereotyping one class to blame all your shitty tanking ablity on. Been there done that tanks are the hands down the most stuck up players in this whole game.
---
You can tank ony with fury
---
If he can't solo it, he shouldn't be there and you shouldn't feel bad.
---
Fair cop.
---
r/kerning
---
It doesn’t seem like you play retail or you’re purposefully being obtuse. 
---
If my Goal is to down the final Mythic boss, how is downing the first one on heroic the goal?
---
In Mythic Plus if I wanna push to the highest of my server, getting gear and climbing up the key levels is part of the journey. The goal is getting #1 on the server.
---
I've unfortunately started to see this more and more in classic. It's really started to rear its head in UBRS.
---
Most end game alchemy recipes are going to come from either drops or faraway vendors rather than rep grinds.  
---
You'll want to do the scholomance quests to get the vendor who sells the major mana potion recipe, and the major healing potion comes from a vendor in Everlook.  
---
Elixir of the Mongoose comes from satyr rogues in Felwood or Azshara.  
---
Check Gadgetzan if you haven't already for your philosopher stone recipe and some transmutes, and start making arcanite as often as you can.  
---
Flask recipes have a very small chance of dropping from end bosses of ubrs, strat, and scholo.
---
As far as I can remember, no alchemy recipes are bind on pickup, so check your auction house.  The drop rates for recipes are low, you will definitely won't want to farm them all.  There are plenty more recipes out there, but these are the best money makers, or at least they were 15 years ago.

Nice!

https://classicdb.ch/?talent#he0ux0hoZVibzq0ux 
---
So i designed this build for what your talking about battlemage style. I love the idea that you have too although this doesn't rely on chain lightning or LB. The biggest downside to me is elemental devistation requiring spell crit. But i feel like if you weave in shocks as much as you can youre bound to get a crit and get that talent to procc. Not sure if this is a pipe dream, feeling like it is but i might try it anyway.
---
This is designed for dungeon lvling and pvp fyi.
---
I also made a version where CL and LB have extra crit, downside is you dont have reduced cast time talents.
---
&gt;Mage: Drink a potion.
---
&gt;Tank: A what?
---
&gt;Mage: A rage potion.
---
&gt;Tank: There are rage potions in this game? 
---
&gt;Mage: Yup.
---
OMFG 😂😂😂
---
This is amazing. Streamers are the worst
---
Because in the world I live in, when I look at things, there aren't abstract name plates floating above them. A game needs to decide when to use abstract representations and when to make things a little more realistic. I really like the nameplate system as it exists in vanilla, in particular in PVP or in the now densely cluttered areas of the game where it makes mobs harder to see (its like camouflage, and I enjoy that). If STV had nameplates everywhere, it would be significantly worse in my eyes.
---
you shouldnt down rank any damage spells as a priest, if you are going oom you are probably not wanding enough. usually you just shadow word pain -&gt; wand, and ocasionally chuck on a renew, bubble or mind blast.
---
My alarm is set for 11:30 and reads sELL hONOR gEAR from who knows when. I can vaguely remember the reason, I'm sure i was just a min/max whore.
---
At least he asked, on my warrior unless it's a priest I usually reject  group requests
---
If I see someone out solo doing a quest in the area I try to toss peeps invites to help reduce the stress on the area. The more people in group for tags, the faster everyone gets out of there, lol. Plus I find better loot tends to drop for me in groups.
---
I do this for horde.  Finish durotar, then hit tirisfal.  Green quests are honestly the way to go, especially as melee.
---
I play retail on Frostmourne and Classic on Yojamba, can confirm.
---
Your higher rank spells are always more mana efficient than lower rank heals if you don't have any plus healing. All ranks of a spell learned after level 20 get the same +healing from gear as all the other ranks. You also need to take into account how at low levels your higher rank spells generally lead to you getting more time outside of the 5 second rule.
---
As an example, If you have two ranks where one does 300 healing for 60 mana, and one does 600 healing for 100 mana, the second one is more efficient per mana and will give you more time outside the 5 second rule over a long fight. But if they are receiving 200 healing from gear, now they are 500 for 60 mana and 800 for 100 mana. The first rank is now more efficient, but you may lose regen from having to cast more often. 
---
Everything changes in raids and with good gear, but I like max ranks for most leveling dungeons.
---
I agree. At some point it starts to wear on you. Go to a zone, pick up a kill quest, a fetch quest, a deliver a message quest, a collect quest. Complete quests. Go to new zone. Rinse. Repeat. There is no challenge other than "I hope that mom doesn't wander to close because my class doesn't have any tools for dealing with more than one thing hitting me at a time."
---
Think you’re just looking for an outlet to your rage lol. If you’re using “tank” in the same context of a cleave group you seem wildly misinformed on what a cleave group actually is. Your point seems to oppose bad threat management, and bad groups in general. Nice straw man.
---
Which is understandable but you’re a priest and have the luxury of choosing who you party with.
---
Aside from a huge pull in Cath what runs are you doing where you’re actually OOM when there’s poor threat management. If you’re utilizing mp5 properly even the worst groups would only test mana on 3x pulls where things get real ugly. If that’s happening just recognize the state of the party and leave.
---
Sticking it out with a bad group while going mental boom is a terrible look. Either leave or don’t complain.
---
OP is entirely correct to say some healers are bad, but refuting with what ever your agenda is, doesn’t hold against that. If anything helps to validate his point lol
---
Also you could pickup professions. Like fishing. Tailoring and enchanting and work on them. I went tailor/herb on my lock but I know my priest is gonna be alch so I just wanted to have the mats when I changed over.
---
Certain talents increase healing of one spell like druids with healing touch becoming super mana efficient later on. But I also noticed on my pally around lvl 24 flash of light rank1 is more efficient than holy light rank1 so just do some math first.
---
Let me ask a wow veteran, does things like this happen in retail?
---
Pally asked group for water in BFD. As a hunter I had no problem giving him my last 6. He left the group not a minute later.  Just another day in classic wow.
---
Yep. I talked about this many times in regards to multiple boizzard games. Its absurd, pathetic and blizzad should be ashamed IMO.
---
Does faster atk speed help interrupt npc casting or only pvp casting?
---
Do you want him to walk you there too?
---
Literally just your opinion, I love leveling up multiple characters and meeting people along the way. End game raiding is over-rated, it's mostly waiting around, wiping, and repeating the same stuff over and over to try to get some purple or orange gear so you can stand around in a major city and show everyone. Way more interesting to quest around the world meeting people. This is what killed retail, nobody cared about traveling the world and questing anymore, it was just dungeon after dungeon with no community.
---
As the tank you set the pace. You can take input, but the pulls are down to you.
---
Own it.
---
At least its a workaround for now. Of course it should be fixed in the future
---
Stop fortnite dancing you normi!
---
The anti mage circlejerk started by all these boomers that cant pull more than 2 mobs at a time is boring now
---
This guy knows it. 
---
While solo i use max rank earth shock when i get stormstrike for that increased nautre dmg.
---
I’m referring to good customer service and enforcement of rules accurately.
---
Don’t get too bummed. I’ve been playing as much as possible and I just hit 40. I joined a random leveling guild to have random people to fuck around with but I do plan on hoping a guild that does proper raids within a month. I’m sure there’s lots of people in the same situation as me. Give us some patience
---
I like it.. your one seems more balanced between ele/enh but still feels true to battlemage...
---
Think of STV as it exists currently. Then think of an STV where you can see nameplates of your targets and distant enemies. 
---
Do I need to structure an argument about how one is immersion breaking or has it made itself apparent? One feels like a jungle. One feels like a crappy looking video game. A game needs to decide when to use abstract representations and when to follow the real world, and I think the nameplate range in vanilla is a perfect demonstration of them doing a good job at meeting in the middle.
---
and here, we have an example of gnomish 7-bit computing
---
Thanks!
---
Much appreciated
---
Oh no? So they just automate through programs cause it isn’t stopping them spamming me
---
Yup, that's your only hope. I also learned that if you wait for a certain moment the agents will spread out enough for someone to pull the first two only.
---
Ever watch a bad movie remake? Same concept.
---
I believe it’s pvp only. Didn’t notice a difference in pve.
---
The last boss was hella thing with a 41-43 level group the first time I was there
---
2 or 3 hours a day with a friend, no guides or questie, and we're 36. I think your assessment is probably accurate
---
Definitely true, what's really funny is the ones that move in groups are the worst PvPers. On Stalagg, I can usually 1v2 most Horde, after I win multiple times in a row... Usually 2 more with the same guild tag show up and it becomes 1v4. 
---
Alliance definitely has the higher skilled players on the server.
---
Lol. Nothing joker has done is impressive, and being content with Basic Bitch Blizzarding like you are is the first stage of playing mage. I'll stop feeding the troll now, you're clearly brand new to this. You don't even have the mana pool to Blizzard pools of this size (30+ mobs) even with 7k mana.
---
Joker is the type of player to pull out with ONE resist, wheras you cannot avoid at least 5 per pull when you pull 20-40 mobs, and then it would never be possible to Blizzard them because you can't recover when the resist do happen since you can't overwrite the Blizzard slow.
---
Go away now. With that shitty spec I would be dead three times over in the first 3 minutes of the video lol.
---
A lot like Wit, in the Stormlight Archives.
---
Idk I hit 50 went deep prot and it's pretty easy now to hold aggro I just charge-demo-gernade-demo and begin to tab target everything with either 1 sunder/revenge/shield slam if I have the rage worst case I lose 1-2 mobs I taunt one go battle mocking the other and hit um with sunder/shield slam but I agree if you aren't prot your threat generation is no we're near the amount you need to deal with the amount of aoe that comes out
---
Leveled with a cat, there were plenty of times I wished I had the higher threat generation of owls.
---
Gnomer was fun because I remember it being a long instance and I had all the quests lined up and several hours set aside. I never did Mara and joined a group thinking it was like a normal instance late at night. Longest slog of my life and nothing dropped. It was fun for a bit but by the time I got to Princess I was a zombie.
---
Only pvp
---
PvP only.
---
Hope you never planned on playing in BGs...those waits are gonna suck for Horde.
---
Int is mana and spell crit chance.
---
Bucksquick? More like Fucksquick.
---
Here i am, cant evem get neutral with them
---
Not really sure what youre asking but I think you get it you just miss understand the terminology.
---
You have 8% chance to miss. When you get 8 hit. You no longer have 8% chance to miss. Meaning you do have 100% chance to hit on anything thats not a crit/dodge/block/parry/glancingblow. It will default to a hit after it rolls for those things because you can no longer miss. The so called hit cap is because you only need the stat "hit" 8 times. (except you actually need 9, unless you have 5 weapon skill)
---
Not sure if that clarified things for you.
---
I'm 10 essence of earth away dude. grats!
---
What quest is this? Or just something you made up?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zVcGqZVibzV0z 
---
This is the LB CL build i designed, edited it tonight and i think it could be really awesome with some great talents in there.
---
I feel this way with the speed run meta of raids. I don't think my brain could ever find it interesting. I mean even in retail the m+ leader board meta barely has 1-2 groups legitimately competing for the literal fastest clear speed. To each their own, but I don't think it adds any level of depth to the game even though it's adding a layer of "competition". The whole thing is just bizarre to me
---
I actually leveled till 10 without Questi, and I’m extremely proud of my self!
---
Im not going to sit here and pretend that it didn't trigger me soooo fucking hard though.
---
Maybe I’ll make a video tomorrow to show you how a real man mage farms.
---
&gt; Onwards to 50 and then.... The world!!!!
---
TOKI WO TOMARE!!!!
---
Exactly... it's just as easy to keep your healer at 80% as it is 30%. Then when shit goes bad you don't all die.
---
Yeah wait till Kazzak comes out hehe
---
I’m a hunter who made the great decision to do skinning and mining.
---
Same. And im back to it on friday....gonna suck...
---
This is awesome. Thanks!
---
I know,right...=/ That was sad to watch... :( Pure Tooga
---
Okay Pussytrees, I will.
---
To start with mages with such attitude do not go into long conversations. The just give blizzard and after it ends blink in give flames trike and start Arcane blasting until they break aggro from you, then they go frost nova and run around Arcane blasting till mobs or their own death. If blizzard part is skipped, frost nova given too early or resisted a d mobs are really tough like bigger mechs in Gnomregan, there is little you can do, unless you are a feral druid tank with mass taunt (10 min CD).
---
Most mages don't understand that to make AoE farm effective there must be minimum two of em and to pull half of instance then need 4 mages and a healer, but their frost nova usage must be perfectly distributed. Single mage can only clear packs of weaker mobs like scorpions in Uldaman.
---
then quit, this is how it is and how it's gonna stay. you don't like it you gotta move on
---
https://youtu.be/lZqvD-s4qGY
---
It really is the only possible choice.
---
Well you're not wrong.
---
Probably the tank, but you should still watch your threat and throttle accordingly.
---
I think in the coming months a lot people will have their eyes opened to the reality that most warrior tank players struggle hard with threat generation.
---
You can see it already with people like asmongold opting to get carried by his healers as a dw fury tank.
---
&gt; Literally just your opinion. 
---
Proceeds to give opinion like its some how more valid.
---
also "LF3M mages and holy nova priest Torch room!"
---
That's horrible advice. If there's only 1 other drop on the AH there's no reason to assume that person knows the items value better than you. 
---
If there's multiple items on the AH you shouldn't undercut by 50 gold.
---
owl is best but you need screech or not worth. its pretty much demo shout, generates agro and reduces dmg taken towards the owl.
---
Titan panel makes about 5 or 6 of OPs addons useless.
---
Nah, you get weapons with hit, crit and spell damage later
---
This is something that was in the game until they patched it. I think they patched it in like Cata? No one got banned for it, it's not a game breaking exploit. It doesn't let you kill people and prevent them from reaching you. It's just a glitch that lets you get underneath SW. I did this on my Paladin until I realized you couldn't actually get out from there because there were no docks in Classic so I killed my character lmao.

I got my first mage portal to org from badlands yesterday. I realize theres some reagent cost to the mage but I have no idea what it is. I just asked general if there was a mage that would mind portaling me for a tip. Got an inv and the kind stranger did it for free!
---
No, I’m retail everyone is a snarky brat
---
Haha i was thinking the same.  
---
Fariic, go BM for leveling. Its night and day.
---
This is silly.
---
Think. If a company sees that an older version of the game brings in more consistent users ($) than the newer, what do you think they would do?
---
A) Remove the newer one and add in to the old one features that made them money (Cause people to unsub from both)
---
B) Make the newer one more like the old one while keeping the money making features (Potentially gain more subs)
---
C) Let the newer one continue its path causing it to lose users.
---
Isn’t default bind shift 1 or ctrl 1 to attack and shift/ctrl 2 to return. At least that’s what I use

Had a good group last night in cath. I told the new healer the rogue is a notorious tank and that healing him is optional. Got laughs and the healer basically focussed on me the whole time and the run was smooth. Did 10 runs with that same rogue.  
---
As a tank you kinda have to accept you won't have threat all the time. 3-4 mobs tops if you're lucky, and even then the dps will still find a way to pull from you. It really doesn't matter too much if they die as long as your heals has mana, plus they'll probably be more careful next pull.
---
Not really sometimes the pet pulls when you have zero mana and complains about mo heals
---
If the only thing you look forward to is pixels, look into outdoor/indoor non-technology related hobbies, socializing, and exercise. They will revitalize you and shake you out of your existential wage slave depression.
---
Lok’tar. 
---
And that raid on .org was weak. it was funny to watch him QQ about layers, graveyards, etc.
---
Thank you for your response. I think we found the answer why people think Classic is more fun then Retail. It’s the people that play it.
---
Last expansion before they decided to start pidgeon hole-ing specs almost to the tune of classes.  I logged into my old chars and it immediately struck me how similar wow has become to D3.
---
They're different markets, the homogenization garbage is bad.  Still I consider vanilla to be somewhat of a early build, TBC is launch.  Finally unfucked their absolute cluster item stats, (cloth with agility and/or strength anyone?) Druid items with feral attack power (vanilla had this, but blizzard screwed it up by making *every. Single. One.* a one handed item except Atiesh.. so what goes in the off hand? A blue book.  What about sets? Not *every* warrior in the raid can be tanking, too bad! War t1 through 3 is all tanking.  This was finally laid to bed in BC.  By WotLK they had stuff rocking, with itemization knocked out, talent trees were fun and interesting, and hey you can be almost any spec or class and get some love in a raid.  
---
Then Cata.  Well shit talent trees are a huge part of wow.  I know it's a theme park mmo, so the only choices I get to customize my char post design is talents, I don't want to be forced to choose one of three instead of 71.  I can only hope blizz fixes this.
---
Yeah I’ve seen a little at lower levels too but not bad yet although I’m still hesitant to run with pugs in dungeons  might need to actually try to find a decent guild now I think
---
Jesus, the Foresaken are fucked up.
---
Won’t matter - Horde outnumber Alliance on almost every PvP server in the game. 
---
Only on PvE servers is it close to 50:50
---
You know what... you're all just being little shits now.  I hope you feel like big boys and girls with your "K". Just know that you're not always going to "K" your way out of situations.  There isn't just this magical "K" button that makes the conversation disappear.  Geez
---
Thunderbrew Boot Flask

---
Wow!
---
Exact same card and setting my dude
---
Most growth in BC. Highest peak in Wrath.
---
You have the same card, monitor and in game graphics specs as me, are we twins?
---
eh no. I as the tank warrior will top the damage meter. That's just how it goes.
---
im on here but cant seem to find rake
---
That’s gonna be some good beef at a later date.
---
I hit 60 a couple days ago and felt like I was late to the party at the time, but of course a couple days later I realize otherwise. I'm not willing to leave my guild to join one of the guilds snapping up early 60s so I'm just helping people level.
---
I don't regret pushing to cap fast though, it was good times. Didn't take time off work or anything crazy, though I am a bit sleep starved.
---
Illusionary rod isn't bis imo. Hypnotic blade + oh (that from Thalnos or the warlock/mage quest reward) are. 
---
But yeah, don't expect stupid power boosts.
---
I do the same but no botting involved, just multiboxing.
---
And it's really hard btw, I have to monitor 5 screen at the time and quickly click. (In fact I can monitor and click to subset of the screen due to videofx)
---
After 10 min, my eyes pops out.
---
It's a little like that but without the big blooper so a lot more demanding.

ya, this is that building
---
So I think I saw one of your previous posts and was interested in trying this out, so I looked into the steam link info, but was confused by what I read.
---
They say this only works if you're on the same WiFi network as the computer "broadcasting" your game. You say you can play away from home. How?
---
It seemed that I might need some special hardware, like a controller that attaches to my phone. But you seem to be just using your touchscreen. How?
---
And, finally, along with that, how have you created this interface for your phone. Is there something in the Steam Link ?software? that is a tool for making these kinds of modifications?
---
Sorry for all the questions. If enough people are interested, maybe you could make a tutorial video. I know I'm definitely interested.
---
well yeha you're a mage you didn't think you would be mainly hitting people with a staff right?
---
How is the RP server bloodsail buccanears? Wanting to try RP out but not sure
---
Alternatively you can go first 2 points spirit tap, 5 wand, rest to spirit tap, then work your way down the disc tree taking improved PW:S and improved Stan buff, inner focus, mana regen while casting. 
---
Reason being is you should be only casting a couple spells then wanding the mob to death so the early shadow talents aren’t worth while (even mind flay as it costs a lot of mana). 
---
For instance I go: smite ( or holy fire once you learn it), mind blast, SWP, then wand  from there on out. By the time the mobs dead my mana 
---
is near full and spirit tap will get me the rest of the way while I move to the next target. Might toss another mind blast in there too. 
---
Eventually at 36 (min) you respec shadow because mind flay becomes more mana efficient at rank 3 and go from there. 
---
Going shadow off the bat is fine, but I found this to be more mana friendly and efficient with your time as your not having to drink all the time.  Just one option. 
---
Priest discord has a lot of information i
---
You have to loot the recipe and craft it yourself with Tailoring.
---
Try an Undead Warlock if you like the class but want a more interesting lore vibe to it.  Or maybe try Hunter if you like the pet but prefer more direct damage to dots.  If you liked the Gnome but want the non-caster world, Rogues and Warriors are fun.  
---
Or for about as different an experience as possible, Tauren Druid.   Alts are an amazing way to play WoW.
---
Stop classic shaming him! /s
---
Well a boar really makes no sense for a Worgen racial mount. They aren't really a common mob type in that area.
---
Just began the grind for mats. May the rng gods be kind
---
So far I've done the shaman water totem quest and the alliance aquatic form quest.  I hate everyone and everything.
---
That’s not me doing me. By your logic leveling is the goal, not the journey. When in actuality for people who want to level, 60 is the goal leveling is the journey. So for raiders Mythic Aszhara is the goal. Progressing through the rest is the journey.
---
I don’t get why you think in retail of all places that leveling has to be the beginning of end of “the journey”. (Especially when you can skip it).
---
Not all of us are as skilled as Zen'Kiki
---
some classes are less gear dependant, rogue and mage for example.  try to pvp as a druid with crappy gear man, its hell
---
Whirlwind is soo nice to gain threath. Really weird to see "dps" warriors opening with it since they said they could not tank... Usually tell them to whirlwind after they see me do it.  I charge -bloodfury/sweeping strike - berserkerrage - whirlwind - def stance. 
---
They charge - whirlwind. Before I can get ss up. Aight dude, we just swapped roles gl tanking
---
That's why leveling doesnt belong in retail and its an outdated system. Retail has become about the challenge of raids, dungeons, and PvP and the people who still play it tend to enjoy those aspects of it. Not the leveling, it's just a tutorial stage to unlock the real game. 
---
Classic will never have the end game complexity of retail because it's a 15 year old game thats endgame has already solved. Thay may both be called WoW but people need to stop saying retail is dead just because it isn't the game they want to play anymore. 
---
Classic would never work without a leveling mechanic because leveling is the whole game. Retail could, that's the point I was trying to make. Leveling no longer makes sense in retail.
---
late 20s / early 30s are dark times. get into SM asap. dungeons are your friend.
---
There's a lot to accomplish solo at 60. There is also plenty of bis gear to be had from dungeons that aren't strictly 60-only. So there's stuff to do. 
---
I enjoyed leveling with my friends (though I did lead them by 5-9 levels most of the way) but even in classic I wanted to be at cap because that's where the game is for me.
---
I swear especially cats and rogues do it on purpose. Maybe it's boosting their damage numbers if they attack the same mob for longer periods and they just take the mob that will be attacked the least to go up in the damage meter, but it makes me furious.
---
I spent a lot of time running around underneath SW, I was always scared though because my friend told me I'd be banned if a GM saw me down there or somebody reported me, iirc it extends all the way to Dun Morogh.
---
Just run SM until 40. Sell all the cloth and goods on the AH. It will be boring, but it will go fast.
---
You that kind of orc?
---
Yeah I'm used to mmos where weapon upgrades are nice power boosts I guess.
---
Just wanted to make sure I wasnt missing something here.
---
Prismatic punch card quest in gnomer has a message 'encrypted' on it.  Look it up too! I won't spoil it for you.
---
Damn why are your 970s so bad? I have it set to 10 and still get 200+ FPS.
---
I would fit the xpbar ober the Actionbars.
---
They look so funny on Orc males and Tauren haha.
---
The "I dont have time" excuse is so annoying. You are asking people to do a certain quest or a boss and they tell you that. Also, as a mage I found out that priests are the most "pull more mobs" guys don't know why :D It's funny cause I tell people im not AoE specced and that I dont have ice block or ice barrier and they still get surprised.
---
I'm also a noob and ran out of flash powder lol. Hey it's late.
---
I'm new to the game sorry lmao
---
ive been using that background since classic was announced
---
I think the reason people don't talk about Arcatraz is that most didn't finish it unnerfed. I remember summoning over a full raid in there for the quest complete after me and a group completed it.
---
I got killed by two rogues yesterday in STV. A lock tried to help, but got killed as well.           
---
            
---
Right after that, he goes “to the fucker who ran away when getting ganked by two rogues, I hope your family blah blah blah” and I’m like whoa dude, chill.                                        
---
             
---
But inside I’m like “firstly, bitch, I’m not running away, it’s a tactical retreat, I’m a god damn druid, and secondly, gnome, I was ganking one of the rogues and it backfired because I suck”. Regret not kapowning him with words
---
ive tanked every 60 dungeon boss as druid, its not a problem
---
I think it depends on whether you view that character as just another person trying to play, or as a member of the opposing faction taking your resources
---
Please someone comment on general chat, that’s gold.
---
Or the Goblin race car one where you need to go from Shimmering to BB/Gadget like four times for some meh gloves and at a level you don't have a mount

Man I was salty about that.

Now you look the same as every other hunter.   I kept my Durator Tiger.  1.2 atk speed is fine.  And I feel like I am adventuring with my old buddy that has been through it all with me.    :)
---
Was in a ZF run today and I asked for water (I was healing) and the mage goes "tip pls". 
---
I gave him 69 copper. How are you gonna ask for a tip from your healer while you're in a dungeon lmao.
---
I wouldn't listen to this person. If there is a small sample size, then the price would be completely off. They might be massively over or under priced for all you know.
---
Kill beasts in stranglethorn vale. They drop greys that vendor for lots.

That's what que time is for

Hehe...thabk you, mate!
---
Just crafted mine today too congrats!
---
...what Rank is your pets Claw?
---
50:50 it either happens or it doesnt
---
Because it's not the same game meant for the same kind of players. Retail players dont play for the leveling experience so no matter what systems are in place to ease that portion of the game it still feels like hours of slogging to get to the current game. Classic is built around the leveling experience and exploring the world and lends itself to those who experience that style of play. 
---
The game has evolved to fit a different playstyle that many people enjoy. That doesnt make those who dont enjoy leveling desire to play end game content any less valid.
---
How are you investing 2 hours into food? Get your meal prep in order, my dude.

You are using vw sacrifice when you are hellfiering though right? In my experience mobs are usually dead before the shield break if you have positioned well.

At first i thought his name was beefform. That would have been cool
---
Possibly, as long as you got speed pot and boots and can manage keeping ur DoTs up, you can "THEORETICALLY" kite her for a while... 
---
But the extra shadow dmg from SM or DS makes the job take a lot less time.

Ots the same for me sometimes n im running the intergrated intel thingy

Look up some YouTube videos on pick pocketing runs. Im pretty sure you make a good amount on just going through and PPing SM Cath
---
I meant they did in retail, its just one of many quality of life changes that were stripped away for Classic.
---
I actually just cancelled my sub after 1 month. I had alot of fun leveling a paladin to 42, but I found the game dominates my spare time too much.
---
I'd rather not look back and wish I had been more productive with 1000 hours.
---
Kill mobs &gt; loot &gt; vendor. Preferably mobs that are involved in some kind of quest.
---
Or just dont do gnomer its not worth it boys and girls it just aint
---
wow people really will believe anything
---
If this isn't a new bug as of about 2 days ago, just destroy the mines before the explode. Ez.
---
&gt;Point I was trying to make was that the lower ranked spells are good enough with some added spellpower to heal MC, they are also good enough to heal lower level dungeons without the extra spellpower.
---
What? Where is the logic here? Those two statements literally have no correlation.
---
&gt;DPS being the thing that slows a group down, if they don't have max rank damage abilities. Low rank healing does nothing to clear speed, might save the healer from going oom is all.
---
???????

I am a warlock, and I approve this message

Ive never wiped there so far. I always kite them back as we fight thus keeping a distance from newly placed mines

Stop spending your gold on the ah you should have 100g by now, grind dungs though isnt a bad way

Save your gold and just keep lvling till you have it. No reason to stop and gring gold

I ran into a melee hunter while questing. Super friendly guy. He said he had played a hunter since WoW was first released. I guess he just wanted to try something a little different.

 Here's 10s to eat my cock a balls. Get to work whore.

Try /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear() as the last line.

I feel like if you wanted to show off your gear you could have just done that. Everybody else does it here, no need to be ashamed.
---
Is the title supposed to be ironic? Weather was one of the most post topics for the first two weeks after launch. It's all there, you just have missed it for some reason.
---
That made me chuckle IRL hahaha ty
---
Yep, both me and my brother played back in the day. I like Classic but he prefers the faster paced content of Retail now. Not a bad thing. Can't blame someone if they don't want to put 10 days+ of gametime to get to max especially if they still have Retail content they wanna do.
---
Most of the player base is 40.  You have to wait for the general population to hit 60 first.
---
I don't get how they're doing this one tbh.
---
standing on the bookshelf I get because the guards can't get you, but they're standing directly next to.the vendor and never pull aggro.
---
I understand your point, however I dont think its realistic to assume that this should be something people will always do. Because "clearing mobs for a clickable item" is a pretty loose definition. You cant expect people to accurately judge wether youre killing the mobs for the chest or not, and it also presents some difficult questions, like how far away do you have to be to "claim" an item? What if theres multiple people doing the same as you? If two people approach the item from different directions clearing mobs, then who has the precedence? 
---
It all just feels a bit too arbitrary to me.
---
I’d rather be great at 1 or 2 roles than mediocre at everything 
---
I played Druid in vanilla and the only reason I didn’t reroll was because of the grind.
---
Fite me
---
IIRC there's a certain boss in BWL that specifically requires a feral tank.
---
He will be leached like 1.12 Kazzak was unfortunately
---
At a guess having not been in a similar situation myself, I *think* the correct response in that situation would have been to spam "stay" as soon as you realized your mistake.  Then you could have either used Eyes of the Beast or Dismiss/Call Pet to safely bring it to the group. Or if it already made it to some mobs you could have let it die, prayed that it didn't have certain buffs on it that would generate threat on a party member, revived then fed it.

Sorry im new to wow as well, but what darnassus repeatable quest is he doing? Is it just cloth turn ins? Interested to do a few of these 15min quest to get some rep

This honestly was what broke the camels back for me and made me quit my warrior at 47. Just couldnt deal with it anymore, someone else can tank :(
---
Yeah thanks man.
---
You can order the auction house by % if market value, although that’s pretty unreliable without scanning regularly(and currently with the unstable classic economy). What most likely happened was someone using the TSM addon sniper function for items under vendor price.  This function refreshes the last page of the auction house for every new item and tells you if something is under the price of your parameters(such as under vendor price). It is not automatically bought but the deal is presented basically seconds after posting and the player can then buy it by clicking on it(or whatever macro they can set for purchasing). It’s not as powerful as you think, nor automated gold making, this was just a rarer scenario.
---
&gt;Not wanting to waste time, I tell him to control his aggro because i would not be healing him mid battle.
---
Holy shit dude I would be shaming you. Nobody like a egotistical diva.
---
Exactly this, I actually felt they were great at giving directions. Remember the directions to shrine of Azura?
---
Wow nice, thanks for the update!
---
Zug zug
---
Mind control always leads to great shenanigans
---
i have no idea about the armory working or not, my understanding was it didn’t work. i know they have already blocked addons showing ilvl so it doesn’t become a feature of the game. 
---
i believe ilvl creates a toxic elitist environment, where nothing else matters but ur ilvl. not part of the classic model.
---
Now put the song "im gonna be" over it and we have a masterpiece.

Today, a dude ported back to SW to spam lf group in the city chat. I was confused but now I think he didn’t know about LFG.
---
New to wow and I have made a pretty big mistake atleast I think not leveling my professions in a undead rouge with leather making and skinning both very low level now my question are these professions good? Do I get new ones or do I just grind and get these up?
---
Juke the pummel
---
Best horde race for warlocks?
---
Yep gotta catch the sacks of shit in the act or you'll just be chasing them forever.   Also helps if you know where they're going, best case scenario have track humanoids AND know where they're going.  But to be honest if they're getting jollies killing people more then 10 levels under them, strategic thoughts are outside their conscious sphere so it comes down to how ready you are to commit.
---
Wrong
---
simple words for you then....LOW RANK HEAL IS OKAY IN DUNGEONS IT DOES NOT AFFECT CLEAR SPEED.
---
Boys, I spotted a not-so-rare asshole!
---
I've seen a lot of generically named pets, but my favorite is the cat pet owner who simply named theirs "Dog".
---
its the same on my server the only way to lvl is through dungeons, horrible questing experience
---
This is absolutely not true, I don't get why people keep repeating this or where they got the idea.
---
Me all the way to the stable master at 40
---
RemindMe! 10 hours
---
So adding layers (that brings totally new ways of interaction with the world) is in line with #nochange policy but fix clear bugs is not. Yeah, seems logical.
---
This is all fine and dandy, but how would you know hes actually doing his job and not being a doubleagent for the opposite faction?
---
I'm really not. If everyone is taking damage spread out and not focusing a target, then it's a lot of healing. Maybe you just haven't been with really shitty groups.
---
Wait. is your character actually larger than before?
---
Get a cockroach. The way they flap around is hilarious. Basic snake is nice too.
---
i literally watched this episode like 45 minutes ago... amazing
---
Orc/Troll/Undead are all super good, pick whatever you think looks the coolest
---
Yea, that's not how frenzy works.
---
To be fair on blizz, they gave you alot of cosmetic ways to make your character feel like yours in cata compared to the earlier.   
---
A lot of new mounts = everybody isn't riding the same tiger/ wolf  
---
Transmog = YOU can use how you look, blizz isnt forcing everyone to look the same   
---
Barber shop (think it was cata right?) = New haircuts and stuff like that, if you wanna RP that your chr is having a emo phase then you can do so without doing a new chr  
---
So I would argue you actually had more RPG choices in cata then vanilla or TBC for example (non gameplay ones, but still RPG elements none the less)
---
As I wrote somewhere else, I was sending more healing on him than on the tank, and he even made the previous healer leave, probably because of that.
---
Inventorian
---
I’m not sure what you mean. Did you level up so far that you can’t skin mobs your own level?
---
No professions are really ‘needed’, except for engineering if you’re very serious about PvE or PvP, though skinning has probably made me a good ~100g 1-60. I’d definitely recommend atleast leveling skinning up.
---
oh ok, thanks for your contribution
---
1-44 is the same XP as 44-60, but generally the latter half goes faster.
---
Lol you will not find fire mages in pvp. You should be the one disregarded.
---
TLDR; lower rank heals do now affect clear speed like lower rank dmg abilities.
---
I dunno, I feel like retail makes you play more, except if we're talking dungeons. You have to log in to do dailies. Here, in classic, I can log in whenever I want (I'm on a queueless  server ;) and continue where I left off without feeling I missed out. Sure things take longer time, but the journey is the fun part, why rush it?
---
Still not answering the questions.
---
I've been running dungeons as heals since level 13 so I doubt I have been lucky enough to only have good groups. I have never had problems with mana.
---
Yep, if you click on the backpack button in the top left you are able to separate by bag, or you can separate by item type / make your own subsections.
---
Arch Linux with Lutris. Works perfect
---
whojamba?
---
You have to switch the game to Classic on the battle net launcher.  It's set to the current retail expansion by default
---
I'm pretty sure he realizes this.   Common knowledge
---
hahaha i think you played on my server back in the day!! i was horde and felt like i always was seeing you little fuckers!
---
Lmao I'm guessing you've never once played a healer. But I'm glad to know psychics are actually real since you magically know whether I'm lying or not, without even reading my comments too apparently!
---
Fuck you, Shoresy!

You still get the stam trinket from 1 loot.

In Brill last night, someone came up and asked me to tell them a joke. I told them the only joke I know. They laughed, and then gave me three silk bags!
---
Same. Start selling quest rewards and green drops. Dont d/e anything lol
---
Like they don’t blow up instantly, it’s like 3 seconds, if you have a good enough rogue he can deal with them OR have everyone stay ranged of mobs and just let the tank take the mine hits and the rest of the group just nukes the dark iron dwarfs.
---
You must be real fun at parties.
---
My internet and PC were pretty bad in late TBC too. If I went into org it would just straight crash.
---
Luckily my friend played with me and had better 'net so he would log into my account, move me where I needed to be, then I could log back in.

Fun times.

Good ol’ ASUS ROG laptop

---
World first was china
---
That's just wrong. You can stormstrike just fine with a twohander, or even with a 1hander and shield.
---
Maybe you're thinking of Lava Lash from WotLK?
---
You can also make it jump first with Eyes of the Beast, leave it on Stay, then jump down after it and set it back to follow. It's a faster cast, so if you're quick with positioning it'll turn out faster,  plus it won't reduce your pet's happiness.
---
Bartender turns the whole button red, and he when you dont have enough mana.
---
ClassicThreatMeter works fine, just people need to have it installed too.
---
What do you have bound to x tho
---
Great work man! Still trying to get to 60 first, but hopefully will be in a good raiding guild for progression :D
---
What else do you do in your free time? Hobbies? Outdoors? Friends? Cut down on screen time to benefit yourself.
---
People say that but I highly doubt blizz will dedicate the resources to maintaining two concurrent MMOs. If they progress through the previous expansions what happens to classic? They aren't going to maintain retail, classic, and classic  TBC. So that means classic as we see it now is gone and there will be a huge divide among people who dont want to be forced into TBC. So let's say they do progress through the expansions despite the vocality. When do they stop? TBC? WotLK? That's still a finite amount of game. 
---
The most likely and hopeful scenario from a perspective that treats Blizzard like a company out to make money (which it is) is that they take the lessons learned from what the classic playerbase enjoys and find a way to incorporate that into the future of retail to bring players back.

Financially it just doesnt make sense to develop new content for Classic. New content requires significantly more time and resources than maintaining old content and they aren't going to split thoss limited resources to dedicate to new content across two games that serve the same demographic. Classic will always have a dedicated fanbase just as private servers did but  I'll eat my monthly sub if any new content is developed.

Not having to buy water or mainhand weapons helps a ton too
---
I work on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska bering sea
---
Nobody is talking about damage spells.
---
But both healing and damage spells are literal trash to downrank before you are a decently geared 60.
---
Ooooooh look at you, a true hardcore gamer lmao
---
You’re so superior to those normies playing retail aren’t you
---
This is a good tip! Only it's windows key + P, not control. 
---
Unless my computer is whack.
---
Doesn't even have to go that far, 50g respec is atrocious. Can't raid and pvp on the same toon without fountain of gold
---
Its funny the only thing i i have spent gold on is the 5g for skinning 225+ and for alteric swiss/giant eggs for artisan cooking which wasnt a lot. Other prof is mining which hasnt cost me either.... i figured id have a lot more at this point
---
Because asmon is being obnoxious on purpose and that makes it funny/enjoyable. For comparison you're being obnoxious by accident and that makes you annoying.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
How the hell is your game so dark
---
Tell them to fuck off especially if there's just 1 mage. If you've got 3 mages fair enough, but otherwise just do reasonable pulls.
---
As a warlock I’ve lost a lot of things in retail that I’m loving in classic. The big one is a variety of curses. Elements, shadows, tongues in PvE, recklessness. Plus some other class specific flavor such as shadow ward. Now, don’t get me wrong, there are some newer abilities I do miss. Particularly demonic circle teleporting.
---
Exactly, and I hope OP doesn’t try and defend that fact. Literally the average player base is like lvl 40 and some servers haven’t even killed onyxia yet. So being in the top 0.1% of players who are that geared is just showing off your gear...if you were like level 43 in blues and one epic then maybe it would be justified.
---
To use some harsh reality I think you're just being way too sensitive and victimizing yourself.
---
In both cases you tried to interact with someone who was already having a rough time and got blocked for it.
---
Dont blame issues like Cancel culture for this lol
---
Troll can't be warlock. But as he said all races are good.
---
nah you're wrong because you're stating that you're 'locked' or forced into one play style (or character) and you're not. But just like real life if I want to be an expert piano player and an expert painter and an expert surfer then thats a very hard, tedious and time consuming thing to achieve so most people have to choose one and commit to it. If I want to have a level 60 mage (for example) then I have to earn it. 
---
I guess in an ideal situation there would be a lot more world content to level up to but that might be to the detriment of the rest of the game.
---
That's not entirely correct as you need to account for combinations of different numbers. But the odds of everyone rolling the same particular number are 1 in a million.
---
&gt;They say this only works if you're on the same WiFi network as the computer "broadcasting" your game. You say you can play away from home. How?
---
* So, the same network only applies when you are first setting up your Steam Link. It's just so that your phone can recognize your computer. I believe. Once it's set up, it doesn't matter what network your phone/tablet is on, it will connect to your computer on home on your home Wi-Fi.
---
&gt;It seemed that I might need some special hardware, like a controller that attaches to my phone. But you seem to be just using your touchscreen. How?
---
* You do not need any controller for this. No additional hardware is needed to do this. Though, you *can* play with a controller if you so wish.
---
&gt;And, finally, along with that, how have you created this interface for your phone. Is there something in the Steam Link ?software? that is a tool for making these kinds of modifications?
---
* This interface was simply put together all through Steam Link and everything it already has to offer. There are configurations you can use that are prebuilt by others. That's actually how I constructed mine, I just modified someone else's. If enough people are interested, I can even upload this exact configuration so others can have it or modify it to their liking too. The Steam Link's interface isn't too hard to navigate and figure out how to modify it to your liking though. I did spend **plenty** of time tinkering with this until I got it to my liking though.
---
So that's how the Titanic crashed
---
This is the answer you are looking for. Since you have skinning its perfect.  
---
I made so much gold of these ridge stalkers and the coyotes they should implement a title called "Beast Grinder" and hand it to me.
---
Reminder to me
---
Will give it a try thanks. Faction imbalance has been an issue...
---
There's a sound effect too when it happens, sounds like a bag opening.
---
These numbers are heavily inflated by bank alts.
---
40g is a fairly good price for the tiny emerald whelpling. There's better places to farm for gold so I would just buy it. I already have a menagerie of pets since they are insanely cheap atm.
---
Quest exp always existed in Everquest.
---
I think the argument of "I paid for the game therefore I should have access to all of its content" is what makes the current version of retail so boring to most people.
---
I had just finished helping someone in STV and was running back to duskwood for flight path when I saw a shit lot of red name plates running down the road, they were around level 32-38 and just jumped me lol.
---
Have you got any special settings via the Nvidia overlay thing? Any filters?
---
I feel that, man. Just seems like procrastinating doesn't exist when you're a kid, because, well you can't procrastinate "growing up" - it just happens.
---
They should cut off horde creation on servers with anything over 2:1. That would balance it out real quick.
---
But ya know, it might affect subs so that would get tosed out real quick.
---
It's almost like people don't have as much time to spare as they used to and prefer faster experience. To each their own.
---
Downtime every third pull? 
---
Cries in warrior
---
Tooga, at Tanaris, when the quest failed
---
Thunderclap is also affected by the 0.8 threat modifier for having to use it in battle stance. Not only does it cost heaps of rage, it does almost no damage, of which the threat is then reduced by 20% it’s literally the worst threat ability in classic. Nerfed demo shout is better!
---
Thanks beast grinder!
---
If not, shadowuf is the simplest, nicest, most well rounded standalone unit frame addon.
---
undead hands down
---
&gt;I keep seeing hunters standing around in melee and it’s heart breaking
---
Meh it's nice in caves/places where things respawn pretty fast.
---
oh god its annoying, the moment you permit them to do AOE they just spaz around like they've come straight from COD quickscoping to this, the mass efficiency crowd attracts clowns
---
Why?
---
This is really cool. I still have my first character and make it a goal to at least level cap it each expansion even though its no longer my main. Wish I still had my old screen shots.
---
So in the event that a warrior pops a FAP, you’re just going to let him wail on you?
---
Unreal, deal of a lifetime there
---
TO TE TU TO TE TU  TAAAAM!

They are all in dungeons or in town AFK. After reaching 40 this was the case in every zone.

i'm beginning to think that perhaps the scarlet monastery were right

I have completely stopped trying to feign into a trap.  It never works.

If you look through my post history you'll see I have tons of hobbies! Drawing, skateboarding, biking, camping, photography and video games!

I'm just saying WoW classic is tons of fun and I have been having a great time after work (who likes Mondays?!) playing with everyone who seems to feel the same =)
---
My computer crapped on me so im playing super casual on an older set up till I can get a new rig so im still barely 18...

My buddy was server 1st 60. Lol.
---
Commenting for later
---
Fair fight
---
Gg
---
No rematch
---
Yep. I get the "No changes" crowd but I think it will hurt the longevity of the game. Some QoL changes are necessary to allow players to experience all the game has to offer without pigeonholing themselves into one type of content. 
---
I'd love to see dual specs or removed/reduced costs of respecs among other changes put into classic.
---
Stand as one! FOR THE ALLIANCE!  
---
*Sorry I love that animation too much. :)*
---
I have no clue what the key bindings are for your hotbars.
---
I have always wondered how people bind so much stuff but I don't understand what things like N1 mean for example.
---
Not really. Shadoworiest is still shit for raids. If you really need to buff your warlocks than holy weaving is more useful for your raid.
---
200 hours is slow as fuck wtf
---
There wasn't an armory in classic. If this is true it's going to be the thing that ruins classic.
---
It’s probably gonna be easy to notice. Will make you some enemies and prepare for your name to be spammed in all chat and be called a ninja
---
Game play matters as much or more to me.  My character could literally be a log, but with amazing playstyle choices I'd be happy.  I actually don't give a crap what my mount looks like or what color my character's hair is, I just want to try out a unique non-cookiecutter template and then bust my ass to make it work better than anyone else's spec flavor of the month. 
---
Cata took that away completely, and I subsequently burnt out after max level at the time.  Put the game that I tried to spend every waking moment on since 04 and didn't even look back.
---
Ilvl existed in vanilla as an interface option
---
Neon green is the color of evil.

You were probably just bad

maidens circle is also like 200g+. But yes kind of, if you care to min/max

Again?  This was posted five minutes ago!

If you did this as a dwarf id be impressed.

It should integrate into any unit frame default or addon. For default, make sure you are showing percentages or whatever from the options menu.

I won't start it, but if you do initiate it with me, I'll probably be crying at the end.
---
When i first tanked Ragefire i was like Lvl 14 but didnt completed the Quest since i tought i also get defstance and taunt from my trainer.
---
During the run the other warry told me he already got taunt with lvl 12, then it dawned on me.
---
It was an interesting experience.
---
I hear can’t touch this by mc hammer in my head watching this.
---
The other guy didn't quite explain it.  The Gnome needed to grind exalted reputation with Darnassus by presumably doing all Darnassus quests while leveling and then grinding or buying rune cloth for turnings.  Then buying Tiger Riding from Darnassus.
---
Then he went to Winterspring and did the repeatable quests for Winterspring to get to exalted.  Which is in itself a long grind.
---
Wotf mostly, orks stun resist is good but it is chance based and chance is not so high
---
Thanks. But no thanks.
---
I find it much easier doing 50-60.   
---
It feels like you roll into a zone and there are a ton of quests just waiting for me all in one location without requiring me to go cross continent. 
---
Un’goro is definitely a place where you get a dozen quests in a fairly compact map area and just about any creature you kill potentially will go toward some sort of quest.  
---
Dungeons starting with ST and definitely BRD give you the opportunity to level up while also getting items that will be pre-raid BiS. Maybe it feels like it’s faster because some of the things you accomplish will stay with you for a while at 60.
---
I always knew that the MT was a different instance entirely, but why is it?
---
This is the one part of the sub I don’t get...
---
Ain't that the truth lol
---
Longer maintenance is for retail though?
---
Love them! Love them all!
---
First time? If your group can make it to the end, make sure you set apart ~5 hours. This is inevitable.
---
I was 10 days played at level 49. I ain't abusing shit. I don't like it either but you are throwing a fit and calling it something it's clearly not.
---
Right on the money for reactions that give gamers a bad rep. Grow up man.
---
This really isn’t something worth getting worked up over dude.
---
~430 hours bro?
---
Just because the police wears bulletproof armor doesn't mean you can shoot them.
---
You are still responsible for the things you say. If people are offended by the things you say w they have the right to report you. Having a profanity filter in place doesn't mean you can say what you want. Know your audience and adjust your language or stop speaking.
---
No that was something that only came into being in Wotlk as a player made addon
---
Deepholme was pretty awesome, that's one of my favorites in the game, I really liked Twilight Highlands too
---
wow u talked for so long with this retard.

bombruns wont work with only one character capable of aoe.

Consider that there's literally no other comparable subscription MMOs and they moved to a content model that enables and encourages people to come back for only one month every 6 months for a content patch (or every 2 years for 2 months for an expansion, treating each as like a Call of Duty  campaign). It's not about "fans" shitting on them for not keeping consistent subs. It's about investors. Investors are stupid and short sighted and often don't actually understand the businesses they invest in. Better to not report subs when they're no longer something that makes you stand out against competitors, and no longer accurately represent your business model.
---
Calculating exp/h is a detriment to my fun/h scores though.
---
I mean it’s only really useful in PvP and if you’re pvping as a prot warrior you lost anyway
---
&gt; You forgot to talk about how much skill classic requires
---
Do people actually do this non-facetiously?
---
Rip to the meta, 15 years along time
---
Gz!
---
Warlocks are worse. Don't wait for the tank to establish aggro and just stand right in the middle of the pack Hellfiring pulling all the aggro.     
---
You simply cannot heal stupid like that. They die before the first heal gets through it's full cast.
---
No, thank you!
---
Using dominos you can transfer action bar to any shape or size you want
---
Ammo and old pet AI, so glad they are gone tbh
---
Maybe before demo fix, now you will fail with 4 + mobs often.
---
I definitely don't think it fits the "without changing how the game looks" aspect of this post but I cannot recommend Luna Unit Frames enough. It has a feature that shows who has aggro, makes your buffs and debuffs on allies and enemies bigger in the UI, shows incoming healing, and a ton of other QOL features. 10/10, would recommend, especially if you're healing or tanking.
---
Cut down on friends so that u have more time grinding in wow
---
You make an outstanding jump of an assumption here. Well done Internet man.
---
Is there a way to filter for classic?
---
Oh my bad
---
Yeah all this talk about fluid talent trees and wacky combinations but I'm not about to drop piles of gold to see if this wacky combo I have isnt worth it.
---
I'd be fine with a 12 hour talent change cooldown for free but a paid talent change whenever.
---
What's wrong with Draenei chicks with dicks?  😉
---
yeah i don't see them lasting long, but of all the classes you decided to fill first. You picked hunter....
---
Hunters were never a commonly played class. But you don't need many for a raid so it always worked out.
---
I do think that mages/warlocks are more dominant than they were in vanilla though.
---
When you go into sell tab of auctioneer what is difference?
---
I was just thinking Fivesunders would be a great warrior name today.
---
lmfao 40 shamans?! why the fuck even
---
Dude...I'm not even saying that you should downrank before 60 or decently geared.
---
I'm saying that if you are 42, doing SM cath, you could easily have healed the dungeon with only level 36 spells. Meaning that a level 36 healer in SM cath simply simulates a 42 healer downranking his spells. You are not going to wipe, you are not going to clear slower, you are not going to be "trash".
---
I'm a rogue main, I keep all water and mana pots I find for when I am grouped with mana users. I regularly open trade with out saying anything and put water and pots in for then to take.
---
If that doesn’t work try 
---
/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 5
---
I can’t remember which one works for classic
---
I'd disagree. There are plenty of instances in which I want to silence the appropriate spell on an NPC. Heals, mind controls, CC's. Sure, many of them can be identified by their cast animation, but not all.
---
Yeah retail is more convenient. Still I‘m downloading many addons like atlas loot and questie to make things easier in classic. Isn‘t this a little bit strange?
---
One of my last UBRS groups had 6 warriors. Most fun I've had in UBRS in a long time. (ALL THE CHARGES ALL THE TIME!)

Get a good nights sleep and eat a shepherd's pie. That and good foreplay, you're back.

(Not the guy you're responding to) I actually remember my very first dungeon run (back during vanilla wow) taking 2 hours. It was black fathom deeps and I was playing a druid. The dungeon was huge and you just have to be ready with spare time for the entire thing.
---
The fact that a hunter is complaining and a paladin/warrior is chill is so accurate. Hunters have it easy, man.
---

I play classic on a mac from 2014 and it runes fine. This game is 14 years old in the end

There’s times you need to kick a mob sure, but generally speaking only trash packs can be kicked, and it’s rare that there’s anything *that* important there

Well what I've made with laptop is that you can go to power settings and change it "do nothing" when lid is closed. That way you can just close the lid.
---
Fair point on the wow token, didn't even consider them separate from the sub, but I guess they are.
---
Me and my buddies do this all the time. You can do it with any animation. We call it “wow dashing.”
---
Yeah I'm actually glad I'm unable to play a shit ton this time around. I'd get sucked right back in.
---
Maybe don't search for trash resources with dozens pages which will have devalved price anyway.

Without knowing their and your resolution how can you assume their card is worse than yours?

If I had a 970 running on 360p, my 600 FPS would put yours to shame.

Reminder to download
---
1) Free transfers off realm to new empty realm(s).
---
2) Reduce realm population cap back to launch level.
---
3) Wait.
---
My guild was single hunter up until a couple days before launch and one of our other hunters came back. Rag died with our third hunter being a trial.  
---
We struggled with hunter and rogue recruitment for awhile which was surprising to us.
---
i have a friend who keeps trying to get me to play retail with them and spends all our time playing classic talking about how xyz is better in retail. I've tried both and there's a lot of reasons i'm still playing classic. conveniently better/logistically better =/= better.
---
People have a hard time discerning the difference between skill and time. I've played with people who think because it takes longer it must be significantly harder. Or they are looking back on how hard it was in 2006 ignoring how the playerbase as a whole improved over the last 15 years.
---
Yeah, that's one of the reasons a lot of people in vanilla would split it up (and the quests / key  / levels kinda try to force that too). Prison or lower city, arena run, emperor run, etc.
---
THunder Clap is very bad aggro ability. Also it could be only used in Balanced stance, so it's used only after first charge one time per pull.  
---
But I don't see any Shield Slams, Sunders or Heroic Strikes. Are you sure warrior was Prot? For me looks like Arms that are trying to be tanking)
---
I did similar outside sm lmao, 1g to talk shit to alliance
---
There's a massive overabundance of the cougars/wolves in badlands. It's about the best bet you can get for being left alone in any contested zone. No one else will really need those mobs.
---
Beautiful
---
Pretty much everyone on my server who advertises portals offers free food/drink with them
---
The same does not apply in games too me.
---
lol tanks pretending they're important. you don't need tanks at all until late in brd
---
I just turned 54 yesterday.
---
On my second character after clearing ony and rag on my first :p
---
Just spend the gold, you'll likely never replace them anyway

I logged in and bought a token on the ah
---
Haha i love this. It's like digital grandpas complaining about everything new.
---
If you want to be social in retail, you just have to be it yourself and the responses are exactly the same as in classic. There are friendly and not that friendly people. The only difference is, you are not that fucked when you don't want to be social in retail wich gives you the opportunity to play solo or just.. quiet. If you do that in classic it will be much harder to do anything.
---
So while i get that classic feels more social in default, i also think that if your retail experience is that unsocial, it's your own fault. Don't bash a game just because you don't know how to talk to people first.
---
Hopefully anyone can follow my bad english. Sry for that.
---
I used to be quite passive when it came to wpvp, sadly razorgore has brought out the worse in me due to being ganked a billion times and even being stabbed in the back by a couple of guys who were happy to exist near me until they realised they had the 2v1 advantage, now i kill any mother fucker that moves regardless of their level, if they attacked me first i'll usually take 10 mins of my time to spawn camp them too.
---
You shouldn't have a problem as a tank finding normal mode dungeons.
---
Yes unless you pull them right back to a very safe place you are going to be in trouble. Then you have mobs who can cc. If they do it to the healer and aren't interrupted, you can wipe easily
---
Fishing these wrechage pools in 40+ zones drop bolt of runecloth and bolt of mageweavecloth. These sell like hot buns. I think fishing in the right spots is 10g/h. I'm not a master angler myself but there are several ways of making decent money with fishing.
---
Expecially compared to other level 40 gold farms.
---
Yeah, as I said, they work differently now. But they are still there, they still a crucial part of Shamans identity. It is not like the changes they made to Survival or the utility spells that they have removed. 
---
Saying that Shaman don't have totems or that they have lost all their unique things is just hyperbolic. Heck, in Classic they don't have the most iconic single Shaman spell in the history of the game. Heroism/Bloodlust which is a TBC addition.
---
I think it's a part of the addon "Auctioneer"
---
Did you just ding 27?
---
I think it's based on your defense skill, which wouldn't have had time to level yet.
---
Just adding on. Improved sap is a talent near the middle of Subtlety, which is a talent tree most pve specs do not touch. And the few that do, do not take this talent.
---
And even with the talents it's a 90% chance to stay in stealth. So once in a blue moon the rogue ends up having to burn vanish to survive.
---
because I can pick up voidwalker perks on the way and it's my favourite spec by far
---
My guild has around 40 active members playing everyday and we only have 2 druids and 2 hunters
---
Ah sorry my friend, you’ve not seen the bloodvine set.
---
Sounds exactly like my schedule. Once the baby is asleep I can play
---
this isn't. it leads to things that are, such as the map just showing you were a quest is supposed to be done at.
---
yeah or just it's ever spawn-camped corpse with 10 people trying to skin it.
---
U rocking an old macbook? Ive got Air from summer 2011 with intel hd3000 and wonder if it could run classic :D usually play on desktop tho
---
Thay I'd be cool with too. There's tons of talent choices I'd like to try out but I know at 50g a pop I'm going to stick with the meta. The one thing I can say about retail is i was never afraid to experiment with my classes choices (as limited as they were in comparison) because I wasn't going to punished by trying out non meta talents.
---
With most classes in classic it really feels like there is only one right way to play each one and even if your okay with not being meta some classes just get locked out of content by not being able to solo out in the world given their spec.
---
Well this problem goes both ways. As a healer I get anoyed at all the tanks standing around, not pulling the next group even tho I am well above 50% mana.
---
Whole point of speed running is efficiency, so no the gold/hr would be different between the two.
---
I absolutely love classic and want it to stick around for a long time, and I don't think our current ostracizing and paternalistic attitude towards the retail players is going to get us there. These posts are on the threshold of getting on r/gatekeeping, but I am also kind of a hypocrite and do dislike the moments when I'm tanking dungeons and dps go balls out without even discussing what their strategy will be, which I certainly can't see a vanilla player doing. Anywho, I do like this post and it reminds of my friend that gave up leveling his rogue for retail because he likes to quest alone but complained about dying all the time. If we can find a way to get more retail players into classic I think it would really good, not just for us, but for the future of both classic and retail because it would show Blizzard we will pay to play a game that is not some spoonfed piece of garbage hamster wheel but something like, as the comic says, "about the journey not the destination".
---
My friend is a warrior tank, and I am a paladin healer , we are leveling together but once in a while we like a dungeon. We just need 3 dps , finding groups yourself as tank is quite easy and I suggest to look 3 dps yourself as u can invite hunters/rogues/locks/ basicly every1 except a mage. 
---
I am playing on Skullflame as Alliance (Rip) but we mostly get asking to play for a cleave group or they are looking for people in /1 /2 chats themself with aoe cleave in the name. We don't have people whispering, asking, inviting to groups.
---
Warrior tanking question about 2-handers:
---
I'm currently leveling a warrior (level 23) and happy to tank any dungeons I run, but the lack of rage at times can be pretty frustrating.  I've seen people mention tanking with a 2-hand as I'm Arms spec, but not sure how to do it successfully...
---
Do I start a pull in Battlestance with charge (when viable), then switch to Prot for the rest of the fight?  When it's just 1 mob I tend to stay in Battlestance and go through my normal DPS rotation.  Thanks in advance!
---
Feelsbad that a horde gets it :o not much different than the undead mount
---
sunders wouldn't pop up as it's just a debuff and not a damaging ability.
---
Dirty humans hoping for that free break out racial I think
---
I was just leveling up your dudes.
---
Get recount or details or any other damage meter and look into your overhealing amounts. If you have a ton of overhealing, you are wasting a ton of mana.
---
Make sure you prioritize heals. Not everyone needs to be at full health all the time. It is fine to let a dps just chill at 50% or higher and let their own spirit regen heal them up if no danger is coming.
---
I would wait until the tank gets around 60%(depending on mobs - enraging mobs with thrash maybe not) and then start your big boy heal.
---
Otherwise, just run ahead of the tank and plop down to drink as soon as you get out of combat and you can get an easy 10-15 seconds of drinking while the group moves up to the next pack and the tank starts engaging - they won't need heals right away, so you can keep drinking.
---
because they have to go work 9-5 in the morning, better rage at someone else
---
Time to setup a CT Profile again
---
Okay. I'm level 60 and I'm still tanking strat this way without any problem. If you can't handle your rôle effectively then just state it at the beggining and I go in more carefully. That's it.
---
Retail isn't about the leveling process, it's all about endgame, so people either spam dungeons while standing in town or buy boosts so they start to play the fun part of the game  
---
Classic is more about the journey to max lvl then the actual endgame (since right now there isnt much to do there atm)
---
Saving for later!
---
Im pretty sure you are wrong
---
Or people could just stop doing it.
---
Just left a group with a stupid aoe mage, and two pally tanks (who were both bad).  After the 20th instances of them pulling till I'm oom, and then pulling right away.
---
You weren't technically limited to 7 skills, but 700 skillpoints. Which made for example fighters able to have a low level of Magery (40ish) to cast Recall spells, etc. 
---
You'd still skill up to 100 in most skills, though. Also later in the game something called Power Scrolls were added that increased the cap from 100 to 105/110/115/120, though this didn't increase the total cap of 700 so at that point you were forced into hybrid builds.

Just keep spell that will heal 50% of your health on bars. Usually on leveling you will never need full heal.
---
Oh awesome! I was going to write an add-on to do this and call it "grudge" but now I don't have to. Random significantly higher level gankers ignoring my friendly waves be warned. One day I'll be powerful too.
---
That is pretty amazing man, well done, you earn a hard mode achievement or something.
---
In vanilla I leveled my hunter to its mid twenties without a pet, I just completely missed the level 10 class quest. On the plus side it made rather good at kiting...
---
Is this on Flamelash?
---
I haven't healed in a long time but the guys who get one or two shot and then complain about dying were some of my favorites. 
---
I also liked it when the dps would go off somehwere and engage while the tank and I are going the right way. They wipe and get mad and all I can do is tell them I follow the tank...
---
As a rogue currently farming for epic mount I approve this.
---
The only thing I dont do is fishing, its just too boring for me, but mining and skinning makes good money for me, farming around 2 hrs a day is around 50-60g normal, sometimes it can go to 80g, its not much but it’s consistent.
---
In 3 days I made around 180g chill farming.
---
Does a lot of you do desk job? I wanna play wow as soon as i get home after work, but after sitting for 8 hours and watching the computer I cannot stand looking at the screen anymore
---
I can tell you're *really* angry over getting ganked 😄 Shoulda rolled on a PvE server lil bud!
---
Surely the first roll isn’t independent because they need to roll the same number first for the odds on rolling the same number twice? So confused? 😅
---
Not my proudest fap
---
The exact point of this post is saying change your task expectations for the purpose of embracing the grind. Embrace the mentality of playing the game, rather than doing the bare minimum to lvl.
---
I couldn’t move the party frame with leatrixplus, I must have missed it?
---
Thats exactly what you should do if you notice it taking charge. Good on you for being able to tell when its too much.
---
Get GANKED!
---
Permaban? Even those who used dungeon layering didnt get permaban.
---
So like an rl flight?
---
Just wondering... are you talking about yourself aswell. Are you aware of yourself and your emotions?
---
Funemployment
---
I spent like a hour looking for Gregory Agmand in the "Deaths in the Family" quest in Tirisfal Glades, because the Agamand Mill area was large and we kept missing each other with the guy because he wanders around.
---
ah was expecting japanese hide and seek. sad face.
---
Just YouTube a few 101 guides, it’s really not that intimidating.
---
lol wrong.....
---
OP mentioned in other comments he just got his whirlwind axe quest which means he's in the level 30 range. That's fairly casual to moderate playtime since release. 
---
I don't think we need to have a discussion about reducing screen time because homie made a comment about doing basic exercise between flights. It's literally a warrior roleplaying joke. Lighten up.
---
Hi mate. What do you mean? Like a one time donation?
---
Vanilla wow is what it is because it's what the majority wanted.  Do people not realize WoW was always intended to be the convenient casual MMO in its inception?
---
Is windserpent still good dps with lightning breath as 25 hunter? My pet is leveling great but i don't know where to go to level my lightning breath past the first levels. What mobs and where do i go to tame them to learn the level 2 and up? Or 3and up?
---
Also i heard lightning breath might not get benefit from plus damage from talents?or just gear? I may be wrong. But as a night elf hunter is wind serpent lightning breath still top dps. Should i switch to cat?
---
I know with windserpent i should avoid it from using bite correct? Just growl and lightning breath are those only two skills to use?
---
Pfft this is some /r/KarmaCourt/ shit right here.
---
Mine was also removed for not being "related to classic"... :thinking:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d7j24c/me_right_now/
---
No man, six sunders. Don’t dps until you see six sunders or you’re kicked.
---
Human females have a pretty nice casting stance.
---
Should i be down ranking entangling roots? I thought the higher levels with more damage are more likely to break but I am honestly not sure that is true. Haven't found anything confirming or denying this.
---
We’re both at 1440p I believe. Though I may have mistook his post for someone else’s this early in the morn.
---
Have the click the cogwheel next to some frame settings, don't remember.
---
WTF... but also, lol that fits so well.
---
mate he's talking about leveling, he says he is not ooming in dungeons
---
I doubt that lol. You sure seem pretty dumb with all your unfounded beliefs.
---
Gonna have to agree with the mage here **if** you're a coordinated group in disc. Aggro doesn't matter which mages popping frost nova and the time to kill is the same for 1 mob as it is with 10 in an aoe farm. Also with proper cc the healer has to heal even less so healer mana isn't an issue.
---
I love how they just finish off the poor guy and walk away:"Our job I done here, boys"
---
You can get all that back in retail at the start of the expansion. Just like Classic. Give it a few months and anyone starting classic new will have very few people to play with.
---
Such a neat picture
---
I'm planning on doing this. I wanna at least try to get to 60, but I'm only 38 right now. Classic WoW is fun, but I wanna do way more with my spare time. I came from the Pservers and played vanilla, I've played enough WoW for a lifetime. I definitely wanna be playing something else by the New Year at the very least.
---
I'm a rogue and I give water to my healer during runs.
---
It was one of those late night youtube adventures. Reward was Little Big.
---
I feel you man!
---
my frostbolt is doing 12 more DAMAGE DUDE
---
Was looking for this!
---
The 30's are *by far* the worst level range. The dungeons are awful save for SM, your damage is pitiful compared to what you did in the 20's and what you'll do in the 40's, the zones are terrible and scattered all over. Everything about the 30's suck, in my opinion.
---
Princess seems to behave different then on pserver. You could solo her as an ele shaman with LB.
---
Tinkerer was Same.
---
Rotgrip might be kitable with Waterwalk
---
Reading through these makes me feel like I tip way too much. At the beginning of a session I'll throw a mage 2-3g for 6-8 stacks of level appropriate water. Time is money, friends
---
It's because of the mace + sword spec for humans (they get +5 to those weapon skills) being so strong for rogues and warriors.
---
Except its not personal opinion. Any form of intoxicating reduces performance. Thats just simple fact.
---
Yeah ill think of that when i cant pay my bills!
---
Menethil boat videos and fake rp letters.
---
So what you do is, level to 50 and buy your mount then.  That's what my broke ass had to do, because I couldn't afford a mount till that level.
---
this is accurate enough that i hate im a mage.
---
i sware guys, i didnt pick it because its op and i sure as hell havnt wiped any groups...ok maybe like 2.
---
(to be fair though, if the things ur pullin are mostly non elites like the bugs in ZF. its actually fine if the mage does it, as any mage braindead or not can aoe some non elites. its only if your pullin elites that it becomes a problem and even then the mage shouldnt be aoe spamming unless the group is built for cleave)  
---
my complaint is for the warlocks that dot everything randomly, like a warriors pulling 3 mobs. i go to poly one that heals and .5 seconds later its got a dot on it. and this happens every single time. STAP IT WARLOCKS STAP IT D:
---
Hmm I have put some people on ignore after a dungeon where I thought they were being asses. They would probably disagree. Not saying it applies to you, but generally people view themselves positively.
---
Razorgore?
---
Being ignored is barely being a victim, and as to being sensitive, I dont really care about the ignores individually. The servers are so big they dont matter really. 
---
The point I tried to make was that I played wow so much back in the day and never  got ignored once in years. Now its been 3 times in 3 weeks...
---
Two days ago i (51 warrior) somehow run into the devilsaur's corpse. 
---
Unskinned. 
---
These were easy money.
---
True! my bad :)
---
My hobby is playing wow outdoors with friends
---
Haven’t tried it in raids or cities. Don’t tend to check it because I lock it at 144. Last I checked was in Tanaris. Willing to bet it gets quite a lot lower in cities.
---
I never understood why jaina went ragemade after theramore got bombed, but now i do, i’ll slaughter every horde i see on noggenfogger.
---
Good picture motif.
---
Indeed, tanking is rough 1.13 has so many damage upgrades for classes everyone does much more damage than 1.1 for example. Plus 15 years of knowledge.
---
It might be worth putting auto-shoot in a macro with "/assist &lt;tankname&gt; in the beginning. Modify the macro at the start of a dungeon, and swap for normal auto-shoot when not in dungeons.
---
Over a 3 minute fight, you cast 70 or so Frostbolts. That's 840 extra damage. It adds up.
---
No it increases the max view distance you can zoom away. It doesn't automatically do it
---
IDK different strokes for different folks. There's tons of people in the world that think its weird as fuck that we enjoy messing around in a virtual world with no real meaning.   
---
We all enjoy different shit and that's ay okay.
---
This is a mage hate thread, please take your stories of mages playing well to the mage love thread, if you can find one. Lol
---
Wow's peak also correlates to the mainstreaming of MOBAs.  MOBAs had far more to do with Wow's decline than anything blizzard did.
---
I used to moan about flight paths and how long it takes to get from one end of a map to another, now I use them as a break to do stuff that needs to do be done around the house.
---
we usually pull the entire hallway to interrogator and aoe down the boss with the mobs. Def doable, just maybe not through pugs
---
I actually can't think of a single pull in brd that can't be aoe down
---
Because unless the mages are brain dead and if the group is coordinated, it is understandably faster. If you asked anyone if they want  40k exp in an hour or 60k what would you say? Shit takes awhile in classic and thats part of the charm but why do so many people on this sub act shocked some people want to be more efficient?
---
with me?
---
twich has nearly every addon, but there search feature or the charts dont work well,
---
most of the time when you add a addon the client will notice it and finds is
---
LEL DRUIDS MEME SPEC.........sorry man fuck that shit, people suck. Druids for life!!!!
---
That is because you are behind the pack or on par. All the good mages are 60's. I had to close myself in to a maraudon and aoe farm there solo, because i running zf was pure pain. Any good mage that want to aoe farm is specced frost, imp bliz min 2/3. I do 3/3 for the safety. 
---
So imp blizz is a must for soloing if you want to aoe farm, which is a thing that any good mage ll do. If ppl do pick ST talents then they should not join aoe groups, but there is no way to check.
---
Hello hillsbrad:)
---
Astounded by how good this guy was. The fact it landed him a job at blizz is even better!
---
It's the natural way of things and was an incredibly fruitful move to knockout gold farmers and increase revenue.
---
My main on Vanilla was a hunter and I never had any problems from other people.  Maybe I got a pass cos I was always with my warrior friend.
---
I have a very strict set of criteria for whether or not I will kill an Alliance player:
---
 - If you are a rogue, you die.
---
 - If I /wave and you don't /wave back, you die.
---
 - If your name is something particularly stupid, you die.
---
 - If you are fighting a Horde player, I will help them kill you.
---
 - If you are skinning a corpse, I will cast Psychic Scream, skin the corpse myself, and leave without further interaction unless you damage me.
---
Well Blizz recently launched an official Brazil realm, so hopefully most of the Portuguese speakers will go there. Of course that might mean Thalnos ends up pretty dead. Re-rolling may be your best bet.
---
Ok. Well played sir, Well played.
---
Yeah it's funny cause that kid got mad and people are loving him because he's Alliance. Na, it's funny though, he think he's getting to me and he won't. I actually played Alliance when I first started but I just prefer the Horde so much more.
---
yes, there is 2 kinds, rage potion and giant rage potions
---
Where did you grind like this?
---
Either learn Portuguese, or reroll on another server.
---
Lol stop telling ppl how to live their lives when you literally live through twitch streamers weirdo
---
How do I see hours played?
---
It's a bit puzzling that you would tell someone to fuck off for being too sensitive yet also quit a game you presumably enjoy playing over a 24-48 hour ban.
---
When did I say I can't read his messages?
---
Gnomes can't solo Mara princess.
---
When I tried to kite around the pillar, I will get into swimming state, thus slowing my movement speed, thus  cannot solo princess. Is there anyway around this problem?
---
The main strenght of affli is Dark Pact. I wouldn't recommend investing points in other trees before getting it. And after that i wouldn't recommend to disable all pet skills to save mana. 
---
Atm i'm still using VW most of the time since there's a lot of pvp and sacrifice allows me to 1v1 almost anyone (only have problems with well geared war that have the initiation). Since i don't enable its threat generator it just hit like a wet noodle and doesn't generate threat but i only use it as a mana reservoir. And i use the aoe taunt on occasion.
---
Void can hold aggro if DoT'ing more minimally. I find if you Immolate you dont get the most out of CoA anyway.
---
&gt; I have no problems with how feign works when it works
---
This got me wondering, have you ever tried playing with actually working FD? The delay is unbearable, I've had a lot of people simple just walk away when they notice me FD. Even if I'm literally on top of them there is plenty of time for them, since everyone is already on guard for a trap when they are in melee with a hunter.
---
Not trying to be a doomsayer, I'm just really curious how you feel about the delay, since I find that to be a bigger problem than how it doesn't always work. As you say, there are workarounds to make the succes rate kind of okay, but there is no helping for the delay.
---
This thread touches my heart, honestly now.
---
It's not like I can't handle a 3mage group, I have been accepting the first people that threw whispers at me whenever I form my own groups anyway.
---
It's not like that aoe isn't faster, because it totally is.
---
But after 2-3 runs like this, I want to log out and take a break. I feel exhausted from playing in the edge and hitting my buttons as fast as I can in a mundane attempt of building rage.
---
In short, it's not fun for me. A deep prot build is not meant for this.
---
Every single time I take the time to mark and single target kill, the groups go so damn smooth, that honestly the time difference between aoe groups and normal ones makes me not wanting to join the first ones anymore.
---
So, yeah, feel free to aoe as much as you like, but from now on, if you do, I will remove you from my groups. What was that? You didn't like that? Easy, don't join when I form them. 
---
I will take the time to note from now on in LFG something like...
---
"Single target group for ST, need heals and 3dps, go"
---
I'm guessing those same priests didn't tell you right off the bat that they'd never healed a dungeon before?
---
My solution is to line of sight the guys ontop of the roof, be quick and smart about vendoring, quest turn-ins and accepting new. There are enough ways of countering this. Also the graveyard is literly next to the city.
---
I've always seen these city's like the camp in STV. City's with both horde and alliance in them should have some fun pvp interactions without always being shut down by guards. 
---
Because there are enough ways of countering and the penalty for dying is nothing with the graveyard this close, I see this as part of the sandbox experience. But I guess thats an unpoppulair oppinion. Still... #nochanges . Just report people if you dont like it.
---
Adding a few more reasons...
---
1.12 was a much easier game than 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc for many reasons.
---
There were not guides before content was even released.
---
Things were buggy in game back then.
---
Communication software was not as reliable.
---
Awesome list
---
Had the exact same experience.
---
It feels hella good though stopping someone ganking someone else!
---
&gt; What mobs and where do i go to tame them
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#lightningbreath
---
I wonder if enable to rotate the minimap would make it easier... Gotta try this one!
---
I had the same problem at your level so I can feel your pain. 
---
At first i skilled way down affli but was so annoyed that the vw is always loosing aggro.
---
So I went full demo. It worked quite well but was very very boring, and at the end I still got aggro at some point, even with improved vw.
---
So I decided to go drain tank at 40 (I think it doesn't make sense with your level) and boy i had a blast. Drain tank with succ is sooo much more fun than vw, dots, wand wand wand wand.....
---
Its just sooo much more fun if you doesn't have to care about aggro.
---
But it could be a bit harder if you play on a pvp server because you are missing sacrifice.
---
I would recommend you to level to 38, start to get your shadowweave set and go drain tank.
---
You’ll be happy you rolled mage when you get your teleport and portals
---
Damn that’s unfortunate for you. I should say I have a gb g1 so it’s been binned and tidily overclocked.

Ehn, no. Classic is far from casual. It's easy, sure. But casual? Nah.
---
No casual player is going to spend the hours required to get to 60 in classic. You just don't get there without a serious commitment of time, especially if you're not following a highly optimized route.
---
And by the time you make serious commitments to a game? You're no longer casual. You might not be hardcore, but classic lacks all the concessions towards casual gamers that WoW has made over the years.
---
Hey guys! Since it seems that my first comment gets buried I wanna let you all know by my current Patreon goal of creating a comic book Based on WoW Classic. Here is a broad, general description:
---
Set within the World of Warcraft universe, we'll join two groups of characters as they embark in a journey filled with hardship, strife and unexpected lessons.
---
One group start their journey in the harsh, rugged land of Durotar, home to the newly settled orcs of Draenor and the native Darkspear trolls. However, the winds are changing, and they utter words of dark, wicked forces gathering within the great Horde's home, Orgrimmar.
---
The other group are brought together in the seemingly peaceful Elwynn Forest which shelters the mighty capital Stormwind City. But all is not well in the shining jewel of the Alliance as rumors have it that the king, Varian Wrynn, has gone missing.
---
Though worlds apart, both of these parties will realize that old wounds never heal.
---
They will learn that it is in time of peace that you must prepare for war.
---
If you'd like to see this goal reached, take a look.
---
Thank you for the crazy reception and love to you all,
---
Vlad
---
Can you add pickpocket to the start of this?
---
Frost Shock would like to have a word with you
---
People don't realize how big of a difference 1.12 itemization makes. They think that they are better players now but I have seen the most retarded shit in mc pugs that still manage to kill ragnaros.
---
I feel like this is the current meta for a lot of players
---
This and Questie (or similar quest helper) not being in the game by default was a big "Whoa I guess it was like that huh?" for me as well.
---
I couldn't agree with you more.  I plan my day the night before and allot a time frame for a good session of WoW and then I actually follow the plan I set.  Literally everything gets done if you schedule it and execute.  You actually end up having WAY more free time and, because your plan is now to play WoW, the time you spend playing is completely guiltless.  I'm married, work full time, go to the gym 3x/week, and play 1-2 hours of WoW per day if not more!
---
Wear your Ghostspeak Amulet, ya ding dong
---
Learning Portuguese to play wow classic would be a badass move
---
Hope this Gild gets bigger than olympus
---
&gt;So yeah it does kind of suck, but I guess that's part of the charm.
---
Classic mechanics in a nutshell.
---
It is pretty bad. I've been in a lot of questing groups where half the group quits/takes a break because of constant ganks. Today I logged into searing gorge and horde had taken over the entire zone. I have no idea what was going on, but Thorium point was filled with bodies, a lot of questing areas were full of bodies. Legit had 10 alliance jumping around Thorium point in the spirit realm waiting for it to pass.
---
Funny thing is, the server moves are making it significantly worse. Most of the people who are moving are alliance. When the data was up to date on the census addon, we were losing like 4,000 alliance players a week. I've been tempted to move, but I've also seen enough players talk about it being more difficult to find groups to sway me away from it. At least for now. Again when the census data worked, we had about double the players overall. And about 10x as many level 60s. 
---
I'm just waiting for phase 2 because I am 99% sure that something along this line will happen
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/GfPuAsg.png](https://i.imgur.com/GfPuAsg.png) 
---
Then phase 3 will release and servers wont matter anymore except for PvE
---
How so? Attack speed 1.0. A casters worse nightmare.
---
Maybe its because there are more mages than hunters.
---
The Portstones will be unlocked in phase 2 when my mind didn’t lie to me.
---
Chicks are hot, dicks are hot, whats not to get?
---
So instead of just continue to quest and get the mount at 43ish and getting to probably lvl 50 during the weekend, you spent all of it to make as much as you would have made from questing but only got to lvl 40. 
---
I get it, mount at 40. Very important milestone. But your method of taking time away from leveling to generate gold is incredibly inefficient, both goldwise and obviously xp wise. 
---
Keep that in mind everyone. 
---
Disregard this if you'd rather have a mount at 40 regardless of inefficiency and in my opinion, fun.
---
Dreadmist? I cant recognize names in /1 tho. Join /4 if u dont mind, u will need it.
---
In current meta the best classic tanks are (surprisingly) paladins anyway.
---
Thats why i dont care much about aggro and use 2h weapon all the time except the hard bosses. Aggro doesnt matter much since trash dies fast, so i just add solid dps on top of others.
---
Thats what I was thinking, this looks really good.
---
Get out of elemental asap and into enhance.
---
Fixed, thanks!
---
I totally agree with you and I play a mage.  I just want normal runs.  I'm not a zoomer.  I'm not on a JD Wentworth commerical where it's my exp and I need it now.  I want a smooth run that doesn't result in multiple deaths.  When your group wipes, you lose that time you would have otherwise been saving and the xp/hr doesn't pan out.
---
My SM groups were mostly horrific with the exception of one spellcleave group we had for cathedral.  I think I entered Lib 7 or 8 times and only killed the final boss two times.  Most of the groups were let's just pull and aoe everything cause its so much xp.  In reality the xp for a dungeon is already set.  How fast you get that xp is only thing the players can control.  Pulling to the last hallway in Lib and then dying two times, allows for all the wings to respawn meaning you have to clear everything again.  People start to leave. New people join.  Then someone wants to reset.  I just want to finish the last boss.
---
You used to be able to do it with belfs and they would do a full 180 above the waist, breaking their spine
---
As a side note, the nights are better in Classic.
---
there were some guys camping stanley a while ago and would tag him as he transforms. now i get why. assholes
---
Thank you. But i already tried and gave up. Still searching for another pala but its not the same.
---
[Cool](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/classic-eu/Nethergarde-Keep/Ggallin) .
---
I want this for my hunter!!!
---
Get an AH addon such as Auctionator, use it to do full AH scans regularly. If the item turns up its price will be recorded, which can give you a rough idea - remember though, just because an item has been up for a certain price 1-3 times does not mean that it was actually sold, nor does it mean that the price wasn't too cheap. Ballpark idea only.
---
I seem to recall that PCBS is the pre-raid BiS gun, however, so you might want to stick to your guns (heh!) for some time and mull things over until the economy improves. I'm not a hunter player though, so take it with a pinch of salt. Grats to your epic, hope for some good income there!
---
I'm on the same server and have a realm transfer available. Maybe you have one too and didnt notice?
---
Kittycleave group lul
---
Doing zf with friends and laughing so hard i farted then laughed harder because i farted then peed a little
---
i did the wetlands dwarves in the north of the zone, the arathi elites in the south west castle, the alterac ogres in the north of the zone, and the ogres south of the zul gurub entrance in STV
---
It's almost as if he said "it only takes a couple minutes to run the length of Duskwood.", and not "it only takes a couple minutes to do millions of walks between the cemetery and town."
---
it’s totally preference but imp void walker is not used for improving tanking as u will hardly notice any difference. You wanna use demo talents for the pvp while leveling. Fel Domination + 2/2 Master Summoner and then keep adding points on the Affliction tree , or that’s what i’m doing at least. It sucks not being to fight off enemies if they jump on you while questing but with this build they will be regretting it most of the times.
---
Yeah it worked out, the only way to do it really
---
I read that the sunken temple class quests wont be around until phase 3(?) might have been 2, but iirc it was 3
---
This is EU on Gehennas where majority of the players are swedish and probably this person aswell which means money won't run out. Welfare money!
---
Don’t have a problem with it on my R shaman. The nighttfin food buff is actually the same icon as manaspring, not your typical Cheese icon. Can get a little confusing
---
Definitely Windseeker. I see this guild name at least daily.
---
Warriors have been completely changed for the worse in retail. Fury lost single minded fury and the ability to single 2h. We lost stances. The list goes on and on. Those are all huge changes.
---
People communicating in retail? HAH!
---
LoS.
---
Yeah my friend and I have been having to reread our quests and trying to figure out where to go for quests. It's a little annoying at times but it's kinda cool and old school.
---
it's really not, I did SFK on my priest at level 21, my last heal rank upgrade was getting the normal "Heal Rank 1" at level 16, SFK mobs are level 24-25 near the end and arugal is level 26
---
Yes, walk around the water.
---
Oh really? I've seen mages selling food/drink on mine
---
I’m proud of your achievement!
---
I left Gehennas after first week at level 33 and joined My friends at Dreadmist (53lvl atm). It was a great decision. This game is so much fun with players who you enjoy playing with. Go for it!
---
I am still waiting for that banwave
---
I should take some of the things I learned from this post and make it into a poison reaplication macro. Which could get quite cumbersome with all the different poisons around.
---
I’m just pointing out the fact that people have banter in Classic. I have been told by other retail players that you can socialise in retail as well it’s just a bit harder. People aren’t as friendly/talkative. 
---
Well that’s the thing about classic, people just talk shit in global chat. (By talking shit I’m referring to banter). They are not forced to but they still do, to entertain themselves and each other. That’s what gives a friendly vibe to the game. 
---
The fact that you can ask any question in chat and you will get your response but you will also get some funny comments. 
---
That sense of community is what makes Classic fun for me. It’s not the game itself.
---
I remember classic well enough to know sheep, trap, pull was how you survived instances. This meta is bullshit and I too as a tank am done with it.
---
Type /played
---
How realistic is this to do though, and how much longer do you reckon it will take than regular questing mixed in with some dungeon runs for quests? Non-mage non-speed runner style.
---
It's an investment, you won't replace them for a long time.
---
"We want classic, the real WoW!! Also here's a list of QoL features"
---
Blizzard never provide accurate values.
---
So what? It's a level 20 dungeon. You don't even need a tank. I tanked ZF on my rogue because our tank left and we couldn't find a tank. We ran with 2 rogues, mage, warlock, and priest. It went just fine. Nothing worse than a healer that can't get over themselves and thinks it's their job to punish people for not playing the game in the proper way.
---
I really tried to play Classic WoW without using any addons, but the default auction UI is just unbearable. Had to install Auctionator.
---
Joke’s on you, see my flair? I never get invited in the first place!
---
Where the hell did you make it up that I am upset??
---
Where do you see the available realm transfer? In the event I can't transfer, is there any solid Horde Guilds anyone could recommend?
---
Partially to do with leveling speed/ease and partially to do with newer players gravitating to the class because it was seen as easier to play due to pet tanking I think.
---
Hydra is good, check his priest videos
---
This one is about downrank
---
https://youtu.be/6q92MsxWTCg
---
Dwarfs are the tastiest they are extra thicc
---
The meeting stones were never port stones in Vanilla if I recall, they were an early version of "Looking for group tool".  
---
You could check for groups for X or Y dungeon from the meeting stone or an innkeeper.
---
Warrior went down first? Checks out. I spent a lot of time taking soil samples in MC as the OT.
---
We should put a thread with useful macros like this at the top of the front page.
---
Imp vw is worth picking up for sure. With it, vw can comfortably hold aggro with 3 dots up, just don't use immo. My general approach is dot/vw one mob and drain tank another. If you have the mana, you can also dot/fear a third as well.
---
Actually yes
---
I was at 500g yesterday then i bought devilsaur set :) back to being a poor bitch, currently saving gold for epic mount and Lionheart helm
---
How did you transfer realms now? There was an option for a few days upon release to handle the full up servers but since it has disappeared for me.
---
I am not an native speaker, I am not accustomed to this use.  
---
Thanks.  
---
"They were just doing their job, no need to insist. When they realized that you where the reporting player they just went on with their job" Would be good?  
---
It feel strange to me, because it seems to me that I am speaking about more people, which is not true.
---
Just do green-yellow one.
---
Petopia.com has all ur answers
---
yes. while browsing wow addons in the right top corner the is a drop down box with retail and clasic. switch to classic
---
This. It seems like some people just have poor time management or self discipline. I work full time, get home and cook dinner, clean up and then spend an hour or three on WoW and Discord with my friends. 
---
If anything, my social life has improved because I talk more regularly with some online/distant friends now. You don't have to let a game take over your life.
---
It's been posted so many times I'm starting to think these are actually advertisements for it.
---
Snurk got those DSL
---
Thanks for all the help! I don’t wanna waste the gold yet on going drain tank, but once I’m at a level we’re its effective I’ll make the switch. Because going down demo was going to be my next choice for leveling but I was worried imp vw wasn’t going to change much. I seem to always pull aggro as a lock no matter what I’m grouped with unless it’s a port warrior.
---
\*cackles in actually having an epic mount\*
---
FYI the stones in front of dungeons will tell you its minimum level; tanks need to be a couple levels higher and healers can be one or two lower.  Everyone with weapons needs to have at least a near-on-level weapon skill for what they're wielding so that they get parried less.  Elixirs and potions are relatively cheap and help a ton; it's common courtesy to bring relevant elixirs for one's role assuming one isn't overleveled.
---
There's a channel specifically called LookingForGroup - type /join lookingforgroup to join and chat in it.
---
I thought I recalled something like that.
---
I wonder why that isn't in classic then?
---
I'm curious, is your continual shit posting and criticism of others helping you out in any way?
---
4 days played is 96 hours, so more than 3 hours a day since launch. If you work thats allready a big chunk of your free time, even more so if you have any other obligations.
---
So you mean it went from 1 to 3 because retail sucks and classic rules? Nice!
---
Yeah poor mages have no income at all.
---
Goddamnit, Comedy Central... The standup comedy spiel has already been done thousands of times
---
Ah yes, I too wish to "running man" all over King Terenas's death site.
---
Character selection screen. Bottom left click on shop
---
So your just going down demo for imp vw. And your selecting the aff talent that stops you from being interrupted when you drain life?
---
Red = Dead
---
Nice guide....  
---
and can i just say i love it when people make builds like this :) 
---
so far in classic i have seen Fury tanks and melee warlocks which both sounds like fun
---
Okay I can try this thanks to your hard work. Now I have a game question. Do u think this is safe to do with warrior? By safe I mean u dont want to make a lot of graveyard runs.
---
Welcome to the hunter life, bitch please
---
I need to know aswell! :-)
---
I cant find elvui for wow classic where did you download it
---
I got stomped by a devilsaur for the first time in Un'Goro last night and it made me laugh my ass off. Caught me completely off guard and it was already touch and go on if I was going to live. I fucking love this game.
---
Yeah I know but as a druid, macro space is precious and used for more important tasks.  
---
I made a slight modification to the add on on my local machine so that I can now have a keybind for the toggle :)
---
And people who think battle shout spam is enough to take aggro back need to find a new threat meter.
---
Nah it's an old Lenovo I bought second hand over three years ago
---
Well, they gave a warning to the guy that REPORTED other guys doing it. "Because he was there".
---
On a pvp server, easiest way imo is to try play the AH. I sold a 1g vendor item from a high level zone on the AH early hours this morning that net me 40g alone. That took my total at level 31 to 60g but I've spend 20 of that now buying up some cheap patterns and materials which I can flip for more.
---
If I need to grind anymore than that, I'll likely kill gorilla's in STV for the hair and skins and vendor it all. As a rogue you can get away without buying a lot of skills so that's saved me a fair amount of coin so far
---
No it's independent because that outcome doesn't affect and isn't affected by the second roll. 1/100 to roll the same number, and then the same odds to roll the same number a second time, but doing it both times is multiplicative. (1/100)^2
---
Can some pls make "Chatscanner" work in classic? A brilliant addon that allows you to enter keywords into it, once the word is mentioned in chat, you will get an alert! 
---
"SM LIB"
---
"ARMORY"
---
"GY"
---
@colossal-FairbanksUS
---
Until i get home
---
Yes! Thanks for the addon I'ma download it after work. KOS list here we come
---
It also very much depends on the toon.  Solo Shamans and Warriors have it rough until about 40+ and/or they get good items.  Hunters and Druids can breeze through content.  If you're doing professions or frequently selling items to players/working the AH that's another time sink.
---
i didn´t want to blame anyone or be disrespectful. sry if it sounded like. it just reminds me of the things grandpas say about.. well, anything new.   
---
if you don´t try to be part of something but complain about it to people that have the same mentality than you, that´s what old people do with music, clothing, etc.   
---
If you really play retail seriously, and i don´t think of competitive or Progress players, but players who want to play the game and enjoy it, it´s just nothing like the complaints are all the time. if i want to talk to people, i just.. talk to people. no mythic needed. it´s still a MMORPG but you CAN play it solo if you want. i can see nothing bad in that. if you want to play it with an active and talkative guild, look for one and join it. if you want a nice group to go through dungeons, even to level, just write it in global chat or look for a organized group. Just because you can use the tools that make the game "less social" doesn´t mean you have to.   
---
Also i don´t want to talk bad about classic. i enjoy playing classic. i don´t tell people that classic is bad, thats not what i think. but everyone says retail is bad because it´s not like classic, but that´s not an argument for me. mosdt of the issues people are talking about when looking at retail are just self made in my eyes.
---
Yes? I also enjoy the game. But wheres the difference pulling 3 or 5 mobs concerning the fun factor?
---
Ele shaman power
---
I think people toon the "camt handle it" as a bad thing or me demeaning retail players, i cant handle build stuff for hours on minecraft that just means that that game iant for me, theres nothing wrong about it, go back to retail not as an insult but as actual advise, if you enjoy other aspect of the game go enjoy that and leave classic for the rest.
---
Barrens, i miss you allready.
---
Its not darnassus rep. In Winterspring there is a rep dedicated to these sabers.
---
&gt;Diminishing someone's gaming choices because they have less time to play
---
Not going diminish anyones choices, but classic is better for people with less time to play. I don't get why everyone thinks it's the other way around.
---
Let's say you can only play nothing or 30min a day, 2 hours a day during weekends. When you log into retail, you literally will not get anything meaningfull done. You are going to "have" to do dailies, which you will never finish, and need to start all over again the next day, just so you can attempt to somewhat keep up. In classic, you just pick up where you left do what you want. You'll probably never get to touch dungeons or raid content, but with your playtime you will still have things to do and goals to accomplish 1 year down the road. If we assume 6 hour per week, so 1 weekday out of the week on average they do not play at all, 10 days /played means it will literally take 40 weeks before they're max leveled, and then they have professions, rep, gold and other things they could work towards.
---
It's not that I don't understand why people prefer retail, I really do understand it. I just really disagree with this one specific thing, because between world quests, daily heroics, weekly mythic+ etc, I feel like it's very unfriendly to people with a daily playtime under a certain threshold, much unlike classic.
---
Which is fine? They'll get xp from doing dungeons while getting their gear.
---
It has no use for healing. Im full feral. And for pvp this goes great when i jumo into bear vs melee classes
---
I'm a level 50 mage and I do these farm groups once in a while, I also clear a dungeon fully at least one time for the quests, and I mainly quest to level up, that doesn't mean that I or anyone else that likes to do these farm groups are noobs just because they are not 60 yet.
---
Where did you farm the essences 😩😩😩
---
I like the commitment. I remember fondly the feeling of trying to achieve something in vanilla, making a plan and no-life it. 
---
Some om my best experiences in gaming to date. Grats!
---
The issue is that you haven't bought the 999$ mac stand.
---
It's okay, but finding pugs will be extremely hard, many tanks wont bring another warrior to share loot with.
---
because bad posture
---
I figured since imp vw improved all the taunt spells by 30% I think it would help manage more aggro.
---
4g an hour isn't awful, though, depending on your level
---
I grinded for 4-5g/hour lvl 37-40 for my mount. Course, I was also getting exp while I was doing that, but still
---
You'd still need 2 other people to be there though.. 2 people get ported at most. Buts it helps for sure.
---
Hydramist got good videos about that. https://youtu.be/OEQNWLFNmys 
---
 You don't have to watch it the video, just listen if watching takes to much time.
---
He explains it perfectly.
---
He's a priest in APES, and knows what he's talking about
---
uncut
---
The time doesn’t stop but it’s like a few hours at most isn’t it ?
---
Nobody said that those mages are good Players. I knew that they were bad playes otherwise they wouldn't pull so much and blame it on the tank when the Group wipes.
---
I'm totally fine with mage's AOE'ing things as Long as they let me pull and give me at least on thunder on the target/s before they start melting them with Nova/CoC - Blizzard
---
So you call bullshit on the single target run taking 8 mins longer. But it taking 10mins longer sounds good to you. I think with such a small gap both is very possible if you have a good Group.
---
IDC tbh. There is good mages, bad mages just like any other class there is good and bad People.
---
What I don't get is why you have the Need to defend yourself on reddit? Do you think the Reputation of mages has taken such a big hit that you Need to justify yourself?
---
Also - of course AOE grinding dungeons is faster otherwise you guys wouldn't do it right?
---
I generally just don't get the Point of this post sorry m8. 
---
Still a good read :)
---
It was only a minority that wanted OSRS. The servers were barren at first. Then it got updated and got increasingly popular. But RS3 was much more popular for a long time.
---
As a NE Hunter, you had the full opportunity to get an owl:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/4645yc/psa_for_hunters_pet_decision_aka_get_a_fucking_owl/
---
Owls are great for leveling. I’m a 43 Hunter and only recently switched to BT, but kept my owl because of the screech and overall DPS and tanky-ness of it.
---
Sup with the retail Jaina model? She's still a pure blonde in Classic.
---
Hell yes! I was talking about this glitch to a friend. Glad it’s still there!
---
For leveling STR is better. Until you reach 60 and get decent gear, your crit chance would be ~15%, so it won't matter in short fights.  
---
Same reason why it's pointless taking talent that give you 2 combo points per crit.  
---
At level 60 (so when you can't kill mob in ~5 seconds) agi is better because crits will finally start to shine.  
---
So for leveling - STR, 60+ - agi.  
---
In PvP you want agi, because more combo points - faster you could finish with Bite or Rip.
---
I started to solo them at 54, and I feel like there were fewer than 5 instances where I didn't have full cds for them. People are after them all day. 
---
I made my two pieces by level 56 and I was nowhere near pre raid bis. All I had was the ring from mara. That being said, if you want to solo them that early on rogue, you'll need stacks of health pots.
---
Yeah I gave it a shot too, and it's definitely doable, really depends on if you can pool rage/there are enough mobs to hit you/you don't miss-parry-block-dodge your hit but with at least one of those you should be able to do it.
---
Though I did notice that spells like WW even if they're not on 'the' GCD, they seem to share a gcd with other spells, such as mortal strike and other spells (though I wasn't very thorough to see which ones they were, apart from MS, just saw the animation on my bars)
---
I found it usefull for pulls where you have 2-4 big mobs and lots of low life adds because you can easily pull off the rotation and get rage easily, making you quickly build your threat on the big ones while the little adds get AoE nuked faster than they can move on a DPS
---
Though I did find it to fall off quickly when &gt; to 4 big mobs, because of our spell hit caps, and the rotation locking us in a 5s cycle for a 4 target AoE spam, meaning any excess mobs might be rushing away, 5 is manageable through a taunt, and 6 can be pulled off with a good skull+concussion blow but you need to be quite deep in prot already so you'll usually be unable to do it While tanking in leveling phase as arms/fury
---
I'm sorry you are so narrow-minded and stuck in protocol :).
---
Honestly just reroll, it's better to take the time now then deal with it for the rest of the time.
---
IMO (obviously) World pvp is absolutely pointless, most of the time it's not interesting or fair, its just ganking, yea sure there's come cool clips out there, but that's literally the exception to what world pvp is. Add some fucking stakes to dying besides making other players lose time, and it might get less shitty.
---
I had a 40 warrior and rerolled on a PvE server much like you, I had friends who rolled on a PvP server then backed off to a PvE server so I followed.
---
Could add a /yell to the macro so every time you got to cancel, you may get lucky and educate the priest with some snappy dialogue.
---
Atleast close the door
---
But your a warrior Harry!
---
Watch stay safe guide lol
---
You have complete control over it and it acts as your character. If anything I could run through mobs without pulling them pretty frequently which was annoying when you're literally trying to pull as much as possible. Spell cleave only works when the first mage knows what to do, you need some blizzards already rolling as the mobs arrive, and make sure to nova the melee with the spell casters as the casters make it into LoS of the group otherwise you have two different mob groups and it's a shitshow.
---
Ok so i started yesteday, it was my first day in Wow classic and im really surprised how relaxing this game is, however I have a ton of questions :)
---
1. I picked warrior orc (I don't even feel this slow leveling, maybe because this is my first time wow and i dont have comparison, I really enjoy it). Played 2 hours yesterday got level 8.
---
2. What items from monsters i should keep and which should i sell ?
---
3. I took first aid to make bandages.
---
4. Should i go for arms skills like hamistring or wait and invest in fury skills? I checked a lot of tutorials but there isnt clear information about how to progress in early levels.
---
5. Will i be able to respec skills ? how much it will cost ?
---
6. Can you kite with hamistring ? Some people say that kiting this way is bugged.
---
7. How can i craft items ?
---
8. What profession should i take as warrior ? Blacksmithing ?
---
9. Is there any list of quests somwhere or detailed guide what skills to do ? Some people say some quests are a waste of time etc.
---
Thanks !
---
wow
---
Seriously the best mount in the game, i almost rolled alliance because of it.
---
Are we going to be able to fight nax again?
---
This is the correct answer. Also acceptable is "Africa" by Toto.
---
I wouldn't call the epic mount free mate, that thing could end up being more expensive than a normal epic mount. Best start buying mats for it now.
---
I think it will be Classic into BC into WotLK. And then it gets interesting.
---
Iam a mage and i adapt for what ever the group/majority wants to play because i like peace and fun.
---
you cant just go to their zones and quest to earn rep?
---
When you join and there is a queue the "free migration" option is granted. But it's most likely possible to do this when there is no queue as well.
---
The Forsaken are basically the Scourge except that they use the rest of the horde as a meat shield.
---
Frostbolt only gets 0.81 of every spellpower if im not mistaken.
---
Fireball gets the full value.
---
Cool, thanks for the heads up buddy
---
I don't understand anything. What glitch? I see nothing except it seems like you're an orc in stornwind, but I haven't been to stornwind in 11-12 years or so don't remember how it looks
---
There's tricks you need to know to keep up AoE threat as a warrior. Your experience will probably be completely different with a paladin or druid tank(or a good warrior).
---
Of course but for some people it’s way out of hand. You don’t watch tv or go for long walks for 9 hours in your spare time and if you do its not something you do everyday.
---
Everything should be taken in moderation.
---
Yes, it did.
---
&gt; If you are a rogue, you die.
---
At which point I will follow you around and make your life hell.
---
Hey, you assume I’m an asshole rogue and gank me and I’m gonna at least live up to it.
---
Totally agree however if you have kids that planning kicks you in the face multiple times a day :)
---
I hope they go TBC route. I like vanilla but I think TBC was the better game.
---
hell yeah!
---
Very well said! I’ve had several experiences like this! Hell! The guild I’m in now, I grouped up with the GM and a priest from the guild for the Redridge elites, then ran stocks with them. Ended up joining their guild and getting to know them quite a bit. I love this game!
---
Wonderful, isn’t it.
---
This is such an archaic mentality. Raids and certain dungeons aside, if the tank is being bad and pulling small groups that he clearly has no trouble handling, pulling an extra group helps reduce overall time.
---
Nobody wants to spend 2 hours in Scholomance.
---
yup i know saw some video where someone tanked naxx with it (private server i think) but it is still a "special" build
---
Voones are mail... he’s a rogue...
---
Nah he said he needed to go to do something he knew about before joining and thought we would be done
---
Holy shit, pertento lives. Rip kronos.
---
Oh you are Right. This was implemented with the pre patch for BC. Sry my mind was failing.
---
I'm on mobile, if there's a simple way of formatting please enlighten me.
---
Drag/drug/drug???
---
&gt;I approach ganking like I approach sex.
---
Playing on a PvE server then, I see.
---
Yes. There's no reason to use a higher level one other than its damage which we don't care about.
---
I did a run with 3 warriors and a mage once, the mage gave me two stacks of water and the warriors gave me whatever drinks and mana potions dropped.
---
Ended up at the end of the dungeon with a bunch of stacks of drinks and like 4 stacks of mana potions, great times
---
Also, don't pop Evade, as it WILL enable overpower, which WILL crit and makes you unable to vanish back into stealth.
---
Basically, if you're a rogue and thinking about entering PvP against a warrior, think about all the poor rogues I already slaughtered. A warrior is NOT an easy prey for a rogue. Go get some huntards, priests or mages instead, much juicier prey.
---
Nah but the proc is lit in PvP. Damage is secondary.
---
Its a blessing in disguise. If the amount of high level players is low that means ressources are easy to claim.
---
Weakauras can literally do anything, but it takes a loooong time to get the hang of it. If you need any help with creating something I could explain/make a [wago.io](https://wago.io) for you.
---
How to get Nice Damage to work? I unpacked to /addons and changed the name and it only shows xp gained, damge font remains the same. Should I paste the file somewhere else?
---
&gt;I don't know why we have the 'old' mount system. 
---
Because the "new" mount system was added practically in TBC prepatch. The vast majority of actual vanilla used this mount system so the devs went with it. Source being from the recent podcast esfand hosted with some of the classic devs. Can't really post a link at present.
---
The guide says its NOT viable and a fucking meme 😂😂
---
It can be hard to build initial threat on aoe packs especially, as most of our threat abilities can only hit 4 targets. Add miss parry parry to the start of a pull, and there's no more aggro to be had. Do you power word shield your tank? That's another way to both pull aggro off of them, and severely reduce their rage gain / threat.
---
Stuff like that I understand and will wait for but this was something he knew about prior and just thought we would be done
---
Experienced PvE mage here. The main thing is that one of the blue rings Maiden's circle goes almost for the same amount of gold that Freezing Band does. Secons of all it really adds up if you apply this logic for all your items. That 1 dps increase can be like 20 dps with all your gear chipping in and exactly - when all you do is frostbolt all the time, you have to get the edge over other mages somehow. You cannot do a better spell rotation or have much better mechanics than them. All it is about is slight advantages in gear, positioning so you can start casting asap and mana management. This is obviously for people that care about raid and boss damage meters, many people here wont even care about that.
---
Where is this location?
---
Someone is breaking that blind/gouge 100% in hopes that you die and they get the skin so try to not rely on it.
---
Fury 2h tanks have always been a legit strat for classic.
---
 Hate to break it to ya but cross realm battle group's have been confirmed already.  They were in vanilla too, just later on.
---
My new favourite thing is watching a Mage due after he tagged too many mobs in my questing area - I am a shadow priest.
---
Literally turned on his stream a few times and all I heard was "can someone give me X item?" "Can I get this from someone?" "Oh I want that" 
---
Sure he plays a lot but most if what he has has been given to him from what I see.
---
I'm looking for a EU pvp enlish server. I've done some research and it looks like Ashbringer, firemaw, skullflame and Razorgore are good options. Planning to play horde btw. Any  suggestions?
---
https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting
---
I didn't mind the silliness as much as getting kicked to a cutscene every five quests.
---
Yeah it's most 3 buttons and auto attack. In the steam link interface where you set up the touch controls there's 8 keys you can map to whatever you want so as long as you can map your rotation to those 8 and the input delay dsnt hurt your performance too much.
---
I agree with this point. Taking time out from questing/lvl'ing just to get money for a mount seems very inefficient, when you can just keep questing 40+, lvl faster and get the gold quite quickly from that.
---
he clicks!! O\_o
---
why are people still playing on private servers with classic out
---
Just let people fucking die. Tell them when they pull aggro that you don't give a fuck about them and if they pull they get to tank it.
---
This is how tanks did it back in the day when they were fed up with this shit and it took some time but it mostly worked in the end.
---
You have the responsibility to tank mobs but also let people die because of their stupidity. You are the judge, the jury and the executioner and the sooner DPSers learn that the better for everyone else.
---
Players have already been hit by bans. I saw a screenshot with a guy who got a 30 day ban.
---
RIP u/OwlrageousJones he died a very blue man.
---
I mained a mage in vanilla and a large part of TBC, it was so much easier to just throw stacks into open trade windows than have to look for whoever wanted any.
---
Of course I also ended up giving water to warriors and rogues because it was just easier to click on bread+water for everyone, but they also need to stay hydrated
---
As a tank; I've done a few AoE pew pew runs with guildies, because I know they're competent players and I have a lot of mobility as a feral to tank when I need to a charge out when I need to. It's all good fun with a competent, communicative group.
---
With randoms I ask them nicely to stop. If they don't, they find out just how expendable DPS are.
---
Eventually.
---
They are absurd. :D
---
Emerald Boi feat. Orc Thug - In da Bluff
---
just keep what you are doing now, your whole world will change at lvl 38, and then 40. So don't think about it that much right now.
---
38 is the biggest power spike, your deain health skill outdps wanding(hope you have the best wand possible), then you face tank everything and let succubus dps, this is the fastest tactic in terms of dps. you don't even touch your vw anymore at this point.
---
then at 40 you get your dark pact which increases your sustain big time. 
---
Ofc for this you go full affliction. don't give any talent to any other tree till you get dark pact
---
bullshit... emp is 59 you won't even hit your abilities.. stop spreading stupid bullshit, show me a video of this event otherwise I'd say stop talking out of your ass
---
The xp from dungeon farming is good if you have a good group. Doesn’t have to be an aoe comp. 
---
A dedicated aoe group is probably 30+% faster though.
---
I had a group for Scholomance the other day with a warrior tank, paladin healer (me), and boomkin/rogue/warlock dps.  
---
With the exception of myself accidentally falling into one of the holes in the floor by the whelp room, and one instance of the warlock pet having a spastic moment, the run was a buttery smooth and fast full clear.  
---
Mad AOE may be the most efficient way to do a lot of things, but is not the only way and it is often not satisfying either.
---
Man this sure is THE thing to complain about isn't it?
---
Fair enough. Might want to reply to the OP. I did say that Wowhead had a levelling guide though, so hopefully he checked that.
---
This has been the best advice thus far. And it's a tactic and macro I will be implementing
---
I'm 32 and haven't got to use the summoning spell yet. I was really looking forward to that utility since my buffs are pretty arse.
---
Carrot on a Stick (3% mount speed)
---
:(

I also mean the red shirt, shoulderpads, cape. Where to get those?

Agree.

Dont buy skills you dont need. Dont buy items. You can. Make the gold instance farming SM pretty easily from 30-40 so I'd do that.

You just jinxed it.

Until you meet that pack with more than 1 mob 😅

That is the one i'm talking about. Thanks, didn't know.

When I get to Scholomance I want to be able to enjoy the nostalgia of playing it and soak it all in, not have some angry gnome mage constantly screeching to go faster
---
If anyone is looking for a healer on Alliance feel free to shoot me a friend request. My character name is Gonja.
---
You get more and more gold the higher your level. Are you training all your skills, even the ones you don't use? Don't do that.
---
Your cleave groups are doing it wrong
---
Honestly, just questing is faster. Sure you won't have your mount at level 40, but it'll probably be less time until you have it, and you'll have gained more exp.
---
feign death was also on that list...
---
lmao :D

Lmao, who hurt you so bad you had to make a post about this?

They're a healer or a buffbot that plays like a dps.

You are so very right, kind sir!

Quick head up: Spy Addon, where you can put enemies to the "immidiately kill" list :)
---
Mine is already quite full.
---
My solution to this is to give my opponent a fair chance.  Usually if I walk up to a guy fighting a mob I will /stare them down and wait until they are back at full health/mana.. then proceed to immolate their faces off..
---
Google up some classic wow warrior leveling guides (wowhead had some good guides for other classes at least), these should hold plenty of info, both on leveling and perhaps also on skills that are not crucial to buy/upgrade.
---
You can respec your talents (you will get 1 talent point / level from level 10 onwards), but you really should look up a talent build you want to level with beforehand. The first respec costs 1g, then 5, 10 etc all the way up to 50g. It is generally not advised to respec until later in the game, as these amounts of gold are huge for the first 10's of levels. I'm postponing my (first) respec to 54-60 somewhere.
---
&gt; My fear is that without layering, we'll see tons of farmers in one location as opposed to farmers being divided over many layers.
---
That's literally the issue.
---
i don't see  [questie](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie), absolute a must for leveling.
---
Ashbringer is the one!
---
He’s the president now...
---
Yes, if you want to drain tank it's an absolute must. Even if you don't I'd still recommend it, you only have to give up improved CoA and improved lifetap for it and those aren't worth very much in leveling.
---
For reference, I have 5/5 in both first row talents, nothing in row two, and fel conc with amp curse in row three. Then you only need 2/2 nightfall and 2/2 grim reach t get to row 5 (if you want to go past row 4 aff)
---
In demo, I'd recommend going to improved vw for sure but consider going even deeper for mast summoner. You have a MAJOR pvp advantage being able to sac vw twice in a fight or being able to change pet instantly. Depends on your preference though.
---
actually BDO style would be amazing but there are just so many skills in wow, not like in BDO. How is that gonna be even possible in this case?
---
Can this addon for example bind my shadowbolt skill to shift right click, meanwhile just right click is normal wand shooting? or it has nothing to do with the addon?
---
I believe a huge concern was PvP as well, like layering in combat or something. But I think its gonna be gone before the Honor System comes out
---
You need to get hit more, that's an obvious example of too low defense skill compared to the enemy level.
---
Ignore and move on.

wiped realy often from them, i hate those

Is there any addon like DrDamage for Classic?
---
It will ruin the economy in a heartbeat.
---
Yeah why shit where you eat.
---
If im done with a zone i also gank on the way out. But that has backfired when the alliance quest line follows the same path and i meet my victims 15 minutes later.
---
Nah, he had 5 lvl60 alliance around killing every lowbies on sight.
---
Hahaha. Mage slaves 😍 But what fight is this on? And how is your gear?
---
I picked a hybrid class with a dps spec that benefits others instead of myself. Especcially if I get my maclvl weapon that I want...
---
#goodchristianman
---
Kk then I will put the new talents I have into the interrupt when draining and keep working my way down. My gear isn’t the greatest I haven’t ran many dungeons just been questing around maxing professions as I go. I just feel like when I need to grind a little bit it sucks, but I’ll wait it out. I came from playing priest and rogue in vanilla so lock is definitely different.
---
It's in the .32 version, which is still in alpha. If you click on Files and then View All,  you should see that one.
---
Haha you’re exactly the same as me one week ago. Built my pc last week and played wow all weekend for the first time since wrath. It didn’t disappoint!
---
Are you 12?
---
Hunters and rogues were incredibly popular in vanilla but classic is different because we know the dmg every class does and it won't change. Warriors and mages/warlocks outdps hunters and rogues so people gravitate more towards them.
---
There are also a lot more priests around than there used to be. People know which classes perform well and pick them.
---
He's probably saying this exact same thing to every class, just to fill the roster and make the guild seem serious by personally asking people
---
Is there any queue on peak hours?
---
Things like this are why im glad I played back then, hidden knowledge that you can share with new classic players
---
Walking as intended.
---
When do I need to start using the AH? So far just been vendoring everything at 21 atm.
---
Oh just like the person that is most in need of medical attention is the one that can afford it the most? It's almost comically ironic how these two measures always magically lign up, right?
---
PvP gods with BiS gear usually hangs out outside IF / orgrimmar and flex in duels. 
---
World pvp is usually one clueless idiot vs another, just how i like it.
---
You guys remember day one, when there was literally a giant line to get a mob spawn, or a circle jerk around every spawn spot? With out layering. It would be that way through the entire game.
---
Yes there is some economic disruption and some potential for exploit. But it's the price the community must pay, to actually be able to play... Otherwise you'd be stuck in 6 hour queues again, or if you did log in, stuck in line for a mob.
---
It's weird Alliance can stand 2 ft away from the door near the Horde Flight Master. Kill the Flight master, and any player in town, and not aggro any bruisers, and you are aggroing them pretty far from the entrance.
---
That is an amazing wpvp trio you have there.
---
what a great game and what a great time we had with uol, best game ever made and still enjoyable today.
---
Weather effects, aggro, and deathwing in quest text gotta be the top 3.
---
Showing IT on one screen is also less taxing.my FPS close to douled.
---
Where did you get the masque:skin? I can not find the "Shadow"-Skin anywhere.. Can you help me out?
---
2010? LoL more like grey boxy screen from 1997
---
warning, 3day ban, 1month, 6month, perma
---
just have to be reported enough and stupid enough to keep doing it
---
Farming itself is DEFINITELY an issue here, and layered farming can have extremely harmful effects on the economy. 
---
That said, it also greatly detracts from the classic experience itself.   Major cities looking more like ghost towns than central hubs filled with a community, and altered world PvP experience if a raid is taking place on a layer other than your own.  
---
The main (and imo only) benefit of layering was to decrease competition for mobs at launch until the level distribution is more balanced for leveling, e.g. you don’t have 30,000 level 1s fighting over 20 wolves, so that people could actually complete quests and progress.
---
The technicality does not solve the underlying issue. 
---
That’s precisely it though. The ability to be all 3 specs whenever, and the inability to mix and match, to experiment much. Flashy stuff does not an intriguing class make, and long term it’s makes for poor class identity and fantasy.
---
Wait, so layering ISN'T the issue, it being taken away is the issue then? I assumed Blizzard was removing layering because the playerbase wanted it gone, I'm guessing that's not the case?
---
Get convection. Its the best T1 talent. Ele mental devistation wont do a thing for you.
---
I would use the ele talents from 1-30 respec to enhance at 30. Respec back to ele at 40 + buy spelldmg gear
---
Well it’s kind of limited bc ah 
---
It was passive farming 
---
Just buying everything in ah that’s worth it 
---
Cook it and then vendor it 
---
The long part is the cooking during which I was eating/watching YouTube so it wasn’t that bad but not consistent
---
This is an awesome picture
---
Tabarnak represent!
---
I really cba AHing so Ill be more than happy vendoring everything. Just wondering at what point the gap becomes huge enough that everyone should be AHing. Thank you!
---
I think when everybody reserved names most went for warrior as it's was faster so a lot of lvl warriors will just be name holders atm, also bank alts are often warriors.
---
Been soloing then at 56 hunter it’s great. That pic should be of King Mosh, you do not want to fuck with him
---
Thank you.
---
Yup, mages are turning into the new hunters/rogues.  Already ran into a few facepalm mages.
---
What is the glitch? Hate posts like this, that are not specific ..
---
Bear in mind that with the increased playercount on a server. Yes resource acquisition does increase, due to increase farming. But so does demand for said resources. More people crafting items for a larger playerbase to utilize.
---
Hordeing or rare materials (unless illegally gained) comparitively isnt any bigger a problem then it ever was.
---
Ok.. i don’t know if you solved your problem but I had the same exact one until I just kept making class race combination and looking at the 60 gear for all of them and i finally just knew what i wanted, just keep trying them all till you feel comfortable
---
In an instance, your "getting fucked" fucks the whole party.
---
The big appeal of broken tooth is that he is the best at pushing back casts in pvp bc of his atk speed 
---
Dps wise it doesn’t matter that much I think
---
Use the main hand weapon, which in our case is the fishing rod.
---
&gt;Hunters were never a commonly played class.
---
That is not my recollection. In vanilla there were Hunters everywhere.
---

I’m looking forward to come to Maraudon with my shaman and getting Princess 2h Mace 😍
---
&gt; blizzard didn’t do the best job with quest descriptions
---
They're still an order of magnitude better than the ones we have now in retail, if you're trying to navigate by looking at the world and not a flashy thing on the minimap.
---
Even the terribly vague quests give you *some* hint where to go.
---
Than I'm sorry I didn't want to be elitist in anyway, I was just well disappointed that someone was indeed critising my way of playing and might chose the wrong words. For reference, I really love WoW and I know I can get carried away it's been 5 long years since I last enjoyed the game and the change in culture is still surprising for me sometimes.
---
Beat me to it
---
Tell him you have found your long lost love and need to go on a Quest to find them. But you will never forget your time together. Something along those lines.
---
Is it really patched if all of SW changed?
---
You may not see it, but it happens :D
---
Tell that to the 20 plus alliance players that got one shotted from the southshore inn by a lvl 60 hunter that the guards could not path to. The hunter had so much fun he brought 2 other 60s on top of the roof, again where the guards can't reach. Real life scenario that happened an hour ago.
---
As a rogue this makes me happy :) 
---
I actually have a fellow rogue friend who at 58 is considering to reroll, simply because its so hard to find groups as a rogue in this meta (Also because people for some reason has the perception of rogues that they are all fucking jerks or 12-year olds)
---
Also, people dont seem to realize that rogues actually got amazing “aoe” in blade flurry, and in classic where you often take breaks and it actually takes some time to kill shit, a 2 min cd for aoe is actually not so bad. And unlike mages (and other aoe classes) rogues also got amazing threat control in feint and vanish. Ofc I am biased in this, but can definetly recommend bringing a rogue ^^
---
Usually around 6-10 hours. Keep in mind that I had vacation the first 2 weeks. During that time I slept 5 hours and played 19, every single day. After those 2 weeks my average playtime was only 9 hours a day, which leaves me with 8 hours to do other stuff when I want to sleep for 7 hours.
---
They meant to ask if you're going to launch a kickstarter for the comic book.
---
In that line of thought are you going to present it at a comic con when it's out?
---
my rule is not ganking grey levels, everything else is toast if I get the chance.
---
reroll now, before the server dies.
---
In classic it was server based for a long period of time. But I think just before BC they made it cross-server; or was it after BC? if that's the case then... RIP.
---
My face when I run with some constantly threat pulling AoE crazed mage and do more damage than them single-target on my hunter half in whites.
---
Bra.... Right in the feels. This is me to a tee! But when wow classic is lyfe, you adapt.
---
ask him to invite for layer
---
This is true for good 5 man groups, since dungeon monsters die so fast when you get geared anyways
---
Whoever makes an accurate enemy debuff timer addon (the current one is omegalol inaccurate) will have the #1 spot in downloads
---
How did cata take that away? Instead of alot of "dull" stats talents leading to the same major abilities/ talents for everyone going say arms/ fury as an example  
---
With the cata system you get like 4/5 rows (can't remember how many rows you had in cata) with 3 more impactfull talents from which can you pick and chose how you like = more diffrent builds to play around with and try to make work
---
This site tells us that warriors are #1 dps in phase 1 and shows us a graph on the front page saying that the max recorded war dps was 1.2k+
---
... Complete utter nonsense... I'll Just challenge you to go look through the ACTUAL recorded and submitted parses on that site yourselves and tell me where in those parses you see the warriors at on average, which is not at #1 but maybe occasionally a few in the top 5 or top 10, but ONLY on horde side with wf totems. 
---
Also the average dps of all of those top classes often doesnt even hit 300, which is way more accurate to how it actually was in vanilla before people were in full aq/naxx gear. And im NOT making this up, the submitted parses are all there, look them up yourself, but if you actually raided already in classic already and checked the dps meters from time to time during bosses you know it.
---
I have no idea why some people constantly feel the need to try and spread such misinformation and make people believe that 1.2k+ dps is possible in phase 1 (probably just due to a single completely scuffed parse thats been submitted) or that \~600+ dps should be a realistic goal with prebis gear ect. I also highly question if the developers of that website have any clue of what "aggregate" averages means.
---
I think that's the addon itself. It recalls info so it can do its job. If it didn't how would it know prices to post at..
---
they dont, they have some cd's which are tied to a totem visual, there is no totems, just cooldowns.
---
good money maker grind spot are the turtles on the beach in tanaris especially when you have skinning
---
Sad times.
---
I'd certainly have left the group shortly afterwards if he wasn't pulling his weight.
---
pretty much. i ended up on a pvp server to play with friends. they quit. so my character that i put a lot of hours into is stuck on a pvp server that has a much higher population of the opposite faction. @_@
---
Get a fast attack speed cat. Look for one with 1.2 attack speed until lvl 37 when you can tame brokentooth.  
---
Good for pvp, and also pve in the sense it will keep frenzy up 100% of the time, with just 3-4 points in it.
---
Hold up.. dismissing your pet lowers its happiness??? I never noticed it
---
How do you get the player level to show up in your target frame with ElvUI? Been trying to figure that out since release.
---
I play also to relax and iam most relaxed after kick some alli asses ;) 
---
PvP is perfect for casuals
---
That autoshot on tab *is* a pain to get used to after retail, no lie.
---
Your distance to the mob does not affect how much threat you do. What it does is affect how much threat you need to pull aggro. In melee range you need to have 110% threat to pull aggro, while at range you need 130% threat to pull aggro. You do the same amount of threat no matter how far away you are tho.
---
Yeah settled on druid :) Thanks for the reply though. I think a lot of the gear looks great so that would probably just confuse me more xD
---
Get an owl with screech. Great at tanking and holding multiple mobs.
---
how hard are they to kill and how  rare?
---
It’s strange ; haven’t clean my GPU in ages and yet there is no dirt on my screen, only a big ass orc
---
Yes. Did you?
---
Say it with me
---

---
I relish seeing a mage asking for a "normal" Dungeon group. Hate seeing AOE Spam this and that. Just do not see the fun in it at all. I understand streamers etc doing it for content when 60 but not the regular player. Quest and enjoy the game as it has been made ffs.
---
I have a list of people I don't wanna to tank for ever again.
---
Left more than one party because they invited one on them.
---
There's literally no reason for the Tauren to be allied to the Forsaken due to the plague shit they pull, of with the Orc since they started logging thousand-years old trees in Ashenvale, but, eh... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Link him **[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]** a few times a day.

Looks great! I wish you luck. If i had found an English Speaking community I probably would have played on the Korean server from Japan. (now on OCE)
---
What zone is this?
---
Cleave group with good players, magical. With 80% of everyone else? Total shit show
---
Ooooh okay, been a while since then
---
Haha this is so nice! I always spend way to much time thinking that it's juuuust not exactly aligned.
---
The tank is the father of the group. He sets rules and takes the hits, doing his upmost to protect his family. He leads and, where necessary, disciplines. 
---
The DPS are the children. They can either be well behaved, or they leave a mess around while making everyone's lives more miserable.  
---
The healer is the mother of the group. She supports the tank and cleans up after the children. Often the hardest lesson for the children is when their mother refuses to shield the children from the consequences of failing to abide by the rules of the father. She doesn't like seeing them suffer, but a lesson needs to be learned to make them better people in the long run.
---
Excellent! Natural selection, let the hardcore remain behind
---
Exactly how I see it now. My view was very different back in high school though, I always felt guilty that I was wasting my life on wow even though I was poor back then and had no money to go do much anyways. Now I’m a full-time pharmacist and I am certain my time spent on wow isn’t a waste. I really enjoy this game, especially raiding, and I save a lot of money on the side that I can put towards student loans or whatever so if it makes me happy I don’t see why not. All things in moderation and all that, but no one should feel bad about playing wow if they have a lazy Sunday in Azeroth for 10 hours on their day off.
---
I really doubt about the playerbase.. Retail is like a cheap mobile game where you really like the story but the gameplay is bullshit. People will run over the content without noticing anything in the game around them, just chasing the "endgame". When you realize the "endgame" is the same boring thing you just ran through, you stop playing until the next content drop. And thats what ACTIVISION-blizzard want - people paying for content expansions, not necessarily playing the game. 
---
World of Warcraft is an amazing MMORPG, it should have gone upwards from the beginning, instead it lost (I think more than half of the initial) playerbase, all the while there is no serious competition on the MMORPG scene. In my eyes WoW failed more and more with every expansion, but I guess I am no longer the target audiance for that game - it is the new "gender" gamers that like to be handed every reward with little to no effort and nose-lead through the quest lines (despite playing "open world" game).
---
WoW Classic on the other hand returned to us what was a true open world RPG game at heart. I really hope they continue in that direction after all the phases. And judging by the current amount of FULL Classic servers every evening this is not only my opinion.
---
Just to be clear - I levelled up 2 characters in BfA, I really wanted to like it, gave it numerous chances but the poor quality (and several serious bugs) of the quests along the way, combined with the empty dungeons (as they do not scale in level you can never find a full party to run one of those lower-than-110-level dungeons) convinced me little attention is given to most of the game. Rather developers focus on pushing new content for more money.
---
Yup you’re correct, you can pretty much 2h tank everything until 45-50ish dungeons. Shit, I prefer my tanks to 2h in all the sm runs I’ve done.
---
If you're talking about that quest where you put some totem thing down and defend it from waves of dudes, I drunkenly managed to find it correctly.
---
I just started running down the road east-ish and was telling my party "it's gotta be off to the south here somewhere!" as they tried to get me to wait.  I triumphantly announced that I'd found a furbolg-looking thing and ran in to look for some hill/mound/whatever and only then realized I'd run like halfway across the damn map.
---
TL;DR: drunk Ashenvale is best Ashenvale.
---
It’s fun to min/max and see how fast you can be. Experimenting with pulls, weighing risk of wipe vs. speed is also fun. I’m not a hardcore player by any means, but when everyone’s playing well and things are going quick, it’s awesome.
---
That’s really wholesome, man.
---
Honestly, you sound exactly like awful mages we group with.  Not understanding that dungeons is a **group** activity, and instead of doing what the **group** wants you are off doing your own thing because you are “skilled” and “know better”. 
---
You know exactly how much damage each frostbolt and blizzard tick does ... but you don’t know how to sheep without being asked
---
Thoradin's Wall, if memory serves me well.
---
I can't comprehend how you're getting upvotes
---
With my Mage I've been using a pre-planned three-man questing route for highest efficiency. For my Rogue, I just did whatever zone I felt like doing. 3 days /played for 40 is fast compared to the average, you'll probably take around 8 days /played until 60. Average is 10 days I believe.
---
  \-Rogues in my groups, As they seem to have the highest rate of being funny people so far as ive been playing.
---
Rogue here- can confirm, am hilarious
---
Some people still have them? Wow. I really thought even the fullest of full servers were okay by now.
---
Thank you very much! I'll take a look at it when I get home!
---
You could have started your interesting response with Yep! Instead of Nope, and it would have addressed the dude you were responding to better-er.
---
Fucker gets what he deserves for ganking 2 on 1.
---
Depends on the server. They go for 6 to 8 gold on my server.
---
Based on economics 101 you would be correct. But economics assumes an actual functional economy that didn't start less than a month ago.
---
That's the issue.  Low population servers don't have the same incoming cash flow as high pop
---
&gt; 1.12 wasn't the last patch before BC. The last patch was 2.0.x which was the pre-expansion patch that introduced new 41 pt talents, dark portal opening and such. This was before BC launch itself.
---
Aye I missed you disagreed with it being the last past. I don't disagree with that statement and I should have been more clear. My apologies. 
---
&gt; It's true that 1.12 made the game easier compared to release, but this difference is nowhere near enough to account for the difference we're seeing.
---
I never mentioned that, I simply replied to the notion that you wrote "people were far worse" as if it was a counter-argument to players being buffed. 
---
&gt; When BWL, AQ and naxx get steamrolled, their mechanics are ignored, and their enrage timers are laughed at, maybe you'll admit that.
---
I think you misunderstood the notion of what I wrote with your reply.
---
Posts like this will turn this sub into a simllar shit hole like r/gaming
---
Hunters are great raid dps. They don’t start to fall off until AQ40/Naxx but they compete very strongly until then. And that’s a long ways off.
---
Been in the game for over 10 years.
---
I wanted to player hate you because youre horde. but then i saw you ganking nelves and gnomes. Keep it up!
---
If you are asking about dungeons, it really depends on your healer. Early on there's not much in ways of gear that boost your mana pool, let alone regen (outside of 5s of casting) and nothing whatsoever in the +healing department. Going OOM is a very real thing, and the small bonus of "potential mitigation" scales with number of mobs hitting you and adds up very fast. You can try going 2h, but don't expect it to work in many cases. Keep an eye on your healer's mana.
---
I'm a healing druid lvl 31.  
---
In dungeons, most of the time I don't need to heal the tank every mob, so I would like to DPS instead of staying idle. It puts my character in bad situations :
---
- I use my staff to DPS : very low damage, melee range =&gt; sucks
---
- I use my spells to DPS : good damage, heavy mana consumption that could be a problem in case of sudden need to heal a lot (Potions have 2 min cd, it's not enough)
---
- I morph into bear/cat form. No mana issue if you don't abuse it, good dps, but I'm in melee range and if something goes wrong, morphin back to human could take the millisecond that kills my tank. 
---
So how do you DPS as a druid when your main role is healer?
---
I was 38 with 40g on Sunday morning. After a day of Swamp of Sorrow circuit I was 40 with 80g. I then borrowed 10g off 2 friends as they were low 30s. I highly recommend Swamp of Sorrows especially the whelps if you can get them to yourself.
---
Go off of looks. Both orc and undead are stellar.  Stun resist and WotF are both killer in pvp and neither race has any meaningful advantage in pve
---
Sunder armor on CTRL + 2? Enjoy your carpal tunnel when tanking
---
Never played a pally, so no idea how the threat works on them.  Mages can't pull agro off a war either, if they let them have a few seconds at the start to gain control/rage.  If they start aoe'ing before the tank even tickle the mobs to start building rage, i'd imagin it would be similar to a pally starting with an empty mana bar.
---
If the current group of mages would do something like frost bolt x2 on the skull then open up with aoe I could see it possibly being more efficient than single all the way.  The problem is that's not what is happening, at least in the pubs on my server.  It's: I get the target marked and hit with ffire...then ice rains down before I even contact the group and I spend time trying to gather the rest of the runners.  But while I'm doing that the skull has turned and headed for the st dps, exept the one who went after a runner who now has his own.  Bout this time the healer is blowing mana on small heals on each of the 3 taking damage, my taunt is on cooldown and I still have no rage...and am spending time running between 3 mobs instead of hitting.  The mage has run out of cc exept for bliz and has two mobs chassing him down the hall and still hasn't cast sheep.  We get it under control...but the next pull goes the same exact way and it takes forever.
---
Aux no question
---
Ah, so artisan enchanter in Elvynn was added in BC... Sorry for misinforming you, then.
---
This is my main rule also. Though also I don't attack skull levels. Mostly I'll attack someone if they're competing for mobs. I don't attack randoms on the road unless I recognise them as someone who's killed me before.
---
You’ve heard of being facetious, surely ?
---
"Is it left or right Gandalf?"
---
Updated bartender in curseforge? Maybe try re-install the addon and try again
---
There’s a lot of really bad mages atm and spellcleave highlights their shortcomings because it requires good synergy and timing to work effectively, particularly when there are enemy casters to be dealt with.
---
I hate the streamers for popularising it because they’ve made it really challenging for us experienced AiE grinders to find a competent group since everyone and their dog is trying their hand at it at the moment.
---
I mean an extremely accurate one might take some work, but I don’t see it as a particularly complicated challenge. You won’t be able to tell what players were only clinging to retail in anticipation for classic, sure, but the insane spike in sub counts is measureable enough. I can’t forget that there was literally a Que, not for login into the game, but for subscribing.
---
A Mage Rank 1 frostbolted me to death yesterday and there was nothing I could do about it. And he knew. He **knew**.
---
Its bad when aoe drops on the moment of pull but if it was a blizzard mobs at least would be menagable.
---
"accidentally" pressing need has happened since the dawn of time.  Do you think people would belive that even if it was the truth?   
---
Why did you not /roll for it again if it was a blue BoE?  
---
If this is true, im happy ninja looters catch shit.
---
You'll have to provide more than "none of them work", because Bartender's profiles seem to work fine for me.  You could always get something like VuhDo and heal that way.
---
I believe FFXIV does not release sub numbers either, though it's theorized to be lower than BFA's lowest via census data. It also has micro-transactions.
---
Hahaha I did the same shit
---
I wouldn't have explained it, just left it at the uh-oh. Good stuff either way!
---
They were so angry because people invest a huge amount of time in the game. Finding a group, doing a dungeon, and then hoping that item drops narrow the chances of you getting what you ideally want to a minimum. When an item drops, they get a high, and when you ninja, they get a deep low.
---
With two clicks on a wrong button (yes you confirmed to NEED), you undid all of it because you were careless.
---
Others follow to scold you because it was true, you ninja'd.
---
Learn your lesson, don't be a ninja.
---
inb4 "It's just a game." - stop it, people are invested emotionally and time wise.
---
I'm a level 16 warrior thinking of starting to run some dungeons, never played wow before now. Are there any guides I should read before getting into it? I really don't know what I should be doing ok a group...
---
It's completely random how many times and how often she does
---
Bought a new house in May in preparation of release after having the second baby. Needed a place with an extra bedroom to set up the computer obviously.
---
High five! I love it, all I have to worry about is the shit-useless mages pulling mobs back into my deadzone.
---
Oh BfA is horrible! I resubbed for Classic, dinged 13 and gave up at the amount of walking needed - this is no complaint, Classic is great, walking is an integral part and I had a lot of cool moments but I simply can't force myself to do it all over again. So, I started playing retail only to get Pathfinder part 2 and that alone killed my will to play WoW for the foreseable future.
---
damn that's kinda awesome!
---
Started levelling a priest, what should I do in terms of rotation? So far I've been popping PWS, Mind Blast, SWP, and then Smite till out of mana then wanding them down
---
Firemaw-EU has 1 hour queue in the evenings
---
Doubt druids can really do this without distract that rogues get
---
Report them all and enjoy how Blizzard bans them. For real I got a 3 month Ban for HS and OW just for suggesting someone to buy them a chair and a rope. They have a Zero tolerance when it comes to this.
---
And yes this happens to the best of us. Relax.
---
Sadly if the Person was 'famous streamer xy' people will continue riding the shame train.
---
They really should have let you get away with crazy shit using Mind Control.
---
&gt; "get rid of layers and let 3K play while everyone else sits in the queue"
---
Oh....oh dear. Yeah that is actually concerning. I'm playing on literally the only EU RP server (chose to go EU servers back in the day, and just stuck with it), I don't even want to imagine what the queues for that is going to look like.
---
What do you mean /roll. It was a drop from some mob in SM. Its not like hey lets /roll when there is a need/greed/pass window. Ive never seen that in 12 years of playing wow.
---
if it was BoE you could have just had everyone /roll for it and traded it to the highest roll. or if people are assholes, fuck em, make some gold. i have accidentally hit need. it happens. just be up front about it and if people want to be immature, let them and don't feel bad about getting the item.
---
This ain't it, fam.
---
Right click your chat windows and it’ll let you make a new one. Then you can pick what chats are shown in that window in the settings
---
&gt; I have zero faith in current Blizz doing this. 
---
I am 110% certain they will make Retail even worse, and most likely move it to mobile in 10.0, because with less than 500k players left and MTX being 83% of Retail income, there is ZERO reason to keep in on PC.
---
Love this
---
This has to be somewhat deliberate though? If they can control the amount of people entering any one shard they must have set it to a lower population?
---
Right? Joined a "BRD Anger/Argel/Emp Farm" group yesterday, and after the (very successfull) killing of the first 2 bosses, 3 people were like "g2g, gotta eat". Like, what?
---
Because it wasn't how vanilla worked. Fighting for farming spots is part of the game and what made some things expensive.
---
There will be a significant player base for quite some time. The real question is how Blizzard handles the population decline on each individual realm.
---
I'm happy to claim that man as my husband any day :)
---
Plus, he wrecked my opportunity to pimp him out for mount gold so it was all ruined anyway...
---
Congrats mate, I have finished mine 2 days ago. Super proud.
---
Think about this for a second,  this robe is better than  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=21343#reward-of](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21343#reward-of)  from C'thun..
---
You said it was BoE.. 
---
Did you give the item back? Or did you keep it?
---
So when the entire group is cloth wearers and they all needed on a plate armor item doesnt make them a ninja too. Makes sense
---
Idk what's worse, this or those who cry and say something along the lines of "Blizzard watered down the difficulty for all of the newcomers".
---
Maybe you're just better at the game because you've played it for 15 years? Just because you've not played vanilla in 13~ years doesn't mean your foundational knowledge of the game itself hasn't gotten way better.
---
The game's foundation has and probably will always be the same. Basically, just level, get the right gear with the right stats, know your rotation (which really hasn't changed that much for some classes), and know how to not stand in the fire.
---
I've created two profiles in Bartender and macros to switch between them. This works.
---
If I change profile and rearrange skills or change hotkeys, and proceed to change profile, nothing changes. So the two profiles are always the same. Is there a secret command I need to use to save profiles when using Bartender?
---
Weird how lots of PvP focused players went horde. I get that orcs and undead are strong by themselves, but have fun losing all your bgs vs competent paladin healers. BoP, bubble, freedom, insane ST healing, and the most mana effecient healer in the game. Ez claps.
---
Wow this is perfekt, thanks man.
---
Yep retardation
---
Gives the other player a window to take advantage of.
---
The entire party needed and i ended up winning the item (plate as cloth user) but there was no plate user in our party at all
---
Or just to have a break from all the walking!
---
Where did you grind? And in the basic sence of just killing mobs? Is that better money? 
---
I'm kinda stuck in the 30's right now and would love to try something else than what I'm doing now.
---
Streamer man bad
---
&gt; the most iconic single Shaman spell in the history of the game. Heroism/Bloodlust which is a TBC addition.
---
At best, that is subjective. But you are going to find a heck of a lot of people disagreeing with you on that one. Shamans Frost Shock has been notorious and iconic since forever.
---
Now, if you had written in the history of the Warcraft franchise and not the game, then sure, I would agree. 
---
Now, if you had written the
---
I cannot believe this is what you got from what I wrote. Nowhere did I say or insinuate that.
---
My guild dropped one on Sulfuron-France!
---
Yeah that's true, but the guy you replied to was asking to move the party frames. Which you can't do with leatrix plus.
---
As a healer, I heavily disagree with this. I want to have a good time and actually focus and pay attention. I love using my abilities, and I have no problem with healing other people that aren't the tank. It's draining imo when the tank is incapable of putting good DPS/Heals to use.
---
My fastest was 5 hours with RAF 300% on a pair of monks. Normally now it's around 8-12hr's, depending on role.
---
I work primarily outdoors, reading physical documents, and driving to and from locations. WoW is so perfect for me as a time sink, but then again, I have a whole host of other different issues. I work in agriculture or should I say aquaculture, which means that I’m operating way away from big cities and tons of people. Since I’m in the middle of nothing, my ping sucks balls. Leveling fishing is/was an absolute nightmare for me.
---
You're hopefully joking
---
&gt;You said it was a blue BOE. So its tradable.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Just have everyone type /roll, and if you win, you keep it. And if someone else win they get it. That's how someone who played the game for 12 years would have done it. Unless...they are a ninja.
---
Don't do this quest. His wife is obviously abusive, he leaves her every time you bring him back.
---
Yeah because community can be only against it or support it, nothing between.
---
5-15 gold per SM run?
---
Damn, I am doing it wrong apparently.
---
true but doesent the exctra armor and resistence make up for that in the long run? on top of that in pve content you are ofcourse giving bether bufs for raids and dungeons.
---
I guess the author didn't get to either fixing it or uploading on curseforge. The version on wowinterface (link in the OP) works fine, just have to install it manually.
---
since it's a boe you could have /rolled for it and traded it to whoever got the highest roll
---
I don’t think the question is “am I allowed to do this?” So much as “is this reasonably efficient?”. I’m assuming that’s what he _wants_ to do.
---
Filthy horde scum, watch your mouth, lest ye loose it!
---
When you go into the target frame, select the name tab where the name is displayed and edit the default string. I can't remember the default, but it will include \[name\] just add \[level\] afterwards. I believe my one is just \[name\] \[difficultycolor\]\[level\]. The difficulty color just showing gray/green/red depending on the target's level of course. 
---
I'll triple check when I get home today to make sure the above is correct.
---
Look at all this healthy meme-ing
---
I did 11 runs, i just skip the nearest box to the boss. For a dog that he distract , you can jump behind it on little ledge without aggro unstealthed. 
---
But after a while, i found out its easier just to kill the dog with cat form.

Never actually.

try warframe, GW2 or ESO out!
---
it's perfect for WoW veterans
---
WoW tokens are part of the paid services. Whales buy them a lot.
---
I was ranked so much on my server. And when legion included multiple realms on the server I could.barely level. I was alliance. 
---
Classic however? I'm Horde. And you can make damn sure I'm killing every ally I can when I come across them.
---
lol someone rolled 99 better take a screenshot with my phone and save this special moment.
---
This is reputation bar isn't it ?
---
I have never once three month subbed to an MMO and I've played dozens of them. I always pay for one month at a time. Cancel so that it does not automatically rebill. Then reactivate when the time runs out if I want to continue playing.
---
Depends on your goals, if your more PvP orientated I would say furor. If your going PvE and doing some PvP, I would agree with you.
---
He meant, manually typing /roll after your "accident". Something like "Oh shit guys, sorry, I needed by accident. Let me make it up by letting you re-roll. I'll excempt myself from this roll and give the BoE to the winner".
---
Would have saved you a lot of spite.
---
Rogue here, yes i do this on purpose just to fuck with you
---
I liked it.
---
Tell him you like Alinity and support her animal throwing
---
\^ What this guy said. Better look up materials now before that shit hits the roof.
---
its allways funny how people act like there isnt a problem its a fact that if u dont count pve server horde is a lot more people once layering is removed and honor system comes on a lot of ally will prob quit out of frustration and good luck with the bg queu on hord side xD
---
You are using a special add on that changes the interface.
---
Bartender specifically you need to find the "xp bar" and uncheck the box. Not art, art is like the ping and background stuff.
---
Fight green mobs
---
Wow :( /s
---
How does a VPN affect bans at all? They are looking at the account, not the IP
---
Dude. You just type in chat: "Oops my bad. Guys lets /roll again ill pass it to the winning guy".  Then everyone /roll and whoever wins gets item. Otherwise yeah, you dont deserve the amount of hate, but you ninja'd that item.
---
But aoe mages dont really care. Stuff can be kited
---
we had a lvl 46 2H tank mara princess with a 47 heal shaman - it's completely fine
---
Yes. Broken Tooth is good against casters without instant casts in pvp. But that's it. 
---
If you min/max, sure. But if you prefer another pet, it's not a big deal. My Vanilla Hunter had a tiger and a wolf and was a Tauren. I still was rank 11 and had my share of wins in PvP.
---
If you like BT, tame it. But if you just have it for the pvp-caster-scenario, it doesn't hurt to go for another pet.
---
Everything is so compact, but they need a high level blacksmith.
---
Yeah got to 40 on my hunter, did my LW specialization (dragonscale) and said "I feel complete". Game time nearly done, but was lucky to get a wow token 11th hour so there's a balance. Planning to come back in November for the 15th anniversary. I should push to 60 just fine then. 
---
Back in vanilla, I think I took a week to go from 59 to 60.
---
Wanted to move faster. :P
---
But yeah, you and Carsonica may be right. Cheers.
---
k
---
Trust me if your about to run for these your still in front of almost everyone. Don't compare your self to streamers and people without a job.
---
Ty anyway
---
what skill mate? I cleared MC twice with my guild and aoe farming few packs was significantly harder than pressing frostbolt a over and over until raggy died lol
---
Dominos works just fine for me (exp bar is a little wonky though
---
People strike gold if they get a tank that isn't a wanker, straight on the friends list
---
I'll also add that AdvanceInterfaceOptions allows to change alot of different Cvars really easily, by letting you search all the available ones, showing you their current setting value and changing it. You can set thi gs such as world text scale size, which scales the size of the font of the xp recieved message and the floating combat text size above enemies heads. It lets change a Cvar for ways showing XP text on the bar instead of just on hover. The list goes on, very useful addon.
---
ah go away! ... i hate you ... i totaly hate you ... you and your lovely mount ... so take my upvote ... that grind ...
---
pristine black diamond for 20g ezgame
---
Um wait....so these kinds of offers are being serious? I saw a mage selling portals to Orgrimmar myself....and he was in undercity.
---
The Zeppelin is literally just outside. If it was ports TO and FROM Thunderbluff, I can understand, heck, the journey from Darnassus to Ironforge/Stormwind is *even worse* than the journey from Thunderbluff to Orgrimmar and yet I'd STILL see justification in selling ports to and from Thunderbluff.
---
But ports to Orgrimmar from Undercity? That's insane, who'd actually pay for that?
---
Try whispering people.  Its how I formed 95% of my groups.  Also added good people from those PUGs to my friends list so I had an easier list for when I hit 60.  Can't think of any group that took longer than 5-10mins to form.  Hell I formed an MC PUG in about an hour and a half a couple of weeks ago.
---
They did. it was called dynamic spawning. Check it out. And it still wasn't enough.
---
He also says that everyone rolled need anyway so there was no need to do that. 
---
So seems to me like you lot didn't read his side and instantly jumped to condemn him anyway. 
---
This sub has just showed how much people can be complete assholes in a situation like this. Especially the guy that got so aggrieved he went out of his way to cause as much trouble as possible after giving zero benefit of the doubt.
---
But they will be again, when the states will ban or tax with 80% the MTX that are gambling-like features.
---
It is coming, because there are billions made on a monthly basis by MTX, and the states already eyeing this either as being illegal (EU states mostly) or being an income generator trough taxing (US, Aus, China).
---
This is terrible advice, the best thing you can do against a warrior as a rogue is use evasion immediately before he is able to apply hamstring or rend to you.
---
Yeah it is the same, but that's actually not the issue. It's literally removing the nightfin soup buff. Not sure what is up with it. Was happening in my entire raid.
---
What does numlock do?
---
It takes a spot inbetween I would argue.  
---
I play \~2h a day and I am lvl 42. You can archieve more in a shorter time frame on retail (leveling and welfare gear) but if you want to raid the highest dificult (retail = mythic / classic = has only one raidtier) you cant do that in retail casualy but you could do that in classic once you are 60.  
---
BiS gear is easier to get aswell once you are 60 since there is no mythic+ warforged, titanforged etc.
---
Took herb/alch since I thought pots/elixirs would help me level more than skinning. But I'll keep it in mind for my druid alt. Thanks.
---
or maybe not if layers get removed and there are still 10k + people its a gamble ^^
---
Ah yea, also very easy to take the humble position immediately, apologize, and rectify the situation.
---
Wish there was one to make night time darker :/

That’s a truly pathetic attitude.
---
1) If someone is rude to you, it doesn’t justify you being rude to someone entirely different
---
2) People are under no obligation to group with you, slowing their levelling to boost yours
---
3) If you cant complete a quest because the area is busy, try a different time of day or do another quest (I personally have started doing my questing in the morning before work and then just sticking to dungeons etc. in the evening when it’s busy)
---
As a healer in lower level dungeons, up till SM so far and I don't really care who tanks. Sometimes we even go for 4 DPS since the tank isn't needed.
---
God bless autorun
---
The guards might try...
---
haha oh yes, or a R1 frostbolt for the laughs. you can literally see them panic sometimes and it makes me chuckle like the giant nerd I am.
---
You dont need evidence to prove your point. I understand what you are saying. I was having a totally different argument. Was based on the first guys post think and yes, totally hard headed on numbers.
---
Will definately give it a try, thanks!
---
If you're getting 30-40k xp/hr with spellcleave at 35+ you're doing it wrong and I hope you stop giving advice to other people lol.
---
If everyone needed then it ain't ninja, it's just fuckin spastic crybabies whinging because they didn't get it. Death threats and told to commit suicide over some pixels... If you reading this are one of those that think these kind of messages are OK, then you're nothing but an Internet warrior no balled cancer of a person.
---
This is not an issue, this is like an extra dlc except you get it for free
---
I'll do as I please, thank you.
---
You neatly pushed need and greed into a single term, roll. This is about needing or greeding, not about passing or rolling.
---
ALL i see is 10 to 12 gold.
---
Love shaman. What is the firespell you cast that looks like a magma totem.
---
Conpared to a mage/lock/rogue.... sure thing
---
Don't you have phones!?
---
Not sure, people seem very surprised to hear were a guild of English speakers on the korean server. You need a korean ID to make an account
---
MC as a mage you press exactly one button. 
---
Even on pserver with significantly more difficult raids, Jinthalor and other open world dungeons were harder than content up until early AQ40 playerskill wise.
---
What I'm talking about is 5men content with crappy geared players. 
---
Try it yourself to clear a dungeon in a timely manner if you warlock (another spell cleave class) has not learned shadowbolt and tell me how its going if your DPS puts up 3 dots and then WANDS.
---
I don't really like new games, I am sure there will be a gem between all the chaff sometimes, but I have no time to find those and no need for it.  I am not 20 anymore and spend less time gaming in general.  I like the 2000-2010 era in gaming best and there are more titles from only that period than I can play in my lifetime, so I would still be happy if nothing new came out ever again.
---
I do think that games in general have gotten worse, because it's more marketing and less game design.
---
"It was a blue BoE but everyone needed in the end because of AH/vendor money towards mount."
---
Everybody needed. They got upset because they didn't win and decided to take it out on this guy. Nothing about this was unfair yet some nasty little prick went on a crusade anyway. 
---
This sub is also being judgemental assholes, jumping to conclusions and not actually reading the full situation before slamming the guy. 
---
Stop being a dick.
---
Thanks man!
---
Remove (or improve) walking, increase droprates, decrease downtimes and fix meme specs, and you will get retail wow with less content.
---
Hey hey people. Since the BRD Torch farm got absolutely obliterated by our overlord, is there any other efficient xp farming method beside trash in BRD, UBRD, LBRD, Strat? I'm 53 and want to get to 60 as fast as possible
---
Its already ruined the economy
---
2ms Ping by the way in Seoul 😂
---
If they’re running an spellcleave group and advertising it as such, they’d be entirely justified not inviting you if you aren’t one of the classes that fit that comp.
---
There are tonnes of people running other groups still. I’ve seen plenty of melee cleave groups too. Mages currently only make up 14% of the toons on classic.
---
I’ve yet to see an alliance get brutally ganked on Stalaag as Horde. It’s funny too because there was a gank squad going around Felwood Sunday and a bunch of alliance killing people at Booty Bay and the boat. 
---
Sucks all the alliance decided to dip :( I have yet to notice the imbalance
---
  **&lt;Rising&gt;**
---
**Basic Information**
---
Server: Firemaw (EU PvP)
---
Guild Type: Semi Hardcore Raiding
---
Raid Nights: Monday, Thursday and Sunday
---
Raid Times: 8:30pm to 11:30pm CET
---
**About us**
---
The main focus of our guild is our community. We prioritise building and maintaining a community of friendly players that are willing to support their guildmates above all else. We believe that having a group of supportive players is a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play and that ultimately having a friendly group of players at hand will ensure we all get the most enjoyment out of the game.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
Although we do not have an age requirement as such, we are an adult guild. The majority of our guild are 25/30+ so should you wish to apply please take that into consideration.
---
**Raiding**
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 23:30 CET for progression raids, although we do not expect we usually will need all 3 days to clear available content (particularly during early phases)
---
If you do sign up, we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is fairly young, we have filled the majority of our raiding roster. We do still have some spaces available and our needs for each class can be found on our website. However, if you see your class listed as low priority or even closed, we are always open for exceptional candidates so feel free to still apply.
---
For loot we're adopting a fair and transparent Loot Council system for raiding with a management team that’s been running raiding guilds for nearly 15 years.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this will be much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. A lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid capital cities. There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members, so I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, willing to help their fellow guildies and be able to have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up on time and so on. If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website https://rising.shivtr.red/. You will need to let us know a little about yourself to ensure that we share the same values. If you have any additional questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord @Boo#0059, @GlenCoco#3702, or @QFierced#7447.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
I do, but I dont have the same problem. Have you tried the usual, streching and standing while working or is the problem more related to looking at the screen too much?
---
Maybe look into adjusting your screen settings, brightness and whatnot?
---
They needed because he needed first, obviously.
---
That’s the same on my server. I think you missed the point at the very start when I said “this isn’t a one trick, do this one thing kinda guide” there just a bunch of things to bare in mind with the way you play whilst you level. 
---
Un’Goro last night for almost one whole level, I got 3 Devilsaur leather, and about 4 stacks of rugged and 5 stacks of thick. That’s just skinning.
---
There's a point between pulling 2 mobs at a time and CCing one of them and a mage pulling the entire dungeon then wiping. If you're a tank and pull incredibly slow then you're wasting peoples time, same as a mage pulling everything and wiping. Not everything is black and white
---
Thanks. I'll look into this.

Candy Crush is not a subscription-based MMORPG on a PC platform. You are comparing apples with bricks here.

British Petrolium makes more money than all games on all platforms combined.
---
Another example that have nothing to do with what we are talking about, which is subscription based MMORPGs on a PC platform.
---
Oh, thanks for the tip. That would have saved me some trouble.
---
By default, it makes your character run automatically. The key next to numlock (/) makes it so your char walks instead of running.
---
The day this happens.. hell with freeze over. Literally what goes through ever tanks mind during classic. As a tank good read.
---
Yeah I don't even try to group up that way. Just play normally questing or farming what you need and keep an eye on LFG channel.
---
LOLURJUSTBADUNINSTALLWOWNOOBIWATCHEDTHREESTREAMERSDOTHATEZ!!!!!!
---
Exactly how it went down in Tanaris last night.
---
Alliance and Horde questing peacefully in the pirate area for over an hour.  Then a group of alliance roll in and gank people in the outlying areas(out of sight of most people).
---
The bloodbath began when a Horde ran in with fear on him, right into the middle of a group of horde killing pirates.  It started by killing the ganking team.  However, soon the innocent questing alliance were caught in the crosshairs.  After this, the alliance were not seen for a few hours.
---
What about oceanic servers?
---
That’s really strange. Just tried it by myself on my shammy and didn’t have an issue. There was a blue post mentioning strange things happening like your innate hit chance counting as an “aura” and pushing other buffs off your character. Perhaps that’s the issue in raid? Idk
---
Num Lock is a stupid bind for something you constantly click. At least I do.
---
Show me where i said "hunters are the most common class" rip
---
FFXIV compared to...what? Retail? Sure. Classic? Nope.
---
In Vanilla you could click the stones (or talk to an inn keeper) and you would be put in some kind of LFG queue that would assemble a group of players that did the same (click meeting stone or talk to inn keeper). However almost nobody used it because it was awful. You could end up with a group of 5 warriors, it basically just put any 5 people together no matter their class.
---
This guy is being an ass. Any Arms warrior knows you MS on CD when you can. Charge and an auto doesn't let you MS. This guy is just taking the piss.
---
Yooo this is also how you get on top of the AH balcony in SW Trade district. Such nostalgia :')
---
im bored already.. LOL !!!
---
The elite quest seems to give wotlk rep 350 instead of vanilla rep 50. Bug reported.
---
They didn't. Named mobs still take 5 min to respawn
---
Did you not read the blue post from Lore regarding the situation? Esfand's case had nothing to do with layering, and they were told by a GM to proceed with the raid.
---
Cheers, also For The Horde! // Karraph &lt;SKÅL&gt;

---
That's a Questie bug. Nothing to do with acutal WoW
---
Orcs have the added bonus damage on pets, and Cannibalize can be useful in combination with Life Tap. Every humanoid corpse becomes a mana recharge.
---
I think it really comes down to looks. Btw there are more undead warlocks than orc warlocks, if that influences your decision.
---
Not what I asked. If the tank is pulling slow it's because they're uncomfortable pulling more. You as a mage have a responsibility to make it easier on them either via CC or by not taking aggro. If you want faster pulls, roll a tank and shut up.
---
That post! Holy shit the Nostalgia.
---
I almost convinced my brother to get an owl while we level, but he chickened out because "we play horde" and "it's a fuken suicide mission"
---
Congrats man! The silver lining is the less hours you have to play because of work, the more you'll enjoy the hours you do have on WoW!
---
What do they expect? You play on a PVP server and stream. Don't cry like a baby when you get sniped
---
&gt; the fact that I need an add-on to see how much quest rewards are worth.
---
Thinking for yourself combined with experience will help with that over time, don't worry. Except if you are using an addon and not giving it any thought whatsoever of course. 
---
&gt; My only complaints are the nameplate distance 
---
Aye, that one should be modifiable in the settings somehow.
---
Horses for courses. I think AoE runs are much more fun because there’s more risk of wipe 😂 You have to really concentrate.
---
Single-pack pulls is a very slow, safe way of completing a dungeon. 
---
I don’t disparage those that prefer that, they’re welcome to do it that way but they’re not my preference.
---
In my opinion, the best way is to do something with a group, like a dungeon or some quests and check what guild the people you like are in. Just ask of they can invite you and you are set!
---
Are you Dutch and on Golemagg EU by any chance?
---
No, this is actually useful.
---
I used to play tbc but on a very casual level and I don't have any experience with raid/high level dungeons, I need to learn these things.
---
If you don’t link it in /gchat, did it even drop?
---
Go to your servers Reddit or discord channel and look for recruitment posts. Raid times, goals and other information will be described and pick one that fits you

This would be 3 rows, no?

Just don't reply if you don't feel like it. Or just say I am bussy. If this all faills after some tries just give it straight.

Unless you don't want to interact with this person at all. Then just go for the ignore.
---
The tank isn't the leader of the group. If your tank is dogshit your group has the same amount of reason to kick him than anyone else wasting the groups time, just because they're a tank doesn't mean they have some sort of right to bring everyone down
---
Ok, how exactly does it work? My friend has inputted an old code I had lying around and he still can’t access the game.
---
Firemaw-eu here. 3500 in queue last night. About 1-1.5 hr waiting.
---
Are you daft? Berserker rage costs no rage. It literally does not affect your ability to Mortal Strike in any way, shape, or form. You can Charge &gt; Zerker &gt; Zerker Rage &gt; Battle Stance &gt; Auto all before you even have 30 rage. What is your problem?
---
Does fire resistance lower the self damage a warlock takes from hellfire?

Yeah I second this, if I get a decent run with a guild group I'll make sure to ask how active the guild is and to make sure there's people around my level and if the run is good I'll ask to join.
---
This is amazing
---
this works perfectly for me, thank you! I guess I was overcomplicating my macro
---
Time to reroll
---
Can someone please help me with a macro? I’d really appreciate it. 
---
I’m trying to use iron grenade and have my pet stop attacking (because it instantly breaks the stun).
---
If possible I’d prefer it to still allow me to act as if I’d just clicked the grenade but haven’t chosen the location yet. Hope this is all clear. 
---
So you have a Delay when pushing buttons? Cause that’s what always happens to me when I plug my notebook to the TV
---
I was in the same boat (L20 new wow player) and did one message in chat at Orgrimmar, got a /w saying:
---
“Heard you’re looking for a guild
---
So do you wanna be a marine?
---
A moist marine?”
---
I was sold. New member of the Moist Marines.
---
I guess not mate. You're legitimately the first person to say they can farm even 50g in BRD in Classic because of RNG Warden spawns who net, limiting what rooms you can pull. Also RNG Fire mobs in the only portions of the dungeon without Wardens. I'm assuming you're not talking about private servers where it was different. There's no videos on BRD either, so feel free to educate :)
---
Just make mobs in specific places able to teleport to you if they can't path.
---
Surgical, Precise, no extra mobs or walls. Least impact. Job done.
---
Aye I never understood that issue. Did people seriously use "LFG DM" for finding Dire Maul groups without specifying which part they would want to run? People really can baffle me sometimes.
---
Just ordered a wireless keyboard and mouse on Prime.
---
why lvl as seal of fate? If you wanna pvp go deep subtley? litterrally unkillable
---
He did get the item though. I think the rationally here is that if he had pressed last, he would have ninja'd, because everyone else pressed greed already. Additionally, I bet one or two people had pressed before him.
---
He was playing with a kid and pressed need first of his whole party? I feel like we might not be getting the whole story here.
---
Take the L bro
---
&gt;Lol who can take 16 hours out of the only non-work days in their schedule consistently for a month?
---
People in their 20s and early 30s or people with no kids
---
Blizzard says they have the referance client and its how it should be....  
---
So not sure who to believe...
---
It seems the elite quest currently gives 350 rep making this grind a joke. Should be far less. Bug reported.
---
Very hard to do on a warlock. The reason it’s so easy for mages is frost and blink.
---
&gt; The tank isn't the leader of the group
---
Wrong.
---
&gt; If your tank is dogshit
---
Not pulling packs doesn't make them dogshit.
---
&gt; just because they're a tank
---
It means they have the authority to pull the instance how they want, now make me some water.
---
The journey of fighting mobs for 2% quest drops that your need ten of, as you have to fight more of your own faction for kills than an enemy, and you spend more time finding the monster or waiting for it to respawn than you do actually fighting it.  
---
People want the destination because the journey is a chore.
---
I’m on a high/full server lol. This thread is full of people both telling me opposite things
---
This’ll only work on a low pop server!
---
This’ll only work on a high pop server!

Outside of Uldaman there's quest to find a chest in the "North Common Hall", which just happens to be south of the "South Common Hall".
---
I won’t ever touch retail again until they get rid of flying mounts and RNG lootbox-like mechanics such as azerite.
---
I got annoyed just reading this
---
This depends on the healer actually putting pts into their healing tree. As a feral druid I absolutely need to meet the level requirement to heal a dungeon. I would want to see proof the under-levelled healer isn't really a shadow priest or kitty before inviting them.
---
Seems to be alliance warlocks and their Paladin buddy with a 5-8 level advantage on me who get a hard on wiping me off the face of the earth
---
"Bu...but muh meta dps class!!!"
---
I’m sorry..
---
You should see my undead in mage pre-bis gear, you could easily mistake me for someone who’s lvl 22
---
You mean flamelash ?
---
And here I am at lvl 25..
---
Well if you roll on a item you clearly cant use, or inst even consider good for you spec, you will get negative attention.Do this multiple times and i'm sure you wont be invited to that raid group anymore... because its a dick move
---
I don’t have any screen capture myself but let me see if I can find a video of the run I mean. I’ll post it here.
---
What is the best dagger build for leveling? I got a gutripper and I want to try out daggers. I admit swords is likely superior but it might be fun to ambush people for world pvp. I am interesting in a fun dagger build for leveling that leaves me options open for PVP. I have played sword rogue in vanilla and I think it is better but I want to test something out that might be fun.
---
I replied about this. You can give specific guards the ability to teleport to a target they can't path to.
---
Surgically solves the job.
---
Nope
---
I went in blind because the guild I'd had lined up since Blizzcon 17 fell apart a couple weeks before launch. I (pretty much, had to turn down several obvious bad choices) got picked up by a decent guild while farming pre raid bis by being a social guy and letting my gameplay speak for itself. That tactic might be a fair bit harder if you play dps though, it can be way harder to gauge people in that role.
---
Meh I could care less, just kill them or move on.
---
Mothers milk is cancer. Never let anyone do that quest in a pug. Only time i tried ejrhbmt group same thing happened to us. We wiped on same trash top of stairs before the gun guy boss. We all had the poison tho which we all agreed to keep and try to finish the dungeon anyway. It was Kindof funny because we all were to blame being greedy. Sorry your healer was a dick.
---
Try

/Cast !iron granade
---
Don't have any experience with pet macros.
---
They drop relativly valuable greys (the more valuable one 45s per stack) 
---
Have a chance of a golden pearl (around 10g on my Server) or other sorts of pearls.
---
The skinning part thick leather + the turtle scales they sell for around 15-20s per piece on my server.
---
Someone asked me about how much they’re worth. So I answered the question. I haven’t even sold my bags, I use them as I’d suggest anyone else to, so I don’t really see your point. Just transfer off your awful server if it’s that bad lol
---
Post ur server and wait for the replies
---
MC Hammer would like a word with you
---
I would be squinting at the text. I guess you could always bump up UI scale I suppose.
---
That's my biggest problem with it actually. I change my mind of what I want to play so often. I'm on my warrior and I see a shaman running around throwing down totems and I want to play a shaman. But as someone with limited time to game I don't want to make a new character and do the 1-20 experience again because I also want to see what lvl 40+  is like and experience those dungeons and zones.
---
That sounds like rambling. I guess what I am saying is  I do like the difficulty and rewarding feeling of classic. But the fact I feel forced into a certain playstyle for a lot of hours to experience it all is a bit of a downside for me. It can get pretty onedimensional.
---
Amazing. I've seen that guild on my server and I've seen a player with your very same name.
---
My advice get an auctioneer type add-on. They scan the auction house and lets you know the average of what it's seen an item being auctioned for. Doing that will keep you from vendoring things like elemental fire for 4s instead of putting it on the AH for 50s. You don't have to use it ever if you don't want to, but your basically just missing out on easy money.
---
Thanks mate! No stop in sight!
---
Write a macro that equips your dagger for the ability’s you need and another for switching back to the sword
---
I can't wait to charge others for using my aspect of the bast on them! I paid for it just so their ungrateful asses could move faster!!!  
---
^(obvious /s)
---
Me too... By work not by wow
---
ABS works for me, so not sure what you did wrong on that one.
---
That sounds highly unlikley then. I really have no idea besides the usual, deleting cache and reinstalling addons fresh. But I assume you e tried those. I do hope you figure it out!
---
I did not add any new skill nor level an  existing skill since level 20 because I enacted a "Mount First" policy :)
---
Just yesterday I was ganged twice by a shaman and I am pretty sure I could have won both times if I only had execute (lvl 37 warrior) but that would cost almost 1g to learn!
---
I rather bite the dust a few times more than neccessary and get my Mount before i level up to 41 :)
---
Thats the correct answer if DPS ask if they will find a spot as a most played class.
---
You will *always* find a raiding spot as long as you are a good player.
---
Be below average, slack and play a highly played class? You gonna have a bad time.
---
[https://i.redd.it/pz8ia81nh3n31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/pz8ia81nh3n31.jpg) \- problem solved  :) Just don't try this with King Mosh...
---
Weird how this applies to just about *any* team based game. At the least, Overwatch comes to mind. The kind of people that don't do this stuff naturally (because they already see that it is in their best interest) are the same kind of people that cause traffic jams.
---
And this is the key word, which proves that close to 8 million players were at Classic launch.
---
3.4 mil x $50 = $175 million.
---
3.4 mil subs x 223% = 7.5 million WoW players
---
7.5 mil x $15 = $120 million.
---
Thing is, when Classic launched, most likely BfA player base was way under 2 million players, which basically means that returning WoW players for Classic were more than 6 million, and BfA around 1.5 million.
---
As predicted by the "crazy people", Classic was 4 times as big as Retail, at launch, and even if he loses half their players (which doesn't even look to be the case), it will still be TWICE as big as Retail.
---
And when Classic goes Classic+, which always was inevitable, Retail will be, just like RS3, a 1/5th or maybe a 1/4th of Classic+ player base.
---
Retail will still generate more money, but it won't be an MMORPG. It will be what it is now, and even worse that that : a single player casino game.
---
Ok, asshole.
---
Shazrah has like 1-2h also on eves
---
Great question, I would like to know too
---
I did test it today, the guy just gets gnomed on the mount :(
---
The dungeons are called BRD,UBRS,LBRS(Black Rock spire)
---
Looks like he's on the Arathi Highlands side of the gate to Hillsbrad.
---
i mean yes and no, new ranks of heals do make a pretty big diff.  An example: paladin healing before level 20 is a pain in the arse because you only have the mana-inefficient holy light.  At level 20 you get flash of light and it's night and day.
---
Later on again, healing is usually a lot easier in the 2-3 levels just after getting a new rank of your mana efficient heal too.
---
It’s probs doable if you’re a little over leveled, I’d guess 53+ it’d work. We were 48-50 so slightly under leveled for BRD with only 1 mage for AoE.
---
Right? It's like giving fortitude to others as a priest. I love doing it every chance i get, i even chase people to buff them. It costs me nothing but mana which regenerates fast (i love spirit) and it makes their lives easier so idk man... some people are brain dead.
---
Depends on the mob. Cats and shit are too fast. Humanoids are pretty easy.
---
Don't spam moonfire on a rooted target. Damage has a chance to break the root.
---
I would be so here to tune up damage.
---
I have never had a fair fight against Horde on Stalagg. They routinely use their numbers advantage to gank and swarm. 
---
When you get to end game, it becomes even more apparent and worse. 
---
If a mob is profitable to farm, don’t bother going as Alliance. They’ll be 2 Horde farming a team, and if you beat them, 2 more Horde show up so they can win.
---
Mage here, level 29. Im very chill when playing and in a dungeon, ask the tank if he would like me to AOE or not. Im content to equally just use my utility, slows/roots/polymorph and single target things down. 
---
It's not worth trying to pull off the tank, and I am very happy doing whatever to see the job done.
---
19,000 of them unsubed.
---
The problem is that most levelers are at 35-50 currently, therefore they don't know any better regarding high level dungeons. Tell me how AoEing the officer + medic + footmen groups in front of Baelgar goes for you.
---
Oh I just realized that this robe is mage only. I didn't understand why anyone would be stupid enough to get robe of the void when this exists. Yea they just love mages it seems. 
---
For warlocks i think the winter night or something is better to go for. Rotv is too much hassle.
---
The level 50 quests come in a later phase. If you look up the quest on classic wowhead it should say what phase it will be in.
---
A wise man once said: There are no Chicks with Dicks, only guys with tits.
---
But I'm into it so i don't judge lol
---
Best read I've had in a while - thank you!
---
And secondly, this thread has been a rollercoaster of emotions of what the hell of a class I _really_ want to play. The altoholism kicks in...
---
Rouges always make me see red.
---
Please reflect what you are actually doing now in those ‘productive’ hours. Would be curious to hear
---
Mobs in dungeons don’t really do enough damage to threaten me from taking aggro on one. If I see I’m going to die I’ll vanish (I suppose you could ice block, feign death etc.) Tanks that get stressed they don’t have every mob in every situation like they MUST keep you alive are generally not the best tanks
---
Only use it for materials and bags 
---
Nothing else is worth risking the deposit at this stage of the servers progression of wealth
---
In vanilla I mained a priest and one of the warriors in my guild would 2h/zerker tank as arms and it worked great. I had to pay a bit more attention to the game but it wasn’t that hard to heal and the pace was fun.
---
Cleave Groups are more efficient if you‘re knowing what you‘re doing. I think you should play whatever you like to play and as you like to play.  But no doubt spell cleaves are more effective and efficient. I do ZF runs with spell cleaves with around 100k exp a hour. There is no way you would achieve that with a normal setup.
---
Dang, that is super tempting...
---
What does dr damage do? :)
---
Arms warriors have a talent that makes overpower an automatic crit that applies a bleed.
---
For me when I am leveling I think of a few things. How much damage can I do and how can I mitigate damage. I usually don't garrote or use rupture at all. I always open with cheap shot, it gives me time of unfettered damage and instant 2 combo points. I immediately slice and dice after this then use SS, I usually prioritize keeping slice and dice up over eviscerate at this point. If I deem that my eviscerate would overkill them, I try to get a maximum combo point Slice and dice to take into the next mob. I find garrote and rupture to be less useful to me. I might opt to use kidney shot as well to take less damage. I am also open to the fact that this might not be optimal. However, I am getting around 18-20k an hour on titan panel. I do make a point to ask mages for food before I go leveling. I think keeping up slice and dice up at all costs and minimizing the time that the mob can retaliate is better than DoT damage. I honestly haven't tried rupture that much though.
---
Yeah, as an ex-devilsaur hunter, this image made me want to tip OP 1g for the spot
---
Yes those cloth wearing paladins look mighty indeed
---
Thank you for your kind words, but am so unemployed by nature. Now when I start working I wont be playing or haveing a social life and its fucked up, I just dont have the energy. Only "silver line" is that its a few months job.
---
Is AAAAA Better or OOOOO? The world may never know.
---
Bringing DPS to the table allows quicker instance clean. On previous dungeons I did, I usually end up with 8 to 9% of the total damage done by the group.
---
Yup, though I’ve had to set up a macro to tell my party ‘Fuck sake, baby woken up, gonna have to brb, don’t pull any more. Sorry, shouldn’t be long.’ 
---
He hasn’t done it while I’m healing a boss fight. Yet.
---
Specs were mostly seen as useless back then because everybody was new to this. You had to min/max to progress easily.
---
This time around, the raids are fairly trivial. Anyone should be able to get into any raid as any spec. The only time we might see this not be the case is for Naxx. Naxx will be a legitimate challenge for many people. And maybe AQ40.
---
ALWAYS look at what you can buy at the AH mats wise and see if you can flip it via profession!
---
Hell, even with First Aid you can buy stacks of silk and make bandages for 20c-50c profit per bandage when vendoring.
---
Hahaha
---
Man.. I thought I spoiled myself when after seeing the classic announcement I went and picked up a new desktop (rtx2080, i7-7900k, 32gb ram) that will run any current title flawlessly. I had a computer that would barely run wow when I played in vanilla in high school so I decided to go all out on a new rig for launch this time around.
---
But a freakin house? That's some next level shot right there.
---
It is
---
Thank you I will have to try this at home
---
If you have the official release from curse, its not been updated for a while and doesn't work for classic. For a working version, you're looking for https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24958-AuctionatorClassicquickfix.html
---
It's pvp not a duel
---
Okay grandpa. 
---
Let me throw up a sheep, run to the AH, post some greens, buy some mats, craft some bags, and maybe when I’m done with all that - you’ll finally be ready with enough threat generation for AoE clearing on 3 mobs.
---
It may be, but it also explains why people mostly hate mages.  No one said it was rational - but there is a reason.
---
I know the feeling but don't feel bad bro!
---
I'll blame others for instantly jumping to condemn him rather than being a reasonable human because that's just a dick move. This sub seems very quick to jump on people tbh. I think they just like being judgemental and superior.
---
That's exactly the problem I'm talking about. People get to 60 and have no idea what they are doing, because they AoE cleaved their way to 60.
---
Tell me again in what universe a wand is as good as shadowbolting stuff to death in a dungeon in which dots dont tick long enough to be even worth their mana.
---
Someone did this to my server 2 days ago, but 10 minutes into the slaughter it vanished into thin air, not sure if it glitches or a GM deleted it or something.
---
... Have you ever read the skill description? It says it decreases happiness by 50.
---
But the guide says Horde has stronger PvP racials!
---
With the right talents (discipline) and a proper wand, your wand does more damage and more often than your smite.
---
Saving half your mana bar + proccing the regen when the mob dies (shadow talent) will allow you to have barely any downtime
---
Nobody was giving advice and I’m not doing it wrong 30-40k xp/hour is actually really good stop being a moron. Hop off my nuts go somewhere else with your misery
---
Thanks for advices ! One more question - what build should i do first ? For example i have no idea if i should even use hamstring in early leveling. Every skill sounds useful for now, and i dont want to mess something up.
---
Retail ain’t bad it’s just that I played it way too long so I won’t touch it till next expansion
---
In 1.12 itemization, yes. But I believe (I could be wrong, my guild's taking *forever* to start raiding so I haven't seen this personally) rogues and mages will still rock dps charts until BWL.
---
Making my down town...
---
Same. Now I gank everything that’s red. I don’t care if it’s way below my level. 
---
I also really hate rogues so I am definitely not letting those guys go. Charge, Rend, hamstring and wreck them. If I see a rogue I know they will definitely try to gank, I guess that’s the kind of people the class attracts. I had many situations where I would see a rogue my level struggle with mobs and I will let him live only for him to patch up and then sneak up on me when I am fighting mobs later. So now all rogues die for sure.
---
WARNING you will get banned.

I've been playing as a Shaman Tank for +8years. Shaman Tanking in Classic is more possible than ever. To give you a perspective/idea I managed to get until the Naxxramas raid on a private server (pservers are considered harder than Classic). By no means is tanking easy, so here's a Shaman Tank guide to help you: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
---
In my experience, as the warrior, once you get overpowered two or three times (which is wholly realistic in the term of the fight) the fight is over. A proper geared warrior will take 1/4 to 1/3 of a similar geared rogue per overpower crit, and take surprisingly little damage in return.
---
Ah. I haven't had that experience myself.
---
You're drawing false equivalencies here. A death threat without intent is nothing, discardable. Nobody feels fear when recieving one from a random stranger in a game, knowing what the reason is they received it on the first place. Murder is obviously not the same as a whisper in WoW. He will be forgotten tomorrow. Don't exaggerate.
---
As a healer, I’m more frustrated by the people who get used to big swag aoe pulls and don’t realize we can’t do them when our tank is a feral druid and our dps consists of 2 rogues and a hunter.
---
Should be easy to try with a resistance aura/totem.
---
Well.. Enemy castbars + you never kick before 0.2 sec before it is fully casted. So no, should not happen.

I walked my ass out there at level 29 as Horde and grinded them to level 31. Took a few hours but I watched some movies while doing it. Got 2 pet drops which is super lucky. I was only expecting 1 tops. But I did this for the pet gold for my mount, not for the exp.
---
What the hell wedon't have the whole story as far as i read it he instant needed on the item
---
&gt; everyone needed **in the end** 
---
Without a detailed rundown who needed when and what chat followed after that its normal not to trust what OP says.
---
Also...
---
&gt; You are acting like a total dick. Fucking stop it. 
---
What is wrong with you...
---
classic means reading quest texts or grinding, questie and the like are against the spirit of classic imho
---
I also had to do this
---
What’s this place called again?
---
good point, just healing it is.
---
That has nothing to do with it, why would you kick a mage randomly? If a tank is bad you can just pull out the LFG addon or channel, find a new one and you're good to go. It's not like there's any shortage of them either.
---
Amazing ability to gather up six of your best mates and go stomp someone not giving you the time of day. Excellent PvP experience.
---
There's also a spot in front of the blacksmiths in Gadg which is on the floor but just out of range of patrolling guards. It will be interesting to see what Blizz do about that since you can stand there freecasting and unless someone is standing exactly on top of you they can't touch you without being killed by the guards.
---
Very OP being a priest in any of these zones - mind control your target and watch the guards bum rush them.
---
I don't think there's any class a rogue can't kill with preparation and a marginally cheaper cheap shot. Subtelity is great at 1v1 world pvp and it's loads of fun. Couple these with get out of tangle Sprint and you're epic and golden.
---
I'm also puzzeled at why people are rushing to 60. Don't they realize it's a barren wasteland at the moment?
---
I am 28lvl and I have yet to experience the whole "forced to interact with players". Sure there was occasional grouping for some quests but that was to save everybody's time not because we couldn't do it without the others. So far I have soloed every elite quest/hard to solo quest I have come across. Even if you want just help someone struggling with an elite mob you can just attack the mob, no interaction with the player.
---
I am either misunderstanding what people mean by "forced to interact" or it's just another illusion about Classic...
---
The devilsaur looks really happy!
---
I never got in trouble for it.
---
sure I didnt do it 24/7 but I did stand on the silithus arch a lot and did kill people.
---
That's a big bummer but you're right, better not risk it.
---
ic, i dono whenever i did pvp so far i dident shift to often as it eats up your mana realy fast since you typicly dont run around with int gear all over the place.
---
Np, I was playing wotlk and tbc pserver through the years.
---
You can always tell who's gonna do it.
---
3 people running around together avoiding anyone who's their level
---
And then swarm someone on their own and spam /spit etc
---
Always terrible aswel and usually still struggle
---
Children, chores, wife, sleep, trainings... Im lvl 26 dont have time to play at all fuck.
---
Exactly what i needed! Thanks
---
If you "accidentally" click need and it's BOE, manually roll and give it to someone. Otherwise you're just ninja and may enjoy your ruined reputation
---
you missed a lot of fucking good wow in 11 years
---
Then those someones get angry and they counter gank with X buddies and then you get hillsbrad/stv mayhem. Yea that's pvp, duels are 1v1. Get off your high horse salt boy
---
When you think about it, mages are the most "retail" of wow classic's classes.
---
What are the fundamental issues with wow classic that make it grindier and less newb friendly than retail?  The world is huge and it takes a long time to get anywhere, you're constantly low on money because you need to buy food/bandages etc, and leveling is pretty slow.  
---
Mages are the only class that have none of these problems due to teleport and being able to make their own food/drink for free.  This and they also happen to be the fastest levelers in the game.
---
Therefore I conclude: Mage is the class for retail players who want to play classic but not really.
---
You are a negative person. I hope you find happiness one day.
---
If you're a mage or a priest, trash farming in LBRS is so efficient is ridiculous.
---
As a member of &lt;And the Boiz&gt; this is too true.
---
&gt;  why would you kick a mage randomly?
---
Hmm, I dunno maybe because
---
&gt; there's nothing wrong with pulling an additional pack
---
This causes wipes?? You're slowing the group down by being stupid and in the process showing why you deserve to be replaced.
---
Exactly, as a priest i had a mage like that in my group and i let him die twice. I'm not jeopardizing the group by wasting my mana on a DPS that overpulls and overaggros. My priority is always the tank. If i can save you, and also keep the tank up, i will but if you pull more so you can AOE you can be certain i'm going to laugh as you run around in panic hoping for a heal that never comes. Know your place in the group.
---
Until Scholo, Strat and BRD there is simply no need for a shield with at least a semi-competent healer
---
The Questing part was always the mist boring  part for me. I really prechiate the questing in rametsil to be honest.
---
Hey! Good on you for starting, it is a great game overall! I've been reliving the experience again since vanilla, so I'm really happy right now and I'll try to answer some of your questions, but bear in mind they are my opinion and not actual facts. :)
---
1. The beginning of each character does not seem slow, this game manages the feeling of hitting max level really well, meaning you feel like you really have to work to get there, and you actually will have to work to get there, regardless of class. Believe you me there will be times you'll be frustrated with how slow things are going, but it makes it more rewarding in the end. As for warrior, I think the reason people label warrior as a slow leveling class is that the solo curve for warriors is a bit steeper, and mistakes a little less forgiving. A hunter or rogue could get away easier from a misspull, but a warrior would maybe die, which adds to total time played. Add the aspect that a warrior has a bit tougher time overall to solo content, and that is why I think people call it slower. Is it MUCH slower? I don't think so at all, but opinions might differ.
---
2. I'd say sell everything you can't immediately use or need for quests. Maybe later you'll need some items for professions or such, but those probably come cheap and if you haven't saved them you can probably buy them cheap anyway.
---
3. Good!
---
4. Hmmm, a bit of this is personal preference, and the obviously being protection is for mid- and end-game tanking, sacrificing some damage in the process. That said most people tend to use arms/fury to speed up the leveling, bearing in mind that a respec starts at 1g and increases every time you respec (though I don't know if there's a cap).
---
5. See 4.
---
6. You could, I haven't tried it in classic and honestly I don't like it that much. You could use it as an escape or to survive larger pulls, but as you've said, there seems to be some discussion about the effectiveness at the moment, but I'm a bit out of the loop on that one, so maybe click around a bit.
---
7. To craft items you have to pick (and level) the corresponding profession. Say you want to craft armor, you have to take the profession, start finding/buying recipes and crafting simple stuff to level your skill, rinse and repeat for more/better/higher rarity items. 
---
8. This is also personal. To help yourself in the mid- to end-game you could say blacksmithing or enchanting could be useful. Keep in mind that most professions are not used for self-service, but for making money later in the game. Sure you can craft your own armor or enchant your own gear, but the majority of the time you'll be using these to make money to buy the things you need from other professions in my opinion. Obviously some make more money than others, some cost more time as investment as well, or are easier to level, but I'll leave you to research and decide. Basically there's no need to pick some that suits your character, but one that suits *you.* You can always learn a skill later, but keep in mind you can only have two at a time. Easy ones to use and level while you are leveling your character though are things like skinning, herbalism and mining, which can be done one the go and also gives you a nice amount of starting pocket money! :)
---
9. There are tons to be honest. It depends on what you want, do you want fast effective leveling without too much lore? Or the best for making money/friends/a lot of items? For leveling I tend to use [this amazing guide](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/nightfalls-wow-classic-horde-leveling-guide/) if you're horde, which details a step by step *effective* way to spend your time gaining experience, and minimize downtime for travel and such. Don't worry to much about skills, you will probably respec later in the game anyway, so play how you like and get to know your skills that way instead of blindly going for a guide, it will help you much more in the end!
---
Good luck! :)
---
awesome job !
---
That’s the one I grabbed, 100% sure of it. Will double check when I get home, at work now :(
---
Which one is it to make your hp and mp appear?
---
unregistered hypercam2 though
---
Winter Night has one fifth the ingredient cost as Robe of the Void too! No "bind on pick up" demonic rune farming. Not required to have 300 tailoring in order to craft it, only to have the recipe ninja looted by someone who just wants to put it on the Auction House when it drops. With 54 shadow damage, it could be really pre-raid BIS, and even T1 bis. But they really nerfed it with spell damage. All raid bosses that you would use this in T1 are either immune to fire, or highly resistant, and our only spammable fire spell generates high amount of threat. There is no incinerate, shadow is our only spell school for pve; like why nerf it..? :')
---
TIL people actually keep that keybind in place.
---
The best gold farming class (and arguably the best all around class) in the game right now needs a buff? I should've seen this coming from the undead mage...
---
Capslock is a pretty neat bind I find (:
---
"Contemplating on the irony, your soul and hearth feel rested"
---
Just report and move on homie. Blizzard will absolutely ban someone if they are verbally harassing you on different toons to avoid the ignore function.
---
Even World of Warcraft ;)
---
Thats stupid every group so far discussed in 5sec of useing chat if we need or greed.
---
There is no  generally accepted practice and don't even start with needing to sell on BOE even through someone else wants it to equip.
---
Rogues may be jerks, but we're competent and like to get stuff done jerks.
---
Are you experiencing any input lag with respect to your mouse and keyboard? Also how's the frame rate?
---
It's nice to see that we have finally come to an agreemant and that we should kick tanks that are stupid and slowing down the group aswell as mages that do the same.
---
That's a big birb.
---
Seriously, fuck this sub at the moment.
---
It took me ages to decide what class I wanted to play before settling on a mage and whenever I come here it's just people raging on the class and throwing around generalisations about those playing it.
---
Mage in my guild bought both of his for 100g during the first week. Now theyre selling for 200+ on AH
---
do you know about underneath undercity?
---
I have three alts; 1 level 18, 1 level 11 and 1 level 8, and all this while the main is still only 18 himself. I'm an altoholic and I have a problem.
---
Does it matter which Tiger or Wolf you tame? I have never played Vanilla or a Hunter so this is pretty new for me. I hit 39 when I realised my Bird still had level 1 Claw ( or Bite not sure which one is it). And how does it work if I tame a pet my own level, I have to increase its happiness and play with it for a while for it to get talent points?
---
Warriors are a hard fight for rogues at 60 when they have gear. While leveling as combat and I have riposte they're basically free kills.
---
As a healer there's what I call the "dps itch" that exists in groups.  When you're drinking, they're looking at your mana bar and deciding at what point of the drink they think you have enough mana for the next pull.  They kinda stand up and slowly creep forward towards the mobs, and perhaps start jumping a bit like a fidgety ADHD kid.  Meanwhile you're sat there hoping they let you drink enough to deal with the fact the tank is dps tanking and you forgot to train your last heal spell rank.
---
"Its normal not to trust someone".
---
No it isn't. Who actively engages someone who's started speaking with an automatic stance of distrust?
---
Yet you still felt the need to reply to him and be judgemental rather than take his word that it was a mistake or just not reply at all....... 
---
And I'm the one with something wrong with them. 
---
You are a dick too mate. Go away.
---
I have more than 12 days /played.. ama
---
I'm absolutely not salty. Just think that there's as little expression of skill in ganging up on someone as there is being level 60 and fucking up STV.
---
Mouse3
---
The proc is godly in pvp and its not unique so if you have two rings you have a double chance of it proccing. Rogues will hate themselves when they attack you xD
---
I don't think that's right at all, the smaller realms look to be way bigger than they actually are.
---
Yea I was in a snowstorm in winterspring
---
lol , why so many downvotes ,it just a GUILD NAME.
---
Gross
---
Isn't winter night 40 shadow, 40 frost?
---
Like i said, i never noticed it.
---
Rolled hord this time, but man do I miss Teldrassil and Darnassus.
---
Same man. Having responsibilities while your mage alt waits in brill sucks
---
&gt; Most warriors, especially on brand new servers as their first character aren't leveling with a weapon chain.
---
Given how I also have a disarm skill, can confirm this.
---
Pretty sure they where all guild mates
---
Agreed.  
---
As a healer i started to ignore dps classes that take aggro from attacking other mobs than the main target. I just let them die.
---
I mean, cities are more empty now because most people are out levelling. There's not that many lvl 60s. Give it a few more weeks and the major cities will be packed (hopefully they reduce layering as well by then)
---
On dreadmist eu, they brought bunch of Onyxia Guard(?) Dragons into the Stormwind Keep.
---
1. yes, but there's a difference between using an exploit to gain a tangible benefit in the game (IE layering for more gear), or just using it to have a little fun.
---
now if you were using that exploit to prevent people from buying recipes. then it IS a problem. because that has an economic impact. killing a couple people does not. you gain nothing from it.
---
2. how is it dumb logic, when it's evidenced by the post here that it would happen, hell it would happen if you didnt do anything at all apparently.
---
when someone kills you from a rooftop the response shouldnt be "oh, well I cant go up there, that would get me banned, 'Ill just wait for the GMs to handle it"
---
that's not very world of warcraft is it.
---
+1 for username (though I never got past thousand orcs)
---
It’s not the case on Skullflame. Just quality, organic, bespoke shitposting
---
What? It’s bis for locks until nax.
---
thank you very much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Again, mages don't dictate the pulls. Tanks do. I'm sorry that you can't get this through your head, but when you realize nobody wants you in their party maybe you'll understand.
---
 Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
---
Classic Snurk Bucksquick.
---
That might be the case for you, on average I easily get 50% of my HS fakecasts kicked on classic and I have done plenty of pvp. Was the same on private servers. There will always be trigger happy people screwing up their interrupts
---
bloodvine set is actually BiS over some BWL gear for casters
---
And once you leave, the losing side’s backup finally arrives and proceeds to murder everyone on your faction who was just quietly grinding quest mobs and minding their own business. 
---
As is tradition.
---
Everyone has incomplete toolkits as low level, not much to do about it.
---
Like i said we don't have the whole story why should someone side with op if he doesn't feel the need to provide all informations.
---
Who said its skill. It's pvp, fair unfair. I ganked peeps, got ganked, helped some alliance guys kill elites (then I got killed after a /kiss), won a 1v2, lost 1v1 (enemy had 30% hp) . It's fun it's not dota/lol
---
5% standard + 25% racial is pretty high.
---
 "Do not pull if you are not the tank. "
---
Was common sense back then, I never manage to do a dungeon without a mage wanting to aggro everything before me.
---
And in classic you can gank your own faction with a train of mobs!!
---
I have never played wow before. I don't really like mmos. I love classic. 
---
Having lots of fun, not rushing to 60 but playing a lot.
---
Using that. Must of missed that option.
---
I mean, I get people not wanting to be super amazing and perfect. Which is not at all what any of us ask for. It's just that these things are really simple. They don't require any real attention. In some ways they require less attention and doing what I've advised not to do actually requires effort on someone's part in a disruptive way.
---
/petfollow
---
/petpassive
---
I think the opposite is true (?).
---
You want to block all the smaller attacks from many mobs. Need the rage for bosses ?
---
He added that part after people started flaming him.
---
It’s in the game. Someone already went crazy in me in general chat for saying I was getting the trinket. So when I did I told general chat. He invited me and came right over to me to inspect. Boom. Defender of Timbermaw equipped. I have a whole video recorded of the guy doing this.
---
Working as intended...finally.
---
As a healer, thank you. Keep doing what you’re doing.
---
and if you get a bad tank then you kicke em and get a new one that dictates pulls better because the other one is wasting people's time.
---
You gotta step your dark game up man, those soulshards won't fill themselves. I recommend opening a cult, something stupid like Cult of the Damned or Christianity - anything will do, people are stupid.
---
I never initiate random fights with people who are levelling but I'll generally try and repeatedly hunt down and kill anyone who starts something with me. I'm noticing a pattern that anyone on or around my level ignores me whereas if they've 4+ levels higher they'll try and gank me. Had quite a few rogues jump me when I'm on a quest mob but fortunately they all seem to forget that popping evasion just feeds me big overpower crits.
---
yes :)
---
Do you have experience using Combat Daggers? I am finding it difficult to keep up with other Combat Sword 2x Dal Rend Rogues in raw damage, even with Perditions. This is currently in dungeons like UBRS. The positional requirement + energy cost makes it feel clunky at times. I haven't had the chance to test it out in MC yet.
---
Check the NotABugList.. I think this was in that list, and it's working as intended.
---
That's exactly what I've noticed! Always ?? Level horde wandering around mid level zones. Like maybe if you didn't bust through 1-60 like a coked-up rat in a maze you wouldn't be so bored that you've resorted to killing lowbies when there isn't even an honor system in place.
---
That's not how tanking works, tanks (assuming they're competent) are target swapping constantly, so unless you're literally pressing FF constantly (which I guess is an option) assisting the tank is by no means a guarentee you're on the right target.
---
From my experience with private servers (TBC and WOTLK ones), you can easily put 10k people together (even at 1x) with no issues if you have enough content to evenly distribute the players. The problem with classic atm is the lack of content. But thing will resolve after phase 3 hits and people will be able to do PvP in BG
---
I managed to get a Pendulum of Doom off the AH for 49g... Now i can't afford my level 40 mount :( \*sad orc noises\*
---
How did you linked the item so quickly? Did you even shift click it?
---
Hello my Zandalari friend :P It's not gonna be 3k players I can assure you
---
You killed them but you also damaged their horns in the process.
---
They had to do quite some things to get this behaviour back from their current constant regen.. in both classic and retail (which classic regen is based off) the energy gained over longer periods of times is constant. The recoveryrate/tick is not constant.
---
Not doing exactly what you want doesn't make them "bad". They have a right to play how they like without being demeaned. The game is not a race.
---
Why can't they just change the damage in retail to just be "none", "low", "medium", "high", or "devastating!"
---
Based on how many percent of the targets health it deals.
---
WotLK without the 12 bazillions dailies and cross-server LFG would be nice, but that's my uninformed opinion
---
It really is, I've had bullets fly off at a 160 degree angle hitting a target behind the wall behind me.
---
Which addon does simplify the HP/MANA bars of party members?
---
Yes, sometimes they do.
---
Good story
---
Meanwhile here I am hating the fact that I am forced to wear dresses. Gimme back hum mogs plz... T.T
---
To be fair, I've seen people trying to organize groups for SFK in Barrens chat, and that dungeon's on the other continent, so it's not that crazy to imagine Alliance might have something to chat about over there while possibly farming tin or harassing low level players by either ganking them or killing quest giving NPCs (or doing ratchet quests).
---
Its called Leeway.
---
Rogues after picking up "sword specialization" wanna utylize the use of sinister strike around the swing timer
---
Do I have to pay attention to the main hand or off hand?
---
yeah and if the other people in the group wants to play a way differently  than the tank then we're going to kick them and get a better one that doesn't waste hours more than they need to
---
Skeram
---
They cost less mana per cast, but they give less healing per mana until you get plus healing. Combine that with the fact that you need to cast more of them, which means less time in 5 second rule regen. I just don't see any benefit to downranking until like level 50 except for when you want to top up a dps without overhealing.
---
&gt; If you leave something in game that is a known exploit then they have no right to ban for it. 
---
It's their intellectual property and they can do whatever they want and ban you for whatever they want. If it's in the game and it's exploitable but against ToS then you, as a player, are breaking the ToS and therefore you should be banned for it.
---
You are ridiculous. If someone is good aoe farming doesnt change that. If someone is bad questing doesnt change that.
---
What was the item you won? The name of the chest piece.
---
Fishing level?
---
I am impressed as fuck. I want this mount too, ive farmed it in BC but they buffed the rep gains by x10 iirc but even then that took me close to a month. Any tips you can give for farming it?
---
Troll?
---
The only valid quit reason I've seen was; "all my friends are scattered across various servers and both factions. Classic isn't fun anymore."
---
Personally I'm doing OK. I am happy with my single friend choice. They've never hurt me emotionally over the decade and a bit. Also, I spent over half of classic playing for myself, so I'm less dependant on preexisting friends for my social satisfaction. I'm having fun catching up over bnet.
---
Everything higher than default "classic" preset is blasphemy
---
For the love of God don't. Alliance are insufferable on Heartseeker.
---
LFG Wailing (anus) Caverns
---
At the Texas ren festival it’s Christoph the insulter if I remember correctly.  Same concept.  Does a night show where he’ll use some pretty vulgar language.
---
Good stuff!
---
Agreed, much more fun than combat. As for rushing to 60, I kind of wish I was higher than I currently am (druid is 40, mage is 24, priest is 18) as I'd be able to make a lot more gold than I currently am, but regardless I'm having fun taking it slowly.
---
Our Cath runs with the best group every clocked at 10.5 minutes per run, and thats timed from when we enter to when we exit the dungeon.
---
And a 15 min Melee cleave is really really good, dont get me wrong, but its never going to be even close to a good spell-cleave.
---
People don't even say "hi" in retail
---
It's why a Runescape classic voting system would be great for adding qol features without detracting from classic's strengths.
---
Until middle aq 40 there is no need for a shield
---
Looks just like incendius.
---
and a new generation of people who hate the opposite faction is born "motherfucker I was just sitting there minding my own business and 20 of them fuckers came and corpse camped me for 40 minutes"
---
True but if you dont try you dont know your parties limits :P
---
Im never really the "safe" player in games. I always test out my limits. THats the fun part for me. Doing every content safe is boring for me.
---
There was a saying in Vanilla "You pull it you tank it." I apply this as a hard rule in Classic dungeons. One of the core mechanics of vanilla WoW was threat and threat management was what separated good DPS from bad, not who could do the most damage. People asked for the classic experience, they better damn well expect it or go back to retail.
---
If someone presses need on BOE, you need too. Chests should be rolled.
---
If someone sees a herb/mine, they'll directly loot it or ask for it, then roll. That's debateable.
---
I always ask 'roll for x?" at first sight of a chest or nose and everyone tends to agree. If people want ffa then fair enough.
---
You said they're extremely common. If what the other guy is saying is true, then at least 4/9 other classes are more common. Common is relevant, so yeah they're not 'extremely common' if what /u/TehChels has stated is true.
---
It's random. Some days I get 0, some days i get two arcane crystals in 1 node. The other night I got 7 in 1 hour. It's completely random
---
I've always been friendly in PvP. Yesterday that changed. I did the chicken escort in Tanaris. A horde warrior that I could have easily killed ran up to me. I /wave he /wave back. Later I noticed he kept following me. He didn't attack so I let him be, maybe he was curious about the quest. No, he had /w his friend to run over the whole map to help him kill me, I was less than 30 seconds away from finishing the escort quest when they 2v1 me. I regret sooooo much that I didn't just kill that fucker the second he came close to my chicken. That's a completely new level of sadism. Kill me, whenever, 5v1, if you're 20 levels above me, BUT NOT IN THE LAST 30 SECONDS OF A 20 MINUTE ESCORT QUEST.
---
Can confirm, am rogue, and this is my class fantasy. Especially bleeding warrior dry 🧛‍♂️
---
Lol Mages devalue themselfs because they are a dime a dozen. Same with Warriors. Everyone Just looking Up Guides for "the best class". Idiots
---
Yeah, apparently Blizzard felt the need to recreate "lag" in fights so it ends up being super messy. I am annoyed by it too because even looting things is delayed!
---
I was in Tanaris the other day and there was a sandstorm, was really awesome to see these weather effects. I do turn down the weather density when it rains in felwood tho, dang that's annoying.
---
True but. im never really the "safe" player in games. I always test out my limits. Thats the fun part for me. Doing every content safe is boring for me.
---
who pissed in your cereal jesus christ.
---
this is bad writing
---
You're going to have a bad time trying to play a shaman as a pure dps, because they're not. Dont play an ele like a mage, or an enhance like a warrior. 1, you'll never top.the charts. 2, they're soooo much more than a pure dps. They're utility gods with all their totems and healing and control.
---
What if they aren't attacking anyone?
---
It's more bittersweet. You're impressed and disgusted at the same time.
---
I feel bad when i completely demolish someone who attacked me. Like i'm attacking some mob and a rogue opens on me. I send my cat stun him and slow him down and kill him before he even took 20% of my health. I feel sad what if its some old guy trying to have fun but he sucks too much so he like gets depressed
---
From my personal experience by being put in a lot of different situations, you start to adapt to these situations. 
---
There may be people who just can't learn from mistakes but here is an anecdote by me:
---
I always start out with barely and keybinds and no addons, because I can't be bothered. But from the time I learn sweeping strikes and a bit later whirlwind I'm very hard pressed to properly cleave down two mobs at the same time if I don't look into macros, keybinds, proper rotation, spacing I fail.
---
Now I learned how to cleave while questing
---
If I want to tank a dungeon I need to acquire defensive stance, learn the bare essentials of tanking like taunt, keybind again. 
---
Now I learned how to tank two mobs.  
---
You see where I'm going? If you only do ONE thing you never improve in any other aspect of the game, and this is the problem with hunters and mages who are currently often as bad as huntards. They never had to adapat, because AoEing works perfectly fine. So why improve?
---
So... are players neutral lawful or neutral evil?
---
Are classic servers same as Bfa?The ping and all?
---
The pirate area seems permanently contested by swarms of alliance and horde. Two days ago on Golemagg I couldn’t finish my damn quest for hours.
---
It has died down, although there was a queue of around 300 yesterday evening.
---
Real horde don't mix with undead. Real horde lives in the mud of orgrimmar.
---
On Benediction as well. Blasted Lands yesterday was absolute chaos.
---
Oh my god, THANK you ! :), this is literally a blessing
---
Playing noggenfogger. Friendly community, kinda behind on raids, always medium-high, queues are 300-1k but no more than that (1k queue ends in 10 mins)
---
Does rogues talent "Ruthlessness" grant the chance per combo point spent or flat per finisher? 
---
Based on this text in guide on icyveins:
---
" Ruthlessness is run in the sword build for Rogue. You will gain the most out of this talent if you use your finishing moves at 5 combo points to guarantee the combo point gain. Using a finisher at 4 combo points and failing to gain the combo point will net a slight DPS loss."
---
I would say per combo point but the description doesnt mention it.
---
Ic, from what i gathered people seemsed to find it a must have for druis in raids to have inproved motw.
---
I usually don't role for boe just takes too long but chests always roll
---
Oh yeah it looks about the same, just less saturated lol
---
As a warrior, I tend to never invite hunters. Not only do many of them not understand that they need to turn off growl despite being told to do so many times, but they also let their pet run around pulling random mobs wiping the group. They also steal melee weapons that are crucial for a warrior. Like that huntard that stole the ravager from my mate the other day, fucking what?
---
If this is how you get to your mage trainer, you no longer need a mage trainer. You've surpassed normal magic.
---
You could try Skillet-Classic, it works pretty nice with tailoring

---
Hamstring kiting is still perfectly possible, you just run away from the mob instead of through them.
---
How to make profits as a blacksmith, get 300 and get rare patterns.
---
How to make money as mining, post everything you mine.
---
But the best way is farming high value mobs that drops greys worth 5s+ and also mining the nodes in that area.
---
Around level 40 there are several spots that make roughly 6-10g per hour, and if you get some nice drops you can sell on AH + Ore the gold per hour goes up.
---
I really recommend having a bank alt, to store mats for professions AND post actions / check AH for good deals/items you can sell for 5-10 gold more.
---
Yeah buddy, thats how this works. I propose you make a ticket with "fucking trash GMs cant ban me lul virgins" just to show them!
---
Peacemaker is your better option. Because it won't be contested. And otherwise Dual Boneslicing Hatches are better then these.
---
Checked. Are correct. But in the graphic it only shows the Week, the patch would arrive in. As The projected Dates are exact, they can point to one week prior or after the original patchday. Depending on wether the Patchday would be a saturday or sunday in 2019/20/21
---
Say “Sorry” in the chat and tell them tho do /roll
---
End.
---
Take warriors, too, please. I'm begging you. Nobody wants us. I can match or beat mages between whirlwind and sweeping strikes. I can act as a backup tank if shit goes sideways.
---
Please, take us!
---
Someone!
---
...anyone!
---
......I just wanna hit shit with my hammer, man.
---
Blizzard could fit 20,000+ on a single layer/server if they wanted to however the game was designed for 3,500-4,000 players max on one server.
---
As someone who tanks and heals on my druid, I have to say it's pretty annoying from a healer's perspective even though it's usually doable.
---
Oftentimes those "tanks" also are not in def-stance because they cannot use their damage-abilities there.
---
But it goes even further. Itemization, what abilties are used and the whole mentality of how many mobs to pull.
---
So it's basically a dps who has most of the aggro and not something worthy of the notion "tank".
---
The time that is gained by faster killing is lost back due to me having to take more mana-breaks.
---
The difference is really massive. With a real tank who pulls as small as possible, marks focus-target and cc and uses sunder-armor to boost the DPS of others, rather than just his own, the mobs die so quickly one after another meaning that oftentimes one single big heal per fight is enough and I have regged it all back by the time we pull the next enemies.
---
The whirlwind-using, No-CC-, no-focus-2-h-tank on the other hand... Yeah, maybe the fight is like 10% shorter but I have to sit for 15 seconds after to reg my mana-back.
---
Yes you are
---
I see your point and ofc it depends on time. My answer was more like an encouragement to do new character. His question sounded to me lile he is wondering how much he needs to do to get back where je is now. And level 35 is obtainable pretty easily when playong warlock.
---
I just rerolled a druid from my priest because I found the priest boring and I remembered why I loved Druids so much.
---
Druid has always been my favorite class and always will be, who gives a fuck about being BiS healer when I can turn into a bear.
---
better get gnome mages before they get you (when your low health or fighting mobs or with a night elf hunter)
---
I too, dinged like a MAN
---

---
I just dm people and tell them they’re ugly irl then move on
---
&gt; With exalted rep, you get a 20% discount, so $800 gold.
---
Not true, the only discounts in the game are:
---
- 10% at honored
---
- 10% with PvP rank 3 (not ingame yet)
---
so the mount will be 900g no matter what, for now at least.
---
Dps numbers in BfA are not even that high... now MoP... those warlock the days...
---
Holy shit. My OCD can finally rest!
---
If I had a dollar every time I saw that.. usually just make the group and have 4/5 people
---
He is 4 levels higher than the intended level for the dungeon. I would also be pulling everything if I was him. Slow ass dungeon  runs
---
I like to pop into duskwood every now and then and terrorize the locals. I feel like its what an orc would actually do
---
Thought yap was fap and I was going to agree.
---
The pre raid BIS stuff is so AIDS. Dude is making a point, better for a mellee class if no one else wants. Also bone slicing hatchets I would argue are better for a hunter and clearly for the class. But hey keep looking up your PRE BIS zomg this is the best guides and dogging everyone that doesn't see it your way.
---
Warrior op
---
Horde here,
---
I use to be so mellow with world pvp. Never attacked people questing. Only attacked if someone was ganking a fellow horde near me. 
---
But after questing and getting attacked in the middle of a hard mob, at half health. So don’t hold back no mo!
---
we say that about ally too. Really makes you think doesnt it lol
---
Look for the Hamstring Method on youtube and youll find a guide for a leveling build!
---
Yeah seriously, starting with LFM when you have 0 members makes it so much easier to get a group.
---
Good but dont cut the part that priest melted your 30% hp face.

I was too young to know. I loved that game
---
You’re lucky... or well I mean it happens sure? 
---
But im more social a single day in classic than I was in 2 months of BFa. 
---
You are FORCED to interact, no quest markers, hard enemies, larger world, spending much longer times in zones. 
---
The very nature of LFD initiates passiveness and being quiet. Classic is completely opposite. 
---
The social aspect of retail is terrible. You’re just an exception.
---
I did not die tho, will and i ran in
---
Guys we have a badass over here
---
is this still correct? will you continue updating or is this considered done
---
I feel discouraged to play because of this, it's so difficult to search or try to form a group for a dungeon at this point, I play as a warlock, keep spamming chat for razorfen downs but getting overwhelmed by spam for cleave groups... It's like there's no space left for people who just want to chill, I thought that classic would be different from retail, where "gogogo mentality" rules
---
Or time I marked skull and x. Typed in chat the kill order. Skull and x were last to die.
---
It’s not the same at all... because people don’t interact at all in retail.
---
I have never ever seen a devilsaur on my server. They are an endangered species
---
This is a great collection of many useful addons, some of which I hadn't even heard despite having played about as long as anyone - I imagine newer players will find even more golden nuggets from the list. Greatly summarized and very much to the point. Thanks for this.
---
Please elaborate.
---
I need both right?
---
He might have been trying to help you. I've done this some times as well with quest mobs, when a hordie has accidentally pulled two of them and I see him struggling, I'll aggro the one he hasn't damaged yet. I help him by getting the second mob off him, and I help myself by getting a quest kill. Win win.
---
Was in STV the other day with absolutely nobody about, just grinding Naga near the fountain at the top of the hill. Lvl 55+ warlock rounds the corner and just immediately lays into me. Why? What possible reason? Answer: malicious glee and spite. The place is going to erupt when honor is introduced.
---
Thunderclap is straight-up terrible for aggro generation. The raw damage on its highest rank might manage to just about keep up with the raw damage you have on Whirlwind at level 36. It exists for the debuff and for arms warriors to use until they have whirlwind, at which point it's a dps loss to ever press that button.
---
The F is that thumbnail. I simply won't watch the video out of spite cus of this garbage clickbait picture, jesus
---
FFFFFFFFFffffffffffffffff
---
Tell him you don't want.
---
If he is an asshole and harass you, block and ignore him, you win.
---
If he isn't one and is happy to just play with you anyway, you also win.
---
He calls ghost wolf “his pet”
---
I know a mage.. he gives level 45 food and water away for free and sells ports AT COST. “Tips appreciated”
---
He made 280g last week in ports and water from the tips alone. He doesn’t even have to try to make a profit
---
ik that but the talent gives a chance for another strike if I understand it correctly
---
so the question is
---
I cast sinister strike with MH, sword specialization procs
---
does it reset my MH or both or how it works? What should I pay attention to
---
What are your UI addons sir?
---
My favorite part of this is the waiting part ... “five seconds after I start getting hit, not five seconds after I pull ...”  Huge difference and sooo true.
---
Imagine me as the tank, 30% rage bar banked so I’m feeling really good about the next pull, all melee, throw a feral faerie fire up on skull, here they come ... woooosh, warrior charges through me, to the unmarked ‘third’ mob ... arrrrgggghhhh?!!?!?
---
If you need by accident you can get everyone to reroll and reroll yourself and give it to the winner.
---
The renderdistance for players is the same as it was in Vanilla. It just seems much closer since the viewing distance has been increased.
---
I personally kill every single gnome, paladin and hunter i see. if they are +5 levels lower than me, then i leave them alone.
---
You get the deposit back
---
tailors can craft shirts of all colors
---
You’re fine. 
---
Wind serpents lightning breath does ignore armor and attacks at range. If you enjoy this pet, you’re fine to level with it. 
---
Use petopia to see where you can get increased ranks of lightning breath.
---
But you’re forced to play much more and are forced to keep subscriptions for much longer comparable to classic.
---
The only thing overly insane in time investing was pvp grinding. 
---
Everything else seems much more chill comparable to retail.
---
Doing this with /sit is incredibly hilarious as well, btw. Found it by accident a few days ago, have been baffling horde and alliance alike
---
How do you counter Viper Sting kiting as a shadow priest?
---
...
---
&gt; Taurens for some reason
---
Its per design. Their hitbox is bigger, meaning when range is determined from the edge of your hitbox, they can hit from further away. Thenagain, you can hit THEM from further too.
---
Wow I died laughing too, ha.
---
Why are people always trying to show off their pointless game experiences that nobody cares. Ok you laughed, no need to make a fuse about it and tell everybody for fuck's sake. Looks like a toddler attitude: look mom I had a social interaction haha, must show it to strangers. Smh
---
Can see how you slowly discovered addons throughout time. this is sooo cool, are you able to recreate each screenshot in the new wow classic vs the old? Be a neat comparison i reckon for any future post.
---
Truth. I post Mithril on the AH and it's bought within 5 minutes every time. Even at 3am.
---
Break up with them honestly and be up front about it. They'll be hurt, but it's better than stringing them on.
---
There's like thousands of videos of all kinds of things. Not one with this incredible aoe tactic? What about some forum posts? Anything?
---
The content is pvp not pve... pve is not really the classic wow content
---
It's good to have all things like chores done beforehand. This way strangely enough WoW can even boost your productivity. 👍
---
i can game while on reddit.
---
I think 5 yards back from caster max range would be where it should be
---
&gt;Nope
---
PvP-itemization is a whole different topic.
---
You probably already use different gear depending on whether you tank, cat or heal.
---
For PvP I recommend making another item-set for that purpose specifically and wear whatever has the most stats in total.
---
For example in my bear-gear I have about 1700 Mana at level 45, in my heal-gear it is about 3200 and my PvP-gear has about 2700.
---
Having enough mana to change forms and use heals if needed is vital in PvP. Staying in one form because you can't afford changing it, means you'll lose to almost everyone.
---
The Flag-carrier-PvP-spec btw. is 8-12-31 with -30% on shifts from the balance-tree and swiftmend to have more instant-heals on a shorter cooldown.
---
This. It isn't optimal but it's the only thing you can do in a random group. 
---
I personally couldn't care less about gold in wow and prefer to give loot to people who will use it instead of selling it but people are greedy as fuck and can't be trusted.
---
Thank you. At the moment I'm a bit overwhelmed by past commissions and patron rewards, but I will reopen commissions soon-ish.
---
Golemagg EU here, horde outnumber alliance at least 3:1 in every contested zone, even searing gorge which is RIGHT NEXT to Ironforge. 
---
Don't bother questing unless you are in at least a duo. Horde love killing people who can't fight back. 
---
Felt good when my duo (48 mage, 50 hunter) beat two level 52 horde (priest, mage) as well as a rogue and warlock who joined in to gank us though. (Then two level 60 horde came and corpse camped us)
---
Honestly horde players are playing easy mode. Pretty casual if you ask me. If you want a real challenge, play alliance and fight with worse racials while being significantly outnumbered.
---
Fuck the horde, fuck their stinky mud huts, and fuck their complete lack of honour.
---
I'm horde so it's just for exploration :)
---
I'm pretty sure you mean tabard. As for shoulders, I this those will be:

Crappy screenshot. And for cape, you have 9 capes for level &lt;19 to wear with that icon. Since we can't see which one he have, good luck guessing.
---
I know my wife wouldn't let me hang up guitars on the wall, not to mention being allowed to play wow on the living room TV.
---
Living vicariously through you PIRATES
---
You can make that post for any class. Especially hunters.
---
Oopsie
---
If everyone is good and take it easy then yeah we can still heal. but if everyone goes balls to the wall, then you OOM the first half of the fight.
---
My bags/bank is not big enough for me to carry 2 sets of gear, maybe a couple of items, but not enough for me to magically have loads more +int
---
Pre-casting helps with long cast times, too, but hell I feel weak compared to the other healers during this level range.
---
Dude I've been thinking about this addon too!
---
Or very low level tailoring... something like 50-60 range.
---
&gt; Yeah, that's late game and no one denies that.
---
No that's level 42.
---
Nah it fits... 
---
“BFa is a huge bastedization of the game that the boys loved”
---
"How will I ever got 60 if it takes me 6 hours to level instead of four??"
---
By questing and running dungeons normally and dinging in six hours
---
"Absolutely impossible unless I find a cleave grp that isn't filled with noobs"
---
Or you could quest
---
"I just hate how this game requires you to grow up and aoe dungeon down to make any progress"
---
Umm, hello?
---
"I've spent all morning spanking org trying to find a zf grp for nothing. This is impossible."
---
Imagine just talking about it but never having the courage to experience it yourself.
---
Graphics quality checks out
---
Didnt know actually, i was level 30 or so when this happened and they killed me pretty fast, not that i tried to fight back.
---
That's why Natural Shapeshifter in balance tree is pretty much required for pvp. At 60 your mana pool will be a lot bigger and you will get a lot of int from resto gear.
---
Those people dislike the adventure.
---
They just wanna stand in town and complain about the lack of endgame content
---
Once I'm at my computer, sure.
---
If they did add guild housing I would hope that it was added to the persistent world. Not instanced.
---
So yea, it would be limited, but it could make for some great guild PvP where they could fight over the castles etc.
---
At least that is what I want. But wow didn't go that route.
---
yeah cos i have money to buy epics on AH to resell...
---
Have you seen the amount of legit baron runs completed?
---
A big part of this is that this is an actual upgrade that you can *feel*. Not some bullshit like that 1% dmg increase of retail.
---
uwu
---
Huh. On pservers the sticky aggro'd to Bolivar. I'm horde this time around so I haven't seen it myself.
---
Ic, that reminds me ive got a question about gear. since we druids can regen mana in combat. how inportant is spirit compared to int?
---
Thanks for the kind words and advice. I see the place on petopia for lightning breath stuff.
---
If you dont mind me asking do you have any advice on any other skills it should have? Should i just use lightning breath and growl?
---
So, I understand for like FPS or a racing game or something, but would latency really be a massive issue for playing WoW? This looks awesome and I'd love to give it a go
---
No, Classes are already at final phase from the start. Only dungeon, raid, item, pvp content is gated with phases.
---
if you don't wait 3 seconds for any tank you won't make it to 60
---
I am going to have a hard time believing that you can actually see on a character model which character is which, especially considering the gear is going to change, including helmets (so you won't even see the hair anyway).
---
If you took another of my race, gave them the exact same things except for different hair, and stuck them in my gear, there would literally be 0 difference between us because the helmet is covering up the hair anyway.
---
Chucks?
---
Stonespine is good tbh. Not full but very populated.
---
Yes, it seems clearer now, thank you for that! But is the 8 just an arbitrary decision?
---
“I have to collect raptor eyes, ok let’s open my map to see where....oh, it’s the whole zone. Thanks question, now I can’t see the other objective locations.”
---
Dumb question but, after your action bar fills up with skills what is the most efficient way of using new skills? Ive unlocked the multibar and I just click the rest of the skills with my mouse
---
It’s a shit answer, but, imo, when levelling, it matters so little that just do what you find fun 
---
I’ve completely gone against the grain for my talent tree and I’m just having fun with it, the first respec is cheap and I can get serious later 
---
Just fall in love with the nostalgia and if you’re having real problems then respec 
---
But my biggest barrier isn’t killing mobs, it’s getting ganked aha, so I don’t think you’ll sacrifice much at all by doing the dagger build you want
---
Not worth if for PvE only. There are slightly less powerful equivalent and you'll get a ring of spell power eventually.
---
ic whell i difinetly cant get nat shifting with hearth of the wild.
---
So why are so many content creators talking about phases and classes getting better or worse?
---
Sadly damage dealing Shamans have no place in dungeons or raids, their mana issues are extreme. Elemental can be a really effective PvP build though, and practically anything works for the open world. Enhancement can do good work in PvP, but unlike Elemental, it's not controlled in any way, which leans it to a more meme-like result. Good for clip videos though, as you'll only have to show when you wrecked someone, and not the many times the RNG failed you and you got squashed. 
---
Shaman is very much considered a healer outside of PvP. And if you want to raid, you'd likely have your guild strongly pressuring you into grabbing Mana Tide Totem (31 Resto), which hampers you ability to do anything other than heal. Though you *might* find a guild that would let you raid with the Elemental / Resto hybrid.
---
I tried RFC on my low level Ele Shaman and oof... I've never melee'd so much as a caster. Though the Nature Immunity didn't help in that specific dungeon, even when I could cast, I'd OOM insanely quick compared to the locks n mages. Weren't even using the max ranks of my spells...
---
I've been thinking about this, and I get why it was lowered again, as it made it way too easy for ranged class to see melee's coming in hot in PvP. BUT, what I also dont understand is, with how it is now, you more or less NEED a dottimer addon or to keep constantly watching the enemies unitframes EVEN if they are out of range to do anything.
---
A good middleground IMO would be to make it so if you have aggroed a unit or enemy, or maybe even if y ou only have a debuff on it, then the nameplate goes to lets say 40yards, which is quite far. But all other nameplates keep the default value.
---
I second this! I use it and it lets you see your healing
---
I would only have lightning breath on and use a button to use growl. Lightning breath uses 50 focus so it won’t go off easily if growl keeps activating.
---
Classes are final, the only reason people say some specs/classes gets weaker later is because other specs/classes scale better with gear.
---
There are two kinds of people. Those who want to experience and almost no input before doing x (don't follow guides, backpackers etc) and those who like to do research before doing x.   
---
Now, there is nothing wrong with either of those two approaches. The problem as I see it is when you apply this logic to ALL people. The "don't read guides, dont do anything, dont use addons, run around and die, its fun" advices to all players is a bit annoying.   
---
Also, most people that do research (2nd group) also tend to go by multiple sources before landing a decision. So, the sum of all advices gives them a pretty good outcome in what to start out with, and not necessarily AoE mage.   
---
Take me, I quit during Vanilla because 0 research and bad choices. In classic I've done my research, and I'm loving every minute of it!
---
When I kill mobs the log says I get a group bonus, yeah. I don't know what the calculations for it is, though. 
---
The thing with Classic (at least in PvE) is that it is very easy rotation wise. Just take a mage for example... All they need to do is Frostbolt, Frostbolt.... Frostbolt... occasional CC. That's it! 
---
Warlock - Macro with Shadow Bolt + pet attack. Also other keybinds for Dots. 
---
Paladin - I use it as healer and occasional CC for "oh sh\*t" moments. 
---
Priest - Macro of /castsequence Mind Flay, Mind Flay, Mind Blast etc. etc... Another keybind for Dots and maybe for fear too etc. 
---
I basically try to break every class down as simple as possible when it comes to PvE. Like all the healing is done with the Click Bars. DPS is on my 2 key. AoE dps is on my 3 key. Instant DOTS (all classes that can DOT) is on Alt+1 key. Stun (rotating classes that can stun) on my R key. CC such as counterspell on my E key.
---
So Im following wowisclassic guide for rogue and they advice you to pick "Remorsless Attacks" and "Improved Poisons".
---
Are those talents good? They seems pretty mediocre to me but Im a noob
---
Wouldnt "Agression" or "Endurance" or even "Relentless Strikes" be better spent points?
---
That's not how ninjaing works. You're no ninja
---
I basically do the same, I ignore other players, but if they gank me or I see them up to it I will follow them around and spawn camp them until the log off.
---
Don't pull when healer is oom
---
MSBT will do that for you.
---
Seeing this over and over i would say pretty high
---
/s
---
Because some classes/specs scale better than others with gear
---
Because either they have no idea, or the mentioned classes' performance depends on loot which is not yet available.
---
I tried doing only graves and can get like 40-50g pretty safe per hour
---
"Long grind"...classic released hardly a month ago.
---
Your definition of "long grind" is strange.
---
I regularly use this so that when my wife complains that I'm playing WoW all day, I can correctly inform her that I only played for 6 hours and 39 minutes this session.
---
Somehow she doesn't appreciate this answer.
---
You really don’t need the maces to play a bear tank. Your difficulty comes from being less bulky than a warrior not threat.
---
The only crime here is that you can't wear them both!
---
Some say he's still dancing to this day..
---
are you a wizard ?
---
Because they are idiots, the classes itself won't change but ITEMS will change their performance.
---
It's not against ToS technically but it is widely regarded as a dick move and will quickly earn you a bad reputation on your server
---
Someone should make an add on which calculates flight times so you can plan accordingly
---
If they could take the lift in tb, why not the one in 1kn?
---
Yeah okay having an aoe class that keeps aoeing in your single target group sucks. You just tell them to stop aoeing and if they don't, you replace them.
---
But what I don't get is all the hate about aoe farming groups that's going on around here. Leveling in Classic is a huge pain, we all know it. That pain is lessened when you spend some time getting extra levels grinding dungeons, and aoe groups are the most efficient at it. Now I get that it sucks : it's unfair. As a war or a rogue for example, you can't do anything to contribute to these groups so you're not even allowed in. But that's just Classic for you. Classic has the shittiest balance and worse is that it's intended to. It's honestly not a game for everyone. In fact, I think it's mostly a game for nostalgic people.
---
But anyway, I know you're not complaining about unfairness (it's just that some people are so I wanted to say my piece), you're just kind of being annoyed by these people who want to make it to 60 as quickly as possible. Journey not destination, right ? Nah. I'm sorry but leveling in Classic is a massive pain, and I completely agree with people who want to take shortcuts. I say play the game however you want to play. I'd rather someone gets to 60 by aoe grinding dungeons than have them trying to get there the "normal way" and getting turned off and burning out because the alternative is too slow and boring for them.
---
Do you just type /sit and then press W repeatedly?
---
Assuming that every weapon shown has a +15 agility enchanted to it... let's take a little look. This is assuming a +13% haste quiver. We will go withOUT any talents as well. Using 100 base DPS just to make things easy. Here's the webpage: http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/

Del Rends LOSES in DPS and health points. Except look at the chance to crit. Those of us who are all about crit will go for Dawn's Edges. For those of us who like a nice balance of DPS and crit, Del Rends seems to be the way to go.
---
Also, if you happen to have Counterattack, The off-hand of Rend provides a .17% increase to chance to crit.
---
Hunters will hold onto Dal Rends a lot longer than rigues would, also dagger spec.
---
In short, hunters have just as much to gain as rogues to in getting Del Rends
---
There are a few 30-33 quests in South Shore (Hillsbrad), Murlocs, Murlocs Heads, Lions, Syndicate Bois, etc.
---
There's decent horde population, but for them the zone spans over 10 levels so a decent amount of them will be under lvl 25.
---
But we got there in the end x
---
similarly a friend of mine was pretty excited for WoW Classic cause he only joined in WoD and was eager to see what WoW used to be like. he played his warrior until 20 putting talents into prot tree and hasn't been online since. Although his excuse was he is too invested in mythic raiding and other games that he can't manage playing classic too. I get that but it's a bummer
---
Dreadmist looks good to me. Good balance between Horde and Alliance. 
---
Med population during day
---
High population at evenings.
---
No Q's
---
None of us are combat for pvp , we are combat cos ass/sub are rubbish for soloing mobs
---
What class is the troll ?
---
I enjoy the grind for The best possible gear for my class, i dont feel like im ruining anything for myself, all The Youtube clips / guides online, you can ignore them.
---
If you dont enjoy playing with "my type"of ppl, try finding someone likeminden like yourself.
---
And remember vanilla content had been played by many players for sooo long, so the information about whats actually best for your class is, is out there and why not take advantage of it? 
---
Enjoy the game how you like and let others play it how they like 😁
---
I go PW:S -&gt; SW:P, -&gt; mind blast -&gt; wand, then rotate into renew, PW:S, mind blast and wand if my hp gets low. Against harder mobs I throw in a mind flay or two. You should try to stay above 50-60% mana after each kill to let spirit tap top you up properly if you want to minimize downtime and have a bit excess mana in case of adds or gank attempts.
---
I legit got kicked from a guild because of one of these guys and a guildie who thought i was annoying
---
Yeah... You are beginning to enter the Level range where you won't be able to avoid PVP on a PVP Server.
---
I mean that is why we rolled on a PVP Server afterall. To be able to do pvp.
---
Well after 10+ years and many mmos, people got better at doing shit.
---
You cant expect the game to be played exactly the same as 10years ago, it was a different era.
---
If it's hat I important for you to play the standard group in a dungeon, finding a guild / discord community is probably your best bet.
---
I started my Druid but find it dull around lvl 27 and atm I so enjoy my Hunter cus it is such a chill leveling experience. 
---
So now I Go back and forth... cant decide what to main. ;-(
---
Just always be the last to roll.
---
For real. As soon as I had the gold I bought a 14-slot quiver and 3 14-slot bags. Yes it set me back from my level 40 mount a little bit. Yes it was worth every penny.
---
my spy add on alerts me even when I dont see the players on the map
---
Mages start strong and say strong in late game, and it’s a good choice if you like the play style.
---
absolutely, I grinded lots of mob on my level in the 30s for silk cloth and gained so much exp along the way.
---
Those things aren‘t possible anymore in WoW Classic, right?
---
Ok thanks
---
I tank whenever I don't last spot join as DD in dungeons. I actually don't taunt mobs if the DDs in the group cant target the same mobs. If they get aggro I expect them to move to me so I can pick it up again without running around taking blows to my back. 
---
Even the most retarded players tend to start running towards me after 2-3 deaths without me saying a word. I'm not gonna tell people how they should play their game, but I'm sure as shit not gonna exhaust myself trying to cover for their constant missplays. 
---
Also, when I start hitting the floor because my healer is busy healing our groups mage thats when I'll warn them once and the second time I'll remove them from the group.
---
5man raid dps heal specials:
---
1 heal = 1s
---
10 heals = 5s (50% bulk discount)
---
Unlimited throughout raid = 1g
---
Warlock entire raid specials for life tap, top those dps meters!
---
HoT after each pull = 5g
---
HoT during pulls and after = 10g
---
Definitely bind all the keys immediately around your movement keys. And then all the ones that are within reach of your left hand(unless you're left handed...I don't know your world)
---
I like it.

What item gives stockings? Asking for a friend.

What happened to the census data? In regards to it not working, would it be due to the transfers?
---
Lol, throw away account by too ? Wtf, are you 12 ?
---
Everyone rolled need in the end so the roll was fair anyway?
---
I clearly meant need roll as you very well know.
---
Ohhhh!!!
---
You can learn Screech at level 16. Tame a carrion bird (fleshripper I think) in Westfall.
---
When I was 13 iplayed retail after cataclysm came out when. I remember getting bored because of how easy it was so I stopped. But I'm really enjoying the challenges of classic this time around and its kept me hooked
---
You need darnassus rep to get this mount?
---
Go through SM during peak hours. When it was quiet I went to southshore, arathi, desolace, menethil harbour and thousand needles. 
---
But between low drop rates, longer spawn times of mobs, other people and horde its way faster doing SM. 
---
Average groups can go up about 4 bars in 20-25 mins
---
I've had this exact conversation with my friend. 
---
Except I actually did clear the bigger packs consistently without taking too much aggro.
---
It's kinda sad that all the "look at my screenshot of zone X" have died down.
---
And that's coming from someone who thought of them as simple circlejerk.
---
Someone's jelly. Can still have a job and be 60 with ease.
---
Ur lucky that you actually found a devilsaur
---
Yeah, I had heard that before but I didn't think anyone was actually sadistic enough to waste 10 minutes of their life to just ruin someone else's life when there's literally no rewards from it.
---
I remember getting into Mount hyjal, worgen place and much more with climbing walls with levitate. Seems like they have fixed it now though  :(
---
This^ one hundred percent this^ with loot like that in a pug you either always roll need or wait to roll to see what the group is doing.
---
Noggenfogger's fine. Mostly medium/high population, rarely full. Only had to queue once, but that was 2 weeks ago. Slightly more Horde players than Alliance according to WoWCensus, but who knows how accurate that is.

How to get to Badlands as Horde from Stranglethorn Vale or Swamp of Sorrow? I am currently in Swamp of Sorrow.
---
Uther's Strength is nice, but it costs upwards if 10g
---
it’a 5% i think
---
I remember pottering around with broken tooth on Vanilla tho long yeah my pets good it attacks fast, but then I’d see other players with ultraviolet raptors or cool looking turtles and be like ah damn broken tooth looks lame.
---
No problem. I recommend getting the Bartender4 addon, a very simple ability bar addon with great flexibility and degree of customization - also super simple and fast keybinding. 
---
Also look into making macros, and perhaps more specifically mouseover macros, for important abilities such as heals or interrupts. Here is a [guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-macros-classic-wow) (admittedly a Priest class guide, but it has some good basic info on macros) which shows how to make simple mouseover macros. As a healer these are invaluable, unless you add in another addon which basically does the same thing as these macros, since it allows you to just hold your mouse pointer over a target / unit frame of a target you want to heal, and then you press the action key on your keyboard to cast the heal. For every target you heal you save 1 click of the mouse when you don't have to select the target thanks to mouseover macros - it may not sound like much, but imagine doing raid healing and casting a heal with a 2.5 second cast over a 5 minute fight. You probably won't be casting the same thing over and over and back to back, but in this theoretical scenario you'd have saved yourself 120 mouse clicks. Also very useful for casting interrupts, dispels etc on targets other than the one you are DPSing or healing.
---
Super awesome and congrats on hitting 60! :D
---
Yeah I noticed that too. Arathi Highlands has changed me from passive to kill on sight
---
That's fair enough, But leveling pretty much is the content in phase 1 for the most part. And i don't view leveling as that much of a pain myself, I can quite happily switch off and grind mobs while watching something on the second monitor.
---
I'm now level 50 (About 4 bars from 51) and i have just over 7 days played since launch, Now granted i had a week off and that play time is quite inflated due to me leaving my character on and using a hotkey to make me not log out with the long queues while i was at work. But i also have my Mining at 247, Eng at 220, First aid at 270, Fishing and cooking at 300.
---
There is plenty to do as you level and that is the game. Maybe my way of gaming is now "old" if you can call it that (Only bloody 30)
---
I'm not going to stop people forming these groups its more the attitude of these groups carrying over into all the situations where they are not needed/wanted. Thats all
---
thats not very cool
---
DKP == drama
---
Which is fine, because that leads to angry posts on Reddit, so I can read retarded shit when Im at work.
---

phew.  still bullshit tho
---
that's a shitty keybind lmao
---
So, what's the most efficient enhancement load out for a shaman levelling, some places say WF 2h or 1h, some places say flame tongue.
---
There is a lot of contradictory information due to pservers I guess, so was just wondering if flametongue is actually decent?
---
Roll with +1. I find dkp to be more for very serius guilds.
---
&gt;	“You killed 120 humans, but only 30 had skulls.”
---
At this point it was an act of mercy. Living without a skull must be something really miserable.
---
He’s got some good points
---
You have to go through Searing Gorge. You are better off flying back to Grom'Gol and taking the zeppelin to UC and going through Arathi-&gt;Wetlands-&gt;Loch Modan. 
---
Unless you are level 50+ or don't care how many corpseruns you have to do.
---
Imaging there drops a BiS epic boe and some shithead „accidentally“ rolls it away from you and  keeps it for himself. I know it wasn’t the case at your example but just imagine dude. No tolerance for shit like that because it happens to often. You ninja‘d the item eben if it was an „accident“
---
Easy. Don't group with mages... EVER!
---
Welcome to arathi alliance scum. Care for a blade in your gut?
---
Your attitude is pretty AIDS. Is this anger because your parents neglected you and you're friendless? So you lash out online? Get some help, broski.
---
Druids get weaker as time goes on because they scale less with gear. Resto druids mainly use innervate and MotW and the FF debuff, none of which are boosted by gear (possibly Tier sets but idk). Otherwise they just get standard +mana and healing items 
---
Feral druids can armor Cap in blues. After that they just get more HP and crit/dodge; these are useful, but compared to warriors who get tons of massive upgrades in each tier eventually allowing them to tank while dual wieldin and their weapons DPS increasing makes them scale insanely hard. With nothing but pre raid BIS druids have much higher threat and survivability than an equally geared warrior (they will always have higher threat, much much higher under all normal conditions ie. The warrior isnt dual wielding TF and Hungering Cold
---
1.12 has most everything being viable, just play what you like. Playing a popular class means more raid slots, and more competition for gear and needing to work extra hard farming to stick out. Less popular classes have less raid slots but get fed tons of gear that nobody else realistically uses and if you know what you're doing can be a great boon
---
Happens every damn time. I’m a warrior too, what are they even afraid of?
---
As affliction, I prefer using Felhunter for interrupt and dispels or Succubus for dps or CC. From my perspective, Imp should only really used in raid tank groups or when there is a high chance of the pet dying to AoE.
---
Exactly, nice and uncluttered
---
It's not very easy, you need to go through searing gorge and burning steppes. Unless you are high level I would run from arathi instead. ( Wetlands -&gt; Loch modan -&gt; Badlands)
---
As prot paladin its all a matter of concentration and using seal of life or wisdom to keep ressource up. So either go ret for more damage or Holy shield for some damage reduktion. But i dont Think u Can keep holy shield up fulltime due to man being reserved for consecration :) 
---
In warrior but my pov
---
Saw a pathetic lvl 41 orc war in Duskwood hiding behind a tree, so charged in and started to play with him, the applaud spam was real, yeah if you cant take it dont dish it out either.
---
I get messages daily asking for ports from UC to ORG or the other way around. People don't wanna spend that valuable time travelling. When they ask how much i charge I usually say pay what you can just as long you cover the reagent cost.
---
Had guys with 5g give me 50s for such a short travel
---
Alliance outnumber horde on RP and Normal servers while horde outnumber alliance on PvP servers.
---
This is difficult to answer straight up, as it mostly depends on your talents, your playstyle and how you coordinate with others.
---
Theoretically spirit is the superior stat if people take turns healing with bigger heals and then have a prolongued regeneration-phase outside of the 5-second-window where someone else takes over.
---
Most players don't play that way. If you like spamming heavily downranked heals without a pause, spirit becomes negligible.
---
I'd say that with my personal playstyle their value is about equal with maybe even a slight edge for spirit. But when I look at how many others heal, when I tank for example, I'd say spirit is significantly less valuable on average.
---
A playstyle that uses the full potential spirit needs you to get into some habits, which are very different from retail. Instead of topping people of as soon as they take damage, the take on healing is to only heal when you feel that someone would either die or panic and then do all the healing at once, so you can get out of the 5-second-rule again.
---
I also like to advertise omen of clarity for healing. You have to know which enemies are save to stand next to as a healer and which aint. But getting an omen procc to churn out a max-rank-regrowth for free without interrupting spirit-regeneration is a great feeling.
---
Lol what a douche... I hope you reported him for all the insults :3
---
Thanks, but not really what I was looking for. The old website provided everything at a glance. I'll look further.
---
Oh thank you! Didn’t knew, gonna learn my owl screech then right when I get home! Really thank you soo much!!!
---
Yeah, I'm full Shadow and I've never had any issues healing.
---
Blizzard and Activision are involved, i doubt micro-transactions will stay away for long.
---
What a Chad, made her irrelevant in the matter of seconds.
---
Hey guys, started to play classic as warlock. Can somebody recommend me tallent build for dungeon aoe/any other setup? Currently level 26 full affli, but i want to levelup in dungeons til 60.
---
Tbf, when i get home i only start playing after about 4h after my daughter goes to sleep. So my situation is different in that i dont sit all day on the computer even tho i sit a lot.
---
2 travelers backpacks out of 1 lockbox was pretty cool
---
What Addons are you using? Clean looking UI
---
Honestly though it's okay to leave some things as click only. For example, self buffs, profession tabs, super rare pve spells/abilities while questing. It's all about knowing where to put the binds on the moves you know you will need.
---
I like the black borders around your spells is that custom ?
---
Well, how IS your vagina feeling? These are the important questions!
---
Also: RP 
---
We headed a big RP project on Drachenfels and there were some interesting uses for Spirit Speak.
---
TFW i see the picture and i know it's Zandalar Tribe! This is Classic when you can recognize faces!
---
Great response, thank you.
---
Yeah, we can only play for such a short time that we are only playing to play with each-other. If my friends stop playing, I do too. 
---
Are they making good choices with Shaman (healer/dps) and Warrior (tank/dps)
---
6 gold for 10 levels just isn't worth it when you have to consider your mount. Especially when you have to buy more abilities as an ele than you do as enhance.
---
Ahhh, the great outdoors!
---
publicity stunt to make himself more money.
---
&gt;And for 5 mans, they lack a normal resurrection spell, unlike all other healers. Which is a bit of an annoyance, and could result in them being turned away unless someone else has a rez.

2h faster lieveling is 60g goldfarm at 60
---
People pay 1g for uc/org ports all day, it's really common. Zep still takes forever, and at 60 1g is chump change.
---
I understand you're trying to be nice before you log off but...
---
1G a port. Get more money, compensate yourself for free ports at the end of a dungeon. This is just the law of the land.

You are not my supervisor.
---
I'm looking for a good bread and butter solo leveling paladin spec. I've read a lot of different opinions on efficient builds for Paladins. Is deep ret really that bad? I'm currently level 30 and not fussed about tanking or healing while leveling, just want to be able to hold my own out in the world and kill mobs effectively!
---
Used your pet to bait out the fart cloud
---
That's the thing, I don't want to go to a low pop because I want to be able to find people to quest with. My server is Alliance-heavy but still has enough Horde for me to find groups to do dungeons and elite quests with. I'd rather get ganked but be able to do dungeons than not get ganked and basically play Classic as a single player RPG.
---
Ideally, I'll just transfer to a PvE or RP server when the paid transfers become available.
---
I am a healer not a tank and I thoroughly disagree. I pull threat with heals under certain circumstances with no fault in tank's play.
---
Tanking classic is hard, accept it.
---
Ah shit! Well at least I can quit stressing about the shoulders now. At least I have Kinetic Amice, though the Mantle would have been much nicer!
---
This sounds a bit condescending... but its just the truth. Tactical Mastery is just hands down the best talent in the game for any Warriors but pure MTs
---
You mean I walked all the way to badlands from hillsbrad when I could have just paid some mage to port me there? 
---
wtf
---
Good luck with that :3
---
I was the opposite, got hide by chance so built the chest
---
Where did you grind that from
---
......gimme a sec, rolling a mage bank alt.
---
I'm leaning towards this opinion myself. Anything that anyone (or most) can craft will likely go down in price over time, whereas BiS BoE stuff from dungeons, rare drops especially, might become more expensive as people get richer - since those are not as guaranteed as things most crafters have access to. It's still possible the prices of crafted stuff have not peaked, that's too early to say as the economy is still very much in spin. 
---
Twink items are probably also getting more pricy, since they're still quite rare drops and fewer people will be leveling up or farming low level content where such items can drop.
---
Without enchants Peacemaker has 6AP more then Dal’Rends. With enchants you get 4 AP more from Dal’Rs. That is a very minor difference. Both provide +1% critt. And Peacemaker is a 20% drop chance of the first boss of strat service gate. So much easier to farm. It won’t be contested by warriors, rogues and paladins. And regarding replacement. It will be replaced instantly by Rhok’Delar and Lok’Delar.

I did couple of world quests. My friend started it recently and he's talking about it all the time and apparently enjoying leveling so I got curious. I have two 120 characters I leveled at some point but quit BFA soon after.

Also quite neat image subject.

CLASSIC BAD. RETAIL OFF THE SCALE BAD.
---
Thus finally shutting everyone up that ever said that naxx was the hardest raid ever.
---
Damn... I can only imagine the Feeling to finally get the PC going after countless hours of work. Hiding it and saving Money for it.
---
Sounds like you had a great time back then and all that achieved just by your dedication and hard work. Gratz - you deserve those memories!
---
All I remember is watching my brother Play. I was 11 back when it released. It was the best Thing when my brother let me run his character or kill a few Mobs when he was out of the house :P
---
I know I just did the annoying work for him most of the time but I had a blast doing it. 
---
Some fond memories there :)
---
You dont really need a spesific talent spec for aoe grinding as Lock. You Just use eye of kilrogg, reign of fire and standard hellfire. Int and stam on gear is nice
---
I would go draintank for soloing, Dive has a guide for it. It will be extremely boring to aoe grind the whole way
---
Encountered a lvl50 mage doin ZF who wanted to do this, guess he was exp farming. Guy spammed gogogo every 10 seconds and actually called us noobs when we wiped to too big of a pull. Didn't even know people used that term any more
---
Ive tested that with concecration and holyshield u can cast ruffly 10 of both in a fight with the manapool i have currently and no fight should take more than 80-100secs anyway but this causes me to go oom and having downtime, such Will slower my farming speed.
---
With retaura i certainly kill abit faster but am usually forced to heal at some point and have had Times where i pull around 8-12 and have to bubble just to heal.
---
This results to downtime as well tough cant deside wich is More efficent.
---
Play on pve server ?
---
When I am not tanking myself thats exactly what I am doing. The tank doesnt need to have aggro of every single mob. Arms warriors wearing plate are perfectly capable of offtanking a mob.
---
&gt; n an ideal world, you use "Greed" when you just want to sell it and "Need" for actual upgrades.
---
In an ideal world people would understand opportunity cost and no one would "need" tradables.
---
he had the word Dank in his name, along with loads of stupid accents on the letters, should have seen it coming!
---
I just pictured a Paladin bubbling, and instead of Hearthing, writes, " almost there, keep going."
---
I got more social experience levelling from 1 to 60 in classic than i did on retail since patch 3.3.0. And i played all expacs.
---
This is how it works with AOE dungeons.  
---
I am Druid Healer and had a group for SM.  
---
1 Warri, 1 Hunter, 1 Rouge, 1 Mage and Me.  
---
The warri did only whirlwind, the mage only AOE and pulling 6 mobs everytime.   
---
After every pull I was completly OOM and started drinking. I had about 40% Mana and these guys pulled the next 6 mobs.
---
They told me that I am to stupid to heal. Now the Warry and the Mage is on my ignore list.
---
Short version: he acts like an idiot, pretends he speaks for the classic community and spreads the Twitch chat cancer outside of it.
---
Even then, I'm sure there's some reason they can think of to switch stances. 
---
Although I definitely didn't mean it to be condescending. It's just *that good* a talent.
---
Nice update! thank you &lt;3
---
Yes but warrior is Tank/dps split, however mages, contrary to their belief, cant tank
---
Nice epiphone semi hollow (assuming semi)!
---
Me but auto attacking on my paladin
---
You're sure you're not using retail versions for some or all of them, right?
---
Follow the normal Need/Greed rules, and shame the people if you dont honor it.
---
I upvoted &lt;3
---
Psychopath.
---
Are you getting the classic versions and not retail or vanilla?
---
popularity, persona, income from gaming etc. ;)
---
So, is the Baron mount legit or layer abuse?
---
If it's legit that is way more impressive.
---
slowly transition. just play less and less over the next two weeks until he I ahead or otherwise occupied and then come back an he wont be interested anymore.
---
It just looks identical to me, though I haven't checked.
---
3 silver is a lot for Linen. People make 2-5 silver on Silk making bandages.
---
Agility enchants aren't ingame atm. So might as well give dal rends to warriors and rogues who benefit not just from the stats but from the weapondamage too.
---
Depends, where are you farming?
---
Lolol
---
I landed at org FP and cast a 10 minute buff, and when I finally entered UC the buff was just ending. So I'll happily pay some mage 50-60s to save me 10 minutes of bullshit
---
The Shadoweave Mask is not taught by a trainer. They give you a 3 part questline in the searing gorge to do. It's a level 50 questline which makes it a little hard for people around lvl 44 when you would first get the mask though. Having someone else make that piece at least would make things a lot easier even if you did want to make the rest yourself.

Does hitbox size persist through Druid shapeshifting?

I usually say I'll give a nice tip. Then proceed to tip 69s 69c
---
What is the ZF graveyard farm?
---
If you’ve got a bunch of mana classes pulling it sounds like you must be super slow to the draw. You should be pulling as soon as everyone is 70% mana and drinking.
---
OP’s post relevant AF.
---
&gt; There arent major mechanical and gameplay changes between the two. Just quality of life and convenience.
---
Excuse me, what? Not sure if serious.
---
Go on battlenet and check your parental controls. I've seen numerous people that didn't have the shop button and it was because parental controls were blocking it.
---
With taunt being on a low cd + having mocking blow, it didn't matter to me that I lost threat on him for a short while every now and then. How am I supposed to show you a video of it? Would require me to level a new warrior and do it again. It's really nothing special - if your dps gets aggro, they can run to his initial position and kite him easily. Similar to how you can kite Razorgore. 
---
So many people in this threat are making it sound like tanking dungeons in vanilla, particularly as arms, is insanely hard, whereas I've been disapppointed at how faceroll it is. 
---
Kornstalx also said that I'm "dead fucking wrong" that you can easily tank all dungeons as arms, even though it takes 1 minute to prove that it's easy and literally everyone is doing it. 
---
Up to you if you believe it or not. If you don't, it's likely because you have some serious l2p issues.
---
Just make sure you grab flight paths while on the way for later!

BoE Blues and Epics always get Need rolled.

Level 58-60. What things are efficient to do while still leveling instead of at 60? Things I have came up with so far:
---
* Mark of Fording quest chain (warrior)
---
* MC Attunement
---
* Farming epic chest + Hoj in BRD so I dont have to set my foot in there again
---
* Would it be possible to plow through Onyxia attunements up until UBRS is needed?
---
* More suggestions please!
---
Those will only help you in certain 1v1-3v3 situations, they won't do as much in a massive battle in a bg for instance. Also an orc is still dead vs a warlock and undead still gets wrecked by rogues so racials aren't as important as people make them out to be.
---
I made my little brother farm for me as well when I left the house haha, and thanks!
---
This is why I dont know if I can continue this game. The saltiness from losing rolls sucks, I honestly dont know how my younger self dealt with it.
---
That's solid for that level.
---
Odd.  Looks like you got that one backwards.
---
BLASSIC RETAD, GETAIL BOOD
---
screw you mccool is a treasure
---
You’re just straight lying about those #s.
---
Super inflated and there’s no way they reflect reality, unless you’re counting every green item as worth 20g on the AH.
---
Does rogues talent "Ruthlessness" grant the chance per combo point spent or flat per finisher?
---
You mean Killsbrad WWIIhills. ;)
---
Hate this addon but it’s very popular on RP Servers. It legit feels like a wall hack.
---
Why have one main when you can have 8 ALTs.
---
Upgrades an upgrade imo, goes both ways though. If someone wants to pass due to being an bigger upgrade for someone else thats just +karma, which I usually end up doing anyways :/.
---
Once you're L32ish hit up STV during non-peak hours. Hillsbrad is good for a level. You can go desolace in early 30s too but the kodo gy can be rough.
---
At 30 you can still finish up duskwood.
---
&gt;But yes, your time on a video game is very worthwhile and i'm sure you're having the most fun.
---
Obviously "having fun" is a worthwhile thing. Looking for people to run a dungeon with is not fun for me.
---
I’d say for things like this blizzard dosnt care. This is literally not affecting the game in any bad way
---
Always agree to need not greed.
---
Ashbringer seems a fairly well balanced server, in some zones it actually feels like alliance outnumber the horde. Max queue times are 25 mins during peak hours.
---
Yeah, saw a Druid have so much fun with feral in a dungeon, been thinking starting an alt. :(
---
Join Dragon's Call if you are interested in learning German too :P
---
Looking forward to getting into a little world PvP myself. I didn't care for it much back in the original vanilla days, but I'm currently leveling with a buddy and his girlfriend which means we're always traveling in a pack. Trying to get another friend to play as well who historically loves PvPing, which would be a great sense of added security.
---
I watched him quit a bit, and I honestly have no idea how you can think he claims to speak for the classic community.
---
The why not would be lack of support for your back.
---
This is how I play, it rules. 6.5 feet from a 75" TV, keyboard on my lap and mouse on the seat next to me. Very comfortable
---
Noggen is awesome. Slightly more hired but they all seem pretty shit at pvp so far, if that helps.
---
The irony :P pretty sure the others have it way worse. And what you faced in that 1 instance is more of a counter reaction to the whole aoe xp runs spam that only accept mages and sometimes 1 warlock.
---
Those same groups that end up with all mages raging and leaving if 1 pull goes wrong because xp/hour is taking a hit.
---
You are literally complaining about a problem created by mages that normal people had enough of it and didn’t want any part of it anymore.
---
I personally played warlock, and since level 25 (i am now 60) after seeing my brother (plays rogue) getting denied group invites because “we want mages and warlocks for aoe xp grinding”, I never join any group who is only inviting mages and locks or worse those people who abused raiding dungeons for fast xp before it got patched.
---
I am not saying you personally are one of those people who only accept aoe xp grind runs. But you are complaining about getting denied once, when every dps class/spec are getting denied an invite because they are not a mage and we want a certain xp/hour number, we can't be slowed down. (especially during the lvl 30+ SM, ZF grinds).
---
No changes

This guy must work for a political campaign in real life.
---
what purpose does bandicam even serve any more? Both nvidia and AMD have this functionality in the drivers. And afaik Windows 10 has screen recording built in as well.
---
So you either 1, belive him and get to reply, or 2. dont belive him and then are excluded from the thread\`?
---
If changing position isn't supported, I can live with just a profile with different keybinds.
---
The big one to note is that hunters will fall off after aq drops and warriors/mages/rogues/warlocks  will continue to scale relentlessly.
---
I think he's referring to the adaptive sync refresh rate.
---
Just play retail?
---
Or he could have a modifier..?

Mark of the Chosen from a Maraudon quest
---
I really want to lvl up as prot and do some tanking but the constant need to drink after every mob is tiring :(
---
It only shows created characters, not online stats, that why I wrote "approximate realm stats".
---
I've always wondered just how these guys are actually able to talk.
---
What's numlock? RP walk?
---
As a shaman is there any way to see or illustrate the ways that my totem buffs, such as Windfury weapon, are helping group members? Either in terms of group dps added or something like that?
---
Why make two mages and not roll a different class? 😊
---
Is there anything you do better technically than console port,? Maybe you could upstream it.
---
&gt;Nah, I'm keeping the pull rate slow for healer. Been watching his mana and he's perfect at around 3 at a time. 
---
Said no melee ever.
---
why?
---
The difference between Bear Form and *DIRE BEAR FORM*.
---
Ugh, I have a lot of people from Norway and Finland in my guild, Grumpy old Gamer, but we're on Mirage Raceway. We're English speaking though.
---
really nice, thank you!
---
is there a way to add reeling in the fish to the same button so I can cast and reel with spacebar or something? the right clicking really annoys me
---
We would praise him for his finding in the cure of cancer. But we would spit on him for his “I’m WoW Classic “ like he is the senate way of talking. He is not Palpatine, he cannot do that.
---
Why do you have 2 of the same class, if you don't mind me asking. For grinding/multiboxing?
---
Pff bumping in to someone at the bar does not cost the person time and effort.   
---
More like accidentally running someone over with the car, so they have to take time off work to see a doctor. Then yeah i get why some people might send threats.
---
2 character at max lvl.. I dont know man you have a lot of free time.
---
No I think mythic raids, plus, a rated PvP system is more challenging.
---
The questing experience may be more difficult in classic, but that experience is for casual players.
---
Warrior if you want to spam whirlwind and constantly replace players in your group for 12-36 hours per dungeon till you know the precise pixels of each dungeon. Mage if you want to do the exact same route in half the time.   
---
If you play on a low pop server there is not much difference however as you can just quest. Warriors arent hard to quest with just a bit slower, but on high pop servers where you need to compete for mobs the difference is huge between the two.
---
If I remember correctly from the recent posts on classic, the end boss is level 48.
---
They have to be careful with expansions. Leaving the two continents is a bad idea that splinters the community and begins to recreate the sins of retail expacs. The focus should be on adding new zones to the territory we already have. Even if high Lv players taxi to them, people on the ground can still see that there are people in the world. It's engagement, even if it's minor.
---
If everyone just moves on to Outlands/Northrend/whatever, that is lost and Azeroth becomes emptier and devoid of player interaction.
---
Increasing the level cap is also bad - it hurts PvPers and people who cannot play often, encouraging more "gogorush" playstyles. People will stop taking the time to enjoy the game and socialize.
---
Progressive/lateral itemization is also bad for similar reasons. The ideal us horizontal progression, offering new set &amp; item bonuses to make more specs &amp; playstyles viable without ruining the experience for most.
---
First thing I did was rebind that key to e. Fuck touching my numpad for something that common.
---
Cat-Druid takes some time to pick up for doing damage. A lot of rather important skills are only obtained at above level 30.
---
They are decent for single-target-damage. For multiple targets you actually can do more damage in bear by spamming swipe. Bear in Cat-gear and with the talent that gives you extra-rage on crits isn't all that bad actually.
---
Tanking on the druid is really easy. Easier than warriors I would say. Thorns gives you some free and sustained AoE-aggro. Swipe helps to hold several targets. And for single-target-tanking you basically have to press just one button.
---
I'd say warrior is more enjoyable to tank with simply because there's more things to do, like active mitigation, reactive-skills, better debuffing. But you don't play a druid to just tank. You play it because it can do everything.
---
The main advantage of the class is also their survivability in PvP. No other class can get out of dangerous situations like a druid. And ontop of that you have stealth like a rogue so you can pick your fights and avoid getting corpse-camped.
---
What a brave and original post.
---
He worded it weirdly but he got a portal FROM badlands and TO Ogrimmar
---
I’m working on my alt too, I have a 60 mage and currently 32 warrior, but why 2 mages? Why not a new class??
---
it does but it’s less effective than you d think 30% would do. It’s still a requirement tho if you are playing void spec.
---
What happened?
---
and here I am still at 28 with my warrior lolz
---
This is a fantastic list! I'll definitely share this with a buddy of mine who started playing. He never played vanilla WoW and, even though he's enjoying it so far, he seems a bit dismayed at the lack of some quality of life stuff that didn't come until after vanilla. A few of these addons should help him out.
---
I hit 60 at 7 days as a rogue, there are rogues that hit 60 at sub 5 days. Its less about class and more about optimising your leveling.
---
there’s a workaround if you can only get win 10. if you get 7 or 8 i’d still available you can proceed. but if you can only get windows 10 then you have to follow these instructions to a T. don’t skip anything https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/3fjyn2/install_windows_10_with_boot_camp_drivers_on_old/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body

Nnnnooooooooooo...!
---
Thanks I like it. How do I make my windows look like that?
---
I'll check on a minute!
---
*Tips Fedora*
---
I found the same book in my neighbors garage at a tag sale.
---
&gt; and another time throwing out some decurses.
---
Safe to say you're one of the better mages then.  I'm constantly yelling at them while healing to decurse because I can't.  
---
Mages really have been the spaz class that pulls and bitches at the tank more than any other in classic, but that's just my anecdotal experience.  A lot of them seem to think that threat mechanics don't apply to them because they can frost nova, without realizing that means most of the threat is going on me and not the tank.
---
Honestly a huge huge part of this is because of Jokerd. There are SO many wannabe streamer heroes out there thinking they are the gods og AOE grinding and knows everything about all. But they have absolutly no idea what they are doing and knows nothing about anything.
---
Im playing a Mage myself and doing a bit of everything while having fun, but a great hobby is going to the AOE places Jokerd used and watch 90% of the mages absolutly fuck up everything they do.
---
But also when people search Mages for AOE grind in dungeons, its about being fast and effective and a hell of alot of tanks do not know how to do this and actually gets mad if Mages get aggro from AOE. The whole point is that the tank pulls and then the Mages will get aggro, but Blizzard slows so much that actually noone takes dmg if it is done right.
---
After the pull Literally ALL tanks has to do is get aggro from/interrupt caster mobs and get aggro from that one mob that resists frost nova.. But this just dosent happen like ever and the tanks blames the Mages for AOEing too fast or too much.
---
Oh yeah thanks for pointing that out. I completely misread that.
---
Ya, when ya tell him who to insult he asks you what movie rating you want your insults at (G, PG, PG-13, R, X). I heard him do an X one for a woman. Hes def got that too, haha.
---
this isn't about hitting 60 though.. its about hitting 60, getting exalted with darnassus and completing a 200 hour grind all within 30 days of the game releasing.
---
Please don't do this if you're new. It'd suck to spend your days inside the same place over and over.
---
I am using an addon, but trying to learn for myself haha. Price goes up with armour type, but I'm stuck on weapons. Two handed gives more money than one handed, but that's as far as I've gotten. And shields are a crapshoot.
---
Drop rates also suck, but that's part of "the experience"^TM , so it's not on my complaints list.
---
Sounds usefull if you want to bot for gold. 
---
For me it seems ... a bit fishy
---
Hell no, I wanna see my big chunky numbers... or my small fast ones!
---
Crit
---
For perspective, 20g an hour at max level isn't too shabby.
---
The puny alliances simply dwindles in numbers as the superior faction steamrolls them throughout Azeroth. Don’t expect a peaceful grind if you’re on my server. Lok’tar ogar!
---
On my lock I wear the robes and cloak, but not the hood. I don't want to look like some kenny-like
---
Bro? Is that you? Wait there is only one way to know.
---
Finish the sentence: That is one thicc "...."
---
Well, no. But it will definitely last until you want tier 2 set bonus or beyond..
---
To my knowledge ret IS the go-to solo leveling spec, unless you want to do aoe shenanigans from your mid 30s. I'm specced 31 points into ret myself, just started to get holy talents.
---
I guarantee you won't have any problems, with a little preparation and your big cds you are even capable of soloing elites. You won't be the fastest killer, but one of the most reliable for sure.
---
It will be a combination of both if economy develops like on private servers. 60 BiS items will hold a pretty steady price but meanwhile your \[Insert trade goods here\] will start selling for more and more as gold become less valuable, thus making the Devilsaur set cheaper (but cost the same number of gold).
---
I'm lvl 41 now, and I regret not working on cooking. So many quests give recipes that I have just vendored. 
---
Can I catch up or is it infeasible to start now?
---
Idk what server you play on but as a horde player. If I see alliance regardless of level or group size, I attack. FOR THE HORDE!
---
CLSIC GUD RTEEL NOT SO GUD
---
Crit for sure as you'll most likely be spamming flash of light
---
&gt; Mages I usually see go flamestrike -&gt; frost nova -&gt; cone of cold and then run around like headless chickens spamming arcane explosion.
---
Sounds like you got some scrubs in there. Much more effective to use Nova --&gt; Flamestrike + CoC for double the Shatter procs. Wouldn't exactly help your situation though!
---
&gt; They inevitably pull aggro (i mean, what tank can really expect to hold threat against that?), 
---
Aye one needs to heavily consider the timing of when to apply such tactics. If I'm unsure (but feel like we need AoE for some reason) I'll do Flamestrike + CoC and the Nova afterwards. Usually keeps most mobs in place for long enough. 
---
&gt; and then iceblock because they are getting killed.
---
I never understood that behaviour. Why not just simply run away from the mobs for a bit (since they are slowed), then blink towards the tank (you run for a bit so as to not blink right into the mobs). Not that this is optimal behaviour, but simply Iceblocking won't solve anything (which you also pointed out). I fully understand the frustrations from many people regarding Mages. Just keep in mind that good Mages can actually put in a decent amount of AoE without pulling massive threat in certain situations (even with a full pack of elites). 
---
Oh, and pulling AOE aggro when the tank has pulled a large pack before the healer has any mana is a valid strategy to save the group!
---
I think people who dislike Asmongold just preach their own agenda of who he is, and then new people hear that and take it as the truth. Like I can see reasons to dislike him, but most haters have a completely different idea of who he is.
---
Also currently resources are more abundant due to layering. Once everyone is in 1 layer the resources available will be fought over by more people.
---
I actually had a lot of fun making the most cringy/ridiculous/generic thumbnail ever haha, I was thinking of making a tutorial for them.
---
Innervate scales with the spirit of the person who you cast it on.
---
Also I'd say resto-druids mainly use healing-touch, which scales with gear quite significantly.
---
Yep these ones. I cringe each time I see one of these still in use.
---
The looting can be fixed with an addon.
---
Layering is bad because it has allowed for terribly overpopulated servers. These servers have such high populations that when layering is removed in phase 2 we are going to have truly insane server queues.
---
People will be forced to take free server transfers and they communities will be divided.
---
Other than that I don't give much of a shit about layering. I even find it useful sometimes.
---
“Hurr my personal opinion is fact bc reasons”
---
People forget you don’t have to buy things
---
I feel for other classes who have to spend way more than us warlocks. Not sure why Blizz allowed that. I will keep an eye out around lv 40 If made 100g so I can say I could have bought it like the other classes aswell.
---
[Laughs in Warlock]
---
Classic isn’t hard just time consuming, but fuck retail
---
I don't think I hated any class in retail as much as I hate mages in Classic
---
Is elemental not better on a troll than an orc?
---
Ele spec sounds good but am I better off on a troll than an orc for berserking?
---
no you clearly haven't raided mc yet
---
Thank you for downloading it!!
---
I would delete them. Download everything again. And put them in one at a time and test. Until you find the culprit which is clashing with your addons.
---
I like it. Another application could be doing 2 raids a week with a class you enjoy playing. I did that in retail during Wrath but never again.
---
True. I just have limited time to play and If the goal is to reach 60 I should focus on one toon. But i rather just have fun 😀
---
700g on my server
---
Don't let the kind words fool you. She will sap you and steal your mount!
---
What i would pay for tho would be some1 that had an account of opposite faction to track down ppl who ganked me so i could find them and kill them.
---
Yeah, my priest has +120 healing atm and 4k mana, basically all lvl appropriate blues. The main problem is there is never an available gap of time to start that mana regen. Its feels crippling honestly haha
---
Maraudon has three wings, purple, orange and "princess". The first two have separate entrances but are connected inside the dungeon, and both lead towards the third. Once someone in the group has done the necessary quest (requires killing bosses in orange and purple) you can use the scepter to create a portal to bypass the first two wings and go directly to the last one with the final few bosses.
---
Common runs are "quest" or "full" runs, where you do all three wings and essentially clear the dungeon and acquire the scepter, and "princess" runs, where someone in the group has the scepter and you just do the last wing repeatedly (which bosses in there are killed then is up to discussion, most groups will kill side bosses only if someone needs something from them). 
---
Mobs in the orange/purple wings are like 45-48, so well within your range. The last wing has mobs 50+, so while you can probably still do it, the group will get slowed down significantly due to your lack of damage and large body pull range. Quest/Full runs are probably more likely to take you along than quick princess rush runs. Personally I'd wait to 48 for a smoother experience.
---
Icy Veins might've confused it with Relentless Strikes. Relentless strikes 1/1 gives your finishers a 20% chance per combo point to restore 25 energy.
---
Ruthlessness (1/3, 2/3, 3/3) gives your finishers a 20/40/60% chance to add a combo point to your target.
---
The point is it is not advertised as a AOE cleave group but people take it upon themselves to try and turn it in to one. 
---
If it's advertised as such then there is no issue
---
Listen. You're taking this entirely too seriously
---
This is wow classic
---
While he is an asshole for taking the item, you are an asshole for flaming him nonstop.
---
Just move to sweden and that IS how it works. Sure, you won't get much unless you're a muslim but enough to survive and play wow. I don't know how it works now because I don't know anyone living of welfare money but 8 years ago or something I had a friend living of it and all you had to do to get your welfare money was to leave like 5 job applications/month and if you didn't want a job, you just sent your applications to way overqualified jobs because they didn't care what job you applied for, just that you did.
---
Anyone tried this on a Tauren? How difficult is it too sustain?
---
Some guy walked off the boat while 3 bros got super hyped about it, and you and I both lost 15 seconds of our lives
---
lost me at (alliance obviously)
---
i might make a new class in the future, haven't decided yet but i think either warlock, priest or even a rogue :) for now i'm gonna continue farm prebis items for this one. i already got mc and onyxia attunement completed before i hit 60
---
Just search "Todochecklister" or get it here https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/todochecklister
---
Looking for some profession advice.  Just dinged 38 as a Priest, sitting at roughly 200 tailoring / 185 enchanting and I'm broke as can be.  I've only been training skills I have to have and I'm sitting at 30g before training any 38 skills.
---
Was thinking I could use tailor/de to grind tailoring with cloth drops then DE to AH the ingredients when I don't need them to boost my enchanting.
---
Thinking of dropping enchanting for a gathering skill, maybe Herbalism or Mining.  Is it too late?
---
Hyalp.
---
Uh huh, stopping to get mana sure is a basic bitch move. Also god forbid if any of them got aggro if they ran to my giant yellow aoe to get the aggro taken off. I was and still am salty about the fuckers.
---
Pahaha I thought that might you horde scum ;)
---
Dude pushing 1 button for 45 minutes says you're bad at your job, that shit must hurt.
---
I’m alliance on heartseeker:(
---
Gnome rogue + world enlarger engineering item = teensy, teeeeeensy gnome
---
Add on that a potion (can't recall its name) that DOES actually stack with world enlarger, and you'd be really difficult to spot in PvP.
---
Don't trust these cowards my man. The only time they good is when it's not unfair, second you got your back turned they're on it
---
the forbidden mount
---
Funnily enough, I’m lvl 42 and have managed to only be ganked twice in STV (both warriors executing me while on low hp versus some mobs), playing mainly solo as well. 
---
I generally stay away from angry looking parties, and will give solo players a /salute and help split camps of mobs with them. Pvp server doesn’t mean you can’t cooperate a lil ;)
---
Where did I mention anything about my own leveling time?
---
I've always used &lt; and Shift + &lt; for autorun and mount respectively. Also have a secondary binding for autorun to Mouse 4 to enable effective 1-handed gameplay (in case my other arms is kidnapped by either the cat or wife).
---
I used to think need before greed. But i got burned back in vanilla. I even bought the BoE back to wear like a real looser. 
---
Since then i always roll need.
---
Is there any point in investing into getting leveling gear from instances as a Hunter? I'm at lvl 35 and completed 6 instances so far, but the only worthwhile equipment I got from them are the Westfall chestpiece and the Gnomeregan pants, both of them are quest rewards. I feel like spending hours on completing instances while only the casters and tanks get 90% of the good gear has slowed down my progress significantly while not giving any proper reward.
---
BoE's are a touchy subject. Every server did them differently, and now everyone is all mixed together with different ideas of how people SHOULD roll.
---
I find that a good tank will respect what I say as the healer about pacing, but a great tank will just naturally figure it out.  I'm going to drink into the pull, because it's more efficient for the group.  That doesn't mean you need to wait.  But if I'm drinking and still under half mana, you should probably wait if it's more than 2 enemies.
---
Why is alliance obvious? And why is your server name not obvious?
---
lol I got triggered af
---
I second this. Dreadmist is offering a very vanilla experience, with a few at max lvl but most of the people engaging with each other, taking it slow. I cant complain. Join us ( im on horde )
---
Every group I've been in, thus far, goes by the following:
---
Need - It's an upgrade, and your going to equip it.  (even if you can't equip it right away, because your 1+ levels under the minimum level to equip)
---
Greed - Your going to sell it on the AH, or disenchant it.
---
Needing on an item to sell on the AH, gets you on my blacklist!
---
In an ideal world nobody should need on things to sell for gold as that's what the greed function is for.
---
Unfortunately, the reality is you cannot trust other people with valuable goods - is the person who "needs" it actually going to use it? Is someone going to be an opportunist and roll need on it after everybody rolls greed for an easy payday? Does that person who says "I'm an Alchemist!" when a flask recipe drop already have the recipe and wants to pocket the change?
---
Ultimately, you can't trust other people with valuable items so it makes sense to give everybody an equal shot at every valuable by needing in order to limit someone taking an opportunity to fleece an entire party of a chance at a hefty sum.
---
The best solution is to state before a run, or even better when advertising, "BOEs = ALL NEED".
---
MR CHAMBERS!  MR CHAMBERS!  DON'T GET ON THAT SHIP!  THE REST OF THE BOOK...IT...IT'S A COOKBOOK!
---
I too decide to sacrifice fun for what is optimal in a 15 year old game
---
Nice - and sorry bro i'm on horde, no hard feelings, wasnt me at the camp though i dont do stuff like that, i quest and i kill things!
---
Yeah do that to the normal BoPs and see how long you get into groups.
---
Warriors are a pain to level but really fun at 60 also dont level as prot it hurts trust me i know..

Whell how i play is i look at what was puled and make a gues as to how much damage my tank wil take. Wich i then ajust in the first 5 seconds of combat as i cant heal enyway because i need to let him stack treath. Then i heal the needed amount trying to be efficient with mana.
---
The thing is that as druid we can regen 15% in combat to so seems like spirit is even beter for us.
---
i really dont get the tanks who get annoyed by the mages doing their job, what does it matter if they pull agro  if it means everything dies 3x faster, if you want single target invite rogues.
---
that said i have never had a tank actually complain to me ingame only on this reddit do i see people complain about it so not sure if its just old farts circlejerking on here or if its how tanks actually feel but i constantly see "need mage" over any other dps and never had any complaints about my aoe usage
---
This is one of the things I expected would leak into Classic from Retail.
---
Not just the AoEing... but the rushing to get shit done, and trying to bring the retail/mythic dungeon experience to classic. Not CCing mobs, pulling a shit ton of groups, etc.
---
Didn't know that, thank you!
---
I plan to add this!
---
Zombies need water too.
---
&gt; when the paid transfers become available.
---
Reroll PvE now.  If Blizzard runs things right paid transfers will never become available.  They weren't a vanilla feature, and IMO they ruined the sense of community on a server and they should never have introduced them.
---
Because alliance is alpha obviously...;) And because I have terrible memory and I'm not sure if that is spelt correctly! I am new to this be nice haha
---
"Just taunt it, lol"
---
All my rage
---
I'm lvl40 so I just grind while exploring and looking for the objectives.
---
*angrily upvotes*
---
But that is exactly what you wait from Classic. If you need to kill trolls you have to find them before
---
Super slow my ass, I'd sit down for mana and they'd have pulled again. Or I'd aggro a mob and they'd fucking aggro two more and I'd have to run to them to get the aggro off.
---
Oh there is a reward alright.
---
That's a horde trait ;)
---
Thanks! I'll add this to the OP
---
or 1% hit. Hit cap is 3% and available blue gear provides 2% :'( (Allegedly)
---
I really hope it's more level 60 content. I just want one modern style raid with old-school player mechanics.
---
exactly :)
---
You ok bud? Let the lady share her fun interaction man, it's all good. There is room for everything on here.
---
He doesn’t know, he talking out his ass to make people believe his stupid view
---
sup ninja
---
Lvl 35. 30g. I've sold everything, and I mean EVERYTHING on ah. Green Boe, linen, wool, herbs. I don't Vendor anything that isnt like a mail armor with +str +spirit
---
Where was a show on wowradio with TotalBiscuit and they were talking about funniest names in WoW. One of them was a hunter named Blamethepet with pet named dontblameme. Thanks for reminding me about this awesome show .
---
but surely you cant need something because you want to sell it? All BoE's that i have in my bank ready to sell in phase 2 have all come from lucky greed rolls, you only need if you are going to equip it. The exception is if something drops that is one or two levels above you but you will equip at that level. IMO
---
Same, been on mouse 4 since actual vanilla.
---
There are ways to get close to exalted as any race at any rep faction by doing the correct quests at the correct level. And if im not missing anything, isnt the rest just handing in rune cloth, theres ton of that at AH pretty cheap. So I dont see how it would be that much more difficult on any other class.
---
19 days played on a game that's been out 27 days is a lot of free time I'd say.
---
I'm horde, i dont go fishing for low levels as its really lame, i found the same with alliance though they roam in packs and happy to take the fight when they're out numbering and out levelling their opponent. I think its just a lot of world pvpers prefer an easy fight. I only wpvp against people in my quest zone, either with or without my friends.
---
Lol that's wholesome af
---
That is a fair bit
---
As a healer, that's not my experience at all.  After they kill the dps, they run at me.  That's why it's an even bigger problem that they're doing it in the first place.
---
The completely and utterly imbalanced PvP is "the classic wow content" is as much a part of the classic wow content as the end-game PvE is.
---
Ohhh nice one. Yeah there is a quest to kill that guy for thrall. What server are you one?
---
After rfc there ks WC in the barrens. Be careful with your pet in there, theres a few times you have to jump down things and the pet will potentially aggro mobs taking an alternate route. Wc takes a bit longer too but it has wayyyy better quests and better loot. I know theres a blue staff that you would want on your lock.
---
Like I said specifically, you won't get to touch dungeons or raid content in classic with that playtime, but it still keeps you occupied for over a year. And while you can do 3 to 4 dungeons in retail, you will be pressured into doing dailies first like world quests.
---
Rip for the delete still I'm glad that everyone can enjoy the game
---
When I was in highschool. I was forever plagued with jealousy at my friends who were losing sleep since they moved over to Wow. I only had a computer that could play Diablo 2. A game I wasted just as many hours on..
---
When I finally got round to playing WoW it felt like I was getting a slightly watered down experience compared to them. And playing classic today has really confirmed that. It is a truly magical experience
---
I'd guess more. A lot more. daily
---
Can’t wait till this shit is done for the day and I can go and level. Classic wow is the best wow.
---
Wow the guy leveled 2 mages... Must mean he is fishy and wants to bot for gold!
---
Why you here then
---
The same logic can be applied to any item really, regardless of rarity.
---
You wouldent be pissed if i rolled need on everything, since that gold could be used towards something i really need?
---
I have been looking for this as well and find out this:
---
1) Flametongue sux even on fast weapons - it is better to use rockbitter or WF
---
2) RB is stable DPS so if your RNG sux than it is better than WF (even on very slow weapon) BUT the avarage dmg comparison in long run is comparable. If you are lucky with RNG than WF is better.
---
3) Frost is better than RB or WF if you fight mobs with high armor.
---
4) Note: It looks like that the weapon buffs are quite ballanced. Use what you want.
---
Honestly I did not test it. 
---
I am skilling both 2H and 1H weapon -&gt; I am using worst DPS weapon with RB in wolf form and only while I am leveling cooking/first aid = while killing lower level mobs for ingredients (or gold farm).
---
While questing I am using 2H weapon with WF but only because I enjoy the procs.
---
The issue is when the mage dies and aggro switches to heals :P
---
It still works with sounds as well, replaced the fishing bite sound with a clearer to hear sound and silenced wand sound effects.
---
They are though. Thanks for agreeing with me!!
---
My guide says BIS until p4
---
GREAT comic :D
---
And that's fine for you to do that, but I'm not going to be robbed of hundreds of gold so I can feel morally superior.
---
Using Rank 1 is best for Aggro and Mana purposes!
---
Well I mean to be fair, I'm leveling my two bank alts to 40 because they're also going to be my blacksmiths and leatherworkers, lol (and the priest is the blacksmith)
---
Do you need some evidence?
---
Yes but you have to show the team it has been equiped.
---
and you are responding to month old comment... did it take too long to load the post on overheating macbook?
---
Gotcha
---
Consider the amount of time it takes to move to UC from Orgri without a mount. A couple of minutes to get to the Zepp tower. Oh wait, the Zepp *just* flew away and now you have to wait 5 minutes. Then add a minutes flight time, and a couple of minutes to get into UC itself. You've easily spent 10 minutes doing effectively nothing. I can definitely earn more than 50s in 10 minutes of effective grinding. Which is also why I prefer to mine high-level veins to make money and then spend the money on lower level mats to level my Engineering. 
---
Even if you don't consider the monetary value, consider adults with limited playtime. If I'm only able to be online 1½ - 2 hours a night, 10 minutes is at least 1/12th of the time I have available. I'm not going to want to spend that doing nothing.
---
Nah, but I joined a very good guild(1st week Mc I believe top3 North America)that did on a popular server(skeram)
---
Really it was spell cleaving sm-zf-brd-lbrs didn’t even need a raid just at least 3 mages and a healer.
---
Or because horde is so awful and full of kids they will 10v1 u in any other zone.
---
Naaaah
---
Adding to this, since DoTs cannot crit, affliction sees even less benefit from int items.
---
Erm no I'm good man, what I would like is a guild to join haha
---
You'll get there eventually by questing. Gold rewards should ramp up around that lv. If you didn't allready, make a bank alt und only buy skills you need. You can always buy everything else if you are well off.
---
&gt; The pre raid BIS stuff is so AIDS.
---
I think people will learn pretty quick when they actually start running the 60 instances, it's in your best interest to get the biggest initial jump in gear you can, regardless of whether or not someone put it on the pre raid bis list for your class.  After you have 80% of the stats of the pre-raid bis, as opposed to the 40% you're going to have as an initial 60, then you can make the decision to or not to farm for actual pre-raid bis.  At that point you'll be far enough ahead that people will be glad to take you along because you make the dungeon run easier.
---
Exactly. I tank and it's hard to pull threat from bigger groups because you don't have a aoe spell which binds every month to you. Instead you need to switch targets all the time so every mob hates you the same.
---
They do have a guarantee, you can see if somebody equips the item or not. If the individual in question is an honorful one, they will equip it the instant they win the item. If they refuse to equip it, boot that fucker on your ignore list and shame them all over the server. 
---
Need for use, greed for selling. Easiest, universal rule on every server, unless the group agrees on a different rule.
---
so do you roll need on all BoEs by default just in case somebody else does?
---
Yeah but thats the best part because you just vanish and it pulls aggro onto them, giving you time to eat real quick before going back in
---
There is an addon that shows the lvls on the map.
---
On priest I use shield/shoot macro.
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [harm]shoot; Power word: shield(rank x)
---
Works like a charm.
---
Dont forget it's channeled so you can't run and gun.
---
Your post on a wow sub today: “can you guys post some useful stuff”
---
Your post on a wow sub 259 days ago: “Eat this Mongolian beef muchachos”
---
As a tank there are few things as painful as watching another tank play badly. Did BRD for the Onyxia quest yesterday on my paladin. A warrior whispers he can tank, so I whip out my healer gear. He was lvl60 with about half T0, so I assume it's going to be a cake-walk.
---
He could (and would) only tank one mob at a time. He made absolutely zero effort to tank the rest of any group he pulled. By the end I had healed myself more than him.
---
Never again.
---
More threat on higher ranks, more damage, higher mana cost.
---
What phase will the Agi enchants be? I'm seeing Phase 5 on Classic Wowhead. But that seems very late to me. 
---
But if that is indeed the case. Then Peacemaker is BiS for Hunters.
---
The R word used unironically 
---
Yikes
---
Get to STV
---
If you'd play horde and eu I'd have one
---
As a new player playing mage I don't mind taking it slow and would actually prefer it, these speed runs only confuse me more and I never learn the basics. It's hard for me to find these groups that take it slow as everyone expects me to want to speed aoe.
---
Well, luckily there is no longer a ToS unless they decided to add it back in just for Classic...
---
Yea, technically they can do that, but it's bad business and unethical.
---
Well, I just today made a personal vow to attack all horde mages when there's a nice opportunity to gank them (I would lose in a fair fight being a non-gnome rogue :P ) ... because they will almost always attack me as soon as they see me, even if I'm just running past mounted or such.
---
&gt;The lean more towards the larger playerbase who doesn't have lots of time to dedicate to a single game
---
maybe they want to achive this, but it feels completly opposite. you have to play every single day to keep up and if you dont do that, hf playing alone. and while classic is also a massive time sink, i havent ever gotten the feeling that i absolutly have to login every day to stay with the pack.
---
I wonder whats alpha about being an ordinary human prone to disease and with a life expectancy of 46, nightelfs might aswell all be colorful females, gnomes are just OMEGALUL, dwarves are cool and you literally get hypercarried by those beefy boiz, you eat, shit, sleep, breathe and live ironforge, everything else sucks and is irrelevant.
---
Lol

Nah, stun resist is OP.

Hello Tuesday maintenance

If I see 4 greeds I'll roll greed, otherwise I just wait to see what everyone else does. If one person rolls need I'm rolling need.

---
This is both against the rules and stupid. Enjoy telling your grandchildren old stories about what it was like to breathe oxygen and climb trees at their age.
---
Yeah, its not black/white. What you consider value someone else might consider time wasted.
---
Someone might think that 10% faster for 5 levels is more valuable then gold.
---
Someone else might think leveling their enchantment and rolling need on all greens is the most important part of the game.
---
This  got way deeper than I expected lol
---
Unless you're asking for a place to avoid PvP and want to rush to 40. Which is exactly what OP asked for.
---
So yes, spam SM.
---
Couldn't be, most NPC's are actually useful
---
so you're one step away from being the guy who waits until the end and rolls need, set the precedent, dont lower yourself to it.
---
15 year old me wanted this mount so bad. 32 year old me is laughing at this moron for spending his time doing this shit.
---
&gt; Everyone Just looking Up Guides for "the best class". Idiots
---
Or some people have fallen in love with their Mage since the Classic days and couldn't even consider the possibility of playing another class.
---
I genuinely laughed so much to this hahaha.
---
60/2... carry the 3... yup, you're not even halfway!
---
Oh, so you're so good to know what "real answers" are that you waste time arguing with me instead of giving a "real answer" to him? Where's your "real answer"?
---
&gt; I honestly have no idea how you can think he claims to speak for the classic community.
---
[Here's him completely misrepresenting the community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaDfrRtOD4k) while trying to tell everyone how they should be. The problem is, the "community" is his fanbase. Every server besides his is fine.
---
In Thousand Needles you definitely wanna do Shimmering Flats. The quests are all packed tightly together, mostly kill-loot related, and the beasts drop really profitable vendor trash. I always pick up every quest, grind an entire level there, and then turn them in. Roughly in the 31-34 range, whatever works out.
---
There's rules in a society. You can't tell me you didn't notice that the vast community prefers a need=use, greed=sell mentality. You choose to ignore that and need to live with the consequences, unless you can make the group agree on that beforehand.
---
I do aoe groups with a few guild mates and friends. Besides that I just put regular runs because most people can't figure out kiting.
---
Yes, it's just a game, and if you're so emotionally invested that you come to make death threats to real people over an item then yes you have serious RL issues.
---
Not saying you can't get mad at a game, just that there's a limit.
---

For BoP drops, that's exactly what I'd say to do. For high-value BoEs, it gets admittedly murky.
---
Depends on the auction house on your server.
---
Well, they’re here to stay.  They will never, ever get rid of them because the base auction house is embaressingly archaic and inept.  Game devs have learned it’s tremendously easier to let the modding (in this case, addon) community deal with their unfinished business.
---
I just use blizzards default raid frames and then you can set it to show percent of health, total health left, or health missing.
---
I go with health missing because I can choose which rank of yeah to use without overheating
---
I'll be honest, I'm a pretty good warlock but I don't know shit about most other classes lmao. I'm just regurgitating the stuff my friend told me because he actually is an extremely good player and knows a ton about the game, so I trust his opinion. 
---
Just out of curiosity, what do shamans do to counter paladins?
---
Same, just watching youtube or something; fun to watch them waste their time and wait for a respawn
---
Big true, as a tank I actively avoid grouping with them unless I have to.
---
Just yesterday several of my guildies were talking about dragging extra mobs through mage aoe and getting the mages killed. It sucks to be targeted but a lot of the blame can go to weeks of “LF2M MAGES CATH SPELLCLEAVE! MAGES ONLY!!!”
---
Good ol' Winamp.
---
Because it's watermarked???
---
wow those are like 250-350g on my server
---
Makes me want to make a mage and just sit in chat all day making free food and buying teleport runes with tips.
---
Made me chuckle
---
I'd just like to leave some points about Rogue behavior aswell:
---
- Rogues should be the ONLY class allowed ahead of the tank, for Pickpocket or Sap, or simply scout (if the group is unaware of the dungeon layout or spawns)
---
- Rogues should be able to handle tanking 1 mob, maybe even 2 with Evasion CD up. The weird part comes when the rogue has to dump his threat however, as it's very possible the Healer is their next target, not the tank. If it's a big pull, don't let the Rogue taking damage distract or panic you, just keep the mobs away from the healer once the rogue has to feint/vanish. The rogue can usually take care of the not dying part.
---
- Rogues rely on combo points, and every point has alot of energy investment. When a rogue switches target, all combo points are immediately lost, which means all the energy (and time) invested is completely wasted. (200 energy for 5 CP with improved SS). If a rogue is currently building up on a mob and the tank pulls in a new top priority target, they can - but should'nt switch targets until they have used their combo points or it's absolutely vital for the groups immediate survival.
---
Funny.  But I see a lot of people who have played retail also either ignoring that "the journey is the fun" stuff (AOE cleave spam and such) anyways, or the ones complaining about things being so damn long so they can get to the "good" part.
---
Sad, really.
---
But if the tank pulls more than 1 mob and you want to pickpocket them all you need it bound separately.
---
Tanking is the least understood role in the game. It's not as intuitive and self explanatory as damage and healing.
---
The importance of the tank pulling, getting initial aggro, building threat, maintaining threat on multiple targets, the fact that taunt has a cooldown and limited range, and that AoE taunt has a 10 minute cooldown, what a "line of sight" pull is, kill priorities, marking targets, Little things like that are not common knowledge and need to be reiterated very often.
---
In a good group everyone understands what everyone else is doing.
---
I don't get it. Can someone explain?
---
I remember getting the burning war axe off the auction house back in BC for 25 gold. My dad had to lend me gold to buy it. 
---
I then proceeded to FUCK up some paladin with just melee attacks in Arathi Basin right after my hunter equipped it. 
---
Good memories.
---
For some reason I have to be within 20 yards of a target for the over the head healthbar to even show up. Kinda sucks when I'm standing at max range and want to easily swap targets. Could be my addons effecting that?
---
&gt; Mages. Your portals and food/water is as much a service as a priest buff.
---
And we have our own equivalent, the Mage buff, which are handed out for free. Terrible comparison. It's actually been the way it is for *years and years*, both on live and private servers and not many people complain. 
---
Furthermore, you *do* realize that Portals actually cost money to produce right? While I will absolutely give away a free portal after a dungeon (I'm likely going to teleport out for 50% of the price anyways) I certainly don't give them away for free *just because*. That's not to say I've never given away a cheap portal, but I won't advertise it.
---
I used to dominate in the little helicopter. I'm talking 80 or 90+ kills spawn camping the enemy base. Good times. Those screenshots of the scoreboard are lost to time :(
---
first layering will be REMOVED as soon phase 2 hits people complain about farming but there are just two alternative 1. without dynamic respawns there will be not enought supply for the server and this will get expensiv af
---
2. with dynamic respawns there will be mafias who controll everything that expensiv like on privat servers
---
so in conclusion layering is the solution that is the lesser evil but people love to complain about  blizzard without a good solution
---
It wasn't
---
This is fine and all but when hunters stop multi shooting, warlocks and priest stop dotting everything then I'll use sheep again. As it is now it's a waste of mana because the CC gets instantly broken by some dipshit. Hunters are the worst fucking offender of this.
---
- his personality 
---
- his support
---
- his income
---
- his influence
---
- the handouts he is getting

- jelly

I dont watch his stream to often but I think he is doing more good than bad for the communitie.
---
Everything he does only matters on his server anyways.
---
Simply it's what What said. Days are equal length to night, as the sun is crossing the celestial equator heading south for northern hemisphere winter. Spring equinox sun is crossing celestial equator heading north.

Solstice is the sun is reaching it's highest/lowest points in the sky, results in longest/shortest days of the year.
---
It's been updated for Classic.
---
I saw this on my phone, and read the text while scrolling before I saw the third frame.  Laughed really hard when I scrolled down to the third frame.
---
I just ignore and move on.  If they're particularly egregious, I'll make a mental note to remember it, and decline group content they're a part of.  Pretty easy to do as a healer.
---
I'm of the mindset that people with that mentality (as a general rule) will not be around for long.  I'm sure some of them will stick it out, but I think the majority will be gone, probably before phase 1 ends.
---
Slightly tangential, I spent a bit more time thinking about this than is probably reasonable.  I asked myself if I'm ignoring too many people.  Then I thought about how these servers are designed to hold 10k people, which is many multiples of what the original vanilla servers had.  Community is important, but I think the people I made a positive impression on will be enough.  I don't think the relative minority that I decided to ignore will be enough of an influence to be a problem in the future.  But I do think I've ignored more people already in classic than I did in all of vanilla.
---
go back to retail, scum.
---
Because my buddies are from Canada and the US. They are the ones who got me into WoW so made sense to okay with them haha.
---
There are good players and there are bad players in all roles. Some tanks are just shit. Just like some healers are shit and some dps are shit.
---
Tanking isn't that difficult. It's more difficult than pressing multi shot and then complaining about having aggro, though.
---
Hier haste.
---
Keep in mind that mage, warrior and priest are the most popular classes. Did MC last week and we had 6 priests and 7 mages fighting over three pieces of T1 loot, while me (Paladin) and our one druid walked out with 3 &amp; 5-piece bonuses.
---
never greed
---
I know, right? Idiots kept telling me weapons like 'B' were better and I'm like "...how?"
---
Stfu please
---
It's about how these programs send inputs to the game. Look up a bluepost on the topic.
---
Hey look everybody, we found the tank!  
---
We do arena just fine. I've been in groups that did a few other bosses to tank free. My void walker has tanked. Definitely don't need you for arena.  
---
We hit respawns when we clear normally. I haven't hit respawns once when we aoe clear. Riddle me that..
---
Thanks! Can you use these "raid" settings in a 5-man party somehow? I've never been in raid.
---
Cant find a Version for Classic :(
---
Yeah. With the AOE-spam meta, going prot actually makes you a worse tank. It's ... silly.
---
Kudos for the dedication :)
---
I did one with a mage and 2 locks and they all ran out of mana at 30% mob HP then we took *even longer* to wand them to death than if they just single targeted everything. I tried to explain this to them and one dude's solution was literally "we just need to pull more to make it more efficient" BITCH THAT WILL LENGTHEN THE TIME EVEN MORE
---
To *play* with them.
---
If they want it for the gold, it's literally the definition of greed. If you aren't going to use it yourself, then you don't need it.
---
I cant tell you how much i appruciate that you kept the original UI style, this will be very useful thank you so much.
---
Tailoring has a lot of Max level BOP chest items which look real nice stats wise. Should I get tailoring on all my clothies for them to benefit from this? 
---
Does LW and BS have important BOP items I should look out for?
---
Its a little environmentalist being angry people use coal as fuel still.
---
I was under the impression that the reason why Warlocks get a free mount is due to the fact that you have to pay a lot of gold to buy all skill books for demons.
---
&gt; You’re a healer, you shouldn’t outright not heal someone for having aggro.
---
An explicit part of being an mmo healer is thinking triage.  If 1 non-tank is absorbing too much of your mana for the group to be successful, the correct utilitarian decision is to not heal that person.  At that point there's no need to be concerned about losing them, because doing so will be a net positive to the group.
---
Your argument is predicated on the healer having unlimited healing resources, which is never true in an mmo.  But just to be clear, the real answer is generally somewhere in between.
---
And this!
---
I’m not here to look at people karma farm. I’m interested in some pvp encounters, some boss kills, some tips and tricks. Not some dudes wowtography over the mountain while the sun is setting in durotar saying “it’s been a long 14 years but I’ve finally returned home”.
---
Maybe he's speaking the Demon equivalent of Spanish? lol
---
Great, thanks. I thought that maybe with the lower ranks, the enemies have a higher chance of resisting.
---
Honestly it's up to the individual if the player is scum or not, usually you can deduce alot from class/race/gender/faction/name combination. For me kill on sight would be nightelf male rogues. I can kill those solo as a priest. Then comes nightelf male hunters, are a little harder so I don't initiate that fight. Then come human male paladins.
---
I find gnome mages to be really hostile, but can't do anything vs them in PVP unless I have help.
---
I never initiate gank on warriors, they have it hard enough.
---
Hunters are still awful. That hasn't changed one bit.
---
Keep strider, follow your heart girl
---
I think it's because warlocks and paladins have 0 mobility spells until 40.
---
Mages have blink
---
Hunters have cheetah
---
Druids have cat / seal / travel forms
---
Shamans have ghost wolf
---
Rogues have dash
---
Hell, Warriors can charge at critters for a good distance boost. 
---
Warlocks and paladins? Nothin'
---
As someone whos also a vengeful rogue, thia addon is a blessing.

Thank you! Everybody's so quick to say "It's obvious that you need if you want to use it and greed if you want to sell it", but we're dealing with potentially dishonest people. Protect yourself, roll need on BOEs. Feel free to encourage the rest of your group to do the same.
---
I fight people who are horde cause horde is garbage.
---
For sure. That was what I was under the impression of. It's just people kept telling me, in these exact situations, that weapon 'B' was better. Just needed confirmation before I started calling people idiots.
---
I was shocked at the number of people on both factions who are avoiding pvp until phase 2/3 because "phase 1 is for leveling"
---
I'm like..we..are still on a PvP server...in WARcraft...
---
What this guy just said
---
yup this, i’m nice enough to let everybody roll.  
---
i’m not nice enough to trust people I may never see again
---
Chucu chucu chucu chucu chucu chucu UUUUUH UUUUUH!
---
Idk I think the same percentage of people are hating pewdiepie, ninja, jacksepticeye and all the other "content creators" for some personal reason.
---
Asmon really isnt that weird or toxic, not more like any other player I experienced in wow.
---
He isnt proud of all the weirdos in his chat, just like all the weirdos on twitch, the weirdos who buy bathwater from a gamergirl or the toxic people in any league of legend chat.
---
I dont watch his content because I am not interested, but I am not delusional either like half the people here pretending he is satan.
---
That's why I hate playing with my paladin friend. I feel like we get targeted by the horde when they see him
---
You don’t even need a tank in low lvl dungeons. Not impressive at all
---
I solo'd this on a level 11 warlock..

Witnessed!

I would abandon humar tbh.
---
Brokentooth is objecitvely the best pet in the game for pvp and pve and is super hard to tame.
---
Strider clutchmother has a special hidden ability called "lookin fly as fuck" and is also hard to tame.
---
You dont need 2 cats, you dont need 2 fashion pets, get rid of the worse cat in my opinion
---
The respawn rate if the shamans in winterspring made me a very pissed off gnome warlock. Throw in a wierd troll warrior  that was OK with mutual assured destruction and I'm now KOS
---
Just say you want some time to quest alone with some music on to get immersed. 
---
If they cling then insist and reply that you can group again in future. Any sane person won’t cry over being told to adventure alone for a while. 
---
If they immediately respect your decision then they clearly are a good friend to have.
---
Yes you can turn your party settings to show raid frame by default so it shows anytime you're in a party.
---
Don't remember where the exact option is but it's somewhere in the settings where social or party stuff is
---
Uh, WoW is a skill and gear based game.   
---
What exactly are you basing your opinions on? It sounds like you've never had something go to shit and had to use things in your skill toolkit..  
---
None of this is about ego, at all. Where do you get that from?
---
A big reason why I play as a tank is because I CANNOT stand playing behind a horrible tank so might as well do the job myself and lead. The tank is THE engine of the group if they fail at their job the whole process will be slow, bad, failure...etc. Tanks impact on group performance is much higher than the rest; second comes healing.
---
They speak when you tell them to do something, but your text is in demonic.
---
Immersion?
---
Bro! I’m the guy my friends are trying to ditch! I’ve only put 5 days into my toon where they have 11 - I can’t keep up - I have a job and kids and stuff. Sigh.
---
It’s okay though! Just tell him you need to do some strange thorn quests on your own for a bit and keep up with guildies. He will understand. There are 900 other new kids in Barrens chat that will join him.
---
Nothing.
---
No way to open it or? With Buff/Alchemy something?
---
I bought a bunch of silk cloth for 35S/stack. Nice 5s profit those sellers thought. WRONG!
---
I turned it into bandages and sold for 40S. Perfect afk farm. 
---
Just put your character next to a vendor and start making them.
---
It was on the classic wow free server subs you were on. Are you really going to play dumb? So what, free servers are all memes and shitposts but r/classicwow is serious business?
---
Pally+lock is just as good of a leveling duo as warrior+priest
---
You can do all Uldaman *dungeon* quests in one run. There are a ton of quests labeled Uldaman, but they are outside of the dungeon.
---
Genuine question... Why does it matter how much money he makes when it comes to prize money that you could win?

Ignore lists, booting, and server shaming aren't good options. What does that actually accomplish? Sure, you CAN potentially make some people aware of the ninja... if they're also in trade chat with you. And believe you. And care enough. And then remember the guy's name. That's hardly a "guarantee".
---
In an age of easy access to photoshop and other editing software, I'm not even particularly willing to believe screenshots of bad behavior.
---
The problem is the person needing the purple as an upgrade might aswell just not equip it and go on with his free gold that you all gave him. This is why people don't trust it and roll the moneyroll on expensive items.
---
Honestly honor system with dishonorable kills would fix a lot of the corpse camp low kill issues.
---
But if you pvp seriously you need a real  one.
---
I've had this happen and told them to roll.  I lost the roll and then offered to buy it from the winner.  They sold it too me at 75% of AH value, which was nice of them.
---
Well yeah it obviously depends on how casual your guild is. I'd imagine it's not a problem for most guilds since they're not pushing for faster kills but if you are expecting your guild to be utilizing a fury dualwield main tank the dps aren't going to be very happy about the druids threat.
---
What?
---
Why do I see so many warriors, I feel like I see more of them than any other class. Is it cause they want to tank or dps ? I'll be questing and seriously I will always run into warriors more than any other class.
---
Check the box that says something along the lines of "display raid frames in party", then set health display to numeric instead of percent.
---
Thinking back, this was an HP Media Center PC (the one with a TV tuner) with 2 gigs of RAM, AMD dual core, and to which I added a Geforce 7950 gt.
---
Yeah it'll damage the pristine reputation of WoWs thriving eSports..
---
Thanks so much!
---
Well yeah, it is more entertaining than living vicariously through a streamer.
---
Name checks out
---
Look dude, I understand Asmongold is living rent free in your head, just relax dude.
---
He's clearly talking about people constantly complaining about him on r/classicwow , and you're obviously one of them, just let go.
---
You know pservers actually had some really good tournaments, that actually did a lot for the community.
---
So shut up.
---
Get into a good aoe group. Its fucking awesome. I leveled as a warrior back in vanilla and decided to roll Mage for Classic. The aoe meta is awesome. The whiners in here are just mad they aren't invited. Good mages and bad mages still exist and that's nothing new.
---
It’s not a hard counter or anything, but shamans have the purge ability which is basically the same as priests dispel magic ability (except it can only be used on enemy targets), so you can effectively remove and blessing of freedom / blessing of protection. Priests can also do the same. It just allows horde to have more offensive dispels / purges at a time. 
---
Don’t get me wrong tho, paladins are definitely killer in a BG.
---
You can find the same item in retail lol
---
Hahah, didn’t even make that connection myself, Good on you
---
We have a lot of AoE... but that shit is weak for the mana cost. If you don't have multiple AoE classes, it's fairly useless in big groups cause they won't die fast enough anyway and everyone will just end up OoM and dead.
---
I sometimes AoE if I see the tank has good aggro and I know shit will die, if I pull I iceblock closer to the tank and if anything, I'm totally fine spamming frostbolt and going the tanks pace.
---
I feel bad for everyone who gets these crazy mage who sre in such a hurry and yet don't join a spellcleave group that would be more appropriate with what they want to do. Jeesh.
---
if the item is one or two or even more levels above me but will be close to a BiS,  and nobody has a use for it (like a hunter's bow or whatev), you better believe i'm gonna need. There's no guarantee i'm gonna find one as good in two levels
---
Iggy is that you?
---
Let me know if u have troubles
---
Btw theres a lot of addon u can search for, and the install is auto locate ur folder u dont have to put it manualy
---
Dont think so, I used to do this a lot in the live game and never got punished
---
It's them being nostalgic and that content would exist IF PEOPLE WOUDN'T LAYER AWAY FROM PVP
---
Noggenfogger EU here, never queuetime FeelsGoodMan
---
damn playing the simplest class in a game, spamming 1 button the whole dungeon and then calling the tank cry baby that can't keep agro? who's the ignorant here... can you mages do raids alone? no you need others. Others who are not as fast at leveling as mages are. that narrow mentality where it's everyone for themselves is very bad long term, in an mmorpg like classic. In modern games sure, all content is already tuned to be experienced solo but in a game that requires cooperation, gatekeeping half the player base just because you want an easy way to grind xp can be detrimental and that post is a reactionary effect to this toxic meta.
---
The funny part is seeing all those mages rushing to 60 by exploiting strategies that would have been nerfed in vanilla, had they become this popular, but instead are protected under the guise of no changes, all for what exactly?
---
Classic is not about end game. BFA has more end game than classic. heck even WOD had more end game activities than classic.
---
what's even better is the counter slap all these spellcleave only mages are gonna get when they realize that there are just too many mages to fit in raid groups. again a long term effect. but in a month or 2, there will be posts about mages not finding spots in raid groups. i expect numbers around 15-25% of all mages will end up without a guaranteed raid spot.
---
I don't expect you to understand what i am trying to warn about, from what i read from you, you don't seem like someone who can see that far ahead anw.
---
I rolled a warlock and only ever did each dungeon once, I've never gone for loot. Like a hunter, we're not THAT dependent on gear so we can level without it.
---
I skipped SFK, RFK, RFD and ZF. I've done WC, BRD and SM (each wing once). Personally I like world questing and you eventually get nice upgrades to your gear as you go.
---
My bad. Understood it wrong.
---
Do your part mate. Good work
---
Reroll. Seriously, azeroth needs a mage thanos doing some cleansing.
---
Whenever i see a mage from the other faction aoe farm in the open world im legally obliged to gank them for as long as possible.
---
This all got way more deep than I expected and when I posted my feelings on the two games. I have no regrets about my time spent on retail. Even when I’ve quit playing wow off and on over the years, I’m a proud player and I wouldn’t trade my experiences for anything. This game in a weird way is a huge part of who I am and has brought me so many memories that I cherish. My conflict of which game to play and why isn’t a matter of me sitting around miserable. It’s simply a matter of how much time I have and which route feels like it matters more to me personally right now.
---
Hmm let’s look at [leather belts lvl 15-22 with at least 1 point of intellect](https://classic.wowhead.com/leather-armor/min-req-level:15/max-req-level:22/slot:6?filter=23;2;1) . Let’s count together, one belt, two, thre oh that’s horde only, hope you aren’t alliance.... three, fou.... oh that’s Druid only hope you aren’t a shaman, fiv... oh that’s also horde only... so leather belts that anyone can get, total number **two**
---
How about [cloth belts, wonder how many they have](https://classic.wowhead.com/cloth-armor/min-req-level:15/max-req-level:22/slot:6?filter=23;2;1) wooooooow double digits???? They have 12 belts with at least one int, one belt restricted on each faction soooo 11 belts total that either faction can get. But no, let’s not let any non-cloth wearing healers roll on cloth, they should go farm there one of two leather belts available to them instead.
---
Rod Serling was a genius.  
---
The black and white ones are good.  The colored episodes suck that they made after the originals &amp; I havent seen any of the "newer" remade ones on CBS and don't plan to.
---
One of my favorite TV series of all time.
---
Reported for posting porn!
---
"What are the odds":  
---
it's 1 / 10000  
---
Why?  
---
2nd man needs to roll the same number as 1st. So there's 1/100 change for that.  
---
Then the process repeats, so again 1/100.  
---
Now we multiply the results (for separate events you multiply), and we get 1/10000
---
Man you're making me wanna roll a tank, so I don't have to deal with someone like you.
---
Uhhh..... I have 17 days /played
---
Gime us the money so we can build a rig just to play games.
---
Feels
---
You know, in the chaos of the actual battle when there are many people playing. You really can't tell whose got freedom or certain buffs to purge them so the effectiveness of those buffs are still good and not always dispelled. The same can be said about many classes. I'm playing a Warrior now but my main in Vanilla was a Paladin and BOY was my holy-paladin important in BGs. People don't want to be support in PvP but I LOVE to be support and to do that well will turn the tides HARD in any BG.
---
no thats in phase 5
---
Bruh there's been so many changes that differ from original vanilla that #nochanges is a joke
---
For me personally. Taking every mob from a zone in one pull.   
---
Dont give a fuck what mages do in instances.
---
i mean there is a lot of salt here and a lot of circlejerking, but guess you could say that about a lot of subs on reddit
---
bruh
---
Money isn't everything but it helps. The point is, the game has little to no reputation from an eSport perspective.
---
But, the most popular streamer for the game has secured a lucrative sponsor, something the p servers couldn't do.
---
The point that I'm making is, if the tournament doesn't go well, or isn't popular, it doesn't matter that Asmon hosted it, because he's one of the few people in the position to make something like this happen.
---
With his popularity, if the tournament doesn't go over well, then the tournaments just aren't a good idea.
---
If the most popular streamer can't make a good event with the resources he has available to him, no one can make a good event.
---
Guy with zero understanding of threat can't figure out why people get mad at him when he pulls. You're basically the description of everyone who fails at this game.
---
You can block guild and channel invites in the options menu. Its unfortunate that we have to resort to that but it's better than being spammed :/
---
Do LB&gt;CL&gt;shock. Bigger burst. The CL cast goes off as the LB hits, it you do it right.
---
It's almost as if I was making a joke/comment about the quest design and map directions, the main topic of the post. Guess you have to add a /s to everything or smug redditors will pounce on the chance to call someone stupid.
---
Buying linen cloth from the AH for less than than 28c each so you can make them into linen bags and vendor them for profit
---
Yeah but thorium is also like 10g a stack.
---
I can confirm; I remember when Alliance was popular and we have to wait A LONG time for hordes to queue up in our server. For sure cross-server BGs weren't a thing for a long time.
---
I'd ask in either trade, or the general chat on the zone you're in
---
For what it’s worth,  your Verdant Keepers Aim is better.
---
when you keep running something then search for a nice group of people who run it with you until everybody got his items .... at least that´s what I do, you get smooth runs with relaxed people and don´t even need to care about the loot because it will come eventually...
---
Oh man, this gave me flashbacks of some terrible tanks... it's like they do a pull, then just tunnel-vision into DPS onto one target.
---
Sciperock!
---
Nice summary, what's this gold farming spot you're talking about? Is it something inside one of the three wings?
---
Had completely forgotten about that one, awesome!
---
Reason I’m asking is: i got myself a Bat pretty early on and trained it with me all the way to 35. Now I’m in Stranglethorn and I tamed a tiger. But the tiger has 0 tp after taming it. Should I get it leveld up and to lv6 loyalty before getting the same amount of TP my bat has? Since i can’t learn the Tiger anything right now...
---
I bought the pattern for robe of the Archmage last night bc there was a guy in trade chat selling for 20g cheaper than AH. I didn’t realize how expensive the mats were. Is it worth spending so much time/money farming/buying them for one armor piece? I understand it’s bis through phase 4, but it basically means no epic mount for a while.
---
I am exactly the same. Wibbles my Durotar tiger has been with me since level 10 and god damn he is gonna be there at the end!
---
Yeah they’ve been around for a couple of weeks now. Here is a setting in options where you can block invites to chat channels
---
Actual lol 😁
---
HAXX?!
---
I don’t play when she’s around. She’ll give me crap lol.. she’s a nurse who works night shifts which is pretty ideal for some good WOW nights.
---
Basically just get various green items with str/agi/stam, there's no big items.
---
Finally time to meet that fine gentleman with the funny character name down in Ratchet!
---
your job is to position the mobs and pull them into a spot where mages and locks can nuke them down. you wont ever get the aggro back if the mages pull it of you so they have to kite the mobs. You can Whirlwind with a 2hd weapon to kill the pull faster. 
---
It isn't the convencional way of tanking but as a warrior you have the best mobility with charge and intercept to move between unpulled mobgroups and position them properly. 
---
I would only recommend it tho if you know that the dd's know what they are doing. 
---
Side note: if mobs are frozen, they'll attack whatever is in range no matter the aggro, so make sure you're not in BerzerkerStance when a mage uses frostnova.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Im a hunter, this could work for me too with fein death....if there where any mobs to round up. Sadly they are all chasing a gnome frost mage.
---
All you are doing is taking a 1 in 100 roll to match a random number between 1 and 100. That first random number has no value of chance because it is simply randomly generated.
---
thanks for response!
---
would you change anything in this tree: https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/class-guide/rogue/leveling-1-60/
---
or is it solid? Based on your response I think it makes more sense than I thought but still it seems kinda strange since it picks talents like "Remorsless Attacks" and "Deflection"+"Riposte" where all 3 talents seem to me like solo content oriented and on the other hand it skips "Endurance".
---
Im around lvl 35 so prolly wont reroll before getting to 60 but would like to hear your opinion anyway.
---
I WISH any of my outfits came together as perfectly as yours while leveling.
---
If your group is a bunch of randoms expect them to roll on everything. I personally only roll on shit I need and pass on everything else. Would rather help gear up fellow horde players than get a bit of gold.
---
Found the asshole mage.
---
I did it on firemaw EU for 3 hours and maybe 1 or 2 other people were there. Not that busy.
---
Second this. Switched from bartender to dominos. No funny issues anymore.
---
Oh nice didnt know that, I joined before the naxx patch back then, good of them to try and replicate the feeling
---
Does brd not work?
---
The R word, you mean retard?
---
I’m a gnome mage aoe farming D:
---
But I don’t bring it to dungeons or hog quest mobs from others.
---
L’esprit de l’escalier plus Dunning-Kruger syndrome is a powerful cocktail.
---
On my server, world is literally just a few furries ERPing.
---
"Huh? That one sounds cool."
---
*clicks link*
---
Does not work with WoW Classic.
---
Bit of a shit article, really.
---
It was on XP
---
makes sense, ty
---
What’s Training probably
---
To break gouge or blind they have to enter combat to break it with damage, vanishing takes YOU out of combat but you keep the tag on the mob.
---
I love confrontations while questing but this ridiculous 10 vs 1 happening to Alliance every where (even in Stonepine) is just getting ridiculous. What's hilarious is they will never touch you unless they outnumber you and are sure they'd win. But in the other hand, we the underdog Alliance, leave them in peace when we out number them. This is the attitude I saw during my group experience and world questing in my server.
---
It will get TP at every friendship rank up.
---
It's a formula based on friendship rank and raw level to get the total, but I dont know it off-hand.
---
Then there are the warlocks who pull the same shit, but don’t have the means to save themselves
---
That could be a reason. My plan is to buy the early imp and succ books and then  saving gold by buying the highest rank.
---
Ok well that gives me a little confidence, I'm just worried cause I'm on a low pop server and I want to tank and I'm good at it. Just the amount of warriors I run by is astronomical compared to anythin else and discouraging me a bit.
---
thanks for response, now it makes sense
---
I never even thought about two druids fighting in classic until just now. Must be excruciating.
---
I was doing arena in WOTLK with a friend (who played tauren resto shammy through every expac) and the last two left were him and a pally, I think it took near 30 minutes for him to finally win.
---
Hey with AoE farming and cleave groups you’ll do 30-40 in like 2 days, go for it :P
---
You're a lost cause it's fine other free options out there that are better but you want to defend the watermarked one
---
Alright, thanks for the info... I guess I just take the cat for a spin and it’ll gather tp along the way
---
So wait, you're telling me they Needed to sell for Gold? That's what the damn Greed button is for! The clues in the name! XD 
---
Ugh, yeah those were nasty players. **It is** ***not*** **acceptable to roll Need on an item if you won't use it.**
---
Say what you will, Barrens Chat is one of the best things about WoW. People socialize and make jokes and have fun.
---
If you don't like it, play Alliance on a no-pop carebear server.
---
In a dungeon group?
---
&gt;Oh there is a reward alright.
---
Even I'm eating these tears up and I wasn't even involved.
---
your words are QFFT (quoted for f truth)
---
this is all you need to know when asking why 
---
a) there are so few tanks, and literally any group is looking for one in /4
---
b) you can preach whatever you want, they won't listen, and you should adapt to this and only make it your responsibility to protect the healer and f the rest of ignorant douches
---
Thank you very much for this. Great spreadsheet!
---
That is a good idea and I do try for this.
---
I always pay 20s for 4 stacks of water from the first mage I see who can make the right level water for me. A lot of the time they just ignore you otherwise.
---
I was asking a mage for water while out questing and he would stop and look at me for a while and then continue just jumping around the quest hub we were at. He ran off and I found him again 30 seconds later. I opened the trade window and put in 10g and as if by magic he had 3 stacks of water for me and put them in the trade window.
---
I cancelled the trade, called him a gold-digger and ran away.
---
You're just not very funny, sorry ❤
---
How exactly is she doing a good job? The boat alone added more carbon than simply taking a flight to NY, and she is flying back anyways. Also she is an alarmist terrified by her insane parents. 
---
She needs to go her ass back to school.
---
Guy with zero understanding of game mechanics can't figure out why people get mad at him when he pulls too little. You're basically the description of everyone who takes 5 hours to finish a single run of SM GY.
---
Well he’s still the best even if he had a 30 second respawn. He’s heavily contested on Kromcrush, it took myself (58 at the time) and several helpful guildies to beat back 3 60 horde during the 2 hour spawn window for me to get him. There were several alliance looking around for him, too
---
Gonna be honest whenever I see an enemy faction mage AoE farming. I kill them. To the little gnome 2 pack trying to AoE farm Jade Frye satrys I’m sorry but you can’t have the bulk farm :)
---
I know they're not,  I know they probably come from edgy 12 y/o.
---
That doesn't make them ok. Same goes for insults actually.
---
Yep. There should be absolutely no priority for low level to have priority on that lev35 epic item just because it's currently an upgrade for them. In 2 days /played more, it isn't, so it's not worth stealing 100g away from the party. If the one claiming they need it is at all on the map about the game they also realize this, and then you are into drama about "well, equip it" when even the needer would rather put it in AH.
---
I wouldn't oppose that it was a greed roll between players even at 60. [Myrmidon's Signet](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2246/myrmidons-signet) dropped to my _guild_ run, and I still greeded on it and agreed to pay half of AH price (75g) to winner for it. I'm not entirely sure still if it's 2nd or 3rd best ring for me pre-raid, and it was guild, and I still felt money4AH was acceptable fashion. But I guess more people lean at actual BIS items should always be favored towards the needers, won't disagree with that.
---
what is 5man conan? This shit seems fun
---
Jesus, imagine believing in climate alarmism. 
---
The climate changes, get over it. We aren't dying and the world isn't ending.
---
Since when do warlocks have stealth?
---
They really do give themselves a bad reputation in Classic. I was questing in WPL yesterday in the graveyard at the south with like 5 other people trying to get the quest done, and this shitter mage kept pulling everything and killing them so slowly that people were standing around watching him. It was nice seeing him die unable to kill 4 mobs at once.
---
there was no cross realm or lfr in tbc though... or even in wotlk, it didn't come until cata lol
---
It depends what you are doing. High m+ keys tanking is way harder than Classic tanking. You don’t have to worry about threat but about so many more things
---
Couldn't agree more with the sentiment.  Just the other day there was this one mage in the hillsbrad fields constantly aoe grinding on the hillsbrad farmers including the named npcs that people need for the quests.  I threw an invite so I can at least get the tag for my quest and he replied "sorry you can't aoe" and declined the invite.  This is the kind of selfish assholes we're dealing with here.
---
So you are most likely doing ZF. Mount up, gather the mobs behind your chosen LOS spot. You could try to do like clap+battleshout spam. When you see the first frost nova go off, get the fuck out.
---
All of the youtube videos cant be wrong!
---
Not nearly as much. Don’t lie.
---
Looks like when he ran, it moved him off of the boat
---
Copying something done better by someone else is almost always a lucrative business model, Hatemail did it better.
---
Yes there is multiple. 
---
You can solo Tribute runs of Dire Maul as a hunter and a couple of other classes if done correct.
---
You can also AOE farm lashers in DM East as a Mage, Priest, Paladin (anyone with a Little AOE that doesn't die really) and get some raw Gold from that.
---
Both very strong Gold farms that were used plenty on private Servers and probably already in classic back then
---
Depends on your priorities really but I would recommend getting the mats for the robe eventually because like you said, it's bis for a while.
---
The spot is just outside of guard aggro range.
---
Could be a cheater. Wouldn't be the first time a flying character has been spotted
---
I too had to delve in those magazines because I had to buy new furniture and decorate my house from scratch a month ago :) Long hours spent on ikea.com and various deco instagram accounts :D Those imitation plants are awesome. Bought real ones and they died inn a week :')

I heard this 2nd and 3rd hand, so take it with a grain of salt.  He talked non stop about getting back to the lore, magic, and romantic difficulty of Vanilla, then ran AOE groups incessantly and ninja’d everything that dropped just for gold.  Claimed he’s never going to take handout, then collected gold from fans like a corrupt Sheriff.  Claims to enjoy the excitement of world PVP, then won’t take a shit in a contested zone without backup.
---
"half t0" should tell you he has no idea about tanking
---
Mmrrggll
---
Drood dool.
---
And that logic right there is how you get people who justify being racist, homophobic, or really any sort of bigot.
---
Where do you think these huge ass totems in Thunder Bluff come from?
---
Sorry, what’s a whale?
---
Sigh, here we go again \*unzips pants\*
---
Healing mages who get to close when using nova, bursthealing tank at the initial pull while he is stacking mobs, wanding totems.
---
Yep, Orc Hunters and Undead Rogues are KoS at all times.
---
Lots of us literally used our one vacation of the year on it. Don’t feel bad.
---
This is crazy how many people are buying PCs for this. Two of my friends and my little brother have as well.

In retail you can get kicked from party, if you break a silence or ask some questions.

True story...

Troll are the master PvE race.
---
awww poor baby. Did the alliance kill you and hurt your feelings
---
No  this early on a solid blue  BOE is more valuable to everyone for its sale value than a small upgrade that can be replaced in a few levels.  Groups should be discussing this at the start of the run to decide if they will all need or greed.   I tell all of my PUG groups to need on any rare BOES to avoid someone ninjaing it
---
Not true. If you spec combat and take sword specialisation you want to have both weapons to be swords. Try to find faster sword to your offhand, they so exist.
---
During leveling though it might not be the best idea to take any specific weapon specialisation talents from combat tree and just use the weapons you can get ignoring their type.
---
In lvl 60 though, if you play combat I recommend choosing wether you play daggers or swords and spec accordingly + use either 2 swords or 2 daggers, not a split.
---
I just spent an hour fishing in feralas, it was a fucking amazing way to start the day.
---
This makes me think that probably at some point, someone did the same mistake, but on a quest that already made that mistake so they ended up at the right place anyway and didn't even notice they actually read the quest wrong
---
My GF has attempted to belittle gaming and you just need to stand your ground. If it's something you enjoy why let someone take that away from you? Now by GF treats it as one of my hobbies and I actually got her playing harvest moon on my switch until animal crossing comes out. There's a game for everyone, maybe not WoW, they just don't know it yet.
---
Bullshit, there is zero guarantee everyone will behave in pugs hence if something valuable drops I am not going to hold back either. IF we talk about certain items beforehand then that's cool with me but don't expect me to not need on valuable boes without any discussion. 
---
If you want complete loot safety play with friends or with your guild.
---
We are not living in a perfect world.
---
I'd say that, yeah. What're you looking to get into? The four specs I'd recommend to start out on is either solo/raiding combat, full raiding combat, PvP daggers or PvP Hemo-Swords.
---
I didn't get my on first run but something around 5ish. However, when it dropped and I needed it, another pattern dropped right after. 
---
Out of 3 enemies that could drop it, 2 out of 3 on 1 run is pretty good.
---
15min lmao
---
The magic words that pull me back to UO.
---
Just to offer a different perspective: aoe in Classic as a mage is a very cool, but difficult mechanic. Used in the right scenarios - the spiders and scorps in LBRS, undead in Strat, scorps in Uldaman, beetles in ZF etc. - it is a very powerful, very useful tool. I need to get a feel for my tank and healer, but i can generally solo these groups without dying if i do it right. I just let the tank know that it's pointless to try and keep threat after I start and I need to be hella careful to stay out of melee range, but it saves the group soo much time and trouble having the mage nuke the entire group in 10 seconds flat.
---
In most other situations, meaning pretty much every elite mob in every dungeon, aoe isn't a good option. Tank can't possibly keep threat, if I'm the only mage I'll def oom before they die and even if we're several mages we need to drink 0-full after every single fight. Just not worth it.
---
All in all I really like doing aoe on the fights that were made for it but hate the spellcleave "aoe all the things" meta.
---
It said northwest lol
---
Especially when it’s nothing more than a kill quest, fucking invite 4 others and just help your faction ffs.  It’s mind blowing the amount of people running around soloing, ignoring everyone around them.  It’s not retail, there’s no tag sharing.  We ALL get done quicker if we group up.
---
That's mages in a nutshell. Upper advantage through 99% of the leveling process. Die to 1 player and whine on reddit about spell batching.
---
Got herbalism (already had skinning) and just starzed vendoring everything and thats 6g in 1 day. Thanks a lot!!
---
A dress that will bring you destruction!!!!!
---
It would take days to clear a single quest in the Stonetalon mountains, if everyone went by that logic.
---
&gt;and they die like half the time too because I'm not wasting mana dropping several huge heals on ya
---
*proceeds to spend 70% of mana bar to ress*
---
Does it automatically configure with the add on?
---
I mean, I agree with the sentiments but to be fair, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch are all nu-Blizzard games that have been received well.
---
Yeah, HotS is a bit of a meme after the whole eSports thing and HS is a mobile game but Overwatch took off really well and I don't think anyone can deny any of their successes.
---
Former hunter main, never had to pug with hunters. Never understood huntard memes. 
---
I understand now: pet aggro on other groups, break 100% of cc, everything is a hunter item, pathetic dps, never focuses the right target and pulls aggro, feigns death prematurely and just watches the slow wipe.
---
My god it’s so true.
---
no after their 60 went to bed we shrekt them
---
Thank you so much!
---
They aren’t killing you because you’re a mage, they kill you because you are there to be killed.
---
Just don’t be a dick, join one of the guild in the LFG subreddit and quest/dungeon with them and it’s too easy.
---
i love my aquatic form, but fuck it's ugly. (Horde)
---
IMO, horses are the most boring mount in the entire game. All of my alliance toons are either getting a ram or cat, except class mounts of course. NE mounts also have a smooth running style that I like.
---
During raids, paladins will never be pulling aggro, so they'll never need the interruption avoidance. Similarly, with PvP, they'll usually use rip off a few flash heals, which shouldn't get much pushback.
---
Awesome Thanks!
---
MoveAnything can handle this.
---
someone looks MC Hammered
---
&gt;Started being more...conquest oriented.
---
Not just conquest. Genocide.
---
I'd obviously rather do that then go OOM healing DPS and wipe.
---
Sounds like you are the type of player spamming 1 0 1 ç f A A d
---
So during launch week I was a level 28 warrior running RFK for the corpsemaker. I put together a group and to my surprise it drops on my first try! What luck! I think to myself, before noticing a hunter has beat me on the roll. I kick him and we get another DPS and I end up getting the axe a few runs later, but I'm definitely salty about it. Flash forward to mara when another warrior asks me to join saying he'll bring another DPS. So I invite him and lo and behold it's that fucking hunter! So I have them come all the way out to desolace and right before we start I kick the hunter.
---
Call me petty but that felt pretty fucking good.
---
You keep having to post the same message and i keep having to upvote it. I think were caught in an endless cycle
---
Our guild has 6 main raid druids and we just killed rag last night easy as pie. 
---
Anyone who try’s to seriously optimize by class instead of individual is going to have a hard time.
---
It took me like 5min to follow your math. So what you are saying is that one stack of linen is worth 5.66s when converted to a linen bag and sold to vendor.
---
Yup, I enjoy them in group so long as they know they're a DPS battery to unleash at a reasonable pace.  If they watch threat, and target skull, they're always welcome in my group.
---
With limited time in life I have no problem with this.
---
Transferred off Shazzrah Sunday, waited an hour and a half to get in because I had mail
---
Just my own custom UI. I'll post an addons list later.
---
Which of course means that the rest of your group needs to take your word for it that you'll use the item in two levels, which makes it very possible that you're claiming to want to use the item, but are in fact going to sell it, which is yet another good reason to encourage everybody to simply roll need on high-value BoEs.
---
It reminds of the Geralt of Rivia with his horse Roache (except the elf ears)
---
I completely forgot that Uldaman was basically the Indiana Jones dungeon.
---
How can you see your crit chance :O?
---
Mage here. Seeing a lot of hate on us today. Please note we’re not all like this. I actually rarely use my AoE in dungeons. 
---
Please don’t hate as all. 
---
-HMD
---
As soon as somebody jumps me I just take that time to go and pee or get water. No use fighting back because ones you do his friend who is 10 levels higher will spawn from fuckwere and punish you for defending yourself.
---
Yeah, swing and a miss sorry my friend. Every dungeon I dps or heal I get 1-2 friend requests afterwards and people commenting 'best dps/heals I've run with, hit me up anytime'. Your reddit comment isn't gonna touch my massively overinflated tank ego I'm afraid.
---
This is the thing, I played vanilla for 2 years straight way back in the day and still remember it all.
---
I can literally visualize how the next 6 months of my wow experience will play out. While it would be fun and full of nostalgia, I'd rather just skip to the 6 months later and get on with new things in my life.
---
I wish others would see that I'm not putting down classic and I don't have poor time management. It's just that wow cannot be played for an hour here and there if you intend on doing more than just hitting 60. I've already done all that on like 6 different characters so it isnt worth it to me.
---
have wild sex with him until he gets over you
---
Fizzwidget Hunter's Helper did that but I don't think it works anymore. Do you know if the video was actually a recent video?
---
Two flies with one hit. Thats what im talking about!
---
In a few days from now you'll be wearing whitemanes chapeau. Let's see how cool you look then!
---
I think that’s the case too. The 5+ levels means I can whirlwind cleave about 3 mobs 2 times before needing to feed again. That’s 6 kills every 3-4 minutes. So about 60-70 kills an hour (without dying and minimal downtime between kills).
---
My question is, who is buying these seemingly useless epics? If they are not ideal to use, who is willing to pay a bunch of gold on the AH or trade chat to purchase them?
---
Chances are, you're not killing enough Mobs. When traveling from a Questhub to your destination, kill a few Mobs that give XP along the way. When you're done with a Quest, kill 2 or 3 more Mobs just to be sure.
---
Don't you get 5000g/weekly from the legion pickpocketing quest?
---
If you actually sell it
---
Didn't know this existed, I'm interested too.
---
As mage among many mages, I never advertise my services. However, I get plenty of tells for food/water/portals and almost all players tip me very well for each.
---
To be honest, I all expect is for you to cover cost for portal and nothing is needed for food/water but tips are appreciated. I've yet to meet someone who didn't tip generously
---
the full raiding one, thats why some of the solo oriented talents look like a waste later on but they are amazing atm
---
Noice! Did not expect to see Ren Fest referenced here!
---
Been going there off and on for 24 years.
---
I tought you guys were talking about the vampire stuff and asked myself why this thread is full of Twilight fans lmao
---
Already ahead of you.
---
Exactly why it's called NEED and GREED. One is for needing it, and the other for selling it. Yet people wanna justify rolling for items they can't even equip or have stats which aren't for their class.
---
How do I set the launcher to default to Classic WOW?  Every time I log in, I end up in Retail and have to quit and change the selection.
---
not sure about 1-60, but I leveled 1-110 like 2 months ago with 54 h played. Mix of questing and dungeons (with heirlooms). How much of that was spent afk I'm not sure
---
Thx all for your comment/info . I will holf off on these for now.
---
you don´t have to build a stormwind if you can conquer it
---
In case you find it useful, EasyFishingClassic lets you double right-click the bobble to loot and recast.
---
Check the prices of items on AH that you can craft with BS.  As mentioned by other posters, look at the going prices for
---
* enchanting rods (of various qualities)
---
* sheild spikes
---
* mithril spurs
---
If any of those types of items are selling decently then try to get in on the action.  Also be careful to check that the materials arent selling for more than the items before you post.  I think at this point, the mid-range ore is probably selling decently.  Since you're without your mount, you could put off profession leveling for now and sell all the ore you get for money.
---
Also check the prices of ore vs bars on AH, sometimes one is selling more than the other.
---
dont be silly
---
Wait, mind blown.
---
Off topic: can I log into WoW at work on my MacBook. Join 2 hour server queue. Set up WiFi hotspot on my phone. Connect MacBook. Close MacBook. Put MacBook into bag. Walk to train. Get off train. Walk home. Open MacBook and still be queued?!?
---
I feel ya, i specd to aoe to see how it felt.... holy crap ive never seen such rude mages/people in classic. There is some sort of wierd elitism to being able to aoe pull? Ive only ever experience pleasant people in my 12 hour plus time in classic UNTIL I switch from single target to aoe. The other aoe mages were some of the rudest people. Im switching back to ST tonight...
---
POST MOAR!!!
---
I'm a Hunter from retail who switched mage for classic...
---
Feelsbadman
---
Dungeons is 5g
---
This makes sense . Ty
---
... which is funny because why would anyone buy them if it's dumb to equip them in the first place?
---
In my book, rolling need on anything you plan to sell is ninja looting, period. But I would probably discuss this with the group when something drops before rolling, to make sure everyone is on the same page.
---
Yeah we are only going to be playing in a party.
---
Think I will disclude hunter as really want to try something else. 
---
That leaves me with Rogue, Warrior, Druid or Mage.
---
Agreed, Warrior is a little slow to level but in a party it should be fun for him. And yes, theyre good at both tanking and dps in pve and pvp.
---
Shaman's windfury totem too will be nice as you say.
---
I could go warrior for strong dps and an easy switch to tank when my friend wants to go dps. 
---
Rogue is also fun and a bit different (and different loot/gear than warrior)
---
If i go druid we will have 1 normal ress and 1 battle ress.
---
Travel form is nice but I guess I'm not gonna be running way ahead of my team.
---
Mage is good burst/aoe, drinks and food for the team.
---
I'm leaning towards go mage and levelling my druid on the side and only going on it in the group if my friends want to switch.
---
The repeatable quest is for horde only?
---
I think N1 is Numpad 1.
---
I normally use 1-4/5, QERF
---
Then I use ctrl, shift, and alt modifiers for those bindings. This gives me 24-27 ‘keybinds’ for macros and spells. Typically I use each modifier type for a different group of spells. For example, hunter melee abilities are on shift, pet commands are ctrl, aspects/detects/misc on alt, and ranged abilities with no modifier.
---
I agree, but it is a hobby that dominates more than others. It is difficult to login and just play for an hour or 2 because you won't achieve much.
---
We are living in a world of etiquette and consequences. Needing on something to sell it (or taking it without permission) has ALWAYS been the definition of ninja'ing something. This will be upheld in Classic. You ninja, and your guild leader/the server shall know. If your guild likes having ninjas you'll probably be fine, but that won't be a very popular guild I'm telling ya.
---
Yeah as someone who's quite new to wow I didnt get close to that amount. 25 gold at lvl 40, now at the same amount at lvl 42 but with all professions at 200 as well. I'll never get a summon to an instance so I like getting the mount earlier, but it's still bloody unfair.
---
Someone may correct me but I think in classic there weren’t  necessarily an overall “pvp gear” vs “pve gear” tracks. I think the BiS items you see online for your class for pre raid are probably the ones that are also best for pvp. Resilience wasn’t a thing until TBC, so hard core raiders could run into a battleground with their pve raid gear and do very well.
---
look, a mage player who thinks he's the best at the game.
---
Bats are actually a tiny bit 'better' for leveling simply because they can learn Bite were as Owls get Claw instead, the problem is if you have have Claw and Screech on auto-cast then the AI just sort of derps and randomly chooses one or the other to spam (it wont do the smart thing of maintaining screech debuff and then dumping into Claw), Bats on the other hand will spam Screech AND will use Bite the moment its off cooldown which is far more efficient AND they have the exact same stats as Owls.
---
I wasn't spamming or typing anything at that point. I was on voice coms.
---
I try to toss invites to anyone near me, just in case they need the same shit I do.  The number of solo players who straight up decline my invitation and ranged tag the mob I was going for astounds me.  Fucking cock suckers the lot of them.
---
I think you're on to something.
---
As a Fairbanks warlock, this pleases the dark masters.
---
Depends on your level, somewhere after 40+ questing will become a real slog if you arent a hunter
---
You lose the tap only if the mob resets i believe? So if they run away and evade it then you lose it.
---
This is the exact reason everyone needs.  No chance for anyone to ninja if everyone clicks need.  No matter how well your intentions are when that purple or multiple gold blue BoE drops people turn into craven fiends looking for their fix. To be frank I don’t know any of you.  I am not obligated to give you guys anything. 
---
For BoP dungeon drops those are always need if you need, greed to sell
---
Hey man! I just rolled it to fullfill a childhood dream of completing the lok'delar questline.
---
Would you, or someone please elaborate a little more so more people can not be as bad? I don’t know what hpm means.
---
\#shitpost?
---
Accurate assessment :)
---
While I was posting that last comment I got a whisper asking me to tank UBRS btw.
---
So what you're saying is they're a Primarch.
---
Which in turn is based on short story by Damon Knight.
---
Kromcrush is pretty solid IMO. I see many Alliance in the world and WPvP is healthy.
---
There's only one discord that I know of for Sulfuras and oh boy, definetly not my thing.
---
No. Just maybe don't fucking berate someone because you took the default position of distrust.
---
Oh man, those names are killing me.
---
The rogue one though hurts though how true it is
---
As a shaman, I love it when rogues try to gank me. As long as my reincarnation is up, they are the ones doing the corpse walk. I also will go after them every chance I get now. Since rogues are so fond of ganking when I'm at 30% hp and mana, I make sure to wreck their day when I see one. And the cycle continues.
---
Yes this is what I use. Instead of downloading all of these, I can just download ElvUI... and forever be tweaking my interface.
---
Yeah, dude.  You need to get off there before you get too invested. I know you got a lot of time clocked already, but you probably want to just cut your losses.
---
warrior tank here. exactly my experience.
---
Pretty much anything at the level 35ish range.  Gorillas are actually pretty good.  They have items that vendor for 6s and 3s each.
---
I got 10 days played in the first two weeks and up to 11.5 days played since.  Im not judging him in jealous.  Wish I had more time to take off lol.
---
Hi,
---
I'm happy that you found a place when you can get 100g in 7 hours.
---
I've got some questions though. How is it possible? I've got herb + skin myself and I went there to farm, but the monsters drop heavy and medium leather. These don't sell well on the AH for me, so I just vendor them. It's only the thick leather that's worth like 6-7 silver a piece on my server. As such, I'm grinding lv 38-40 mobs with a 20-25% chance to drop thick leather. My estimate is 3-4 gold an hour at most.

I had the Edgemasters Handguards drop on my 46 rogue. Made 400g in 15 seconds. Just do that 4head
---
&gt; Just had two guildies quit to return to retail because they (dps) couldn't find a ZF group fast enough at 10am .
---
This is a valid complaint though. Sometimes I just want to log in and do a dungeon, and with an irregular sleeping pattern that can be hard.
---
Really? On Gandling the other lowbie hordes always get the hell out of my way, even same level ones BUT once they have 2 people or someone significantly higher level then they are very brave to gank :D. For a fair 1v1 they are complete pussies.
---
Ja
---
It takes an age to set up initially, but it is so worth it.
---
If you see a troll warrior tank, you know he is a PvE tank. Orcs are USALLY just going through the motions so they can PvP.
---
Talking tina is another classic TZ. The one your referencing was also parodied in the original simpsons treehouse of horrorb
---
Soylent Green reference..
---
I do play on Mirage Raceway and I do miss seeing the hunter called "ArmsWarrior" with his wolf pet "Worgen Druid" running around :D
---
Sometimes you just get unlucky, a couple of parries and a miss and suddenly the frost bolts start flying and you have fuck all aggro or rage to do anything about it...
---
if you go balls to the wall as soon as the charge is done, and pull aggro, don't be too shocked.
---
if YOU are attacking the skull, but some other numnut is attacking something else, they have to split the tanking evenly between the two, again meaning you may pull aggro.
---
I'll be honest, i wanted to tank instances and get good at it in classic, but every run i do turns into either the dps being super inpatient and pulling everything leading to EVERY pull being a clusterfuck, or some AoE bullshit. I haven't seen a single caster perform any CC other than Slows. 
---
I'm not the greatest tank, but it's really hard to get any practice in when everyone is so goddamn inpatient.
---
Slow down there, Arya.
---
Dito but opposite direction. 60 horde on stalagg, never had a fair fight with alliance, always been outnumbered. I never run around in a group, I'm always solo. I actually can't remember a single time I've gotten to 1v1 an alliance.
---
Skillet is what you're looking for.
---
I'm lucky that after 40 i'm going to be nothing but a shadowy corpse walking around =p
---
Not like there’s anything wrong with that tho
---
Found the boomer
---
You should not comment on a class, that you have not actually played.
---
&gt; But Druids are generally expected to be healers.  
---
No, they are not.  Druids are expected to be good at whatever role they are filling.  Druid tanks are viable in raiding.  Druid healers are viable in raiding.  Druid DPS are viable in raids.  Are they the number one pick for any of the roles?  Generally speaking, no.  But just because they aren't number 1, doesn't mean they're worthless.
---
&gt; And for 5 mans, they lack a normal resurrection spell, unlike all other healers. Which is a bit of an annoyance.... 
---
Agreed!  But it is a battle Rez! and Battle Rez's are extremely important in Raids.
---
&gt; and could result in them being turned away unless someone else has a rez 
---
Wrong.  
---
&gt;  Also in the raid scene, they lack that fast heal other healers get, 
---
True!  But irrelevant!  I can stack Regrowth, and Rejuv on you, which buys me plenty of time to get my HT off, if it's even required after I've stacked those 2 HoTs on you.  Most times, it's not required, as a Druid spec'd in Resto will have taken Improved Regrowth.  Go look it up.
---
&gt;meaning heals can be sniped from them. 
---
If the druid has been assigned MT or OT for healing, that can be an issue.  But not a serious one.  As long as the MT and OT stay up, I really don't care.  If you're not assigned MT or OT, then you're assigned the guys in your group.  No one touches your group, so sniping is not a problem
---
&gt; The other roles are of questionable quality; Bear Druid can do some tanking of dungeons 
---
Properly spec'd, and geared, Druid Tanks are every bit as good in dungeons as Warriors.
---
&gt; Cat Druid really lacks in DPS for raids 
---
Properly spec'd and geared, they do just fine filling a DPS role.  They won't be at the top of the DPS charts, but they won't be at the bottom either.
---
&gt; Boomkins have massive mana issues in any prolonged fight, as they were apparently balanced around using Innervate upon themselves, but in practice that will always go to someone else. 
---
Boomkins, just aren't worth it.  I have yet to see one in Classic....
---
&gt; However, Druids are great to level, and at least one is always wanted for Raids due to their Innervate and their 30 min cd Battle Rez 
---
Raids, (20 man), usually want at the very least, 2 Druids.  3 is common.  In the larger raid, (40 man), 3 to 5 is common.  
---
At the end of the day, Druids are extremely viable at all levels of play.  They may not be the very best in any of the 3 roles, but they can certainly hold their own in any of the 3 roles.
---
The incredibly dumb, like OP. Someone who would equip a downgrade instead of just selling it. In this specific instance, it’s a max level rogue stat stick, and a good one at that. But as a hunter item, it’s fucking terrible.
---
I got my mount shortly after hitting 40.  I haven't bought skills since 30 and have 3 silver left to my name, but I got the mount.
---
the crazy thing is, if you play an MMO with an actually decent community, shit like this is almost never broken, to the point that anyone who does ends up getting fucked long term because of it. 
---
but it's WoW and there's people like you.
---
Also, combat is pretty good for pvp if your cooldowns are up.
---
I just shred people with rush
---
Right? You couldn’t pay me to fish as a kid.

Now? I am going to start my mornings with an hour of fishing up nightfin in feralas. It’s so soothing and helps me relax before work. Plus the flight there from moonglade is long enough to take the dog out and a quick shower
---
The addon exists and it’s appropriately called “flight time”
---
Nothing like having a mob dodge your sunder, resist taunt, parry mocking blow, and miss over power while DPS blows all cool downs before you even get an auto attack in.

jesus titty fucking christ im so glad im not encountering groups like this. Ive got a 42 priest and a 35 shammy and this is the first bit of ninja looting ive seen so far. If needing on BoE's was discussed prior to a dungeon id be out of the group faster than you can blink. It was a huge upgrade, but no matter how big the upgrade, need takes priority over greed always, and you dont NEED to sell it for gold, you'd just like to so you dont have to work on professions or farm anything.
---
What did we learn today kids?
---
Hyperbole is fun, YAY!!!
---
I don't find 5000 g on retail useful.
---
Yes, perfectly acceptable and should be the norm.
---
You are grouping with braindeads otherwise, or redditors apparently.
---
You can disable the unit frames you don't want you use....
---
Until you go to raid that is
---
I'm glad you got a kick out of it :D
---
Whenever I see a mage doing that bullshit I just have to think, all you kids watching streamers thinking this is how you play. I miss 2005 when everyone wasn’t watching someone do a trick to level faster and everyone just had fun doing it
---
It still means he did the dungeons, which (at this point) should translate to being slightly ahead of the curve. How he cleared, i.e. Scholo, is beyond me.
---
I wanna see if I can get this to work with the dwarf jump kick part of the dance.
---
Pretty sure the gnome and night elf rogues I met aren't lawful anything.
---
Someone already has hand of rag, im forever behind
---
My first experiences tanking BRD have been a nightmare trying to hold aggro on packs of up to 5 trash when mages just run in and start aoeing right away.  At this point I just try to hold onto the elite mobs and let the dps deal with the non elites on their own.
---
I took the most logical position based on the fact that was presented to me.
---
Yep, I’ll be perfectly fine and run by people and we’re cool. Some jackanape will hit me, I try hitting them back and the seven horde I’ve been previously cool with will immediately start murdering me.
---
Is that the new dance you buy from the shop?
---
Genocide plus copious amounts of collateral damage.
---
wow that proc would be incredible on a rogue
---
I don't get this. You aren't getting gold out of the spot unless you take a tip for the info. Like, if you want a piece of that devilsaur leather, go grind to 300. Then you can have all 15g. If you don't want to do that, why bitch about a free gold?
---
Honestly very few epics are worth buying off the AH, especially while levelling. Applying opportunity cost to that logic it makes the most sense for everyone to need on BoE epics.
---
Could you elaborate why she's getting behind in school? She graduated with almost only A’s and after 9th grade, school is not mandatory and alot of people takes a sabbatical year to do other stuff.
---
Just ignore his chats. You can always say you had the combat log open instead of your chat window.
---
Sorry you clearly have a bias
---
&gt;And for what purpose?
---
To waste 5s of their money. You don't need to make a serious effort, just stand still and throw instant dots. It won't look like going down with fight, rather spitting in their general direction.
---
When you go afk they don't only win you ingame, they also win irl because they forced you to physically stop playing. To gankers getting people to logout is the ultimate goal.
---
I'm assuming you're one of those people who often wonders why gankers gank when they get no ingame reward from it. Prepare to be even more amazed once dishonorable kills are implemented and they'll go out of their way to gather as much dishonor as possible.
---
some of them sound awesome, will grab them - thx!

Layering has nothing to do with the capacity of a server...

Warlocks have to apply the secret joestar technique
---
As someone who loves Druid and wants to agree with you, I do worry about how those logs will look as players continue to gear and future content is released.
---
Does a Phase X Druid still compete in numbers with a Phase X Mage/Hunter/Warlock is the real question for me.
---
On a pvp server 90% of fights aren't fair.

Do all goblins flirt with you?

Listen to this story: 
---
 Im in a mountain near the barrens doing quest minding my own business, a level 22 rouge attacks me ( im alliance ) i die.
---
Next time i respawn and camp that spot as night elf warrior , i see that same rouge again, i dick him down and log out.
---
Slept like baby last night.
---
Health per mana. The higher it is, and the less healing required overall, the less downtime you have.
---
LUL u maaaad brooo? Meanwhile we are killing every horde in sight in searing gorge including flight master. lmao. You horde filth will be eradicated from Azeroth.
---
not always you got to know both your cloth, and your bandages.
---
Linen and wool are worth more as just cloth.
---
Silk is worth more as Silk bandage or Heavy silk bandage.
---
Mageweave is worth more as Mageweave bandage but lose money on Heavy mageweave.
---
I just added a new column to the far left so you can mark once you have bought (or otherwise obtained) a recipe so you can filter those out too. If you take a copy of the list, just mark it with an X or a Y/N type thing so you can remove those from the list ad filter out as you go.
---
Ehh you can totaly see your healing with that addon. I've went into the settings and turned off everything but healing and it works great.
---
First french server screenshot I've seen here in quite a while, feels nice

I wish i had more time off to smoke weed. People will still judge tho.

hey, I have this quest, I know what I’m doing tonight
---
Like the musical? All i know is that is a lovely fishstick
---
It's the same at max level. Mages AoEing 2 mobs for slightly higher dps at the expense of their entire mana pool meaning an overall slower run because they have to recuperate.  
---
I know just pressing frostbolt is boring, but come on.

Stealthy motherfuckers for their size.

Obviously. The point was that DSDLDK was trying to say WoW is just the same as any other hobby (I guess not including ones you can monetize), and you attempted to differentiate them.

It's just another hobby. It's all in how you prioritize your time for that hobby.

To be fair, if companies actually cared about their employees AND their customers, it'd be a decent job. I'd love to be a career cs rep if I was working on a product I care about, in a company that cares about me. Unfortunately companies give as much of a shit about their cs reps as they do about their customers (which is none whatsoever beyond milking them dry).
---
UBI would maybe force them to improve... or just replace everyone with shitty robots, probably more likely.
---
Toss a stun or shackle or slow them while he’s pulling. There’s a lot you can do to stagger their kill time and mess them up.
---
I don’t get why people in this game don’t want to group up.... was in a situation yesterday where 3 of us were waiting for the quest spawn and I did say/group up? and they just ignored me, tagged the spawn as soon as it showed up and then left after they were done, so I had to wait for the next spawn. What even is the point if we’re all waiting for the same thing, I don’t get it.
---
You do realise *I* struggle to find mobs as well? Mages aren't running some sort of bloody mafia where we keep them all for ourselves.
---
Fisihing my friend its everyone's cash cow

Just basic sword spec combat rogue, make sure you keep 100% uptime on SnD and get a swing timer add-on, use your instant attacks right when you finish your swing. Instant attacks can proc sword spec so it will reset your swing timer, ideally you want to do it the instant you finish a swing so you don't miss potential procs.
---
To be fair, Undead Rogue is the official sweaty ganking class.
---
Found a \[Flurry Axe\]. Currently listed for 400g BO, 350 bid on Zandalar Tribe (EU). It's listed on a lot of sites as BIS for dps orc warriors. Should I sell it now to the tryhards or wait for the economy to settle a bit, more gold to flow in to the economy, more people hitting 60 and people buying their mount?
---
This guy lol
---
Well get some tissues then!
---
By default, greed all. 
---
If it is main spec bis, need. 
---
If you think you could use it or it is a minor upgrade, wait until you're sure no one needs it and then need. 
---
If you think you can sell it for $$$ and you need you are, by definition, a PoS (unless group agrees on all Need ofc)

Well crafting the boat is a poor argument, airplanes need to be crafted to, and if after the crafting of it it runs on completely green energy then it is better than planes already, human waste produced on a boat is the same waste that would be produced on an airplane so that's irrelevant.
---
You do you, mate. I personally agree with your stance. I was tanking as ret for a few instances (dm, stocks, and sm) and because I didn't have consecrate, I was marking targets and taking it slow. It was really hard when mages and hunters were just running off and pulling shit, and getting testy with me when I dont have a taunt. 
---
Keep up the good fight, man. You have my sympathies.
---
Hence the I'm in ZF for reference - my mages literally make about that much 35 water with one cast.

Climate alarmism is a religion. It has original sin, unquestionable truths, and if you go against it you're a heretical liar. As well as patron saints, Bill Nye the engineer guy for example.

It's sad how cringey this subreddit is with the hate. If someone else had posted this, it'd have hundreds or even thousands of upvotes. But since it's Asmongold, it needs to be downvoted to hell because "Asmongold bad."

"Climate alarmism"

How to throw any legitimacy you have right out the window 101

I dunno, I FLEW through the late 30s. Did 37-40 on Sunday which had a few breaks throughout the day. Then before I knew it I was halfway through 42 last night. The pace really started picking up when I went to STV at 38.
---
&gt; Diminishing someone's gaming choices because they have less time to play, or prefer convenience, or simply don't like the journey over the endgame is unfair.
---
I can say whatever I want about the part of the market that ruined an entire genre of games.
---
No one is saying the climate is ending the world in 20 years. She is fighting for a better future for her children. It is a worthwhile fight.
---
If you studied science at all you could understand the basics of climate change. If you could do a little scientific reading you’d see that humans are having more and more impact on the climate.
---
I’m a fairy conservative person, but I think taking care of this is important. I don’t know why people are against working on this aside from being pushed right wing propaganda. It doesn’t hurt anyone but rich oil execs to explore cleaner energy.

A good resource for macros: https://macrohub.io/macros/Rogue
---
You had 700 points, not just 7 skills. You could take 7 skills to max level of 100, or split the points any way you liked, as long as your total skill points were 700. Some skills were very useful at 20 points, some at 50, so many people split the points to make useful builds out of 10-12 skills.
---
It depends on the armor of the mob, but if we say you crit for 600 on a mob with 0 armor and you train the next level which has an additional 60 damage
---
It would add 60 damage, which is the multiplied by:
---
* 2 from a crit
---
* 1.2 from opportunity
---
* 1.02 from murder
---
So it would add 146 damage making your ambush hit for 746
---
 No need to download anything. Just type this in chat: /console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"    
---
it will unfortunately make shamans pink instead of a dark blue though
---

---
Pally rogue could be difficult for actually playing at the same time, but affliction or demo warlock would do well. Only thing I could see for rogue is you can stealth around nicely to scout before the big dumb paladin crusades in.
---
Oh look another butthurt mage defending their class.
---
We get it, this meta loves mages.
---
I would recommend you save for your mount and grind sm for silk then later on zf and higher level dungeons drop mageweave. You can disenchant any greens you get
---
Sorry, but just like gender in real life, your characters appearance is immutable.

Anytime tanking comes up, half the comments are "I don't taunt off DPS if they pull aggro, you've got to let them die to teach them a lesson."
---
When that's the attitude that's fostered, you can't be surprised when someone lives it.
---
Crit dmg multipliers, talent bonouses increase that by a lot.
---
My priest is 38 and has the same professions, and I'm up to 160g right now just from questing and selling greens, looting everything, and running dungeons.

Emperor doesn't drop HoJ, at least until a later phase. It's currently HoJ from Angerforge and Force of Will from Emperor, exclusively.

It clearly lists hoj as a drop from him?

There's one on my server called Mailbox. I think his ad said something about being able to send hate mail to people anonymously. 😂😂
---
I'm 43 and I use weakauras...
---
Take 20 minutes out of your game time to learn it, it really is worth the investment. Once you get it, it's easy. Pick a display style, create the weakaura, select the conditions under which it should be displayed, move it where you want, tweak the display options, marvel at your ingenuity.
---
For example, I'm having a hell of a time getting used to paladin seal/judge/seal, and the return to 5m blessings. I have two auras that look at my buffs and if there's nothing that matches "seal of" or "blessing of" it puts up some flashing text what tells me they're missing.
---
On retail I have auras for just about all my classes. Any reactive abilities that the stock interface doesn't inform me about, and even some it does so that I don't have to pay attention to my action bars.
---
Cool stuff. How about whirlwind quest. I imagine a sick drawing of some warriors in the foreground and towering over them a huge silhouette of the cyclonian guy. I know you have a certain style and maybe this doesn’t fit that. I’m just talking to myself I guess. Anyways, keep up the good work!

Nothing to be alarmed about.

So I just made it to Hillsbrad Foothills last night. Was a lovely change to that of Silverpine Forest. I love going to new areas, it always suprises me. I find WoW classic's art style beautiful, I also find retail the complete opposite.
---
IF you open up on it before at least 2 sunders, you are a bad dps.
---
Note also that STV has a massive level range for quests.  You will be in and out of STV many times as you level from 30 to 45+.
---
She won’t? She’s already such a recognizable face she became a meme on a WoW subreddit. I couldn’t tell you one climate change scientist who has brought half as much attention to this.
---
Fishing? do fish sell for a lot of gold at higher levels or is there another way?
---
It does go both ways, but that’s not at all the point here. 
---
If you’re a dps who can’t follow kill priority, tank is never going to be able to hold threat on more than maybe two mobs at a time and the run _will_ go excruciatingly slow because now the tanks job has converted to baby sitting and the healers job went from “heal tank” to stop dps children from killing the group.
---
You expect me to walk? Do I look like some shitty warrior? I rolled a mage for a reason.
---
* Play the game (gray value increases more and more with level)
---
* Fishing oilies and firefins, maybe even greater sagefish
---
* Long term - fishing/herbalism/alchemy and doing many different pots for AH (frost oil, free action potion, limited invis, swiftness pot, moongose, arcane elixir, str/stam pots, greater stoneshield, shadow oil, normal and greater fire prot pots, arcane prot pots, in future also nature and shadow prot, shadow and fire spellpower).
---
its cheap to pick up from the AH to fill some slots and kinda decent in a armor+stamina way. Sure they are way better drops and even some quest rewards, but for a fresh 60 still needing stuff from BRD I wouldn't get my hopes up for Draconian Deflector, Gyths Helmet and Deathbone.
---
Well... If it is a good joke then yes?!
---
You could say that about literally any Topic. Some jokes are just not funny. The Topic doesn't matter.
---
dung is not a great slang term for dungeon lol
---
Yep, 2/3 rogues and a priest hanging out outside Booty Bay and just chain stunning/fear/mind control so you cant fight back even as 10-15 levels higher. Its aids and obnoxious, but very satisfying when you muster a couple of extra allies from town to come smash their skulls.
---
I agree. As a rogue, should I get the loot from locked chests in dungeons since I am the only one who can open it? Same applies here imo.
---
Depends if you need the gold now or if you can wait. Do you have plans for how you would spend the gold now if you had it? Otherwise wait.
---
I'm sorry, but I don't think China is going to see us "going green" and think they should do the same. Environmentalism isn't new, not like they've missed the memo every time before.

Druids rule!
---
I do find him and his stream quite entertaining at times, but the amount of Asmon posts on this subreddit begins to get insufferable. It's like those magazines about celebrities like "OMG X married Y, DIVORCE?!!"
---
I like Asmon, but I don't want to read posts (and constant reposts) about his every breath.
---
Are you daft? It's literally the reason why they added stealth roof-top guards in wrath.
---
The Druid is not hard to level - especially after you get cat form but the chill experience of levelling a hunter is just so nice. 
---
I sent my pet to attack, kill, and set it to the next. I can then loot/skin the mob I just killed and go and assist my pet. Rinse and repeat. There is so little downtime and risk. Really cool. 
---
The downside is being 1 roll where Druid’s can do it all. :)
---
Alternatively, pull unrelated mobs to them from behind. Preferably ranged or elites. They can always farm somewhere else, you can't.
---
oh damn 160 thats nuts. I feel like at the rate im going i wont make it to 40 with 100 because im only really sitting at like 5g rn

ok thanks!

Call the whaaambulance

No, it says "Destruction spells", and the dots are Affliction. An exception is Immolate, the initial spell can trigger Aftermath. However, the dot effect of Immolate is not considered a spell itself, so it can't trigger it.
---
"Muh alarmism, its just to push regulations and taxes on us!!!1!"

See, I can do it too! How fun.

Oh man I love whiny babies about mage AoE farming. I'll completely be clearing an area of mobs and they'll beg me for invites.
---
Yeah sure man let me just cut my exp in half while you do literally nothing. Great deal.
---
Anyway the rest of my farm is in instances now and since I'm at 3 days 14 hours at level 52 I say I've done well despite sorry attempts at griefing.
---
&gt;Yikes

We can just change the name of our current state when evidence that doesn't support our claim comes out, like how global warming died out when they realized the temperature in north America hasn't increased since 2004, shattering their predictions.

I am just going through a lot right now man.
---
that's why I said "there are bad players in all roles". People in here are just quick to judge shit dps players but don't you dare say something about shitty tanks. That's a downvote.
---
You might think you are doing them a favour, but holding there hand so much while leveling is only going to be negative for them later on.
---
I'd personally sell it ASAP to fund my epic mount. I think the price will only go up a bit, and 350-400g is worth more NOW rather than after the economy has settled.

---
When did I proclaim a solution? I'm simply condemning your refusal to acknowledge a problem in the first place.
---
The world isn't ending. Its not going to explode into a ball of fire in ten years. To say that consistent (and worsening) worldwide scientific consensus is just "alarmism" is simply wrong, though, and there *will* be awful and ongoing/permanent consequences if more isnt done in increasingly small amounts of time.
---
You yourself acknowledge the issue in directing the blame to China/India, and I agree and acknowledge that they are disastrously effecting this global issue. It is much more complex to geopolitical motive entire foreign nations, however, than it is to work from within your own (especially when your own nation is supposedly democratic and respectful of its citizens desires). A significant part of the current climate protest push, is in regards to politicians and what little they're doing - wouldn't that also include foreign policy and effecting other nation's internal policies?
---
We can always be doing better, and we should. Push for other nations to drastically change (hell, a straight up revolution/regime downfall in China would be nice) but dont stop asking for our/your own politicians and institutions to actually do something too. We cant just hope that fucking totalitarian Xi Pooh will wake up tomorrow and realise he's fucking the rest of the world over constantly, or else it'll be far far too late.
---

Wow... Man lifes hard... Hope You have strenght on Your gloves. If not find an enchanter :D
---
You imply ninjaing is bad and greedy, and then say everyone should roll need on BoE...... Because you "know better" than the class that can use it.....
---
That sounds bad and greedy. Your solution to people rolling need when they want to sell things is to roll need so you can sell it instead.
---
Gnome mages are the worst. Kill on sight.

Adrenaline rush. Paired with blade flurry you can take down 2 elites by yourself before anything else dies.
---
I used to do the whole /who and whisper thing as well, but I stopped because I thought it'd be annoying if everyone adopted that method (imagine a tank trying to quest getting whispers every 2 seconds). Since it wasn't scalable, I stopped and stuck to /4. Takes a lot longer to get groups though...
---
Whenever an undead tries to gank me, I think of the 15 year old boy sitting on the other end of the computer. Tears running down his face from the abuse he just suffered, causing him to roll such a sad race. After picturing the average undead player (especially warlocks, the only reason to roll ud lock is to show off your lacking mental capacity) I just can't get myself to fight back anymore. So I just stand there and let the undead go to town, hoping this brings at least a little bit of joy in his otherwise sad and empty life.
---
Stay strong Undead Rogues ane Warlocks. Life will get better.

It’s the fastest growing meme right now.  There’s been a few posts on here with chat logs of mates bitching about aggro.

Hey everybody, look at this fucking retard!

Wait... Wives? Like plural?

At that level I think you should be able to kill the mobs in Westfall just under 1 minute. Also a good skinning spot, many of them are animals.
---
As a former Hunter in retail, I fully agree. Hunters can be pretty lame.
---
The douchebag is the guy that minds his own business and farms while getting griefed by someone for not being invited to the party?
---
Remember: people don’t owe you anything
---
Yeah hunters dont really fall off till AQ40  when lack of pet scaling starts becoming an issue. They are very competitive in MC and BWL with the right talents/gear. If we are talking TBC hunters are pretty much top DPS throughout.
---
You can deeps as disciprine.
---
And for the incessant tweaker, there's PitBull, which has been my unit frames of choice for many a year.
---
Only level 52 right now and have around 300g. First big goal would be my epic mount which has a set price so buying power wont change that I guess. Ill wait till ill get to level 60 and keep monitoring the price. Thanks guys!
---
Nah, that sounds like the tank or your fault lol. You’re either unnecessarily healing before he has decent threat (meaning right at the start of the heal) or he’s just tunneling a single mob. Tanking is a joke in classic. It’s just practically nonexistent in retail.
---
I dont think so. Dont quote me on that, but I think higher rank just means higher damage (in turn higher mana and damage)
---
Demo shout being bugged for so long has ruined a ton of mages at max level. They think they can just aoe right away and not pull threat. Really tired of constantly having to emergency heal them especially the ones who don't spec into iceblock/frost barrier. Started just letting them die. After a few runs back they usually get the message.
---
Okay, I am very sorry to hear that.
---
Lets say someone gets a guild charter for "Guild A" and doesn't have 9 signatures. Can someone else also get a guild charter for the same "Guild A" name? If so, if they get the 9 signatures first and register it, can they get the guild name?
---
Basically, does a guild name get reserved when you get the charter, or is first-come first-serve with the register?
---
Huh, I disagree with most other posters. Roll ahead if it's BoE. Everyone should have the right to the gold. Otherwise you will get a lot of people saying "oh I need that" just to get the confirm.

Haha I was talking for us gamer dudes in plural 😂
---
No, it doesn't screw anyone over. The net result is the same. Just think of a BOE blue or epic as being a big pile of gold on the ground. You roll for the gold. If a player wants to buy that boe from whoever wins it, they can. It maximizes the value of the BOE this way.
---
People who got their mounts and professions leveled up already. After that, you're not getting upgrades fast enough for gold to be an issue.
---
if you watch LFG there is usually a group at SM that is looking for a tank or heals with summons.  But the reality is, the run is less than 10 min from southshore.

I haven't seen anyone saying they don't taunt on aggro pulls. They're talking about dps overtly pulling and initiating  packs over and over.
---
While I don't literally agree that you should stand there as a tank, I get the premise.
---
Between this comment and the paladin tank thinking a warrior tank in valor was a sign of competence I don't know what's more rich. If you don't understand the level of hilarity in this paragraph, you need not post. 
---
This thread is filled with self inflated egos.
---
Lmao..
---
I feel like everything you just said is backwards. 
---
Leveling warrior is pretty objectively the worst experience of any class. The downtime, lack of self-sustainability are rough. Both druids and Paladins can tank totally on par with warriors for 5 mans. 
---
At 60, warriors become the best tanks (some would say the only real option) and undeniably the highest DPS class.
---
Guy thinks he's the only person in existence to ever get ganked, but when he did he cries to Reddit like it's gonna do anything.
---
&gt;Submitting to a mental deficient 15 yo 
---
oh no no no no HAHAHAHA
---
Not sure about the other stuff but the ninja loot thing was him taking an item he as the main tank should’ve gotten anyways from some dos warrior who only rolled for the meme
---
Don't let other people ruin your class for you. I see a lot of Warlocks doing dumb shit too. Just gotta fight back against the stereotype.
---
!remindme 4 hours
---
Well yeah but you can't classify a game based on a small portion of it. That's like saying Spyro is a skateboarding game.
---
I saw a hunter last night with the name "Ibeatmypet" and his pet's name was "Plzzcallpeta". I wish I had grabbed a screenshot, but was too busy laughing.
---
Yes please.
---
Seems like there is an obvious compromise here
---
So does this mean all of us lock mains are the mvps now?
---
Sorry, maybe you're one of the good ones.
---
I was under the impression that this sub is less of a circlejerk than /r/wow, but boy was I wrong.
---
Lel xD
---
Soo it is a game where People just pick what they think Looks fun.
---
You are gonna have both in both factions.
---
But constantly seeing People like you Q.Q about PVP when having rolled on a pvp Server just makes my day - everday xD
---
I mean you even Play a mage... You could probably just Smash your face on whatever button you have frostbolt bound to and still manage to kill both the 60 and the other alliance guy.
---
What is you Problem here? Waahh I rolled on a pvp Server and now People don't just want to have fair 1v1 against one of the strongest 1v1 classes in the game **wipe away tears**
---
Sounds like you're just bad at the game.   Maybe you should've rolled on a PvE server if you can't PvP.
---
I mean a good deal of classic players are people from retail who never played classic era tanks and are just trying to chainpull, and people who bought the game off the hype and never played wow, period. Those players are expected to be bad specifically around WC level range. Usually people tend to get the hang of it around lvl 40 ish though.
---
Hammers is where it’s at.  Hammers murder more people than ARs.
---
Average player is 34. Only cuz of all the level 5 bank alts. The big pack of casual levelers seem to be around 38-45.
---
Put him on the ignore list and move on. It’s low level stuff anyways so you’re not losing much and now you won’t group with him again.
---
Do you take your screenshots in 240p or something? I honestly can't see shit
---
So you don't have a solution, don't know what to do, and think we aren't doing good enough? The only solution is annexation of nations that refuse to take action against climate change, but by the way? I didn't say I was against climate change. Everyone in here made that assumption because I disagree with some terrified brat who constantly contradicts herself. "I'm not trying to scare people." Ten seconds later at her main speech at the UN. "I want you to feel the terror I feel every day.." 
---
She is nothing but a scared child screaming at the moon. Let the adults work on solutions.
---
Ps. Consensus is not a scientific term.
---
No comrade, its OUR planet.
---
Dungeons are a nice way to bridge the level gaps between zones. Some of the longer dungeons can easily give you a level or more if you go through the effort of grabbing their respective quests and the blue gear that you get from bosses and quests can actually be a nice little boost to your overall leveling speed once you get back into the open world!
---
"shrekt"
---
That's fine. However, that isn't what this was framed as. There was an assumption you're behind on gold and need to catch up. However, you don't. Worst case you hit 60 and still behind on spells, and you catch up faster then since quests give you more gold at max level. Time is a commodity. In this case you're trading time now for time later, whereas your power-level, time to mount, etc... will be roughly the same, the only difference is you're now going to be levels behind.
---
...the thriiiilaaaarrr \*stab\*  "uuuaaghh" the thrillaaaaarrrr
---
And the most popular ones got integrated into the game, eventually becoming what is now BfA.  So.....
---
Man of culture
---
Bruh how is that the most iconic Shaman spell in the game???? It's obviously stormstrike or chain lightning. As someone who's played classic , cats , and bfa shaman. BFA shaman is a bastardization of the class. No shocks on enh? A rage bar? Come on
---
Yeah if people want mobs they can just pull them, if a mage is killing his own mobs he doesn't owe you anything. This sub is a bit weird
---
I don't care about your AOE farming, but you seem to be as narcissistic as they come lol. Every other word you type is I, me, my etc. 
---
Also, I'm curious if you're aware of the irony of pre-preemptively complaining about "whiny babies?"
---
I just got back into classic after playing vanilla for a few months and completely falling off, I've tried to read up on the evolution of retail and how different it is and I don't think I could handle how much there is to do. I have maybe an hour a night to play right now, few more on the weekends, and logging on to crush a few boars in dun morough while my gf watches bravo is A-OK with me, I just love the feeling of seeing other folks popping around town, doing their own thing.
---
&gt;bad
---
&gt;die to 60 @ lvl 30
---
&gt;"BAD"
---
And then there's me, the mage that just wants to run dungeons as normal to get loot. It is annoying when people want you to aoe spell cleave everything. I find it's easier to make your own group than join one.
---
Truly, WoW brings families together and teaches good discipline. I applaud you.
---
Thank you! How do you know when other guilds are planning on raiding? Any tips for that?
---
Nope, its not coming. Better learn to love yourself the way you created yourself. This is wow not real life.
---
Ohh i thought You have more than 1 lol. :D
---
Paladin tanking was so painfully un-fun for me it's what convinced me to roll a Warrior again in Classic. 
---
Having actual AoE threat was wonderful, absolutely undeniably wonderful. 
---
But getting threat only from holy damage feels clunky as shit and means half your "This seems good!" talents are garbage (looking at you 1h spec). And lacking a taunt meant anytime something dumb happened I just kinda watched it happen, if Judgment wasn't enough, wasn't much I could do. Just felt like a weaker Warrior. 
---
Ultimately though, what killed it for me though was the drinking. Having a stop, pull the run over, and sit on my ass drinking as the *tank* just felt so painfully un-fun I couldn't handle it. That's a personal thing, and maybe you can gear around it, but being unable to chain pull because I needed a quickie sippy made my skin crawl.
---
I don't know for paladins. As a priest. Every 10th level when I go to train, my trainer or somebody near him is offering me a quest.
---
How tf did you get to 36 in a day 16h on a rogue? I need these secrets
---
no
---
Also, if you’re playing in a guild at a high level, they want a wolf.
---
Just watch me ninja a Warden Staff from a druid because "i need stam for pvp"
---
You could use ambush or garrote there instead of SS then.
---
Mage is currently top across all classic servers. Rogue is up there, but I think it's #3 currently (for people &gt; level 5)
---
It's controversial on this subreddit, but mobs in dungeons just don't do enough damage, so it's fine if all the mobs aren't hitting the tank.
---
Yes, it's the pinnacle of wrecking.
---
Mine did that too I was so confused
---
And how big would those corps be without customers, hmm?
---
I'd say yes unless it's BIS or pretty close to BIS. So rolling against a druid on Warden Staff would be a dick move.
---
More than 1 WoW chars of course 🤩
---
That’s pretty good, lol!
---
Agreed. I never got on the hate train for any class before now.
---
You're not wrong but
---
Hyperbole such as "Any mage who casts a single Blizzard in a dungeon is streamer-watching scum who needs to go back to retail"?
---
Wait until thrash blade / mirah’s song imo
---
As much as I dislike your style of play, I get it, more power to you. But if those mobs your grinding happen to be part of a quest, you should be a bro and invite them. Sure, your XP will be split, but with the speed of your AoE, that person you’ve invited will be out of your hair in no time and you can get back to solo grinding.
---
Why the red light?
---
Ah yes, the old 'learn from dying to people 20 levels higher than you' skill. Useful in all of no situations.
---
If he can get a perditions blade or core hound tooth it's a good opportunity to go combat daggers but ya this is an amazing off hand for a furry warrior.
---
Just type /roll automatically is to 100
---

&gt; I gank

&gt; pvp
---
pick one
---
Imagine being this worked up about a game
---
Hang on so he kept dying but you couldn't do the quest?  Can't have it both ways.
---
I saw some streamers using an addon to hotswap trinkets right on the action bar, seemed really convinient but I can't find it, does anyone know where I can find it? I think it was sodapoppin I saw using it
---
This is so true it hurts. Polarizing opinions generate traffic
---
Oppa Gangnam style
---
Because it improves the experience, and fixes an odd disconnect.  I'm not a classic purist in that regard, though I understand some people don't want anything changed at all.
---
I watched a mage "AOE Clearing" in an area where there was a quest drop I was trying for. I kept trying to get an invite from them but they refused, and promptly died  to the mob that was clearly too much for them. a few minutes later i saw them back, and they did the exact same thing and died. I don't understand.
---
That makes more sense, but even then, why would they do it when the healer and other mage were drinking at half mana? I guess they were that dense.
---
What was the problem exactly? Just damage the mob whichever the tank wants you to focus down first. It's not that difficult or particularly stressful.
---
When you have at least 9% hit you can switch, the more the better though
---
lil person big views
---
Who types out /roll 100? Just type /roll.
---
I cant decide between playing warlock or druid as main aah! So hard..Warlock is 37 ,druid 20 lvl atm
---
Stuff like this is my biggest pet peeve in classic. had a rogue 6 levels higher than me try and shame me with his damage meter. he was attacking first and taking aggro, while i was waiting for the tank. felt zero remorse kicking him from the group.
---
People aren't very smart
---
&gt;but it's not difficult, there's nothing complicated about it or about what you need to do.
---
then you aren't doing it right. Compared to healing or dpsing, aoe tanking on a warrior is surgery.
---
You got it.  
---
I own guns from every culture around the world.   I have Arabic guns, French guns, Austrian guns, Chinese guns, you name a culture, I own a gun from there.  
---
&lt;3
---
Huh, never thought about it like that...
---
Personally I’m in the same boat. But I have an under-leveled Herbalism and Skinning. So I’ve got that going for me. I see two additional ways that you could also do:
---
(1) Chain run dungeons for grays and items to sell. It’s slow work but it’ll be a decent chunk of change per run. If you’ve a tank friend or guildees let them know you’ll be down for XP runs. Plus is you can change the cloth you get to bags if those sell well in your economy. Or just sell the cloth itself. 
---
(2) Level Fishing/Cooking and sell the fish/food you make. It’ll be tedious but it’s honestly the only other gathering profession other than dropping Enchant/Tailoring.
---
This exact thing happened to me around lvl 39 as a warrior lmao...
---
People saw joker's aoe farming and they think blizzard is the best spell to exist, it's hilarious. Blizzarding caster mobs, good luck with that.
---
It's faster to just grab the loot.  You can trade it after if you're concerned someone might steal it in that fraction of a second.
---
It does matter if you’re in ZF. The new water spells make 2 the level you get them. So 10 casts per stack. You can normally do 3-4 in a full mana bar. 
---
Every level after that it increases by 2 per level
---
A level 48 mage makes 20 per cast of their best water. A level 50 mage makes 2
---
Why can't you farm somewhere else?
---
Nah it doesn’t i used that addon and it doesn’t give details like that
---
Maybe she just cares about something? It’s not that hard. They are also making fun of her for having autism which is fucked. Just go look on the Donald. They are fucked in the head and a lost cause.
---
They said they saw high latency on one out of ten tests and haven’t heard back past that, I think they’ve changed our connection though because the internet cut out in the middle of the day, checked the router and we had a new IP and the PPP and DSL connections had reset too
---
Seriously, he just argued against himself and lost. Let's just run an experiment.
---
&gt;Bfa was a bastardization of the game that the boys loved. 
---
Check.
---
&gt; Huge mechanical and gameplay changes caused tons of players to outright quit.  
---
Check
---
&gt; Wow classic was a major move that played out well because it's what the majority wants. 
---
So far, so good. Yeah.. I'm thinking maybe they are related.
---
Does it only play locally or can everyone hear it
---
To each his own. To me time having fun is not time wasted. Hobbies are important for most people. It’s a dangerous comparison between productivity and leisure because most people need leisure. If you are the type of person who wants to work 100 weeks and only stop working to sleep then that’s fine, but most people need breaks.
---
Can someone explain the system of resets for raids? I know MC reset this morning, but does onyxia also reset that time?
---
And how does your lockout work in classic? If I PUG with a group up until domo can I join another raid that is also at domo or is it tied to the raid leader? And what if I group for onyxia but wipe and leave? Am I free to run onyxia later with a group because I didn’t kill a boss yet?
---
Oh absolutely. Too many DPS play the metres instead of the game, stressed out and annoys every healer and tank I know.
---
It is so easy to have nice, smooth, relaxed runs... but not enough to do that, gotta be the top number.
---
Last raids I ran I straight up banned damage metres. I mean people could use them but they weren't to be linked or talked about in the raid.. they were great for checking that everyone was doing what they were supposed to and to identify any problems, but too many people wanted nothing but that number one spot and would happily wipe the raid to get it.
---
Yes, not sure how much is the cap where you stop needing weapon skill.
---
Use Elvui, from tukui.org, problem solved 😀
---
I always have top or near top dps as hunter.
---
You need more than 9% hit for your white hits to stop missing. So on a rogue hit chance is rarely wasted.
---
You can just buy beans and ferment it yourself, not that hard.
---
I’d say that’s more of an early level Warlock thing than a DPS thing. A rogue your level would basically be spamming the same two abilities, likewise for a mage or Hunter.
---
At your level you should only really be focusing on casting corruption on mobs, wanding and throwing the odd direct spell depending on how much mana you have. It changes slightly the more you level up.
---
I do this, too. It's amazing how greed kills in this game. :')
---
That said, if someone accidentally pulls, I'll be happy to help them out. But I can tell the difference.
---
i have a shadow priest ate lvl 31 same server and now i'm leveling a warrior and it's very different, it's much more dificult i'm dying all the time
---
do you have any tips pls?
---
Speaking as a primary tank, someone who's tanked through almost all progression content when it was relevant in Vanilla-
---
The unbridled entitlement, and self-congratulatory arrogance of tanks continues to be the most inane thing to me. 
---
Healers have it too, of course, but my God, is it bad with tanks. Combine that with the "I play a tank because I'm an alpha male!" dropkicks and I almost want to play a tank just so I don't have to deal with other tanks. 
---
I mean, this is what, the *third* Tanks R Hard, We R Da Best circlejerk thread TODAY? Or maybe I missed some others, no matter, there'll be another 3 tomorrow too! All filled with the same fart-huffing garbage as your post. 
---
Personally, I can't wait for Ony and MC PuGs to start being more common, so this sub can fill up with mediocre tanks slapping each other on the back and telling each other that "Stance Dancing" requires more than a room temperature IQ and the bare minimum of ability to play your class.
---
Unpopular Opinion: There's a lot of really, really bad tanks out there.
---
I remember getting this from some ogres in STV on retail back in the day. Thought it was so funny I tossed it in my bank and saved it for a long time.
---
If I have it I give to classes that I pass through as leveling.
---
Either 2hander or 1 hander+shield
---
Yo hit one of us up I'm sure you'd find some1 Kind enough to donate a month of gametime when Money is short again. (If it is due to Money)
---
I have plenty of gametimes and battle-net Money left from farming Gold the past 3 years on retail xD
---
Sorry no dual wielding for you. Get the Hand of Rag and pawn some noobs
---
I mean, I get it, this was a pretty common attitude back in vanilla. But we've learned a lot about the game since then, and old shitty attitudes should change with the times.
---
DPS pulls aggro = he fucked up, that’s his problem.  
---
Healer pulls aggro = that’s healing, I’m coming to save your ass ASAP!
---
It is pretty easy to hold aggro as long as I get about 2 seconds to get them all hitting me before someone attacks.
---
TBC i think
---
Shaman didn't get dual wield until TBC if I remember correctly.
---
Many (if not all) chat panel addons do that. I use PRAT.
---
Warlocks are doing the same shit with fear. Got kicked from a group as tank bc I told the warlock to stop fearing things.
---
You could roleplay it like the song A Boy Named Sue.
---
I wanted to break the circlejerk a little bit after my last few dumb memes but not I'm thinking I should report my own post for the amount of salt in these comments
---
Plus you could probly have 3, level 60 toons before most the pack catches up if you continue like you are lol.
---
Yea , I played a mage in vanilla as well and seeing all the craze now just makes looking like the experienced knows their stuff mage really easy.
---
Shh, they can’t milk karma if they used logic.
---
Innkeepers will also tell you what dungeons are appropriate for you at your current level.
---
As a tank, I generally check Wowhead for the level of the dungeon's final boss. If it's more than 3 levels higher than you, you're going to be dealing with a lot of your hits not landing and taunts resisting.
---
This sub is a meme. It's either mage hate or bitching that anyone dares be above level 25 right now because they're ruining the experience and missing out on the journey.
---
100% 
---
All these stories about bad or rude mages.  I've never seen it.  I don't know where it's coming from.
---
Sometimes I wish TK was available.. or atleast I should be able to heal the mobs and watch them die
---
I play tank warrior so I only understand the first image
---
I just find it annoying to be seen as someone who picked a class because it's flavour of the month or really powerful at the moment, when I really just like mages.  Kind of dampens the experience. 
---
Not gonna quit playing a mage though.
---
What'd you do to level out of interest? I've at 53 and ran out of quests in Un'goro. I still haven't done Felwood.
---
HEY OP, Video games are the absolute worst Loser Habit you could have Hours &amp; hours spent on an ultimately useless skill Sitting and getting fatter and weaker and skinnier and paler Completely impaired social skills Video games make you a bottom tier subhuman. That’s you get some sun.
---
My third maraudon run on my rogue. This was the first time I saw the ring drop. In the group we were 4 player hoping the the ring to drop.   
---
When it did, I felt like saying a little prayer. My prayer was heard
---
I made a horde alt with friends (main is ally) just to mess about and have fun and all that jazz.
---
After doing all the undead starting zone quests, the people unironically saying the forsaken have done nothing wrong must be sociopaths. Some of the quests are kinda fucked up if you think about what you just did, if it wasn't for the cartoon graphics and minimal animations it would be much more obvious how your character is in no way a good being.
---
You don't need gold. I get so much fucking gold from doing high level quests normally it's embarrassing.
---
FYI I’m a Hunter main and am downvoting you for being a knob.
---
They never wind up going to the Brazilian realms cause the Brazilian realms tend to wind up dead. They just sit on a certain NA realm usually.
---
Essentially this means, if you have a ninja mentality, don't expect to ever group/raid with any prominent/serious raiding guild. People will remember your name, they will always tell the leader of your current guild how/what you really are, you may even get ganked if this knowledge extends to the other faction (I sure as hell would gank any horde who's known as ninja). If that's worth that one item to you (not you personally /u/finesse-quik), feel free.
---
Does that mean he claims to speak for the classic community?
---
And isn't it true that he helped make Classic happen?
---
Not gonna lie, anyone dumb enough to grief a rogue deserves everything they get.
---
If I’m using a shiny bauble or something similar when fishing and it expires while I have my line cast, do I still get the +fishing bonus until that “channeling” period ends?
---
So the way the nerf goes is if a 60 (or high level) is in a party with someone the xp nerf happens. What you can do to AoE level people is meet up with your friend (but don’t join their party. Have them tag all the mobs. You kill them. They get all the xp, can’t do that in a dungeon because it is a separate instance and everyone needs to be partied to be in it. But in the open world you can help “farm” xp.
---
Yeah I know for alliance it’s prebis but it’s still such a messed up thing to do IMO to take it from a warrior or rogue. And I say that as a guy who mained a hunter for the majority of my time in Vanilla. Some items are worth the drama for hunters looting like Core Hound Tooth. But if it were a paladin or enhancement shaman shit yeah go for the HoJ then since they’re meme specs. 
---
Just my opinion anyways. Luckily for horde there’s never an excuse to take HoJ as a hunter.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/cooking-recipe-items
---
Why reinvent the wheel?
---
I was a 40 broke dwarf priest also.
---
Running SM over and over worked for me.
---
Personally, I think it’s a little different when it’s a really high value BoE. If it’s just a regular blue BoE, in general, you can trade it in for another blue on the AH. It’s a 1:1 ratio, 1 drop, 1 upgrade. But one epic could easily fund 4+ upgrades. 
---
At that point, it’s a massive upgrade for everyone.
---
I'm fairly confident it's first-come first-serve when you register with all signatures.
---
I grew up playing Everquest, so just straight up grinding mobs for multiple levels at a time isnt something I mind at all. I did 31-35 at gelkis village in Desolace, and 37-40 on swamp Jaguars in swamp of sorrows
---
Oh yea for sure that too. Plus perception...
---
I still remember when blizz gave them that free trinket slot... WotLK I think? Talk about insanely op. Human rogues were steam rolling arena...
---
My friends and I are releveling on a different server because Stalagg is pretty much a PvE server at this point with how few alliance there are.
---
The game is packed, and there is a lot of competition for mobs to complete quests. This makes the leveling progression slower than people are used to. AOE farmers create huge bottlenecks that make this go even slower. It doesn’t make anyone a douchebag, but you shouldn’t be surprised if people are getting salty about it at all. If you invited them, let them get their 8 kills, they would be on their way quicker and your AOE spot would be empty faster. It is a common sense win win, you losing half xp for 2 or 3 pulls seems worth it in the long run
---
Im a horrible priest and havent found a keybind for fade yet.  At lower levels it didnt do shit, and ive only done about 5 runs at close to/max level.
---
Fuck i need to bind that.  Its a serious fucking life saver and im super fucking thankful that im a priest and have it.
---
Idk 
---
Even if he did 
---
I watch him for entertainment and let’s be real that could be entertaining
---
Does recount work as well?  I use Details as I heard it was more accurate, but I really dislike the interface.
---
I don't expect people to refuse a 3 min help in a game where everything takes forever ?
---
Try the ogres in blasted lands.
---
That shit's stupid even on RP servers. I wouldn't mind it occasionally saying something in /say, but it going off literally every time they hit the spell? Miss me with that level of stupidity.
---
This.
---
&gt; If I PUG with a group up until domo can I join another raid that is also at domo or is it tied to the raid leader?
---
Tied to raid ID, so you must join a group who have the same ID (basically the raid leader OR form your own)
---
If the group WIPES on Ony and you leave, you should not be saved to the instance, so you may return later.
---
Of course aoe tanking feels impossible when people start aoeing before you even have enough rage to hit half the mobs.
---
Horde and Alliance each have a separate questline involving this item. For Alliance it starts clicking on the item, for the Horde, it starts by talking to a guy in Orgrimmar, though you can pick it up beforehand.
---
Think i've done Mara like once on every char i ever made. Fuck going back there! This time i did have to go back for the ring.. So on my second run in drop and i won it over the other 3 that wanted it. Feels good never having to go back unless i make a new char.
---
A BoE epic drops off a dungeon mob. It is a caster weapon called The Magicman's Didgeridoo. It is worth 300g. The mage can use it.
---
Meanwhile, the rogue cannot use it. But he can sell it for 300g. There is a BoE epic rogue weapon on the AH called The Pokey Shanker that he wants and it is priced at 300g.
---
Effectively, this mob has dropped The Magicman's Didgeridoo for the mage and it has dropped The Pokey Shanker for the rogue. The only difference is that the rogue has to go through an extra step. There is no reason that this should be exclusively given to the mage, especially when he can just not equip it, sell it on the AH, and do what the rogue was going to do anyways.
---
Come on man, don't be a scab.
---
Agreed, that would be funny as hell.
---
&gt; No, it's because being a good dps takes two brain cells rubbing together
---
You've never seen a good dps if you think that.
---
r and o are on the same line and l is hit twice. They are literally the exact same to type. /roll theres no need to type 100. Honestly if you cant type roll, roll 100 or rnd pretty quick you should practice typing skills.
---
How did you manage that because im averaging 4-5 hours 50-56 on my priest per lvl and its getting slower. 2 hrs really?
---
Not to mention until &lt;40 all the chests are crap food, and a grey.  Maybe a few have more, but mostly that.
---
I'll be buying 5 BoE epics for my two characters that will last them until the end of Classic - to get that 2-3k gold I need a big pile of cash a lot more than a hunter needs a relatively minor weapon upgrade to help them level.
---
Seeing as you're a tank I've had this conversation a lot of times in dungeons. I'm a warlock and I like to keep corruption up on all targets, I mostly do it if there are 3 or 4 guys, otherwise I aoe if we got a mage. Is it fine to put corruption on the targets which aren't being focused down? In some runs I don't pull aggro, but most of the time I do.
---
LOL amazing joke buddy

Your younger self was more mature
---
Depends on your class and leveling style. Easier classes following a guide and speed leveling? 4-5 days /played. Easier classes just questing and taking it easy? 5-6 days /played. Slower classes taking their time? 7-8 days /played. 
---
I would say your average quester just enjoying the ride is probably somewhere between 7-8 days /played.
---
I say "ye" and "yis" to mean yes. I guess it *is* short for "yeet" but not used like "yeet".
---
The weird thing is that mages are great to have in groups because of their CC, food/water, and high ranged dps. Yet now there's this whole other reason for their to be a "mage meta." It's a pity, in way, since the class is very good and complete without that.
---
Greed on Rares need on epics, thems the rules since the dawn of time. Breaking them is ninja, thems the rules
---
To any Mage getting upset at undercutting: Someone else needs a port every 10 seconds. When that guy grabs someone and ports, the price goes back up to whatever someone is willing to pay and whatever you are willing to accept. Quit being a bitch about someone offering cheap or free ports.
---
To anyone complaining about some Mages charging a gold: Most of them are doing it for profit. Doing it for less than that isn't worth the time for the most part. They would be better off farming cloth or herbs somewhere for better gold earnings if the ports only get them 10-20s profit like non-Mages seem to want. Luckily, most people tip/offer 1-2 gold per port and it's not a problem, but there's some vocal whiners on both sides.
---
You can disable all the other modules though. But if you are in a dungeon or raiding, damage taken is a very good stat to know.
---
I've played both sides to higher levels. My observations are that Horde are much more likely to group up and kill, while 1 on 1 the Alliance are more likely to camp, but probably out of frustration.
---
As for who attacks lowbies more often, I'd say in most cases it's even, but I always got ganked so much more, way more, in Redridge than Stone talon, so Horde takes the prize for ganking lowbies.
---
As for the OP. Perhaps I could suggest moving to a PvE server? Pvp happens. Pvp problems have pvp solutions.
---
I feel you. I picked a mage for classic because I've never really played a mage, I wanted to try it out and was super excited for it, but like you said this sub had really put a damper on my excitement for it, I may have to stop visiting for a while. I do aoe kills every now and then, but only if there's no one else around, otherwise I will always single target to be fair to the other people around me, just sucks feeling like everyone thinks I'm a idiot.
---
People like that is why I play at 4am in the morning.
---
Can we make this a sticky or something ?
---
A few of them are out of date according to WoW, is this an issue at all or just a warning? 
---
Also I noticed certain add-ons seem to not work like the auction house price estimator. 
---
For other add-ons I'm not sure if they are working or not, not sure how to activate or configure them. Any tips?
---
We played two different games then, buddy.
---
And that's not okay. If somebody decides I'm a ninja because I rolled need on a 2-hander while tanking, my reputation is now irreparably tarnished? Feeding into such a practice would be terrible.
---
look on wowhead. they have macro guides for each class. would link but on mobile
---
And it gets ya hyped to get back into the action! With flying mounts, you hardly got that chance to take a break.
---
we are both melee dps
---
If one guy calls you retarded, they might be an asshole
---
If everyone you meet is calling you retarded.....
---
I started farming devilsaurs at level 53 as a rogue. If I didn't have AR up I could kill them as long as they were not Tyrant. My strategy is to kite with crippling every time my energy bar was not full, so I was only attacking it while spamming sinister strike or kidney. Throw in a couple bandages and you can do it.
---
Someone's never been to Kentucky
---
What the average or lowest level for doing Uldaman?
---
oh yeah i do miss darnassus as well
---
such a magnificent grill party
---
you get reduced exp for not doing all the damage...ever pulled a mob to the guards in southshore/tarren mill? you wont get full exp when they 2 hit it for you.
---
I mean it's all nuanced, yeah?  You pull aggro, okay cool, taunt it.  You pull aggro multiple times, I'm gonna say something about attacking skull first, not the random stuff you're hitting that I don't have as much threat on.  Continue doing it after I've asked you to stop, yeah, I'm not gonna taunt and I'm gonna tell the healer to just let your dumb ass die until you figure it out.
---
Generally speaking, its much easier for a dps to play around a bad tank as long as they're at least holding aggro.  Pulling slow/smaller pulls is manageable, an impatient dps who pulls before the tank, doesn't attack marked targets, refuses to CC, etc, are all extremely detrimental to the entire group, and can't always be covered for by a good tank.
---
If you're drinking every pull as a paladin tank you're doing it wrong. It's important to map all consecrate versions and downrank to avoid Mana issues for the mobs not being focused. The primary target should be skull marked and hit with judgement every 8-10s (depending on whether you're specced for it). If you keep to this you should have to drink every 3-4 pulls, depending on your intellect. Itemization is also somewhat important, as Intel is more important than strength for a pally tank.
---
You should have named the Characters Hodor
---
"go to pve cuz you get killed by level 60 xdddd"
---
IMAGINE making this argument lmao
---
Like I said, bugged then.
---
Quartz is a great cast bar addon
---
Prety long, if you cant aquire #1 or #2 from pre raid Bis, this is a very very good alternative !
---
I find the best way to do it is to say "can I pay you for a portal to x?"
---
No ambiguity in whether or not you're tipping and it's the least awkward/quickest way to ask.
---
Nah man, nobody thinks clean energy is a bad idea. Honestly, in good faith. They just don’t claim to know the pace at which we need to pursue it, the extent of climate change (if any), or the causes of the climate change if they think it exists.
---
No memes, no banter, the internet is a pretty reasonable place if by “reasonable” you mean “able to be reasoned”.
---
Grobb is super active for “invasions” and wpvp, it’s a great server. There’s also a lot of “we are raiding here at this time” so you get some sweet large scale fights.
---
Who said he was having a bad time?
---
You could probably heal it, if you've got the gear and you're good.  I wouldnt recommend tanking it though.  Tanks generally need to out-level the content.
---
Get people to report your name for a name change. Wear a helmet
---
Gold inflation is pretty much guaranteed this early.
---
Whats that bag addon ?
---
Lol.  Can you name a single corporation that has picked up a gun?  
---
Yeah, you folks are delusional.  You think guns and corporations are able to kill.  Guns are inanimate and corporations don’t exist.
---
I can tell you the month and year of Defias blades manufactured.
---
Spell Batching feels pretty messed up even at 40ms.  It's worse for certain classes like hunters who are very reliant on autoshot timer, FD, trap, etc.
---
No way it's short for yeet. Been around long before that.
---
It's just a laid back yes.
---
Well regardless of if it is good, it is reality. I don't do this personally but I have seen people say they will blacklist a ninja from chat alone.
---
Hammer vs hammer seems more desirable than glock vs glock though, doesn't it? I mean if it's a fight to the death anyway maybe not, but usually people aren't there to kill you, they just want your stuff. And hammers are significantly worse at accidentally killing someone, plus they're much less prone to escalating a situation because someone thought someone else made a sudden movement.
---
I learned the same way everyone else did, by greeding and having shit stolen. The commonly accepted choice is to need because everyone else unless you know them is to be considered hot garbage.
---
He's still spamming Trade "MAGE LFG"
---
Tbh i don't know much about all the bmah drops so you may be right on this one. It's still a thing but i didn't want to Gamble my gold like that
---
and ?
---
I’m gonna disagree with this one. Ya it would be faster but it’s a game and they want to play dps. I’ve leveled Warrior in the past and I’m a solid tank and even then I’d prefer to dps every once and awhile. 
---
I can’t imagine being a new tank, in a dungeon I don’t know pulls well, not knowing my rotation well, and having experienced dps/heals pushing me to pull faster.

---
so how about this instance? the hunter only thinks he needs it, in reality he will equip a downgrade and waste the gold entirely. im not passing on a chance for some extra gold only becoz the huntard doesn't understand how his class works.
---
We dont know how good that gold farming actually  is tho
---
right?
---
they are great on pservers but this is something else
---
/mourn
---
Strat Dead is metal as fuck.
---
There aren't currently any pvp to pve server transfers :/. I would have done a long time ago otherwise.
---
The default feature isn't working with the addon I have (FasterLooting).
---
The looting is too slow when autoloot pickpocketing without an addon.  Loot inevitably gets missed, so once the mob dies I have to loot it twice (normal loot, then pickpocket loot).
---
Sm Spamming. Also I made quite a bit of silk bags on ah. Also if u do armoury open the weapon creates while people are killing things. Grey weps sell for 50s plus
---
Good going mate. Getting arms talents is very good for the stance dancing. 
---
If you want to use thunderclap, consider that you probably always are in defensive stance. So you have to switch to battle and then go back to defensive.
---
You can still do 2h tanking. But that could also mean that you are 90% of the time wielding a shield and 1h and then switch to berserker stance for a whirlwind or switch to battle stance to cast a sweeping strike. 
---
I bound battle stance and berserker stance to the abilities that need them. After that swap back to defensive stance and shield. So i only use one key for changing a stance and that is for defensive stance.
---
My electricity is 100% renewable. I'm against coal and I think the owners of the data centers should do what I do.
---
Were you following me in WC?
---
Wanna buy me a token so I can keep playing classic? I was never good at making gold, max I ever had was like 15k 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Full time job, GF, trainings, etc and I'm only level 15. However I'm no lifing it after work today.
---
I mean blizzard admitted that their implementation of spellbatching is not exactly how it worked in vanilla, and that it's more of a attempt to replicate it. So it's possible that something is off with the way its currently implemented,  however the only ones who can test how correct it is... is blizzard.
---
The goal is to reach 60, but that goal isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Just sit back relax and play as you want.
---
you call all the mobs with aoe essentially at the same time. If I remember right it's faster. I prefer it this way as a healer because this fight is boring and long
---
She's immune to sting or it'd be pretty straightforward. I used to do it but I had full T1 and some T2 so now it's a little different. We'd use cheetah to keep 41 yards and just outrange the boulder usually
---
If your health is less than 1200 at 54, why are you trying to kill it with rez sickness
---
I always feel sad when I see a big group of mobs. I have to take so much care to not pull all at once because I cant kite them forever or farm them all at same time.
---
Then a mage comes by and is like "imma just take all of these thank you very much"
---
I got bitched out for "only using auto shot" in a dungeon last week.
---
Well yeah, I tried weaving in my abilities when we started but if I did more than serpent sting I had mobs running at me..not sure why the 47 druid tank was able to hold aggro better than you, a level 50 warrior, but I'd rather take it slow than piss the healer off
---
Are you utilizing the 5 second rule and front loading your casts? Not sure exactly what shamans should cast but you should essentially be pulling with lightning bolt, popping down searing totem, and then just auto attacking so that your mana starts to regen.
---
It's kind of like what the far left did to the liberal party.  Amirite? Political humor, heh.
---
Blizzard should limit/temporary block character creation on a faction when the number of average active players heavily outnumbers the other faction. Otherwise they are just killing the server and converting it into a PVE.
---
My friend has been selling sagefish delight that give the mp5 on AH for about 1g 50s per stack of 20. Somedays he just runs loops in STV looking for the sagefish groups to make gold.
---
Says the coward on the overpop faction.
---
42
---
Might I interest you in a fourth?
---
100% idk what the fuck everyone is talking about in this thread.
---
If you are PUGGING something and I don't talk to you every day I'm sure as hell not letting you get an item worth 50g+ just because you can use it. That money can go towards my character in the exact same way by using the AH. Just because it's free for someone to use at that time gives them no right to take 30-50$ in real money equivalency from me.
---
I am doing STV right now and have fishing. Where do you find the floating wreckage? Does it look like? Like a school of fish?
---
AH, that makes sense. I recently tried switching to auctionator based on the post about classic addons yesterday but I'm not sure whether I like it better or not.
---
I do like the "Sell" tab a lot. It's very efficient at undercutting all the competition. But the "Buy" tab seems extremely slow, clunky, and lacking in content in comparison to auctioneer's update to the default buying tab.
---
Worth way more than that.
---
I love this sight, alway have. Can't wait till my warrior is high enough so I can do stratholme aswell 😁
---
Can i drop tailoring after crafting my truefaith chest?
---
The need/greed is a trust based system and people who say things like "everyone should need" are doing as much if not more to undermine the system than the few and far between abusers of the system.
---
You think you do...
---
It will take much much much longer than 50 years before we start noticing anything.
---
It's not worth as much as the person who needs it as an upgrade though. If a BoP item is as good as a 500g BoE item, but vendors for 2 gold, it's got more value being picked up by someone who can and wants to use it.
---
The rage is on the other side of the screen.
---
I think you messed something up here.
---
It's accurate if you include them doing it to themselves
---
The dad in me just wants to complete the dungeon at a reasonable rate so I can slowly catch up to my friends who are all blasting through levels as soon as they get home from work while I'm here trying to make sure my kid grows up so he can power level my character in an MMO in 10 years.
---
Or running in as a paladin, dropping your first judgement on the main target and by the time conc even goes out the blizzard has started.
---
Auto-attack.
---
What is the average wait time per thousand players in queue? For example, if I login and there's a queue of over 3k players, how long should it take for me to get on? I am planning on remoting in from work before I get home.
---
Also, let's say I spend a couple hours in the queue, I get to the character screen but I get disconnect because I didn't arrive on time. How long do I have to log back in until I'm sent to the back of the queue again?
---
I dunno 50s seems pretty cheap for the time your spending on getting the group together and running the actual dungeon. 
---
I mean 4g is probably the max you could make per hour.
---
I farmed SFK for my mount money. Set hs in SS. Between looted silver, greys, AH greens I'd make about 6-8g per hour. Id hearth to empty bags and fish the 3 oily blackmouth pools at the dock, which fly off the AH for a G per stack. 
---
Also got a couple of twink blue which were a real boost. If shadowfang drops you can retire. Went from 4g to mount in a couple of days hard grind
---
They are pretty obnoxious. Mage accumulated a lot of the DPS snobs because they did a fair bit of research and knew the class was top notch. Which is fine, but the type of players who only pick the best class skews towards unpleasant elitists.
---
Nice try
---
Imp. motw is like, an extra 100 armor, 4 stats and 7 resists. Personally, furor would be the better choice if you plan to PvP at all and it helps for grinding in the open world as well.
---
Auto Attack
---
Auto-attack
---
I seem to recall it checks your fishing level when you cast. Not sure, though.
---
In any case, it's not really consequential, right?
---
Spellbatching is still in retail. It just is in significantly smaller batches compared to classic.
---
No its not lmao
---
Auto attack
---
Huh, always reversed sleep and sap.
---
Triangle is green, closer to nature skill sleep. Circle /star (yellowish is closer to rogue color).
---
Apparently always made sufficient sense in my party for me not having to explain 😀
---
They have to learn how to use their threat dumps some time.
---
[MikScrollingBattleText Classic ](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24962-MikScrollingBattleTextClassicquickfix.html#info) works wonders for me.
---
1st of all, if you're using 10 hours past 50 you're doing something wrong. With effective questing, you should be able to throw down a level every 4-5 hours. As the current meta stands, you can easily do each level in about 3 hours with AOE instance farming.
---
Vieu. I play on Stonespine.
---
Let me know when the consequences arrive. I won't be holding my breath.

Favorite has to be the kid that can make people dissapear.

---
You make a good point... Crud
---
Been farming ZF with spellcleave group all weekend, this is definitely not true on my server.
---
&gt; Either it needs to go or be removed.
---
hmmmm
---
Just want to add, what the majority frowns upon doesn’t make it necessarily bad. Majority isn’t always right.
---
Do you have to keep your fishing  rod in a certain bag slot?
---
Btw Mara bow is better DPS than that gun anyways.
---
Correct, but this doesn’t work for target heals.
---
Hm, what a sad view on life. Hoping that you're treating people like shit in the real world too.
---
That's just incorrect, though. There's piles of people (generally in states with a huge coal or oil economy) that hold the belief, sincerely and deeply, that any push for 'clean energy' is a betrayal. To their mind, their jobs are in coal, therefore, never shall clean energy be spoken of or considered. Here in Canada, Alberta views any comment about clean energy or maybe someday beginning to consider moving away from coal or oil as 'an attack' on the province. These people 100% exist.
---
Why would you post this?
---
\&gt; Why don't ya'll grow a pair and fight a fair fight for once in your lives  
---
Ganking is fun
---
I stopped giving a fuck about retail when every 3 months all of my gear would be useless. It sucks because retail is *fun* to play but it's more of a Diablo type ARPG where you are forced to group for higher content instead of classic where you genuinely want to group to interact and make things easier.
---
oh that is so sad! I love that guild name!
---
Maybe your right or maybe you are misremembering things from 12 years ago.
---
an actual funny and witty pun.  
---
quite the rarity.
---
Thanks! Last time I checked this wasn’t up for classic yet. I’ll have to give it a go after work.
---
I play on horde side and really like it. High population, areas all seem busy but never any queues.
---
Yes, you'll still be able to use it!
---
The runs would typically take me half an hour without a healer in the group and 20 mins with one. So you're looking at more like 4g per 45mins as finding a group of customers is the longest part.
---
Pretty terrible sense of humor.
---
Yes. It does not require tailoring to equip, just to make it.
---
Well I mean compared to mages and rogues, hunters' DPS really is quite low. On lower lvls you can't really see it but I'm lvl 38 and I can already see the gap becoming wider and wider. Mages and rogues top all the DPS meters whilst rest of the classes stay waaaay back.
---
First honest fucking answer in the entire thread. Thanks.
---
Incorrect. If healers are pulling aggro, you blame the tank. This circlejerk is just sad. Tank disparity exists, has always existed and will continue to exist. Some are great, most are average, some are just plain awful.
---
This guy is marching to “I am an dwarf and I’m digging a hole, diggy diggy hole, digging a hole”
---
My group always needs. Can’t ninja if everyone needs on it. If someone wants it for an upgrade we just sell at a discount then. So someone wins gold, and someone gets an upgrade cheaper than AH. We’ve been pretty happy with it so far, we always tell our randoms the rules too.  Idk why people think everyone should pass up on a large pile of gold because someone can use it, the gold is easily more important at lower levels than an upgrade for 3-5 levels.
---
Thunderclap does reduce the damage you take, also reduces the rage you can generate and costs 20 rage for marginal threat

The guy with the camera should be healers. They're just sitting back enjoying the show, getting invited to the spell cleave groups and tagging along.
---
absolutely, it's your No.1 pvp skill
---
instant, good damage, fear, lifesteal - nothing more you could want from a spell
---
Especially with how little damage the mobs do. If your opening revenge doesn't hit then you're sitting there with one sunder on the target and a long time until you get enough rage for the next one.
---
How is Warlock compared to Mage?
---
In terms of DPS, utility kit, farming potential, leveling, PvP, Raiding, Dgs, etc...
---
As many aspects that you can tell me..
---
Yeah, it’s been broken for about half a week or so now. I used to run it myself to help contribute and get more concise numbers. Still don’t think there’s that many servers that are alliance dominated, especially pre addon block. Currently I’d say there’s probably 6 or so alliance dominated, and that’s mostly just because of the low pop servers.
---
What's the name of the addon which shows a bar at the top with various stats such as xp/hr, free bag space, gold, etc?
---
Yep 2g + grey drops is too low for the time invested.
---
fuck yeah nirvana
---
&gt; Ultimately though, what killed it for me though was the drinking. 
---
The paladins that drink most don't downrank, and that's as big a mistake as being unable to stance dance as a warrior.
---
can confirm, happened to me plenty of times already.
---
&gt; The western world countries are some of the most culturally influential countries. If we set the standard high others are sure to follow.
---
Really? Please tell me how we are supposed to make China and India follow us? 
---
China has been progressively buying and investing into western companies. Chinese billionaires and Middle Eastern royalty own more real estate in big western cities than you can probably imagine. Heck, China alone has 600 million more citizens than the entire US, Canada and EU together.
---
Heck, look at the company who makes the game this subreddit is about. Look at Facebook. They bend over backwards to accomondate China.
---
But, yes, quite obviously China is going to give in now that Greta did an emotional speech in front of the UN and we are using mean words.
---
Man this brings back memories! We had a lan party once and my friend went to get some food or something. We macro'd his judgement spell to XT from Ulduar saying, "I guess it doesn't bend that way!" He was a heavy button spammer, so you would hear, "I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I guess it doesn't bend that way!" over and over and over.
---
How would he have aggro if all his attacks miss and dps are blowing their but all over the mobs and pulling off of him? Pretty sure that's what he means when he says he tries to taunt.
---
Honestly I find this so fucking irritating.  Every time I glance at LFG when I start to look for a run as a tank I constantly see "LF MAGE FOR {dungeon} AOE MULTI CLEARS" and shit like this.  I tank these runs unknowingly all the time and it honestly is so frustrating.
---
I try to get threat on everything but one blizzard and I'm now chasing around mobs as they pull to the mage(s) and I can't get rage to do any other threat generating abilities, healer goes OOM every pull.  I just don't find it fun.  Why am I here when apparently you mages are just as good at tanking (or apparently better at keeping threat, anyway) as I am?
---
Just so annoying.  Much like you I also fear this is just how it's going to be for Classic so when I find people from groups that don't feel the need to run like this I just make sure to add them and run with them later.
---
I mean if your right then that's good because it means getting wrongly called a ninja isn't as bad as you would think.
---
There is one chain in ASzhara where you pick up 4 tables, then bring those tables to ppl in orgri, uc and tb and return back...each turn in gives money and xp and each coming back does as well, quite a lot of xp for a little world traveling.
---
This isn't exclusive to Classic you dense fart.
---
The worst part when my non tanking pet has to tank the mob that is going for the healer or spell caster and I bring the mob to the tank so he can take aggro but noooo he just continues on that 1 mob that he has a hard on for.
---
Ye is my preferred way of agreeing to something reluctantly
---
We've devolved.
---
Sounds fine up to ZG. Might work in ST. But awful for BRD.
---
People who play like this don't last long late game. You knew about who the dicks on your server were in vanilla. Curious to see how far it goes now with social media. 
---
Sucks it happened to you, but best to move on for now. Blacklist his name if you remember it.
---
His story is compelling and one you can totally relate to. One reason his story arc and character resonate with so many IMHO.
---
How do you know he’s not trying to let the horde in? #treasongate
---
Not sure why you're making so many assumptions about me. I know it's not a perfect system, but it's fair and can't be abused, and to me that's better than trusting four strangers when hundreds of gold is on the line.
---

On the contrary, I’m exceptionally nice to people as that’s how I’d like to be treated. Though that’s stops when they prove themselves to be a shitty person. Though I still always assume the worst of people as it’s usually true.
---
Me, personaly ? I just use cover and blast the pet or use trinket / engineer helmet or consumables to make up the distance if i feel like the hunter won't mess up and  really keep the 37-41yards range at all time.
---
That's how I remember it from Vanilla. You need it to upgrade your gear, you greed if you just want to sell it.
---
The key is to run with mages and locks.  Then you all drink together after blitzing down every pull.
---
Maybe pause questing for a bit and do some dungeons?
---

Ran mara maybe over 20 times for this to drop on my warrior, man its BRUTAL.
---
If i learned something in my life:  
---
If you fight someone who has a knife. You. Will. Get. Cut.  
---
No matter how skilled you are in any martial art. You. Will. Get. Cut.
---
However if you accept that you will be able to assess the risk and find a way to defend yourself and maybe even win.
---
Fighting someone with a Gun:  
---
You're fucked. If they keep a little bit of a distance there is no way you can disarm them or run away. Life is not the matrix where you can dodge bullets when you hear the BANG. If they're close you have to be a trained individual to stand a chance at disarming. And even then it's super dangerous.
---
All in all the best defense in a fight is to run. Only if you can not run you should fight.
---
How do you multibox on one account?
---
Well you gotta buy it from your trainer.
---
But yes, you don't need to level it.
---
Is it visible to other players?
---
I would wait until you have your mount.
---
Definitely first aid! Fishing and cooking not so much, you can easily level those up after you get your mount as their not super important for leveling (especially as you're a mage so you can make your own food!). However first aid is great to have in dungeons as a self heal, and also will make leveling faster.
---
To offset the cost, it's likely you'll get a grey weapon drop when you're running SM cathedral in your late 30's that will vendor for over a gold, so don't worry about the cost. When you're nearing 40, a single gold is a very small amount.
---
fucking multishot dude every time
---
Take healthstones from warlocks, buffs from druids, low repair costs from tanks holding aggro, food from mages and resurrections from priests, then complain when the group wants to roll on the locked chest because they don’t value the unique skill you bring to the dungeon.
---
I ran SM Gy on my rogue. While I was waiting for the party I went in and cleared one if the chests. No one has to know..
---
That's true, the way I see it I'm getting an epic mount faster which will allow me to farm gold faster. "Time is money, friends!"
---
Sulfuras server?
---
Ventrilo is missing.
---
Healing is definitely autopilot 80% of the time, but that 20% when it all goes to shit is so damn fun.
---
REDDIT COMMENT
---
i can use the item
---
Farm the Hippogryphs in Azshara for hours. It's a 0.001% drop chance. /S It's a visual bug from the FP.
---
I just stayed my opinion, you're the one who turned it into a "onversation".
---
Imagine getting to 40 and having to buy all of the mounts at once.
---
Based off his gear I'd say he's been to busy bother with names. Lol
---
Tbh I think this topic does indeed have much to do with the phases. Surely in Phase 6, when the pvp brackets have formed, people will always agree to Need on BoEs, simply because people will be aware of the value and people are actually buying it. 
---
Right now, there is no established pvp bracket. BGs aren't even out yet. Casuals will use stuff that helps them level faster. People need a general guideline to follow, Needing BoEs should be something that people need to agree on, to make sure everyone's happy and nobody gets shamed.
---
Literally playing mage in classic because it was impossible to get water from mages in beta.

What mod did that for your quest log? I need that in my life.

How the hell do I heal high level dungeons as a shaman?  I'm 55 and just did my first BRD last night, and it went fucking terribly due to me. I'm using the typical 30/0/21 (my last 5 points are in the resto tree) Everything I've read made it seem like if I have healing/int gear (which I do in every slot) that this would be possible, but I was having a horrible time keeping the tank alive, and he was lvl 60.  Everything would go well, but as soon as he would take damage spikes my big heals would be too slow, or I would have to spam lhw relentlessly and I would oom instantly.
---
I don't mind going deep resto if/when I ever move into raid content, but I really don't want to have to do that to heal the pre raid dungeons, and be stuck spamming LFG unable to do any solo questing or grinding. (hello epic mount?) Any advice would be appreciated, everything I seem to find online revolves around raid healing, and boils down to 'just spam chain heal and keep windfury totem down duh'
---
how about killing dalaran mages then in wrath being like ayeee we cool right? let us in Dalaran plz
---
I wanna kill mobs faster though. If I intend to just auto them all down I could've stayed enh.
---
Objectively you should save it. However, if you really enjoy skilling these secondary professions, go for it.
---
You can pay a little bit of attention to which ability is the most mana/damage efficient, but for actual rotation there isn't really one. Probably immolate/corruption/curse of agony on bigger monsters, smaller mobs can just take corruption and CoA or maybe even just corruption since it takes a bit for CoA to start ticking harder. Wanding is going to be your primary ability.
---
It’s tough as 51 bro. I’d just grind a few levels by questing till you hit 54-55
---
Hey Ollivander
---
We absolutely require consumables for our raids. For example, going into MC as a Priest I'm required to bring Greater Fire Protection Potions, Greater Arcane Protection Potions, Major Mana Potions, Demonic/Dark Runes, and Nightfin Soup. We're still working on getting the flask recipes, but those will eventually become mandatory as well when we're working on progression content.
---
I tend to be on the side of the tank, back in the day you waited 5-10 seconds before DPS on a pull. These days most tanks have to 2h just to dream about keeping aggro against rogues/fwarriors/mages because everyone is a meter queen.
---
Did you read my post? Permas are only handed out after repeat offenses, there's only been one ban wave for layering so of course there were no Permas
---
MY-MY-MY MUSIC MAKES ME   SO HARD
---
Yea that addon changes all the UI - mail, profession... I personally find it more annoying than helpful.
---
Who?
---
It does not affect the catch rate of seasonal fish. The drop rate does however vary with the time of day with peaks at noon server time. In bay of storms right at noon I was seeing a 40% catch rate on squid equaling the lobster catches but it quickly leveled out to 20% by the early afternoon.
---
Cheers for this man!
---
I guess I just didn't realize it until I was 25 or so. Never really caught it. Now it's just annoying. Some manga are okay though.
---
Bro this post is embarrassing the horde
---
i mean, he just highlighted how and why streaming works..
---
I definitely feel like I missed out on Legion. I had a friend jump into it when it was current and from what I heard and saw it seems like I would like it. However I didn't jump on current back then and since then a LOT of opinions I've heard about BfA are overwhelmingly negative, and some of it things in it seem like things I wouldn't like anyways coming from other games.
---
Seen people trying to sell it for up to 700g.
---
You need to find a very rich player to be able to sell it at even close to that price considering that's BASICALLY an epic mount and no one of right mind would prioritise a weapon over an epic mount.
---
Imo, the value drops precipitously when Dire Maul is released. The difference between the Unyielding Maul from tribute and the staff is tiny.
---
I don't. He's just a dude living the dream. Getting paid to play classic wow and enjoying life.
---
Classic world first, not vanilla
---
I’ve played a mage since 2004. This mage meta is really pissing me off. I’ve never charged anyone for food or water. Hell, I don’t even recall ever consistently charging for ports (not 40 yet, so haven’t experienced in classic). I will use AoE to my advantage when questing, but I’m not gonna ask for giant pulls in dungeons if everyone isn’t ok with it. 
---
People doing these things are why we now have the rep of vanilla hunters.
---
shouldn't that mean not posting this to reddit? isn't that the point of patreon?
---
I was gonna downvote after seeing that baby's face, but the prisoner turning around really got me, and I'm glad I stuck around.
---
Are you downranking your heals?
---
As for raid healing, rank 1 chain heal mainly. (Literally)
---
I like your idea,  and get where you are coming from but I don't think it's fair.  What if your problem isn't the imbalance of factions but server wait times?    
---
I'm on skeram right now too and my friends and I are considering a transfer mostly because some of them can't log on until 8pm. That often means 2k+ wait times. Why should I be punished and forced to stay on a server because the faction I chose is underrepresented?
---
I was a shaman tank in SFK last night.  The group actually liked it.
---
As another guy said...down ranking helps.
---
Every rogue just has pickpocketing, you can't max the skill because it's always max based on your level.
---
LoS pulls and standing at max range are skills that have largely atrophied in WoW players, but I think they'll start to make a comeback as general knowledge in classic eventually.
---
I was already pleasantly surprised how willing people were to use CC even in lower-level dungeons.
---
You’ll be surprised how many people actually have a lot of gold at this point.  BIS Purps are selling for thousands across a lot of servers.
---
Very sage advice, thanks for the input!
---
This is my intention anyway.
---
I would think toward the end of phase 1. When DM opens there is mace that is pretty close to the staff.
---
I don't care. Their propensity for level 60 babysitting must be addressed.
---
100% serious.  Theres some minor stuff.  But for the most part, the game plays a lot like it did in the past. Class changing is not the same as game changing.
---
Runescape 3 on the other hand, introduces action skills and an action bar.  A major shift in gameplay from what the players were used to.
---
But you wont ? you are going to trade it ?
---
For me it was the music when you enter stormwind. It brings back a rush of emotions and memories from the returning victory of friends going to sell items and work on professions right back to the feelings of seeing Arthas return to lordaeron and betray the kingdom in WC3. It is so intense and epic, gets my paladin ass every time.
---
He isn't covering his costs.  You are not including the opportunity cost of using magic essences which could otherwise be sold on the auction house.
---
I noticed this too, was grinding out some kill x quests in a random group and greens were raining down.
---
If he mailed you just get his name from the mail or go through mail recovery if it's deleted.
---
Nothing like watching a greater heal go off, losing the mana,  and running back explaining to the group why the tank died
---
Only took a warrior to 31 but I think some of it is that the meta has changed and people dps/pull so quickly that it is hard to build rage.
---
That said, are you charging with 2 hander, swinging, sweeping strike and the going sword and board? I imagine as you level up and get better gear it will probably get easier.
---
What is "G"
---
There's zero point discussing balance unless blizzard decides to make classic into a rolling restart "season" type game like private servers did.
---
At this point that seems unlikely. Community support is vastly more in favour of progressing to TBC and/or WotLK (blizzard has said this would be easy to do) or Classic+ which does include balance changes, but only after all content roll out.
---
Because we're moving on to further content/itemization about as fast as they could possibly tune the game with reasonable caution there's no real point talking about current content.
---
Yeah it was only a few weeks tho, DM was a few months and had catch up gear.
---
Why not? It's worth the same to everybody, everybody should profit, not one person. That's not fair, right?
---
You just want your cake and eat it too.
---
Answer? No. :(

that addon sucks.

it randomly breaks and loses track of your quest.
---
TLDR: Hunter DIDN'T get the loot.
---
My god you nailed it on the head I think for a lot of us.  Those who might be going through a shitty part of our lives, perhaps a troublesome boss that wrecks hell upon us day after day, or we just experienced a tragedy that only time is going to relieve.  Finding an escape that doesn't cause us bodily harm can be a savior to our minds.  I know personally until I get through this particularly harsh part of my life with a particularly bad boss, WoW Classic has been an absolute saint to me.  It's helped me cope, and this is after a long 9 year hiatus from the game, having had no desire to return to the game ever again.  It has been a pleasure.
---
What are the little icons above their heads?
---
No not at all.  
---
Examples please ?
---
Bruh this is the literal worst
---
Doesn't work, hence the question
---
No...no I don't think that's the point. This circlejerk apparently goes deeper than we knew.
---
Classic = better world
---
Retail = better combat 
---
It is kinda refreshing going back to retail actual rotations  after casting 10000 frostbolts in a row. Biggest problem with retail is the lag of content.
---
I'm also in 2560x1440p, 144hz, and 150% resolution scale, yet my game doesn't look this good.

I couldn’t agree more, i now avoid inviting orc warriors cause i’ve had so many bad experiences...

Sap breaks stealth?? Did this change in BC or beyond?
---
As long as you want. There's no rush to 60, no rush to get your ilevel up for the next dungeon, no dailies. Just login, play, get immersed and then log off.
---
Yep, had a similar situation with Scarlet Chestpiece, my warrior friend got upset that we all needed on it.
---
I had to explain to him "bro, you are level 40 you should be wearing plate" but he was whining nonstop that it was better than his current chest piece (which was some level 30 mail).
---
Since I won the roll, I sold the chestpiece for 10g and bought him a superior plate chest off the AH for 1g. He was blown away "wow you really got that for only 1g?" Then came the realization he didn't know there is a different between Bind on Equip and Bind on Pickup.
---
BOE is for selling.
---
BOP is for actual gearing.
---
&gt;PvP takes practice
---
yeah pretty sure spellbatching is not supposed to work on skinning stuff also
---
If they were approached reasonably, and with a reasonable plan, they’d be fine man. The issue is that we don’t approach the topic reasonably. We send out celebrities and their ego or make awkward attempts at manipulation with children. Send out the scientists and talk to the world plainly motherfather. You have to take ego out of the discussion BECAUSE ITS SCIENCE. Everyone I see talk about climate change discusses it like they are the ones who discovered it and they want to take credit as humanity’s savior.
---
But,  why?
---
Defiantly foreign
---
you should only be dotting the main target if you dot everything you are just aoeing.
---
That sound good i will try it, but im looking for something to keep a hold on the target while im fighting another target in pvp
---
It's easy to do, especially since some (Undermine Clam Chowder from Tanaris is the first one that comes to mind) are limited quantities and the vendor only stocks 1 or 2 at a time.
---
DM is phase 2? Still no announcement on phase release timing, right?
---
&gt;There are plenty of circumstances where the items will be returned, by Blizzard’s intervention
---
Sure! This is not one of them.
---
Haha, same here xD
---
&gt; I need it for my epic mount money.

If only there was a term for that, like greed or something.

Perfect summary of the wankery going on in this sub at the moment.
---
I know Whitemane and Faerlina are almost always full during peak hours. My main is on Bigglesworth and I dont have issues getting in since the first week.
---
Some A grade cringe right here
---
Yeah, the definitely have the tools. It's not a matter of finding the right person. Any of the GMs can do it. They just wont because it's against their policy.  As you said they would be responding to those tickets all day!
---
I think they’d just get rid of them 
---
The trolls lost their weed reference too doe idk when that happened 
---
Doe they have a lot of leeway bc fantasy rpg and stuff
---
So you don't find AoE more fun than burning mobs one by one?
---
So I got [Recipe: Transmute Undeath to Water] off of some random mob. I hear it can sell for a ton on the AH? I'm also alchemy so I'm not sure if I should sell it or learn it. Any advice would be appreciated.
---
Just don't be an asshole and you will be fine. Don't let anyone tell you what class to play, play what you want. It's your sub money and besides most of these meta levelers will leave eventually when the next new game comes out, or when they burn out from rushing everything.
---
hahahah I can hear it so clearly! Or the annoying cackling / sneering when you target a mob that can't be feared. HYEH HEH HEH
---
that was very good
---
Oh nice. I guess I'll get that sorted tonight :D thanks for the info!
---
If this is something that was provided to his patreon backers, it's kind of not cool to post it here.
---
Well hordes in skeram were being really a*holes in game and in reddit. We made a thread about xfering from alliance and got responses like:
---
Ally scum, or your future is a tauren hoof in your face. After that we just decided to xfer.
---
Skeram dug their own grave.
---
Eye of the Beholder here. The Monsters are Due on Maple Street is a close second.
---
I’m not sure how it could possibly be slower unless you mean make early game exp much slower because after 40, it’s all a crawl.
---
&gt; If I remember correctly, the drop rate is SO low that you’ll end up grinding for over an hour anyway!
---
RNG was shitty on you. Got all the dusts in what, 15min?
---
I'm picking up what you're putting down. Calling certain raids so easy might make someone feel dumb if they're struggling in one, or if it's their first time though. I mean, it's all relative though. I don't want to say things that could deter people from doing something they might find rewarding and fuuuuun.
---
I did the exact same 2 days ago!
---
I would have to look but I'm like 5 I think
---
Huh, almost
---
I think the rediculous report feature has put a stop to anything like that. If you make one too many risque jokes the tattle tails are gonna sick daddy blizzard on you these days.
---
Don't forget about us Paladin DPS... We can rez, off heal, bubble healers in a pinch and lay on hands the tank when things get really sticky. The DPS isn't bad enough to gimp the group either unless we've really been slacking on the weapon upgrades.
---
Besides the whole needing thing, As a priest i always try my best to stay as high in mana as i can. That way, when someone pulls the inevitable patrol just after a runner goes and pulls another pack, i get my moment to shine and save the day. If that means your dpsing at a controlled 50% health, then so be it.
---
It seems to be fairly common on horde fairbanks.
---
A pug will be looking for more members but announce, either beforehand, or after you join that certain very desirable items are "reserved" I.E. if they drop, they are going to the party leader or their friend.
---
It's a dumb trend that needs to stop before it ruins pugging. If you want personal loot, go play retail.
---
Some people prefer finding their gear themselves and see more in loot than just dollar signs. Maybe some people think buying all their gear from the auction house is lame and anticlimactic.
---
Yeah no those two are purposefully inflammatory and not “advice”.
---
Are pets locked to only one character? So lets say i tamed broken tooth put him in a stable, delete my character and make a new one can i use broken tooth on that character?
---
Where I draw the line is this: If you can only get the item from farming this one place (i.e. a BoP drop from a boss in a dungeon) then only need it if you need it. If you can go on your own time and farm gold and buy it from the auction house then it's fair game.
---
Just because I have more gold than you doesn't mean you deserve it more than I do. All that means is that I've put more time/effort into the game so far.
---
I can't imagine asking a level 18 for 50 silver. When I was level 18, that was about half of my combined wealth. More than half, if I had recently purchased spells.
---
Friend from elsewhere. He even only novas when actually appropriate and counterspells proactively. Imagine!
---
Nobles fucked us over for a lot of gold so we are going to kill everyone.
---
Yeah not buying it.
---
No. I don’t want corporations to step on normal people like tyrants and you said something incredibly dumb.
---
Feral druid feels like discount rouge imo
---
Taunt
---
&lt;RESIST&gt;
---
Switch to Battle Stance 
---
Try to Mocking Blow
---
Oops the mob is now out of melee range
---
Run after it
---
Mocking Blow
---
Oops now some other DPS has pulled threat on one of the other mobs
---
Tab Sunder/Revenge
---
Now someone has pulled the skull mob again because Mocking Blow doesn't put you at top threat
---
Cry because you're having to herd cats AND dogs at the same time
---
A tank is essentially the quarterback of the raid.  They more or less control the pace of the run.  Its not that they want everything their way its that if we miss sunders, are resisted or our revenge misses and DPS went balls to the wall as soon as we pull then don't be surprised when the rogue or shamen is tanking for awhile.  
---
If things dont go the warrior's way then the clothies get agro and then we wipe.  Thats why things need to go to warriors way, if it goes our way it goes EVERYONE'S way.
---
Taunt doesn't ignore the agro situation, it places you on the top of the threat table. You could have 0 threat on a mob but taunt and sunder once and you'll be firmly at the top of the threat list unless someone can get a certain total percentage more threat than you (the threshold is different for melee and range). If you had to build threat from 0 even with taunt there would be no saving the balls deep dps who didn't attack 💀
---
Everyone should agree how the group is rolling when a BoE drops. If someone needs to use the item, they should be forced to equip it or they get kicked.
---
It's always best to discuss loot before the run. I'm of the camp that all BOEs should be Needed by everyone in the group and let RNG sort it. I understand you may need its stats now, but I need its gold. Unless I plan on twinking for BGs, I can't think of a single BoE item that drops while leveling that I'd pass up the gold for. But again, discuss it with your group so everyone is on the same page.
---
Aesthetic as fucc, hab karma.
---
I am not exactly sure, but if i have to quess, he could be someone who like to participate in something called the Battle of the Nations. It is basically a tournament where people dress up as knights and group up in team to bash other teams of knights. 
---
It is pretty funny and stupid at the same time ;[https://youtu.be/na\_gWaByvVE?t=240](https://youtu.be/na_gWaByvVE?t=240). Maybe he lived in your region.
---
As a healer, me too
---
Is that an addon?
---
No, but try using this macro to toggle autoloot.
---
    /run local k="autoLootDefault"local v,p=1-GetCVar(k),"AutoLoot "SetCVar(k,v)print(1==v and p.."Enabled" or p.."Disabled")
---
10 minute cooldown, and 6 seconds is usually tight to get a big pack under control if DPS got themselves into that situation in the first place.
---
Spamming battle shout doesn't do enough to compete with a mage blizz-ing or a rogue going in on a mob you haven't even sundered.
---
Lots of gray but he was responsible for the deaths of many innocents
---
You tag a mob they kill it out of group. Profit
---
I'm pretty sure that all of this stuff (raids cleared in a week, etc) wouldn't have been possible this quickly without the layering exploits, makes it a hell of a lot easier to farm stuff.
---
Lower ranks would also have shorter cast times (most of the time), haven't played shaman in a while so might not be 100% correct, but check the spell book when you are back in game.
---
If other people have taken damage, chain heal is fine, otherwise spam healing wave at a lower rank than max, with a decent cast time to keep them alive.
---
I keep 4 ranks of healing touch (druid heal) on my bar, with varying levels of healing, as well as cast time for this very reason.
---
I have the exact same behavior today and 15 years ago. I was funny now I'm too graphic.
---
i rolled need almost immediately, and the rest of the group acknowledged it was a great drop for me and said gz. I dont understand how people dont get Need &gt; Greed and Need = gear you can equip and is an upgrade. Need doesnt mean "i want it to sell on AH"
---
Being paranoid that somebody might need to sell it is how this bullshit starts, if you see a leather wearer roll need on a really nice leather item, would you immediately think his is ninja looting to put it on AH, or that he actually might need the gear?
---
If the general consensus is the former, then i think we are all fucked.
---
You could add a modifiers, say if you press SHIFT you say another thing directed to casters, or press ALT and say something specifically towards Rogues.
---
But I dont think macro can identify target class and say the corresponding quotes like you want.
---
I am also on Kromcrush and I got it one day at lunch two weeks ago. Nobody else was farming it at this time! Good luck!
---
There's always a way
---
I didn't know how much I missed Orgrimmar until seeing this post.

You know that nuclear power is CO2 neutral, right?
---
And just look at energy produced in germany. The amount percentage wise has increased massively in the last decades.
---
Sure, can you link me some reputable sources that show with scientific data, that Germany is heading towards a recession. From my experience, we're doing quite well economically speaking.
---
Of course she is scaring people. That is the point of it. Climate Change and environmental destruction are a world wide problem and need to be tackled on many different fronts.
---
Of course meat consumption is an issue. Meat production requires a massive amount of land (both industrialized and grass fed) to produce calories. Plants have a much smaller impact since they produce way more calories per acre. Not to mention the CH4 which is produced by ruminants and is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2.

I was referencing a multitude of your replies when I called you obnoxious. And what do you mean when you say that his fans felt he needed defending? You were asking questions why is he liked and people replied with honest answers. That's far from feeling the need to defend someone. That's called answering your question.
---
Lmao. As a programmer I agree with them. It's easy to restore a account because it's on file, but changing your event in a singular quest out of hundreds you've done. Is a down right stupid request.

You actually have a ton of free choices to play around with,  if you arent going to be progression raiding then you only really need the 13 points in Disc for the mana regen the 25 points in holy for the spirit-&gt; to spell power conversion which means that you have enough points to pick up mind flay from shadow or go much harder in the holy tree
---
From a tank: Dont do this.
---
Envious.
---
*cries in rogue*
---
I have to do this, what do you use as a surface for your mouse? A plank?
---
I start out every dungeon with pet taunt off - if the group is good then it stays off - but when the healer starts pulling mobs off the tank because he is only hitting one target or if the mage decides to AoE before the tank has aggro then I start offtanking with my pet.    
---
It works well so far - gives the tank one or more targets to not have to worry about - so far I haven't received hate for it despite my communication about it being lacking at times - most of the time they just ignore the mob that my pet is attacking and everything is fine.
---
Better idea is to get a friend to roll the opposite faction. You both just do this and make each other’s faction miserable lol
---
./whistle is different from classic to retail
---
That's an awesome background, even for it's time.
---
You missed the great oppurtunity od Senpailadin
---
I get the joke but there is a difference between giving water to team members and having randoms ask for it or even ask for a port which will cost you to make it. All depends on my mood if I will respond to some random asking.
---
Just ignore them idiots and do what you like.
---
Typical rotation is pull with either body or range, blood rage, battle shout when in melee range, sunder main target 2-3 times (sunder can stack up to 5 but usually a mob is dead before it gets that far), then rotate to the other mobs with sunder to hold threat while DPS focus down main target. If tank isn't marking attack order then you just have to pay attention to who he's attacking and follow suit (or get a threat meter addon and only target mobs you won't pull threat from). 
---
The issues come in when AoE/DoT's get put on the second/third/etc. mobs that aren't sufficiently aggro'd to the tank and get pulled to DPS/healer. Rage management is critical and highly based on timing, which is why it's better for DPS to start with single target damage while tank builds threat on the other mobs before AoE'ing. 
---
If DPS are concerned with pulling aggro, then the best anyone can do is slow down and let the tank build threat. If someone is forcing a speed clear by pulling big packs without understanding how rage/threat works then it's likely going to be a bad time for everyone. If a tank is only comfortable pulling 1-2 mobs at a time, you just have to be comfortable either going slower or risking pulling a mob and wiping.
---
15+? i haven't seen it higher than 8g on my realm lol
---
What the hell is “the meta” that’s being mentioned everywhere?
---
Putting on Whitemane's Chapeau was the moment I felt like I was truly a Classic WoW Mage
---
There being only male and female options for characters. 
---
Certain armor pieces being more "revealing" for female characters. 
---
Men being masculine.
---
Women being feminine.
---
The first aid is definitely worth it. I've also read recently that fishing can be very lucrative if you know where to fish. 
---
1g won't be hard to get once you get into the late 30s. I have four 12 slot bags and at this point I get like 10-15g every time I fill them up while questing.
---
10% is pretty generous.
---
I have a very nice cloth lined couch. I use the armrest. It works perfectly.
---
Not gonna lie feel like this story is 100% fabricated lol
---
You look like you're about to Kamehameha his other tooth off
---
Jesus you have a hard on for this guy. How many hours per week do you watch him?
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Honestly, every single person at level 60 right now exploited layering and the raid exp bug. But keep on believing....
---
My name Pullmytotem got force changed for being insensitive. Come on, people.
---
I mean the 5 instance is in place for a reason...
---
Details damage meter shows percentage of damage from each skill. Not sure if it shows windfury, though.
---
I am a fellow Ally on Skeram.  I agree that server xfers should be gated to be faction specific.  There has been a mass exodus of Alliance in the past couple days which is only worsening the problem for those of us who remain.
---
I also saw another post about implementing faction specific queues which I think would be a nice feature.  For example, the most populous faction could be capped at 1.5x the less populous faction.  This would guarantee that the ratio of active players would never be WORSE than 60-40... which is still not great but beats the hell out of being outnumbered more than 2-1 which we are right now.
---
More than anything I would like to get some feedback from Blizzard on what they will/will not do to address the issue.  If they aren't gonna do anything then I may end up jumping ship as well.  It just feels awful competing for open world resources when every encounter is stacked against you so greatly.  I have been trying to farm demonic runes for my robe of the void for a week now but every single satyr encampment in Azshara and Felwood constantly have an enormous Horde presence.  I won't have enough till December at this rate...
---
Lol, I remember getting a 3 day ban for telling risqué/sterotype jokes in chat like 12 years ago when I was bored one night.  There’s always been some uptight little bitch just waiting to “do their part” with the report button.
---
So from reading this exchange... I am close to 100% certain that this guy thinks his character name is "Panther" and is wholly unaware that he spelled it wrong.
---
Yes? Someone who campaigns for and speaks about something they value? What are you even trying to say?
---
and my farts are not old, but funky fresh.
---
 *What are the fundamental issues with wow classic that make it grindier and less newb friendly than retail? The world is huge and it takes a long time to get anywhere, you're constantly low on money because you need to buy food/bandages etc* 
---
if you lvl up bandage and cooking while lvling it's not a issue Oo, I do it with all my char even with the mage.., but you're right it's a fast leveler, then, because of the AOE grinding, mage start to have a bad reputation.
---
5 minutes~
---
Never saw a Grenade tossed at me and I’m lvl 60 for over 1.5 weeks now. Maybe they are too expensive for rnd world pvp rn?
---
Makes sense. I try not to fd unless I have multiple mobs on me.
---
I usually group with my friend who plays priest and I tell him to ignore my HP when I have 1 mob on me
---
Yes and no.
---
It's definitely the DPS's job to attack the tank's target and watch their threat.  Back in the day, it was 100% common-place to simply click the tank and then attack their target.  Plus, you had threatmeters running, so you'd know how not to pull aggro.
---
But I've seen all kinds of stupid shit in dungeons now.  DPS will literally just attack anything/everything they see.  Very little CC, almost zero focus fire.  Stupid players will spam AoE within 1-2 seconds of the pull, and get aggro from more mobs than the tank can taunt, etc etc.
---
DPS have to learn to get better.   "You pull it, you tank it" is a very extreme way to teach that lesson, but sometimes if the DPS is super-stupid, maybe that's the only thing they'll understand.
---
Nah, I'm using it, perhaps you found the wrong version.
---
I'll post a link this evening when I get home.
---
While leveling, you can’t even blame a tank.  No one specs pure tanking unless you’re purely doing instances with friends... cause f that. Questing is a mofo as a Druid in tank spec
---
It certainly feels that way
---
My baseline for a good tank is that I can put agony + corruption on all of the mobs and shadowbolt spam the primary target without ripping aggro often as long as I have salv. Pretty much every druid/paladin tank accomplishes this and about half of warriors do.
---
Holy shit, the layers.
---
Level 55 and I've seen 1 grenade thrown.
---
I mean there's entirely different teams who worked on Vanilla vs teams who worked on later expansions. Not to mention different shareholders.
---
Get ready for it to get even worse
---
Crossrealm BG's :D 
---
With crossrealm BGs there's literally NO reason to balance factions since queue times will be short anyway :)
---
Don't like the group rules, don't join the group. 
---
Want to make your own rules or play by the default rules, make your own group.
---
The world is your oyster babe.
---
I don't want hunter to pull any thread because the moment you FD and I haven't hit the mob a single time, it runs for the healer meaning I have to chase the mob instead of tanking what's in front of me.
---
And if taunt misses, oh boy is it gonna be fun wiping.
---
He is an officer though. Maybe they are doing lootcouncil?
---
I was dead set on discussing those pairs. Thank you for your thoughts on them.
---
They have no reason to help you here 
---
They could easily get you the item but it’s not worth their time 
---
A hacked acc is an issue to be dealt with
---
Corsair K63 with lapboard. Get it.
---
This is silly you can lay waste to most camps by yourself on retail after like 40 lol
---
Right i dont know why im so surprised
---
I don't blame them for my mistake, I blame them for not offering reasonable support.
---
1. watch twitch
---
2. roll mage
---
3. spam "LFM AOE FARM GRP" in trade/world chat
---
4. complain the game has no content
---
nah
---
Sometimes I give them a small tip if I'm feeling generous, or if they're giving an enchant that'll really help me out, but if they're saying free and are gonna be mad if someone takes it literally, then they shouldn't be saying free.
---
This usually happens if the mobs are higher level than you, which can happen easily if you do a dungeon with a wide level spread. You start out with the mobs being your level, and by the end of it, they are five levels higher than you.
---
Alliance ftw!
---
I expected horde though, as they seem to be having more positive experiences with pvp. My observation is that it’s almost only alliance that complains about pvp making leveling impossible, and I don’t think it’s because alliance players are wimps (could be a part of it, but probably a minor one)
---
Urgh that's just really shitty.
---
End result is going to be few to no alliance players on PvP servers outside a few main guilds and all the horde whining they can't find any world PvP/have massive BG queues.
---
I wonder why that will be...
---
Yeah, against raid bosses - I'm talking dungeon tanking sorry.
---
that feel xD
---
Am I doing the wrong thing? I'm not rolling need after others have greeded. I'm encouraging everybody to roll the same, need. Perfectly balanced chances of success. I'm not cheating the system, I'm leveling the playing field.
---
Door stoppers are always NPCs.
---
I haven't seen many beggers yet.. does this mean the market is still open ?
---
That’s when you reply and tell them to fuck back off to retail where they belong with that attitude.
---
I mean, there’s only so much room for mages at endgame, they’re all gonna be sitting around with their mana biscuits up their asses when actual raid groups are full up on casters and they’re already on shit lists for acting that way.
---
When using a quick loot addon holding shift doesnt work for unlocking boxes without ninjaing the contents. It is annoying. I have been just popping into setting and turning off auto loot when a locked chest comes up un dungeons.
---
A macro that would disable and enable that setting would be awesome.
---
The problem is most of the time you only have a group that thinks they are good and can straight slam dunk the dungeon and ends up causing wipes and frustration.
---
Okay, quick question. I bought a 20 stack of Nightfin Soup, every time I’ve used it, I sat for the full duration, with no other buffs, and never received an indicator at the top of my screen that it activated. Any idea what’s happening?
---
Unga boonga streams bad
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA.
---
*inhale*
---
AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA!
---
I had similar experience trying BfA , the first hour of trying out high level heroes was so mind nummingly boring I tried out another class that I remembered as fun and was faced with exactly the same experience,
---
Logged out and erased the game.
---
I just can't understand how can people enjoy retail wow,(aside the most hc of hc raiding)
---
Real talk. Came for the spicy comments and not disappointed
---
The Monsters are Due on Maple Street is my jam. Might be part of why The Burbs is one of my favorite movies.
---
How do you “gank” someone but don’t know who won? The word “gank” implies you won, otherwise it was just an attempt.
---
Idk how much it changed in later expansions but some of the female design in Classic look like the cliché of the nerds' fantasy of female characters in rpg, revealing armour and such.
---
If you were already going to town to vendor why didn’t you mail it to an alt :(
---
Yeah, FD is a great tool if you get the aggro mid fight but as you pull the first mob, tanking is hell for a tank that has to chase mobs instead of tanking them - and fuck me if taunt misses.
---
I play healer. If you ever have aggro it's the tanks fault. Even a ranged mob hitting you the tank should be using demo/battle shout to establish atleast some threat. Don't make excuses for bad tanks. It's really not that hard.
---
Just worked 8 hours, then played for 3... bedtime
---
Yeah, talent choices are always interesting, as they're highly reliant on not just the fact that you're not solo leveling, but also the specific class you're leveling with.
---
I dont mind spell cleave to much. Its just annoying to see it for every group it seems
---
the /4 channel is 90% spell/melee cleave groups.  I just want to do a normal dungeon man. I dont want to roll against 4 mages for one piece of gear.
---
This is the correct viewpoint.
---
Disagree if you want, but this is how most people viewed BoE epics in 2005 and in 2019. You're welcome to disagree but don't be surprised when 4 people roll need and you roll greed.
---
Additionally, in any group I've been in, when a BoE epic drops everybody freezes and waits to see what others will do. This is 95% of the time followed by the group leader saying "all need", everyone needs, and everyone says grats to the winner. This has been the case to upgrades I could've used, and upgrades others could of used, and no feeling were hurt as everyone understood what liquidity is.
---
 Sucks to be rogue tgo couse all hunter, warriors, paladins, shamans wants ur leather and their main gear..
---
I’m the only engineer in my guild currently
---
That's gunna be a yikes from me dawg!
---
There must be friends on your current server you haven't found? You can play with the other two when you hit 60. I personally would stay put if I was you
---
Nope, only the specific school of magic.
---
I really enjoy dungeon groups with only one Mage and no warlock or vice versa. You get all of the wonderful AoE and CC abilities but only having one AoE means that no one expects massive 8 mob pulls.
---
This is why I laughed at the people who raced to 60. Phase 2 is likely to begin next year.
---

Bet these guys feel like they're PvP gods, too.
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again: If you play Horde on a PvP server, you're a pussy. No exceptions.
---
I'm just a Troll, standing in front of an Orc, asking them to love me.
---
This item is still in retail...
---
Lol as soon on TV.
---
Not an alt but old main. Rerolled from 25 shaman to a now 37 mage.
---
Both mining skinning. No plans for my shaman for atleast 3 more months.
---
&gt;DUNEGON
---
is the Dune gone?
---
Found the mage
---
ThEy ArE nOt PlAyInG tHe GaMe ThE sAmE wAy As Me WaHhH wAhHh
---
And I am playing a warrior. Do what you like and let other people do what they like...
---
I agree with this, it feels like Blizzard tried to add in fake latency to emulate crappie internet from 2004.
---
Maybe he is rp’ing an illiterate orc ?
---
Supplying water to a dungeon group is part of the deal. You're gonna take a healer that charges for heals too?
---
tell that to the frost mage that was pulling close to 1k dps and topping the total damage chart in my raid the other day
---
You only feel like a discount X if you stick to doing only one thing. Druids in Classic are proper hybrids, not "pick a single role at 10 hybrids".
---
I guess they have demand in Azeroth becauae vendors buy them
---
This happened to me tanking twice as a warrior... took about 5 runs for the ring to drop and the healing shammy outrolled me. 
---
Days later I try again, 3 more runs and we have the ring drop. Two other warrior dps in group and I lose the roll again. Pfft..... this ring def takes the wind out of your sails.
---
Fair enough, healers especially need to adapt to having dps groups like that. It's by far the fastest and best dps and truly can be amazing and fun. But if the team isn't very good or just wants a slow boomer experience, then that is fine too.
---
I’m a warlock I’ve been noticing that mobs are often evading my first hit entirely. 
---
Sometimes my succubus will hit the mob and then be taken out of combat and start running back. Then the mob will start to attack the succubus as it finally registers combat. 
---
This also happens sometime with my first spell if I cast before sending in my succubus. I’ll cast immolate and corruption back to back and both will be evaded and then the mob will register combat so I’ll have to recast both at that point. 
---
Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this?
---
zoomed in, probably so you can't see him clicking his abilities 😝
---
It seems the meta is now people hating on noob mages coming from retail who have no idea how to play properly. I only play mage and druid and am leveling both but not sure who my main should be. It seems most people would still group with a mage, even two mages, over a druid of any spec. Is this true in your experience? I am focused solely on leveling and 5 mans and not end game raiding.
---
Oh, thats new to me. Thx!
---
I was thinking his response was satire...but if its not...
---
I would do it *with permission* even in dungeons against known hard hitting mobs. Tank can get a few things before I need to heal, so zero threat generated.
---
I'm not sure it I'd consider people who fully immerse themselves in this game to be "casual". If anything I consider these types to be the most hardcore of all of us. I think you have it backwards.
---
Lemmings bad...smash wit hammer.
---
Both, I suppose. I won’t be chaining dungeons nonstop, but I’m not usually concerned with survivability while questing
---
Cloth, leather, and mail snows up all over paladin bis lists. You're just gonna have to get used to this one.
---
Dont forget aoe mage bad
---
TSM does the same thing with a little setup.
---
Servers are so big, sharing your document won't have any measurable impact. Just some perspective
---
UO may have awoken common use of MMORPG, but I'd argue that the honour would go to Meridian 59.
---
Go pound sand with your self justification dude.  This has literally been how the system has worked for the entirety of the game. 
---
Do you regularly hand out 100s of gold to randoms in your dungeon runs?
---
Because that is what you are asking people to do by passing on BoE items.  
---
In a perfect world yes, the sure if you equip it now mentality works.  But in an online game with no repercussions there is absolutely nothing stopping that guy from saying I need it to use it and then hearthing the fuck out never to be seen again.
---
that how it works, paladins needs cloth if they want to be a healer.
---
It gets much better at level 20 when you get Seal of Command, your bread and butter ret talent.  I don't have or follow a guide, but can answer any other questions you have.
---
If you want to grind out gold, there are plenty more ways to do it then taking somebody else's gear. If you want to get everything off the auction house, that's on you and you're more than welcome to it. Don't drag other people down with you.
---
Sure, I'm not saying WoW is in exactly the same boat. I think Blizzard has more sense than a company like Jagex which seems amazingly mismanaged from many angles. But I also do think greed wins in the upper levels of management, if for no other reason that people can be replaced if not living up to the desired fiduciary duty profits.
---
I'm quite curious to see what, if any, effect Classic will have on Current. On one hand, if it is genuinely more popular (hard to gauge in the honeymoon period before people hit the wall of "no more content") then Classic+ or moving ahead with Burning Crusade etc seems likely, with maybe some design changes for the next expansion of Current. But at the same time, BfA got so much flak that if the next thing is improved it may just be because of Current playerbase opinions, not necessarily Classic affecting Current. Not to mention there are groups on both sides that are diehard on either wanting the old ways or wanting QoL and new features so I'm not even sure if it's that worth listening to like Classic players' opinions on Current if they don't have an intention to play Current. It seems the relevant group would be people who dropped Current for Classic.
---
Idk I was having fun. Im around level 24 but one thing that stinks is the stat stick weapon thing. When playing a DPS role that feeling of a new weapon or big stat jump is super nice and I just dont get that from my druid.   
---
what I did love was the flexibility. Dropping out of bear or cat to heal and being able to tank or heal or dps in dungeons is fantastic. Giving a go with a Shaman now -- lets see if it lasts!
---
have you gotten the rogue diary yet with a required 5000 lock picking skill to open it.
---
Well you're lying or wrong because that's the one addon I have and it looks the exact same
---
What if the person Who rolls Need, the Item wild be automaticly turns in to a BoP in his Bags
---
You are aware that slower than current progression is not a real thing, right?
---
I promise we’re not all like this
---
Disagree - transmog felt cheaper because cool armour could be gained by facerolling old expansion content. It could be a good activity to do at lvl 60 when getting good looking gear requires doing relevant content
---
Finding a ZF group is pretty goddamn cancer tho. I wouldn't exclude the possibility of them getting  so frustrated, They'd actually quit.
---
Not really. Unless you are being trained, you are harder to kill than dps is. Healers can carry a bg. Dps rarely can.
---
Yeah phase 5 for 2h is pretty shit. Phase 3 is more reasonable but still a ways away. Thanks for the clarity, I figured some stuff was uncertain.
---
Oh yeah, that's a good idea, my bad lol.
---
This was really nice to see...I've been struggling a lot making so many alts. I have fun playing the game but at the same time I'm a huge altoholic and I cant decide on one class to play the game which kind of turns me away from playing. Did you use to beat yourself up for jumping around so much?
---
Over the course of 8 hours worth of running, after vendoring all the grays/junk and selling all the greens i got the following each hour.
---
1h - 47g
---
2h - 33g
---
3h - 39g
---
4h - 108g(1 BoE Blue &amp; 1 BOE epic Dropped, won the epic)
---
5h - 51g
---
6h - 52g
---
7h - 44g
---
8h - 93g(3 Boe Blues and a ton of greens dropped).
---
For a total of 467g, This is not counting the cloth that dropped as well as I kept those since i'm a tailor.
---
If this is the norm and thought process wouldn't everyone roll need on everything? I had, and do roll greed on all blue boe items I'm not going to equip. As a pug we ran SM Cath and some blue boe's dropped we all greeded. Another blue boe drops and we all greed and one guy needs. The healer wouldn't continue until he equipped it. Seemed fair to me. If you roll "need" then you need it, ie you use it. If it's greed then you plan on selling/vendoring it.
---
You should try doing dungeons, people seem to chat more while doing them. Also if you are good at your role you will get friend requests as well. 
---
So far outside questing has been about 50/50 for me, half are what you describe and half we end up playing together for an hour or so.
---
Yea, I get that a lot, maybe would have had an impact in middle school. Now that I'm older, just graduated and working as a scientist, I frankly don't really care.
---
I just try to have fun the way I do and if that entails talking with others about shows, games, other topics that we like, and helping others is cringe than cringe it is.
---
You do you mate.
---
Yes! I had it happen to me in LBRS once. There was some bug with a quest I was doing on my own. The instance was done and I popped back in to do something for the UBRS key. A GM appeared next to me and honestly I don’t even remember if they were able to fix the quest because I had so much fun getting turned into different things. I got to keep a pirate buff for a while after. 
---
I should have screenshots somewhere but pretty sure the computer they were on is dead. I’ll have to try to recover them sometime.
---
Guessing sarcasm isn’t yours either
---
You have to make it scan the AH regularly, and it can takes up to 2h, not ideal but really useful. 
---
Personally, I just scan the AH for the items I have in my bags, takes 15min and I have all the info I need. It saves a lot of times for auctions, it will undercut automatically following your configuration.
---
Best response yet thank you for your detail!
---
How exactly does a group of 4 mages and a priest spamming dungeons ruin the game for Joe Hunter and Billy Shaman?
---
If you want to play the game as it was intended, then make your own group and bring Zoomer Tank, Joe Hunter, and Billy Shaman yourself.
---
BS
---
Your options are: 
---
A) He can barely speak english
---
B) He's very young and can barely read/write
---
C) He has no idea what you are talking about and has never heard of Scarlet Monastery being in sections.
---
This isn't a case of him being unhelpful.  This is just a case of him not having a clue what more he could possibly say.
---
It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce you probably don't want to join that group.
---
The ones just outside Menethil are good for this too.
---
What item was it?
---
Simple answer, there is no real "main quest" in classic. Each zone has a few storylines that start and end in that zone, followed by a breadcrumb quest to the next zone for your level. Sometimes you'll be asked to go to a bunch of different zones, like the Test of Lore quest chain that starts on Thousand Needles, or all the class quests.
---
That's a result of spellbatching?  Looting feels a little delayed compared to retail as well
---
I'm over here farming one by one along with 2 other guys near me. Everything is smooth. Mobs pop up in time so no one is really stepping on each other's toes. In comes a mage and fucks everything up by taking every mob within range. Fuck mages.
---
Same. But im that other side. I would like to have a conversation and knew you better but I only have an hour or less to play each day. Im doing a quest or finishing what I started a day before and thats it.
---
Yea, just finished Un’Goro. Just thought of this as a bunch of guildies were running BRD last night. Got to hear about all the gear they were getting in discord while I was trying to eradicate gorillas and dinos.
---
Well at least we Tanks can create the groups easily and reserve what ever you want..
---
Orbs, hoj, ironfoe. You are simply worth more than every other role.
---
If it's OK for me work eight hours a day and sleep eight hours a day, why is it not OK to spend the remaining eight hours on something I actually enjoy?
---
how to be the worst person in a group is what the title of this post should have been
---
A majority of my social interactions in Classic has been my guild chat. We have a fairly large guild of about 250 active peeps. Guild chat is always going and people love it when you jump into the conversation.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295273/classic-triples-wow-subscription-revenue-in-august
---
Does qualify and also almost a good name for an Asterix comic.
---
None is hating on people who are taking it slow buddy, you can play however the hell you like. Personally I like rushing 60 and then doing professions while waiting for dungeons and stuff, but sometimes especially when lvling warrior, I like taking it slow and getting mining+engi up and do lots of dungeons, makes warrior leveling really a fun experience.
---
Depends on your server and what dungeon. On high pop, my rouge friend has had no trouble getting into dungeons. I also love having on my team since hes usually top of the dps charts when we are doing normal dungeon runs
---
that's what a rogue would say
---
Thread's full of people telling me to stop excusing bad tanks. Lol.
---
Taunt resist, dodge sunder, block revenge, how is any of that tana's fault when I gotta heal the bastard as the mob ain't missing!
---
You’ll probably be best off in Silver Pine since that’s going to be your natural progression, but there are other options in and around the barrens as well to look into.
---
warrior is hard to level btw
---
tanking is hard btw
---
retails is bad btw
---
People shit on hunters because of weapons. Not gear with agility. Go ahead, reroll.
---
Need = equip. All else is greed/pass. This is the standard and anyone who disagrees won't play in my groups. Just saying.
---
This is my life as a feral druid tanking instances while leveling. Can't hit for shit and can't get aggro in anything other than bosses pretty much.
---
If the quest had bugged they would fix that as that was a problem on their end.  
---
You screwed up so they won't help you, just accept that it's your fault and take responsibility for your own actions.
---
Not really no, most good quests are chains. In the meantime I've seen plenty of barren areas with a high density of NPCs while travelling the world.
---
By all means have fun, I’m not saying you can’t have fun. I just don’t see the point in sharing something that happens constantly on pretty much every server. We’ll have Red Ridge gank videos in her next.
---
I understood that reference
---
1000,000,0000,000,0000 platinum on mine. Lowest *bid*
---
Vox: Were the WoW devs white supremacists?!
---
That’s not the same thing and you know it dude.  A BoE item benefits everyone in the group equally even if you can’t wear it.  
---
Why should I hand you 100s of gold when everyone in the group helped get to that point of the dungeon to be able to roll on the item in the first place.
---
While it sucks that it feels like they have a larger set of gear they can get (i.e. they roll on your stuff, but also other armor as you mention), keep in mind that they tend to contest with other classes a lot more than you do. You might have to fight pallys for cloth, but you don't have to fight Hunter for mail and warriors for plate like pallys do.
---
Honestly blues have not cause discussions, always went to someone if they could use it
---
Charge pulling is great! As long as you know you aren't going to body pull 3 other packs.
---
Magical spells and effects also applies to healing, however I don't know how many Warlock spells - if any - benefit from that. Other than that, the damage for shadow spells is identical point for point. Keep in mind that you have fire spell, too. They won't benefit from shadow spell damage obviously.
---
I have found a guild and added loads of players to friends list who always ask to play with me or fill a role. 
---
You get what you put in. Start a conversation next time you group up. Help someone out if they are being ganked. If you finish a quest with someone ask if they are doing the next ones etc.  Healers will often appreciate a dps grouping with em. 
---
Just some ideas. 
---
So far for me I have had way more meaningful interactions in game than retail.
---
This is literally what I’ve been refering to
---
What is a slow "boomer" experience? Boomer? What does that even mean, You know it refers to a generation right? 
---
But yes, Everyone has to adapt.
---
Does anyone know if farming Stanley is considered griefing according to Blizz?
---
Mobtagging is nerfed on classic because blizzard is a bunch of wussies, so it's not really good or worth your time. Just level by yourself and get help on the occasional dungeon clear or elite quests.
---
abort that rogue asap, roll a 2nd hunter
---
Sword from the SM Quest in Desolace, best lok too.
---
I've been making a good bit of money selling roasted raptor.  The recipe, though. Not the actual meat/food.
---
Gooooood. Retail needs to die so blizz will make WoW2 in Classic's image.
---
if i can /roll on the chest only the rogue can open, can i also /roll on the nodes only the miner can extract ?
---
The Barrens would probably be the best.  The Quillboars I reckon.
---
Also, the grim totem in stonetalon wouldn't be hard either, they're around 14-16 and have low hp.
---
I did 59-60 questing only as a lock in 3 hours 45 mins, didn't track other levels as closely and I am far from a speed runner.
---
Go to booty bay or gadgetzan and tell me it's "anecdotal".
---
The thing I'm not seeing is how 4 dudes and a healer aoe spamming instances stops me from playing the game as intended.
---
I've had no problem finding regular groups on my warlock and shaman.
---
Always upvote people that upvote techno viking.
---
Remindme! Tomorrow
---
THE PERILOUS DUNES OF GON!
---
Yeah I know. Just one more day dedicating all of my extra time to playing man.
---
Selling it on AH and buying an item you can use is the same thing as someone else equipping the item immediately..just a few extra steps.
---
I always invite everyone I can if it's a quest that solely involves killing. Melee are amazed how easily I can kill so many mobs. The number doesnt even matter, it really only boils down to how many I can pull.
---
Not worth it to keep running for that sword, hell I used cruel barb and thief’s blade from DM until level 39 when I got the sword upgrades from the SM and RFD quests. You’ll be fine, I’d move on and do some quests. At 31 you could do some Southshore and early STV quests, you may also have some quests left over to do in duskwood.
---
Yeah that's exactly what they do. Though it is a spectrum of stupidity; some don't even taunt, or use any AoE effects. Some are even terrible pullers; pulling way too much purely due to their incompetency. 
---
That was fun to heal. Slamming heals on the tank, who then turned to me since he did nothing to grab their aggro. Probably would've left if it weren't the DPS peeling them off. Main reason we stayed with that tank, was for the easier bosses, really.
---
check out  [http://www.wowclassicbis.com/](http://www.wowclassicbis.com/) 
---
and select Holy paladin, there you can see that the BiS for Paladins contains a lot of Cloth.
---
I play on mankrik, and my experience has been nothing but positive! Making friends left and right, always having a dungeon group or someone needing some tailoring or some other service, I have found it is an absolute blast
---
Not sure if you're arguing against this, but for what it's worth I'm like 99% sure in either wrath or vanilla I was getting hit by mobs when I cheapshotted them. If it was in wrath then I have to assume it was in vanilla as well.
---
Disabling replies.
---
Yes and yes.
---
In my last year of playing retail and classic, I have met some awesome GM's and not had a single bad response in 5-10 tickets. I've had the total opposite experience.
---
It’s only to low pop servers, though.
---
Just dont join that group? would you prefer them not tell you, and then just ninja it?
---
Find another group?
---
Those were the days. Jeez I'm getting old.
---
BS 
---
There are differences between ponds and ocean iirc doe
---
That is an intersting fact, I learned some swedish today, thanks man.
---
But, no swede I have encountered is this dumb though. Going with my misspelling theory still.
---
That explains alot
---
Or Norwegian. Or maybe even Danish, not sure. If that was the case his English would probably be better though.
---
According wowhead there are 3 cloth pieces that are BiS, 2 leather, 1 mail, and the rest plate.....  I'll be down voted, and don't care.  This evidently means that all cloth should go to paladins, and mages should depend on iceblock, and AoE grinding for epics?  
---
The only decent explanation I was able to settle on is that if it was a priest they'd roll against you too.
---
Beware the entitled comments that are surely coming.  My opinion is that with all of the gearing options for paladins plate\mail\leather\cloth they should defer to mages/locks when able.  That won't happen because us cloth wearers with one gear option(cloth) are entitled and don't want to share. /s
---
As the case with most people who make the comparison. 
---
"I haven't played wow in 10 years but I tried the free trial for 5 minutes and hated it! Why is the random server I was on in 2008 dead??"
---
As far as Im concerned, if you arent going to equip the item you have no business rolling need. The greed option is for people that want to sell the item.
---
You do realize a single crit can be enough to get aggro from a tank regardless how how many buttons he could press every 1.5 seconds?
---
It is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to pull threat as dps in Vanilla than it is for a tank to keep it. The only reason this wouldn't be the case is if your DPS is garbo.
---
I would sell it now if possible.
---
I fully agree with this.
---
Dude you are blaming him for using advantages thar mage class offer.
---
Gave me a chuckle. Most people don't brag about blowing their load as early as possible.
---
If you're getting off on pulling threat instead of making a more enjoyable experience for the group(reducing their downtime/clear speed/etc), don't be surprised if people aren't happy with your performance. If you can't manage threat, you don't belong in group content.
---
Approved!
---
I can understand the first argument, however for the second one, I don't see the balance in the scale of Ashenvale's logging, the spirits must be going apeshit and I don't see how the Horde's shamans can stand idle
---
&gt;Certain armor pieces being more "revealing" for female characters. 
---
I think that's alive and well in Retail still. I know of the term "slutmog" from Retail-playing friends, and "mog" is definitely not an old feature.
---
Opinion: Rogue isn’t a great class to farm, I’d suggest Druid for an alt simply because of run speed. Hoofing it with normal foot speed is going to work against you.
---
Not an insult. Just an observation. It’s not about their passive but the Berserking ability.
---
Leather balls are fun.
---
This particular dragon heals like crazy when it kills players, and one of its abilities is an AoE shadow bolt. So in cities, it's constantly healing and requires GM intervention to get rid of
---
I've seen it on AH on Faerlina 2x. Can confirm it is in the game.
---
&gt; no point in calling me stupid and saying the post is shit other than just being unnecessarily cruel.
---
No, don’t it words in my mouth. Behave.
---
Is Halttür taken? (Was Hodor given another name in german translations?)
---
Depends on how much time the person who rolled 99 has to play.  
---
If 5 hours a day or more: "bah, a bump in the road. I'll just grind it out. Yay WoW!"  
---
If 1 hour a day max: "I am defeated. No more"
---
Holy cow ! TLDR ?
---
You want two addons: Omni CC &amp; ClassicBuffTimers. Get both and you can see how many seconds the CC will last
---
For SnD you would have to use weak auras
---
Shift clicking works for me
---
&gt;Cool. Before you head off on your moral-high-ground high, consider how much you've insulted me over a basic debate concerning looting practices
---
Insulted you how? By calling you a pessimist and thinking that if you believe the worst in people, it's a sad way to live? Yeah, well I guess I'm guilty.
---
&gt;that I'm attempting to prevent system abuse and protect my groups from ninjas.
---
And I can prevent you from being killed in a car accident if you let me lock you in your home. Preventing abuse by abusing is a silly idea.
---
&gt;If you're so desperate to be the "good guy" in a Reddit argument, you may consider going about it differently next time.
---
Seal form was consolation for "competitive class" not being entirely true.
---
I see, but Is a warlock fun to level?
---
This post gets my seal of approval.
---
I find retail has been doing this incredibly well too the last 2 expansions at least.
---
Yeah, there's a range to the "Find X" skills.. so the addon is almost just as good.
---
People's minds were already mush.  It's a weird mentality where they think the only way to play is how whoever the popular streamer is doing it because it's the fastest.  Communication?  Nah, everyone should know what they're doing so there's no need to waste time with that.  Gotta get that loot, if you ain't first you're last.
---
The latest encounter of which I personally had, was this past weekend.
---
&gt; This has literally been how the system has worked for the entirety of the game.
---
Not on my Vanilla server. I'm sorry you played on a server full of shitty people who pulled you down to their level.
---
You can also just have a tank pull em.
---
Nobody shits on hunters needing on agility gear, that's what they use. People shit on bad hunters needing on gear that doesn't have stats they need. Most caster gear is cloth, right? And paladin healers are casters, right? Therefore, it makes sense that paladin healers would roll on cloth. You're just bitter that you lost a roll.
---
LFG MELEECLEAVE CATH WITH RAVAGER PLS
---
Don't forget the "I'm out of ammo" melee hunters.
---
Amen my holy brother. Let them die and get a tasty 10% durability loss if they can’t grasp the concept of a tank initiating pulls.
---
You uh, just said the same thing with more words, as if I didn't directly address that point, when i did.
---
And you are wrong. Healing is the role I play when I want to sit back and not give a fuck, because it is so autopilot it hurts. 
---
I mean, I guess when things go bad it gets hard? But that SHOULD happen very rarely, and even then if you just fail to bail them out it really isn't your fault. Tank either overpulled or DPS couldn't control the kill order. 
---
90% of the time, when anyone blames the healer, they are wrong. Sometimes healers are genuinely bad but most of the time it was just a bad situation and they are incapable of blaming themselves.
---
The scuba helmet isn’t too bad of an option tbh, until I receive bloodfang hood. You my friend is an  entrepreneur
---
Well yeah but his Hunter is 38 so I assumed he was skinning thick which AH well over vendor price and is needed for lots of important stuff and sells for minimum 1g/stack on ah
---
2%, not horrible.
---
Not sure what the problem is. If you don't want to play with him then don't and whatever "relationship" you have will quickly fade out. If he spams you with questions, straight up tell him you don't wish to work as a google replacement.
---
Years ago when I played csgo, I sometimes did lowkey coaching for novice people I found complaining on reddit. I quickly realized it wasn't worth the effort since typically a person who is awful at games, yet wishes to improve but hasn't managed that is unable to learn (and when it comes to csgo, crippling case of zero confidence) which you can't really help. Following that, they keep on being bad and use you as a vehicle for help and for releasing frustration which is annoying to be target of.
---
For shamans specifically, each healing wave is slightly more efficient than the last with weak or no healing power gear. The turnover is around 200 healing power when rank 5 and 7 become notably more efficient.
---
Use a lure for the first like 50 levels or so, you'll be much more successful.
---
Need epics greed blues need blues if you gonna wear.
---
&gt; It’s gold that dropped from the dungeon and everyone rolls.
---
No, gold drops plenty form dungeons and it gets split evenly. You can check your chat logs if you're confused about it.
---
Everything but warrior is fun to level
---
Is that BT?
---
The payoff is in pvp imo. Buddy up with a warrior and absolutely wreck everything in sight
---
r/ihadastroke
---
&gt; running in as a paladin
---
Yeah I hate when this happens too
---
I have a secret Warrior (18) I play when I don't feel like leveling my Mage (53). My Mage spoils him.
---
&gt; Found the problem. You're trying to build threat on a mob that you're going to taunt anyway, why? And stop using Revenge on the non-skull when your threat is dicey.
---
Because if he's just pulled aggro and it's start of the fight, one Revenge/Sunder is probably going to be enough to pull the mob back to me anyway
---
&gt; Taunt has what 4 seconds left on it by then? Your DPS can deal with a mob hitting him for 4 seconds, for most mobs that's two swings at most.
---
You plan to run 30 yds over to hit Taunt, or just pray that your DPS is smart enough to bring the mob to you?
---
&gt; If you don't have safe threat on the Skull, then just let it be and taunt it when you can.
---
&gt; If you're safe with threat on the skull then fight for threat, obviously, that's your job. But if you're not comfortable with threat on the skull, the focus on that. There's no point building threat on a mob you're about to taunt.
---
&gt; Yup. Because you fought for threat on a mob that you're going to taunt anyway, instead of making sure you had safe threat on the skull by prioritising that one.
---
Maybe you run with only guild groups or something, but I have had extensive experience tanking across multiple expansions beginning in vanilla and it has definitely seemed like a majority of PUGs really don't care about doing things like hitting only the skull, or waiting for the tank to build threat. Especially now after years of aggro tables being pretty much irrelevant in retail. And sure, you could say to just let them die, but that's really not the most efficient way to do PUGs since they're more likely to just call you a bad tank and abandon the group than learn from their mistakes. Much easier overall to just grab the aggro on all of the mobs, even if it is a lot harder on multiple mobs.
---
Last night I played my hunter with some random rogue in the Wetlands killing gnolls. Some warrior across the river pulls an entire camp of gnolls. They kill him... and then begin to chase me. They crossed all the little streams, marched across a huge swathe of the map and didn't deaggro until I was dead.  
---
I rez. 10 minutes pass. We're killing a gnoll on the outskirts of their camp. The entire camp aggros onto me for absolutely no reason, we weren't that close to it and we didn't pull. They just randomly aggroed and chased me down and killed me again. It isn't even my pet's fault, I'm just a cursed hunter!
---
Fully agree
---
theres basically no difference between questing in tank spec or questing in a cat spec. theres only 3 cat specific talents a tank spec probably wouldnt get - feral aggression, improved shred, and blood frenzy. improved shred is useless since you arent attacking from behind. blood frenzy probably doesnt matter since your crit isnt that high. and feral aggression probably doesnt matter because things die before you can even build up 5 combo points to use a finisher
---
IT'S A COOKBOOK!!!!!!
---
Just wait until the 50s...
---
Someone please make this into a shitty comic
---
Don't listen to this spammer, check it out yourself.  
---
 [https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/heartseeker/10](https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/heartseeker/10) 
---
It's even until levelcap.. then completely alliance.  
---
Worse, the 60's have decided to stop horde leveling in contested zones. They spread out between quests and gank 24/7.
---
It was trivial in WotLK. Should be quite easy in TBC.
---
Just play more than one...  It's entertaining and you can boost the alt for cheap.  Even easier if you have a compatible profession. Rested  XP will reduce the grind for xp.
---
That holds until rank 4. But sub rank 4 takes a penalty to healing power efficiency and is generally such a small amount of healing it's negligeable at endgame content.
---
Deathstriker, how I missed you.
---
&gt; Needing prevents ninjas, and if you win you can always give to the one who can equip it if you want.
---
When everybody is a ninja, nobody is?
---
On the off chance that you just mean the coloring of the game, I post processed it a little bit after I took it to give it a better look. The original picture was really dark in comparison
---
You have to start in a low area and use lures pretty much at all times.
---
This is a map that tells you the skill needed to fish in a zone as well as avoid get aways: https://i.imgur.com/CIyfpkJ.jpg
---
I hit Lay On Hands on our tank and it legit took my cooldown but they still died.
---
I thought I was playing FFXIV again for a second.
---
Id say try making an alt,  see if you enjoy the leveling process more.   You can always play both if you arent stressed about reaching end game asap.
---
Ugh no one talks in our guild but me! Then they leave because it’s too quiet but don’t talk themselves. Weirdest fucking thing, ugh.
---
Damn, this is perfect! Thanks!
---
Huh. Well the more you know.
---
I try and keep a constant pace, Pull a 1-2 packs and as the last mob is on low life i will swap to Berserker stance and intercept (The in combat charge) to the next pack to keep the pace up.
---
But i always make sure to keep an eye on the healers mana because no mana makes for a sad panda.
---
Home many times has this guy used "..."?
---
Someone's gotta put bread on the table, and not everyone's a mage like me. ;)
---
Found the "spell cleave" mage.
---
Shift right clicking has been working for me
---
There's a minimum level to realistically catch fish for each zone.
---
For the first 100 levels just fish in one of the 1 to 10 zones.
---
There will always be jealous people who will instantly attack you as no-life etc. It's been like this since online games became a thing sadly. It's pretty easy to do long grind things when you set it as a goal and ONLY focus on it.
---
How did the grind go? How much gold did you get on the side? Any BoE epics drop?
---
I myself rushed to 60 pretty quick and my current goal is my epic mount. I farm every free hour i can. Park right next to my spot and have 2 backup spots if they are busy when i get on (with layering it's not). I would have my epic already if i didn't buy the devilsaur set and a great deal on a world bis epic weapon for my class. Working on the coffers again!
---
Great job, i personally don't mind the grind for stuff but that one i would never personally attempt!
---
Good point. I'm sure that didn't help.
---
haha same
---
Git Gud
---
Oh hey I have an anecdote too. 
---
If you mark a target as skull, you better have aggro on it 100% of the time. Stop trying so hard to keep threat on the 2-3 mobs that dps aren’t attacking.
---
Sure!
---
Rogues have a very hard time in the teens.  It will get slightly better in the 20s, but rogues really don't feel complete until 30ish.
---
Use pick pocket as much as possible.  This will be your main source of health potions unless you funnel them from your alch.  Max out your first aid, too.  Bandaging after killing a mob when you have another sapped is often necessary.
---
Looks almost like questie, which is my recommendation
---
GY *maybe*, but Cath? Can you actually AoE farm that with holy nova? Or are you just grinding through it non-AoE? How did you get enough mana to spam Nova that much?
---
Your target isnt level 30 for artisan trades, it is 35.  You'll have to bite the bullet all the way to 35 if you want your alt to have 225+ LW.  12 hours invested into a character won't matter too much in the bigger scheme of things.  If you don't love playing a rogue (which is a very fun class) I'd say go with something you're more familiar with if LW is your priority.
---
&gt; Remember, if it's not a Spooker, you'll get ooked in the dooker. 
---
Aaaaaand that's how advertising works.
---
It will have to wait for when i make horde alts, so will prob take a while.
---
You're right. Your one area of excellence in this game is being an over-excited border collie.
---
It says "up to" because it depends on the cast time of the spell. Spells with a base cast time of 3sec or longer get the full amount . So +8 is straight +8. From there it scales down to 1.5 seconds/instant, which gets ~35%, so +10 would add 3-4 to each cast. HoT/DoTs it's split over the duration so just take the number you'd expect and divide it by the number of ticks baseline a hot has for its full duration.
---
*Some of my numbers might be off cause I didn't double check. Someone feel free to give the real numbers if you have them.
---
I would have loved them to not bring back battlegrounds.
---
At 0 healing power, each tier of healing wave is more efficient than the last. It's around 200 healing power when ranks 5 and 7 start to stand out in particular.
---
Don’t you have to make your own robe though? I wouldn’t be able to sell the second so it would be better to sell the extra mats on the AH.
---
I’m throwing nades without hesitation
---
I doubt that. The mentality of this game has changed.
---
Yup. I main heals and add any good tanks to my friends and suggest they add me too if they are looking for heals in the future. 
---
Some I’ve gotten to know quite well, and I call on them first before looking for others for dungeons. Even had a few reach out to help with a quest or two where they needed a pocket healer.
---
The way I think of it is why spend time doing something that sells for a few silver (low level mats) when I could spend that same amount of time doing the same thing for a higher selling mat. So I'll level skinning just to level it but in the 30s and 40s I'm going to skin every beast I come across.
---
And then at 60 you're oy wanted for healing.
---
I think you are confusing surprise with disgust.  Disgust at the culture of lemming sucking at what they are trying to do . Speaking in twitch memes and typing out .gif names cuz the sooo coo.
---
Eh, it's kind of a waste of a GCD
---
some of us like to cook, alright?! also sprint is a speed boost...
---
Are people really that spitefull and downvote my comment just because I don’t have a lot of free time?
---
And I'm sure, if we all wait long enough, you'll be able to explain why.
---
ya you seem like you are actually a good tank then. I'm a mage (obviously) and when I double mage I like tanks that pull like you, its by far the best middle ground and still optimizing aoe without stupid pulling
---
This is why you ALWAYS agree to ALL NEED on BOE epics.
---
That way, no one can be cheated out of the roll.
---
Soooo goood
---
&gt;Was pre-patch in Nov of that year?
---
It was December 5th, 2006.
---
You might be fishing in too high an area for your skill. Try a lure or going to a lowbie zone / main city to fish there and see if you're having the same problem. I've been leveling fishing and I've never had a problem with fish not being there when I click on the bobber.
---
To be clear, you're clicking after the little animation where the bobber jerks up and down quickly and there's a small splash of water, right?
---
In case you haven't seen from comments above, this is Darnassus! The color is a bit more exaggerated because I post processed the image some to make less dark
---
I remember my first group as a hunter after TBC launched. Somebody had an addon that would whisper me every time my pet did something to cause aggro like thunderstomp (?) or growl. I had no idea you can turn them off and was freaking out so bad trying to figure out wtf my pet was doing. It was a pretty "huntard" moment for me. :|
---
No it works very well and I use it. It just doesn't integrate with atlas. It even has it's own maps part. Just doesn't have the quests. :)
---
As a new player am I best just to try any of the classes to get a feel for the enjoyment?
---
Only thing useful is getting help with very hard/high level quests which have good rewards, lile getting help to grind for Whirlwind Weapon at 30. Or getting a dungeon boost early like DM or SFK at 15 which will give very good items to use later.
---
Earthshock!!! And if I really want to embarrass a tank, ROCKBITER WEAPON!!
---
Yeah except when there are ranged mobs in the group, which is only like 90% of the time. There's a reason why the list of viable spots for mages to grind is pretty short.
---
At least as a rogue I can use feint which helps the tank get aggrieved back lol
---
Use a lure, always period. The cheap ones cost basically nothing and improve time efficiency when fishing by a lot, unless you fish in waters that are massively below your fishing skill.
---
He has a ress that has a cost to it. That’s the point. Don’t do stuff for free for randoms when it costs you something.
---
Good to know, thanks.  
---
Anecdotally I'm aligned with the last of the data, but always take that with salt.
---
I sneaked into feralas at lv35 and maxed out 300 lol, so I guess there's no point in using lures now?
---
Sarcasm
---
Thanks! Is there a reason to have both? It seems like they're doing the same thing but I haven't used them yet
---
why would the combination of "2 mages and a warlock" make it hard to hold threat? threat is individual per player. one person pulling aggro has absolutely nothing to do with the other dps in the party. if a single mage is pulling threat, then adding 2 more mages doesnt change that
---
I think faction specific queue times could work, and might be the easiest/ fastest fix.  The problem there is if a faction population never recovers you are just reducing server size for no reason.  
---
What about incentives. Like if you play alliance on this server you get 1.5x the experience? Or like 10% off mounts? Obviously those examples are probably a little busted, but you get the idea.
---
Lol shouldn’t have spit on me 100 times, tbagged me over and over, and ruined my game time with my wife.
---
The rppvp servers seem to favor alliance just a bit.
---
Back in the day we had the concept of "educational deaths". If a tank pulled something like that more than once (once can always be a brainfart, everybody has those on occasion): Just don't join the fight.
---
Watch them die, resurrect them (sorry druids...) and explain calmly that when you sit, you don't heal.
---
I mean, the best source of gold actually is grinding mobs with great grey drop loot tables. 
---
Cat mobs in SoS and STV can net you 7g an hour on vendor items alone. They are around level 33-40 I believe. So you might be able to find some you can still get decent exp on as well. As a priest you have some of the BEST consistency with mob killing only behind hunter (and that is questionable because they need to maintain pet health with mana). You can grind efficiently and easily. That is likely the best source of income and doubles as a decent way to level. 
---
Of course the best time to money activity would be playing the AH. Anything from buying stuff for cheaper than vendor to flipping. But that is risky as hell, and some people just aren't able to do it.
---
This is why Blizzard majorly dumbed down tanking in ~~Legion~~ Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Try to rely mostly on Revenge as your "go to" threat ability. Use Shield Block to keep it procced as often as possible. Sunder alone is a super Rage hog and isn't as good Threat-per-rage as Revenge/SB. Be really careful to not "overtank" mobs. Meaning: try not to dump a 15 Rage Sunder into a mob that is already attacking you and is almost dead.
---
Mostly, just inform groups that you are already rage-starved as it is - things to waaaay smoother when you have everyone focus DPS on a single mob. Even if you plan to AoE, tell them to kill the first mob before they start to AoE just so you can have a chance to build threat on them and the Healer's mana will last way longer.
---
Sometimes it honestly just takes kindly reminding people, or informing them for the first time. Lots and lots of people out there have no idea about how threat works. I had a Mage last night who thought he could just start Blizzarding as soon as I had Thunderclapped - he didn't know it would be better to pause and focus fire for a bit before starting, but was glad to learn how to make things easier for the group.
---
Very cool!  What add-on are you using that lists the vendor and auction deposit prices and stats?
---
Salty ally just mad I'm outing good techniques lmao
---
Schnitzel!
---
He’s deaf man, that’s fucked up.
---
Nah.
---
Lol yeah woops
---
Had this in Mara yesterday.i was stood on top of the tank jumping up and down, but he either didn't care that I was getting murdered and popped all my CDs to survive.
---
Had to run for miles.
---
Muh Cleave meta bad
---
Stacks of oilies and firefins are currently selling for 1s each on my server. Stacks will get posted for 17-20s.
---
Pretty sure fishing right now is a net negative for me when compared to just grinding mobs for gold. I'm mostly just fishing right now to level my skill.
---
Mage privilege.
---
&gt; Because to be honest it is always a show but we make it work
---
No, apparently *we* don't.
---
Apparently I am a God and you are a lowly peasant and there is no way someone like you could compete on my level because apparently I'm just *so good* that I can out-threat every DPS in the game.
---
Yep. Couldn't possibly be your own fault. Couldn't possibly be your own shitty attitude.
---
Nope. I must be Warcraft Jesus.
---
Bow to me, peasant.
---
I mean... we kept trying to tell people that "world PvP" would just be 99.999% ganking, and 0.001% group battles. Either way, PvE realms are there, waiting with open arms. Classic will be out for years, so don't waste that time by worrying about losing a month having to reroll. What's another month of leveling, when it saves you from years of pain and frustration?
---
1) Just turn off all sound except sound effects. you wont hear anything except the lure plop, as long as nobody else is nearby
---
Uhh I remember getting this on my lvl 1 bank twink with double arena grandmaster etc but on classic it seems to always be in shop in UC if I'm not mistaken?
---
It's literally he only thing I hate about classic, Lfg is just full of lfm mages for spellcleave
---
Everyone ITT saying it is impossible but I had a GM back in TBC do exactly that for me: total user error selecting the wrong item, went to equip it and realized what happened.
---
I made a ticket and the GM removed the item from my inventory and sent the correct item to my mailbox.
---
If it’s impossible now, it’s because Blizzard fired all of the quality Game Masters and replaced them with people that don’t play the game and respond to issues with copy-pasted scripts.
---
so you're farming the wrong mobs lol?
---
How is that relevant?
---
that's just not true, especially on higher levels. you go to the quests hubs far more often than to capitals
---
also if you dungeon grind, then it almost never makes sense to HS capital, especially if doing dungeons that are annoying to get out of, like e.g. Maraudon, because leaving the instance party will TP you to where your HS is
---
Honestly yeah... i havent been picking up consumables from ah ... but prices are cheap and the market is flooded so ... its worth mentining
---
Fair enough.  Though there are plenty of options in-game to farm for gold and buy items, RMT isn't necessary.  That's true though the GM is incentivized to compel me to buy more =P
---
FWIW I never bought any currency, though I don't fault anyone who does.
---
“People are gonna do shitty things, so I might as well do shitty things too.”
---
Sweet argument.
---
Sticking to your macros question:   I'd throw in a /startattack  to automatically enable auto attack in case your charge misses.
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Charge  
---
&gt;/startattack  
---
&gt;/cast Battle Stance  
---
&gt;/cast Charge
---
Also,    I used to have this same macro but removed /cast charge because it caused some accidental pulls to happen in dungeons.
---
My wife would leave me if i was a crazy stalker like this.
---
I re-trolled at level 44, albeit that was from alliance to horde. But I did go mage this time around, instead of warlock and so glad I re-rolled. It took me a week 6 hours after work, and 10+ hours on the weekend to catch up, and I am now 47 mage... hope this helps your decision.
---
I should have taken a picture this weekend. I leveled a Warrior while my friend was driving 250 on the Autobahn. One more item off the bucket list.
---
Doesnt it ask you to confirm you are deleting the correct character
---
Bats in the plaguelands. I think it is EPL?
---
Be careful because they have nasty abilities, but I think they are around 53+ and have insanely profitable loot tables.
---
You might run into competition issues though.
---
I have noticed the exact same thing when grouping for quests.  People join we say hi, might chat for a minute, complete quest and then thanks and disband.  I have made one friend questing after we quested for about 4 hours together.  If I can I always try to see if we have other quests in common but most folks just don't seem interested.
---
The majority of my friends who I play with daily at this point I have met running dungeons. When running with random people I always try to get the group on voice chat and generally the folks that do are pretty cool and we end up doing more and more together. I'm up to 5 friends who all share the same schedule as me and play about the same amount.  
---
If you enjoy playing with someone don't be afraid to ask if you can add them as a friend.
---
That makes sense. Rogue doesn't kick in until 20 or so, and warrior really doesn't feel good until you get whirlwind axe. They're both great later on though.
---
What about shadow priest? It's a very strong leveler and solo pvper, but also gives you the option of healing at 60.
---
The hardest part of being a tank is educating everyone else what it takes to play a tank.
---
Mostly because then people suck at finishing blows and mobs have time to run for help -- often right before a boss.
---
So then you go into the boss fight at 50% mana.
---
**Dunegon, Destroyer of Worlds **
---
I also tip good for enchants? Im not a mage, i just said what i tip, always.
---
I've being doing that but there are still quite a lot of sounds, like why is waterfall not in ambient???
---
GENERIC EXCUSE
---
Met him a hour later in burning steps. Hey told me, that her did a second run and got it
---
I thought that group started with a "door stop" too?
---
I how that halfling ranger will reach level 7 one day. After all this time he deserves it.
---
 Not a mage, but you get bombs and grenades and Arcanite Dragonling and Battlechickens which can help with your damage.
---
Mage is most played class atm. So you telling me you seeing many mage groups? No WAY
---
52 now. I just dont want to get stuck in the pack pretty much. I have heard how hard it is to quest with everyone in the same zone.

Ahhhh I just realized everyone that's complaining about the classic system is thinking of retail!
---
Unless ur a warlock and it’s agi/Stam :)
---
It would only be hypocritical is I did not do my thing my way . I know how to play games. My complaint is in finding like minded people often enough to not feel like I constantly have to play on easy mode to stick with the herd.
---
That zoom edit legit made me nauseous.
---
need pc specs at minimum
---
You found Ollie from Family Guy
---
Set graphics to recommended.  Enable v-sync.  Go into advanced settings and set the foreground FPS slider to the same FPS as the refresh on your monitor.  See if that helps.
---
I didn't downvote you...?
---
Non-rogues will never get the joke.
---
Love these
---
35g an hour from vendors is on the lucky end, 45g doesn't happen
---
and its not reasonable to say you get 6-12g from 3 stacks of solid stone
---
I don’t have anywhere near that time to put in atm but thank you for your input my man :)
---
Judge of Righteousness, Hammer of Justice, BoP. And if you have DPS who can put two brain cells together and wait three seconds for Consecration, aggro isn't generally an issue.
---
Apparently hating DPS Shamans is a thing
---
Or have you considered that maybe the overwhelming majority of DPS are smooth-brained bullshit operators who will face pull half the dungeon with their AOE or pet or frostbolt and then blame the tank for not picking it all up?
---
Isn't it so that removing layers will reduce the amount of people that can concurrently play on a server?
---
This is exactly what I do, if i join a group i start making 4 stacks water per non mage mana user and generally a couple stacks of food for the wars and rogues to minimize downtime
---
Just trying to have a friendly conversation with the guy.
---
It's all just min-maxing and completely disregards the player's enjoyment of the game.
---
Propably hard for a druid without sap/blind.
---
Orc see red. Orc smash hard. Orc job done.
---
errrrrrrrrrrrrr no.
---
How old are you?...
---
youre a mad man.
---
You're damn right its me!
---
There are still casting, neutral mobs walking, waterfall and UI sounds....
---
Dick move indeed. Every single one you make seems to be one.
---
You can definitely do the coffer key run as a druid, and I think this is quite possible as a druid too, however I would strongly advise having decent gear if you're a druid. 
---
You'd have to find some way to cc and burst down the pyromancer. Also I don't have a druid at that high enough level, but I do have a friend that also does guides that I could possibly talk into doing a druid PoV!
---
First Aid is a must. Especially as a Mage you'll have countless times you can Poly/Nova/First Aid and survive where you'd otherwise die.
---
Cooking is wonderful. That stam/spirit buff is great - and is nice to share with group members in a dungeon for tough bosses.
---
Fishing helps you to level Cooking, but I mostly train it for farming Deviate Delights.
---
They had way better temper and patience than I would have that's for sure.
---
Yes. In b4 you get flamed for those keybindings though
---
Frankly I love druid healers/tanks in my dungeons and have a lot harder time finding healers/tanks than mages but YMMV, especially at level 60 (Just hit 50 recently)
---
You sound like a mage that's just mad people are calling mage players out for their stupid shit.
---
He wasnt cheating. He was so high up that he wasn't "on the boat" and when the boat left the world he got held up on the invisible wall

He was trying to be edgy, bless him.
---
Really enjoying my time on Blaumeux (bluh-moo - roughly), before Blizzard kneecapped the census addons it was showing right around 50A/50H exactly.
---
Imagine not understanding sarcasm
---
I woulda said... because im level 13 and ive got 5 anilities and auto attack lol
---
Everyone keeps talking about these AOE mages, and here I am hitting crits every other cast. I can kill a mob same level as me in 10-15 seconds every time.
---
Sure you might be able to kill 5 or 6 mobs at once, but if one gets out of the pack and your Cold Snap isn't up, and they tear through the ice barrier.... you're dead. Or using a potion.
---
Don't mind me tho.
---
The oom faster than everyone else gets me. Rank 4 healing touch is the most Mana efficient heal in the game.
---
Congrats for this insane job! I'm currently 4550/6000 friendly, hopefully getting this beauty at the end of october!
---
I use an mmo mouse so I can click all my buttons on my mouse. I use all default keybinds with a few letter keybinds like R, F, T, and so on.
---
I’ve been reading that +(specific) damage adds more damage per point than  +all spell damage. Not sure how legit that is and not sure how big the effect is.
---
You either spend all your time making water or drinking it.
---
You wouldnt be able to open it if I wasnt there, therefore its ALL MINE HAHWHAH
---
I have no problem with stuff like that. Sounds fun.
---
Can’t agree more, DPS doesn’t pull unless asked by the tank. I had a Warlock causally pulling extra mobs after I got the first pack. After first few times, I stopped pulling them off him In the end.
---
Guild mates were giving him gold so he could purchase Arcanite Bars from other people (the last material he needs to make the Sulfuron Hammer).  Holy shit aren't you the dumbest little shit in the area.  By the way, when Asmongold equipped Sulfuras it was sick.  Also, you may have felt defeated by me pointing out your stupidity 2 sentences ago, and felt redeemed in the last sentence.  Tough luck retard.  Octobers got the mace.  So shit on Asmon all you want for accepting guildmate gold to get the last materials to get Octobers his hammer.
---
30 seconds and you formulate an opinion that you share online.  God, are you stupid.
---
I provide the mats and tip 1g?
---
Sometimes they dont even want tips aslong as they can skill up enchant for free?
---
Hell sometimes i will even pay 3g for a port because i need to get there asapm
---
You know your response is just going to be “wait for the cool down to be over” right?
---
Yeah I've had mages tell me "open trade" when I ask for water, then they cancel after I don't put any money in the trade.  Like buddy, I'm tanking your dungeon, it costs me most of my mana bar to buff the group with MotW, you want this this to go quick and smooth or you want to start off with everyone thinking you're a greedy asshole and not really wanting you in the run anymore?  DPS are a dime a dozen, I can replace you instantly with someone who has a better attitude.
---
Same on Herod NA. I will see like 7-8 Horde for every 1 Alli I see in contested zones, and they almost ALWAYS zerg me. I wish I rolled a rogue so I could avoid these fucks or pick them off one by one.
---
More often than not!
---
Not sure that's true. If they don't say it until you ared in the dungeon, it's not ninjalooting, if they don't say it until your at the boss, the GM I spoke to said it's not ninja looting, it's only ninja looting if they do it without saying anything beforehand. So you can be an enhance shammy running for Mograines Might, once you get to the mograine fight, then a druid tells you you can't roll on it(even though the druid is the healer), they ML, it drops, druid gets it, you're fucked. Basically ran a dungeon for no reason if that was what you were after. Try contacting a GM with this scenario see what they say.
---
petition to enable some dance moves while moving like this, looks smooth as fuck.
---
CSI is in for some work.
---
Only thing that matter in a dungeon is overall damage done. Dps is only good for dick waving in raids.
---
Don't worry about trinkets. There are barely any until you get closer to max level and most of them are super situational. I'm at 53 hunter and I only have 3 trinkets so far. Carrot on a stick (3% mount speed), luffa (removes one bleed every 15 minutes?), and the ST trinket (applies a weak DoT in an aoe around you every 15 minutes?). All 3 of them don't make much of a difference.
---
We hit one button for 2-3 hours in MC.
---
I'm currently level 51 and through all of my dungeon rolls no one has ever needed on any item just to get the gold. I feel like there's an understanding between most players because of what you just described. Actually needing the items comes before needing the gold at all times and if everyone needs on it, that ruins it. I mean it's out of respect and common sense. I'd like to get an upgraded cloth piece for my character without a warrior needing on it because its worth a lot - so you do the same to them. Just make sure to equip the item in case they inspect you to see if you ninja'd it.
---
Registered Nurses and several other larger guilds moved yesterday.
---
I have no experience with that but I believe there is a keybind to target friendly players (just like tab does for enemies). Maybe you can bind it to a button and port it to the controller. 
---
That's just a small thought, hope you make it work!
---
An addon that shows all the dungeon maps and boss/item locations. Atlas hasn't been working for me :/
---
As a tank every time I “slip past a mob” I stand at the critical point(closest point to the mob) looking back at the group, when all have past me we move on, but if they pull I’m ready to spike a Grenade for aggro.
---
Sure, but if the item drops and someone who wasn't the one who called dibs on it still rolls on it, because he genuinely needs it too, is he considered a ninja?
---
And/or is it safe to assume the party leader will toggle master looter once he reaches the boss that drops whatever he wants?
---
Oh that makes sense then why no one will help you, all other members of your faction are stuck ganking people 8 lvls lower than them in STV
---
I'd rather not. I've been doing SM and ZF runs in AoE groups for a while and any AoE spots are camped with other mages.
---
Hell yeah! Hope you get it. I’d definitely play shaman if I rolled horde. I mained an enhancement shaman in retail since wrath
---
wrist issues
---
It's too late. Y'all are already generalized.
---
Agreed. Everyone needs gold, BoE's = gold, end of story.
---
Sorry for the late reply. But this website is super helpful. I got it to work. Thank you so much! And it has a ton of templates to choose from.
---
Are there any alliance quests for SM?
---
Three dps, three targets. That means each dps gets a target to see who can kill theirs first right? 
---
Seriously though, I marked a skull and X. If you can sheep the condom do so. I can hold threat on three or four mobs if you single target.
---
There are a few pretty big drawbacks, I mean the popularity, the boredom of beating the game, the burden of being so awesome, the envy of emo-mages (warlocks), the ease of topping meters so effortlessly, the superior AoE, the Superior CC, Everyone loving you for ports, everyone loving you for water, the sadness you feel when you kite around a enemy faction warrior who is doing his best but can't even touch you. I mean look at him, poor little fella with his big ole axe, he doesnt have a chance.
---
No...no it’s not.
---
*Raider I.O
---
None, apparently
---
Oh yeah. I don't miss nades at all. Would mess up my rotation at this point and would only use when trying to Disengage. Blackout is the only stun I need. 6% and I'm still seeing it proc once or twice a fight. Nuts.
---
Its a pvp server, 1 purpuse ;)
---
I think whwn honer system arrives it gets for fun, when u have honer kills, and dishonerable vs greys ;)
---
Raid shot of me last night:
---
https://i.redd.it/0a3t19on5o001.jpg
---
Yeah I can handle healing two persons but it’s when a mob turns on you too that it starts getting messy.
---
I rolled against 3 people on my first Mara run @ 48 and got it :D
---
I usually open with “‘Cuse me can I talk to you for a minute” and for a follow up I’ve tried a bunch of different combos of the below stuff:
---
“How are you”
---
“What’s your number”
---
“Can I have your number”
---
“So can I have it”
---
“Can I have it”
---
“Can I please receive the secret code that will intelephonically pass me through to you”
---
“Come on”
---
“Can I”
---
And I just don’t know what else to do.
---
Your example is terrible. Druids only have a battle res, so you’re only going to need it in a group setting. There won’t be fandoms looking for a Druid for a battle red. If you’re trying to charge people for a battle rez during a dungeon or raid then you’re terrible.
---
Puggle will automatically aggregate LFG / LFM messages into a list with links to whisper the poster. It can auto-expire them when they get too old and it will show how old the message is
---
You can set it to push chat/audio cues when it hits a match
---
stop fapping so much
---
Surprisingly, no, though I wasnt there for too long, maybe 15 minutes. I have a feeling if I return I probably will get one though.
---
The classic will die down for sure, but most of people will have enjoid their time and will go on,
---
 retail players will still be stuck in the retail experience
---
The biggest problem with classic is the amount of people min maxing and occasionally having people with retail mentality in your group.
---
Warlocks and Hunters mostly
---
Enchanting won't make you gold until you get non-trainer enchants, either from world drops, raid drops, or reputation grinds. Depending on your server, you're going to be competing with everyone else who is also trying to level up enchanting by doing cheaper bracer enchants with dust.
---
Crusader, +spellpower, +healing power, maybe Fiery are good ones to pick up later.
---
I agree.  I do not think the balance needs to be 50-50.  60-40 should be the maximum disparity though if you ask me.  Beyond that there really just isn't a chance for the outnumbered faction.
---
Blizzard has the tools... queues and transfers... if they can make these faction specific then they can balance out server pops.
---
I’m sure there’s a way to edit classic LFG to add keywords.
---
Right, I guess if you're doing an entire run (esp. as a tank) and only need one thing from that place, it's better to let them know earlier rather than later.
---
Seriously. Can someone create a portal to his server??
---
so good
---
Put it in a seperate window.
---
That reminds me, impeachment proceedings might start today.
---
Targetting &gt; Target Nearest Friendly
---
You'll have to hit it multiple times to get players further away than the nearest, but it should be workable.
---
Good on you for looking this up.  Yeah that's some solid info there.
---
Wouldn’t that be a cast sequence ?
---
Yes, and the appropriate Pavlovian response:
---
"Grats!"
---
lol fuck the alliance, they deserve to get wrecked, maybe try a pve server you whiny alliance. imagine unironically rolling an ally...hahah
---
And every party I'm in wants 2 mages :/
---
Jesus, do you have HoJ already too?!
---
Everything seems to be in order here.
---
Oh, It’s been said, and it’s true.
---
What you so mad for? At which stage did I say paladins weren't allowed to roll on cloth?
---
How much time do you have to play?
---
I was the first warrior to hit lv 60 on horde side and I ranked spell cleave from lv 11-55. The team comp isn’t specific to 4 mages and a healer. I’d say a spell cleave is two aoe casters at min. I remember pulling the stair event on my warrior. Just mount up, stand on the bottom near the stairs and strafe from the left side then right, it pulls everything then run up the stairs. As the mages blizzard in behind you.
---
I just got around to joining classic, and I'm somewhat between warrior and rogue as my main (both are lvl 6-7 still in Tirisfal Glades).  I mained warrior in live since just before TBC launch so for me it's nostalgia/familiarity, but I yearn for rogue as novelty, pvp server fun, being a pain in the alliance's backside (no pun intended), and because I made him a jawless undead named Seenmyjaw
---
If I decided to main rogue, I'm unsure if I should level swords or daggers [per wowhead.](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-leveling-classic-wow#leveling-swords)
---
I'm not an expert rogue in retail..never have actually gotten one to max level of an expansion, mostly just dabbled.  Personally I want to make the most use of striking from stealth and putting mobs and enemy players down in a dirt nap quick and stealth back out.
---
Looking for input from the "L33T" rogues. TY!
---
This x100, don’t use this addon. I don’t know how many times I had to look up quest codes and back track multiple chain quests just to catch up with the addon
---
&gt;At this point I generally just feel like I'm there to tank the bosses and just let people do whatever the hell they want
---
this is the only way to keep sane as a tank if you play with pugs
---
Just tossed it in AutoCAD and drew some circles.  Looks like the cast bar is centered on the screen, and the FPS counter uses the middle of 'FPS:' as the anchor, which is centered.
---
I assume thats because you wouldnt want the FPS counter to be moving every time it updated (various numbers are different width, so 0 FPS would be much narrower than 122.8, for example).  
---
I should probably get back to work now. @_@
---
Put your faith in the light!
---
Yes, I feel that he was complaining about the lack of dynamics though? I mean, that's just what classic is, there just isn't much dynamic in PVE content in general, especially solo. The difference in solo is basically the amount of downtime a class has in grinding.
---
&gt; I asked if it was really acceptable to roll on BoE for gold and they said yeah it is common. Well is it really? 
---
Its common. I expect it as the default loot agreement unless something different is discussed before hand. Sucks for your given situation but by the same rules if a different BoE dropped you would have been in your rights to roll on it, sell it, and bought that BoE gun you were hoping for.
---
There are quite a few arguments on the topic, but the big take away should be if you are ever unsure it never hurts to have a quick chat at the beginning of the run to cover the loot rules/expectations.
---
You're 100% right.  Asmon did NOT get the legendary.  He should feel ZERO satisfaction that his guild got the first legendary on the server.  Thank you for pointing out this intelligent and critically thought-out point.
---
It's yes
---
Atlas  &amp; atlasloot both currently work. On the twitch app.
---
I mean... standard raid spec is arcane / frost but yeah.
---
I keep those melee weapon skills maxed out or close to it. Even unarmed from fighting Defias Looters is up there.  Defense always maxed by the time I'm half a bubble into my latest level thanks to trolls in STV and roadside gorillas.
---
You copy and pasted this reply like a dozen times in this thread.... do you really feel that was needed?
---
Darry, why you starin' at bear testicles all day?
---
Maybe just wants to lay on couch and play on his 4k tv? Why not ..
---
Or hes disabled and cant use keyboard and mouse.
---
@op  maybe you can open a tickend and ask if there is an option to change some settings / scripta to be anble to use like ctrl+ tab as combi to target friendly nearby players
---
I mean, thats basically how running BRD works.  You start with lvl 49s and end with a 59.
---
Is there any way to farm Freezing Bands?
---
I play on Bloodsail Buccaneers, RP server communities have always been better IMO as people like to focus on the social aspect of the game. I have done some PvP and can agree arcane isn't the best for that but I can hold my own. Tbh I'm enjoying classic, so idk if I'll make it to 60 before the next phase and content. But can see why frost is optimal.
---
But you have no way of knowing if the Rogue is lying about how high his lockpicking skill is. Some people legitimately wait until 60 before leveling it up. 
---
Not saying I condone what the OP is saying.
---
I honestly don't try to be on the front side of groups... I usually will just be questing around somewhere and have the LFG tab up and will wait until a group only needs one more or maybe two more tops before I will attempt to join the group - this saves a lot of time standing around the instance like you were doing.
---
I hear you on the getting removed part... do you have a guild?  You might want to try and find a nice sized guild on your server as that makes finding groups much easier and you can somewhat leave the PUG life behind.  
---
The MT was nice enough to offer - you should have taken him/her up on that.
---
Farm it. It ALWAYS drops eventually, kill another 400 when you get the time. Those things are expensive and you’d much rather have a mount first
---
there is an addon called Fishing buddy. it doesn’t disable all sounds but automatically turn off music and make catching sounds louder when you equip the Fishing Pole
---
I have both factions pumpkin, but thank you for the shitty advice
---
I can see you don’t understand the nuance here so let me explain it to you. 
---
No, you wouldn’t need on a BoP to vendor it. That’s because 
---
A) vendor price is next to nothing compared to market value of a BoE epic and 
---
B) that BoP upgrade can only be dropped from that dungeon and that boss. Therefore whoever needs that item would have to farm this dungeon more and get lucky to get that upgrade. You wouldn’t roll need on a BoP to vendor something for a measly 5g and make another person spend hours farming for it. 
---
However with a BoE epic everyone is on an even playing field. That epic is worth let’s say 100g. That’s the same 100g to everyone. That item can be bought after x amount of hours farming, by anyone in the group. 
---
If you’re automatically entitled to the 100g BoE just because you’d equip it, that’s saying your time is all of the sudden more valuable than my time. 
---
Suddenly this piece of gear isn’t worth 5g to me and a big upgrade to you, it’s worth 100g. Flat. Across the board, same for everyone. 
---
You’re taking away x hours worth of gold farming from me, when you could just as easily farm for x amount of hours and buy that BoE from the AH, rather than feel entitled to take that 100g straight out of a party members pocket.
---
Abandoning, or disappearing? Can you call it back, or does it say "you don't have a pet?"
---
Two very different issues, your pet should not be abandoning you if you are keeping it at full happiness, but they just disappear all the time from flight paths/being idle. You can call it back at no cost or penalty though.
---
I think this is a pretty inconsequential decision that you should make for yourself.
---
CHOCOLATE?
---
Drinking.
---
Spamming one spell in PvE.
---
So squishy one big melee crit can kill you.
---
Spell pushback.
---
Annoying posts generalizing all mages based on one bad experience you had with a mage once.
---
Mobs being immune or at least highly resistant to your main damage type, which really no other class has to deal with.
---
More drinking.
---
Agreed. Tanking is about leading, you have to become comfortable as a leader. Pull slow or fast, its up to you. At the end of the day you can ditch and find a new group no problem.
---
&gt;like why would i care what you play? 
---
As someone who's not on the mage-hate-train but lowkey empathises with their plight - there was a good week where spellcleave was dominant enough that it made a non-insignificant impact on other players looking to DPS. I personally didn't suffer much but I got unlucky a couple of times and I can imagine the chance that someone gets unlucky frequently enough to get tilted.
---
Uhh they definitely are insensitive.
---
New guild rogue passed first. My buddy who I’ve raided mythic with in retail since legion tho waited til last second and asked if it was really that good for tanks, he was tempted lol but passed anyway even tho I told him no hard feelings if he rolled 
---
Man, nerve racking 60seconds or so tho as he was silently making up his mind
---
&lt;sarcasm&gt;Sounds like you just suck at tanking. Everyone knows RNG isn't a thing. Sides, don't you have taunt that can be used for each mob in the pull? Git gud nub.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
---
i tried turning vsync on as well and that also crashes my game. almost any change i make to the advanced settings makes my game crash except the fps sliders
---
Just beautiful
---
This is going to sound condescending but it's not meant to.
---
Do you have or are you aware of the ability "call pet"? Is it possible your pet is just dismissed? 
---
Also when you use the feed pet ability make sure your pet gets the buff that looks the same as the spell. This means his loyalty is increasing. Be sure to let the buff run until the little face turns green. It only works outside of combat, so you should wait a bit, you may have to feed him twice. You are prolly feeding him and going right into attack mode thus losing the buff.
---
I hope that helps!
---
Did I make a mistake by playing on a normal server with a medium population? I'm worried that as the game dies down there won't be people to have a full blown adventure with in a few month. Do you know if they will do transfers eventually?
---
I feel ya buddy. Although I'm mainly healer, I am more afraid of pulls when I'm regenerating mana.
---
Guides are very, very good for maximizing your leveling time. If you would rather find your own way, then that's your call.
---
&gt;after only 1 particular item only to lose on it to the tank
---
What if I'm only running that dungeon for that one particular item as well?
---
That's why I said 1 run I roll need. Several runs he gets it first, because I 
---
&gt;may want to do something else instead.
---
As looking for another healer just to go through the same thing again.
---
The general point im making is there is an item we both need and we both have a fair roll on it (if we don't agree to farm it for both of us).
---
This is awesome, I don't think I even knew how to take a screenshot back in the day. Any of the ones I took probably were on accident lol
---
Dont think names need to be redacted in an anonymous game. They just rolled..

I really miss UO. My first MMO love! Is it up somewhere today?

We might be. I synced it up last night qith my vinyl version of lauras theme and it felt really eerie with the similarities lol. Might have some composers in common or just influenced.
---
Newsflash bub - The biggest reason people are playing classic is not because the graphics are shittier
---
100% this.
---
You dont need a shield or prot spec to tank while leveling. I wish more warriors knew this
---
Maybe a clean reinstall of your graphics drivers could help?
---
Yeah I just remove the keybindings and change them since my fingers can’t really reach past 5 comfortably. So instead of 6, it would be shift + 1. Alt is self cast by default but most mage spells can’t be cast on yourself, so you can use alt variations as well. You can keybind the abilities above your main spell bar in your interface too. Whatever works for you though, there is no one best way of doing it
---
Unless you have a dedicated dungeon running group, don't go Resto for leveling.  If you want to do end game healing, respec at 60.  You can heal until the high 40s/low 50s just fine in healing gear spec'd as feral.
---
How is that even a name? It's a short phrase.

The Bay of Storms, Azshara needs 330 fishing to cast.

Ok that makes sense!

Ehh I'd argue the dps of every class with a mana bar is dependent on an item that they have to restock every couple hours.

&gt;Multiboxing is not possible when playing on the same account

not with that attitude
---
Sorry I should’ve mentioned that I’m playing as mage. Is there one for them that you know of?

That advertising alone would make me buy one and I'm a hunter!
---
There will be less selection of "hardcore" raiding/pvp guilds. However on RPPVP servers you will find hardcore pvp guilds. You will still find raiding guilds on either server type. RP servers tend to have friendlier players.
---
Female Orcs are definitely feminine.
---
Spoiler: The dmg auras hitting max 4 other people arent as good dmg at all as an actual dps.
---
Enhancement has the most going for it but the small boost to agi/str/ap they get again is not worth their poor dps.
---
Give it time, I think the culture will start swinging back in the other direction sooner or later as a natural backlash, or a healthy correction if you prefer. There's a middle ground in there somewhere but i think many would agree we are no where near it right now.
---
It's okay for a dps to kite one mob but they should really say what they're doing instead of letting the tank pull all their aggro'd mobs around trying to peel off that one. Some people are just fuckin morons though and assume the tank is supposed to know this when in reality it looks like they're running away. Also it's less rage gen for a warrior so really not ideal.
---
Jesus...

SAMPLE TEXT
---
What class are you? For enhancement shamans and pallis is pretty good. Not too sure about warriors.
---
For fluff reasons, because I'm RPing a Goblin Slayer type mercenary on Bloodsail Buccaneers who brings lowbie guildies and anyone with coin through dangerous dungeons to score a few pieces of early loot and get the layout for real runs with level appropriate friends.
---
For other reasons, because I'm sometimes sick of killing trolls, pirates and other STV wildlife and a Dwarf has to take out his frustrations on unsuspecting lowbie elites in dungeons he has no business being in.
---
Warrior. I compared it with other weapons and couldn’t find much better weapons until p5?
---
Druid as well
---
Maybe they just despawn bc flights Aster and you need to re summon them ? Idk
---
Nobody really knows answers to these questions. if you are afraid, roll a new character on a high pop server.
---
On three separate characters, the minimum time it took me was 45 minutes, probably about 150-200 whelps. Sounds like you got lucky!
---
Me horde strong. Me crush puny human skull and zevhra hoof. Troll tusk is nothing. me very strong. Me will only bring pile of goo to creepy undead man. Me want his gold, undead man will be happy with my goo, or he will be goo. Big moo will come for you.

If u ret its bis for you, if war very good for pvp, if shaman unbreakable ho!

A mundane reply for an even more mundane comment. I dont see the problem
---
Where does he play- is it still up somewhere?? I thought it died long ago.
---
You can't deny AoE grinding mages not being obnoxious and entitled.
---
Some what off topic but when you first get a new pet and are working on increasing its loyalty, is it a waste to continue to feed him if his happiness is already green? I've always heard you have to feed new pets a lot when you first get them but I wasn't sure if over feeding is a thing?
---
Same. Stopped playing retail in 2013 after I got bored of cata and thought I would never play again.  Once I heard about classic my curiosity got the better of me, and here I am three weeks later all obsessed with WoW again :)
---
can't match the mass pulls you can get with eye + PW:S, also you're down 1 mage AOE DPS by even bringing a warrior along.  It's fine and will work smoothly, it's just way slower.
---
Combat Swords is objectively the most efficient at leveling, and it doesn’t hurt that a lot of good quest rewards are more likely swords than daggers. However, I am personally leveling with daggers and a hybrid subtlety focused spec. The playstyle and faster stealth speed are just way more fun for me, and you’ll still be effective in dungeons and group content with good backstabs.
---
I am starting to regret picking druid as my alt.  None of the weapons I get matter.  None of the weapons or items I get show on my character.  There so far does not seem to be any (many) skills to use as a bear tank.  Just seems skarm way over hyped what a bear tank would be doing while leveling or in dungeons at the 50-60 range.
---
I think its fine for warrior and macestun is fun. Not sure tho. I would craft it to fullfil a childhood dream lol
---
I like how you assume this when the title fairly clearly points out he was alone. If you actually play this game you'd realize very few mages would turn down an opportunity to bully a solo warrior. I would continue to flame you for insulting my friend but I think the rest of the commentors did a fine job. 😁
---
Love it! I've been tanking for dungeons and got an opportunity to heal last night that went well since the warrior managed threat super well. Haven't had any major issues like everyone seemingly claimed I would
---
It's about as classic as classic can get.
---
Keep your pet happy. I know you say you feed them "all the time" but you need to keep their happiness up so their loyalty goes up. The frequency you feed them doesn't mean anything by itself, especially not with a vague measurement like "all the time", you need to pay attention to the happiness indicator.
---
It doesn't help that mages seem to have a large percentage of FOTM players.
---
I'm at work and service here is nonexistent for my phone so I can't check wowhead, but off the top of my head the rewards are either a 2h axe, a 1h sword for melee, an offhand with int/spirit/maybe another stat, and a 4th reward that I cannot recall. As a mage though I wouldn't expect to get into a cath group until 37-38 considering last boss is level 42.
---
It's just a circlejerk at this point.
---
You can level up to 60 without saying a single word to anyone.
---
Currently there are no paid character transfers available... I too would love the service.
---
For me as a tank it's a lot of other little things.  Like dps pulling mobs while I'm waiting for the healer to get some Mana or when the healer says brb and they still pull.  Also when dps that can heal won't after healer is afk for a minute.  Its not so bad when it's one thing by itself but when it's all in the same run the problems compound and wipes take a lot more time than going just a little bit slower.
---
I almost gave up on my Tauren Druid around 15 but I'm glad I stuck with it. I'm 24 now, hoping to ding 25 tonight 
---
I'm just really bad about rolling alts.
---
Melee cleave is great but a lot harder for the tank to deal with, also harder because when you pull aggro you are right there to get hit by the adds, but when ranged takes aggro they have time from when the add starts leaving the pack running out to ranged, and even more added time when the add is slowed by blizzard or something. If you have a group of really geared great people I think melee cleave would be faster, mostly because you arnt waiting as much for mana either.
---
I have one macroed to sap, and then also a pickpocket on my bar-- that way I never forget!
---
It's very easy to with weakauras.
---
ArkInventory is fantastic for bags. It lets you designate sections for certain categories of item, and will restack for you as well as sell your junk items automatically.

Thank you for your response, I was looking for some insight on how either scale as you go on. Good to know Moonglow scales well and my playstyle is more suited to Casting than off-tanking so I'll probably end up doing that.

Next step for blizzard is to make target scan to friendly players an option like it is for enemies
---
What add on is that?
---
Why not warriors? Seems good
---
You can change your keybinds in the settings. I have wand bound to "E" on an action bar and it works nicely.
---
&gt; Tanks basically have to focus 100% of the time
---
Lost me here. 
---
Tanking is autopilot half the time, and it's completely straightforward when not.
---
Hunters have mana too dont forget. And we dont have much mana until we get into raid gear. Hunters  auto attacks cost gold, hard to compare that to needing water...
---
No, but we've got a dude in my guild who sounds exactly like Norm McDonald.  I call him Yaphit.
---
Loothound ? Alot of assumption there.
---
Even worse comment
---
True. Get your guild to help! I'm sure if an eye drops some loans will go out
---
Yeah...what's your point lol? I told him he has to respec at 60. Which is correct. You can't run arcane /fire in MC.
---
Ok, might be a setting from the chat addon you re using?
---
If it was changed to be normal in 1.8, then it will be normal in 1.12....its not like 1.8 means '1.80', 1.12 is 4 patches later than 1.8
---
Must have gotten lucky. All normal mobs have dynamic spawns depending on the number of players in the area, but named mobs do not and have a 5-10 min spawn timer.
---
 The legal status of derivative fan made art in America may be tricky due to the vagaries of the United States Copyright Act. Generally, the right to reproduce and display pieces of artwork is controlled by the original author or artist under 17 U.S.C. § 106. Fan art using settings and characters from a previously created work could be considered a derivative work, which would place control of the copyright with the owner of that original work. Display and distribution of fan art that would be considered a derivative work would be unlawful.
---
However, American copyright law allows for the production, display and distribution of derivative works if they fall under a fair use exemption, 17 U.S.C. § 107. A court would look at all relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether a particular use qualifies as fair use; a multi-pronged rubric for this decision involves evaluating the amount and substantiality of the original appropriated, the transformative nature of the derivative work, whether the derivative work was done for educational or noncommercial use, and the economic effect that the derivative work imposes on the copyright holder's ability to make and exploit their own derivative works. None of these factors is alone dispositive.
---
American courts also typically grant broad protection to parody, and some fan art may fall into this category
---
That's a plausible scenario
---
No one can skin until you loot right? So maybe don’t loot until you are sure no one is around? Idk. With same factions options are limited.

OFFENSE TAKEN FOR NO REASON!!!!

Do flamestrike crit/arcane explo crit build i did it from 20 to 28 it was fun.

I've been in a guild when there was a new member, the member conned an officer to promote them to where they could access the guild bank, the person stole things, and we reported it to Blizzard and the things were replaced. This was back in Cata, but I don't think their policies have changed. I'm not pulling anything out of my ass, here. It's highly situational, is what I'm saying, so implying that you're shit out of luck is not accurate.
---
what  i miss the most is the freezing trap effects.  it used to be a solid white patch of snow on the ground, now its just some fog on the air...
---
We'll seei guess
---
I figured the “I’ll throw up a sheep” gave it away that I’m a mage. 
---
Maybe I needed to scream it at the beginning so a dumb ass warrior can pick up on it
---
I mean, that analogy doesn't really work one-to-one here. I don't know much about Judo, but I assume there is training that you do that isn't sparring or fighting at all times, right? On a PvP server, it's *just* fighting - there is no training or anything. "Red is dead," is the default mindset of that group of players, and that's exactly what you want on a PvP server. Ideally, you would have a 50-50 split in a two faction server, but that tends to never be the case.
---
You had every option to *not* sign up for a PvP server, but you still knowingly did it. It absolutely is not a secret that PvP servers have... PvP... And that it gets in the way of progression, and can be frustrating, and can even kill your desire to play for the day/week/month. I mean, come on man, this game is how old and you're still surprised that people want to PvP on a PvP server?
---
This is coming from someone who is brand new to WoW and signed up on a PvP server with a 45-55 split Alliance vs. Horde (Thunderfury), and is on the Alliance side. We get freaking hammered and it can be annoying, but I've had some fantastic PvP moments come out of it already. Try to pull a group together with guildies, or your faction, and try to fight back. 
---
This next bit is a bit harsh, and I don't intend it as such, but it needs to be said - If you don't want to fight back, or PvP when it's inconvenient for you, then you shouldn't be on a PvP server. I want to reiterate that I'm not trying to talk down to you, I totally get where you are coming from.
---
With all of that said, I believe there are still free transfers from some servers, so you may have the option to move off without losing any progression. For the sake of your enjoyment, I highly recommend taking advantage of that feature.
---
Peace, and good luck out there!
---
Remember when you could play bejeweled on flight paths? I want that.
---
&gt;and I really wanted to use 1 hand.
---
Hmm mmm... cause reasons eh?
---
WWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
---
Let's make this simple. You're saying the monetary value supercedes the item's impact for someone.
---
That's just not a judgment that you're entitled to make. You're also saying that I'm suggesting that equipping the item is terrible value long term, which also isn't true. If it's an upgrade for someone, then it's an upgrade. You can't measure the impact that item will have on their play or their judgement of the game. It's not selfish for them to roll need so that they can use it. 
---
The point that I'm making is that it's selfish to roll need on something that you want to sell when you're not playing with a regular group. If the result of the item (equip or sale) only benefits the individual that receives it, priority should go to someone who can use it, because that's how the loot system is designed.
---
Just because you think the gold will benefit you more than the item will benefit a potential user doesn't mean you should roll need.
---
The only argument here is whether or not it's selfish to roll Need on something that you can't use in order to sell it. Your strawman arguments sound nice but you're avoiding the point of the discourse: is it selfish to roll need on something you only want to sell? Yes. All you care about is your own gain in that event. And that's fine man, play how you want, but that doesn't make it not selfish.
---
You have made the judgment call that your monetary gain is more important than someone else's upgrade. That's selfish by definition. If you want to roll need even though you're only rolling for greed, that's on you. There's just no way you can make the argument that prioritizing your own monetary gain over anyone else's achievements isn't an act of selfishness.
---
I’ve seen so many threads like this from so many different accounts and here’s my take. 
---
Most people get impatient if the run is going slow. Please mark targets. 
---
Designate a icon for polymorph and that mage is responsible for that target. If he gains agro on that target he tanks it. If he dies he dies.
---
While your healer is drinking at 20% do not stop pulling. Just pull accordingly. But never ever stop unless everyone is low. If you are level appropriate than you and 3 others can kill 2 elites without heals. 
---
Bandage and eat yourself as well. Do rely on heals 100% of the time. This saves time and pushes the pace. 
---
As a warr specifically this applies to you. Do not try and gain agro on every single mob if you lose it unless it’s attacking heals. Sunder skull and focus X and other mark with double sunders then go back and mix in shouts as this creates a ton of initial threat. After skill dies even if skull loses threat it won’t matter as the rest of the pull should be glued on u. Skull should get melted by 4 dps without u so do not turn you’re back on a pack unless you absolutely have to. 
---
Battle shout. Leave you’re group unbuffed by this when you know there’s a large pack that agro would be tough on. Pull with gun and when everything leashes shout and then demo shout. This should give you so much time to gain threat as the battle shout is buffing 5 people and then demo debugging x amount. 
---
You will never have agro on all the mobs unless none of you’re attacks miss and or get parried etc. so it’s ok to lose threat on one or so. With hunters other melee mages classes can easily tank a mob until they die or you get to it. 
---
That’s my .02$. I have a warr tank and haven’t experienced half this mess people complain about. 
---
If the mage wants to aoe and dies for it then he dies. He will learn but you continue on.
---
Alt+Z
---
Nah, I figure most of them don't have jobs.
---
Charge on pull don't bloodthirst
---
Ty ill copy paste later if you dont mind
---
I never said I had to win every roll although I said it would be nice.
---
Better avoid parties like that
---
Im experiencing A LOT from both sides of the Retail vs Classic argument. Last night was great example of team work and world pvp. Questing in badlands with 1 guildy and 3 randoms, we are very into getting the quests done, no one leaves until everyone gets done and I love when I experience that. We ended up fighting some horde for like 30 mins, (they had a lvl60, bastards!) The whole thing smelled of community and thats how Wow should be. 
---
However, there are also those LEET toxic folks who obviously never played Wow vanilla and complain about everything, dont group up, like cleaving everything in the dungeon and wiping then asking "where are my heals at?", or not engaging in world pvp when a fellow is in need of help.
---
MANY WHELPS! NAOW..... HANDLE IT!!!
---
Sorry you responded within 4 minutes and I saw it a minute later, and it was downvoted and your response was hostile. It was a logical assumption.
---
That is incredibly false, melee is useless to huntards not hunters. If your not keeping your melee stats up to max your doing it wrong. Melee is really good especially if you dual wield. Melee crits uselly hit harder then ranged crits too unless your full MM. trading raptor strike is a must. If you don’t have your highest rank raptor strike somewhere on you ain’t playing a hunter. But keep spreading this false information I love when people try and charge me in PvP only to realize my dual axes are just as powerful as my gun.
---
Lmao
---
Actually, it does. If 99% of the game exists only at level 120, then that means 1-119 are so easy as to be irrelevant. So you have fourteen YEARS’ worth of content that can be facerolled. By my calculation, that’s 99.16% of character levels that are “not hard” compared to the less than 1% where yu actually get hard content. And even at 120, you can do dailies, WQs, LFR, LFD, or even normal raids and dungeons which you admit are also “not hard.”
---
In fact, the only content you seem to think is challenging enough to merit the title is heroic raids and mythic dungeons. While I think most people agree that those are significantly harder than anything available in Classic, let’s be generous and say 20% of the endgame population will ever actually do them.
---
20% of .83% is about .21% of the game actually being hard. Wow. So difficult. Much challenge.

no need for lures for STV fishing tourney, once your skill is high enough (225) the fish never get away, and anything higher doesn't increase your chance to catch desirable fish, and doesn't increase accuracy of cast.
---
.. so uselesss.
---
You rez after a pull, you heal during a pull.  Outside of combat, using mana is not important, because you can drink it back.  I can’t believe that’s something that has to be explained lol.
---
I love mods slapping things as low effort because the reaction threads in new are a great read.
---
From what I recall retail removed that requirement and it just said “the pages are blank”
---
That’s the way it is on my server (Ashkandi, alliance). Raw greater sage fish=1g-1.25g a stack, sage fish delight 45s-75s a stack
---
The honor sets will be released with the honor system starting in phase 2. Battleground rep rewards will come with the battlegrounds in phases 3 &amp; 4.
---
You're in luck!  Having a Lesser Magic Wand at level 5 is both efficient and fun!
---
Spooker Brand wands and bags, where you're never in the wrong thread.
---
Then use other unitframes?  LTP frames are default, it just allows you to move them.
---
most likely
---
Ok so a realm transfer? Got it
---
Good mages will mostly look for aoe group, because its faster. Because of the line with aggro i assume you are not part of aoe farming. That means you are inviting bad mages. Case closed.
---
That's exactly how it feels lol. Everything seriously takes half a second to register on frames, drives me crazy.
---
yeah back in vanilla if you needed it, you had to equip it...greed was for selling.
---
Especially when you consider how much silk flooded literally every server thanks to spam SM runs.  Silk and silk bags are on the AH for literally less than they vendor for, of course people give them away without a second thought.
---
What lvl and class to solo Sfk?
---
Imagine posing the question "who cares about this stream" in a comment ON THIS SAME THREAD........... and at the same time..... commenting FOURTEEN TIMES on the thread,  Find a hobby, friend.
---
My elbows in this particular case. Some days I don't feel anything, other days they are killing me when they touch my chair's arm
---
&gt; Frost is the only viable spec in MC right now.
---
That part is wrong - standard raid spec is arcane.  Only one winter frost spec is needed per raid group.
---
I played two mages (one Horde one Alliance) in TBC/WOTLK so not exactly the same, but got both to 60 and just couldn't go further.  Just boring tbh.  Yea, they are fast levelers, but it feels like all my time is drinking. Topping the meters is cool though.
---
Just as a counterpoint I'm currently leveling in 50s averaging under 5 hr/level

Add-ons can no longer /who so census is dead.

 Pug groups happen all the time. There's no issue at all finding pug groups.  Wtf you talking about lol
---
I'm currently levelling a shaman as enhancement but am interested in healing in later dungeons. Is it worth respeccing when I get chain heal, or leaving it until my 50's?
---
The red dragon (Andrestrasz?) is there in retail, but not in classic (I checked :( )
---
&gt;/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"

ahh thank you i actually really missed this from retail
---
&gt; I just use crit holy shock, run in full rank conscencrate, mana seal judge, mana seal, smacks while popping off my lower rank concentrations with maxed righteous fury.
---
"just"
---
i did a couple mara runs with this paladin tank on old blanchy the other day who did not have consecrate. i dont know how he did it but he was holding aggro like a motherfucker, and was not drinking all that much. was probably the cleanest runs of any instance i have seen since classic started.
---
hes either on to something new or has mad hax.
---
I really need some Alliance on my server to post the Alliance only recipes in the GZ AH. I'd pay a decent markup for them
---
Nah, smack in the middle of Badlands are two large rock bluffs.  You do loose circles around them.  It’s well south of Uldaman.
---
BRAZILIAN
---
They already have one. Its actually pretty nice. It scans all the channels like Trade/General/Lookingforgroup and lists all the people looking for groups. Its pretty handy. Ive been using it.
---
1.12 is after 1.8
---
Are you an enhancement player? How much hit % do you need to not miss against a raid boss ?
---
Sometimes I join these kind of group out of curiosity.
---
It ends up 4 hours later with a bunch of regrets.
---
No you cant, because it often does not register, based on my experience running through the barrens a few weeks ago.
---
FWIW, if people ask kindly (e.g., "So sorry to bother you man, I know you probably get asked all the time - but could I possibly bum some water off you please?"), I never mind conjuring some up for them.  And if you throw in any tip at all, I consider the whole exchange to have been a positive experience.
---
Protip:  If you want to tip, always tip money.  Don't tip in random items, because that takes up inventory space and the dude may not have the space to spare.  I often have to delete my conjured food and mana gem to make room for the stacks of water I'm making for you lol.
---
It works at 0, upon the charge. Arms spec allows me to stance dance and retain rage.
---
Certainly.
---
knuckle dragging mongloid imo. admit it's a great game in dire need of a light balance patch.
---
WHY IS MOONKIN LITERALLY WORTHLESS? WHY IS ENHANCE HALF A TANK TREE? WHY DONT PALADIN TANKS HAVE A TAUNT?
---
Me and my friend have plans to go back for the anniversary, and maybe prepatch if it's good. And then maybe 9
---
0 if that's good. But all our long term hopes are on an eventual classic+
---
20 seconds is an extremely significant amount of time in a pull. Not to mention it is trivial for a decent Hunter to retrap.
---
Every sub is a huge circlejerk because that's how reddit is designed.
---
I was referring to me calling *you* stupid. Not the idea. It wasn’t a personal attack so put your little victim card back in the deck.
---
I've always seen it as 
---
Blue bop mail warrior helm drops
---
Hunter needs it to sell to vender for 54silver.
---
That's a ninja
---
Purple BoE drops that anyone can sell for 450g? 
---
I'm assuming everyone is going to need on it anyway. But I try to do dungeons with friends or Guildies to limit any awkwardness
---
Thanks for this, I have thought about levelling one of them up on a normal or RP server, but again it comes back down to that thing of thinking I should be playing my 'main' one, and I'm always going to be thinking of my main as being the one on the RPPVP server.
---
Nice. Tag.
---
I love golddkp. Either you get gear or you make some decent gold over the run.
---
Who can open locked chests In the group? The Rouge? He gets to loot it, It’s not rocket science.
---
Please for the love of God don't turn this sub in to a low effort circlejerk post  gallery.
---
Just go a melee mage build, use it to your advantage.
---
Really, all you can do is mark the targets, explain to your party you need time to build rage on the target before they unleash hell and inevitable draw aggro, and then you should be good to go.
---
From what I understand, a lot of it has to do with how willing your party is to let you do your job properly.  Sometimes people don’t have the patience to let you build threat/rage and you end up chasing mobs, sometimes they give you the few seconds necessary and it makes your job a lot easier. 
---
Communicating that to them if it becomes an issue is often helpful.
---
For sure, if the healer is ending every fight at 10% mana then they shouldn't be dropping heals on you assuming you aren't taking damage outside of tapping.
---
Lower lvls won’t be able to do it unless they are rogue or Druid. Otherwise you are taking high 50s and 60s who won’t aggro
---
Got my SO into Classic and it’s been great. I’m still hoping BC and Wrath come out as options.
---
Get to 35 and make an army of transmuters
---
PVE combat in classic is like a beach resort vacation. If anything you just need mild situational awareness to succeed. 
---
I came back to WoW after a stint in Final Fantasy 14 where most class rotations are no less than 8-10 buttons/casts and screwing one up can destroy your DPS for the fight. It really put WoW's combat in perspective.
---
I have had this happen multiple times too =(
---
Looks familiar, just missing that bastard of a best friend dancing on top of you
---
Not that i know of, i would reccomend looking at guidelime for other guides
---
It will be easier once you get to SM and can just farm SM and also level your pet in there as well.
---
There are two occurrences of the owls: one during the NE starting zone and then later on around level 50.
---
My favorite is the people who walk right behind you. Especially casters who are lower level and aggro everything...
---
NPC Scan for rares
---
I thought I was going to click and see someone else who just had one character around level 30. Nope, haha.
---
GABAGOOL!
---
Exhibit A: /r/classicwowplus
---
It might have more to do with the alliance spending more time running around ganking lowbie areas than actually accomplishing anything.  For a server that's 70/30, half the time most 40 and lower areas and infested with people wasting time glitch killing 30's and below.
---
Tier 1 is, for the most part, hot garbage in a lot of cases...
---
What does this have to do with retail lol
---
I think it's a little early for judgement of current classic wow society. Many of the players are still in this "gotta hit 60" mentality.
---
Literally this, run in on mount, Corruption, CoA, and siphon life each target, then drain life and clear cast, and don't lose any health.
---
I remember maces being pretty broken in PvP in burning crusade. Since you don't have much cc as a warrior
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't believe pickpocketing is considered looting? It works on every mob that can be pickpocketed.
---
I have auto-loot turned on though.
---
You do not need to spec Resto to heal dungeons until you are 60. Most talents do not change your abilities by themselves, they operate in unity. A level 20 with 11 talent points isnt going to be much different than another one without any into resto.
---
Let me guess, thalnos?
---
Then just keep scrolling, like the rest of us have to. Pretty simple solution
---
what macros are these exactly lol
---
Speaking as a single target ice mage, I apologize for the asshats that share my class. We are not all idiots. Personally, I find aoe grinding horribly boring, so I went for single target dps. Not nearly as many of these dungeon wipe issues that way.
---
Aw, Altoholic isnt around?  I was actually going to look for that last night and then forgot.
---
I can keep track of my inventory pretty well thanks to Bagnon, but professions and stuff like that are annoying.
---
What river do you mean? Because I can't see a river in North West arathi
---
i know ;D I can maybe had a wrong target (maybe turtle?) when i was trying this,i dunno. Or it was really not a desease :O Anyway,I mean I surely tried to dispel(cure) it, but failed ;(
---
 There's only two things I hate in this world. People who are intolerant of other people's cultures and the Dutch
---
Yeah I mean go for it.  I PvP nearly exclusively at max level.   I love a good fight, but beating on people that can't possibly provide a good fight isn't really PvP.  If there is zero or near zero risk, then there is no exhilaration, no adrenaline rush.  Just seems like beating a puppy because technically real life can be PvP and the puppy was nearby.

True but that's 1 item. It adds up pretty fast over 7-8 bosses. I'd be pretty if I left MC  30-40 gold richer.
---
Guild leaders are all about fair loot systems until they lose a roll on their bis piece.
---
Are you kidding? Classic wow plus is primarily people who liked vanilla and want WoW to go a different direction than retail did, lmao. Good try
---
I agree. macestun is op since you dont have a lot of cc as a warrior. And 3 seconds free dmg is nice

There are two other existing auction add-ons that aren't TSM though.

Only problem with TB is no engineer.

You're sleeping on how powerful to hit bonuses are
---
Until you're capped out on to hit its the highest DpS boosting Stat out there for any class
---
I love reddit
---
Right, you definitely don't just up and do that without some sort of agreement or ready check.  Mages shouldn't even sheep pull without everyone being aware and prepared.
---
What level can I start doing SM lib and armory runs? Just hit 32 last night and I already hate SMGY.
---
This is the key thing. Being polite. People lack etiquette and only want to roll need on everything that is considered BiS. 
---
As a priest I will not roll on BiS spell damage gear for locks and mages because I only intend to heal and my spec is to heal. If I want that stuff, I’ll need it when everyone else greeds. 
---
I could roll need and say “well I need it for when I shadow spec” but to me that’s just being greedy. 
---
Palys get to roll on tank and healing, warriors get to roll on tank/DPS. Other classes are limited to only DPS. The biggest thing here is politeness and etiquette. But seeing how my original classic experience was and how retail people are blinded by BiS charts, we shouldn’t be surprised. 
---
This is why I try to run with people who aren’t greedy or stay guild only in dungeons.
---
This has nothing to do with retail you monkey. Vanilla was just like this. There are 40 people and only a couple of pieces drop per boss. Lots of people are going to feel left out. Loot drops improved drastically in every version or WoW after vanilla.
---
I didn't level Rogue in Vanilla but the calculators online give it 30% per level, which is in line with the current talent tree. I guess it's possible there's a set bonus somewhere that boosts it to 100% but I wouldn't know.
---
WoW has very modest requirements. Any rig with a decent video card will do very nicely.
---
Ah, but the point I'm trying to make is that you just assumed the way I feel. How can we expect to judge and police the way people feel?
---
Simply referencing something that exists in real life is not insensitive. Taurens and trolls and their cultures and voices that are based on real life things are not explicitly evil or bad or made fun of, just as the humans and dwarves and their cultures and voices that are based on real life things are not explicitly evil or bad or made fun of.
---
I need to re-examine Feralas as it's been quite a few levels since I checked it out. Good call on the ST quest run too, I'll check that out.
---
A GEAR SWITCH ADD ON THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!
---
Like outfitter. but for vanilla
---
NO AWARD ONLY UPVOTE
---
I only like to play with tanks for Onyxia and MC raids - outside of that, I usually don’t invite any tanks for clears because they try to slow everything down. 
---
It’s just not worth the trouble in inviting them
---
Haha, well, that's what makes it fun. I find that basically a good dungeon run is one where this more or less works out, and the DPS pitch in with their own utilities--the rogue will stun mobs running for DPS, the shamans will offtank(and i doubt a healer will pull from them), the mages will hopefully frost nova responsibly, the hunters will pull, kite, then feign, the druids will stay in orgrimmar...
---
A true rogue right here.
---
Bruh it's a hair style.  Just pick one, we're not talking life or death here. I'd rather not have them waste even a second of development time because someone is upset about choosing the wrong hair.
---
Autoignore no but it does bother me.
---
Imagine playing an MMO with the easiest PvE in the game for PvE, where some classes rotations are quite literally 1 button, most are completely macroable to 1 button since the API allows /castsequence.
---
Imagine getting gear just to do 5 more DPS to a boss you've already killed without it. On repeat. For 6 months. Until another phase comes out.
---
Dungeon Maps/ room maps in general.
---
This is the most annoying part of coming back to WoW after more than a decade - so many people telling others that because they arent using cookie cutter builds or powergaming/rushing to max level that theyre playing the game 'wrong'.
---
I love levelling, questing, interacting and helping others even when I dont really get anything out of it. If I wanted to just do loot runs and powerlevel, I'd go play Diablo. There's barely any endgame content as it is, what the hell are people rushing to?
---
On my mage if you're in my group you get free water.  If you ask me for water out in the world you will not get water without a tip.
---
I mean, what is the XP/h? Is it really that OP?
---
My biggest gripe with retail players is that they bring that elitist mentality over. They are always complaining about this and that. The most uttered phrase ive heard is "TOO SLOW!".
---
I haven't checked out Felwood yet so I'll look over them tonight. Thanks!
---
Apparently they're working on porting it.
---
Yeah so you have to rely on the combat log
---
I mean, the name would check out in that case, but even a dumb golden retriever knows the 4 wings of SM
---
basically your right... when it comes to 1on1 grinding mages kinda suck.
---
but, when you add in the fact the mage can easily aoe 15+ mobs once they are 40 with a mount then all of the eating/drinking becomes less annoying.
---
as a mage i can kill a single target in bout 3-5 seconds if i use nova and shatter em (i do bout 1400 dmg on a double crit shatter atm @ 49). but i use sometimes half of my mana (im +70 dmg with 4300 mana) and a 20 second cooldown.
---
skip ahead to me fighting 10+ mobs and ill fully oom but i just killed 5x the mobs i would of killed previously for the same mana and i can easily double that if the zone allows it.
---
the only downside is if anyone of the mobs resists either of the 2 nova's you have to do then you have too cold snap, and if you dont have cold snap up you have to reset entirely or risk dying.
---
luckily as a mage you have all of the tools so getting away is fairly easy. but still a bummer ;(
---
id rather play a hunter or a feral druid and not aoe, but ive always played a frost mage so i started up as one not knowing how op they were and how id prolly spend most of my time aoeing (and now im too deep to just reroll lol). but i adapted to it and here i am :P
---
Genre is irrelevant for easter eggs which is what is being discussed in this topic.
---
Lern2Spell (automatically swaps out your abilities in the hotbar with higher ranked ones when you learn them) doesn't seem to work in classic so it technically doesn't exist
---
You’re poutin' like your little sister took your last Oreo.
---
And not a traditional Oreo, no, a limited edition Oreo, or seasonal Oreo they're gonna take off the shelf for another year.
---
Hey, Barts, did a little gnome rogue take your last Halloween Oreo? You didn't get a chance to say goodbye to that delicious orange frosting? What about you, Yorkie? Huh? Did a little night elf Druid take your last Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Oreo?
---
Really appreciate you sharing these ideas! I actually don't RP that much (a little bit here and there) but I like being on the RP servers as it makes the world feel a bit more real and alive. I'll have a think about setting myself some sort of 'rule' to get myself out of the starting areas at least...the problem is sticking to it :D
---
But you will be a better healer in 5mans!
---
What level are you, what level is your pet, what loyalty is your pet, what kind of pets keep disappearing, what are you feeding it, etc?
---
Are you making sure they actually eat the food, and you're feeding it the right thing? Is it dying a ton without you feeding? Are you going AFK for hours?
---
If you’re in a position where you’ve decided that you aren’t going to heal someone to ‘teach them a lesson,’ you should just leave. The mage decided to teach you a lesson by kicking you, and you’re both being incredibly petty here. 
---
Venting about someone in your deadmines group is not a productive course of action. You’re going to run into hundreds of bad players before you hit 60. 
---
Grow up, git good, move on.
---
Slower DPS should never be a thing lol
---
Has anyone seen the Epic caster dagger drop off her during your runs for the ring?
---
That’s when you realize your playing with retail mythic+ babies trying to speed run through the dungeon grabbing a ton of mobs. Or it can be by accident sometimes or someone is legit new to the game. 
---
Hell I’ve made a couple mistakes as dps already. Once I forgot to dismiss my pet before jumping even though I made sure to have pet taunt off and it be on passive. I remember one group I was in was a bunch of mid lvl 20’s speed running through DM for some items and quests, me being lvl 26 hunter. Before the goblin boss, someone aggroed a ton of goblins and they started making those tanky robot pets. One of the party members was asking why I was attacking the goblins and not the robots and I was like because if we kill the goblins they will stop making the robots. The guy was kinda a dick, not to me but in general. 
---
As far as my warrior tanking has been going, so far not to bad but completely see tanking from a better perspective. Watching taunts resist, sunders and mocking blows miss. It’s best when your in a group that understands how warrior tanks work. I think everyone should try tanking a dungeon as a warrior at least once to understand. Not that it’s mandatory but would make dungeons go a lot smoother.
---
Yes I wanna know too, give a link
---
It’s one thing to use growl for a good reason. Its another to just leave it on all the time because you’re too lazy to turn it off.
---
If the pally is healing the dungeon, they have a right to roll on healer gear.
---
Any healer wouldve likely rolled on to hatever item it was, as all healers end up in cloth. If it were a priest healer OP wouldn't be upset, and still would've lost the piece. 
---
I get it, it does suck, but it's vanilla itemization.
---
Here is a piece of advice for allies on heavily horde dominated servers:
---
Just transfer off if you get the chance.
---
If you don't, then you will wish you had when phase 2 hits and you'll be camped everywhere at every moment.
---
They're all scarlet monastery, scarlet monastery graveyard, scarlet monastery library, scarlet monastery cathedral, and scarlet monastery armoury. They're technically seperate dungeons but in the same building.
---
ok making sure. cause im used to the "client" being the window that opens before the actual game. thought there may be some settings there you may have meant. but even after the fresh install it only runs smooth whn the fps cap is maxed and not at 75 which is strange but whatever i guess lol
---
Below 60 I would say no. Unless you're a twink or rolling in cash, equipping a BOE epic while leveling is a dumb idea even if it was all yours.
---
&gt; When can I tank efficiently with a shield instead of uding 2h?
---
level 18 if your group works with you.
---
&gt;most likely
---
I don't know how much more obvious it needs to be lol
---
If you want to understand mage attitude, go watch "The Legacy of the mage" by Preach.
---
it's pretty shit, sword spec is better
---
by bwl you can get ashkandi which is better and doesnt cost a million gold to craft
---
Could someone briefly guide me on when to specific pets as a warlock?
---
Currently: I use imp in dungeons. I switch between enigma and succubus I'm PvE, usually using succubus because enigma doesn't hold aggro anymore (lv25). I'm affliction moving towards demonology for leveling.
---
*\*kicks trash can\**
---
IT'S FUCKING EMBARRASSING!!!
---
Who knew this game had Alt-Righters in it?
---
Warrior 38
---
Care to show me how it's bannable? I'm not saying bypass the GCD, just a macro that takes it into account before continuing.
---
If you love pvp rogues in classic are fun.
---
Two mobs vs. a whole genre of mobs like Elementals... Priest/warlocks will survive I'm sure.
---
flag carrier
---
Normally when I see this chain of comments, it was a child that logged into their parents account. Or an axe murderer stalker that broke and entered and dropped hints.
---
Best character in all of Warcraft lore.
---
Love his entire story.
---
actually its the opposite, going slow makes the tanks job harder if you have antsy dps. if the mage is still drinking and the rogue still waiting for energy and cooldowns when the warrior starts the pull, he won't have anyone contesting his aggro in the first seconds and its smooth sailing from there. if hes waiting for everyone to be at 100% so they can unleash their full dps rage hes just making it harder for himself.
---
Gnomes are free, I get to keep all 3 fingers though
---
Your mistake was leveling enchanting. Every point earned is money down the drain. You should have just gotten enough skill to disenchant all the items you come across then sold the mats for profit. Or you should have just gotten a gathering skill. I took tailoring / skinning and had about 5 more gold than I needed for my mount when I dinged 40. 
---
So no it's not too late but it probably isn't worth the time to reskill. I would just stop working on your professions and farm cloth/greens to sell. You might not have your mount at 40 but that's okay.
---
Yeah this is the only acceptable comment
---
Hello, currently I'm leveling as a Shaman and just hit 31. I've capped out Flurry, and grabbed Parry for some extra defense. I figured that would cover me for leveling purposed DPS wise. My question is, I ultimately want to heal instead of DPS. Should I start going down Resto now, or flesh out the rest of Enhancement? If I continue down the Enhancement talents, when is a good time to respec? 50? 60? Thanks.
---
If you don't keep water/food on you at all times as almost every class, your dps is going to suffer. Food and water cost gold. How is that incomparable? Just because hunters also need arrows doesn't mean it's hard to compare. Every classes dps cost money.
---
since the need/greed system is already "not classic", they should go ahead and implement this feature as well
---
no, it's not acceptable, but people are gonna do it anyway - Everyone should roll need on BOEs.  That's how it was done in 2005, that's how we'll do it in 2019.
---
Haha yeah definitely not afraid to experiment a bit, it just seemed to me like I might be missing something that leads everyone to avoiding this talent (e.g. getting a cookie-cutter spell that makes the reduction irrelevant).
---
True but I’d rather rock an owl as they get claw which I prefer over bite.
---
if you have any hope of keeping DPS as feral its required
---
If I see a warrior going on a tanking power trip. I start pulling mobs just to mess with him. : )
---
Thanks, I’m 53 now with about 125g left after buying the pattern (for 65). This will be my first 60 in classic/vanilla so I’ll look up how to farm all the gold and essences.
---
Gold is split among the party. You want to loot it over someone who will equip it then you pay everyone 1/5 of the value once you win.
---
Just keep it till BG gets released. Youll get way more than that as a twink BIS. People dont have the gold yet. Hang on to it
---
Level 58 ENH and i've basically just started plopping a totem down, pulling with flame shock and alt tabbing while i auto attack shit at this point, still goes about as fast as using stormstrike with half the mana investment
---
My guild currently has 2 40 man groups and will probably end up forming a 3rd here soon.. absolutely insane
---
Which class can get that tiger mount??
---
shout out name and shame in LFG channel
---
Honestly, don't go overboard with "BiS" items; there's usually a few that are absolutely S-tier and kinda irreplaceable (Truefaith for priests, archmage for mages, HoJ for warr, etc.) or very easy to get and so should be in everyone's kit. But for instance, I'm not going to drop 100g on cassandra's grace when I can get a green +healing helm with the same +healing and miss out on 6 spirit and a couple int. It's just not that big of a deal.
---
If you can get hit cap, have solid +agi, +crit, and +AP; and not bust your balls doing it, I say go for it. The difference between *actual* BiS and next-best BiS is honestly fairly minor for a lot of classes.
---
It is way too late. Skeram has Reign and Rise, which are incredibly hardcore guilds (min/max, alt requirements, etc) akin to top mythic guilds on retail. Then you have a few other guilds, who aren't even posting active recruitment on the discord or in-game. You have a few smaller raiding guilds remaining with ~100 discord members but likely only 30-40 actual guild members since they are constantly pugging 10+ spots for MC and ony clears. 
---
Skeram is dead for regular alliance players, such as myself, who followed a large portion of players who don't want an imbalance skewed towards a 70:30 ratio, and only getting worse. 
---
If blizzard stopped alliance transfers off skeram now and only let horde leave, why would they? Skeram has almost no queue times. Even if I have a 1500 person queue it's only 20 minutes or so, and that's peak. Why would horde transfer off and lose their faction dominance?
---
Both reign and rise are going to camp world boss spawns when they are enabled, and they'll be fighting the entire horde population if they already haven't set up some sort of deal with the horde/between themselves. 
---
Skeram will constantly lose alliance players until it's an incredibly dead server, and it already was for the most part. No one in my guild could farm for materials, and most dungeon/raid entrances were camped by horde.
---
I spent most of my Mana on him and that was just on the patrols. Van Cleef requires a lot of mana, the battle drags on a bit too much, and I was afraid we'd wipe (as they had donde thrice) if I focused on him too much.
---
One that I do and see a lot of is arena/anger/golem runs, and emp/princess
---
I would have said sorry and then spent half hour giving ports for free.
---
When god was handing out brains he thought he said trains and said "nah I'll catch the next one"
---
After the waterfall there are the patrolling hydras, the lowbie can hug a wall there and get credit for the kill and can receive master loot. The level requirement for the quest is 45. I did this over the weekend, paid a guy 25g, took him 4 kills at around 12 minutes a run.
---
All they need to do is wait a bit! Let me get some damn rage lol.
---
A lot of those people don't even know what they're crying about. They blame it on Classic.
---
Yeah, if I put time in I’m sure I’ll have a spot. I’m partial to the dungeons and 10-mans myself. Can’t wait for Dire Maul, Zul-G ain’t really my bad baby.
---
As a rogue, I had this incredibly stupid helmet from levels 40-60. Was so glad when I got rid of it.
---
Thank you sir
---
Thanks a lot
---
Yeah,not discounting I could be remembering wrong either. Its been a while.
---
He said per bar of xp.  That is 200 per level.  Could very easily mean 800-1000 situps in a session.
---
Already done it, no missing out here.
---
Not true, I just did it the other day. The level 60 just has two kill one hydra, two to be careful.
---
You good bro.
---
My IRL friends who started with me wanted to play alliance so my dumbass played with them and I'm too deep to re-roll.
---
I’m a bad feral Druid tank (lvl 28). Anyone wanna rip into me, project or give advice?
---
Except ww requires berserker stance which will tax your healers in an AoE pull and Thunderclap actually mitigates 10% incoming damage from each target.  
---
Thunderclap also generates additional threat while whirlwind only generates threat based on normal weapon damage.
---
Playing a gnome this time around I find people are either so nice and leave me be, or they go really out of their way to kill me. It’s fun
---
r/NotMyJob
---
You are the problem then, A tanks job is to CONTROL the encounter. You purposely making sure that doesn't happen shows you are not only selfish but a shit player.
---
a run this weekend, I had a tank whisper me early on in the run "why are you taking so long to fight" (I am in stealth and open with either cheap shot or garrot depending on the fight)..... about half way through the dungeon I got a "my bad man, appreciate you giving me some time"
---
Unless you spending too much heals on a cloth creates a wipe, which had happened thrice and was the reason why the previous healer left*
---
Not exactly because there are five rolls.
---
*laughs in rank 1 rez for 400 mana*
---
Best get to eating.
---
I rerolled for 15g, never too late.
---
found the zoomer
---
Clique and whatever unit frames suit your fancy. I use Grid because it's very minimal but customizable and that's what I'm used to, but it works with any unit frame afaik.
---
Most raids aren't that advanced. 
---
If I can get a shadow priest instead of a 10th rogue, I will.
---
about 1day 14h average with maybe 3-4h of afking
---
You get credit for the kill quest so you can advertise the thrash blade as well to convince warriors and roues
---
woosh
---
"this game that came out 15 years ago has characters that are similar to other things that I've experienced since! How unoriginal!"
---
Wat
---
Full disclosure, I'm a mage. I don't mind as long as you give individuals the opportunity to prove we know what threat is &lt;3
---
It sure is.  Still a better deal than playing a paladin in classic.
---
Thank you. Was about to say prettymuch the same thing.
---
So, how easy is strafe kiting with the melee leeway that now exists? Is it still useful? 
---
I feel like I can’t get the appropriate distance/movement to make use of the technique, you know?
---
u jelly?
---
No image.
---
Idk this looks like a language barrier maybe. Almost all swedes speak English fluently.
---
Interesting. I’ll try that thanks.
---
Cooking and fishing can make you gold and they can be leveled up with each other making the process nearly free. Event fish sell well and bonus stat food is helpful for raids etc.
---
“Not possible if you do it correctly” resists are thing a bud. You can’t kite it back to the group to nova because it just resisted your nova lol. But yes dealing with a stray isn’t as hard with CoC kite and waiting till the second nova.
---
A mage in the average strat live run has to:  
---
\- AoE
---
\- frostbolt
---
\- sheep
---
\- LoS 
---
\- kite
---
\-not frostnova ontop of the healer
---
If you aren't familiar with your class other than pressing blizzard and frostnova, yes, you do need some skill as a mage.
---
I would LOVE this. The buff showing up on your buff bar seems super delayed or buggy. Sometimes I need to walk within 10yards of my totem to see the buff pop back up.
---
I'm fascinated how every single person seems so obsessed with random internet lists with supposed "best in slot" stuff.
---
Hell, people don't even question it. The different lists out there are *very* inconsistent, with even different items.
---
I'm pretty convinced someone could do a list with, partwise, really shitty items that look cool, have it rank well on Google and watch people starting to demand out-of-control AH-prices for really bad items, and even watch people buying and wearing them.
---
Haha my theory is that everyone is at least a little sleep deprived and just cranky
---
Don't turn in quests from 58 onward. Grind in dungeons to get pre-bis and level that way, and then your quest XP will be converted into gold. You'll be just fine at 60, even having bought the pattern instead of farming it.
---
Really specify a budget or your going to get a 9900K and 2080ti recommendation.
---
Processor is the least of your worries I think. I have a 9600k running at 4.7 and WoW classic uses like 5%. The newest Ryzen chips are really competitive and priced better than Intel's offerings.
---
I have a RTX 2060 Super and easily get 60fps with the maxest of maxed settings at like 50% utilization, about 100-110 fps if I take off V-sync.
---
Back to AMD again, their new 5700 line GPUs beat the Intel versions at the same price point.
---
Dual cards is kind of dead tech, don't bother thinking about that.
---
A Ryzen 3600 and a RX 5700, would blow the doors off classic and also let you play newer AAA games at 1080 60fps.
---
&gt; more often than not it's the tanks who try to make their jobs super easy by going excruciatingly slow. 
---
If you don't wait the healers cry about mana. If you do wait people cry that you're going slow. Either way someone isn't happy.
---
&gt; The difference between a good tank and a bad tank is not him being able to hold threat. A monkey could hold threat in a single target situation. 
---
Yea, and outside of the boss encounters, it's almost never a single target.
---
Holding threat on multiple targets is fairly painless if the DPS focus fire, which they never do.
---
I would say any boe epic world drop is fair game personally
---
Yeah its probably the only thing I miss from current WoW (I'm assuming, I haven't actually played retail in a while but I know classes are way more fleshed out than classic).  I have played FFXIV off and on as well, great game but none of my friends have gotten into it so I just resub every few months.
---
you realise you can get over 300 lockpicking?
---
**Tank:** "Alright, please follow the marks, remember I need threat-"  
---
**Healer:** *pre-HoTs the tank and begins casting greater heal on pull*  
---
**Hunter:** *Aimed Shot Arcane Shot Multishot*  
---
**Mage:** *PoM Pyro into Blizzard*
---
I ran a bunch of SM cathedral with a Paladin tank - only time I was lucky enough to do that. DPS was me and a mage and a hunter or rogue - don't recall which. 
---
It was great. Stuff died so fast, and he usually pulled 2-3 packs at once. Never any aggro problems.
---
He made it clear that we should wait to DPS until the first consecration was down and ready, and we did. Sure occasional aggro happened but nothing bad.
---
Try mikes scrolling combat text for clsssic
---
Unless you’re a mage I was getting brd groups around 51.
---
Is it actually worth it?
---
I got whitemanw chat the 2nd run lol
---
The talent system wasn't revamped until MoP
---
second this grid/clique is my OG for all healing.
---
Yes. I was running to SM and came across the body but could not honor the request.
---
Sorry I don’t mean to be elitist in that statement at all! I’ve never done the pve classic content as I started in BC and its a blast. But it will be short. I’m just here to run around with my friends and fight ally. Progression is easy! Which means it’s not elitist or competitive it’s just a means to some gear to use to fight more ally!
---
The joke is that you would need to already know all the secrets to open it. If it actually could be opened, then it wouldn’t be a joke. You are whooshing hard, dude.
---
Scratch that, I relaunched and it's all working now.
---
Orc Rogue, it’s what I rolled. With effort you can reach warrior dps, and in the cases where it’s not PvE you have so much survivability compared to a warrior.
---
PVP happened on a PVP server. And that's what it is regardless if it's even or if it's fun.
---
Considering I've gotten [Atiesh](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/dragonblight/hakot) and multiple Gladiator titles, I'd venture to say I actually know exactly what I'm talking about when it comes to doing "what the group wants".
---
I don't even know how you managed to infer that I don't know how to sheep targets.
---
Says the kid that's already used the strawman. Look, everyone is clearly picking on you for your crying about a natural part of the game. If it riles you up so much that you've been ganked and that people don't want to hear your whining, I think you need to take a break from the game, or reddit, or both.
---
I'm with you 100% on the "people are just as snarky/bratty" in both retail and classic, but classic does tend to be a bit more chatty in group content. If I had to guess why, I'd say a combination of:
---
1. Small to medium chance you've grouped with these people before/will group with them again due to closed communities.
---
2. Slower pace to gameplay, less ARPG piano playing or dance dance revolution mechanics, giving you more time to stop and type in a PUG.
---
3. People who self selected into Classic for its much ballyhooed social aspects tend to be chattier.
---
I keep seeing people quoting census data for server pop and faction distribution, but no one ever posts sources. All I can find are those addon LUA /who trawling pages that rely on player input, which needless to say can be a bit skewed. Is there a reliable complete census that people are looking at, and if so where can I find it?
---
This'll probably get removed due to low effort.
---
But yeah, mages right?
---
Could very easily spiral into harassment
---
twitch has them all
---
&gt; I asked the guy if he would mind if I took it, he said "nah need money"
---
Studf like this is why I'm glad either myself or my friend are nearly always party lead. If someone were to pull this in my group, that would be a definite party kick + block.
---
Well yes, but it clearly wasn't obvious to the previous poster because they said they were surprised. That's whats confusing me.
---
Yea I haven’t rushed and I’m only 48. Tons of people seem to be around the ZF grind levels.
---
I think they broke add-on's that do /who. But you can still just do /who yourself.
---
It is a 2-way street yes but with friends I don't mean like friend friends if you get what I mean. I was just expecting to have found some people to play with by now by interacting with them through questing and leveling or in a guild. Becoming actual friends does take time yes. Being helpful within your guild is of course a good way to get people to like you and ask you to help them with things and you'll be invited in groups easier like that. So in that you're definitely right.
---
&gt; Example: My rogue is getting hit by mobs that she cheapshots. Those two things should never be happening at the same time.
---
Another fun one for you: When casting feign death successfully (so not one of the many bugs) mobs will often hit you up to ~0.8 sec later and then reset afterwards
---
People still play destiny??
---
Spirit troll warriors! The new rage.
---
An add on that allows you to draw on the map
---
Mages are the new hunters lol.
---
after a period the loot disappears and the corpse can be skinned, shortly after, maybe 30-60sec, the corpse despawns.
---
No point going dw if all of your off hand hits are going to miss. You will be seeing a lot of off hand misses with only 3% hit. You do you though :)
---
This please

Hi Firebabby, Zanbon here. Great question! I wouldn't say this is lucrative, because people tend to lose interest when I tell them they need to actually pay me before I do anything, but I tend to get a LOT of positive reactions from people via whispers when I post this (thanks for the laugh, etc). 
---
Mostly I think it helps people blow off some steam, because I ask them WHY they want me to send messages to someone and let them vent to me in whispers about whatever BS they're upset about.
---
What am I missing here? There’s nothing that’s telling me this isn’t just a screenshot of someone’s priest. Thanks for a real screen cap at least :)
---
This is closer than many answers but not exactly right. For one thing, one minus the probability of no matching rolls includes the probability of more than two participants rolling the same number. Also, for the scenario in the screenshot to occur, the two players matching numbers must be the winning roll.
---
Are you the Warlock I was with on Sunday?
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Suffering
---
Level 18??!?
---
Auughhhh ugghh
---
Cool thanks! Enhancement Sham, hitting 50 shortly after I leave work. Might try some tonight
---
Hunters will always be hunters, that is written in stone. Mages have their issues now, but hunters are still legendarily bad.
---
Druids are monster tanks and completely viable if not optimal for all content presently in the game outside of a couple of bosses in Molten Core. Most of the people wandering in to ask questions about which class to roll will likely spend next to no time raiding, so it's unfortunate how hard the raid meta from 3-6 months down the road when BWL and AQ40 are out gets trotted in as the only "viable" way to roll a character.
---
PvP was a bit slower paced in TBC (still bursty, but slower), which made Mace Stun good - Also Arena existed, so the need to get stuns/cc's on healers was very real.
---
In Vanilla warriors can 2-3 shot priests.
---
Do you play FFIXV by chance? Lol.
---
Look at this book. It's a good book. A book of how to warrior. Be aware if you want to warrior good you actually should read this book. If you don't like reading go play a simpler class... like mage? Ironic huh?
---
That's what I was getting at, runs that stop at golem, and ones that go all the way.  There's also arena runs that don't go past the arena, just resetting, those are the hard exp runs as everything after that is tougher for less exp.
---
Q! Change A and D to strafe so you don't need to key turn. My main rotation is QER
---
Idk what your saying but rogue out dps warrior with no problem when i do wc dungeon i am always number 1 in dps beat mages and warriors no problem
---
What is the point of Blue Shaman?
---
I used to use a spell alert addon called WitchHunt. It was around from Vanilla-&gt;BC officially. It would show on screen, color coded, what offensive spells any enemy around you was casting, and any auras they gained. I used it extensively in PVP and also found it immensely beneficial while out questing as well.
---
The original addon:  [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8513-WitchHunt.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8513-WitchHunt.html) 
---
I've tried to replicate this in WeakAuras, but I think I'm just going to have to build it in Lua from the ground up.
---
Yea honestly it would be pretty cool to make like a flask / cooking / enchant area where people could come and get all their shit done pre raid / dungeon. Might be settin up my own Mr Papadapalas Foods n Flasks shop in SW/Ironforge...

---
No ofc not.
---
&gt; the sadness you feel when you kite around a enemy faction warrior who is doing his best but can't even touch you. I mean look at him, poor little fella with his big ole axe, he doesnt have a chance.
---
Sadness is a funny name for a raging erection.
---
Your lie in april is amazing. Havent heard of the other but if they are similar in style I might need to check it out.
---
I don't even talk about tips, I just /y PM ME FOR PORT TO UC
---
The first person usually tips, then I just invite as many people as I can to get them through. Sometimes I make a gold or two, sometimes I make nothing. It all evens out. I've had so many people recognize me out of the blue and thank me for the free port, and water, and food. I always buff everyone I can, even asking warriors if they need int for leveling weapon skill. I've had nothing but positive experiences on Smolderweb.
---
I should sue this guy for stealing my business model...
---
Toy story
---
I couldn't wait to get back into SM... 30-40 went fast.
---
Everybody roll need to prevent ninjas.
---
I think what they meant more a "press one button and five spells get cast, one right after the other with the gcd" which is still bannable as botting. That or say you press a button before the gcd is off and the add-on casting a spell once the GCD is off, which also can't be done. 
---
You could make a macro that casts Spell A, then B, then C all with the same button but you'd need to click the button for each spell.
---
Dismissing is a nub move anyways when you have eye of the beast and stay
---
OKAY 306.
---
Better?
---
I let Orc tanks that Pop it die and tell them their dumb ass made it impossible to keep them alive.
---
Mained gnome mage for years, can confirm.  Died twice many times due to rogues.
---
Sounds like someone hasn't been able to get their own BT...
---
I highly recommend creating at least one bank alt that you can send all greens or items you want to sell on the AH. There's always a mailbox near quest hubs so you can unload your bags to the bank.
---
Hey man, AH gains &gt; stat gains before level 60
---
That, and when not partied with a designated tank you're not going to get full utilization of backstab.
---
Hey, that’s my server :D Thanks for doing this haha. Reminds me of when I first started, there was a “bag lady” who RP walked back and forth between Razor Hill and Org giving out bags for cloth (and she gave me a shirt for free!).
---
Except nobody will know who "Senpa Image" is. ;)
---
FD and vanish have felt awful. I have died countless times where I vanish mobs off and oh wait they just keep auto attacking me because I vanished during the auto attack..
---
I did do that once and I offered it for 5G. The problem was that this warrior believed he was entitled to roll on any piece of loot. If people want specific loot, they gotta pay, otherwise I'm not making any money there.
---
Go there so I can player kill you please
---
I hope they do proper qualifiers instead of it being a tournament of near solely "known" people.
---
If things like this get popular enough maybe blizz will open a tournament server. Doubt it but they've done it before.
---
:D
---
I want an addon that recommens farming spots for exp or a certain item.
---
&gt;low effort
---
Mages amirite
---
Oh, makes sense
---
My favorite so far was a hunter with brokentooth named BiS.
---
Lmao, I whispered you last night and was gonna use your services, but I realized my friend had seen this reddit post and would know haha
---
&gt;Why?
---
Why what? Why don't people take Imp HOTW or Moonglow while leveling? They don't give very good returns; you're looking at at least 32 to max Moonglow, and Imp. HOTW competes with furor.  Both of these are pretty harsh trade-ins for what feral gives you, or other options in Resto.
---
&gt;You just assumed that I was going full resto because you didn't read past the 1st sentence lol, a common Reddit problem.
---
How did I only read the first sentence if my response discusses your question (Moonglow vs Imp. HOTW)?
---
Once youre 40 its a good idea to have one that does.  
---
Really even if you get to the point where you can keep up the shadow debuff it gets nice.
---
There are specs that have improved sap, which gives a 90% chance of not breaking stealth. They CAN be useful in dungeons but are mostly for a pvp dagger spec
---
on an unrelated note...
---
there's something really wrong with your DPS if any raid fight last more than 3 minute... which isn't really enough time to run OOM assuming you have a mana pot and a dark rune.
---
Whenever I see a melee hittin a mob, I give them the buff and flamestrike the mob (after they tag it of course)
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
Have you been teaching echeyakee new skills? Read [this guide from Petopia](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php) for classic, Hunter pet skills work differently than you might think.   
---
If you don't have time:  
---
Pets don't learn new ranks of "Bite" or anything else automatically, and don't start off with all the skills they could learn automatically. You have to research and figure out what creatures know the skill you want to teach your main pet, go out and tame them and use them till your Character learns the skill (important: your player character, not your pet). Then go get your main pet and teach them that skill.
---
I was able to run Classic WoW at 60+ FPS on a Laptop from 2011, it's a nearly 20 year old game, it's not hard to run :P
---
“We fed asmongold items and then we watched a pile of horses stand on the anvil”
---
For someone who says they love world PvP, you sure do complain a lot about it.  I can't believe we're still having these discussions about PvP servers lmao.  Its really simple, if you don't want to get ganked, played a PvE server.
---
No way, I absolutely love warrior. It’s been a lot of fun, especially world PvP and of course tanking dungeons as arms!
---
What makes you say that? Obviously the 1-30 range is not nearly as time consuming or hard as 30-60 but to do it on this many characters has to be at least the same amount of time and effort as a full 1-60 on one character. Now if you meant they won't get 60 on every character, I could maybe see that happening but I think 2-3 characters lvl 60 is reasonable.
---
Tons of vendor trash that sell for decent silver.
---
Same here man. Slow levelers represent :D
---
I think this is indeed a factor that heavily influences this in Classic WoW. This wasn't the case back in the day and you needed to talk to other people to find out about quests and where to do them I suppose. That sounds like a lovely guild you joined. The good thing of Classic is that I'm pretty sure the majority of the people playing are pretty mature people in their 20's to 30's or even older but those people are often the nicest to play with.
---
I’d say you are in the minority then haha. I played hunter in vanilla and dual wield’d BS Hatchets, just because less competition and much greater drop chance. 
---
I always tell my guildies to sort out loot shit before the dungeon is run. 
---
I got called a ninja looter a couple weeks ago because I rolled need on a BoE blue, kaleidoscope amulet or whatever. The shaman said it was a “huge upgrade” for him. I just let him and another person re-roll because sometimes it’s just not worth the headache. 
---
Intentions and communication is important. I always err on the side of being polite to establish better relationships with people on my server. It probably doesn’t matter as much on the full servers.
---
God, I remember all the RP Weddings we had on our server back in the day here.
---
Congratulations.
---
30 is a really big milestone.
---
Booo
---
50-60 is fine.  
---
You have Un'goro, Felwood, Winterspring, Azshara, WPL, EPL, Burning Steppes, and Searing Gorge.  
---
Order I am going is Gorge -&gt; Felwood -&gt; Ungoro -&gt; steppes -&gt; wpl -&gt; epl.
---
Hey these are some good ti-- wait a minute...
---
The extra gold or two you get doing this isn't worth being a dickhead over.
---
I'm not a huge fan of WC or SFK, mostly because they take a bit longer and groups aren't always as easy to come by. I run them for the quests but that's usually it unless I need gear from the place. But yeah the distance you have to run around for stonetalon and ashenvale is what really kills me, especially since there aren't a *ton* of quests in each area. Once I get out of SM I have a mount or am close to it, so it gets less painful overall.
---
I got yelled at by some rando for pulling too slowly in an open world cave.
---
Its not a recipe the trainers would tell you
---
This is why I've disliked transmog from its inception. I quit wow after wrath and when I came back everyone looked like a bad ass. Wtf? What happened to having to earn your bad ass gear?
---
I wasn't trying to accuse you of it  specifically. I just got those vibes in general from the whole conversation. Wasn't singling you out. Thank you for clarifying your position and looking at it from a positive perspective.
---
I would even go as far as saying that's the text book definition of greed.
---
Hahaha that's awesome.
---
I wouldnt... lol As a horde I can Say we will be waiting for you... unless you wanna do a corpse run before every reset i'd stay away from SM. there are about 50+ Horde there that will just kill you on sight.
---
check comments before posting
---
I'd feel like shit if I was rejected in a video game.
---
I'm sure if you search my comment you can find the word "always" in there somewhere....
---
No one's denying that you can "get by just fine" just that clicking important things like Polymorph, health potions, CDs, etc. isn't optimal.
---
Just buy the biggest bags you can - seriously.  Buy at least some 14 slot runecloth bags at like 3 ish gold a pop.   Yes its like 12g or so spent, but the earlier you can do it, you WILL earn more than that and then some, and still afford your mount because you're not having to choose so much what you carry.
---
Are you using a healing addon like VuhDo/Clique/etc?
---
Hey wanna tank for me?
---
Of course they can be skewed esp based on the time of day the individual data is collected, but unless there's a new Armory for Classic or Blizz themselves releases their data, this is all you are going to get.
---
Also, character data is a HORRID stat to look at when comparing server balance since 5 alt will count the same as 5 mains - the Census Plus mod (which I had been using) provided the number of character caught during your scan which gives number of live players seen at a given time and was in the Beta phase before /who got disabled for addons.
---
On pservers, I used an addon called LightHeaded that imported archived wowhead comments into the quest log, and showed entire quest chains / rewards as well. Havent been able to find a working version yet
---
My tank rotation is if my group wants to do AoE, I rotate them out in favor of ones that are willing to use CC and I sunder/revenge no more than two mobs.
---
Yup. All use the same mana.
---
That's just flat wrong, why is everyone parroting this?
---
what spec are you using? If you can spare it, some of the early talents in beast mastery give your pet more health and armor. Probably a good spec for leveling in general!
---
Be ready to die before getting into the instance. At least once.
---
battle groups came in patch 1.11
---
Good luck on your adventure!
---
I would carefully avoid any player this confused, unless I just wanted to watch a train wreck group in action and then post EVEN MOAR lols for Reddit points.
---
Definitely, 50+ ain't that good in English
---
I would to after being convinced to run from Darn.
---
A working version of DrDamage would be lovely.

---
there are tons of quests from 55-60 you probably just missed them since vanilla is not structured arround questhubs but are rather somewhat hidden or long chain quests that force you to change zones quite a bit and you completely miss out on if you didn't find the entry.
---
Any of what cards? Probably not all on DVI, my 970 has 2 DVI and an HDMI; I only *need* to use DVI for my 144hz primary monitor. HDMI is absolutely fine for secondary and tertiary monitors.
---
I did. I saw you post "Census Plus" in another comment. But that addon appears to be broken at the moment. So I ask again, how up to date is the data?
---
yeah it has, plus so much has changed in the time. Ninjas were called out those days and people basically shunned them off their server. Anymore you call someone a ninja and you get Go Back to Retail, it's only a blue item, or who cares.
---
South Shore is the closest flight point to SM. From there run North and swim across the lake, the murlocs there are level 18’s.   
---
Head NorthEast after crossing the lake to SM.  Careful, guards roam the outside of SM and they are elites.  
---
Probably the quickest and safest way to SM, otherwise hope your party has a warlock that’s willing to summon.
---
Try all of them! I’m trying to get one of each class to level 20 before I push one all the way to 60.
---
Hey, this is the intro for my newest dungeon guide video! You can check out the full thing here!!!

---
To be fair a lot of people on both sides do that when their current questing area is overrun with the other faction.
---
That's a shame. A lot of folk preaching doom and gloom about demographic disparity based on anecdotes and incomplete data. I wish there were a better way, because personally I'd love to go on an A heavy PvP server as Horde, but without a way to know for certain that's true on any given server there's really no motivation to move.
---
Idk who ever expected Ally to outnumber Horde.  Polls showed horde edging out Ally 55-45 on pvp servers prelaunch which is probably a fairly close estimation to global pops now.
---
Being outnumbered 3-2 is tolerable but 2-1 is a problem.  The "fix" isnt the same as a bug fix and obviously their last solution in retail is also an issue.  The "fix" in this case is to leave the decision to the players but to "encourage" balance through the use of queues and/or faction specific transfers.  I don't think these would be used in a way that is too disruptive but more so in a way that will gently persuade some people on the fringe to  xfer.
---
And now I'm broke. Worth it.
---
As soon as you enter the game change networks that way the grace period lets you log back in.
---
We didnt listen!
---
No, it was there.  I got it during the Harvest Festival event when i went to honor Uther.
---
I had no i dead i wanted this but i want this so much! -and it has to be LOUD.
---
I will prepare for death. I am a warrior so I kinda die all the time hehe
---
"which part of SM?"
---
"YES"
---
I love the guy's enthusiasm
---
5g before and 2g after
---
I always roll need, I try to feel out the group but I usually roll need so some tool cant ninja.
---
Probably cause people are lactose intolerant? :^)
---
Thanks for sharing that constructive criticism, stranger. 
---
Have a nice day!
---
Who hurt you?
---
A good player is more important than a shield or prot spec or a shadow priest healing. What you are describing here are problems related to bad players
---
Yeah, what's up with that? No honor points yet, and a lot of the time we can just run through you guys anyway. If understand if a few hordies wanted to camp a while, but why are there always like a full raid of horde right there?
---
Yeah, but..... Where?
---
Thank you sir!
---
So true. So damned true.
---
I think my phone managed to smooth it out just right.
---
Yea... not gonna lie, the stigma around hunter and huntards played a small part in rerolling my class.
---
Sure the better move was to ignore it but it's grating hearing it over and over.
---
I'm not sure what the problem is. Just say 'no thanks' and move on.
---
Could it be due to any of your addons? I've had some addons outright crash my game.
---
LOL, fair, I'll take it
---
I mean, I had the glorious job of killing bugs in Feralas last night as I am L46. The life of a hero.
---
(though TBH Silithid's are rad and a great enemy)
---
That's what I keep thinking. Its able to only hold aggro for a second or two when the fight starts, but once the DoTs kick in, it can't hold aggro anymore even if it taunts. Is this perhaps a bug?
---
Thanks for linking this thread...a wealth of info that I will definitely look into!
---
Probably has something to do with Classic being unable to utilise more than 1 CPU core, meaning excessive heat builds up due to a single core being overworked.
---
THE COLONEL!
---
Yesterday I off tanked, DPS’d, and main healed scarlet monastery.  
---
Turns out dungeons are super easy when you have two tanks and 5 dps, lol
---
I would try to establish loot rules before your group starts
---
Mage Cleave is dungeon cancer right now.
---
It doesn't work after ZG GY runs, but it has added a lot of bad habits to both Mages and Priests.
---
As of recently, I'm seeing either of those two casters pull additional packs while I'm still tanking the first pack, and then expect me to pick it up, while they bring it over. I'm like, fuck that, it's yours.
---
Hoping to get help with a macro.
---
I wanna switch weapons mid combat from 2h to sword and board and vice versa without switching stances. 
---
I hate updating weapon names but I do have 3 action bars reserved for  each weapon. 
---
I know it's something like /click ActionBar 1 
---
But I can't really get it to work and I think I'm missing something.
---
You running water?
---
Intel or amd, nvidia or radeon
---
They are trying to beat the server shutdown timer.  Sadly, they were not destined for greatness.

All of it you fool
---
I'm a level 40 fire mage on Kirtonos. AMA. At work right now but I'll get back to you slowly
---
Thanks
---
Bone reaver edge is bis for an ungodly amount of time due to the proc. Armor penetration shenanigans plus it’s a sword for sword spec and human racial.
---
Hand of rag is a status symbol and looks pretty amazing. If you have the eye, you can work towards crafting it as a side project. It’ll always give you a reason to log in.
---
If you have the time to spend. I’d say it’s worth it. Otherwise just wait for bonereaver. Are you a human?

---
Chillwind Camp is safe enough at your level, it's right on the border with Alterac and there's no high level mobs on the way there. Getting from there to SM is another matter.
---
Also it's excellent I wouldn't change a thing
---
The ERP you must get . . . [shudder]
---
As a tank, I'll accept a hunter now before a mage.
---
Yeah it is a bit annoying. Fine, make it require different ingredients...
---
Found the MadLad, yes officer take him away.
---
Just last night we run SFK. I play level 28 Mage rest of the party are 24-26. There's only 4 of us but we're confident that we can pull it off. I believe we were on the ground level of The Vacant Den when I decided to use Blizzard and pulled everything from the upper levels. Needless to say, we wiped and I felt like a complete fool. Everyone was cool about it but I felt like a dummy.
---
Facts. Forsaken are mostly evil (and I like it &gt;:) )
---
Exactly.
---
Why would they do that? Asking as someone who tends to look for "inaccessible" areas myself.
---
Stuff like this DID happen when I first started playing. Group/raidfinder killed the social aspect of retail wow. I was on a low-pop server for a long time but always found groups and used to make tons of friends randomly out in the world all the way up through Cata. But once cross-realm happened, I felt constantly lonely in the game despite being surrounded by more players than before. Not even factoring in the ability to grief people with zero consequences, people have no need or desire to socialize anymore because low-level content is just an obstacle on the way to max now. One of the main reasons I quit playing every one of the last 3 expansions is because of how insanely lonely the game is. Even when I moved to a high pop server in Legion, outside of the guild interactions, I was pretty lonely, and the social aspect is a HUGE part of why I play.
---
But thats reportable soooo..
---
Yea I find that really fun. Being low hp, but not afraid to pull the next mob because you have so many tools. You are like a killing machine and with first aid and drain life its hard to die.
---
But I did get bursted a lot and misclicks lead to deaths. Its much better post 40 though.
---
At 9?  Buy a lesser magic wand, put on immolate/corruption (or both if tough mob) and then just wand.  Honestly until like lvl 30+, your wand is easily 30-50% of your DPS.
---
Buy a greater magic wand at lvl 13, it'll last you until lvl 24 ish when you get the BFD wand, which will last you into your 40s.  GMW at lvl 13 virtually trivializes the entire barrens, that wand is so good.
---
This sounds a little like what Theorycraft and DrDamage used to do.
---
I very much echo this post.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-1644
---
Also used WoW as an excuse to build a PC last month for the first time since 2011.
---
Why are some druids cheetahs and some aren't? I assume this is an ability you unlock?
---
you could try ignoring them, they're not inconveniencing you in any way lol
---
 Honestly I don’t see a point in it anymore. On a private server I level a shaman abusing the earthbound kite, but it’s simply just not as effective in classic
---
Classic mend pet is channeled, not a HoT.
---
If I were you I would not worry about professions until you have your mount. You'll get more money faster by leveling and questing because the higher level you are the more money things drop and what/not. 
---
Once you have your mount you can go back and farm more mats for tailoring and any other profession you want. But no point in wasting your time with that when you're so close to a mount which will make the whole process much smoother and faster. 
---
As far as if you want to drop enchanting for a gathering profession that's up to you. If you want it to get you gold for your mount, leveling is faster gold grind than starting herbalism at 1.
---
Arthas did nothing wrong.

Some poor bastard named Panter is about to get whispered DUNEGON a whole lot today.

Just don't heal them
---
I used this import for rogue weakauras:  [https://wago.io/LPFM2RH-l](https://wago.io/LPFM2RH-l) 
---
If you scroll down it has links to other classes.  I did have to move some things around as they were overlapping, but that should be easy if you're familiar with it.  The only ability I had to add was distract.
---
I will look into that oath too. Thanks!
---
I do se a lot of looking for SM runs when I am in stormwind. And I have seen that some of the askers are in their late 20 early 30 so they probably have a way to get there, or have their toon camped somewhere up north. 
---
I guess you can chat in stormwind chat without actually being there. Although I have never done it myself hehe.
---
Can't switch gear in combat
---
Damn imagine if we can modify sounds and animations. I'd make warrior charge animate as a Naruto run.
---
Haha fair enough. Not even talking about getting there, but when you try to get inside the instances. Its a zerg fest inside the monstery, or at least it was when i was there a week and a hald ago. Even zoning out of the instance can mean death. Thankfully the graveyard is right there.
---
As a lock it always makes me feel bad if I end a fight at 80% mana and 100% hp and the healer is almost oom.  Played a warlock since vanilla and know how easy it is for us to use a healer as an extra mana pool.  So drilled in to me that I cringe even if it isn't my fault haha
---
Mouse over target blind macro and I bind it to a mouse button.
---
As a disco priest this doesn’t happen as often but generally if they have the courtesy to /w me first, I will politely decline unless ofc I want to do that dungneon. However, if you just randomly invite me and then decide to whisper, off to the ignore list you go.
---
That place was the only place I ever aoe farmed. As after that it became too populated to be worth the time. But I would always figure out who needed the messenger and whisper them when he respawned, I'd have them run in an get the tag on the messenger, then I would aoe the whole pack for them.
---
What's the fun in all that item's data served to you
---
Nice druid tanking weapon with that armor on it.
---
Learn to tank retard
---
Mobs have nets in the first area and there are mobs with guns around the arena.
---
You can just do something simple like this (this is how mine is set up)
---
/equip Aegis of Stormwind
---
/equip Thrash Blade
---
/startattack
---
Please note: make sure to have your shield on the top of the macro.  If you have weapon first it will equip the 1h weapon in your offhand slot then replace it with your shield leaving you with no weapon equipt
---
Yeah definitely nice being a desired DPS for groups. I think the final straw for me though was the raiding. Just 1 button and 7 other mages all needing the same gear. Really wears on you
---
It's hardly arbitrary. BoPs are significantly more valuable to equip than they are to vendor. This is objective fact and accepted over fifteen years in this game. BoEs possess an actual market value.
---
You tell me, youre the priest!
---
😂
---
I did the same with my 70 druid in full gladiator gear.
---
Last real accomplishment before I pretty much stopped playing and went on to just do BG's on my twink rogue before eventually qutting entirely.
---
If you don't want to, I'll take her along.
---
My wife will text me via hang outs in full caps which confused me given the context of the convo. She apparently uses all caps in her data entry and just alt tabs to chat and doesn't switch it off.
---
Dunno what that guy's excuse is but there's my random anecdote for the day
---
Flair: questions
---
These are around 35g on my server, biggles
---
Well I just said that I didn't expect friend friends but just some people to play with by now so no I had no unrealistic expectations looking at the amount of people here that have met new people to play with in the game.
---
This man needs a restorative potion.
---
Huh maybe I got lucky. I'm playing on the EU RP-PvP realm. I don't RP but I do PvP and was hoping the RP would make for some extra socialising. The guild I joined was very chatty.
---
The other day I posted “38 Mage LF Cath” and some genius responded “it’s in between GY and ARM”
---
Because he's a 'retail SUPER BAD, CLASSIC GUD' kid.
---
Yea hmm....
---
At what level do alliance players do SM runs? All those lfg calls I see. They surely can’t all be in their 40ies?
---
It's gonna be dependent on the group.  I've had mages stand up from drinking at sub 50% mana because I started the next pull, melee will run at half health into mobs that cleave because I pulled.  I've had new healers that get panicky when I pull when they're sitting down drinking and are at 50-75% mana and immediately stand up and start precasting a heal.  You gotta feel out each group, and *generally* that pace is going to be set by the tank, or perhaps the healer, it's DPS's job to sit back and adjust to that pace, not be an impatient mongoloid and do stupid shit like pulling for the tank and getting mad when mobs come charging past the tank right at their face.
---
I understand where you're coming from, but the common denominator in the *vast* majority of situations is incompetent DPS, not tanks.  DPS need to adjust their play to how the tank is tanking.  If the tank is waiting for the healers mana, then DPS needs to not get impatient and pull for the tank, or blast cooldowns or big spells before the tank has gotten a swing in, even if the tank could have pulled when the healer was at 75% mana, just because he didn't isn't an excuse for DPS to go nuts then blame the tank for pulling too slowly for their liking.
---
30-35 is the same as 1-25.
---
Just the Elites I think, Dragonspawn, Drakes, and Wyrmkin.
---
What are your talents and what level are you? You get significantly better at healing yourself with talents and later abilities like Death coil and Soul Siphon, and improved drain life.
---
Map addons that includes dungeon maps with boss info tab while you're in it and on world map tell you the lvl of the zones. I had one like it back in 2006 and cant find one now.
---
Dwarves are friends, not food.
---
Fuck everyone else, though.
---
You would need to iterate over the contents of the vendor's items, check its name, then buy it if the name matches what you need.

Un'Goro, Burning Steppes, Feralas, Winterspring, WPL, EPL, etc.  I usually find the 50s pretty easy, actually.
---
On gear, Spirit has an itemization budget of 1 while mp5 has an itemization budget of 2.5.
---
4 points of Spirit provides 1 mp2, or 2.5 mp5. 2.5 points of Spirit would thus provide 1.5625 mp5. So Spirit is approximately 56% better than mp5 at regeneration.
---
If your time is divided between receiving 15% of this value and 100% of this value, the breakeven point is approximately 75% of your time spent in FSR. Spend less, and Spirit rapidly becomes better. Spend more and Spirit becomes worse.
---
With the set bonus, this rises to a bit over 90%.
---
Add in notions like healer rotations and Innervate, and a Holy Priest gearing mp5 is generally a bad idea.
---

---
&gt; Insulted you how? 
---
You said all of these things to him:
---
&gt; You just want your cake and eat it too.  
---
No, he's managing expectations in one way.  
---
&gt; So you're saying that you're a pessimist and you're unable to trust anybody? You assume the worst from people at all times in order to protect yourself from being taken advantage of?   
---
He didn't say any of that
---
&gt; It just sounds like a pretty sad outlook on life.  
---
Really?  A loot distribution system is a symptom of a sad outlook on life?  
---
&gt; I'm not going to pre-emptively do the wrong thing (an indictment of me) expecting somebody else to do the wrong thing. It's a sad way to live.  
---
Implying that he's doing the "wrong thing"  
---
&gt; You're purposely abusing the system by needing on something that you don't need.  
---
I don't know about the rest of the readers but you didn't convince me at all by being this insulting to another person.  This kind of argument was common when WoW came out and there's no "right answer".  The only thing you can do is manage expectations up front and declare what system will be used before the run.  Then people can decide whether they want to join your groups or Yojo0o's groups.
---
I think part of it was I'm unfamiliar with classic, so I kind of went wherever the quests took me and hung around as long as possible. This left me with a few zones with 1 quest remaining that may have led me elsewhere. 
---
I ended up flying around and doing individual quests all over because I couldn't find any good chains or hubs, and had no idea where to look.  
---
I understand part of classics appeal is that it doesn't hold your hand, but going in with zero knowledge made the end very difficult.
---
Hmm that’s weird. It works just like any other food, while you’re eating it has the restoring health per second eating buff, then after 10 seconds it give you the Well Fed buff icon that looks like a slice of cheese.  Granted that’s how I remember it from back in vanilla. My current toon in classic hasn’t eaten any yet. 
---
You shouldn’t need to sit for the full duration to get the Well Fed buff from it.  If you’re sure you didn’t accidentally move while you were eating, then I would say it’s a glitch.
---
That's what WoW really needs:  A bounty system.  =D
---
I'd roll Hunter/Rogue in a heartbeat if I could make consistent gold by fulfilling contracts.
---
Fire mage, so I don't use blizzard
---
I think playing a significant amount and being aware has something to say. It’s pretty fair to say people are whining unnecessarily. I’m a fellow gamer, not your therapist. I don’t get paid to feed into your delusion lol
---
Was it a tank or a dps? If he's a dps it doesn't matter if it's leather, mail or plate. DPS warriors often wear str, agi leather gear which is considered quite good. Spirit is suggested in warrior guides for low to midlevel questing because of the decent health regeneration out of combat (which is important for warriors of any spec because they have no self heals). 
---
That said, IMHO if it's the (MUCH) bigger upgrade for you and only a minor for me, I would have passed on that item for you.
---
Sure but a entire zone of quests gets you like 1.5 levels. You need to supplement dungeon runs or grind monsters.
---
What server are you on? Cause I don't ever want to group with you. It's a drop and should be rolled on the same way any other piece is. Fuck your gold. If someone can actually use the thing then they need and the rest agreed. Bunch of greedy ass motherfuckers in this game.
---
Yeeep. I play with my buddy who is such a tanky tank that he's leveling prot, and he gets *furious* when people pull and run away with him. 
---
And I just tell him - don't worry about it. I'll just let them die. I'm the healer, you're the tank, if they have a problem, we'll kick them and find another DPS, who are a dime a dozen. If they die a few times, maybe they'll learn their lesson. 
---
The "let them die" strategy has worked so well, I was even able to train an orc warrior who would pop blood rage on cooldown, because he believed the measure of a DPS was the *total* damage they'd done in the dungeon.
---
havent noticed that yet but I often notice if 2 mobs are on my pet and 1 on me multishot will hit all 3 ignoring dead zone.
---
Look, you can go to STV and there's dozens of quests in a single zone, most of which will have you killing 10 or so mobs.
---
WPL and EPL? You're running across the entire fucking zone 4 times for the cauldron quest chain. There's no FP till light's hope. There's maybe two dozen quests across BOTH zones, and you're only going to complete maybe 2/3 of them before 60. Then, you get to the nathanos/fordring quests, which each have you killing 30 or more mobs, again spread across both continents. And that's just WPL/EPL, there's all the other quests which have you traveling the entire world, sometimes for a single turn in, maybe two.
---
You have "more flightpaths" in total, but they are way more spread out in end game content; and it takes far longer to fly to most of them to/from major cities and you need to back track far more often. Your mount helps, but the quest just have you traveling more in general.
---
It's not about whether or not you agree with me, it's just a fact dude. You can look up /played times for speed runners, or just people who have tracked it leveling normally; you're going to spend a shitload of time doing 50-60.
---
Thanks for the link, I never would have checked WowAce! Wonder why they didn't put it on Curse?
---
I hope you continue this.  I may not be on your server, but if you were famous, I'd love my near end-game wand to be 'Made by Spooker'!
---
10/10 never stop
---
I thought with the 3rd gen out they were slashing the prices pretty good.
---
A little different than dwarfish people, since they have crooked spines and health problems.
---
Honestly stuff like that pisses me off so much. I was in a LFG Ragefire Chasm and everyone was in full heirlooms except one person, the healer, who was getting upset at people for jumping and running around because he was having a hard time clicking them to heal. I am sure another group would have vote kicked, but I spent two seconds asking them if they were new (they were) and then explaining how to open the default party frame and showed them how to click on that to heal people. Instant change in mood and instant improvement in heals. They had just started wow that day and that was their first dungeon. Imagine if their first experience with a dungeon was with 4 shitlords who didn't have time to help them.
---
People have to start somewhere and learn how to play, not everyone starts off R1 world first big dick dps. It costs zero dollars to be kind and help someone for two seconds.
---
Problem is classic ruined retail but classic is also not 100% ideal, it's like that are cancelling each other out for me. I've been having a blast don't get me wrong but I do like some things from retail, transmog is nice for example. Diablo esq playstyle is not, everything is too easy in retail. If only they could find that sweet sweet balance.
---
Make retail leveling like classic where people group up with each other etc., that would be awesome, start some legacy servers in retail with these new rules. In the future I mean, too busy right now to care. Or just make wow 2 and implement some good changes like these.
---
How does a Druid do this? Can we just out tank princess solo at 60? I’ve never tried
---
Gold, BOE drops for your alts, rep grinds, etc...
---
hence i suggest it :P. You just need to accept that you'll most likely die at LEAST once on the run from chillwind to SM, once you get past the Bulwark the only thing that will kill you is hordies but so far i've managed to get lucky and never been killed on the run through WPL yet.  
---
Just remember, there is a turning when you're running up that river to the North-west that takes you directly to Chillwind camp... if you keep following the river you'll need to run through a swarm of UD to reach it first otherwise and that will DEFINITELY kill you.
---
You dont have to actually loot it.  As long you cast pickpocket, you can loot the pickpocketed items after the mob dies, just gotta wait for the mobs primary loot to be looted first, then you can go in and grab your pickpocket loot.  annIt's annoying, but better than forgetting to pickpocket mobs.  
---
If you have time in groups, its def better to just manually pickpocket mobs.
---
I ran SM from 28 to 39.
---
Don’t let the measly horde outside the gates deter you. The gear is great, the xp as awesome, and the friends you meet are better.
---
Pet damage is important, but the most important thing for a pet to do is to keep your enemies off you to allow you to use your ranged attacks.  Make sure you've got the latest ranks available for bite, claw, and growl.  Beyond that your spec is important too.  Beast Mastery has a lot of pet buffs in the spec, and that's what you go into if you want your pet to be stronger.  What spec are you?  
---
I rolled a hunter for classic too, I'm 43 right now.  There have been times when I've been underwelmed with my pet, and then I research a bit to find I have fallen behind in pet training. Every 5 levels or so you're taming a new beast or two to keep current on the highest ranks of important abilites.
---
Same thing I do vs most mobs, let aimed shot and multi-shot do the damage without touching the sting buttons.
---
I feel like this should be possible. If so, I wish more people used it/did it.
---
Thanks for ideas. I'll check it when I get home.
---
*Opens door to golems*
---
Oh, looks like the dungeon ends here. Thanks for the group guys.
---
*Closes door*
---
Just try to run ZF as many times as you can stomach after lvl 43.  Doesn't have to be an XP farming grp, the dungeon itself was always used as a place to grind even in vanilla and full runs give great XP.
---
Mouse over macros and making a macro for all your ranked spells.  Super easy to make it and never have to remember to put new ranks out.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast spell
---
Just don't include the (rank number) and you get the highest rank.
---
Joking isn’t shitty and has never been. If you want to be a party pooper than you might as well consider what Im saying is right. After a human starts to decompose it ain’t going to look all beautiful. So my transgender character has nothing to do with me being a shitty person. Its just how it is. 
---
You are just one of those people that thinks that everyone is against HBTQ-people just because they mention it in a somewhat funny sense..
---
Now they know that we know that they know that we know.
---
That's like saying a rogue shouldn't stealth while leveling. You are missing out in important abilities which accelerate killing.
---
Mass invite guilds are just anther lfg channel
---
The same thing that mages do against targets immune to Fire, Frost ... use another type of damage
---
ive found that alot of those were addons lol
---
i asked a guy about that, he appernetly downloaded some class specific addon and it did that shit. and he liked it ofc
---
Messaging "random" people isn't as unusual as you might think.  Consider that for any given dungeon, there's a sweet spot of 3-4 levels where you can reliably perform your function and you aren't wasting your time given the XP and loot you earn.  Using that information, one can skip broadcasting your message and hone in on exactly what you need.  Consider also that you can target players that aren't in the same zone as you, not in trade chat, and players who may not even know that the global lookingforgroup channel exists.
---
Twilight Zone!
---
To date, I'm the only person I've seen use grenades or sapper charges in PvP.
---
Granted im not 60 yet, but holy crap, you can legit delete a group of alliance with an elemental mastery Chain Lightning into Fire Nova + Sapper charge.  Sappers crit HARD!
---
I mean the "could go to XXXg" price..
---
Countless fucking times as a healer, I have gotten the heal off and the guy still dies.
---
I have adapters.  HDMI would work.  They just don't have DisplayPorts
---
Always need BoEs
---
I was in an instance yesterday with an orc tank that was popping blood fury and never using Sunder. It was a fricking nightmare
---
Water plz
---
UPOVTE
---
I'm not talking about needing a threat meter on retail now. I'm talking about how threat meters have worked over the last ~10 years, dipshit.
---
Yep, I got that yesterday and I've been using it. Works great.
---
I feel that way every day, my friend. The other layer is always greener...
---
That’s pretty much it! You can also stack shadow weaving quickly and cheaply while the tank builds aggro by using rank 1 shadow word:pain. 4/5 in improved mind blast is nice for end game PvE as you can fit 2 mind flays perfectly between each mind blast with the reduced cd. This is at 60 with decent spell power gear. I linked my gear in another reply :)
---
I saw a dude buying /spits on someone who stole his mining node while he was killing something. 1g per spit, must provide proof.
---
LOKTAR
---
It's really good exp. You get~40k an hour with a decent group, more with a good one. Plus tons of green drops.
---
Yea in fairness I think that's definitely my problem. I hesitate too much adding people as a friend unless they add me and I just have to accept. From reading many comments here it seems like dungeons are a great way to meet people to play with so I should definitely give that a go!
---
If it is BoE every one did 20% work to get it to drop, and they get a 20% chance at 100% of the gold value.  BoP are not tradable and you greed it unless it is an upgrade for you then there is the priority rolling as a needed
---
Told a mage to not AoE two mob pulls because it was a waste of mana. He said "it takes like 2 secs to drink guy." Next pull he was oom and it took 20 seconds lol.
---
Then at one point he started AoE on a single mob pull. I just said "lol" and he left the group.
---
I don't understand this obsession with AoE. I've ran into mages questing using blizzard on single mobs. Unless there's something they know that I don't it doesn't make any sense.
---
r/SUBREDDITNAME
---
No, not really.
---
They didn't want to limit and exclude people from being able to play with friends. Limiting faction numbers creates situations where not everyone is able to "play how they want" which is important from a subscription retention standpoint.
---
I wonder if they think "it's their fault for getting aggro on an off target" but little do they know that healing pulls aggro so if you literally never attack a mob the healer will inevitably pull.
---
Honestly this post makes me want to create a warrior.. As a Rogue I have a hard time finding dungeon groups
---
So people should not be annoyed when denied a group but it’s pathetic to do the exact same thing?  Look, in real life sure, don’t be a petty bitch.  Be kind, pay it forward, be a good doobie etc.  In game you can have 50 valid reasons why you do what you do or none at all.  If today I decide I will never group or play with x class, its 100% my decision as a paying player to do so within the ToS.
---
&gt;an impatient dps who pulls before the tank, doesn't attack marked targets, refuses to CC, etc, are all extremely detrimental to the entire group, and can't always be covered for by a good tank.
---
The moment they start doing this shit I give them a warning.
---
The second time they do it it's the moment I tell them I'm sorry but they clearly need to look for another tank cause I've got no patience for that shit, and HS out.
---
I think he will once he was a release version. He linked to it in the comments of the retail addon on Curse.
---
I had this issue as well but what worked for me instead is mic scrolling battle text! It showed how much of a heal went off and the name of who it healed. It isn’t above the head but it was finally a visual number
---
I'm 48 and affliction. 
---
Getting better at healing myself just means I can take 1 more mob! 
---
Basically, my pet goes in and gains agro on 1, I light up and dot a second one, fear it, turn to pet's mob, light it up with dots, find a 3rd mob, light it up with dots and fear. Now 1st mob is returning but will die by the time it gets to me. Rince repeat. 
---
I have 150 or so shadow spell dmg, so I can usually kill mobs in just a single set of dots, unles they are extra tanky.
---
So your experience is the only right conclusion? Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it hasn't happened.
---
Engineering. Always gonna want more ore for that.
---
Grobb has been the greatest so far. I live for world pvp and invasions. Like what's the point in getting geared if I cant take out Thrall with the boys.
---
Agreed. Generally the 35-42 hump is the worst for me, because 40 feels so significant, then I reach it and feel like it's such a big deal I should stop hahaha.
---
Good thing I'm 44 now.
---
I dont see how you can get offended when someone asks you personally if you want to do dungeons with them. Maybe you are on their friend list. Maybe they remembered you from a group and would like to play with you again. You should take it as a compliment. I get asked a ton of times each day for dungeons, and if I ain't busy I'll go. It's a social game, trying to pigeonhole everyone to use lfg or bust is very unhealthy for the mmo aspect we all came here for.
---
Seems to be a glitch.... I’ll reach out to a GM or something.
---
&gt;What?! You're a fucking PUG! I don't care if this BoE might be BiS for you. I'm not letting you get away with 40 gold
---
Is it not bis for everyone else, too? Sell item-&gt;buy bis-&gt;???
---
*Laughs in former maxed Runescape player*
---
Getting to 60 was so easy and enjoyable
---
Ive cleared naxx on both factions and the impression I got is that Horde has it much worse at endgame.  BlackRock mountain being right in between the two most popular alliance cities gives allies a huge advantage.  Horde raiders are pretty much required to have their hearths set in Kargath for BWL and MC,  whereas alliance can afford to set it to a bunch of different places.  The only thing that horde has on alliance at endgame is easier access to dire maul.  Pretty much everything else favors Alliance geographically.
---
Also,  horde have to deal with totems which makes positioning and group composition much more vital and intricate.  Alliance pally blessings aren't limited by range or party and are therefore much more forgiving.  When you also take into consideration the lack of fearward and other little things,  it is fair to say that Horde is definitely the "hard mode" of endgame PVE.
---
That would actually be legit as fuck
---
You might want to check that you have all of the folders that are supposed to be in Atlas Loot... If I remember right I think that is one of those add ons that has multiple folders under it.
---
A - Did you get the classic version?
---
B - Which site did you get it from?  I've found the Twitch App and [wowinterface.com](https://wowinterface.com) to be the best spots so far to find those.
---
Lul my drunk mage RL friend and the other mage in my uldaman group trolled eachother to the point of the other mage leaving after it took us an hour to get everyone together. Was not stoked. Super annoying sorry you wasted all that time.
---
Because the spell cleave groups are farming trash mobs. For instance in ZF they stop at GY and don't fight the boss.
---
I do play on rppvp server. So there is slightly less ganking of low level players. Fingers crossed. 
---
I will keep your tips close when I make the journey thanks!
---
Random whispers to tank dungeons, are one of the main reasons I rolled a warrior. I usually say yes, and have some decent gear as a result.
---
If 100g dropped would you need it or greed it? Thats what BoEs are. You should always need BoEs and if you don’t you can't get upset when others do. This is coming from someone whose BiS wep is a 1k BoE. If it dropped in random group I wouldn't start begging for them to pass
---
I use the chat addons that work like an instant messenger, so i guess because of that it doesnt feel like spam. I am still curious as to *why* it bothers you though, if we may discuss that.
---
&gt; act like a princess and have everything their way
---
When everything goes my way we don't wipe. Ever.
---
WPL, cross the middle of the lake, then sprint past the mobs. You'll die only half the time and it's still faster than running up the long way.
---
If you bid but don't win, it makes the winner bid higher. Ez math
---
Hahaha I love replying to these PMs. So satisfying. Everytime.  
---
"dog eat dog world, bitch"  
---
"nothing personal... just business"
---
Color me intrigued
---
If you sit down to drink the instant combat is over you'll never face mana issues, even with the tank pulling. This is very much a you problem
---
Hey sorry, I did misread your comment at first and saw it as Imp. MOTW, so for sure ignore my rantings about it!
---
going to try to get into groups as a 43 warr dps
---
Keep grinding that work so we can grind more at home 🤘
---
Ah, PVP is another story.
---
Not really, theirs a reason why when tanks aren't required they'll be dropped in a second for anything else. They're effectively just a meat wall that serves a means to an end for the rest of the group. Not to mention from my time playing this tanks are also usually the worst shot callers and are generally oblivious to any mechanics that don't revolve around tanking. it's just too easy for them to miss everything, and I say this as someone who MTd in a progression guild through TBC and WotLK
---
Pretty much it was pull with a couple of spells, go bear, and finish the fight that way.  This allowed for continuing to regen in bear form, but left you enough mana that if you got attacked by another player you had enough for some fast shifting, some healing, some roots, etc..  It was basically a very slow, cautious playstyle, that, in my experience left you open to defending yourself pretty much at any time.
---
When I played my druid in vanilla, this is pretty much how ever druid I knew played.  Nobody I knew bothered with feral spec (like I said, this was when it was at its worst ever), or gearing for feral damage.
---
It is almost like the difference between BoEs and BoPs isn't arbitrary and is a game design choice by blizzard.
---
Any valuable BoE epic is a gear upgrade for any class.
---
In pugs you need and it should be established beforehand.
---
Keep questing for gold. Money rewards are decent for quests around that level. 
---
Don't stress it. You made it 39 levels without a mount, you can do one or two more levels. Not worth doing something you don't enjoy just to expedite the mount a bit.
---
SL is safer and more forgiving, but its not a trap in the sense that its not viable or makes you shit.
---
Its a build that offers you good tankiness/sustain and doesnt rely on gear as much as sm/ruin.
---
I can 1v1no prob as sm / feldom and 1v2 if i play great, but i'd guarantee that if i had soul link and master summoner, the 1v2's become a piece of cake.
---
100% facts.
---
Lootable high-end, non-class specific, non-quest specific, non-"we are literally here to get the wizard this item" groups had full group rolls on items worth cash. That FBSS was worth 45k plat and it didn't matter that it was a massive upgrade for the rogue or warrior. They either won the roll or forked over plat to the winner, maybe at a small discount.
---
This wasn't a P99 thing, this was how loot worked in an MMO culture where there was no entitlement to getting gear because you can use it.
---
Ah yes techno syndrome the official unofficial song of moron kombat.
---
I'm at 45 on my shadow priest. Got stuck helping a group through a kill quest of elites where you get the mallet for ZF. Had a couple deaths. All my stuff broke. No warlock. No wand. 
---
I got my staves up to 120ish
---
Just curious: you're just referring to phase 2 bc that's when honor and bgs go in? Or are mages getting nerfed or smth?
---
Just level and use quest rewards. Maybe some dungeon loot. Worry more about gear when you get to 60
---
Turn the contrast up lol
---
Ok so its not just me? Cool
---
It requires thought, maybe not coordination (at least, not coordination not already common knowledge). 
---
The reason they act like that is the same as always. They assume they will be as good as the top players by copying them without context. Sometimes it is that simple, other times the complete lack of context (in this case, the coordination involved) makes them fail. They take zero accountability for anything (which is typical of someone who just tries to copy the best with zero outside effort) and get by blaming others for it not working, not their lack of knowledge.
---
I was in the same boat as a priest.  I spent a lot of gold keeping up with alchemy and herbalism and thus had about 30 gold to my name at 40.
---
I just kept traveling the world on foot and questing until I could afford it at 44.
---
Weirdly enough i never feel it at around 30-50ms.
---
I hope the people down in the comments understand that spell batching does insanely much when it comes to making melee classes work vs ranged ones.
---
When you ask for spell batching to be gone you are ultimately nerfing every melee class out there if you leave swing timer in game but not spell batching.
---
As a fellow tank. I'm assuming the "2 sunders on every mob" is hyperbolic.
---
If the mage REALLY wants to AOE, it doesn't matter how many sunders you have, they're gonna pull.  Same with a warlock hellfire.  What we're doing in that case is more cc and taunt/mocking blow spam to try keep them off the mage/healer while they do their job.  
---
At that point you stop being the "EVERY MOB NEEDS TO BE ON ME 100%" guy and be the "Healer keeps mage/warlock alive, I keep healer alive and taunt/stun what I can"
---
For pvp? If so it's shit. You want shitloads of stamina and indeed spell dmg, but I wouldn't spend gols on that. Spirit is shit too.
---
The discussion deviated quite a bit. The real reason "everyone need on BoEs" came about is as a counter to situations like what the original commenter came across - ninjas rolling Need on BoEs to sell when everyone else would roll Greed.
---
It's an imperfect counter, but when everyone agrees to 'just roll need on BoEs', it negates the chance of a ninja getting a free BoE item to auction away - the ninja is forced at least to roll against everyone else on equal terms.
---
Later expansions solved this much better, by the way, by soul-binding BoEs if they were won with a Greed roll.
---
You're really this upset about 6 whispers a day? Just don't respond. I get whispered probably 20+ times a day randomly for spellcleave/water/food/ports.
---
Scarlet Monastery has separate 4 instances within it (with differences in levels).
---
You also see similar things at level 60, with Blackrock Spire and Stratholm having 2 different instances next to each other with different difficulties.
---
No, it shouldn't. I'm not going to pretend a BOE  is the same as a Bop.
---
They are different. A BOE is functionally equivalent to gold. A Bop must be vendored on the spot, else it's sold as vendor loot.
---
It's actually hilarious that you say that you wouldn't group with me, when my policy is to give an equippable item if I win the roll.
---
Luckily, there's a way for you to avoid all this. Form your own groups and master loot everything.
---
Good luck finding better groups, and I'll laugh in advance if you try to persecute someone for needing on BoEs (which most of the community agrees is the superior method). Or to see someone actually ninja it because you rolled greed like a noob
---
I personally would be annoyed at this and would probably give you the boot.
---
I like him when he's [singing and dancing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX7ehxyYRQc&amp;t=0m37s)
---
Okay? And how do I buy my boe bis? By buying it.
---
gold = loot.
---
yea i'm curious how you would solo that as a mage.
---
Is that through the big untextured landmass? I remember getting stuck there as a spirit and having to call a GM :) Cant wait to go back!
---
That's not the claim I made but I have seen tanks who can.  You never seen someone tank a group of mobs?
---
I said "throttle" which means "slower dps"
---
Stupid question, but does your class affect drop rates for certain items? For example, I’m a mage and I’ve been camping in Alther’s Mill trying to farm spider silk, and nearly every single green item (at least 15 have dropped at this point) have been cloth or weapons that I can use. Coincidence or is this just because cloth is common?
---
I appreciate the enthusiasm though
---
In theory sort of, but no one cares about the level 40 green that's worth 2g. Need on that stuff only if it's an upgrade.
---
Something I don't know why Blizzard doesn't add is to automatically hide spam. Say for instance you have two identical (or even near identical) messages within 5 seconds. Why not hide the 2nd message?  
---
Maybe a plug-in for Questie that highlights/only shows quests that rewards items with [RARE QUALITY] items, possibly also trinkets.  
---
Addon that tells you if this vendor is the only one that sells a certain recipie.
---
Ayy that's good to hear! I hope you will find a group and some people as well to play with as well. I'm leveling really slow as well because I'm new to Vanilla/Classic so this feels like a new game to me even though I played WoW for many years
---
As a solo rogue you gotta be social. I chat up everybody in the dungeon groups I join, add all the pleasant people, and before long you garner a list of people that wanna run with you, not your class. which is important because as a DPS your class is worthless.
---
Shift click the arrows when you're buying and select the amount you want (up to 20) then buy.  Sure you have to click the arrow 20 times, but theres no delay when doing it this way.
---
I was reapplying a soulstone mid fight because of a poorly times pull and the soulstone went off, went on cooldown but did not give me the target the ability to Rez because they were 'dead' when it applied.  Felt bad
---
Help, I’ve fallen and I could probably get up
---
Endgame or during leveling?
---
I feel this in my soul 😂
---
looks like someone has been drinking to much moonberry juice.
---
"Traveling to a customer's location" Typically consists of jumping off the bank. Don't overstate how much work they do.
---
I could understand 1g late vanilla. Currently there is much less gold on the server than there was late vanilla. Also, I distinctly remember trading a reagent and 10s for ports commonly in vanilla.
---
How can I always show my parties buffs? When I hover over them I can see them, but only then. Am I missing a setting, or I'd there an add on that does this but stays close to the original ui?
---
Come home from work and go to work making fake money to buy things I don't really need but want.

How did I not realize this?!?
---
Little known dwarf fact: Dwarves are actually less dense than air, and it is only the friction of keeping their feet on the ground that keeps them from flying away.
---
That's why they live in caves - they'll only hit the ceiling and can walk down from there, as opposed to flying away into the nether.
---
Yo, do you use a hotspot to play or do you have internet on the boat?
---
It doesn’t matter what it is if someone rolls need.
---
So you missed the part of my comment wheee I acknowledged that by referencing that I didn’t think to save a different wand right?
---
I wish I did the same about this comment because it was idiotic, worthless and neither worth listening to or reading.
---
Way to promote OC without giving it a chance, pal.
---
Whenever something like this happens to you, make screenshots and post on your Forum / Discord channel.
---
It's important so the rest of us dont end up grouping with them, or worse, accepts them into our guilds.
---
It's called Ninja looting, and its one of several cancers introduced in Classic by Retail players, trying to convince us that its ok to roll need in order to sell on AH. It's NEVER ok, always report them.
---
Man, did you really find a deleted thread that’s days old and reply on my dead comment???
---
Because it can worth 100g which can go towards an upgrade on the AH for yourself. So you are essentially getting an upgrade, just like the person who "need" the item drop.
---
There is also no guarantee that the "need" roller who can use it *will* use it. That person may just sell it on the AH for gold as well.
---
That's why BOP is need/greed. BOP can't be sold so it's purely an upgrade or vendored.

I'm a 57 mage almost 58. Ran ZF several times with aoe groups. Never once did the mage pull the mobs on the stairs. The tank pulled, the mage novad, and other mages or locks started aoe. If we had two mages then we used a nova rotation to keep them in place. 
---
A lot of people talking about "spell cleave" groups sound very inexperienced in magecraft. Almost as if they don't even play one.
---
I am running a Ryzen 2600 and a Vega 56. I play at 1440P with around 200 fps with some settings reduced. With the settings maxed its more like 100+ fps.
---
It's literally always just logged you in to the last realm you were logged in to, ever since Vanilla.
---
It's not just mob density, the mobs can't have ranged attacks either.
---
Spots that check both those boxes are hard to find.
---
4 lower DPS and no stam buff, plus alliance only; but not bad if you can get someone to run you through it.
---
I too am a warlock. ☹️
---
Yes I'm aware of the typical spots that they don't aggro, however this priest was right next to Qia and able to fear, when I sit in the same spot, it doesn't work for me.
---
I just kept swimming along the coastline; it starts to curve West much earlier than the world map suggests it would.  I have some screenshots somewhere on Discord of me swimming and my minimap showing me on land.
---
100%, surprised this is so far down. ItemRack kinda blows.
---
What is the name of the add-on?
---
Yea there are many people with that mentality but it can't be everyone, also I feel like those people are not in the zones I'm in since I'm a very chill/slow leveler taking my time
---
I gave you a couple to help offset it. Don't worry. It's just fake internet points. The only points that matter are the points in your heart....and your wow gold balance.
---
Is this why I have weird issues with my rogue openers sometimes?  Often times I'll sap something and inexplicably auto attack it immediately and break the sap.
---
3 second server ticks

&gt;My question is, who is buying these seemingly useless epics?

People with excess gold that want some better gear?

I mean I know you already know this and are being obtuse, but cmon man.

You're the hero we need but not the hero we deserve
---
You still kind of look like a trick-or-treater holding a dagger and a candy apple ;)
---
Correct, but there is a way to position your characters screens to where your mouse will be over all of them at the same time. (There is enough hitbox around the bobbers)
---
With 5 boxers, doing this you’ll usually get 3 catches and 2 too early / too late. With high enough fishing level gear that might change a bit.
---
Alternatively you just use the small windows you can overlay onto your main screen to do all five separately.
---
WRONG! Go s on a d.
---
whirlwind axe is shaman weapon!!!!
---
I'm not sure if its in Classic, but in Vanilla. There was a an island way way south of Tanaris. You had to swim until fatigue killed you like twice I think before you could get to it.
---
Coincidence.  Your character changes nothing about drop tables.  You as a player have your own luck - but that's a completely different thing.
---
Live man, dead man. Not-dead man. Need to have had 2 arm 2 leg 1 head or no good eat.
---
Interesting. I don’t use that tool nor am I having a particularly hard time farming the silk, but that’s good information to have!
---
Sure but even something like brd isn't exactly any sort of challenge assuming even half competency. 
---
Actually crazy to me that people don't understand basic mechanics like that by that point, even if from other games.
---
i know and some dont have what youre looking for.  Also, id prefer a comprehensive list or step by step for quests if im looknig it up and not having to resort to reading through user comments
---
They can but those poor wolfs :(
---
Even without a mount it does other nice QoL things. Like being able to just start casting a spell from a sitting position by clicking the spell. Nice for any caster dps that is sitting and drinking often.
---
Why gnome or undead?
---
WALK
---
That’s not me..
---
If you're hitting Scarlet Monastery, Uldaman, Deadmines, Stockades, Maraudon, Zul'Furrak, RFK, RFD, Sunken Temple, Gnomergan, BRD, etc., and you're doing some of them multiple times and completing most/all of their quests -- you'll easily get 5+ levels from that alone -- if not more.  Take that away, and you can kind of see why it can be a grind at times for folks that don't hit the dungeons.  Even if you skipped, say, 30 quests -- that only makes up one or two levels.  And the other guy probably skipped some quests too - it's not uncommon to have some quests leftover that you couldn't do at the time, and that you eventually outleveled before you got around to doing them (or it just wasn't worth the time to trek back for some lone quest or two).
---
25
---
Yea, same here. I'm sort of lamenting how quickly they're going this time around. Ungoro is getting me to 54 faster than I anticipated and there's so much killing to be done in the Plaguelands, between that and a few BRD runs it feels like the journey is almost over!
---
in retail the class color of shaman is blue. in classic it is pink like paladin.
---
Shift click the item and select how many you want.
---
You can't pickpocket players but you can go behind someone and do a emote such as "/e Fgalindoatsjc steals 3s from your pocket." It's really funny to watch them freak out.
---
You can run Lib for sure. I have tanked arm at 34, but it was a huge struggle due to orange enemies. Probably 36 to do it comfortably.
---
Start with using your mouse to turn and rebind strafe to AD. Get use to that then start binding the abilities you use the most to Q, E, R, F and C.

awesome, i plan to respec to fury at 60 to grind out my pre raid bis (as dps or tank), can you give me your talents? Also do you carry 2 sets for dps and tanking?

Other groups exist or you could start your own even. As a warrior and a mage both I have gotten into groups of cleave or otherwise with a bunch of rogues and hunters also running with me. No one is being excluded you just need to look better.
---
+shadow damage is overrated for leveling IMO. Spirit all the way, you'll get more mileage out of being able to cast an extra MF/MB than a little bit extra damage on each spell.
---
you get used to it fairly quickly.  id recommend trying it at least
---
That’s what happens when you pick the easy faction :p
---
At this point, let them die.
---
Not me, or course, because I'm a warlock and since it's pre lv60 I'm Drain tank specc's and whether or not I could solo the dungeon is up in the air at this point, but it's looking more and more likely.
---
But the other DPS? Fuck 'em.
---
I mean I hope I get you in my groups so I have a 25% chance to win the boe epic instead of a 20%.
---
Why wouldn't a lock be willing to summon?
---
In my experience, If you can use it or not doesn't matter, its boe so everybody rolls. I find it best if everyone just hits need, unless it is discussed ahead of time, but I mainly pug. I mean everyone needs gold.
---
I was more thinking about bops. But yeah if you're needing a boe for offspec I'm rolling need too.
---
Many servers are still full at prime time, thank you for your anecdote though.
---
Not a bug, just how it is. VW's threat isn't always enough for solo mobs unless you hold back on damage. It's perfect for off-tanking any adds you get on a pull though.
---
SCARLET....MONESTARY!!!
---
(Why did I say this aloud like Michael Scott?)
---
I don't have a cast bar add-on. I'll kick during their animation and they'll do the "got kicked" move and after that they will do the end of cast animation
---
that's literally confirmation bias. since you playing as alliance will never be ganked by groups of alliance. ask any horde if they've ever been ganked but skull level ally or groups of ally.
---
I get that it should just be that easy, and everyone should choose a different place to play together. But in reality it doesn't work that way. People have differing play times, some people start sooner than others, maybe half of your crew got in before and now the faction is full.
---
I had 22 people trying to coordinate finding the same server and faction to play on when queues were 12 hours long. It took us 3 days to get everyone on the same server and faction and that was with plenty of places to pick. I know for a fact there are at least 6 people who would have quit were they not able to play together.
---
It's easy for us to sit here and say "yeah just play somewhere else" but your avg WoW player isn't theorycrafting about what server they should play on. They are just trying to play for the limited amount of time that they can.
---
Big thonk
---
Cheetah is the travel form for night elf druids, it unlocks at the trainer at lvl 30.
---
aw rogue is mad nobody wants to take him in grp QQ
---
Bind them as you go to make it easier on yourself.  I like to bind a few keys that I don't really need like "r" and shift-r because I found I don't really need the reply binds.  I find putting them close to my left hand makes it easier.  "E" and "F" are my main skills, e, shift e, v, shift v, q, are my usual go to.  I put a long cooldown on H and a second long CD on shift H as well.
---
It's really whatever is comfortable for you.  Bind them one at a time as you get them
---
Claw, rip, rake, ferocious bite, faerie fire, tigers fury, and sometimes opening with moonfire. That's not 1-2 buttons lol
---
Hey I'm new to the game and my main character is a level 18 Dwarf hunter. I literally just got multishot yesterday. What specifically do I need to avoid doing to make it less frustrating for my party? Is it just that multishot pulls to many mobs?
---
Vanish and I don’t need ya :)
---
I think with T-mog it was perfect when it came out, in that during cata it had everyone going back through old raids and it was really fun. I feel like if they would have made it like 3 or 4 times more expensive to do it so you couldn’t just change your T-mog all the time it would have been better.
---
I did the same until someone finally told me it doesn't drop until Phase 5 :/
---
Should be possible! I am no expert on macros, though.
---
Probably because healers have to deal with the outcomes of everybody’s poor decisions and stupidity.
---
He’s anti social it seems, I mean i tank I get whispered if I’m already in a dungeon I ignore it if I’m across the world and they can’t summon and I have no interest I say no thanks maybe next time. Keeps my reputation good and who knows I may find runs I didn’t expect because they where looking for tanks in a manner I look for healers.
---
The only thing anyone ever says to me is to turn off growl.
---
Hunterlife.
---
the addon clique does this too tho, bonus being you can use left and right click for 2 more spells
---
Are birds better than gorillas? I might have been doing it wrong for a while.
---
What rank is YOUR pet's claw?
---
If you think a mage aoeing off the bat on a fat pull is fictional, then I dont think youve been playing the same game.
---
I think most ppl are complaining about the meta of pre 60 dungeons. 
---
Even at 60, its unreasonable to expect a pug tank to drop 20 gold of engi items on a pug run, or to even have 300 engi. 
---
You expect dragonbreath chili in a pug are you kidding me?! How many dps consumes are you popping in a scholo run? Should I flame you for not having flask because it would also speed up run?
---
You want this level of optimization to stomp  easy dungeons, then dont pug. Play with guild.
---
You just said " tanks dont know how to play in aoe situations" . And your answer to how to play is drop a 5g sapper and a 1 g dragonbreath chili every pull. Or just, wait for threat like a good dps.
---
Spamming sunder and revenge while hitting tab is like 90% of tanking. Kinda hard to be bad at it.
---
You skipped steps 1 and 2 though
---
I would rather go for Bonebiter as alliance.
---
I did that many times in vanilla and we rarely wiped? at least the stair thingy. so fun. many MANY numbers.
---
Whoever needs it as an upgrade rolls need.
---
Everyone is gonna roll need anyway, though, so just roll need
---
This is especially good advice when considering that the AH prices of ore and bars are very close to each other.
---
Shut up
---
Silver award?? Thanks I guess it pays off to wait until 41!
---
Nah just salty boys that want chest they can’t open.
---
You know you just needed to take a boat from wetlands to get there right?
---
No that's actually the opposite of classic+
---
Oh it’s already happened in fact 😂 ugly ass green tunic. I might just skip this upgrade lol
---
I’m affliction lvling spec right now, here’s my approach:
---
Imp for larger parties / dungeons when you want the stam buff. If two warlocks in a group, i’ll do succubus bc it’s higher dmg and not mana dependent to deal dmg and whichever lock has the highest lvl imp buff will run imp.
---
Voidwalker when i need tanking an elite who hits too hard to drain tank, or if i want to sacrifice it to AOE or run through a pack of  high lvl mobs. I rarely use VW.
---
Succubus: best dmg / mana pool ratio (esp, for dark pact) best for leveling as it does good dmg even if OOM, unlike imp. CC options too if need to cc hummanoids
---
Felhunter - i’m lvl 43 and haven’t picked this up yet, but great against PVP / Casters.
---
Yeah nice try. We know it was you!
---
Fair enough. Then druid will be boring to play if played boringly (even if it isn't 100% optimal).
---
As a blacksmith, I can tell you that tip will about chests will 100% backfire. If you say you can't pick it, I'm going to whip out my handy dandy skeleton key and take everything in the chest.
---
The amount of shit Blizz left on the table before BC is astonishing. If they simply fleshed all that stuff out, the game would grow in size by like 50%. The only thing that concerns me is gear inflation in Classic+. I really don't want item levels that go beyond Naxx.
---
And risky af. Do not recommend. 
---
"Oh look, a blue BoE drop! ‐ OH MY GOD DONT LOOK, I'M SO SORRY, DONT LOOK FOR CHRIST SAKES LOOK AT THE ROAD MAN!!!"
---
so that rogues can buy their mounts?
---
I’m def not running with that guys group haha
---
something to show exactly what an item gives as stats - how much dodge/crit will agility give, how block value will strength give etc.
---
&gt; Not really. Skipping mobs is present in the game since vanilla.
---
I was referring to when I personally tank(and specifically when XP is in the picture - at 60 loot is king, everyone has better methods of farming gold, so skips are fine).  I get buy in beforehand and do a full run, or I don't bother tanking.  It's simply a preference and my reasoning for said preference, it's not some major statement about how everyone should play the game.
---
Azeroth with additional post vanilla content but we stay in Azeroth. Unfinished zones on the map get completed and the world stays cohesive while growing. Basically, NOT TBC.
---
Huh I play on a private server with only a few hundred people and all it usually takes to find a group is 5 minutes in world chat
---
Lol yeah, well fel concentration is valuable because if your getting hit by a mob you arent wasting mana recasting your drain. meaning you up time is longer and you have more ticks and mana to trigger instant Shadowbolts as well.
---
Mostly fun and a hint vengence.
---
Yeah, it is.  Waste of healer mana too.
---
Healer mana is BETTER served by higher dps because the faster a mob dies, the less healing that has to go out.
---
It's part of the reason my Details shows "Damage Taken" instead of "Damage Done".  I want to know where my healer mana is going and who's getting hit.
---
Is there a way to auto-login to my server when I connect to WoW like in retail? Right now it makes me choose my server every time I play
---
Take a good look at what you are doing right now my man.
---
Oh ya sure enough. Had to look it up on Youtube. It's weird they have it so far out.
---
Healers (and to a slightly lesser degree tanks) make the rules in pick-up dungeon groups. They are sometimes annoying about it, sure, but even if they're pleasant it doesn't change the power dynamic.
---
If you want to play how you want, all the time, you need a pocket healer who will deal with it.
---
Is there a mail addon that includes a feature where I can open all my successful AH mail (so just pure money) at once... while NOT opening all my other mail with items?
---
Uh what?
---
Who really cares what your opinion is of someone else.
---
Rogue is the name of the class you're playing. Rouge is a color and shade of red. You should know the difference between those two.
---
The rogues in my dungeon groups have been nice enough to open chests and then ask the whole group to /roll on the loot instead of just taking it for themselves. I guess your group's rogues' mileage may vary.
---
Any blue or purple BoE I will say "everyone roll need" and I will roll need.  I don't care if you can use it right away, odds are the person who needs it will sell it for the money anyways.  Save that hassle.
---
Stop making threads about this dweeb.
---
Level up and don't worry if you can't afford a mount immediately. Being higher level is the easiest way to get better drops and more quest rewards, and you want to level up anyway, right?
---
This is a special achievement.
---
It's not that I don't like him, it's that I just don't care about him in the slightest. If it weren't for this subreddit I would have forgotten he exists quite a long time ago.
---
Amen!
---
There is no such thing as " morally repugnant content"
---
Yeah the stealthing when in combat thing actually helps us I guess...and happens all day with me too.  Just gotta spam that cheap shot before they attack you.
---
r/technicallyfish?
---
Not that north! Your other north!
---
It's hilarious to me that 50% of classic is warriors and not one of them can be bad. 
---
The vast majority of them aren't even specc'd for max threat, they're preparing for WPVP and BGs.
---
No worries I'm glad you liked it.  I'd highly recommend occurance at owl Creek bridge as well. 
---
I don't wanna spoil ot so wint say a thing just watch it if you haven't seen already
---
So a better weapon for druids doesn't increase the damage in bear and cat forms (excluding stats ofc)?
---
Not acceptable.  "greed" is for gold.
---
Farm humanoids.
---
All of the gold grinding spots will be taken and people will toxicly troll you even if you are there first.
---
Find humanoids, farm for silver per kill and grey/green drops.
---
I disagree with DPS being the laziest role.  Probably true during the leveling process, but it starts to shift pretty suddenly to healers, especially once you start getting into situations where DPS are held to some kind of a standard as everyone gears up healers jobs get pretty simplistic.
---
Healers are still doing the Lord's work though, never forget that.
---
The problem with this logic is that NOTHING is worth 100g right now. 
---
The economy doesn't exist for twinks or crazy prices yet. I've got two twink blue BoEs in my bank that I can't sell for even 20% of their original value. 
---
So in 6 months, maybe we're having this discussion, but right now the logic is based on a flawed premise.
---
felwood feels like it has a better droprate on stuff, although maybe that's just me
---
but the timbermaw rep is alright, so there's that
---
Should all group roll for herbs and nods then too? They should also go to everyone with that logic. I’m more than happy to roll for the chest with blacksmiths, but if you want to roll on locked chest don’t expect anyone to open it for you :)
---
The best part of desolace is the low numbers of players compared to the high number of farmable mobs. I got 100g in desolace, starting at level 32 grinding centaurs till 34, then farming beasts for greys and leather until 38. Then you can move to the demons that drop mageweave and then ki those. Do quests when you get bored but stay in the zone. If you just go to desolace for the quests, you'll be bored, broke and waste a lot of your exp/hour running around. 
---
Another good spot is Hillsbrand.
---
Idk why, his voice constantly reminded me off fr. Disrespect.
---
It can definitely be done.  I've tried it and consistently had less damage taken but the amount of effort to put in, and the amount of ways you can fuck it up that can negatively affect your DPS uptime, it's just too much for long grinding sessions for me.  
---
Maybe if you can play like a God after enough practice there's also possibly some utility it will give you in PvP eventually.
---
I love how Blizzard is trying to replicate the really obscure background processes because they want to "make Classica as close to Vanilla as possible"
---
... and then they implement layers
---
flap...f...flappergasted
---
Why would I wanna kill mobs couple levels above me? Especially as mage. Warrior is like the only class (with perhaps a priest) who have trouble soloing more difficult quests (by difficult I don't mean above my level but quests like Counterattack!) so judging the game only on how warriors do is nonsense.
---
Attunements, gearing for raids etc are the start of endgame content so naturally you have to group for that.
---
&gt; If something is worth 50+ gold and its boe you're damn right I'm needing it
---
You're what's wrong with Retail. Please quit Classic already.
---
Pretty much the same over here. I am going with a different theme though. Bossfrost, Bosstotems, Bossdaggers etc.
---
Macros ftw. All current content cleared now multiple times and I've had no problems what so ever using blizzard raidframes and mouseover macros. The UI is very simple and when you code the macro yourself, you know exactly what it does.
---
This Orc read book. This Orc smart.
---
Good perspective. I try to feel the same but sometimes it *does* feel like my friends are getting ahead.
---
Shhh they're dumb and mad you don't need to correct them
---
Except they can't tank, which is the biggest flexibility druids can always offer in classic, specially since tank is always the least played role.
---
One of the officers in my guild kept linking epics that she bought while leveling.  She's 55 now, without a mount.
---
Yesterday I had a mage on reddit telling me that he should get donations for the portal at the end of a group.  He wanted people to chip in for the 18s reagent.
---
MC is not nearly a difficult as people think.  Very few of the fights have much for people to do besides heal/dps/tank.  As long as you are wearing a mostly coherent set of items which are 50+, you are perfectly fine.
---
this is bait
---
Same here, I map my bars to ' to 6 (well, I go all the way to =, but from 7 to =, it's mostly out of combat stuff like food/drink, hearthstone, etc...), and on R, T, Y, A, S, D, F, G, Z, X, C, V, B, some with CTRL/SHIFT/ALT modifiers.
---
To free A, S, D, I use Q, W, E to move/strafe and SHIFT+Q, W, E to move backwards/turn.
---
Basically, my index is always resting on F and my ring/middle fingers always resting on Q/W, allowing me to hit most keybinds in a split-second, without looking. My pinky is usually in position to hit SHIFT (or CTRL) modifier, while my thumb is on spacebar (ready to hit ALT modifier).
---
As for what abilities to map to what keybind, that's a personal decision, but generally put abilities you use the most closest to your resting spots, so around W (1, 2, 3, A, S, D) and F (R, T, G, C, V, B)...
---
So real. Fucking mages are a disease.
---
At lvl 60 sure.
---
It's that the only button hunters have worth pressing is multishot, at least until aimed shot. Sadly it hits 3 targets and if it crits on an off target early you will get aggro. But then you stand there and auto and people bitch at you for doing nothing.
---
nO CHANEGS
---
Hell, i got those on the 1st day.
---
Yeah, haven't you heard? It's the gnomish stronghold in the desert.
---
the type of guy who hits 60 is already 60 lol
---
What are you talking about? You can talk to the other faction!
---
1g is standard for a portal. If you cant afford 1 gold something is terribly wron.
---
Yesterday I killed an undead rogue where I was questing, because the general chat warned about him.
---
I then hid and whispered the person who issued the warning. We partied, he came to where I was. The rogue respawned and, thinking he was alone, went back to killing mobs. In the meanwhile, I soulstoned myself
---
When my comrade was drawing close I came out and charged at the rogue. He was in combat so he popped Vanish. Then he sneaks up and stunlocked me to death. But my comrade came up and starts attacking. I then SS rezzed and we killed him together.
---
It was hilarious to me that I baited him into vanishing and my partner came in the Knick of time.
---
Zug-Zug monthly did a poll om this. 
---
It was a resounding "No"
---
Atiesh alliance
---
Until that one time after a day of running dungeons and you realize you are fresh out of flash powder.
---
Guess I’ll just die then.
---
There’s a million mages on my server, if you’re not willing to put in exceptional amounts of time you won’t find a good spot and be stuck in pugs competing with 10 other mages
---
Following
---
Now I want to burn Ironforge to the ground.   Dwarves would have never built that.
---
I play Horde so no Deadmines or Stockade, but I'd wager i got at least a level out of each dungeon i ran, and probably 3 or 4 ea from SM and BRD. RFC + WC + BFD + SFK + RFK + SM + RFD + Uld + ZF + Mara + ST + BRD = 16 or 17 levels from dungeons. Wouldn't be surprised if it was actually 20.
---
Nothing like having only an hour to play and spending 40 minutes of it running back to your body because some jack off decided that ruining your playing time was more fun than anything else that could be going on at that moment...
---
Desolace has plenty of quests and xp though. I did like 33-38 there
---
for me it's not as much remembering as much as I find it easier to click moves on a 5 minute cd instead of making it a hotkey. I use bartender to move the moves that i click up near my character in middle of screen so it's very quick to target and click a move or tab click so I'm not moving to side or bottom.
---
Depends on what you're doing. I cruised through the 40s. 50s were slow for a bit but you get so much shit to do, plus the various dungeons. It's weird, in vanilla I always got so burnt out at 55 I gave up, but I got to 55-57 I one day and it's looking like I have more than enough quest and dungeon to hit 60.
---
bur
---
I played a warrior in vanilla and essentially quest/mob grinded to 60 all fury then crafted a 2h mace and switched to Arms to grind battleground gear.  That said, I'm leveling another warrior now and I'm arms sped, only level 20 but so far it does seem slower.  Still a bit early to tell
---
"Wash yer bek!"
---
i think the issue is people, like you, are LEARNING the dungeons THROUGH cleaving
---
learn the instance first and you'll get more familiarized with the intricacies of that instance, which will help you both WHEN you start cleaving, and when you have to run through the instance normally
---
this is classic........No Change!
---
This game also has PvP, and druid is one of the best classes in that area.
---
I’ve wasted at least an hour or two playing peggle when I should be leveling, don’t install this addon.
---
100% Agree, if they had started with double the number of all planned server types for name reservation we would not have this issue. Most people reserved their names and coordinated with friends/guilds so that they would be on the same server. Right before launch day they added a couple extras and within a week the list had basically tripled but people already had coordinated to play with friends and re-coordinating to move to another server was just a pain.
---
Had this issue in my zf run. I started DPS with another druid tanking. He was charging in and overpulling cause of mobs he couldn't see (charge on a druid costs rage and interrupts instead of stun, so should not be pulling with it). He got mad when we wiped and was told to pull with ff instead cause "I know what I'm doing, you guys suck" and left.    
---
I took over tanking and pulled with FF, pulling back into the cleared part of the dungeon and using LoS. No matter how many times I said it, every debuff and full dps would start to go out the second I used my range pull. We didn't wipe while I was tanking but I did have to let some people die. I have maul (2.5s) and taunt (10s), single target.  Demo roar won't pull aggro off you, and I won't have the rage for swipe if things aren't attacking me. If everyone goes ham when I pull 3 mobs with a single ff, I'm not going to be able to keep them all on me.
---
Big yikes man. IF this was a spellcleave group sure.  But I’m assuming it’s not considering he said he was a tank. And almost all spellcleave groups run 4 aoe and 1 priest. 
---
You saying their group sucks just because he wasn’t running a spellcleave group tells me everything I need to know about your classic experience.
---
Level 30 priest - where should I be leveling? Scarlet Monastery?
---
better keep discowontdie, someone is sure to snag that
---
&gt;People who say bears are garbage or a meme are ignorant, but now that I'm level 60 and tanking some harder content there are definitly options warriors have that I lack as a bear that would be really helpful at times. 
---
You have a smaller toolkit, but you naturally have higher health and armor and TPS, all of which make things a lot smoother in 5 man content. Things only really fall down if crushing blows and crits on high physical damage raid bosses enter the equation, and the bear is dying before effective healing can save the day.
---
It's arguable that you have fewer oh shit buttons to crush when things go south, but you're also less likely to see things go south. I've also been able to pop out of bear long enough to throw out a clutch combat rez or innervate a few times, so don't totally disregard the toolkit. It's definitely tricky and there are plenty of times coming out of bear is suicide, but when it works it's about as high impact as things get.
---
Anyway, thank you for attending my Ted Talk on Bears.
---
Seen it drop once on my third time clearing to Princess. Won the roll. DPS warrior in the group promptly jumped off the bridge to suicide to Rotgrip. Tad over dramatic I thought.
---
No, because I don't hit that greed before I haven't asked the group. But you can bet if you instantly hit need, you're the asshole and I'm kicking you from the group.
---
So what you're saying is the rogue can't ninja it if the paladin BS gets there first.
---
Is it possible to level using only duengons as a healer?
---
This^ Petopia Classic.
---
&amp; The best pet is literally the one you like the most; until you get BrokenTooth...
---
What is half ass about a druid especially at 40
---
Raid tanking or dungeon tanking?
---
Raid tanking is doable, but there are several factors that you need to keep in mind as a feral druid tank. One, you can't get uncrushable, so there's that. Two, BiS is much more difficult to farm, just because of how many other classes want that gear; and three, MCP is *the* weapon for druid tanking.
---
For tanking in dungeons though, tabbing, spamming swipe, and throwing out some demoarlizing roars are all you really need for AoE threat. They're actually much better at AoE than warriors are, honestly. Spam swipe on mobs, use maul to get single target threat, taunt if you lose aggro to the healer.
---
If you want *even better* aoe threat, de-form and cast your HoTs on yourself. The healing will generate aoe aggro.
---
I have a mod that allows me to use my guitar hero controller to play wow.  I have SS bound to the whammy bar.
---
I agree, but it also feels weird having killed such an epic lore character at level 20. Especially when continuing to get quests to kill Van Cleef-led factions into your level 40s.  
---
Like, why wasn't he more powerful...?
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/485820538?t=02h09m23s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/485820538?t=02h09m23s) thoughts on your idols reaction to the video buddy?
---
Very strange, sorry can't say for sure I would have to have been there to say for sure! Hopefully others have some insight.
---
I think there is some kind of spell queueing system in classic that removes the skill from frostbolt spamming
---
"competitive class", lol
---
note that with the carbonite map, you can't see herb/mining/hunter trackers etc. really it's the only thing stopping me from using the mod, the maps are great otherwise.
---
That's true. I'm a priest, and outside of healbot I use maybe 3 spells at most.
---
Yup, you skip all the mobs at the start of the dungeon and drop down to the ledges where the enemies reset, from the lower ledge you can shoot at the 2 ranged enemies right below you (activate your fireshield and always do the conjurers first, the shadowcasters do almost no damage). After those 2 I wait for the 2 pat and kill one or both of them if they are both casters, after that I drop down, nova and then sheep the grunt that's there, walk into the hole leading to the lava and then finish the grunt once the nova is back up.
---
After that I kill the remaining pats and then the 3 pack to the right towards the pyromancers(just make sure the pat that walks between the 4 pack and 3 pack just walked away), if there is a grunt in that pack I'll sheep it otherwise just abuse los to make the casters stop and go so you can usually kill one of them until they actually cast anything and then you can just nova + counterspell the conjurer to finish him and then either sheep the shadowcaster if necessary or just finish that one last.
---
Kill the pat between the 2 packs next and you can just walk past the other by sticking to the right. Next up is the hardest bit: The 4 pack in front of the giant cart, burn all your CDs and pick one of the grunts to burst down while kiting him back towards the wall. Once he is dead either die and run back in or you can run all the way in the direction of the troll boss, blink past the barrels near the orcs to not aggro them and then you can "wedge" yourself in between 2 rocks and from there jump onto one of them, that makes everyone chasing you go on evade and reset.
---
Clear the now remaining 3 enemies by sheeping the remaining grunt and LOSing the casters + fire shield. Next up is a "5" pack in front of the pyromancers, but if you simply shoot whoever is the right most enemy and LOS before that one can cast you will only get 3 of them following you and then you do them like the pack before. After that there are only 2 mobs remaining and you are at the pyromancers, attack one of the 2 mobs to the far right so you only pull one pack, sheep the legionair and kill the pyromancers first, it's an all melee pack so frost nova + cold snap + frost nova is your friend. Kill the 2 pack in the back second and just focus the pyromancer on the last pack, loot him and let the others kill you so you can reset while corpserunning back in.
---
Always make sure to decurse yourself and remove the flame buffet debuff by walking into any of the campfires around since it only works on the next fire damage you take and campfires only do 100 damage while mobs gain the full 1k.
---
this would be nice
---
I do.

I’ve been mainly dungeon leveling from 15-50, and my groups are usually surprised how good feral tanks are with AOE threat. My biggest tip is to get Furor early on (Probably right after feline swiftness) and pre-hot every pull in dungeons. Healing threat is huge, and combine that with a Demo shout and you can actually hold threat off everything but mages even if people attack ASAP.
---
This also makes you invincible for part of the pull, which really helps the healer in 2 spots. 
---
1: They can drink while you’re pulling and you’re perfectly fine. Some healer find it rude but it’s great if they understand you are watching their mana bar and waiting for them to start drinking. 
---
2: The healer can abuse the 5 second rule and not even drink at certain parts of dungeons. They might DPS with the mana saved (I don’t prefer this, as I’d like them to not need to drink for faster time between pulls) or they can just wand instead of heal and keep the mana regen up.
---
Aside from the prehot, your rotation is basically pull with Fraerie, Demo ASAP, and swipe spam. You can prevent runners with feral charge since it’s a long root, or you can interrupt mobs or root a mob that a DPS gained Aggro of.
---
Also always keep up thorns. It does tons of damage.
---
That’s all the tips I can think of. Best of luck!
---
VPN Encrypts the traffic
---
Lol take my comment with a grain of salt, I’m not exactly out here playing the most efficient way I could, but I have Improved Scorch up to 3, so it stacks fire vulnerability on target up to 5 times. I’m lv 30, and for mobs a few levels below me I can pyroblast to pull, stack Scorch 2-4 times, then kill with a fireblast before they even get to melee range.
---
But again, this is coming from someone who’s playing mage and vanilla for the first time, so I might be misplaying
---
I ended taking up the free character transfer because of stuff like this. New servers are super empty, Auction House is barely functional, but I can quest without being ganked every 5 minutes.
---
Yes! There’s nothing to lose by not being 60 right away.
---
&gt;I find it hard to take things as my fault when I have yet to play with a single tank who has a threat addon downloaded  
---
That is absolutely your fault then.  You've made it clear that you have interviewed all the tanks you are with to see if they have a threat add-on and found the answer to be consistently "no" and yet you still group with them.  The tank shouldnt need a mod for you to be able to manage your agro.   
---
&gt;And since threat addons in classic only work if other people have them I just gotta guess if tanks have good threat or not     
---
No.  You don't have to just guess, you can watch the sunder count on the mob for starters.  You also keep an eye on the tank and see if he is hitting or not.  That is part of your job as dps in classic
---
Oh man that sucks. My only set back was switching from mining to leatherworking at around 30 which set me back like 10g. Other than that I didn’t buy any gear and vendored everything. Can’t imagine wanting to run everywhere over buying gear you’ll have to replace so soon.
---
How do you know it's 70-30? Where are you getting these statistics?
---
This video actually has only gameplay audio.   
---
Well, I use the steam controller so it's a little different to set it up from tradicional controllers. The results are about the same tho. 
---
In the video the guy is using more than 2 addons. The 2 that I recognize are **ConsolePort**, used to change bindings and make the entire UI controller friendly, and **Immersion**, used to change the quest interface and other stuff. The other addons he is using are just for the map and quest log position.
---
DPS classes adapt much easier to the controller. They virtually don't have to switch targets compared to how a Healer has to always heal different players and thus have to always switch between everyone in the raid. [In this video](https://youtu.be/0LpSYbg6qmQ) you can see a Rogue using the controller. He starts doing quests and then jumps in a Battleground. Check it out.  
---
And to answer your question on switching between KBaM and controller, Yes, **if you set it up right**, you don't have to change your hotkeys.  If you disable [Action Bar](http://prntscr.com/pafoxr) you'll see your keys [like this](http://prntscr.com/pafph7), and then you can change the addon bindings instead of moving your spells around. If you look at my first bindings (X,Y,B,LB and RB), they are not the standard addon bindings. **First you select Action Bars**, then I changed clicking A then B as shown [**Here**](http://prntscr.com/pafsjq)**.**  
---
Now that I've said all this let me tell you what might stop you. I've played wow for many years and i'm reeeeeally used to how things are done. You probably are too. First time you try this will probably not feel natural, as it's not you've been playing all these years. That doesn't mean it's not possible or enjoyable. Just get used to it. **Using Ctrl + Alt + 3 to cast a spell was not so natural at first too.**
---
Where is the horde alliance dino mafia group chasing after you to get the kill.
---
wdym ?
---
Aah too bad i just switched from nvidia graphics card to radeon! Thanks anyway
---
I mean yeah but the quest story’s are told in a few paragraphs.
---
Yeah because that is a good reason to never get a chance at boe epics.
---
I've been MM since level 1.
---
Look at the chat box..
---
ESH. I think everyone should need BoE blues and purples in dungeons to avoid ninjas. At the end of the day that piece of armor is worth the exact same to everyone in the group (AH price). Hell, it's probably worth more on the AH than the good it'll do equipping it for 3 levels. So you suck for getting mad and he sucks for not clarifying the loot rules before the item dropped.
---
Thats just fucking wrong. Im a geared dps warrior and if I hit the boss right after pull and crit and proc windfury, I will rip aggro everytime. Doesnt make my tank bad. He could mayne hold aggro with alot of threat gear, but then hes less geared than me, not bad.
---
If you dont think you should have to watch a threat meter as dps, go back to retail.
---
The gold isn't that much if you farm the Charms. It's basically just the Liferoot you buy, which are pretty cheap. Good chance you'll find other people farming stuff and you can tag along... though I find it best to wait till 34~ before attempting to kill those 38/39 elementals. I even had some people just hand me Charms they'd farmed since they were after other drops. I've always found it worthwhile.
---
Classic is like 90% vet players. We already know the mantra.
---
If the Tank dies its the Healer's fault.
---
If the Healer dies its the Tank's fault.
---
If the DPS dies it's their own damn fault.
---
&gt; Need = you need something to equip Greed = sell or whatever else
---
That's true for BoP items.
---
**Not for BoE items.**
---
Just wondering, how did you know they were botting?
---
Yes, I believe that's it!
---
You clearly never played Vanilla back in the day where there was some modicum of community amongst people. If the chest can by stealth ran then go do it, at least show your party members some respect when you're with them. Rez is not required to beat a dungeon, get walking and stealth your way back. Don't want buffs, hearthstones, or mage food? That's fine, we won't waste time or energy on you. Take your selfish attitude back to retail.
---
Guild name checks out

You could kill nessy too huh
---
Is this mount available for the horde?
---
Thank you everyone!!!
---
They were supposed to be the Yang to the Alliance Paladin's Yin.
---
But they just couldn't do enough mitigation, which is why BC gave pallies and shamans to the opposing realms.
---
&gt; That "everyone rolls on BOE" is some modern bullshit.
---
Not at all.  Not even remotely.
---
We always rolled on BoE items.
---
Because BoE items are literally just gold.
---
Must be canadians all along 😂
---
And?
---
No one is buying anything right now.
---
An extremely efficient questing addon (exact route for speed runs to 60 for horde and alliance)
---
Addon that shows exactly the trail to follow to go to the next zone (instead of a bunch of mountains)
---
Addon that displays the map as if you’d already discovered it
---
Addon that displays my DoTs over nameplates that still looks classic
---
Nope, them's the breaks.
---
I see even a clowny cleave group do armory 2x as fast as the "lets CC each pack and focus things down individually" approach with random class selection, even with deaths on former side. Even in these random groups, when there are mages, the mages are clearly carrying most of the weight damage-wise, and often offering a high amount of cc. What lesson should I be taking from this?
---
In fact, with basically one exception I basically never saw a "normal clears" group come close to matching cleave group speed even in situations where bosses are not skipped. And even that normal clears group had ravager + a mage. 
---
In a melee cleave group, people are constantly pulling in new packs, whereas in traditional groups multiple pulls are almost never done. In the former case on the healer side, I can see precisely how much each additional pack pressures my healing and what the breaking point is (and what the tolerance for unexpected mishaps is). I don't feel like I get nearly as much training for this in 'proper' runs.
---
You guys need to start saying what server you are on. These posts are shit unless we can protect ourselves from these fucking apes
---
Faction?   
---
I would probably say do hillsbrad/SM for a couple levels before Stranglethorn or Desolance. Thousand Needles is good if you're Horde.
---
Aiight.  I'm saying that was dumb and people who think it isn't are regressive mongloids.
---
Obviously millions are gonna sub still, me included.  This is *the* game to play rn.  Purists who think it's perfect are retarded. Fun but obviously flawed.
---
Techno Orc!
---
It's been like 3 weeks since release. Most people aren't 60 now, that doesn't mean they won't reach 60.
---
BoE's should always be free rolled unless people want to be generous.  I just think about it like: noone is going to pass on edgemasters if they dropped for me, so why would I pass on sunrazor or freezing band?
---
The exception for me is patterns.  Robes of the archmage drops and my priest is a tailor, then grats.
---
I hope so!
---
Good call. While not having more powerful items, they could have more useful, or targeted, gear.  
---
Hell, if creative enough, Blizzard could in theory create sets that make entirely unused talent trees worth checking out.
---
Is there a working version of Announce Interrupts for Classic?
---
No, I just defend myself from being called a ninjalooter when I'm not. It's a weak argument to just scream "toxic" at people who don't want to be persecuted for doing nothing wrong. 
---
I've seen 2 purple BoEs drop, and everyone rolled need, no problems, no discussions. Everyone walked away happy.
---
I bet you'll be the first to come here and complain that someone ninjaed a BOE, completely oblivious to the simple method to completely erase that possibility.
---
I feel the same way at times too. Sometime I wish I had more time to play, but real life is going well so I don't want to brush those things off.
---
I get the same shit with rogues all the time. Couple of days ago I ran scholo as a healer and told the grp that I needed a short mana break as I was oom. Everyone listened except the rogue who pulled a boss by jumping towards him and making these weird twitchy movements that wannabe pvpers make. He was not particularly well geared either and was at 10% when the tank took aggro off him. I proceeded to only heal the tank as I had to interrupt my drinking and I was on 1/4 mana. Instead of staying back he continued to go full apeshit dps and got killed by a random cleave or something. He then has the audacity to flame me for not healing him. I probably could have, but tbh I did not feel like it in the slightest. No regrets.
---
This was on mograine EU btw, so if you see this you know who you are.
---
And here I just have the name Senpai.
---
I'm in the same boat, I've decided when I turn 60 to just do dungeons that are green to me and level him in there
---
You see, there are scenarios where "You spank it, you tank it." is valid. I had a ZF run last night where an Enhancement Shaman kept using Earth Shock on targets and pulling them off of me, almost killing us when he decided to off tank the Basilisk boss because aggro got hairy after I was petrified. I called him on it, and he said "I'm using rank 1".
---
That doesn't matter, it causes a high amount of threat regardless, the extra damage is just cherry on top and is the main reason Enhancement Shamans try to pad their DPS meters with it. It is the intended taunt for Enhancement Shamans.
---
He kept using it, and while I don't personally follow the "You spank it, you tank it." methodology, I was tempted to (I'd rather we all live and I tell them to stop again than wipe and tell them to stop).
---
Tanking is already a pain in the ass, DPS that can't properly create rotations or cannot concede leadership to the Tank make it even worse, and so some Tanks that aren't me think letting DPS die purposefully is healthy. I'd rather we all be alive and get called a shit tank if I can't hold aggro from (Frost Nova + Cone of Cold + Blizzard) + Volley + (Whirlwind + Sweeping Strikes) than we all die and I get called a shit tank anyway.
---
My experience with horde so far is that they either leave you alone to quest, or they attack you when you're fighting something or have very low mana.
---
Thus I have decided to kill all horde on sight.
---
You have never played a tank, fact.
---
I think its just fotm classes in general.  This time around its mages &amp; warriors more so than rogues &amp; hunters.
---
Server transfers were a thing in vanilla but had a long cool down (like several months/half a year). Faction changes absolutely not though.
---
So is your vid about stacking reckoning and the macro or is it more specifically about how it looks?
---
Nah those levels were easy.  Tanaris, feralas, searing gorge.  Feralas gave so much xp it was sinful .  Throw in some zf runs
---
any addon that shows my +heal ?
---
Mace spec was powerful in TBC because of Stormherald, aka Stunherald.
---
Did someone hurt your feelings?
---
Exactly!
---
I had a mage ask for 5g for water in SM.  I've never laughed so hard, then when I realized he wasnt joking I respectfully asked him to find another group.
---
Outside of him, I havent really ran into complete derrrrp mages.  Ran BRD with two last night who were fantastic.
---
Oh mb i keep forgetting that theres dead servers where people dont compete for resources
---
I hope you get no water or food from anyone now.....-all mages
---
Wait....... the wolf instead of the Raptor? LMFAO. The wolf is by far the worst horde mount this is such a waste of time and money!
---
&gt; without changing how it looks and plays
---
80% of addons changes how it looks and plays
---
You get extra gold for completing quests at 60, so finish up those zones anyway. Sounds like you want to
---
Teamwork is huge in classic, it's not only up to the tank to hold aggro, it's not only up to the healer to heal. Everybody has to do everything correctly with little room for mistakes. Classic is not a roflstomp free-for-all like retail. And I'm not knocking retail, I played for 10 years and still enjoy it, but am definitely enjoying the much needed change in pace that classic offers.
---
I did the same thing. Was questing, saw a mage and invited him. He joined then immediately left seeing it was just me in the group. 
---
Proceeds to pull everything and die. Runs back and invites me. I decline. Invites me again. Decline.
---
Class isnt, but lockpicking is a skill that takea time to level up. Abilities are learnable as you level. So lockpicking is more like a gathering prof than an ability
---
That's only true in cases where other people pass on the item so that a specific person can have the BoE.   If the party agrees to let you have the BoE, then you had better equip it.
---
But everybody should be rolling need on BoE items.  That's standard practice, because it's just gold.
---
Congrats, that is an incredible piece.
---
An addon to track dungeon reset timers/lockouts.
---
Macros can't auto detect a player's level, so sadly you can't make that work.
---
It might be possible for an addon to do, but I don't know.
---
Is the stress relief from playing a video game that costs $10 not a step in bettering yourself?
---
I've been dirt poor and takes up plenty of CC debt before. But I still subbed to WoW in those times. Because the stress of adding $15/mo to my debt pile helped a lot more than not having a distraction and a get away
---
It was the worst in BC. You end up looking like a intergalactic space pimp
---
*BOTTOM TEXT*
---
An epic BoE drop has the exact same value to every member in the group, namely its value in gold. If you think you deserve that item over your party for any reason, *that* is the actual definition of greed, as in avarice.
---
Which is why watching people jump from zeppelins looks all wonky like they got hit with a gust of wind.
---
Wtf are those hearts and circles
---
Back in the day our guild used an addon which allowed officers to distribute dkp to players. We had this as account wide so that if you had crafter alts you could contribute with consumables to earn little extra.
---
Basically you just have officers who keep the books and update it to guild pages or something similar. Or somw guilds don't let others see how much dkp everyone has but to each their own.
---
As long as there are rules how to earn them and amounts, someone or few to bookkeeping you can work with pen and a notebook. Doesn't really matter.
---
I did this in MOP.  Not because I was indecisive, but because the endgame was so meh and they were giving out free high level chars.  A level 30 in classic is more work than I feel I put into my 90's..let alone doing it all in one month.  That is damned impressive.
---
So when PvP becomes relevant, obviously the optimal specs for warriors are going to be very different than what is optimal for PvE.  How do people deal with this? It would be costly to switch back and forth between Prot and Fury depending on what you’re doing, would it not?  What’s the general rule of thumb here?

The reason Dwarves can't stick to the floor is that the curse of flesh made them no longer... *Earth*en

Never played an ele shaman, which would those be? I'm guessing mechanical? Rock or wind elementals?

Guarentee that thing has never ran SM before

But the reason of me complaining is getting killed by level 60's. They're not mutually exclusive. It's not my fault you can't put two and two together. A more likely explanation is you trying to peg me as a hypocrite and failing at it, though.
---
IMO the 40's have been easier than the 30's. Seems like I'm able to find enough lvl appropriate quests without as much back and forth traveling.
---
Does anyone know if I can’t be exalted with darnassus as a human starting there as lvl 1 questing till 40?

I’m hearing mixed answers
---
It's best not to fixate on level numbers when dealing with NPCs, otherwise you start wondering how the Gnomes got kicked out of their city by a level 34 and some Troggs.
---
Legion???! in TBC tanking went to "somewhat not easy", in Wrath it became "pull the whole fucking dungeon"
---
Me and another mage rolled "need" for a nice set of gloves last night in ZF...I rolled a 4 and he rolled a 3...we both laughed so hard.
---
Auctioneer downloaded from their website should work just fine as long as it’s installed properly.

You won't get invited to my group I'm tanking. ;P
---
Is there a difference between "+x Healing Spells" and "Increase healing done by spells and effects by x," or is it just another way of showing the same boost?
---
That makes far too much sense for something said on the internet.
---
Ooo ooo
---
I can say a FFXIV meme
---
Ahem.
---
HEALERS ADJUST.
---
The high rates right now are for guilds pooling to buy them for tanks.  As you say, I predict it will drop once that demand has been met and it's back to individuals buying them for themselves.
---
So if someone shot up a school because they have an advantage of a gun, sharing that they’re a bad person is getting on a hypetrain?
---
Just because people opinions don’t align with yours does not invalidate them.
---
I watch Healing taken and damage taken.  I don't usually care about damage done unless mobs are taking forever to die, and i dont usually care about healing done since it doesn't take overhealing and padding into account.
---
I want to know if that mage is taking damage/using healer mana, or if that rogue is standing in cleaves so I can either position better or yell at him to get behind the dude. 
---
As another tip, if you're not using Threatplates i highly recommend it.  Being able to see  what the mob is targeting by nameplate color is incredibly useful.
---
It's not the money, it's the time sink.  If you don't understand that, that's on you.  Time should be spent applying for jobs or continuing education.  In between classes, work, studying play wow.  If you don't have any of those things going on at an older age, you shouldn't be playing WoW
---
280g and I finally got it!
---
I use Auctionator and it will show me the DE value but not the actual mats. Is there a setting I need to enable to show the type of dust / shard?
---
One thing to take into account is to factor mp5 and spirit after +healing.  A lot of people are explaining why mp5 and spirit are weighted a certain way, but plus healing has the benefit of allowing you to use lower rank spells that saves you way more mana then you could get back stacking spirit or mp5.  
---
Also, the way classic itemization is there aren’t really a whole lot of options.  A certain piece of gear is just the best for pve and that’s that. If you need a better explanation for the plus healing and downranking let me know.
---
Tbh there's a point where if you get aggro I can't save you without risking the group. In any situation where it comes to a choice between a single person and the group I've got to let you die. Warlock life tap is absolutely going to be ignored for healing. Water costs a gold per stack and your ass should have a health stone and a stack of food at all times. Also if I big heal a tapped lock in a fight I get a ton of threat that can cause me to pull aggro leading to me wasting healing time on myself or even dying depending on the Mob.
---
For life tap you should have food, bandages or pots to get yourself up because I can't full heal your ass without wasting Mana and time. A lot of DPS don't realize that if the heals has to Mana up you should be topping your health off yourself so I don't have to waste more time and money to heal you after getting my Mana back. If you're not keeping a stack of food on you for downtime self heals you're being a bad DPS.
---
DPS just have more responsibility in classic and part of it is being aware of what you should and shouldn't do during and between pulls.
---
I think it would be great to get messages like that. It's better than inviting me to their guild that was established in 1999 on EverQuest and they plan relaxed hardcore raiding, questing, low level dungeons, world pvp, and battlegrounds all while enjoying a family-friendly environment.

Why are you waiting for P2?

I felt like this, but then I realised it actually kinda makes sense in that Van Cleef was a mason. Connected, devious, but...also a mason. He's the mastermind stirring up trouble, not the muscle.

He's a Tauren, his option are Kodo or Wolf, no Raptor/Skeletal Horse available.
---
I guess. warriors and rogue are top tier during this phase
---
These guys are doing the 200 IQ play of ripping off the UI so people keep making these posts and give them tons of exposure.

Well played devs.
---
People used the realm forums back in the day.
---
you need a drink macro to be one of the most accessible keys on your bars
---
What about tier 3 and 4, isn't TB better for AQ access and UC better for Naxx?
---
Happens all the time. No idea why. Have tried a bunch of addons. Nothing has fixed it
---
I think they may be lower ranks, but thats helpful thanks :)
---
Nope. Just horde or alliance.

&gt;Meaning that I could curate my own list of trusted assassins
---
Until they accept the contract, message the person, and split the bounty in half for ez kills. 
---
You aren't really understanding how easy it is to break
---
But that's the point, it's not a fair need roll if you're rolling to sell it. That's not what need means. 
---
If you're rolling so you can get gold (to pay for your bis or whatever) roll greed.
---
If someone wants to use the item, they roll need.
---
If you roll need when you want to sell it and someone else rolls need because they want to use it, and you win, you ninja looted.
---
It's a really simple system, you don't have to complicate it.
---
I don't think so, they're a troll racial mount
---
I say this in real life all the time. Granted its probably slang but i find it as an least effort way as possible to say yes and somewhat
---
Ye
---
The Alliance are simply a joke in Classic. 
---
Humans are being bullied by a bunch of low level bandits, their king is missing, they are being ruled by a little kid, and a giant dragon is living in Stormwind just to troll their entire race.
---
Gnomes have been exiled from their city by a bunch of low level lepers and Troggs.
---
And the Dwarven princess has run off to live with Ironforge's arch-enemies, and spends all day getting killed by players.
---
Only the Nelfs seem to have their shit in order, but I may only think that because I never spent long enough in the Nelf questing zones to pick up on whatever was going terribly wrong for them.
---
15 years later and im still seeing new things, classic wow is a masterpiece!
---
I want to make a Mage and name it "Waitfrsundrz". 
---
I get the feeling every Warrior will demand I be in the group.
---
I have no idea why he said it was 6 on 1 tbh. He also said I was 7 levels higher but we were both 30 so he might have gotten me confused with other alliance... he was in Wetlands for some reason, farming mobs.
---
The point is to group them all up into a neat little pile so you can do something like /u/turtmcgurts explained.
---
Thousand Needles (Shimmering Flats) has a bunch of quick quests good for early 30s.
---
This confusing is brought to you by new new Google Pixel, available in stores near you future in!
---
It will just randomly not work when you change mounts until you remember.
---
Im confused. I agree with you. I think wasting gold on pulls is silly and dps should wait. You think that too right?
---
Yea, druids are great tanks in dungeons as soon as they hit 60. Warriors need more gear to provide the level of aoe threat that a druid has right off the bat. Alot of that comes from prehotting, which warriors simply can't do.   
---
We actually had 1 warr, 2 bears in MC yesterday and it went very smoothly.  I don't really know what you're on about rose tinted glasses......
---
You're thinking of the default group loot. What u/Era555 is saying is need before greed, not the same. If you use need before greed a clothie can't need on anything that isn't cloth.
---
Well that's fine and all except the nameplates are already different than they were in vanilla. I can tolerate if they leave them the same, I'm just disappointed.

Not really an addon, but something like [Factorio Calculator](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html#tab=graph&amp;items=pipe-to-ground:r:40), sort of breaks down Items, and what you need to build before you can build something else.

No further discount. But at exalted you can buy that factions mount.
---
100g to respec back and forth every 2 weeks isn't a lot.
---
off topic, what addon os that, displaying all the relevant info about the item?
---
Why can't I decide on what to play? I have a 21 mage, 17 warr, 11 hunter and I keep wanting to switch because I can't decide. And now I want to make a druid and a priest. Can anyone advise me in what's the funnest? I work 12 hour nights so typically I really only have maybe an hour or two of play time unless it's my weekend. Also can someone recommend profs I might want to do? I keep wanting to do tailoring/skinning but I really probably dont need ever single toon to have the same profs
---
Still waiting for that time to come huh? Well, keep going, you'll get there.
---
Don't forget that the political infighting that set it all off is largely the result of Onyxia's manipulation, as is the kidnapping of Varian.
---
Death ray doing work though.
---
Does that undead bonus work against the forsaken in PvP?
---
Yeah I'm gonna be rerolling to undead horde for the first time so everything is gonna be new to me. Never been to the lower level horde duengons before, where exactly is the first and second at?
---
I don't follow your equation but I can tell you all mana regen is always done on a per 5 second basis
---
Tanks use Edgemaster's? I thought it was exclusively fury.
---
I play with my boss, he adheres to "that's how we did it in Vanilla, even back in everquest."   
---
Then I remind him that while I'm nearly 20 years younger than he is I started with the same MMO at the same time he did and have been playing since. I didn't play much in Vanilla as I was running about in FFXI, but "thinking you're teaching someone a lesson by not playing your role is just you being a dick," usually ends that conversation.   
---
I do my best to tank everything I can and I make it clear to the group when I'm not able to hold threat (we did Ulda at 40 the other day and the back half of that is 45-46, no way in hell I'm going to hit things consistently enough) but I try to not let even the most overzealous DPS get beat around too much.
---
Mages bad upvote me pls
---
Why would I use lockpicking that I leveled to provide someone else with mount gold instead of myself? Leeches are the ones who think they are entitled to a chest just because there is a rogue in the party. 
---
If everything in WoW was about efficiency then all group would consist of 3 mages, priest and lock doing AoE pulls. Very little number of people actually care about creating the most efficient group, so you can be salty if you want to, I’ll always be able to find people to play with.
---
Yep this is why I mark both tank and healer with raid markers at the start (I'm playing Hunter currently). So I don't run ahead of the tank or get to far way from the healer.  Also hopefully the tank takes note of where the healer is.
---
Unless we're doing lbrs and are pulling more than 3 ogres what the fuck is the rationale behind making the dungeon take longer than it should?
---
As an arms warrior my specialty is cleaving in packs of 2-4. Why limit this to 1 at a time just because we have an idiot playing prot at level 40?
---
Normaligan did save New York from ghosts and a giant walking marshmellow man...so there is that.
---
is it great though?  You press a button, it takes a shitload of mana from you and you barely see the hp gain register on your bar.
---
The gold from selling the BoE epic allows me to buy gear for my character. It’s not gold vs. gear, it’s gear vs. gear. Everyone can benefit from the item so it’s only fair that everyone gets a shot at it.
---
We did this with 2 man after our 3 mates left the group each time. It took some time but it was worth it each time :)
---
I find a way to subtlety support or endorse it just to piss you off enough to post about it on reddit.
---
or invited to the Alliance
---
Congrats.  Take your time and enjoy the ride.
---
No
---
Zulgurub but drop rate is pretty low
---
okay I'm better than average but not extremely good I guess idk what else to say.
---
No because I play without sound
---
Absolutely, I wish I had that much free time.
---
Moonkin is a lot worse though. The buff is only for the group while a Shadows debuff is for the whole raid. Also a shadow can do some acceptable damage, Moonkins are simply abysmal.
---
The grind doesn't really bother me. I enjoy leveling most of the time, I'm mostly concerned about my role at level 60.
---
dont forget us warlocks, we got those health stones and soulstones, and can follow instructions! :D
---
Don't forget Jailbreak runs.
---
Pally is good with nearly everything because he is a supporter and enables other classes to user their full potential. Warlocks as well as warriors are highly recommended as leveling partners.
---
Thanks ! Not sure what you mean by it but woo!
---
TSM has a button to do just this.
---
&gt; Can anyone advise me in what's the funnest?
---
Fun factor is subjective.
---
With limited time leaning towards mage/hunter so you don't can explore the world and adventure solo without too much pressure to group.
---
Calm down Arya
---
regardless if any have shifted drastically in the last couple days, it would be nice to have a little transparency on Blizzard's end. For many people (esp. on PvP servers) knowing the faction balance before moving your character(s) there is important information. Nobody wants to take the transfer to avoid queues only to be stuck on a 20/80 split server
---
If I'm in discord with friends I mimic him and my fiance is sitting behind me on the couch like "what the hell...?"
---
BEAR DURID IS FOR FITE. &lt;3
---
Did shimmering flats for a level, had no issues except for one horde mage my level who kept attacking me, dying and searching for me to just die again.  It went on for that entire level.  Every other horde we just walked by eachother.
---
That's a good shockadin pvp healer build that still allows you to do decent damage, it's the same one I'm running
---
45 is about the halfway point XP/ timewise. That may be a little different now with ZF farm so popular but 30 is nowhere close to halfway
---
Fantastic shitpost.
---
YouTube?  This was ebaumsworld youngin.
---
There is an additional discount once they add pvp ranks (I believe an additional 10%), but that's it.
---
Just imagine all of said above as a real fight... Wow, that mob has balls of still, a fucking chuck norris of mobs
---
Bless his heart
---
I think the posts are a meme now tbh.
---
All BoE epics of value should be need rolled on. 10% progress toward epic mount (or the opportunity to buy a BoE upgrade like devilsaur pieces) has the same value to everyone. With BoP obviously need if you'll use it but with BoE it's about the opportunity cost and in most cases it's equal for everyone if a think item drops and a person will only be using it for a couple levels
---
This is a nod to Ultima Online where if you tried to talk as a ghost it would spam this kinda shit to people who were alive.
---
Only reason to group one is to buff other members so I hope they’re doing it as much as possible.
---
Some are also bis-forever bis. Warden Staff for example. This is why I group with reliable friends, passing on their good drops to build trust and only “all need” rolling when we all agree we would just sell something. 
---
When my warden staff drops, I already know they’d pass for me to get it. If freezing band drops for my mage friend, he gets it. No questions asked.
---
You don’t get it, I wouldn’t get offended if It was a joke. I ain’t that butthurt, I would be offended if it was making fun of me and my sexual orientation as this is an offence against my person. 
---
In this hypothetical world I am joking about my toons gender, I therefor don’t se why YOU would care. 
---
Did you even read the thread? 
---
I appreciate your clearification, but your ”punchline” hasn’t changed my theory about you.
---
The reply isn't to you specifically. I'm agreeing with you and saying it is idiotic to supporting an argument with "buy items lul"
---
We already have to pay the repair bill and re spec. Tanks shouldn't have to be forced to buy items to do their jobs unless it is endgame raid
---
That's not true. Your mana regens every 2 seconds. Most of the visible statistics are per 5, but it actually regens per 2.
---
Getting WW axe early will increase your leveling speed a lot more than a mount would.
---
But both sides are just as likely to have multi-boxers or alts or inactive players. I think in the aggregate, the partial pieces give you enough to make an informed decision.
---
In try tree, why points in seal of the crusader instead of parry? Is that judgement up enough / stays up enough to make it worth 3% parry which can make a real difference in survival?
---
You mean wetlands? I've always wanted to explore those haha
---
Its weird, but I have a new appreciation for Darn in classic bc of BFA/Sylvanna's shitfit.
---
Idk I'm pretty sure he was level 60 lol he's at least 58. He has 3.7k hp that seems like a lot for early 50's, his mind blast was doin almost 700 without critting, and SWP was tickin for around 170. He mighta one shot my priest friend if his mind blast crit. 
---
He didn't have mana for re-shield - tbh he shoulda brought some pots, he probably would've won both fights really easily if he had mana. I think he coulda just shielded and pain/wanded us to death tho haha
---
With that logic everyone should roll need on every item, even BoP, because even the vendor gold helps towards buying something off the AH.
---
Gz on 37! :D
---
peak comedy
---
Yeah 40-46 was a breeze. I did 3 ZF runs and got at least 2 levels from that alone.
---
What is keeping your arms from falling off tho?
---
I’m 98% sure I compared vending prices of single wool pieces, heavy and normal bandages, and bolts and it didn’t matter. I’ll have to double check now
---
Honestly with how spellbatching works, it's main use for me is spamming it right after a max rank HL, they'll both crit and you'll get that fat refund.
---
I don't.
---
They are talking about 40 mount.  It's still a valid point though.  Grey items in sm armory or Cath sell for 30-50s.  Drop another green or win a greed roll, plus the pocket change, you're looking at 2-3g for a run that takes 30 - 40 mins. 
---
Plus, you can actually get gear you can use if something good drops.
---
I would say even if it slows you down, get stuff you need done rather than rushing to sixty. MC/Ony attune, work on pre-BiS gear. Do quests that give you the reps you want or the zones you enjoy. Ditch the travel quests or table them until you're in the area.
---
Once you're 60, no more need for exp/questing, might as well do either the most fun ones or things you'd need to do at 60 anyway (like gearing up in BRD).
---
Nope, it only effects the spells you cast.
---
The night elves lost their immortality, planted a world tree without blessing it thus giving it to the corruption of the old gods (all in a vain attempt to regain their immortality), and have tons of infighting between Staghelm and Tyrande (and their loyalists) and between Darnassus and the Cenarion Circle
---
Plus they’re getting bodied by furbolgs and shit
---
I tried to clutch Brez someone in the open world but it took so long for the game to register them as dead and rebirth usable. QQ
---
You said youre "debating just saying you cant do it and taking the chest after", right? So no, you didnt just say " a thank you would have been nice".
---
All I said was that the group contributes to getting the chest as well.
---
Yes lol. If the mages you are getting really do that then you’re getting awful mages. To be fair I haven’t seen a lot of good mages outside of spell cleave. All the good ones just want to be efficient I guess.
---
I would be ok with a global buff for the underdog faction in pvp servers that is based on the % of imbalance. So the buff would apply in all **non-instanced** areas and it would scale up and down based on the imbalance.
---
For example, a scaling buff for damage reduction and gold gain from looting and vendoring. It would scale, lets say, .2% per 1% of faction balance. So for a 55/45 server, the 45% faction would gain a 2% reduction in damage taken and 2% gold gain. 
---
And the faction balance calculation it uses is half weighted to current online players and half weighted to the previous 7 (or 14, 28, etc) days average balance.
---
Because the issue is that there are just more horde players than alliance. Transfers won't really help because even if you transfer from 1 pvp realm to another, the global balance is always favoring horde. So lets give the underdog faction a boost to help them in game to counteract that. And it will encourage some players to switch, and some to stay Alliance.
---
This is a huuuuuge change and very experimental so any suggestions are welcome.
---
DrDamage! Holy moly that's a name I haven't heard in years.
---
It even sounds real hahaha
---
This is pretty much the tanking rotation. The only caveat I would mention is that I throw sunders around but I try to sunder more on the primary target.
---
Didn't know that, that's broken as fuck
---
There is maybe 1 or 2 alliance dominant PvP servers. Gonna be tough to find merges.
---
Looks like there is no real alternative here
---
Enjoying your job because you can play video games or because it's a nice job?
---
My stream was banned by big B so I'd say it's doing well.
---
And yes I play a lot of videogames, I also study at the university so.
---
Did sunken temple earlier with a warrior that never left defensive stance
---
Argue with yourself champ.
---
How long do you think it takes to get lvl 30?
---
For real. My mage is 53 and I started a priest. At level 5 he had lesser magic wand and a full set of mageweave bags. That wand has been a beast.
---
Thanks, I saw some conflicting information from retail wow and just wanted some clarification.
---
Silver Dragon
---
Unless I'm losing it at work, the game will automatically cast the highest level version the player can have.  Some spells have a minimum level for their target, so you simply cannot put spells like detect invisibility or shadow protection on a character that is too low, no matter what.
---
Lies, if it was accurate you would all have the same emount if gold.
---
Alas, I don't think I'll ever get to realize the endgame. The innkeeper in Kargath really, really does not like night elves.
---
Mages are great because they are so versatile.
---
Play how you want to play it.
---
&gt;Staff from WC quest chain
---
I like your mentality, definitely keeps you fully engaged in the game. While I am not sure if this is the best idea, could you use something like Atlas loot add-on etc to see what drops from what dungeon and look for items that are great for your class / level? May be that will help you decide where to be and what to farm?
---
So do you basically just respec from frost to fire once you start running AQ/Naxx?
---
Probably you're right.
---
It's a passive ability that you an learn from the warrior trainer at 20.
---
With that being said: You don't want to Dual Wield as a warrior while leveling. Dual Wielding makes you miss alot of you attacks.
---
Go with a big slow 2handed weapon instead.
---
Once I get my hands on some more lesser magic essence I will reopen again.
---
I think that addon is killing the markets. If everyone knows the AH value of crap out in the field, it just drives prices down because everyone is trying to sell it.
---
why does decay matter?  if somene is banking up dkp then they are not getting other rewards...unless i am misunderstanding what decay is
---
Considering all the flak you've been getting and incessant need for you to defend your whining to everyone, I wouldn't be in the wrong. However, at this point I am in the wrong to have kept this going with you for so long. I didn't mean to stoop to your level, I'll let you have it back.
---
This is the real truth. Bandwagon People hate on AoE groups but it takes a level of coordination that most people can’t pull off successfully, and when done correctly is pretty fun
---
I did something sort of similar.   
---
I knew going in what I was going to need. I bought the liferoot from the AH early on and slowly acquired the charms as time went on. I had all the charms before I hit level 30 which really helped but the tusks...oh those would be hard.
---
I managed to snag a BOE Blue, some leather pants, that sold for about 6g on the AH. I headed over to STV and offered to pay someone to help me farm. Lo and behold there was another warrior and a level 37 shaman doing quests there. I got an invite for free and we farmed about half before the Shammy had to split. I took a short break and returned. Did the same offer and a level 40 rogue (shoutout to him on Horde Mankrik server) offered to help. Gave him 2g and he farmed the rest of the tusks with me.
---
This rogue was so badass that he came and helped me slay Cyclonian to get the axe.
---
Love it!
---
Yes but I need that 500g just as much as you need it, so I need it for the gold value, that's a legitimate need even if you can use the item there and then we both would get equal upgrades from said item.
---
I remember there being 2 ways into CoT, one in the back, and one in the front. Going to try the front one and see what happens as it was much easier to get into.
---
Here is one with some info: https://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?topic=20545.0
---
Silver Dragon is what you're looking for. Doesn't automatically find them, but if you mouse over one it'll notify you.
---
Also pings you if a guild mate finds a rare mob.
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Ty
---
Aw, I wonder why they put him there then.
---
That is so sad. Fuck that guy
---
That'd the spellcleave mentality: "don't tell us how to play! But also im going to go into other groups, be a dick and fuck it up for you because some streamer told me spellcleave is the best way to do everything hurr durr"
---
I'll stop shitting on spellcleave when spellcleave players stop trying to force it on others when we didn't sign up for it. Wanna do spellcleave? Make your own group.
---
You can also type in the total qty.
---
Just shift click, then type the number.
---
Frostbolt.
---
Yea i'm a pretty slow leveler tbh so I have to be careful with that, but yea i'll keep trying for sure :)
---
You make Yog Sarron proud.
---
I have a buff macro on my mage, but it only gives the highest buff, actually using the arcane int buff will give whatever buff they’re high enough for
---
Hey, I resent that remark, I will have you know that my Night Elf Rogue is a.........oh wait, nm
---
&gt;  No other classes, at least during leveling dungeons, needs consumables to be fully effective.
---
Literally every class needs consumables to be fully effective, what are you talking about?
---
As long as it's in game currency, it's fair play. If you were charging people real money, it would violate tos
---
Pretty sure you can just type a 20 into the number box when shift+click buying from vendors.
---
I’ve met people like you and it was the funniest shit in my life. Always fun to watch someone roll for a locked chest and they typing something like “congrats on victory, now you can open it :D”  But again (yes, again) most people have an understanding of how the game works so simple “why do you want to roll, do you have a key?” is enough.
---
Personally I love the random whispers. I feel bad when I turn em down but I like that people are messaging me, especially when it’s someone I’ve group with before.
---
Like what kind of stick do you have up your ass that someone asking you a question gets you irrationally angry.
---
Use classic.wowhead.com then click on item finder. You can then sort this list by level, classes and how you get the item.
---
Great tool for finding gear or something your missing.
---
I've been investing way too much time into this game and I'm 54, so yeah.
---
Yeah wait, is everyone else in this thread crazy, or is it me? My game absolutely downranks my fort buff to the highest rank they can accept automatically; and will only say "target too low" for things like divine spirit which can't go below level ~16 or whatever.
---
Atlas classic also breaks nearly every other mod that touches the map (like questie). Not worth it imo, just open wowhead.
---
I would have instantly ignored someone who opened up a whisper like that loool
---
I don't think the book guest stars Kareem Abdul-Jabbar though. I'll take the TWZ episode.
---
Tanks have two jobs. The firs to get the thing to hit them in the face. The second is to not die so the thing will hit them in the face again.
---
The second job is just as important as the first.
---
Do you enjoy going through the shittiest phase of the game over and over again?  If I could start at level 40 I would; life improves tremendously.
---
That's why I love rogue. Cause I look super badass at level 15-25 with defias armor and mask.
---
Past 4 mobs the tanks are not going to keep aggro off of you. I rather Demo and thunderclap so when aoe dps eventually take aggro on the normal mobs you are more likely to survive and just concentrate on the elites in the group so you dont get killed by them. 
---
Pally tanks may have better luck since it's all undead but warrior tanks especially past 4 good luck on keeping aggro.
---
PROPERTIES OF BOTH RUBBER AND GUM
---
First is in orgrimmar, Ragefire Chasm. Second is in the Barrens, Wailing Caverns.
---
No it gives the threat to whoever was hit.
---
No, not at all, not even debuff effects like Judgement of the Crusader. It's the only exception like that, I believe.
---
I don't understand how a mage &amp; a pally can be rolling on the same item. Either op is wrong about the item and shouldn't be rolling or the pally shouldn't be. In what world does a Mage &amp; holy pally share items? Its spelll dmg verse healing. I guess there are some items that share this stat, which I agree op and fuck the pally. If it's only healing added &amp; he's the healer than yea fine. But if it says spell damage that's legit mage/warlock item or priest, not a fucking holy pally. Spell hit would be dps so not holy pally. Unless it was just like lots of spirit and some intel, then I guess. If it's a lot of spirit then yea holy pally, if it mostly int should have given to mage even if he was the healer IMO. But it is possible it was the perfect inbetween item &amp; the pally only heals dungeons where I could see it. 
---
Just saying its not a black/white area there's a lot of grey. OP didn't provide context but people just saying "yea pally role on whatever" is a shitty jerk practice.
---
There are going to be 10,000 mages LFG and no one is going to want them.
---
You aren't understanding the cross faction restrictions in place. This would only be viable on PvP servers and the only way it could be taken advantage of is if people paid for two accounts.
---
I don't know for certain the answer to question 1 but according to my dps meter the damage from ret aura is tied to the person hit. So if the warrior in the party is hit and it procs the paladin's ret aura it counts as the warrior being the source of damage. No idea for question 2.
---
But... STALKER didn't come out till 2007.
---
The benefit is you get way more targets to slaughter in the name of the alliance
---
I think I've put a bit into both of those. Lately I've been putting most of my points into leveling up my Aspect of the Hawk. I also haven't seen any of the talents below that become available to put points into, so I'm not sure how that all works.
---
Brain deads just want to play what’s meta. Don’t hate on the good mages just cause you’ve had bad experiences with bad players.
---
I've been playing on a 54 inch TV for years now. I could never go back to a small screen.
---
Just remember that the Horde doesn't have Fear Ward, and they are able to do all the raids just fine. Anyone who denies you a Raid spot due to you not wanting to look like a barrel is a meta thumping try-hard.
---
I was too curious to do that lol
---
&gt;he's gathered to create a large ship and he and the trusted members of the Defias are going to become pirates
---
It's much much better than this: He bought an orc juggernaut (it's a big war boat) from the war that resulted in the destruction of Stormwind... To destroy Stormwind again!
---
True, but it's still not worth it, to my play style at least, to go that route just for the running speed when you get travel form at 30.
---
It doesn’t quite do everything this guy is asking for though, it just displays a raw %better or worse. Doesn’t break it down into how it’ll effect your crit % and everything
---
Yep, there are two options for binds for just about everything. I have all the usual marks on numpad 1-4, but skull has the additional bind to the mouse button. So before a pull, I can just go down the list with skull, cross, moon, etc, and then during combat I can move the skull to appropriate targets
---
Yeah i know right? I just automatically know that the tank missed all his threat gainers and stop dpsing in the middle of a mob pack. Or better yet just wait 20 seconds to start dpsing. I use threat and dps addons at level 20 cause i might wipe the whole group if i pull aggro on one mob. /s
---
And on top of that, he knew OP had gone on the building at some point and that’s why he was issued a warning. Further proved by OP who said “even if I was just exploring?”
---
Is this rumor true that if I get to lvl 60 I get a boost in retail ?
---
I heard Spooker Brands exploits blood elf child labor somewhere North of Eastern Plaguelands! And they  import materials from from Gnomes breaking the Horde embargo on the Alliance by masking the sales through pirates in Booty Bay!
---
Boycott Spooker Brands!
---
This whole post seems like r/hailcorporate
---
Cool cool, thanks for the quick response.
---
Spam frost bolt
---
Sounds like a group to avoid
---
I think you should just get the ravager from sm.
---
&gt; No it's not
---
To believe that you have to also believe that 1-30 is less than 12.5% of a character's progress to 60.
---
Is that really a stance that you're willing to take?
---
This is the worst flex
---
4 strength 4 stam leather belt?!
---
Mana bar for Druid while in shape shift forms.
---
Not really, cause a single lv 60 can kite them to the city boss room and death arrives swiftly
---
Yeh like roll all the chests for like 1 hour, then you get a blue and steal?   
---
Yeh thank you missieboy, the ninja thief.
---
This.  Healing will show in the "incoming" box when you configure the layout.
---
I think Vanilla is REALLY important to be played through before TBC is considered. Very few of the players playing today ever got to experience AQ (and the war effort), let alone the Naxx event and the raid that followed.
---
Once we run out the timeline, absolutely if the server would progress to TBC and end there for years, I'd be happy.
---
As we transitioned to WOTLK, things did take a huge nosedive. The raid content was engaging, with hard modes being triggered in Uldar (which was a real big test for guilds), it just wasn't the same anymore.
---
I do agree, TBC was the peak. Classes felt a LOT more balanced, other specs were given new life and the world (before everybody and their mom had epic flying) really did feel ALIVE, even with the necessary evil that was flying. (Due to some areas of zones being out of reach otherwise)
---
Nothing will top Quel'Danas pvp though. Doing your dailies then starting a faction war that would last literally hours was amazing.
---
Agreed. I should change crusader to parry. And replace divine intellect with improved lay on hands.
---
Opening with MF is a waste of mana and fucks your energy pool. You listed 2 finishers, neither of which you use in the average questing fight. Tiger’s fury is a straight up waste of energy outside of raiding. Claw, Rake(but only on high armor targets) and FF is literally the best way to level.
---
Locked chests are lock picking nodes, just as Thorium rocks are mining nodes.
---
I mean...he’s not wrong
---
Damn I read it this year too
---
It's not hate on cleave groups. It's hate on people treating non cleave groups like they are cleave groups. People do cleave groups, then join regular groups and do stupid shit.
---
Has been floating around, have a 60, no new claims as of yet.
---
??? I think you're making shit up. If the group is clowning then they will not get through faster than a normal run that's just a fact. Trust, I have been part of groups where the dps are straight dummies who do nothing but regurgitate spellcleave bs and guess what? It took 2 hours longer than if we had just done a normal run.
---
Slow n steady wins the race (also there isn't a race so y the fuck are you all so impatient and annoying)
---
Yup. Just shit players that wanna do the dungeons in 2, hours like they did 15 years ago, instead of the faster and harder new approach
---
That is exactly what I'm saying. Some groups want it, some groups just want to do it in a traditional way, and it's okay, but it's not general, it depends directly on the group
---
one lbrs run? Even if i didn't need gear, I've been back 10+ times trying to get my UBRS attunment, and still only have a single gem lol
---
What server are you on?
---
Bad dps will always outnumber bad tanks.
---
Want an easy mind numb class go paladin
---
Ah ok, I was just seriously wondering what it was since it had the same model, thanks for the fast replies!
---
You sweet little alliance scrub. Thank you for letting me sacrifice your life over and over again.
---
I would if I was at home and had access to my PC, I know it's somewhere in interface options, if you can get to the page with all the raid frames options it's in there. Same page where you can enable the colors for each class in your frames.
---
just wanted to add. select the tank and hit "f" to assist him (makes you target the tank's target)
---
Seemingly I have a very different understanding of the phrase "looking cool".
---
Mods: “Now this is some high-effort content!”
---
Boring is efficient. The only class where the most efficient way to (straightforward, grinding or questing) level is fairly complex is Warlock.
---
There is no reason to go to Thorium Point as horde. You cannot hearth there and running from badlands is faster than flying
---
If anything, tanking has become more involved since the days of spamming sunder armor. The focus for tanking shifted away from holding aggro and moved towards active mitigation. You have to execute and adapt your offensive rotation  properly in order to have the resources available to manage your defenses while in classic your defenses are more or less automatic and your threat is determined predominantly by RNG and whether or not the DPS feel like throttling their fun.
---
Yeah, how dare he be defiantly foreign! The nerve!
---
Casters would love for vendor delay to be "the literal worst".
---
Unfortunately for us, it is not.
---
The northern farm in Arathi is also extremely popular. So many 30-35 lvl undead mages get annihilated daily by my gnome rogue.

It wasn't to emulate crap Internet, but crap servers that were sluggish at processing things.
---
Max settings for me
---
Alright I will ty for the advice!
---
No one should be equipping boe blues at that level.  Whole group should of needed and sell that shit.   Waste of a boe to equip it...
---
Sounds like he ninjad it though.  But at the same time, the whole group should of needed it anyway. Because BOEs...  So idk.
---
Lack of offers to polymorph really rankle me.  I get that we can clear the dungeon without it.  Not using it and then mixing single target and AOE dps makes me a sad healer.
---
That and I've yet to see a mage decurse without being asked.  SFK and SM GY have nasty curses but gotta get that sweet, sweet dps.  Times like this I want a paladin tank.  So he won't bitch about my bubble interfering with his rage when he has a -75% healing curse on...
---
Go to a junkyard and get a CRT.
---
Then he should have rolled a warrior, if he wants to do the pulling and face tanking.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Thanks for playing.
---
hahaha
---
I think this is awesome. I am basically about to start the same thing, have been bouncing around a few servers since launch deciding where I wanna play. I have like 3 Nelfs a human and 2 dwarves ready to roll tonight when I get off lol. What are most of your character's races?
---
I’ve never paid attention to the mana restore critting, but I have seen the shadow damage crit 200 instead of 100
---
It is the Torch of Retribution.
---
It stops the window from popping up.
---
Drives me nuts when someone pulls aggro, continues dpsing them (furthering their aggro) and then doesnt run towards the tank, making it impossible to taunt. Just simple things would make runs go super smoothly
---
I meant to say fixed or removed XD
---
He can just buy a normal epic mount. The level 40 free mounts are pretty much objectively better. Due to saving 90 gold when gold is most valuable and saving the bag space when bag space is most limited.
---
So you spend running dungeons that you outlevel before 40? Does not compute.
---
Ya I was in lfg chat and was asking for rfk and I got “rfk?” As a response. So I said “razorfen kraul”... I got the response back “ya?” So I asked if he was confused what the acronym meant or if he didn’t know what it was. I got the response “I need 1 dps”. I literally laughed out loud cause of the confusion this guy caused
---
Extreme ranges were pretty much wallhacks though, which is why they fixed it.
---
I would have respected him for having the balls to say it.
---
That’s something I’m coming to enjoy about tanking. You’re in the most demand, so you can throw your weight around a bit. That rogue that was pulling before me in Uldaman yesterday? I asked the group how much we need the rogue, since we could replace him really quickly. He stopped pulling. 
---
I don’t like being a dick, but the tank is kinda in charge for a reason. If I don’t like a fight, a pull, a path, whatever, that matters, because if the tanking gets fucked up, we all die.
---
It literally costs mana.
---
I play maxed out but it's all about preference. Nostalgia is for sure a factor in why I started playing again but the gameplay is why I continue to play. If it's all about nostalgia then sure playing with old graphics may be better but for me it would probably make me enjoy the game less.
---
If you want a chill group get a sham for wf totem and some rogues
---
Like /u/resistentalist pointed out you want to macro F1-F5. I also like expanding it Shift F1-F5 if things get more difficult. The design of the keyboard plays a large role in how effective you are going to be.  
---
You want it to look like this: [https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/024/984/187/1da48708fa3c69b2126023613577145a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;crop=faces&amp;w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;fit=crop&amp;v=1556765045&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=c2459780f11b13d4d34eeb05435cb957] or get a laptop where it's already compact. Having a [distance](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0549/2681/products/mechanical-keyboard-the-glorious-gmmk-1.jpg?v=1538678567) between the buttons isn't good at all. Now for the regular noob this isn't an issue.  
---
Here are some suggestions most already mentioned:  
---
§  
---
Q, E, R, T, F, G, V (Possibly Shift § Q, E, R, T, F, G, V ).  
---
1-6  
---
Shift 1-6  
---
F1-F5  
---
Shift F1-F5  
---
Mousewheel up, Mousewheel down, Mousebutton.  
---
Now this mostly effects healers, heck I even used the [one-button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnoOnmW-0Bs) macro on my hunter during TBC. Wasn't that much more difficult during Vanilla.  
---
Biggest issue I had was to remember dismissing the pet and buying ammo. I suggest you do this at around level 45-50 because then you have almost all abilities and it takes some getting used to the keybindings and macros. Because you don't want to be the one pressing the wrong buttons in Molten Core, but nobody bats an eye if it happens in Mauradon.
---
/r/boneappletea
---
I heal,  I know.  Real annoying though :0
---
They literally said they didn't save a non frost damage wand...
---
Your current self has been conditioned to crave constant incremental upgrades to satisfy the addiction you've developed to Retail's loot shower.
---
Thanks for the detail. Any pet recommendation? Do my pet or myself need shadow resistance?
---
Not sure if self aware
---
Yo protadin aoe grinding is the bomb. And it's shiny.
---
Fuck the horde 🤘🏼
---
Tell that to a rogue trying to find a 5 man dungeon group. No one wants a rogue in their 5 man when even non cleave groups are still aoeing every pull.
---
But not every class needs as many as a hunter. Matter of fact no class does.
---
You're either on team "everyone greed unless you're gonna equip it" 
---
Or you're on team "need all the boes because selling them is much more valuable" 
---
  And il tell you right now. The guy who greeds the boe is going to lose that battle.
---
it counts as a castable like the shamans ghost wolf.. it costs mana.. so it breaks your 5 second regen ontop of being able to be interrupted and all the other fun stuff that comes with it being a spell instead of a true mount.
---
I am 47 and still just rocking my ghost wolf.. but I have maxed LW so theres that...
---
Wire it through a toaster into an old TV from no later than 2000 and no larger than 24". Any other setup and you're a dirty casual.
---
Well that's good =)
---
That makes sense ! Well dungeons will be your best bet then ! Snap up all the quest for those dungeons and farm them out whatever ones are relevant for your level. So right now that’s BFD, stocks, sfk. Wow head has a list of all the quest for each faction and how to obtain them. Between the three dungeons and quests you’ll get some nice loot. :)
---
I literally pickpocket any chance I get. Going through a dungeon? Pickpocketing the mobs before I start dosing (I justify it by saying I'm letting my tank build threat). Out in the world? These disgusting humans have pockets, better take some of that money. Yetis? Well, if naga can have pockets--shit.
---
Fuck yetis. 
---
p.s. getting lockboxes to up my lockpicking is also a nice bonus.
---
I play on a 4K Asus monitor and GTX2080. The more immersive the better it is for me. Even at that resolution still feel the same way you do right now. Everyone’s still very helpful on our realm. Earthfury
---
I think it’s fun. I want my faction to hit 60s before the other one.
---
&gt; You have to hold shift, not just shift-rmb and let go. If you let go of shift before the loot window opens, it'll auto loot.
---
Ah, will try it like that
---
&gt;skuzzie
---
While there can be some casual players that raid hardcore, most casual players either don't want the kind of stress that "progression" guilds tackle (full consumables on each pull, pre BIS every phase, reputation grinding for specific items) or they can't make the times that most hardcore guilds raid at (because of school/work/family obligations). These people tend to find guilds that raid on nonstandard times which results in getting pugs each week/not enough people as well as people that join the guild with the intent of getting gear and leaving to a better guild. Most of these guilds will not progress past BWL.
---
Only thing I wasnt kidding about was the pickpocketing thing. It's a totally acceptable practice, and a small conciliation prize for rogue's lack of farming proficiency.
---
This is classic. They aren’t adding new features.
---
My regular tank does pretty good since he dropped his shield and respecced fury tank.  If they use a mega thorns set and dynamite they can hold pretty good even on big pulls.
---
Start it maxed out, if you can, and after some hours change it to '3' which is 'classic' setting and see how you get on.
---
&gt;is if people paid for two accounts
---
And you bet your ass there would be a nerd with two accounts brokering deals for a slice of the bounty. 100% Guarantee it 
---
Alao server discords exist
---
&gt;where that's acceptable 
---
That's the key here. Pug guilds need leadership at some point during 3 months...
---
Same, and most of the time I'll just join out of boredom lol
---
Welp here's the math. 
---
1-60 is 4,085,700 XP
---
1-30 is 546,400 
---
That is 13.37%.. so not far off 
---
His 8 characters at 30 opposed to one level 60 is 265,500 XP.. so yes it is technically more XP.
---
However a majority of 0-30 is in fully friendly territory, or vastly friendly. It isn't until 22 to 24 where ganks could happen, and even then rare. If you're playing a PVE, it's even easier.
---
Also 0-30 is only 3 zones tops, and a dungeon. 0-60 requires about 15 zones and 8 dungeons. Traveling alone is probably a quarter of a day played 0 to 60, if not more.
---
0-30 on 8 characters is a joke 1-60 on a single character is very difficult.
---
15 years ago everyone rolled need on BOE Epics. I'd expect them to do the same today.
---
#nochanges
---
I have played a warrior for 10 years. The problem mentioned SOMETIMES happens. But the frequency of these threads far outweighs the existence of the problem. I’m so tired of hearing it.
---
Shot you a dm have a couple questions.
---
It's implementation has changed, as well. Not just timing and priority.
---
Entire DR tables are wrong, loot tables and items are in their post-vanilla state, abilities not functioning properly at all, item bonuses being removed when zoning, skill bonuses not applying - but spell batching, yes, that's perfect! \o/
---
He’s helping them by making it take longer for you to hit 60. Less 60s on other faction means weaker faction
---
Classic is a dumpster fire for mechanics, systems, and itemization. This shouldn't be surprising to anyone. 
---
Holy Paladins can wear cloth and need caster stats.
---
Its more like warlock/mage/mage/healer/mageorwarlock
---
You use void pet you gather the pulls to not take uneeded damage, then blizzard rain of fire
---
Also t3 shoulders
---
I won mine on a 2, the other guy rolled 1 ;D
---
Hobos are there because of costly Northrend campaign, they are victims of Stormwind politics just as VanCleef's masons were. It just so happens that when people's life gets dire, they all flock to Westfall.
---
Haha thank you! Can't wait for 40.
---
Wanted to create similar post... you made my day, my alcoholic friend!
---
I remember being a Guild Master and asking people to be on their main's for the raid. Theres always that guy who gets away with being on an alt, gets an invite from an officer on the downlow, and never lets you know his main character name. Then you find out and are like "come on dude."
---
Wait, so you move your left hand all the way over to the numberpad?
---
I really enjoyed the badlands, i had a nice power spike around 42 with my full spellweave set and spent a day or two switching layers killing horde who thought they could farm my earth elementals.
---
thanks, i didnt know that
---
If your tanking consider making your own groups. Bring nothing but clothies. One of the best ways to ensure that you get the gear you need.
---
Haha good thought!
---
If you're gearing yourself for raid, of course. But some players don't know what BiS even means, let alone which items are BiS, and others would see that and think, yeah, it'll increase my DPS by a bit, but that 100g is 10% is a free mount, or 10% of my epic mount, or enough money to power level a profession to 300.
---
And healer please, I have enough of yelling OOM in their “fast runs” that in any case ends up in wipe orgy
---
You are welcome.
---
Yeah I’m just putting it out there for discussion and all I get are toxic replys smh
---
As in released in the last 10 or so years and doesnt feel incredibly dated. I tried playing Runescape when it was new and it felt ancient even back then.
---
Darnassus is basically a bunch of huts and trees.
---
Congratulations
---
Yay someone on my server and side 😀
---
I chuckle every time I see this in game.  Fools.
---
Yeah people dont realize that the pvp balance overall is heavily horde. All horde pvpers are in for a rude awakening in p3 when the bg queues hit
---
Never needing anyone else for a profession in an MMO is kind of breaking the game. You need  a bolt of wool cloth? Don't have to ask in Trade Chat! Need some leather? Just hop on the druid and skin some for yourself! Need a dungeon done? Just buy 4 more accounts and start multiboxing... What, how did we get here?
---
The best thing is when someone calls out your class for being in-efficient and you end up consistently doing more dps then them.
---
Forgot the names, but all the Horde knew about that Gnome rogue pair and a Night Elf hunter in Nerz'hul during Vanilla-BC. They often came up on the forums, and general chat. Gankers could achieve some renown for their actions.
---
The only reason I got this quest done was with guild help. I couldn't find any randoms, including other warriors, that were willing to help me. 
---
And then I discovered the Corpsemaker, which is almost as good and WAY easier to obtain. And then I discivered the Bonebiter, which is actually BETTER than Whirlwind and also easier to obtain. I'll probably just skip the Whirlwind on my next warrior character. I almost feel like the quest is a big joke in hindsight.
---
Combat spec with Swords is the best for leveling. You can get away with a dagger in the offhand, as fast weapons are good for applying poisons. You might want to find a fast sword instead, though. Especially with 5/5 in Sword Spec in the Combat tree.
---
 That's why I love rouge. Cause I look super badass at age 15-25 with lipstick and eyeliner. 
---
:p
---
If you find yourself running a dungeon with a warrior tank, pop the ret aura for them over the devo one.
---
Devo lowers are rage gen a tad, and yes getting hit with ret aura up helps me maintain threat on everyone.
---
Lol okay thanks for toxic reply. Why should I feel bad again?
---
oh shit what? all i've heard is people saying 3 months max. i hope thats not true, layering needs to go asap, the world feels so empty
---
I would like to buy a million Spooker Brand wands please.
---
No, of course I'm not going to just vendor them for profit. I need them all. For, uh, all the mage alts I'm making.
---
A slow mainhand, like a sword, is usually going to have higher upper end damage, which improves sinister strike damage. Until you get poisons go with whatever in the off hand. Once you do get them I believe you'll usually want a faster offhand for poison application.
---
Thank you for the HunterxHunter reference I love you
---
/tm “#”
---
# = a corresponding number to each target icon.
---
I think “0” = clear the icon altogether.  Play around with it and you’ll get your skull and cross :)
---
I'm on Kirtonos. You don't go near BRD as alliance at certain times of the day
---
Gotcha thanks
---
Nah I’m a dwarf so I get no melee bonuses, I’m not sure if it’s the best but I do way more damage with green axes that’s lvl 34 as opposed to the pole arm from ulda which is a lvl 42 blue. I stack as much agility as I can.
---
There are just as many warriors as mages. Mages just stick out more because of their constant AOE and spell spamming
---
Nothing closeted here;)
---
Hmmm perhaps you are a worthy opponent.... I'll see you on the battlefield.... For the alliance!
---
This was my favorite addon back in the day. Would love to find this
---
But if I or others stand ontop of him or past him and attempt to attack him too, the guards aggro on us.
---
So not getting how it works.
---
Alt+F4 makes every thing in WoW fall away.
---
&gt;Feels good to not need entitled people with god complex thinking they run the show because they can tank.
---
Well, obviously. You're already filling that role.
---
Ret pallys are pretty bad at pve but they absolutely smash faces in pvp if they have enough gear
---
your mom is a pumpkin
---
As a mage I’ll let you gain threat if I really need to or just keep sipping my mana but I slow the targets by 50-60% with a blizzard then freeze and repeat, put on a mana Shield and I’m saving the healer hella mana not healing the tank or me, never had a tank complain once
---
It's my favourite, well a toss up between it and NGE
---
I feel ya there, I absolutely hate the male troll look and I prefer not to roll female troll either. However, if you care about min maxing troll is the way to go for that. Other than that, my preference is usually orc or undead. Happy questing!
---
well now i can use the exe, it was a green axe so its pretty good for me at lvl 9 imo, does 18-27 damadge comparing it to my other weapon that did only 10-15 damadge
---
I’ve been level 32 for 17 hours 😬
---
If interested watch quin69 on twitch, he's been playing ret.  Not great damage in pve  but It'll give you an idea of what it's like
---
That is the quest I am troubled on. I’m constantly on a layer that I’m out numbered. I’m constantly being farmed by Horde (PvP server). I have no problems with the pvp stuff, the quest though, the drop rates are so bad with the lesser earth elementals.
---
A good rouge will go a long way.
---
Nothing closeted here buddy ;)
---
I really pray that they don't force me to quit again with the like back in time.
---
A man sees no skulls.
---
I think Aragorn was one of those.  Them Dunegon Rangers.
---
Winterfall village at like 4 am when the horde wasn't awake
---
Easy killer...
---
I was joking that retail hasn’t needed a threat meter for the better part of a decade.
---
How could you not want to go Kodo? I want one for my undead :D
---
That is really cool!
---
That’s not very Lok’tar of you
---
Disagree. You do you I suppose....
---
There is more than enough hit in even pre raid blues to have DW fury smash slam spec in dps. Only if you are horde would 2hand fury be okay even then you aren't slamming.
---
I dont understand those people. Changes were already made since release so the whole nochanges argument isnt valid. In my opinion i think if they wanted to make changes for a new long term goal, now would be the time. Like an alternate universe of WoW. Say we prevent the portal from opening to outlands this time with a raid or something at the end of phase 6.
---
Yeah, I haven't had a login queue for the first time in a few days. It's been nice.
---
Was in an ubrs where the tank himself wasnt attack what he marked as skull id auto then aimed shot which is like 4 seconds and in that time he had no sunders on the skull
---
4-6 months?! Lol it better out before 2020 or blizz will be losing out on 2 months of subs.
---
I'm never gonna hit 60.....I can't stop making bloody alts :(
---
Can't recommend this video enough. Prot pally in vanilla is so poor compared to both bear tank and warrior that it ceases to be funny and is more just sad.
---
Question about professions/gold making efficiency:
---
What's better (am Warlock): 
---
Taking skinning/herbalism and selling everything until 60 before swapping to tailoring/enchanting or just starting rocking tailoring/enchanting all the way from the beginning?
---
Im 42 now and ill do the same in ZF and BRD until lvl cap. Its more efficient with 4 mages, we dont need a tank sorry about your luck.
---
You guys are honestly just mad were making your classes irrelevant and healers would prefer groups with 4 mages. For speed and fun factor. 
---
And you can keep thinking your pulling 3 mobs at a time takes more skill with a tank.
---
Ill keep thinking you're insane to believe that because it obviously takes more skill to aggro 10+ elites with no tank, while not letting the group hit you, keeping the mass group together and coordinating novas, CoC's and Blizzards. 
---
Yea man 1-3 mobs at a time with a tank taking all aggro while you cast from behind is a lot more skillful 
---
I mean you're gonna need to be resto anyways. The only issue is the annoyance of having to get your fat ass to the dungeons and then have a grp possibly crumble
---
Gotta love messing with people in voice chat by saying “None may challenge The Brotherhood” before the pull. Or going “Lapdogs, All of you!” Out of the blue. For context I have a **spanking** impression of VC.
---
God I wish I put more effort into voice acting.
---
Just wait until Phase 2
---
Questing in ashenvale as alliance is your first mistake.
---
Yikes.
---
You should honestly get them to 35 for that sweet passive income.
---
If you bring me plenty of water I'll gladly waste it by only drinking for a few sec's at a time. Also gotta loot.
---
I'm going to end this concisely, because I don't think you understand what we're debating. 
---
We are in 100% agreement about loot when you're in a group that splits proceeds. If one person wants the item but everyone else wants to share the gold, then it's not selfish for those people to roll need, sell the item, and then share the gold. 
---
I've never been arguing for or against anything that pertains to rolling for loot in a group in which you share profits, or in which you are an actual group that plays together frequently. You keep bringing that up as support for your opinion, but it's moot. That's not the scenario that I'm arguing about. 
---
The scenario I'm arguing about is when you're in a group of strangers that doesn't play together. Loot received in such a group does not result in the benefit of the group; it goes to the winner of the roll, and then you never play with that group again. This is the only instance/scenario that I'm arguing about. Of course things are different in consistent groups, guilds, etc. 
---
However, we are in a disagreement in the scenario I'm referring to: when only one person benefits from receiving the item. I think, if there's no profit sharing, the people who will use the item should get priority over a person who will sell the item. The loot system in place in the game facilitates that. That's the design of the game and the intention of the loot system. 
---
If you roll need against someone who needs the item, and you win, sell it, and keep the gold for yourself, that's selfish/ninja looting. It's more selfish than rolling need and using the item. 
---
You're allowed to form all the opinions you want. What I'm saying is, it's not fair to decide that someone needs an item less than you need the gold that could come from that item in a scenario where only one person is benefiting. The way the loot system is designed dictates where priority to roll comes from. If you choose to ignore that, that's fine, but my point is that it's selfish. 
---
If the item received only benefits one person (whether by being equipped or sold, i.e. you're playing with strangers and you aren't a group that plays together, just a pick up game for a dungeon or quest or whatever), then anyone who will use the item should roll need and anyone who will sell the item should roll greed.
---
It's just the definition of the need/greed system, it's not complicated.
---
Larger mana pools and higher Crit (for mana refund) also plays a part in it. 290 mana per cast vs 410 is a huge difference in the amount of spells you can cast without going oom.
---
&gt; anyone that knows their class well enough should know how to disassemble other classes
---
Exactly! And my argument is that a good pvp paladin should have a statistical advantage vs rogues in a 1vs1.
---
To be fair, I’m thinking of late game well geared paladins vs well geared rogues. You could very well be right in your assessment that rogues beat paladins when both are in blues, though I doubt that as well.
---
When I say good pvp paladin I’m talking someone with engineering, as many potions as you have, and a good pvp spec. Both Ret and Reckoning should have ways to melt a rogue both before and after pvp trinkets, but it’s not 100% ofc.
---
I suck at this game so take what I say with a grain of salt.
---
It's my understanding that as a Warrior Spirit is a highly underrated leveling stat. At least early levels.
---
Stamina only increases the threshold of damage you take before you die. It doesn't decrease the time you spend in a fight, and it doesn't decrease the time you spend recovering. From an efficiency perspective, Stamina doesn't do much. (I get that out in the world questing, having high Stamina will sometimes save your life.) 
---
Strength increases the damage you do. So it decreases the amount of time you spend in each fight, thereby saving how much damage you take. From an efficiency perspective, Strength is a good stat.
---
Spirit increases your health regeneration rate. As so as combat ends, Spirit starts doing its work, reducing the amount of time before you can jump back in combat. Spirit reduces your down time, making it an efficient stat.
---
So stacking Strength and Spirit, in theory, is supposed to reduce the damage you take in combat by killing stuff faster and reduce your down time by regenerating faster. This is all just in the perfect scenario and obviously changes with practical use. Also I suck at this game so destroy me if I'm spreading misinformation.
---
Do I need to be Holy Spec Paladin to heal (effectively) in dungeons and raids? It seems there are some *nice* but not *mandatory* talents in holy (+Spell crit chance, +12% healing power, guaranteed crit every 3 minutes, refund on mana in crit, and holy shock). But I think if I simply have a Healing gear set and spec Ret (for soloing, pvp), I can still be effective enough to clear content. What do you a think?
---
Obviously not considering that everyone keeps running into brain dead mages that are doing shit that fucks up the group
---
Works fine in BRD
---
Too many times I've been tanking recently, only to have a mage or hunter decide to start pulling ahead of me for no good reason. 
---
We were halfway through SFK, going swimmingly, when the mage just started running ahead and frostbolting new mobs. Like ??? I'm slowing down because our priest has maybe 10% mana, don't do this to me bro. Gave me shit for complaining, so I kicked the fool.
---
SMH this is like every 2-3 runs I find people like this, it's terrible.
---
Am I being wooshed? It absolutely is a fair comparison. Just like level 91 is 50% of the way to level 99 in Runescape.
---
My research concluded the same thing which is why I'll definitely be going SM ruin once I hit 60. So far at level 44 deep into aff tree the account is already godly at PVP. Would be interested to see a veterans response to this though!
---
I feel like they should make an alternate universe with this classic wow now that we are back at the start. Like in my other comment i said end phase 6 with a raid to stop the dark portal from opening.
---
He probably got attacked a lot since we all kinda look the same for certain classes in the same gear haha . I saw quite a few undead female spriests and a few attacked me,they had some friends that kept rezzing and killing alliance who walked past on the road.  Later, I thought it was the same spriest, because they tried to MC me, apparently they just wanted to stam buff me so I kept stopping them thinking they just wanted to attack me. I kinda felt bad for openly attacking a previous priest because I think they just wanted to buff me as well.
---
I actually just learned this is a thing the other day after playing this game. Makes mass crafting way easier.
---
Obviously. You missed the question.  Does the nature damage scale with spell power.
---
Did you really just "sweet summer child" me? You got me good with that classic reddit response!
---
Username checks out.
---
Stop that.
---
Delete this.
---
Obligatory thanks for the gold!
---
👍
---
Yeah because the horde don’t do the exact same thing *eye roll*
---
Multiboxer
---
Thanks man! Will try tomorrow
---
"We know that. Where has it gone to?"
---
I laughed. For real.
---
Yep was thinking the same.  Only time a hunter is easy is if he sends his pet in wayy to early or if he starts to close.
---
A good example: In original Vanilla WoW they planned to release Karazhan... this plan was scrapped as they decided to release the first explanation TBC with Kara included in it.
---
Classic+ would likely include a lvl 60 version of Karazhan and the other things that were meant to be in Vanilla.
---
&gt;Ret pallys are very good when leveling
---
For survivability yeah, but theyre pretty well known as the slowest, most boring class.
---
A chance at a minor stun is not worth giving up a chance for an entirely free attack that can crit and/or proc other shit.
---
Mace spec is maybe better than axe spec for pvp. Sword spec is so much better than both it's not even close.
---
Skittish weeks are still fun.
---
Was he master looting or did he still have faith in humanity? :)
---
Judgement of justice is purely PvE in classic.  Stops NPCs from fleeing and that’s it.
---
Yes, because I just went from playing the game with a faction ratio I dont care about to sitting in queue.
---
No problem man
---
Agreed, you should never roll need on an item you’re going to vendor!
---
You probably cant join a guild and instantly become the main tank when you are this far behind - if that is your question.
---
The most fair way to handle BoE epics is to all roll need. If someone in the party actually wants the item to equip, they have first dibs at purchasing it from the winner at a fair market price. This is how I handle valuable drops in my groups and I haven't had any complaints.
---
all i'm thinking about is the xp waste from that wall of text...
---
here's the secret to leveling - just keep killing mobs
---
gabe
---
Do I need a gathering profession to get enough gold for a mount at lvl 40?  I’m 13 now and like grinding the quests, prefer not to spend time on professions if I don’t need to, but the mount is more important to me.
---
&gt;Overall the population is growing according to Blizzard
---
where
---
how do these numbers change?
---
originally fairbanks was 33k(horde)-32k then it went down to 33k-~27k -&gt; i assumed this was due to server transfers but now 1 week later alliance is down to 20k. No way 7k people transferred off in 1 week way after the transfers opened?
---
This idea will spark massive backlash from players who will claim that blizzard is forcing its will upon them
---
No u
---
Are you going to a more authentic vanilla thing with the UI scale and resolution?
---
Agreed! On Saturday, in the same day, I tanked, DPS'd, and healed RFD. It's so much fun being a Druid - just find some gear that fits with your different classes, and you can be anything you want.
---
Blizzard runs integrity checks on game files, you'll need an add-on in order to do this, changing the files will either force a reinstall or could even potentially result in a ban.
---
The cause is. The means to construct a giant ship fortress and destroying Stormwind and killing everyone inside, civilians included, isn't.
---
Exactly what i was thinking lol. And title edit "The Asmoncucks of Faerlina come together to continue their cuck fantasies and spoon feed their hollow and corrupt idol while he gets rich IRL."
---
Dude, not being effective at your job by doing the expected (your rotation suggestions) is what makes tanking so hard.  
---
I can't believe you are even debating this.   Press literally one button as a mage and you will do wonderful.  Go into a dungeon underleveled as a tank and hate your life.  Do it as a DPS no one will notice or care. 
---
Tanking is objectively the most difficult and taxing job in dungeon content.  Its okay to admit that, no need to use double speak (frustrating, not effective) to protect your ego
---
NEXT!
---
I played an alliance lock in vanilla, never occurred to me until you mentioned it that there's no trainer in all of kalimdor... that's a scary thought.
---
It costs you way more than 100 mana when you consider the lost mana regen, that's the point.
---
Right?!? I will as going to say this same thing. I'm a troll shaman and this reply is a bug times from me dawg.
---
How do I look for a dungeon group when I’m a total noob? 
---
I’ve never played wow before, so I have no idea about all the tricks of these dungeons. I tried SFK last night, only to get the party killed at the part with the silencing ghosts. I’m an undead priest btw. 
---
I don’t want to advertise that I’m a noob cause then I’ll never find a group, but I don’t want to drag down people who don’t want to dra with my inexperience and slowness. I got flamed a few times for that already. 
---
It’s also hard finding appropriate levels, because I do t really want to get carried through, and I don’t want to have to get carried either. 
---
Any suggestions on how I can find appropriate, noob friendly groups?
---
Exactly, so it doesn't only cost him 100 mana.
---
I checked for the LOLZ and gold is REALLY expensive now. I think 100g was over $200 when I checked.
---
No, everyones bitching and im responding. 
---
This is like the 3rd thread this week and its only tuesday saying "OMGMAGESRUINMYLIFE" 
---
Like shut the fuck up dude, good mages dont even need a tank thats a fact. And were obviously not referring to raids here genius, were referring to lvling dungeons. Did OP mention NAXX? 
---
No you just brought it up to jump in and seem relevant "LOL HAVE FUN RAIDING NAXX LOLOL"
---
Youre so smart bro how did you thin k of that sick burn. Dumbass motherfuckers. Dont come at me and i wont be toxic to you.
---
I don't think this is correct, take it with a grain of salt. 
---
To the topic at hand: class does not affect your droprate.
---
But you literally need a taunt to tank in raids. Also, they are missing alot. Not just a taunt. 
---
Warriors can: 
---
- become uncrushable
---
- reduce 75% damage w shield wall
---
- hit over 20 k hp in end game with last stand and lifegiving gem.
---
- Three taunts
---
- Can pop powerful dps cooldowns to massively boost threat even in full tank gear. I have never seen a pally hold  single target aggro over top tier dps players.
---
- Get solid tanking gear from tier that paladin simply cant match
---
- fight forever without breaks
---
- Scale insanely with gear
---
Gotta be a chain heal, right?
---
True, guess you could just que up with guildies. But a whole other feature, idk could be cool. Obviously this is just a general idea, no detail.
---
looks for guild on reddit... doesn't mention faction...
---
FB is not worth the energy unless you’re at 5 combo points, unless you have the FB talent which nobody takes for leveling because it’s wildly suboptimal. If your rips are lasting long enough to be worth their cost, you’re already so far out of a decent ttk that it really doesn’t matter what skills you use. 
---
In order for tiger’s fury to do more damage than a normal claw, let alone a crit, you’d need to not only tick it perfectly, but land every single attack made in its window. You seemly either wildly misinformed and inexperienced or more likely, you go through scenarios with BCSM
---
Pre-endgame PvE, DW is bad, was my point, and one I'm sticking to.
---
In cases like this the tank sometimes takes too long to pull. When I tanked on my druid to 60, I would pull when dps and heals are at 60-70% mana and tell them to continue drinking while I get threat. You're wasting dps uptime if you wait till everyone is full mana to pull, which can make dungeons like 10-20 min slower for no good reason
---
Did they burn down the 4th giant tree yet?  Are there 1337 different playable races?
---
ItemRack.  Can even set events to equip a specific set when you join a group, or are swimming, or walk into a city/rested area.  It’s very versatile.
---
Bleeping correct. Walking all across Azeroth the past month has not been fun..
---
Ok honestly go prot like, right now. Spec down to holy shield and then dump points into Holy for concecration. 
---
At 60 just grind your dick off in the plague lands making mad stacks of money off of cloth, mining or herbs (Target the undead and humanoid mobs as much as possible. 
---
At 60 you CAN tank dungeons just fine. You're gonna wanna focus rolls on the ret shit you want and steal it from any warrior or Hunter who gives you shit about it.
---
Great response thanks
---
My experience some of the faction imbalancing has to do with the level ranges. Less people of a certain level makes the game seem dead to people of that level, but other zones might be full to the brim, while others are are dead due to population spread.
---
Roll Alliance on Netherwind.  It is a very balanced server that favors Alliance slightly.
---
My main was an alliance mage. But I had a 60 horde shaman on an alt server that I pvp’d on a fair bit (rank 12 in honor system). I also dabbled in end game raids on my shaman, but in a casual guild. On alliance side I was on a hardcore server first raid guild. 
---
The horde questing and dungeon grind experience is better. No question about it. Dungeons are better located. Various leveling zones are easier to get to. And windfury makes damage output for melee groups do much better. The horde also has better pvp racial abilities. For all of this horde is better. 
---
For vanilla raiding before Naxx, alliance are better located. Horde does not have quick access to black rock mountain. Most horde set their Hearth to Kargath. Alliance can set their hearth with much more flexibility as black rock mountain is very close to its hubs. For molten core and black wing lair, alliance have a geographical advantage. 
---
Alliance also have an easier time with threat management in raids. Blessing of salvation is huge. And pally buffs are not limited range. Shaman totems don’t apply raid wide and have limited range. Pally buffs can be spread to the entire raid (not just party paladin is in) and has no range restrictions other than when casting it. 
---
Overall, alliance has the edge in end game PvE. Horde has the advantage everywhere else (pvp and early game PvE and dungeons as WF&gt; salvation for dungeons).
---
Also, aoe clearing comps generally dont have a real tank. 3mages 1 lock 1 priest.
---
Those are basically *the* two runs.  Sometimes skipping golem if the run takes 12 minutes and you dont need anything from golem.
---
I've never seen any run that goes to the vault, or the brewery area or the spirits before the lyceum unless doing a full run.
---
The infamous World of Roguecraft videos feature a Rogue murdering high-ranked Alliance with nothing but the starting dagger.
---
A link to what?
---
I prefer tanks that get heavy dps so you they can actually hold threat
---
My "condescending attitude" towards changing stances?? for an ability that has already been proven to be weaker for AoE threat by several abilities that doesn't require doing so? What are you going on about?
---
&gt;Farming BRD/MC/Ony for another 4 months probably won’t feel very good for most players
---
Most players aren't even level 60 yet let alone level 60 farming MC.
---
Then you are forgetting what vanilla was like. Drop rates are really low in vanilla. Even doing a full clear of a raid you don't get that many items.  You won't have weeks of your raid being entirely geared waiting for the next raid to come out. In vanilla you were generally still clearing at least 1 raid before the current tier. If you were doing BWL you were probably also doing MC; if you were doing AQ you were also doing BWL. Vanilla 40 man raids drop less gear than later expansion 20man raids did. That’s not even accounting for the fact that it’s actual gear and not tokens. If you get paladin pants 6 weeks in a row but don’t have a 6th paladin, those are getting DEed even if no other class has had pants drop.
---
Let’s also not forget that raids often had gear that required stuff from other raids. From T2 pieces spanned across MC/BWL/Ony to thunderfury and qiraj regalia requiring elementium from BWL.
---
Screw Farming MC/Ony for 4 months. Farming MC/Ony for 8+ months was not uncommon.
---
Oh god. What's wrong with you.
---
Battleshout also generates rage. I tend to pull bloodrage, and battleshout for a good start. Then go zerkerstance pop the fear immunity, gain extra rage while I'm being hit and then sit in defensive stance. Sounds like a lot to do, but if your dps hold for a bit it gives you a huge lead on your dps who shouldn't be starting for a little.
---
AFAIK, players need to run the addon then submit theirs Census file to the site. But it's not working anymore
---
Word, thanks for the heads up. Are you aware of any killstreaks addons? Thinking ahead to BGs, I wanna hear M-m-m-monster Kill!
---
Dunes be gon
---
I hear you.  And admittedly all I have to go on is anecdotal evidence here.  But I can say for a fact that 100% of the time the group listens to me and I pull at my own pace, we have full-cleared whatever we were running  --  Sunken Temple, BRD, you name it.  100% of the time there's been some know-it-all who wants me to speed up, mistakes have been made resulting in wipes and occasionally groups falling apart entirely.
---
Maybe try a different type of server.  I was forced to roll on the RP PVE server because of friends and people there are so nice.
---
Why are mages getting so much hate lately? Am I the only one playing a mage that automatically gives water and doesn't try to constantly AOE spam dungeons, and is respectful of others mobs?
---
You can't just do arena, unless you are okay with only doing it 5 times.  You'll hit the lockout timer.
---
Oh, there are bad tanks out there for sure, it just makes it really difficult to know if I'm good or bad based off of the fact that I keep losing aggro on external targets I've been sundering if the aforementioned cases occur.
---
Ah, sadly I am alliance.  Thank you for the offer though!
---
I don't really believe the meta is still developing. What's been dominant in pserver for years is currently dominant in Classic. I don't see that change in a near future.   
---
It's just that I'm legitimately wondering what's more healthy for the game. It really feels like no one wants class rebalance and  if it happens and player start leaving then this is definitely unhealthy. But if you look at the stats ([https://classic.warcraftlogs.com](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com)) the game is in a terrible state balance wise. So I was curious to know the  community opinion now that we actually have Classic data which is more reliable that pserver's. It does seem like this serious imbalance is still observable and now that we know what the future loot looks like we know it won't change.
---
Ret pally represent
---
Mages can blink out of it
---
Druids can poly out of it I think?
---
Rogues you'll miss against anyway so it won't proc regardless.
---
Warlocks will soak the damage.
---
Hunters you won't be in range to hit so it's moot.
---
Priests will laugh at you.
---
Shamans, tremor totem.
---
Paladins, blessings and bubbles.
---
In each of these cases, hitting them multiple times in the same swing will give you a much bigger advantage.
---
I'll piggy back on this.  39 lock with herb/skinning right now and was planning to later drop skinning for alch but have recently debated swapping to either herb/tailoring right now or dropping both for tail/ench. 
---
I worry tailoring won't be worthwhile when I could just get stuff from dungeons/AH.  Are the BOP items THAT much better than non?
---
How would this fix the issue of too many horde?  It’s not like some servers are too many horde and some are too many ally.  It’s universally unbalanced in favor of the horde.  Where would all these horde PVP players go?  A server that only has horde?  I think the issue is that more people want to play horde.
---
Same, even in Desolace during late evening I was able to form groups just randomly while questing. Harder after midnight but there are still groups forming.
---
Found the gnome
---
Skeram has 70/30 currently. That would be a 40% faction imbalance, which would result in 8% less damage taken and 8% more gold gained for the Alliance. It absolutely does not help when you are getting ganked and slaughtered 5v1.
---
But when going with a buddy and you run in to 3 horde, 8% dmg reduction will help a lot in a 2v3, its pretty huge actually. 8% gold gain will also help a lot in getting gear, mounts, etc. 
---
Overall this buff combined with faction queues or some other solution will slowly stem the bleeding of alliance, and help adjust the balance. Will it 100% fix it? Probably not, but any edge given to Alliance will help them stabilize the pops.
---
Way lower queues than 2-3 weeks ago + less layers = drastic population drop.   
---
What is important is that starting number of players was extremaly high so even after drastic drop there are still tons of players playing the game
---
This person just hit 30 with every class and here I am level 28 on one character and 25 on another.
---
Da fuk?
---
Is there a quest available to kill  Stitches?
---
You’re damn right.
---
I mean but for that you would also have to take into account time to kill and downtime (drinking). You kill shit waaaay faster 1 through 30 and have to eat less as regen is higher and have way way waaaaay less downtime. Honestly I agree that 1 through 30 is a joke
---
That's not how it works in WoW.  In games like Runescape (I'll use Diablo 2 as an example since I never played RS) you grind the same mobs regardless of level (Hell throne room/Baal).  In WoW you essentially have leveling restrictions that prevents you from farming the high level zones so the mobs and quests end up being relatively consistent in terms of % of a level per kill/quest.  So at level 10 a quest might be worth 200xp and give 5% of the 4000xp you need to level.  At 45 you may need 40,000 xp to level but the quests you get give 2000xp so you still end up getting about 5% of your level per quest.  It doesn't scale exactly like that, you definitely need to do more at the higher levels but it still stays relatively consistent.
---
If your wrist is hurting then stop spamming it. You need to press it once every 4 seconds and you have up to 7.99 seconds of extra time before you have to press it to actually lose damage (your energy bar filling up completely).
---
You're already ahead of the others simply because you're actually thinking about other people and how your gameplay can affect others gameplay
---
What happens when someone actually needs the epic?
---
All my groups have had a chat before rolling and generally, we have given it as an upgrade. 
---
Except one time where edge masters dropped and we all agreed to need regardless of the warrior in our group
---
Doesn’t bloodfury reduce incoming healing?
---
Thrall's secret farm?
---
100% agreed. And this is a concept I've had trouble explaining to people. I'm sorry that you want 3 more dps for 2 levels until you get an upgrade from a quest anyway. Makes much more sense for everyone to have a fair roll so they can sell for mount money. BoPs and greens are a different story obviously.
---
Thank you ! I actually needed to hear this.
---
it’s almost like it’s a hybrid class...
---
Ok, first issue with Command while leveling is that Seal and white hit can miss/dodge/parry/crit independently from each other but seal requires the white attack to hit. End result is that some mobs die after 2mins of parries without a single procc and others die in two hits due to crit white with crit SoC procc.
---
One simple solution is just limiting yourself to green quests + enemies. Another option is getting +hit. At your position only hit available is found in prot (3%) or a fairly expensive BOE weapon from AH that is also one of the BIS for hunters due to its hitrating.
---
Second option is to use seal twisting. Google it. In short its switching between Seal of the Crusader Rank 1 and Seal of Command to have Command active while your autoattack hits and Crusade while your swingtimer resets. 
---
Other option would be to go full heal or prot and dungeon yourself to 60. 
---
AOE farming build is also an option murdering 8+ mobs and then drinking/eating yourself back to full.
---
Do you know which of them are / aren't available?  And which will apparently grant you suspensions for gaining entry to?
---
&gt; the lifetime of my paladin will be longer than a Mage or hunter.
---
Meaning that as the Phases progress your Paladin will fair better in the meta compared to those two?
---
Any thoughts on druids (any/all specs)? Also, do hunters drop off hard in what the later phases will be? I didn't pay too much attention to end game PvE back in the day as a kid, and by the time I was paying attention it was TBC and the highest DPS player I knew personally was a Hunter.
---
This guy fucks
---
Dude quit whining, does it really hurt you that someone is typing to you? Just say "Nah." And move in with your life.
---
You shouldn’t worry about it that much, enjoy classic my man
---
What if the tank isn't as geared as the DPS, and literally can't keep up? What if the gear is level, but the DPS pops all of her cooldowns and burst abilities off the bat? What if the DPS pulls? What if the DPS focuses the wrong target? What if the DPS doesn't talent or use their abilities for threat reduction?
---
The only time that aggro is the tank's fault is if they are simply not doing their rotation properly, or they are attacking the wrong target. But seeing as the tank is generally the one designating the targets, that second issue will rarely occur. And do we even want to talk about scenarios where players don't know how to do their rotation?
---
Point is, losing aggro is almost always not the tank's fault. The WotLK changes to aggro enabled *DPS* to be dumber far more than it did *tanks*.
---
For sure, as a whole there i definitely think classic is a better game but I had a blast playing legion as well after not playing since TBC. It didn't feel like the same game as vanilla, but it was still fun in its own way.
---
I work with OP, Bering Sea we have very spotty KVH Satellite internet. Enough to wait 5 minutes for Reddit pages to load and message family/friends - OP Just got to shipyard in Oregon and is hot-spotting his phone (not an option in Dutch due to very poor/no cell service)
---
I have the omen 870 or something like that which runs the game beautifully, but I know that’s probably overpriced for the specs (I just didn’t know how to build a comp). Honestly any half decent rig should run the game nicely considering how old it is
---
That's some quality r/oldpeoplefacebook material right there.
---
That's because you could double up procs with stormherald. It was super broken, you'd keep people stunned half the time.
---
I was able to buy my mount at 40 and I didn’t use any gathering professions. Just save all your gold and only buy skills that you actually need/use. Sell greens and loot everything. You will be fine.
---
There are a couple that do this.  Google should give you a few results.
---
Isn't that from an old Twilight Zone episode?
---
I would strongly recommend against using backstab for leveling. You cannot backstab from the front of a mob, and every NPC will always be facing you 1v1.
---
I would grab a slower weapon (of equivalent DPS) and using SS
---
Do you feel that chill running up your spine?
---
I thought it was the directional shadow in the shade.
---
I'm 47 (almost 48) with almost 8 days played.  I'd say it took me 3-4 days to hit 30 (but I'm taking it slow).
---
I never really run out of mana during MC if I do everything correctly and prepare. Make sure to have mana pots (superior are fine, no need for major). Use your mana crystals and not just the highest rank - before raid I make 3 highest crystals to use, and I remake the 2 highest ones during the raid if I have used them already and have downtime. Another big thing is Argent Dawn rep food, it's a lot better than the crafted water and if you need mana fast, it will deliver. And lastly make a lot of crafted water before the raid and use it literally any time you can. You can even get into the batch timing so you drink-run for a bit-drink-run etc. If you do this and dont waste mana for no reason, you should be fine in MC no matter what.
---
Yes, please. So much waiting around doing Jed runs and no one knows when the lockout will be up.
---
&gt; for an ability that has already been proven to be weaker for AoE threat by several abilities that doesn't require doing so?
---
This, right here. This assumption. This is exactly what I mean.
---
Tactical Mastery is highly valued by literally everyone else. There might just be reasons for that. But based on the quote, you have this assumption that there is exactly one reason to ever swap out of Defensive Stance, and that alone is a flawed assumption.
---
But let's say you don't assume that, because you will automatically take that stand to spite me. Let's say you don't, then answer me this: Why did you ignore the four abilities I listed, all of which have valid uses mid-pull? Why do you also ignore that, by not having TM, you're throwing away all the rage you generate with your initial Charge? 
---
You absolutely have a condescending attitude towards being out of Defensive Stance, you just don't feel you do, and don't want to accept that your own actions prove it.
---
Idk, I’ve played since a few weeks after Vanilla release and every group I’ve ever been in has operated this way- the potential gain to everyone is GIGANTIC if you get a boe epic, not just those who can equip it. It’s always been that everyone needs. That honestly may have been something that my server did and other servers developed their own system.
---
Hey mate. Sadly, fan art prints can't be a thing without risking a cease and decist letter, or even worse, getting sued. Best options are to order a commission and print it at your local print center. But sadly, at the moment, since I'm overwhelmed by work from past commissions + patron rewards + a classic series + comic book concept, I temporarily closed private commissions. Maybe in october.
---
My friend from work convinced me to roll a character on their server but they're already 60 and raiding. He wants to help me level, but we aren't sure what the best way to go is with a 60 and a low level like myself.
---
I got to 9 last night, would dungeon runs around my level be good xp like deadlines and so forth? Or is him being 60 going to kill the xp?
---
Someone please photoshop this guy into the cutscene where Arthas enters the throne room and kills his father.
---
When your after ore’s the weight of a hulk, you better be buying Bulk! Bulk ores on your AH now..
---
Well, getting a weapon with high strength gives you more AP which boosts your power much the same any other melee getting a weapon with good damage/dps would.
---
You still benefit the same way, but are sheltered from bad luck on drops.
---
I'm trying to come up with an RP reason to take Engineering on my shaman. Is hard to justify given that tech is often portrayed in WoW as disturbing the harmony of the elements through environmental damage.
---
The best reason I've come up with so far is "machine spirits" which is a well-trodden trope but out of genre.
---
First, I can. Second, to empathize with people with similar experience and learn other's perspective.
---
I posted a relevant experience in a relevant community. So you could've just ignored if you were not interested.
---
Lol I'm trolling
---
Cat and bear are virtually identical talent layouts. The fuck are you doing with your points in a "tank spec" that is somehow damaging your cat play?
---
You only really start to see the two roles differentiate at 60 with gear choices.
---
Why ?
---
Alliance, Thank you. Should have mentioned that.
---
There's really only the Robe of the Void and the Bloodvine Set (BoE, but has a tailoring req, coming out phase 4). Bloodvine is really good, since it has +hit, but Robe of the Void is only like 6 damage more than the BoE robes. Nice, but not necessary.
---
The part that makes it more worth it is the ability to assemble the high level gear for guilds/profit and to make Mooncloth (4 day cooldown).
---
Now i have a shaman lvl 10, damn you :)
---
What's the addon that puts info up top?
---
I'd argue that endgame matters much more considering you will be spending the vast majority of your time at lvl 60.  The leveling inconveniences are something you only have to deal with for a few weeks/months.  The endgame inconveniences are things you have to live with for years.
---
He's just salty someone ninjad him because he wanted to 'be nice.'
---
Interesting. Thanks for the input!
---
Do you know anything about Resto? I'm super torn between playing a Hunter (mostly for PvP) and a Druid (either Feral or Resto). Probably I'll level both, but it'd be nice if I could settle my mind on one to level first.
---
If you guild is nice too you and lets you raid enhance the warriors will probably rage if you don't twist. But immo it's a terribly high mana eater. But theoretically you won't be allowed to SS in raid because debuff limits Soo other than spot healing and flame shocks not alot to spend mana on.
---
I only do it on boss fights sometimes. 
---
And if you aren't in a group with other melee it literally doesn't matter cause you don't have any spell caster totems. 
---
May or may not do it later with resistances totems.
---
But goa/wf twist is the only one anyone cares about. Points in totem mastery is nice for the lowered mana cost thou.
---
Pissing off a majority to please the minority is a fucking terrible plan.
---
It doesn't matter if I am the majority or not.
---
10 man
---
One, or 8 man?
---
ok
---
But what part? There’s 4 parts.
---
&gt; One problem with tanking is you often never see another tank till Raiding so you have nothing to compare yourself with.
---
This is an interesting point. As DPS I (and I assume many others) start a dungeon assuming the tank is as good as the best tanks I've played with. I'm going to start out going hard, because good tanks in the past have been able to handle it.  
---
A lot of tanks don't live up to that and I scale back if it's the case, but I imagine a lot of DPS don't change anything.
---
Hey this is amazing and a great starting point for me, but I’m so new and just have no idea what most of this stuff does that I’m struggling to make it apply to my warlock, what would you suggest I do/ look at to work it out
---
I agree wholeheartedly! Like I said, bad dps are dime a dozen. If you're planning to spam a dungeon for 3-4 hours and a dps is a pain to play with either because he's a doucher or doesn't understand how to execute, you'll get more exp long run just by kicking him and finding a better one. There's always gonna be another, more pleasant or more proficient mage if you accidentally add a bad one
---
Notice me
---
AOE taunt, retal, mid level tanks can ravanger, maybe pop a sapper on the pull, mage can lip during aoe (or BOP if Alliance)
---
I agree that mages can be retarded but it is possible to tank multiple mobs while someone aoes.
---
Again, my original comment was not about aoe tanking but the tanks tps
---
Lol, I agree but you can run straight to the boss and if you are farming for the ring then you need the runs to take around 12 minutes or you’ll hit the instance lock out.
---
Remember the old military mantra slow is smooth and smooth is fast!
---
no I am currently 49 looking to get 60 ASAP.
---
Am I crazy or did we definitely used to 15 man it back in the day?
---
&gt; 100% Agree, if they had started with double the number of all planned server types for name reservation we would not have this issue.
---
We still would. English-PVP had 2 servers at name reservation, they're up to 18 now. Having four wouldn't have made much difference.
---
Full Pepega
---
Ahh. I see, that plus the "Only active characters have been seen in 14 days" - I missed this before because my digital vibrance is too high it blended in with the background gray.
---
I clicked all 4 of the flame things in BRD the other day, not remembering wtf it even did. The healer typed noooooooo.
---
Luckily I only aggroed 2 of the 4 groups first, we drank up and took down the other 2. Actually really glad we had a mage for that one.
---
I felt bad, but I see something I can click I click it.
---
Go to wowhead and look up the dungeons so you will know the encounters. Also look up the class guide so you will know how to use your class.
---
What does that make prot and holy?   Watching grass grow?
---
Small forgiveness given in BRD where there are like 8 dwarves in every goddam pull and they're all the same color as the fucking floor and walls.
---
People coordinate cross faction transactions for pets/ BoEs/ rare trade goods all the time. No one needs 2 accounts.
---
"Hey Discord, I see a 100g bounty was put on my head. Anyone wanna meet up for a quick 50g?"
---
Also, on a PvE server, you can just make another character on the opposite faction and whisper people directly.
---
On that note, how often do you think this feature would get used on PvE servers? Blizz would have to design a new system that wouldn't even see regular use on all the realms.
---
North of Stranglethorn Vietnam Vale as a 40\~ range Alliance is impractical. Spent like 2 hours to finish 3 simple quests there. I have no problem if the opposite player is alone, we even help each other, but every corner there's 5\~8 Horde that inspires this lonely player so he suddenly get the balls to go all ham on me, when the party leaves, he goes insta Lassie again. I know that theres a Zep right at Grom'gol, but even then, Alliance just stick to dungeons at this range to avoid being camped over and over and over, sometimes you can even handle 3v1 if they are a bit lower, but 7x1 is our reality 95% of the cases
---
Make sure that unless you are about to die that your healers do not power word shield you too. It prevents you from building rage.
---
You are free to do that math if you like.
---
"competetive class"
---
KEK
---
Spoker needs to start exporting cross-realm.
---
Blame Blizzard then, they already re-used tier set pieces as quest rewards in the following expansion, well before transmog was a thing.
---
I'm not doing anything at all, rather just having a convo about the conveniences of the horde over the alliance in terms of questing, dungeons and better fps. 
---
I'm sure there are other advantages that the alliance has over the horde as mentioned BRM/Ony to a point, but the many of the horde conveniences or at least from the little I've spent leveling as a horde outweigh the little of the alliance. 
---
Horde don't have to spend 20-30 mins going through the tram to IF, then run through Dun Morogh via the outskirts of Loch Modan, then a long death run through the wetlands just to reach Theramore or Darkshore, a simple blimp ride in their areas allows them to go to the other continent with ease.
---
I tank twin emperors, does that count?
---
I play a high threat class so I know if a tank is doing good TPS.  When I play with good tanks they take pride in not forcing us to throttle dps.
---
His being 60 will kill the XP, and if you try to have him follow you around as you tag mobs, iirc that also kills most of the XP. My advice would be to have him help you with class dungeon/quests that give great rewards, and help you buy giving you gold (for bags, AH gear, mount @ 40, etc)
---
Either it was a setup, or the guy has never PVPd, anyone who has would have at least put one heal on
---
Yeah dude nice belt
---
If you find a nice retirement home there should be a lot of high lvl mobs that are pretty easy to solo. Easy shard farming
---
Are u on thalnos?
---
Meanwhile, the Undead are seemingly unable to handle a group of humans, who, by being human, are highly vulnerable to various plagues, which is not only their weapon of choice but is also something that hasn't had any lore ramifications at this point in the game.
---
The Orcs are equally harried by a couple of centaurs and quilboar.
---
The Trolls can't even take an island back from some tigers.
---
And the Tauren, well. The Tauren are doing all right, but mostly by virtue of being the only adults in the game.
---
They are like that on my server too so now I'm mad and will gank any horde even if they're outnumbered. Fuck em!
---
Monogamously even.
---
I mean it does kill your xp but if he's willing to spam it a billion times you'll get there eventually.
---
an addon that embeds a browser window in the game since I dont have two monitors and itd be nice to be able to glance at what im listening to on youtube/twitch/netflix.

Aggro radius. I don't know if this already exists or if someone mentioned it, but maybe a colored indicator of a boss or mobs aggro radius shown by a ring around their feet. You could add in the same for things like totems and spell aoe. It could be similar to Lucios ability in Overwatch. It could also indicate how far away something is from you in yards.
---
Thank you so much
---
Gotcha thx.
---
Darn, I was hoping this was not the case. Well, if I have to go that deep into the tree for the free heal then I might as well just go full holy and try to build a shockadin gear set.
---
On another note, the only BiS holy gear sets I can find use a mixture of all types of gear (cloth, leather, mail, plate). Are you aware of any lists which use strictly plate? I would like to build the strongest possible set for pvp.
---
Lol could you imagine if Asmongold selected the wrong quest reward on accident and then he goes love the next day and has the corrected reward? There would be a literal nuclear explosion on this subreddit as well as others.
---
lol I've tanked shit for the last sixteen years. Rag when he was new, all the way up through Legion. Top of my guild, best in any raid I've ever ran in. But ok, shitbeard, go off. Please blink into my next mob pull to nova and COC before I can even get a fucking demo out, I'll just let them stay on you and kill your ass before I taunt.
---
Shit tier mage can't even figure out how to play his class with top DPS without pulling mobs. Fucking pathetic.
---
For some people, there is absolutely a race. Sometimes they are racing against themselves. This is what drives them to improve.
---
It's what I enjoy about the mentality behind cleave groups. There is always more high risk high reward stuff you can do (or high risk low reward, lol).
---
It must be the same for everyone then cause on my server it is always "All horde do is gank you 2v1 or 3v1 never 1v1" in general chat... I love it either way
---
And the last line "I'm a healer" sent me. Thank you &lt;3
---
You are a shit role player. What you know and what your characters know aren’t the same things. Get bent over humor nerd.
---
I fucking love your work, please keep it coming!!!
---
Jesus. Shamans aren't very efficient compared to droods
---
True, but at least turn off growl.
---
This sounds like the highest profile heist to me. Go big or go home, as they say.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Yeah, actually I was thinking about Nightfall + totem twisting. Probably the best way I could help the raid. I hope those wars/rogues appreciate it!
---
Ah shame
---
&gt; So why even remain the GM?
---
Because I got a desirable name, I want to sell it in few years.
---
Thx
---
I, too, would like to know this.
---
Hold up hold up hold up. 
---
I’ve been in like 3 threads about this and right now is the first time I’m hearing it articulated exactly this way. This is brilliant. This is my dream for Classic+
---
Now if he can learn to do more then 11 DPS mobs might also hate him.
---
I can't stand the Badlands... no flight path, only one vendor to sell stuff at and no mailbox.  That couple with not having a ton of bag space makes it  a pain in the ass.
---
There are a few things with the talent trees when it comes to the three main hybrid classes that keep them from doing things other than healing, but the biggest issue is that blizzard started designing gear based around what they saw everyone doing early on in the game. To the point where t3 gear for shaman and paladin was solely for healing and the only "offset" for any hybrids was the AQ gear. One of the things TBC did quite well was giving retribution, prot pally, elemental, enhance, and balance more of a real role (or making their role work better) in pve content than just a worse version of better classes. And it didn't really involve too many talent changes either. If only I liked other aspects of that version of the game more.
---
*sad rogue noises*
---
Retgang
---
You don't have to assume everyone is in a "classic VS retail" mindset. I'll grant you that a lot of people are in that mindset so I can see *why* people would assume that. That said, op gave no indication that he was trying to imply retail doesn't have things like this. So I think it's unfair to not only assume that of him but then to go on and call it circle jerking. Maybe the dude just wanted to talk about something he loves in classic.
---
You will need to abandon engineering and pick it up again, but I have heard of someone saying they can't get the quest to pick Gnomish/Goblin, so it may be bugged.
---
I think at least one item requires Goblin/Gnomish engineering, so if you swap you will lose access to that (The Everlook/Gadget teleporters).
---
I'd take the L and reroll tbh. If I didn't it would haunt me every time I looked at my trinkets.
---
Downvoted me, then edited out the bossy-ness. 200IQ move my friend.

I once met a brazilian player that asked us how to go to Angry Storm and we were so confused, until he said he didn't know english and had to translate the place from portuguese. What he meant was "Vento Bravo" which is how the brazilian portuguese version of WoW translates "Stormwind"..
---
I saw this guy last night and thought the exact same thing. I was almost tempted to join, but was an hour into an intense edible and didn't think I could handle SM.
---
Or I'll be in a group that everyone rolls need for items they need and greed for items they intend to sell. Like most people. Toxic man
---
You say this, but the group I was raiding AQ40 and Naxx with would make any DPS that pulled aggro run back. It wasn't overly harsh (and was honestly mostly a source of laughs) - if you pull aggro as DPS you have fucked up and potentially wasted everyone's time on the attempt.
---
Again, threat and dps are RNG related mechanics  Single target or aoe, dps do need to watch their threat, especially this early when most tanks are still gearing.
---
To say that you shouldnt have to throttle in either scenario simply shows you lack understanding of the game.
---
I can rip if I get a windfury on pull before tank has had time to build threat. Doesnt matter how good the tank is.
---
You had a warlock and a priest.
---
Priest shields/renews the warlock, warlock presses Hellfire.
---
Everyone assumed the others knew what was happening.
---
Reduces players to 100% no?
---
Rend isn't battle stance only. Pummel is berserker only and is 10 rage, not 15.
---
Maintaining rage between fights is a tip you only touched on, but it's something I wish I figured out earlier.
---
Warrior abilities are all better at the start of the fight. Sunder, Rend, Sweeping Strikes, etc. are great if you can get full value at the start, and terrible when the enemy is low.
---
The key is to coast the last part of each fight so you can conserve 50+ rage and open with a burst of abilities to start the next fight.
---
It's a good habit to be in, and even more important when tanking for groups. It's easy to get into a death spiral where dps pulls aggro, but you have no rage so you can't get aggro, so you take no damage, so you get no rage.... If you start each fight with a bank of 50 rage in battle stance, you can start with a sweeping strikes+ whirlwind to lock aggro on.
---
Is it fun for you to be condescending?
---
.....right.....
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqSclLcbvCA Romance version is my fav. So outrun.
---
Can you tell me what the best remedy for diaper rash is? Also, how do you survive when you are not in your parent's basement?
---
I like when i get asked for stuff but i dont like when they call me a aoe grind speedrun asshole because i am a nice guy.
---
To add to this, you generally want to go gnomish -&gt; goblin, not the other way around; since gnomish has more weird items you only need to make once and goblin has more consumables you'll want to repeatedly craft.
---
Dont forget!
---
Give water to your poor healer. Was in a dungeon yesterday 2 mages in my party I asked nicely if I could get some water and was met with a resounding by your own supplies priest.. So I didn't heal them till 1 died then they gave me a bunch of water and said sorry.
---
I put the fun in funeral.
---
Best scripted pserver ever....
---
Yeah man! I'm super salty I'm not playing Classic the same way I've been playing Retail for the past 10 years-- AOEing everything to death and rushing my way through every last fucking thing.
---
Enjoy!
---
Could you be any more obtuse?
---
A bit different analogies.
---
With my cousin I have a physical advantage in the case of ganking a lower level, you have an advantage by levels that is equivalent to being physically stronger. You hit harder ect. 
---
My punch to my cousins chest is going to hurt him immensely more than the punch he'd throw back at me.
---
With the uno game you're playing to win, not with the intent of angering them. Most people who gank to it with the intent of ruining someone's day.
---
Look at the most recent post on here that blew up about the horde group mind-controlling and drowning the gnome. You think that was just, beating someone at pvp? Nope. That was done with the intent of pissing someone off.
---
"Messaging someone is a bitch move."
---
I don't really agree with this. 
---
Do you watch sports? Have you played sports? when I played football we'd talk shit to each other CONSTANTLY. Winning or losing we'd be jabbering at each other.
---
It's called shit talk, banter. People who do this to piss people off live for this kind of shit too. The whole, "living rent free" concept.
---
Oh it’s an absolute bloodbath every time I get in a boat
---
Sorry you dont understand context
---
A-fucking-goddamn-christ-on-a-cracker-men that shit was just as bad as STV.
---
you don't have a shaman....oh, alliance...ew.
---
&gt;of people who are cordianting on discord 
---
Or people literally advertising in trade chat, but ok man
---
Why only voted on by max-level players? Weren't all the Classic pushers saying how important the leveling process is and is a big reason why retail is failing? Now all we see is people spamming 5 man AOE farms to hit 60 as quick as possible. Blizz was right. You people really don't know what the hell you want.
---
I just logged back in with no issues. Was just concerned and wondering if anyone else had this issue
---
I lost a roll for that ring. I rolled 51. The warrior rolled 51. It went to the warrior. I near enough sobbed.
---
FEelsgoodman can finally win vs warriors and rogues..
---
Not really. Dual wield tanking doesn't work the same as it did on PS. The attack table changes significantly with an extra 9% parry on the boss, which affects your flurry uptime in a very negative way, and flurry is almost the entire point of the spec. In this phase, you could have alcors and deathbringer and edgemasters and \~35% crit when just about everything else you have is plate and it would work, otherwise you'd simply be generating more threat in prot, without sacrificing a ton of survivability.
---
I believe taurens can not ride darkspear raptors, but they can ride black war raptors and black war horses.
---
And the gnolls in the forests
---
All the Defias did was punch down further when they were being punched down on
---
Just like the Deadmines old wheel of safety!
---
Enchant: 2h Superior Impact vs Fiery Weapon vs 15 strength or agi.  I know that at the end of the day Crusader &gt; All but for the cheaper options which ones end up performing the best?
---
Titan panel
---
It was a 15, IIRC it was patched around the time that the AQ gates opened.
---
It was always designed as a 10, and I believe it is a 10 in classic.
---
Probably a brush.  Play on this scene from Little Mermaid.  
---
https://youtu.be/DQIlLi9XK6E
---
&gt;without amazing gear 
---
Without appropriate gear, more like it. You can tank fine in auction house greens as long as you choose your stats correctly and stack as much armor as you can.
---
I suspect most of the alarming bear tanks are people who are either geared exclusively for cat solo play and stacking STR, hit and crit...or are over-embracing their "hybrid" identity and wearing a pastiche of everything.
---
"Sorry full on mages, we have warr rogue lock priest"
---
Separate paths. One idea is to make classic servers for each expansion, the other is to go another route toward classic+...
---
The first is much easier for Blizzard to implement as most of the work is already done rather than having to create new content that didn't exist.
---
Retail UO is still running
---
Yeah that worked, sorry the chatmessage was throwing me. Thanks again!
---
it's just what generates the most threat.
---
Charge -&gt; Berserk Stance while charging -&gt; Berserk Rage -&gt; WW -&gt; Defensive Stance.
---
This is the highest AoE threat generator
---
Thank you! Happy cake day.
---
Pve servers can queue for BGs btw.
---
I'm sure they're going to have a really hard time spamming frost bolt over and over
---
Is it fun for you to be elitist?
---
which, again, is a moot point, because if you are mounting up, pretty good chance that mana is irrelevant.
---
While I don't disagree, I think that only really applies to people who raid past MC or spend a great deal of time world pvping. 
---
Like I said before there are other raids to consider, once you're past BWL that advantage drops and neither side from what I remember have an advantage.
---
You spelled Tauren incorrectly
---
Pretty much this, yeah. In TBC, AoE threat became much easier (warrior can now Thunderclap in d stance, druid Swipe could hit more than 3 targets now) but still required you to pay attention.
---
In WOTLK you could just run in and spam your abilities and pretty much never lose threat unless you died or got BoP'd.
---
Yeah the average player will be around 42 after 1 month. Most will hit 60 by mid october. MC will be on farm by most guilds by december. We actually need phase 3 asap. Pvp is the best late game time sink.
---
I’m a mage so I’m just *ALWAYS* running out of mana. Between causing mass AOE chaos and pounding water between every fight I had just had enough! So I switched to a rogue and never had to worry about fucking mana ever again!
---
That dragon was added later in classic for a kid who was sick and died and wanted to be in the game.....the the blizzard team added the sleeping red dragon for him.
---
I think dungeon runs are still worth it for the quest XP and the better gear that will help you level solo.
---
Kill a mob and complete a quest at level 1. Write down how much xp you earned. Kill a mob and complete a quest at 59. Write down how much xp you earned. If the two numbers are the same then your analysis is valid.
---
Errr, maybe I said the wrong thing.  Blood Rage?  The Warrior skill that generates 10 rage and then another 10 over time is what I meant.
---
I have the same thing, struck by nostalgia. Looking up builds at work, thinking about WoW in general, listening to music i listened during Vanilla, mostly Bloodhound Gang. It makes me feel like a Legend in my Spare Time :)
---
OP would be standing in the center of the boat in your analogy.
---
Unoptimized routes took me about 3.5days /played to get there. Speedrunners can hit 60 in about 5/6 days of /played on the slow end.
---
There's a post somewhere, but most of the ones that will get you suspended are ones that allow you to gain things or make kills in ways not intended by the game, such as you can't be reached. One big one is attacking the other faction from places with no pathing so they can't easily get you or guards won't get you/less likely to aggro.
---
For WW you are 1.5 seconds in beserker stance. It generates more threat than thunderclap.
---
You can also literally sit in WW stance whole dungeon and your healer if 60 will never go oom anyway.
---
I feel like I have to say this every damn time. It's not the class, it's not that dps can't pull. It's that bad players are bad. I pull dungeons all the time as a mage (and ask the tank first), if you do it intelligently, it's easy peasy. This player was not a reasonable example of what a mage is capable of in terms of pulling/ccing/controlling/and getting mobs to the tank.
---
Now I've also had groups where the tank is an idiot, and just charges in to five npc groups with the healer at 20% mana. Now do I think all tanks should l2p, get gud, etc? No, because I've seen other tanks do things perfectly. Hate the player, not the class.
---
This mf'er really just wrote a guide for warriors on how to find/keep people to do dungeons with.
---
Because they are bad
---
It’s a consistent pattern though
---
&gt;the hard part of Classic is the entire leveling process
---
I'd argue the leveling process is not hard, it's time consuming.
---
As long as you put in time you're guaranteed to reach 60 sooner or later.
---
altoholic!
---
I mained a hunter and Ret paladin through vanilla to current wow. I never got shit like this before everyone decided that “all mages are bad” in classic.
---
My point is, Blizzard is not going to implement a new feature, ESPECIALLY to Classic, that does not benefit the entire player base and has potential to be abused.
---
You can already put bounties on other players yourself, as is evidenced by this post. It's entirely player regulated.
---
Lvl 39 here, 32g in my wallet :(
---
*Wand pulls more mobs*
---
Yes this was always a thing. I remember many times as a paladin using Divine Shield or Lay on Hands, only to immediately die anyways and have the ability on cooldown.
---
Stop trying to make *fetch* happen.

Benedictionite reporting in boss!
---
I mean, I think when you make a mistake that is going to cost like six to ten days of your life to fix, you have a lot of room to plead for sympathy. It's a rough situation to be in.
---
I heard 'woo ping clan ain't nothing to fuck with!'
---
How do you undo it if you get tired of it?
---
Bringing in viability for tanking paladins/druids/shamans or more focused gear that allowed druids and shamans to main heal, not just be role players, would be genius. It would keep the feel of classic, open up fun new raids, and not overpower the naxx gear. This is an amazing idea and has me back on board for classic+. Love it.
---
There’s a hammer also.
---
That is the point.
---
I miss barrens chat.  Hillsbrad is just alliance are in yeti cave every 5 minutes and desolace is just where is rexxar every 5 minutes.  To all you alliance out there please kill any and all horde at yeti cave and spit on them for me please.  Kill rexxar too.
---
ooooh bad choice
---
Nope, which is why your DPS needs to do their best to not pull agro on non-focus. You need to be taking damage to be generating rage at a reasonable rate.
---
Sometimes people make mistakes.
---
I've complained about 1 warrior tank, I'll never run with him or his guild again. He was the 1 mob pull, pack of 3? oh lets cc 2 of the 3. I didn't go below 95% mana. I ended up in shadow form and dpsing people. He ignored my requests for larger pulls, told me they struggled earlier because the healer couldnt keep up. I'm not that healer I guarantee I can keep up. He asked to reset and I replied sorry no I cant spend 3 hours in a ZF run, if you would have sped up sure. I got some hate messages. He told me have fun healing in Shadow, he was a hard core vanilla raider who tanked everything and he know what he's doing. I wish I still had my old hard drive with screen shots of some realm firsts I had on my old tank. But without the proof it's hard to claim :-(.
---
In retail, for a long time now, the right way to do pyramid has been to rush to the bottom and aoe tank everything. Probably since Cata or so, whenever they did the first real dungeon overhaul and tanks got real aoe potential at low levels.
---
&gt; Cleaving is so much harder than normal runs
---
Not sure why this is even brought up, that's not the point of my discussion
---
the issue is if the only way people know how to do dungeons is to cleave, in situations where you're either in a group that doesn't have the right makeup, or where there's just a ton of hard mobs to cleave, what are you going to do? just sit there?
---
learning to have your tank gain aggro, ccing, LOS pulling, is a necessity that people are forgoing just because they wanna meme instances like their favorite streamers do
---
Damn.
---
Yeah, Walle was a fucking savage lol. Crossed my fingers running from Kargath to BRM with laser focus and sound turned up every time.
---
I use Q for stealth, E for SS or backstab, R for gouge, F for eviscerate, G for escape artist, X for kick, Z for blade furry, T for adrenaline rush, V for kidney shot. C for slice and dice. When stealthed I use, E for cheap shot, and F for ambush.
---
If the stats back up that classic has a huge player base a few months after launch then I think it’s very possible. They will want to keep sub numbers high and most of those playing classic probably don’t want to pay a sub for retail.
---
Classic+ content could likely be created by a much smaller team since it would likely be simpler, smaller scale and less graphically intensive. And if blizz know that those playing classic will cancel subs without content and won’t join retail then there are only 3 options.
---
1. Let subs die down 
---
2. Classic+ content 
---
3.  A huge overhaul of retail to incorporate classic elements (which based on the shadowlands leak sounds likely along with the upcoming level squish etc) 
---
I guess maybe there is TBC but I think most people don’t want that.
---
Came from retail, only play retail to raid with people I like.
---
I am not worrying...  When I go to the Scarlet Monastery (lvl 30-40) there are like 30 people  just standing in the LOBBY (the area with the 4 doors)  , waiting for their group members.   I have never seen that before, not on pservers or back in 2005.  Usually you saw 1-2 groups max.  
---
Same in cities 20-40 people at the mailbox at any time, except early in the morning .
---
my only complaint is the economy,  most of my old trade secrets don't work anymore because 1001 other people also know about it these days....
---
I need the minimap button frame from retail to be able to be used in classic.  I have like 1239081792837 addons in the minimap, and it is unusable really.  I am desperate, so I may try to use the retail one and see how much breaks using it in classic.
---
I really wish auctionator was able to cap the bid price at vendor price + auction house fees. It's good at automatically undercutting, but annoying if you have to manually adjust the starting bid.
---
Classic + is the only move they have. Going through all the expansions 1 by 1 is ridiculous and they would have never brought classic back for it to just die. 
---
They thought about this already, long time ago.
---
You mean you've never heard of 30 year old boomers?
---
A friend of mines character had the same name, as someone I don't. It default whispers the battlenet account, when I /w.
---
Playing a gnome and can not wait to get exalted with IF because the fucking mechanostrider’s CONSTANT sound  is beyond annoying.
---
*without pissing anyone off :D
---
Not sure I follow :p this happens on retail too
---
You got trolled
---
Slippery slope!!
---
Thanks it's a very ramificated chain, didn't notice it
---
I just remember it being cool from a long time ago.
---
I feel like 50-60 isn't too bad. There are so many quests and you can finally start looking at your prebis list and get yourself ready for BRD.
---
If I have to deal with another person rolling on gear that wasn't made for them because some website told them it was 'BiS' I'm going to scream.
---
Was not a thing in Vanilla.
---
You should totally just choose one now
---
General consensus is going 2h fury until 36 (ww) or 40 (ms) and then redpeccing into arms. Then when u get to 60 u decide wether u want to play arms/fury/tank.
---
I swapped to arms at 36, and i kinda regretted it. Should have stayed fury until 40 since i couldnt aoe grind the way i thought i would be able to ^^
---
Tauren can't ride the war raptor, it's strictly limited to the other races. Horde can't get the black war horse, so they can't ride that either. 
---
However, tauren can ride the ZG Raptor and Baron's Deathcharger, so as long as you're lucky, you can have an undead horse or raptor.
---
Literally go look at OSRS. 
---
It absolutely works.
---
Probably moves with qewasd  and takes his hand off of his mouse I’m assuming
---
I took herbalism and I've vendored all of my herbs. They don't sell on the AH. And the vendor price is extremely low, so I've probably made less gold from the herbs than I spent training the herbalism skills.
---
ZG is going live in Phase 4.
---
Hahahaha
---
Classic has kinda made mages into the new huntards. Every group ONLY wants mage dps and they ONLY want them to AoE. This results in people not knowing how to play their class outside of using blizzard.
---
I am the guy who NEVER bought/used a mount EVER!. I ALWAYS played a mage//arcane/female/alliance/[samename]: ONE character, NO "alts."
---
the name was/is
---
"Relayor"
---
I'm thinking about working on a bounty hunting add-on, where you could list bounties globally and other people with the add-on could see and take them.
---
Would people be interested in this? Does anyone know if Blizzard risks blocking it for reasons similar to LFG addons, are there any clear rules about that? Is anyone else already working on a similar addon?
---
Yay, new players! Please dont join full servers - some of us have work and would like not to see even higher queue times on our servers when we get home! (Yes, we all know of teamviewer, google, rdp, ssh and so on so dont even mention it)
---
I was checking out this version: https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-warlock-pvp-guide
---
Wowhead has one as well. Again would appreciate an expert opinion since i’ve never really played before.
---
holy shit how many people in this sub are still playing on private servers?
---
It's actually super fucking annoying that everyone only wants a specific type of group. It already takes forever to get a tank but then you add these cleavetards into the mix and it takes hours to find anyone wanting to farm a dungeon.
---
Honestly why are you complaining? Being in high demand is great lol
---
It IS a social game and as a warrior your dick should be getting hard at all the attention you're gonna get endgame.
---
Lmao someone's got to.
---
a hunter makes more money than a mage once dm opens.
---
Let's see i got 3 dwarfs(hunter, rogue. priest), 2 gnomes(mage, lock), 2 humans(paladin, warrior) and 1 night elf (druid)
---
I have the toughest time vs hunters XD
---
Thanks guy.  We're glad you posted.  Really.
---
I'm 49 and have yet to be in a group with a stupid Mage. I've had a few Huntards though that pull a lot. So far no bad experiences running dungeons with Mages though.
---
you had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Hearth out?
---
My hunter gets lots of whispers to buy stuff.
---
Sir, sir!  Buy this blue sword!  It's  got +strength!  Hunters use everything, right?
---
Or you could look at it as, people are getting them faster now so it's MORE likely for you to get one
---
 No.... spinal
---
No, I am a fury warrior who has also done naxx. I have main tanked naxx. 
---
If you think any rando tank you get in a pug is "bad" because you can do more dps than his aggro, then your just a fucking idiot, regardkess of experience.
---
Good to hear that other tanks didn't get shafted as hard as my Brewmaster.
---
As I see it, here's how things played out:
---
At the beginning of WoD, Brewmaster was statistically underperforming. Instead of buffing each of their abilities a little bit, they just *doubled* the shield from Guard. Of course, with Resolve being as it was, this means monks could Guard for shields bigger than their entire health pool, and that was on a 30 second CD.
---
So yeah, major fuckup. 
---
And the thing is, it was just *bad* Brewmasters who were struggling. Us good players were freaking invincible, and Guard only exacerbated that. You're right, monk tanking was very volatile. 
---
But the thing is that Blizzard *never* gave monks the tools they needed to play the damn spec: namely a **Stagger Meter**, or even a good idea of when they should Purify the staggered damage. All you have by default is a debuff icon that's either green, yellow, or red, and I think the in-game advice at the time was to Purify red, and maybe yellow if you had extra Chi. In reality, if you hit red you were probably dead already; I would Purify *high* green stagger frequently, but you can't *see* high green without addons.
---
I think it was the second major patch in WoD when they nerfed the Stagger percentage, buffed Brewmaster armor to high hell, and still didn't nerf the busted Guard. At this point I figured the designers were utterly lost, and quit the game. Then in Legion I saw they removed Resolve, removed *Chi (WTF EVEN)* from Brewmaster, and *still* didn't put in a good way to track Stagger damage. So I only felt more validated in my decision to quit.
---
BTW, how did the "put most everything on the GCD" thing in BFA turn out?
---
If I'm being totally honest I think it can be totally worth to invest in at least a gathering profession to help you with some buffer cash. Id say you at least need to play the entire experience up til lvl 40 with the mount in mind though. Biggest tips I can give you are not spending money on skills you don't need, spend time to farm mobs and collect a ton of vendor'able grays and white items, and don't bother investing money into new armor/weapons (a lot of the time you'll get upgrades naturally through questing or dungeons). I personally did skinning/mining and it didn't necessarily give me all my money, but it gave me a nice buffer-bump of money to add to the questing and grinding.
---
The guide that says to skip Felhunter and Succubus because Voidwalker are awesome tanks?  Hard pass as private servers overtuned Voidwalkers.
---
Same for the claims about spirit being good for warlocks.  Imp Soul Drain is a waste of talent points and you will have to uber micro manage your playstyle to realize the benefit.  Heavy affliction can chain pull, restore health with spells, and gain mana from dark pact/life tap.  If you are casting drain soul, you are in the 5 second rule.  Mob dies and you need a minimum of 5 seconds to exit it then another 5 to gain 100% regen before the effect ends.  In short, unless you can channel drain soul for 5+ seconds and still have the mob die with your blueberry dps, rank 1 soul drain, and dots, for each and every mob you kill... Then find a way to delete your excessive soul shards without accidentally deleting quest items... You start to realize that spirit is a terrible stat for warlocks and should be avoided.
---
Substantially easier to use a Succubus and drain tank your way to 60.  Higher damage output with faster kills, able to handle more mobs, and actually using the class for fun instead of attempting a Starcraft level of APM to eek out a minor potential return.
---
To answer the question, go look at general leveling guides.  Nothing is that specific to each class that changes how you approach each zone.  Gear guides are about the only value of private server warlock's knowledge.
---
Y'all have it hard XD. No one sees you in bushes, and you're too short to get credited for work.
---
You can only play on one character per account at a time.
---
As well, you can only have characters from one faction per PVP server.
---
You're not wrong. Maybe some people will find value in knowing Gorosh spawn rate I encountered. Cut me some slack I was bored at work today!
---
This is why I rolled pve server. I was an avid arena player, got glad a few times early on, love doing premade bgs, but I’d put my fist through my monitor if I got camped while levelling. The amount of QQ posts about world pvp is astonishing....they give you the option to avoid it completely, maybe some people should.
---
Not surprised you seem like the kind of person that likes getting clapped
---
it is so
---
Why does it matter to you what player is behind a character as long as the slots are all filled with characters that can accomplish their role requirements?
---
The reason the officers were giving invites on the dl is because the expectation is baseless.   It only matters if you're actually short on people, but since the raid happened the guild obviously wasn't short.
---
Doesnt this video show that low levels can put up a fight though?
---
I am aware I have played pservs over the years. They are never quite the same. Tweaked and poor owner management over time.
---
Gouge usually works. But I do agree SS is much easier and cheaper too.
---
Pretty sure they removed the ZG mounts in classic
---
Also, give the poor gnome her underwear back!!!
---
Why is this griefing? I don’t understand
---
"..heil Lothar"
---
You have to download atlas classic maps addon to be the data source for your dungeon maps.  Two addons are required to see the maps for dungeons.  But being able to decypher BRD is something the addons will not be able to even help with.  That map is pretty fucked if you are looking for something in the relic or prison area.
---
60 in a month is about right. Given the modern tools at our disposal it makes sense.
---
If ppl wanna talk about it let them.
---
Probably the only one active in the guild so I think I gotta find another one.
---
Yea I think he was nice too. It's just at that moment the whole experience bothered me so I did not want to be in further contact with any of them. Kinda like slap your face then go does it hurt I'll ice your face if you want.
---
You also have the tanks that lose aggro after two crits from the dps spell caster even though they had all day to get it.
---
I have 1 character and just got to 30 -_-
---
What’s average level across realms? Anyone know where we can find updated statistics?
---
At the end of the day, I think Skull, X, and Moon, are the most important ones. And let's not forget that blue square. But as long as the team is all on the same page, it'll be a good time.
---
I like to use the green triangle on myself when I need people to follow me. Or whichever color contrasts the best with the terrain.
---
Prot and holy can actually be fairly efficient. Not exactly hunter, mage, wl or priest efficient but acceptable. Just treat your paladin like a mage. Fight about 8 mobs at the same time with consecration, ret aura and block damage and then drink/eat to full afterwards. 
---
Ret while leveling is generaly considered suffering due to hit and miss mechanics.
---
The reasons the axe is preferred because it's very slow swing speed and high damage range, so attacks that are based on weapon damage hit harder with WW Axe than WW Sword, and people also prefer Axe Specialization rather than Sword Specialization talents.
---
They just announced 5 more years to d2 dude.
---
No, you listen for the splash. I'm conditioned now so I just tap that button under my finger as soon as I hear it. I only have to look up to position the curse on the next cast
---
Not sure if I've ever been more physically ill from a screenshot in my liffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Id say for a troll or human especially spirit can make a difference, as well as trollsblood potions, and health potions, the passive and emergency healing is very tidy for levelling.
---
When someone comes up to me and just says "Water" and stands there waiting, I give them a stack of rank 1.
---
Say please, please. Politeness goes a long way.
---
I probably would have added him to my ignore list, less idiots to deal with.
---
Just hit level 46 on my warrior. Questing is somewhat painful but ZF Zombie runs is really hit or miss, and groups disband the instant we wipe or someone pulls too much.
---
Any questing areas that are good for me? Or should I just try to truck it out with melee cleave zombies and hope for the best?
---
How are you trying to be elitist about your class at level 42 lmao
---
would you mind linking me? would appreciate it.
---
Well that’s unfortunate to hear. I thought I could
---
detect stealth. I swear it works with NPCs. Maybe it’s my imagination. At least water breathing is helpful sometimes.
---
Since that’s how mage cleave groups do it.., yes
---
I'm honestly curious what you are basing this opinion off of?  WoW Subs went up 230% since Classic was released and speaking personally I will never play retail.  To say there just isnt a player base, or that Blizzard has no incentive to create a Classic+ team is just wrong IMO.  I see it being a lot more likely, that IF classic has sustained popularity through the first 3 phases, that we will see a more hashed out plan from Blizzard as to what is next.  Maybe Classic+, maybe TBC, maybe a mix of both.
---
Hah, nice try, but you don't have a shaman yet.
---
wouldn't be surprised if they're bluffing. 
---
Hot take: Forcing the fun big servers to shatter themselves into pieces with queues is a *drastically* worse option that just keeping layering how it is
---
A mage needed on a runecloth robe pattern? What's the issue here? You're mad because you needed it as well and didn't roll need? Dude, that's on you, people roll /need on patterns/recipes they don't have all the time, that's pretty much standard etiquette.
---
&gt; A naga gives you a swim speed buff that makes it accessible
---
I wonder if Aquatic Form is fast enough to get out there without the buff.
---
That’s where my dad said our worg went when it got sick too!
---
When you look up "bad faith argument" in the dictionary it should show you this comment.
---
Alright then...
---
In your analogy, OP is logging in and out every 20 seconds on each side of the boat as they swap accounts?
---
Just so I understand the order of events. A recipe drops, you roll greed on it because you have no plans to use it, and he rolls need on it because he plans to use it. And you are upset that you didn't win it.
---
Hate this.
---
Gouge means you're wasting energy on something that does very little damage, then waiting another few seconds for energy to recharge while doing 0 damage. There's a reason every good rogue levels with SS over backstab
---
I played a warlock in vanilla and didn't realize how annoying this is.  As a healer it's such a pain I'd rather have a mage for the same (or more) dps and not having to constantly heal them.
---
While we're on the topic... Can you warlocks NOT fucking spam lifetap?!
---
If you're Oom, the healer is most likely oom too. If you lifetap instead of drinking, you're forcing the healer to drink his shitty 1992mana over 30s drink twice to refill his mana, THEN spend 30% of it to heal you and sit AGAIN. It's extremely counterproductive and annoying, thank you.
---
Wrong buddy. The proper way to AoE tank is:  
---
Bloodrage, charge, demo shout, spam battle shout.  
---
If damage mitigation is also an issue you slip a thunderclap in there before the demo shout.  
---
Whirlwind is terrible aggro generation. It is literally the same as auto attack threat generation and it applies only to the targets it directly hits.  
---
I don't think I will be taking tanking advice from the likes of you, thanks.
---
&gt;shittiest phase of the game over and over again?
---
Obv subjective.
---
Bleameux discord has a bounty board, it's pretty great.
---
If work is cool with it, go for it!  My brother gets up early to play an hour or so before work and plays an hour or two before bed.  Back in the day it took over his life, literally.  And about took nine over, but I didn't have kids or any real responsibility either!   Now, a wife, kid, work... So I play when I can, usually an hour or two before bed. 
---
Don't get to play with my brother, but we're on the same server, and when we can play together we will.  I'm just enjoying the game, having fun, and not burning out.  Love it!
---
Well that was your choice. Blizz shouldn’t force people that actually want to be on a pve server to merge to pvp.
---
FYI you’re part of the problem if you wanted to play alliance pvp but rolled pve. I am alliance on an imbalanced pvp server mostly leveling outside of instances and I’m still enjoying it.
---
Its effective yes. But many of them arent dot tracking, and are easily out dpsed - you can tell the vets of classic from the interested parties.
---
hillsbrad was a mixed bag for me since I'm on a popular pvp server. Mobs get super competitive and alliance are aggressive in hillsbrad. Was faster to just farm mobs for forever than quest here
---
Beautiful.
---
Right, well I mean it's not a perfect situation on either side, nobody is arguing that. So I suppose if you want a more leisurely, don't mind running here n back then alliance works for you, if you want a more rushed, early/mid game convenience then I suppose horde is more your thing. Not to say that you can't do either or on either or side, though.
---
Can confirm.
---
Am gnome. Am also a complete piece of shit that kills anything that moves. 
---
(Granted Whitemane horde is full of streamer taiwanese/chinese twitch fanboys that ruin the server, so my actions are somewhat justified.)
---
Is there an addon that shows my target's cast bar?
---
Exactly, agree with you there. So if someone instantly hits need on a BoE without the group agreeing on something before, they definitely acted selfish that moment.
---
Here you go :) thats best option for me. see crits and overheal

---
Haven't played retail since WotLK, what do people mean when they say the PvP is more "balanced" in retail? Do classes no longer hard counter each other?
---
Re: tanking. I'm finding it hard to manage aggro in dungeons when playing with certain classes. For instance locks start spamming dots on all mobs and I lose aggro. Is this my fault or his?
---
Generally what I'm doing is trying to get rend on mobs then just spam SA on a single target
---
Something similar happened to me during launch week. I was porting to moonglade and a literal second before the spell goes off I see stitches trundle into view behind me. I survived unscathed, but my pants, sadly, did not
---
I feel like some people are under the impression that I'm tanking, I'm doing DPS as arms
---
On a BoE?
---
Rattlegore has been a really drama free high pop server with the full spectrum of players. I like it.
---
I didn’t say “demo shout” does nothing I said “demo shout spam” doesn’t do anything. My thought is that once the debuff is applied there is no additional threat from spamming it. Obviously reapply once it falls off though. 
---
Am I wrong on this point?
---
Autoattack
---
The succubus is so damn strong. No need to worry if you jump off a ledge. Very strong auto attacks. Powerful on demand CC for pats, or a rogue alliance scumbag trying to gank you. Plenty of mana to Pact away. ~~entertaining sound effects~~
---
So you mean I'm not supposed to just run into all the whelps without letting my team know while shouting my name?
---
I get that but at the same time it'd be nice if everyone else had the capacity not to blank out and gawk, instead maybe trying to do something to make it work and clear faster on something that doesn't pose much of a threat.
---
Fuck off, retard.
---
Please don't do that.
---
The tank will frequently move off Skull onto the other targets. to tap them with a sunder etc. You don't want the DPS hitting those.
---
Just keep killing Skull. If Skull isnt marked, kill the most dead thing.
---
No idea who are bastards that downvoted you. Thanks for validating me thoughts.
---
I told the warlock who left the group earlier that they kicked me out for another guildie and he went well lucky that I bailed then.
---
This is super useful, printing it out to track them. Thank you.
---
People are used to the game being very topheavy and aren't really in the mindset to understand what the grind TRULY is.
---
The majority of the playerbase is still in their 30's and sadly, it's not until 42 or 44 that you hit the half way mark to 60 in terms of playtime.
---
And yes people are already complaining that they are bored waiting for the next phase, because they skipped a lot of the content, and not only that.... there's a laundry list of things to do at 60.
---
I think I have my next 200-300 hours after hitting 60 already planned. There's 3 major rep grinds I need to do and that's just for my enchanting.... that's not including my epic mount, and various other tasks I want to do for my own enjoyment.
---
What? I'm not sure its taken me more than like 45 seconds to find any dungeon group at any time of day yet. I mean, maybe at 60, but a tiny fraction of the population is there right now
---
Do the horde have a cool, overarching quest like the Onyxia one for Alliance?
---
"haha DPS pulling aggro and taking more damage than the tank is fine, you're just bad git gud xd xd"
---
Very insightful post.
---
Whenever I think of Troll Warriors its back to the old machinima ‘Time Gnomes’ were he’s making fun of a guys girlfriend for playing Troll Warrior “look she even specced 3 points into Booming Voice”...
---
Its been years since I’ve seen that greatness and it can’t get out of my head.
---
I have a friend from high school who only just hit 16.
---
Limited free time is limited dawg.
---
Nobody, or at least I'm not saying there aren't inconveniences for the horde, but late game with mounts and summons, portals and all that can cut down the travel time considerably, you used 1 example here, sure ok getting to the badlands can be a bit problematic for the horde at first, but considering that they have nearly all of Kalimdor, I think the advantage for them in terms of early game at least is a bit more. 
---
So let's look at what alliance has to do to get from Northshire to Teldrassil starting zone. 
---
NS, GS, SW, IF, Dun Morogh, Loch, Wetlands, Darkshore, Darnassus, Dolanaar, starting zone. 9 zones however much time it takes for you to get through the zones, dying, recovering body, etc. 
---
I think the horde have it ever so much better and this is coming from a player that has played both sides. Granted I'm not trying to turn this into a competition or rant about which is better, just a simple discussion on QoL for horde vs ally.
---
I remember getting this item from the (¿Gor'Dunni) ogres in Northern Feralas in vanilla. I thought it was a perfect fit and didn't know until today that you can get it from any humanoid in that level range. I even sold it on the auction house! Back then there weren't extensive databases and wikis on everything, so people actually bought that kind of stuff.
---
So go level to 60 and come back and tell us how fast it was 43-60 compared to 1-43. Hint: you won't.
---
Shazzrah weeb realm confirmed
---
Yes, quite a bit more
---
Punt that stupid bitch back to Gnomeregon
---
Night elf druid and I'm in Westfall now for lvling some dudes outa my guild says it's very fast there
---
They've been telling people to change servers since the day after name reservations became available. If the community on the huge servers shatter, I'm not sure whose fault that is. They've thoroughly explained how layers are preventing queues, they've explained (and PROMISED) that layering will be rolled back into non-existence before the launch of Phase 2, and they've explained that the population cap increase was a stop-gap measure but not a solution.
---
I'm not sure if there's a solution, but the pain is coming either way. Guild masters need to step up for their guilds. Friends need to come to some agreements about plans. It's like a hurricane is coming and people hope everyone evacuates except for them, because they want THIS hurricane shelter.

And yeah, our first names start with L and C
---
Thanks, I'll look into it. Glad to know Auctioneer is a good backup option here.
---
Yeah it was a bad situation, and the reason I gave him some  coin. Wish i could have given him more but we're all struggling to get that mount money right now.
---
Hey guys lets keep trying to make Classic+ happen
---
Notice how they were other mages.  LOL.
---
Dire mauls closed.
---
Sorry I guess I could have made that more clear, I meant that once the dungeons start I usually get about 45min-hour/half of dungeon grinding. So that doesn't include finding the group, I would say that I get 45min-hour and a half of strict in dungeon time on hand before having to hop off for a bit.
---
What makes it ridicules to go through the expansions? And making classic+ is literally killing the game immediately too.
---
That human has to have something that makes him small cause that dwarf is almost as tall as him and as far as I know lore characters aren't giants in classic
---
Yep, the Test of Skulls!
---
I am. Both specs use it, it’s just that the Feral/Balance build takes leader of the pack and then the damage points down to clarity over in balance and then furor and enrage while the hybrid stops at HoTW and moves over to work it’s way down to get natures swiftness.
---
Thank you, as a mage in every game I ever play if it's an option. And Mage in wow since original release. This made me laugh out loud so hard today, thank you!
---
How about one that shows the aggro range of mobs so you can run by them without pulling them!
---
Honestly u should. These people trying to get u to stick with it are just wasting your time. If 1-10 was THAT slow to you, you won't enjoy the rest of the way.
---
Even if both sides behave like this most PvP servers tilt heavily in favor of the Horde. Guess which side is getting ganged more when you have twice as many enemies.
---
That's not what was implied. Sorry if you read into it much to far, or in this case too little, of course 400 calories isnt going to make a difference, you're being pedantic about what was said. When what was implied was if your diet consists of shit You won't be making a difference reguardless of what you do. I highly suggest if you're interested in the subject that you visit some of the fitness subs as they go into better details and provide solid sources that wont steer you into supplements.
---
Both have roles they can fulfill in groups, at least.  What is 'optimal' is one question but viable is another question.  Those specs can still get into raids but the problem is that they very clearly CANNOT have like 3 or 4 of them in a raid.  They're fun in PVP though.  0/18/33 or something similar can be fun as Ret, and Enh has obvious weaknesses but can be an effective "squishy defender" as I prefer to think of it as.  Enh can't be a frontline attacker like a warrior, but the high burst make them effective within a defensive context in larger scale PVP.  So painful though, so easy to get kited or stunlocked.
---
If I have to start using Hellfire, shit has officially hit the fan and you prob should be keeping me up.

If I'm playing a crafter who can learn a recipe, I roll need on it. Adding +1 to my known recipes list is worth more than any amount of gold.
---
I dunno. With the exception of the groups I’m in that overgear/outlevel the dungeon I’m almost always top 1-2 on DPS as a warlock, and that’s with almost always waiting until I see a sunder to DoT something. Sometimes a sweeping strikes warrior will beat me, or a hunter on a short pull, but it’s not frequent.
---
They can't avoid queues and when layering gets removed the bigger servers are going to be fucked.
---
Just looked at some images and it reminds me of dragonfable
---
I was tanking DM. I was level 36 so way over leveled and I still could not keep agro with the dps spamming as soon as I pulled. If they gave me half a chance to pull that is. These people were like half my level too.
---
Guides which go over where to quest and what to grind are usually class agnostic. I'm not aware of any which are for a specific class.
---
/cry
---
From my understanding you should never roll if someone is going to equip that item even if it is boe. However, everyone needing on it is common to help stop ninjas from needing on that epic bow worth 800g.
---
Myzrael is the "It's VC, not DM" in /2 server.   Seriously, just throw that little firecracker in there at any time and /popcorn.
---
I usually also say "It's named after Edwin Van Diremaul"
---
1. As far as I know, with "Group Loot" enabled, quest items are a separate drop for everyone. So it shouldn't take longer than usual, but you can definitely kill mobs faster in a group.
---
2. You do what you deem fun. There are a lot of different playstyles in WoW: Classic. Some people i.e. are always questing in a group, chilling and chatting together.
---
4. I agree with you, Vanilla WoW isn't forcing people to interact with each other. That would be weird regardless, I mean, you can't force people to become friends or anything. Still Vanilla has a lot of mechanics in place which heavily encourage social interaction.
---
If you're doing a dungeon together, and can't just find a new group with a few mouse clicks, then you're really starting to see your group members as something more valuable. If you want to counter-gank an enemy ganker, you'll have to look for like-minded people and commit to a counter-offense with them. All which can lead to people actually talking and knowing each other.
---
I would absolutely use that
---
Opposite, go gnomish first the goblin. Gnomish has all the BoP cool stuff, where as goblin has all the big BoE items to craft.
---
Honestly it's not worth it. I'm gonna have an alt which I'll have goblin on anyway, and it's basically only sapper charges that are worth crafting on goblin. Also you are forced into having the goblin teleport to winterspring which is far inferior to gadgetzan tp from gnomish(you can't use both).
---
You're right, however there is a difference between moving at a snails pace - and a DPS pulling like a flipperhanded monkey and wiping you. Dying makes the dungeon take longer, in retail you can be half braindead in most dungeons, don't need to talk, just slap your keyboard and still come out just fine, and these idiots (most of them mages) are still doing that. A DPS can facepull like crazy in dungeons and the tank can grab em with an ability or 2. in classic - yeah you can do groups the way these guys want to, but it requires the pulls to be set up and planned, communication is key, biggest difference between the 2 games - in classic - people talk, the ones that don't...well..we can tell who the BFA babies are.  
---
Also - a l o t of people care its not retail, and a l o t of people are tired of having to repeat that same thing because of jackholes like the above mentioned.
---
Oh snap! I used to listen to that one too! Good share!
---
Following because as a 1st time hunter (lvl 11) I wanna hear experienced input
---
Or use the world chat channel!
---
&gt; Is this my fault or his?
---
His.
---
AOE threat in classic is incredibly difficult to manage, anything over 3 and you're really done for. Depending on class, Paladins have a much easier time once stuff starts pounding on them but warriors and druids, 3 is comfortable anything over that is a mess, even for experienced tanks.
---
Don't forget to mash thunder clap on cooldown, and keep demo shout up, they are good threat generators.
---
Nah I read it man, but blizzard isnt going to merge servers. There aren't any alliance dominated pvp servers. So if you hate the transfers to only horde folks, then there will be only horde folks on the new server see? Or is there some critical piece of information I'm missing?
---
“I highly recommend trying to find a decent group of guys who plays at your times to run with. It makes situations like this a lot easier. “
---
I’m having the hardest time cause I typically play from like 10pm-3 on a Medium Pop(Old Blanchy) US server.
---
Same. I might be 60 by now if I wasn’t an altoholic. I have a Druid nelf, gnome mage, dwarf warrior, and just started a human rogue. I haven’t even started Hordeside yet, but I know I’m gonna make a Tauren shaman, orc Hunter, a warlock and a priest
---
He's right though, the alliance doesn't start ANY fight if the odds are about equal but will attack ANYTHING they can kill for sure. 3v1? Good. 5v1? PERFECT. 10v1? DIVINE!!!! 13v1 who's 10 levels below? OAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
---
I also love the thrill of love pvp, but the alliance doesn't seem to get how it's supposed to work. They go to lower level areas and massacre lowbies instead of doing it normally. I guess you need to evacuate the frustration of choosing the lame faction :/
---
&gt; he says he “needs” and doesn’t have it learned yet.
---
Where did you read that? Maybe you should check again cause OP was the one talking about it is only useful for gold... 
---
 "he says he “needs” and doesn’t have it learned yet... and I explained I don’t either and no one ever uses that robe, and offer to roll for it since it’s just gold."
---
Exactly, it's not some massive endeavor. They've already got locations for plenty of raids, and a lot of them could just be ported over from retail essentially... Grim batol, uldum, karazhan, caverns of time, sunwell, gilneas, and emerald dream are all easy things to insert, over half of which have already been done and they could recycle a lot of models/animations with minor tweaks.
---
The big thing IMO to keep the vanilla feeling is just to add a bunch of events and quest chains alongside these new patches, similar to the AQ war effort/pre-naxx events; which aren't super high effort. Also, don't make it all level 60 content, add in plenty of new leveling stuff to keep people interested in the rest of the game.
---
Are you serious?! Is there a source for this?
---
Let what go? I posted this to have a discussion on the topic? You are no authority to have anyone drop their own topic. If you don't have anything insightful or interesting to say about it, then maybe you'd be best off to stop replying. Or don't. I don't care. Do you, boo boo
---
The only part that never made sense is how you get extra gold/items from pick pocketing mobs that you kill afterwards. What now, are you not gonna search its pockets after its dead?
---
For sure.  I just don't think that there would be very many players doing that.   And if they made it a bannable offense, I don't think many players would risk that.
---
Ahhh I see
---
Damn this is confusing.
---
Is the person responding unware of the difference in LFG and LFM, and doesn't know that LFM 1 Tank means, they have a group of 4 people and are missing a tank? Or the person saying LFM 1 Tank is trying to be cute and say they are a tank and are looking for 3 DPS and Heals?
---
Elondril was the NE! Really can't remember the gnomes.
---
Find 4 other who feel the same way and run dungeons with them. This isnt a single player game.
---
Transfer to Heartseeker,if we get like 1k more horde would be perfect server
---
From my understanding, you are mistaken. Each application provides an aggro boost, however small.
---
I'm happy to be corrected. But I still spam demo shout and I still find mobs stick to me better than without.
---
In fairness I ran a cath AoE run as a warrior tank a while back and it was insanely fast and I felt entirely irrelevant. They would eye of kilrog pull and my job was to.... To.... Watch?
---
If it’s an issue, just start marking targets. Try to get a few autos in on the other mobs while your group burns down the marked target. I’m a bear so idk if that helps much for warriors or not, but that’s how I’ll do it if my group is making my life difficult. 
---
Also always be the leader so you can boot idiots, ninjas, and people who drag your group down.
---
Leveling lockpicking for Rogues is also a separate effort, you literally have to grind out the skill by opening locks, it doesn't just automatically level up with you
---
It’s a nuisance while leveling. Quiver takes away a bag space and then you have to keep meat for your pet.
---
Jagged arrows can be expensive so I didn’t switch to them until I hit 60 and switched to marksmanship.
---
I agree, especially as shaman running dungeons is easy. Up until now while under-leveled I healed, at the right level dps, and if I needed to run anymore while over leveled I tanked and it has been pretty smooth. While doing the beginnning of SM GY/Lib just waiting I have seen a high demand for melee cleave shamans is all.
---
It's always going to be hard to hold threat when warlocks do that. It's a little of both. Never use rend while tanking. Spamming Sunder Armor and Revenge whenever you can is your best bet to hold aggro. Tab through sundering everything and taunting whenever necessary.
---
Her: I bet he is thinking him: about other women?
---
Haha, tasteless indeed! I figure this is what ill be doing. Thanks m8
---
101 responses barely means anything
---
One of my buddies sent me 3 runecloth bags when I hit level 30. Holy smokes. Life is amazing and I'm *RICH.* I haven't put a single item in my 5th bag yet. i can go adventuring for like 3 hours and still have an entire empty bag.
---
LoL, I bet he never makes that mistake again!
---
Try seeing if there's a 'game mode' for your TV. Lots of tv's default settings make for smoother pictures/framerates but cause a lot of input lag.
---
Energy Watch v2 PLEASE
---
Just to clarify when /w people to make a group for a dungeon, I occasionally get the response "lfg"... Could  we not just make a group? I'd be more than willing to hunt for players
---
While leveling? 
---
Your damage stat + spirit.
---
The absolute most fun I’ve ever had in any version of wow, at any time, is grouping with a Druid and getting into dicy situations while questing.
---
Things can look totally like a wipe, we pulled a large group by accident, spawns on us, too low level, whatever, but with a Druid we always seemed to survive by the skin of our teeth. Fridaus, if you read this I remember.
---
not if you can't use it if oom/silenced or it takes ages if your casting speed is slowed.
---
There are I think five or six possible locations where Devilsaurs can spawn, yes.
---
I don't have any numbers. I was told battle shout needs to hit 4 or more party members to generate enough aggro to out strip demo shout. And in either case, you'd be better served spamming revenge/sunder armour. It's only very useful when you have more than 6 guys on you, and when you just want to hold aggro off the healer.
---
My stealth is on middle click, I use ElvUI tho, it's pretty straightforward: mouse over the skill and press the button you want to bind
---
I assume I wont raid enough to get any particularly valuable enchanting recipes.  At least not before countless other enchanters already have them and tailoring hardly seems like a gold printer.  I just can't help but look at both of these and see money pits with little return.  If this isn't a good way to see them, please educate me on what I'm missing (only ever played TBC/ WOTLK)
---
I think Hunters will always have the taking loot memes, but mages are clearly the new asshole stereotype.
---
What's with the coloring on your screen?
---
Still less than the nobles
---
Are they adding “pvp” gear? Thought I heard they wouldn’t but idk..
---
Raid tanking in the end, but dungeon tanking for now.
---
I watched the Tips Out deep dive with Skarm and a few more of Skarm's videos...I've got a good feel for what it can/can't do in endgame.  Ironically, I'm pretty comfortable with the gearing part and the complexity of the feral druid raiding discussion, like knowing I need bags full of MCP and all that...but it's literally "how do I tank" that's messing with me.  Maybe I'm just overthinking it.
---
\&gt;  For tanking in dungeons though, tabbing, spamming swipe, and throwing out some demoarlizing roars are all you really need for AoE threat. They're actually much better at AoE than warriors are, honestly. Spam swipe on mobs, use maul to get single target threat, taunt if you lose aggro to the healer. 
---
Thanks.  I'll bring some guildies and give it a try on Ulda soon I think.  Luckily the single target threat is pretty straightforward, spamming Maul is pretty easy.  
---
For AoE I'll try the tab-swipe method and see if I can hold aggro.
---
Happened to me in BRD. Feared into the instance, except it didn't instance me until I tried to run back out.
---
HELP
---
Did you help him? People get so caught up in others “not enjoying the classic experience” that they end up just being toxic and go against the classic experience anyway.
---
Nope. Started WoW right when BC came out. First time I played a warlock was end of MoP. I did a bit of research before Classic started thought.
---
Usually in the beginning of most dungeons, there is a single mob at the entrance. Just pop Berserker Rage ans auto attack it to a full rage bar. You can keep rolling with a full rage bar. Don't worry about dps-ing with HS, and stop Sundering when close next pull.
---
When your rage decays due to having to wait for a drink, just repeat the process.
---
Also, I'd suggest tanking the early dungeons in a 2H. The rage generation is much nicer.
---
100-120g/hr is probably a little optimistic. Idk, the tribute farm was pretty dependent on how the pathing/kiting works with the add, if it's changed like at all it might no longer be possible. I'm probably just being paranoid though.
---
Hey Priests, thoughts on this [Hypnotic Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7714/hypnotic-blade)+[Orb of the Forgotten Seer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7685/orb-of-the-forgotten-seer) combo vs [Illusionary Rod](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7713/illusionary-rod)?

8 int, 3 spi, +21 SP heal vs 15 int, 10 spi, 7 sta
---
+21 SP vs 7 int, 7 spi, 7 sta
---
Good idea, charge, alt tab, watch youtube, win - alt tab tanking might become a thing.
---
I’m entirely too poor to have cooked food.
---
Demo shout does generate aggro each time it is applied (each time a warrior uses it). However, battle shout spam (buffing a group of 5) will provide more threat than demo shout.
---
yall sound like a murderous snitch
---
If you’re asking this, you will never get enough pvp gear anyway to make it a relevant question. 
---
But to make it quick, BiS is a mix of pvp and pve
---
I think it really depends on what your goals are and what you find fun. Keep in mind, sometimes the leveling experience and the leveling builds of some classes simply just aren't the same as endgame as well. Most classes are pretty bare bones early on and each class starts to take on a lot more life in later levels. 
---
Things to consider: 
---
* Want an easier time leveling? maybe Hunter or mage
---
* Do you want to heal endgame? Tank? DPS?
---
* Do you plan on raiding PvE or are you invested in just PvP?
---
* Ranged or Melee?
---
* etc. etc.
---
When it comes to professions Id simply recommend having one character at least one gathering profession like mining or herbalism and maybe skinning to go along with it until you get to a decent high or max level. When you get capped out, you'll be able to supply funds to a crafting profession. Spending money on crafting is just a big money sink most the time on a first toon until you at least have your mount at 40.
---
But why does the rogue have a fury warriors name?
---
Or you could save yourself the hassle, and look up where the mobs are, be it from an addon or website. It's really not worth the frustration to limit yourself when the resources are readily available.
---
Why was everyone so afraid that a server would be spanish but Gehennas EU is almost full swedish with everyone speaking swedish and everyone is fine with that
---
Undead are only fearless for 5 seconds with a 2 minute cool down.
---
The fault is on blizzard for creating 5 servers to begin with and expecting people to dance around them and move entire interconnected friend groups and guilds time and time again to find a reasonable server.
---
That milk is spilled, blizzard completely fucked it up. Nothing can be done about it now. We are stuck with layering or they are going to have to forcibly ruin budding communities that have really taken hold in the first month of these servers.
---
Layering really isn’t that bad. The whole *point* of removing it is to keep a server feeling like a community and seeing the same people over and over. If you shatter servers into a million pieces a month into the game, you’ve already defeated the entire purpose of removing layering. 
---
The pain doesn’t have to be coming. And personally I seriously doubt blizzard is going to shatter these servers. I bet layering stays until population naturally declines to a place where it’s possible to remove it without increasing queues, if that ever happens
---
I'd like a fact
---
Lifetap lifetap lifetap lifetap "just gonna drain that mana from that priest's pool lol..."
---
Yes I'm talking about 60 and it's definitely not a tiny fraction. Every max lvl dungeon is full of "LFM tank" all day.
---
huh? I am far from sophisticated or early 20s and I fail to see how sexualizing clearly underage women is fine to enjoy?
---
Yes! Please! More of those double roll posts! They are so high effort! MORE!
---
we're no mages or hunters but we do alright. Picking pockets is definitely part of "doing alright" though
---
God damn I wish I could systematically dismantle and destroy someone's argument as well as this.
---
Idk usually horde kills me when I’m 20% hp after pulling a mob. Oh and they’re usually skull level.
---
Yeah starting range of the fight is huge. 
---
Warlocks will have 36 yard range on DoTs and direct damage so completely outranging them is unlikley, but try to stay out of fear and drain life range (24 yards). Between pet pushback and kiting they will have a very hard time casting direct damage and you will win the DPS race vs DoTs. 
---
At this point the warlock has a few choices. They can deathcoil you and hope you run towards them into fear range. Or they can run and try to outrange you while DoTs tick (on both you and your pet), in which case pursue carefully so they don't double back and get within 24 yards. 
---
If you're being ganked where they mount right in on top of you just try to get range before getting feared. Scattershot, pet stuns, FD casts. 
---
If they have a seduce things get worse for you. I'm actually not sure if hunter can win this but it's been a long time since vanilla and I havn't PvPed in classic enough yet.
---
Yeah most elite quests arent that bad, i finished the whole sigil of storms in Arathi Highlands with a 3 man group. Skipping them is missing you a ton of XP, especially the Jinthor'alor quests in Hinterlands.
---
It pleases me to know how much we piss you off :)
---
Well I want to spam bg-s in classic cause im not really interested in pve content. Why isnt it relevant then?
---
&gt;Also, don’t make it all level 60 content, add in plenty of new leveling stuff
---
This right here is the only place I would be concerned that Blizz would fail. But, I think Blizz might also be hyper aware of their shortcomings in the dept for retail. So they may be sure to include it.
---
Nobody "needs" an epic, especially while leveling. 
---
As you saw yourself, expensive epics are for everyone to need. Not sure why this seems to be such a hard concept for certain redditors.
---
Kind of an easy thing to throw out when there are overwhelmingly more DPS in a group / raid than tanks.
---
...and useable.  Some white stuff has a purpose, some does not.
---
So for the pet food as long as you get a carnivore (bear, raptor, cat, boar) you can feed them off mob drops. 
---
The ammo is “expensive” but it is never more than you’re making if you vendor mob trash. 
---
As for the weapon it is a stat stick but it’s also important to have it leveled because if you’re fighting mobs 2-4 levels above your pet the growl won’t always be effective and you’ll be forced to melee unless you drop a trap pre pull so it would be nice to hit the thing that’s hitting you. Any other questions feel to ask
---
How it is buggy? It works perfectly fine for me.
---
Happy Cake Day friendo.
---
Yeah so the results that are showing aren't as good as one might think it is. Removing layering on all servers will increase the queues by a lot?
---
I think for most people, there really is no falling behind until phase 2 comes out, and then it's only for those on PvP servers.  (Leveling from 52-60 is going to be hell after phase 2 on PvP servers due lvl 60s just farming peeps for honor kills.)
---
Sounds like a great opportunity for an RP server. Just make sure to never announce it so it can grow organically.
---
Nice idea, can't work in the current game. In fact, I don't think it can be done at all, not ever, without killing the game.
---
I will expand it and say it can't be done in any game whatsoever.
---
This is surprisingly common.  The other variation is "still deciding".
---
You say in the first week like it's stopped. Or even slowed down.
---
Thanks, very much appreciate the guidance.
---
If you don't mind me asking...when do you find feral charge and bash to be most effective?  Like I see warriors charge in all the time, but it seems like FFF is better for pulling with feral druids and save feral charge for if i lose aggro and need to reach something quickly.
---
No, it's not an assumption, if that person valued the recipe more than gold it's worth they would've already bought it, but they haven't.
---
This leads us to the fact there's 2 possible options
---
* They don't "need" the recipe and are lying to need on it
---
* They "need" the recipe but they still value the gold more at which point the only logical action after winning is selling.
---
Please tell me which other options there are?
---
I remember back in Vanilla I put that on and I felt like a badass.
---
I was also a Warrior...
---
nah, its rather conservative if anything. ofc all this means nothing should they decide to rework dm, but i haven't heard anything suggesting that, so why doubt.
---
You could try RFK. Get your mail helm and corpsemaker
---
This sounds amazing. Even better if it skips the into so the notification you're being ganked is MORTAL KOMBAT
---
nothing, i guess its just the compression and camera quality even tho i videotaped it with a iphone xs 4k
---
i also set the digital colloring to +85%, in person it looks great, i swear.
---
Imagine feelingly so strongly about something that completely comes down to personal opinion that you put down others efforts while at the same time demonstrating to everyone involved that you have no clue what you are talking about.
---
Reputation discount!
---
-Something that allows you to temp-ignore people. There's lots of times where I just want to temporarily filter chat channel messages from someone but don't necessarily want to put him on ignore.
---
-Automatic removal of shapeshift form when trying to do something that requires caster form, but I think someone said this is a protected function in the Classic client.
---
I use the Barov Peasant Caller trinket and Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire on princess.
---
If you're Horde, please don't transfer to Heartseeker. I was thinking the same thing but bit the bullet due to population concerns in P2 on Faer. Horde to alliance literally seems 1:10+ at all times. I was in Gadgetzan with 2 other horde and 30 alliance. I've checked out guilds recruiting, the large ones doing endgame content are mostly full. One of the larger ones invited me, so I joined to actually get a BRD run, and they state we'll be hitting one boss a dps needed then exploiting to farm it - that's a hard pass.
---
Alliance own basically the entirety of the zones. Walking from T. Point to BRD will take around 45-50 minutes and 8 death runs, if you can even find a group, and if most don't log when they can't get out of T. Point or hearth due to the constant corpse camping of 8-9x ally to one horde.
---
I lost my 55 with nearly 500g to this server with no mitigation plan offered by Blizzard. feelsreallybadman
---
Nicely done man.
---
All I can say is, stay the fuck away from dungeons while leveling. It is not worth all the whining and complaining from people. You are doing fine, and when you hit 60, none is expecting you to aoe down massive packs in dungeons, except when its like big non elite packs.
---
Had a lock in my group who would lifetap to 10% health exactly the same time the tank pulled. He did that everytime. I decided to throw him a renew every 3rd or 4th time and only heal him just enough so he wouldn't die. Hadn't healed in years and in leveling spec had enough of a hard time keeping up the tank.
---
And of course he would ask damagemeters after every trashpack.  Ahh warcraft, some things haven't changed in pugs.
---
I see half of Patrick’s head
---
Most people that play classic WoW will agree. Considering every single pug group I've been in from 1-60, and on my 1-30 alt, have done the same.
---
90% of the time this doesn't apply since expensive blues/purples won't drop. In the 10% of the time that they do drop, though, their sell price/rarity is so high that everyone needs.
---
It's the standard for any group who has players that aren't brand new.
---
Wouldn't this just pass on the problem to the server they xfer to? Like if there's a realm that has only horde xferring to it why would anyone roll alliance on that realm? And then if you play horde why would you want to xfer to a realm that is comprised of just your faction?
---
BUSINESS... ETHICS!
---
Sanderson's dialog is renowned for being incredibly cringe inspiring but yeah OK I guess some people have weird tastes.
---
Completely agree with this. Main tanked for an extremely competitive guild throughout BC and WotLK before quitting retail. 
---
The amount of people who expect pats on the back for playing a tank class and then don't put in the time to *learn* how to tank continue to baffle me. You're exactly the same as the DPS you complain about. 
---
Setting the tone and cadence of a dungeon, micro managing your rage + healer's mana, knowing how to make clean, safe pulls, multitanking properly, etc. Most tanks are just really, really bad and don't escalate much past "I used thunderclap where's my aggro". 
---
Most players in all roles are idiots. Adapt and overcome. This is literally the same type of conversation back in the day that originally drove me to tanking.
---
You need battle tag to add someone and I have no idea how did he got your.
---
Ok thanks, I’m gonna go the “tank” build with feral balance and if need be move to HoTW when the time comes for the flexibility needed to heal. Thanks again
---
No. As a druid i get like 5 a day to either heal or tank anf i love it even though i say no most of the time.
---
ZF is just as fast so it shouldnt be a problem.
---
I have tried multiple times to get a group for Gnomeregan, but it seems really hard to find enough members. Is there a specific reason for this or am I just unlucky?
---
Yes and no.  I didn’t help kill the mob, and after taking the appropriate time to laugh at seeing a full health full mana mage try to staff a mob to death while yelling for help, I reminded them that fire spells exist and they got the situation figured out.
---
Nope. I mean. I don't like answering things like this without being 100% sure... but I really really doubt it.
---
Horde &amp; Alliance can't whisper or even communicate properly so I assume they had another account with an alliance toon they hopped on to whisper you with.  Alternately they're in a big cross-faction guild which technically isn't really allowed.
---
I almost always tank or heal. I got to play kitty last night and was dutifully putting up my bleeds etc. Worked out after a while just spamming shred was FAR higher dps.
---
Got mine yesterday at 41. Spent pretty much a whole week mindlessly mob farming for gold. Was all worth it. Cheers!
---
When you're logged in you can log out and still be cached onto the server. You wont actually be disconnected and placed back into queue for like 5 minutes. Even at peak hours I can install an addon, alt F4 to close the game, then instantly log in past the queue with my new addons.
---
I want to be able to mute someone for 24 hours. If there's someone spamming for a stockade run in /lfg I'd love to just mute them till tomorrow. I don't want to put them on ignore as I may want to buy something from them or group up when they're 60 but I don't need that dungeon.
---
Exactly
---
This is well within the intended function of the game, though. Layering within dungeons was a massive failure of Blizzard's development and QA. This is just going into a dungeon and seeing if a mob spawned.
---
This isn't as bad as the titanloot mod letting you know if warglaives would drop, at least.
---
Gnormge
---
Use your brain, until the servers would be balanced
---
I want an add on that prevents the game from saying “not enough rage” or “not enough energy” or “not enough mana”. I already know I don’t have the resource, I’m spamming the button so that when I have it I’m ready, don’t need to be reminded of something like that.
---
Sounds like a healer problem.
---
You can run two instances of WoW from the same bnet account.
---
yeah but youre level 42 talking shit lmaooooooo
---

People are already reposting?
---
demo shout bug week 1 didn't help either
---
I have not had this experience on my mage at all. I hope this does not become the case. I understand people not wanting to only aoe farm and have normal groups for dungeons, but that is really ridiculous they would not let you in the group man. That sucks. Maybe it is just your server, who knows.
---
You didn't read the part where I said he initiated the fight in my original comment.
---
Therefore he'd have chosen the PVP server.
---
Looks like he’s watching YouTube while playing 😂
---
Yeah I was feeling bad for some of the meanness in the last few comment sections so I wanted to break the echo chamber a little.
---
Result? Double the comments despite only 1/10th the upvotes :P
---
So you want people to pass on their best in slot gear because you want it instead. 
---
 Talk about entitlement lol.
---
It's faster, so it hits more often, but not for as much....
---
Of course you dont care but they might, because you're bringing down the group and they cant really say anything.
---
"Mages are the new huntards" isnt a new meta.
---
The meta has always been the sub par classes shitting on the top to make them sleep better at night.

When TBC came around you got Ice Lance and could use *two* buttons.

Good to know.  I’m level 40 at the moment, and things in this level range in below aren’t selling easily
---
I love the KOS list.
---
**Every time** I've been ganked, if I see one of the players that was involved, they have zero interest in fighting and will try to run away while I'm killing them. Even if it's a completely fair fight.
---
People got no balls man.
---
These are mostly world of warcraft exclusive ones, LFM means looking for more, as in to fill out their group.
---
Its grobbulus, but I dunno people are assholes n matter where you go
---
I tryed to cheer up our GM (Enhancement Shaman), because he forgot to Sign Up on Time and didnt want to kick someone to take the Spot. Guess what Eye of Sulfuras dropped. More bad news for him...
---
No way to do this
---
Lvl 30 first time hunter here. Its more of the same that you have herd, bag space is smaller than other races but tbh food is really not to bad especially if you keep a pet for a long time and raise its trust rating up high enough. Ammo is cheap (using razor arrows) and although it is a money sink i see it as breaking even for being able to do most leveling content solo.
---
I think the addon is at fault.
---
Eady way to answer your question. Actually USE the bow and observe the numbers.
---
Research makes the difference. Good on you!
---
Not me! No way I could expect too finish a WC run on a work night at the speed I tank :P
---
Have you reloaded your UI/relogged?
---
Atlas would do that/something similar to me when i would try to open it in combat.  I dont remember if it got fixed at some point, or if i just stopped trying to load it up while in combat.
---
Ugh I'm so sick of this cutesy doggo language.
---
It's not bad that they lifetap, it just bad that they don't eat or drink, like ever.
---
Yeah if this doesn’t get deleted I don’t know what should. This is a real hot take you got bud.
---
Prices were down yesterday to about 23g. Haven’t looked today.
---
He added me and one more in my group. He added me instantly, like before his corpse even hit the ground, so he wouldn't have had time to write it even if he actually did have it. Confused me a lot how he managed to do it as well.
---
If they are the ones I'm thinking of, one of the first things I did when WOTLK came out was run there with a DK and Path of Frost.
---
I’m not sure how bad space equates to “easy going” but ok!
---
You are right, how could I have been so stupid.
---
There’s no way to track layers.
---
Also layers have a cool down now so there’s really no point.
---
The redwood bow has a slower speed, which increases the damage output. At least that’s how I was always told in vanilla, that slower weapons put out a higher damage rating.
---
THIS.
---
FUCK DUNGEONS.
---
They aren't required, in many cases they are worth LESS than questing, unless you have 5-man static group that you are going to chain run the same dungeon 100 times with, getting the pulls picture perfect isn't going to happen. There's going to be massive problems as everyone has a different idea on how to perfectly pull the dungeon.
---
So like they said, FUCK DUNGEONS.
---
I grinded 1-60 only dungeons in the first week of launch, second character I think I have done 3 dungeons... and I am level 55.... I am enjoying the WORLD of warcraft so much more again.
---
I am on alliance, which are outnumbered on my server at least 2:1, which means PvP happens.... a lot.... and I'm outnumbered. Doesn't matter having fun.

I mean, sometimes I'm nervous to pull big packs when I don't know if the team can handle it (after a few pulls you can gauge it anyways), but if your priest **of all people** is telling you that you can speed it up, speed it the hell up! lol.  I understand not wanting to be wiping through the dungeon and ending up taking even longer, but if you aren't even wiping, what the hell are you doing going that slow

Occasionally, when I'm flying over westfall, I like to post in general that DM = Deadmines and watch as the flame war erupts just as I'm leaving the zone.

Because i want to run my own characters through dungeons

As a horde i like the idea of both factions just killing all mages.

Key phrase here is "have to". Most warlock hellfire I tend to see is from the few locks that think hellfire is what you hit when there's 3+ mobs.

And here I forgot about this feature in classic that I really want back now
---
Yea i think it was more the fact that we were carrying this scrub and waiting on him and honestly anyone can say they have tailoring/ Need it.I was treating it like a World drop or something but from what I’m hearing is some people go for a total completion of all the recipes.
---
I fully understand all of that, dude.  All of it.
---
I'm totally okay with them doing layering.  I'm just amused at how they're willing to recreate something as obscure as spell batching, but then change something as core as layers.
---
Thank you, I’ve heard of he popularity of SM/Ruin and this looks good
---
I can confirm that hyjal, caverns of time, behind greymane wall and behind aq wall works in classic. All the old routes seem to work fine
---
Using grenades is a waste now. Never seen anyone use one. Ive killed hundreds of horde. I love this phase as a mage. No one can kill me. Spriests and locks are dangerous, but i can very easily escape from them. Everyone else is easy pickings.
---
So far the most fun is to slow people in lava and let them die to it. Slow lowbies so they get killed by mobs. Bully warriors, untill they give up and then camp them. Shatter combo lvl 50s trying to enter brd.
---
Its also incredibly fun to sheep people trying to run away from mobs on mounts. And just sheep mounted people in general.
---
I love being a mage
---
The trolls have loot tables and relatively low health.  We used to grind them for world drops.

He's allowed to do so, no?

They hated him because he spoke the truth

Left my last guild cause of that shit. Just spammed guild chat with a bunch of bullshit all day only time anybody got promoted was when an officer added and alt to the guild. Was slightly interesting until I hit 58 though

Seems redundant to have a website for PVE. My server already has Molten core 25’s happening.
---
water elementals are the reason i spent like 15g learning all the ranks of Scorch
---
That's great.
---
There could be ... just search for it - that term is not a normal one so you'll either find it or not.  There is a server subreddit for Atiesh that I am on but it doesn't get much activity because there is already a server Discord.
---
Yep, even when I tank the healer controls the pace. I start the pacing but in the long run the healer ends up dictating the size of packs and speed of pulls. A lot of times I won't start drinking until the pull is going to start to keep thing sped up.
---
Long live classic
---
Still working on Darnassus myself. Had a 98% clear one time. Refuse to try the next one until I 100% the previous.
---
I leveled a Hunter to 97 in retail a few months before classic. Prior to may of 2019 I'd never played any WoW. Retail sucks and classic is the tits.
---
"I am just used to doing it that way I guess."
---
How would that have worked anyway?
---
just keep doing 3 hour deadmines runs kid

I kinda did a similar thing with a name theme lmao ..potato for me so potatomage..pally..etcetc
---
big oof. That...seems excessive man
---
Are you a warrior?
---
Mario.
---
A couple things in response.  First, blizzard can't crit, but I rarely use it anyway because flamestrike + arcane explosion is more damage with shatter.  That would ordinarily pull from anyone in a large pull, but tanky boi has force reactive disk with his thorns set so he can get really wild with threat.
---
I would think reasonable locks wouldn’t expect you to stress over it. Tossing a HoT is appreciated. But we can bandage and eat food too
---
Maybe he’s JJ Abrams.
---
You'll need to learn to eventually play with keybinds, as another comment has pointed out. It can take a little time to get used to it and it really is a feel thing for what makes sense to you and what feels comfortable to you in a natural flow for your rotations, depending on your class. 
---
Personally I use 1-5, Shift 1-&gt; Shift 4, V, ctrl-V, Shift-V, X, Z, G, T, Shift-T, Shift-G, mouse scroll up, mouse scroll Down, Shift MS up, Shift MS down, as well as two mouse buttons which I also bind with ctrl/shift as well.
---
We did a guild run of deadmines when we were all 20's.  Waiting for the last of the group to fly into gromgol on the zep. Figured "well its right next to a camp, im bored, that thing over there cant be too bad"
---
Right as i enter aggro range i realize that crocolisk is "??".  first guild milestone was taking down a level 36 (as we found out later) crocolisk, with only two deaths even!
---
This is so delusional. I've been griefed by so many alliance players while levelling. World PVP attracts griefers on both factions.
---
What's your point?
---
That the masses don't read enough, and they often falsely credit TV/movies for stories that have been around for decades?  
---
Agreed.
---
aaaand these are the groups you avoid. Might be a new player though.
---
Yep, you sort of need to feel out a tank at the start if you have never grouped with him before. 
---
Excluding 3 mage spell cleave which is extremely fast but usually involves forming a group that knows exactly what they are getting into. I don't really have a preference on which tank-style they use. If they prefer to focus packs down with a kill order then I don't see it any worse than if they prefer to cleave. Both are pretty similar in pace from my experience and I think it's in the best interest of the group to let the tank play the style he is most skilled at because if the tank isn't playing well the group isn't playing well. Tanking is a hard role and arguably the most punishing when you make mistakes.
---
All I ask of Tanks is to understand you guys all play very differently from each other and we DPS sometimes need a few pulls to adjust.
---
Holy Weaving is definitely a thing.
---
My VC runs take 30 minutes, tops.
---
Does anyone have recommended MMO mice? I have really small child size hands, which is why I don't see key binding all my abilities possible.
---
Well if it's a random dude, it's not really "a friend" as you said in your previous content, now, is it?
---
If Vanilla paladins had any resemblance to WotLK paladins, they would probably be the most played class. Unfortunately, not the case.
---
yeah... you use it once you lose aggro
---
Melee leeway is more infuriating for me as a warrior. Literally can't hamstring kite.
---
To be honest i feel like he’s kind of partly responsible for ruining the experience of grouping for everyone.
---
MD was tbc
---
Magetard
---
EU server?
---
Classic.
---
60% of the time, this trick works every time!
---
I've experienced this a few times but not enough to be real bother.  It's when I'm healing melee cleaves that it becomes a real pain.  We're smearing the mobs as it is with strength of earth and windfury totems, a bit of extra attack power doesn't make much of a difference
---
&gt;So what are some good sources?
---
Typically just google something with "Classic WOW" at the end, if you're searching up a quest that you struggle with, something like "&lt;QuestName&gt; Classic WoW" will return 2-3 results that relate to classic. Same logic applies to classes/professions, so "&lt;Class Build Guide&gt; Classic Wow" to find good builds for your character. 
---
WoWhead/Classicdb are the best sources I've found. 
---
&gt;Also, i am sorry for all the dumb stuff i do, like not knowing how to group people or killing something important, etc
---
You learn this slowly, even coming back to the game people make a ton of mistakes.
---
What's important is that you learn from them, and don't flame people too much for their own mistakes.
---
I promise if this guy wanted 60 he’d have it already easy with the same /played. Why are yall so salty over this. Its cool he lvld so many characters to 30 relax
---
Golemagg :)
---
It's an addon that tracks quest objectives and where they're found.
---
It's a great zone if you're playing correctly, the mob density is really good.
---
I do have ambush as a part of a macro, I have it set to ambush and then switch my dagger with my sword. I don't think that's the issue tho because it works perfectly fine on non-sapped targets.
---
Hell yeah, convenient additions to reduce social interaction!
---
Wait, where have I heard that before....
---
I’m just throwin stuff out there man no need to be a negbomb
---
I quite often see "LF GNOME TANK!" in tradechat. I like to chastise them for excluding the other races in their party, as a human warrior I'm perfectly able to tank too, and also it'd be nice if they said where they want to take this gnome tank...
---
Magetards
---
Free isn’t better?
---
There's a ton of gear that's not intended for a class but people need on it.
---
Prime example: Robes of the exalted - https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13346/robes-of-the-exalted
---
Every single healer in the game wants it. Paladin, priest, shaman, druid doesn't matter. There's no better pre-raid than that.
---
The difference being if you are completely UNABLE to equip something, by all means don't roll for it. But if you can use it, and it's an upgrade you should be good to go.
---
The few exceptions are things such as the hand of justice trinket, I don't see why hunters would want it, if it's a melee only proc (obviously not intended for them so let the melees have it)
---
If you could hire bounty hunter and put contract on people... I would totally be on a pvp server.
---
Can't mail BoP gear
---
We can make one but u can lead
---
I've been seeing people say that for years on private servers now, and each on thinks theyre *so funny and original*
---
At 60 sure.  At 20 no.
---
I just had this discussion with another warrior in my guild.  He has the 36 dps ww axe, I have a 30 dps 1.7 speed dagger.  We had the same spec. I out damaged him more times than not, because neither of us has MS.
---
Thank you mucho
---
Need those Triprunner dunagrees.
---
so let me get this straight, they artificially created some spellbatching queue to make it seem like classic.  But it only introduced a shit ton of yet-discovered bugs, without even seeming classic.
---
Flight timers
---
I feel like you might be looking at a post-Cataclysm guide.  I don't think Forest Song was a thing until Cataclysm came out.
---
Yes. You need to go there for a quest to get the scepter to ring the gong. Not a lot of people have done that part of the quest, and I almost quit when I got there because I didn't get the buff.
---
I did all that back in Wrath, and finished it a few weeks before it went away. It was one of the coolest things I've done in the game even if it wasn't really something I could complete. I kinda want to do it again, but I doubt I'll have a whole guild supporting me on it like I'd need.
---
It used to take a shaman casting water walking on a mounted player to get there before fatigue claimed you. So I don't think aquatic form can do it.
---
I’m the opposite I’ve been leveling my rogue finally close to 40, and I got a lvl 12 mage that I blast through the content with for fun.
---
Drop Target will still go to queue and leave combat will be instant for same bugged result.
---
Not at all. NEED is called need because you need it. Especially when you are running with randoms. If you are running with friends and want to give it to your friend because it’s a bigger upgrade then that makes you a pal. But it’s not expected at all.
---
&gt;it's not really "a friend"
---
Who the hell cares? Not even going to argue about how easy the system is to break? 
---
All it takes is one austist to be reliable with paying out any bounties he claims to the bountee(?) and then the whole thing is fucked beyond repair.
---
Congrats!
---
It isn't simply because mages can blink and avoid aggro altogether.
---
What tree? (hee hee)
---
For the Horde!
---
One subscription one online character at a time.
---
Not salty at all. It's a good debate that hasn't been salty full of name calling. Mathematically we are trying to figure it all out
---
You and me both, brother: [My lock](https://imgur.com/a/f0iJl6V)
---
Thanks for the quick reply. I'm skinning/tailoring and have thought about dropping skinning for herbalism. Only reason I haven't dropped skinning yet is because most non-humanoid mobs are beasts. I'm sure reaching 300 herbalism wouldn't be that difficult since I do have my mount already.
---
wait till you respec at 40 and get shadowform and your mount. oh man
---
Grats!! I just hit 40 too, don't have my mount yet, I'm at 60g but I just dropped enchanting and lvled up skinning to make some cash faster. Only took about 3 hrs to get up to 225 skinning.
---
Oh man I honestly can't remember. It was forever ago haha
---
&gt;at 60 I can make 1g within a few mins of skinning, not so much with lvl 10.
---
I dont think this sounds as good as you think. So the price to go to a city which for the alliance is usually free is go farm a few minutes?
---
Im not disagreeing with you overall. I never played alliance. Im just pointing out something that is a lot better for the alliance
---
Knew I couldn't be the only one.
---
Yeah, this seems to be a major problem for some reason.
---
Could you do that for me please.

I just dont heal them when they do that BS soultap shit

All you're doing is swapping your mana for your healers mana.

He is healing in Raids, but only Rolls/LC for Enhance Gear.

They all rolled need? 😟
---
Now I get that it was bugged and never this way in vanilla but the 'front stab' mechanic added so much tension and manual skill to leveling a druid (and rogue). There was always that tiny bit more efficiency that you could eek out with better controls, I really miss it.

Your STV days are far from over at 40 i'm afraid.  You should have some good Swamp of Sorrows and Dustwallow Marsh quests at this point.  Having skinning will make you bank at this point because a lot of these quests involve the dragonkin in these zones.

Oh its not gunna happen huh? Just like classic would never get official servers huh.
---
Dumbass opinionated lil bitch fuck outta here
---
Curious. When you dungeon crawled from 58-60, did you respect into a more healing spec? Or were you a hybrid spec before that?
---
As a fellow rogue, this described my plight.  55-60 has been awful.  Quested in E. Plaguelands as much as I could.  Quests are now few and far between at 59.  I've basically been grinding BRD but getting in groups has been very difficult with this AOE meta.  Still haven't managed to get a group for LBRS, Strath, or Scholo.  Quest log is still full of dungeon quests for BRD, LBRS, UBRS, etc.
---
It's rough.  I feel ya.
---
YES. I love finding those places.
---
Grats man. One of the biggest milestones in the whole game, for sure.
---
Just when I thought you couldn't break the hunter class any more you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourselves!
---
Is this the same guy who said he wasn't going to beg for anything and then proceeded to beg for money and items?
---
I'd never roll on something that I cant equip of course, but I'm just confused why several people in a dungeon got upset at me for rolling on something that had spirit (I'm a tank) but nevertheless, was an upgrade (and not a negligible upgrade). I'm totally open to being wrong so I can do better in the future. What do you think?
---
Just remember there will no expansions, and they are doing the legwork for you.
---
Once you’re 60 you can use these lifeless losers to down raid bosses faster and easier.
---
I honestly feel bad for people who already hit 60

So leme get this straight. There's no way for some hyper nerd to have 2 accounts to advertise on the horde side? There's no way that'd be possible? 
---
There're no server forums? There aren't any server discords? There aren't any server subreddits? There's simply no way to contact anyone on the opposite faction? News to me
---
I used to have this whole song memorized, good times

Whats the name on it?

---
I actually had no issues with 30-40 for the most part; I had much more of a struggle from 21-30. I was spending a lot of time grinding out xp and farming monsters with decent enough bag space so I didn't have too many issues with having to find a vendor. Sounds like you either had too small of bags or you had too much unnecessary stuff in the bags
---
 However the 40-45 range is feeling like it's gonna be rough. Potential spots feel so spaced out for questing and are kind of overcrowded in places like tanaris for me. I might just have to grind out the few couples or spam some instances to get some xp.
---
I would love to heal a decent 2h tank.  90% of pulls are 1 or 2 heals, a couple sw:p, and wanding.
---
"how to serve man" is an episode of twilight zone. its a great one if anyone hasnt seen it.
---
Benefit, in this context, means progression on the character and specifically gold quantity when it comes to selling portals. The mage not only spent the silver on the runes but also is spending their time advertising the portals and actually making them.
---
I become slightly panicked when I have full health and mana. Tapping is pointless because I don't need the mana. Drain Life is inefficient because you only do the damage part of the effect. 
---
I usually just tap anyway, much to the confusion of my healers.
---
&gt;You're confusing "what's possible" with "what percentage of the players would do it."
---
You think people are going to just randomly throw gold bounties on people? Who's most likely to get big bounties on them? The turbo nerds. Who's going to absolutely figure out a way to break it?
---
I *loooooooooooooooooove* when other players 6+ lower levels attack my healer.
---
MC, Fear, and Bubble bitches. You are going to dance for me until you die.
---
Meanwhile you're just bitching about how other people are bitching.

WoW. They did a poor job with that prediction I guess. I do indeed have the trinket and all. Phase 5? Man, that would be too long to wait for that trinket.
---
u look like ur humping a horse
---
hella weird
---
Get Zygor addon and make a fresh character once its loaded up. You'll get the hang of things and start leveling really quickly, and if u want u can then take the training wheels off but I'm using it all the way to 60
---
you can disband the guild, the guild name is forever locked to your chat so no one else can steal it even if you delete the guild.

Im on  grobbulus unfortunetly. But i appreciate the tips.

Nah you're not a Night Elf, you're a Moonkin

What's an afag? Apparently it's yours.

Muh retail mindset.
---
girl fart compilation videos are an art but yes point taken
---
That's the real reason he leaves the group.
---
Do you have any addons that may interfere with seeing any changes?
---
I agree. I have been thinking the same thing.
---
It's so annoying when I'm sitting there drinking to get mana, and the warlock just lifetaps and stands there. You're not using that mana until I'm done anyway and we have a mage!
---
Great tips!
---
Level 20, you can be running around Stonetalon, as well as late Silverpine quests. WC is nice but once you finish the quests and get the gear you wanted, you shouldn't be there anymore. Someone with more experience can give better answers to which zones to go to. 
---
Personally, I use Atlasloot for Dungeon info. It just lets you know which bosses drop which items as well as the recommended levels. When I'm close to the minimum dungeon requirement, I go to the zone it's in and quest around, as well as gather the dungeon quests, until I can run it. I get what I need, finish the quests. And go back to questing. Go as far as I can in that zone and move on.
---
A lot of times, once you get so far in a zone, there will be quests that make you deliver something to a new zone. Then you quest there. And so forth.

She’s so legendary that at this point I hope Blizzard will make a statue of her for the Blizzcon.

/ignore the haters, it works wonders. Even better if they try to message you again, so they can see that *Player is ignoring you*
---
I like to think he wanted to spell Panther but failed at that too
---
I agree the match up is much more one-sided than mage/hunt. But Vanilla pvp is less about planned balanced pvp and much more about chaos.
---
Tons of hunter pvp videos on youtube check them out
---
I think lore wise too the gnomes are a kinder race, and you don’t find much fighting within gnome civilization.
---
Same, but I touched privates...
---
This happened to me back in OG vanilla.  Was running a warrior, and I needed the drops from Herod.  Kept spamming "LFG SM armory.", and one guy whispered me telling me what an idiot I was for thinking SM had parts to it that you could run individually.  He said something along the lines of "it's one instance, moron.  Learn to play".  I didn't respond, but it was funny as hell.
---
We could make it O.o We doin this boys?
---
I would stay away from pvp get some gud gear for now bro. When the first season hit you'll be ready. Or whatever just do some wild pvp who cares.
---
pls tell me, who are the ppl like me 
---
you bought that useless ring too didnt you :D, dont worry big boi, im pretty sure you can down ragnaros now, maybe even onyxia if you get second one xD
---
I don't heal those ppl. Its nice you can have pretty numbers in your dps meter, but tank that lives is more important. If you spam life tap for most of your health, you deserve to die.
---
One reason to do it this way in a spell cleave is if you are resetting the instance after the first group - waiting around for them to respawn slows down your XP.
---
\#gategate
---
He goes on record many times saying retail is shit lol, he’s a popular streamer and gets 100K viewers every now and then  it’s not realistic to assume he’s not gonna get loot and gold thrown at him by viewers. I enjoy asmon for what he is an entertainer I don’t understand why people hate his guts so much he’s trolling most of the time and people don’t understand it in 2019 lol
---
People are fucking stupid. I'm leveling a lock and a priest. 
---
It's not retail, let the tank get a stack and stop unbinding assist target. 
---
Just stop inviting mages to groups until they learn. #boycottmages
---
My level 40 undead rogue looks like a potato

In 1.1 this was true.  Not so much in 1.12.

UNNECESSARILY LONG EXPLANATION AS TO WHY YOUR UNRELATED PLANKTON COMMENT IS EITHER FACTULLY, LOGICALLY, OR CONTEXTUALLY INCORRECT, WITHOUT ANY CITATION AND WITH AT LAST TWO TYPOS
---
This happens to me every time I enter the graveyard wing.
---
What if it's an upgrade for your current spec, say as a tank warrior, but has spirit and is therefore not necessarily intended for your spec?
---
U speak the truth iam a mage btw
---
Right? He complains that he isn't even motivated enough to get a few levels then calls other people out who are clearly motivated to get to 60 and are enjoying the game for not playing the way he thinks they should.  
---
There isn't even a question in his post, it's just a rant that he's salty other people are enjoying the game more than he is.
---
It's not movable by default.
---
No problem, it’s one of my favorite shows glad to be of help. Enjoy the rewatch!
---
Hard disagree
---
These specs put much too much stress on the healers. Just accept prot into your hearts and stop being filthy dps warriors.
---
I wish Dark Pact and Life Tap were channeled like Health Funnel. It's annoying having to spam the same ability. I'm sure I'm not the only one in the dungeon getting bored of hearing the same FTOOSH every second.
---
I thought only questing addons are fucked.. :D
---
I mean I don’t see the reason for them to add the indicator. You’ll know you need to resub when you can’t play classic anymore.
---
That raid portal in Stratholme
---
I found it difficult to make friends on a full server (Whitemane) as it just felt like retail-lite - everyone was busy trying to get shit done because they had to wait in queue all day.
---
Recently moved to a low pop (Arcanite Reaper, which I believe is the lowest pop) and I've been making friends left and right. It might help that I'm one of the few high levels on the server, but it's much more of a community.
---
SPELL ALERT! If there is a spell alert addon for classic, I have yet to find it.
---
What should horde do, then? Don't engage in world PvP? But that's the entire point of rolling on a PvP server!
---
This happened to me too, healer would immediately get aggro on all adds except for the one add the tank was quintuple sundering. Poor dude had to heal while getting smacked by, at some points, 6+ whelplings in ST. We ended up bonding over how terrible of an experience that run was.
---

No my chair only goes so far back.

No, yeah of course you can't go up and down but you can hop on a mast and blink to the next? Ive tried a ton to get up there and can't find a way. Idk. Just throwing out my 2 cents.
---
𝔏𝔪𝔞𝔬
---
I have literally never seen any of this happen and people are acting like it's a regular occurence. I don't think it's real. People just need something to bash.
---
I did a run like that earlier and the tank didn't hold aggro anyway. Joined midway because the healer DCd. I'm suspecting he just left.
---
Yes but the entire point of this thread is you shouldn't force this mentality on your unsuspecting group when they are doing a traditional run.
---
I’m leveling spamming arcane missiles so I’m not burned out when I hit 60 spamming frostbolt.
---
That's all we (the non-braindead) warlocks could ever ask for! Just pop a hot on us and we'll figure out the rest, whether it's eating bandaging or using cannabilism (one of the most useful racials in classic imo). Make the bad ones learn, give them renew and when they die tell from mismanagement, tell them to figure it out lol.
---
&gt; Most players just want to get it over with and start raiding.
---
I'd like to see a source on that, considering you are the one making the claim :)
---
I have a friend who speaks English very fluently as a second language and is one of the smartest people I know, but sounds like a dumbass in chat. He knows this and named his character "Dumb". This sounds like something he would say as he is also very impatient lol
---
The link above is a drain-tanking guide.  It has been changed from Voidwalker.
---
Then don’t fucking play it like what do you want man? 
---
Internet speeds are 5-100x faster than they were 15 years ago. People are playing at max frame rate as opposed to like 9 FPS. we’ve had 15 years to figure out why we were so shit back then.
---
First thing I do is whisper the warlock and tell him "fuck my mana"
---
Let that little fucker life tap to his heart's content. I'm trying to get through this bitch quick
---
That makes sense. Thanks.
---
That's great haha
---
Ammo expensive, bag space treacherous, constant inv management. Id kill to reroll at same lvl on a rogue but at 48 im just trying to finish it out
---
I like how you're all getting worked up and putting words in my mouth.
---
Your time will be after phase 2 when pvp really starts
---
Quit then, no one cares.  We don't need you coming here to cry about everything.  There needs to be a reporting option for "crying like a baby".
---
I'm not planning to solo any dungeons as Hunter, but after witnessing my 48 tank shaman's success I'm leveling up a tank Hunter alt LOL.  Wish me luck!  Hopefully the Survival tree plus traps and a ton of Dodge chance from agi and Aspect of the Monkey will serve me well.  My pet being able to take hits later on will hopefully make an impact too; I guess I should opt for a turtle or something with AoE.
---
I read something that strongly indicated that shout application for hunter/warlock pets also contributes
---
Good porn title.
---
Fuck you and die.
---
Really interesting insight there. I feel like WoW expansions moved progressively further away from making you feel like a "small cog" in any interaction.
---
Really highlights the change in tone over time.
---
U dune gon a a ron
---
all my friends and everyone I try to dungeon with are at level 54-58 and have stayed there for over a week now... I’m level 60 holy priest and my back hurts....

Thanks for the clarification!

---
After receiving the rod, you can stop there. The rest of quests in that chain don't have that great of rewards anyways.
---
You can right click and add battle tag friend
---
Yeah you are re-selling those mats to the same person who DE'd in the first place. If Gold is a reason to need something you mayaswell need on everything from grey to epic anyway - the reason enchanters need mats between lvl 1 and 255 is to level it up.. I don't see the issue in taking BoP Greens to DE if they were going to get vendored for 20s anyway.
---
I wonder if they'll do the same in the book if TWOW gets released. Gotta suck to be a translator when dealing with reveals like that
---
24 hour.
---
First, that's fucking awesome.  You've got a lot of gnomes left to boot.
---
Second, I've never gone away from the default UI; I guess I just got used to it.  But the cleanliness of yours is astounding.  The main spells front and center, other stuff off in the periphery.  If I may ask (and even if I mayen't), what addon are you using?  I think I might just have to go away from the comfort zone to find a new comfort zone.
---
INSULT
---
Mechanics aren’t ignored. People are just able to better gauge what works and what doesn’t thanks to over a decade of practice on private servers. Rotations have been refined and people are playing their classes better than before.
---
Screech op as tank so ya anything with screech prob but its really not THAT big of a deal. Alot of people forget to factor training points also
---
I dunno about the awesome DPS part though... I rolled a Warlock and have topped the DPS charts in every Dungeon so far. Even with mages 1-2 levels higher than me. 
---
n00bs
---
I know it's a recurring and nitpicky thing.  But why is it so difficult to roll a fantasy name instead of the reddit and yahoo handles I see all across the world.
---
You know... that makes a lot of sense but I would never have thought of that. Do you keep the default RMB to rotate or do you use something else for rotation?
---
TBC is fun, but we know where that road leads. I would rather they build a future for classic wow instead of slowly killing it again.
---
Cannibalism is the only thing that makes me sometime wish I had rolled undead instead of Orc.
---
Dam Herods got the cheap orbs
---
There are going to be people missing occasionally.  The system should be set up to accommodate that.
---
If every single person is on an alt, yeah that's an issue.  But if alts are banned but the raid is still inviting randos to fill in?  That's weird and less than fair to the regular raiders that would occasionally like to make the game less monotonous.  And yeah, the determined ones are going to figure out how to do it anyway, so the people losing out are the ones who were upfront with their alt names.
---
Yeah, the majority of people under 60 right now are hot garbage at the game. I took a week off after hitting 44 because I had to go on a work trip, came back, and it was a clown fiesta. Luckily I had some guildies straggling behind the pack and we got our shit together, but man I do not envy pugs right now.
---
I don’t know what rotation spamming arcane explosion is. You used to die when you did that.
---
Old rates I believe, assuming you're talking about things like Gandling's Staff or Rivendare's Mount, they're incredibly low drop rates.
---
As a healer. I will heal an aggro pulling DPS the first time. Then I just let you die
---
You can just buy the ring from a warlock or hunter, it's really cheap too.
---
Cosplay. Simple "Undress" button in dressing room. There were also a "target" button to use the target's model!
---
We should be ashamed of wearing those pants outside...
---
I’ve never seen a leveling guide that wasn’t a useless waste of time.
---
Protip. Everything looks badass in shadowform.
---
Try /lfg, /world, /trade, or make your own and advertise in the 3. I guarantee if you advertise you will get 3 or 4 of 5 pretty quickly, and you can send tells to the appropriate class/level to get the 4th/5th.
---
It takes effort to do this, and some people will not be happy that you sent them a tell offering a group (buggers me why, I accept some tells I get like this), but you will be on your way in less than 10 minutes.
---
I beg healers to leave me at 75%, at this point I’m more comfortable there
---
What was the item?
---
Honestly, I've had this issue with backstab against gouged enemies. Try running around the enemy and spamming ambush?
---
You are ready for Felwood and Western Plaguelands.
---
Your iphone can video tape? Bruh you hipster af!
---
Whether new content will be aimed exclusively at raiders or also include 1-59.
---
Its not that hard and the higher ur lvl the easier it is dont worry about it
---
Every expansion had something like that...
---
Just buy it from someone that solos this for gold anyway. I sell the ring for 30 because we are on a smaller server and I can because there aren't that many people doing it but on the mega pvp servers I assume it's like 20 gold only.
---
RMB yes! Works quite well :)
---
But the top DPS isn't coming to that progression night.  That character isn't playing that night.  
---
If I'm playing a character on a given night, I'm playing the character regardless of going to the raid.  I'll go run a 5 man or something for a drop instead if a raid invite doesn't happen.  Time is limited and the top dps character should have put enough time towards helping progression to miss a raiding night occasionally.

That's a stupid lock. Adding pointless healing threat to you right when the tank is pulling and trying to gather aggro?

It's so strange to see only one guy in such a big place
---
I'm doing this ATM with 5 characters. Leveling my main normally and once every 2 weeks I crank out 2 levels of rested on my Mage, Hunter, Rogue and Shaman! ATM I am working on getting them all to 15 - so I can max out 150 professions.
---
The real goal for me isn't 60 but 35 though. I want 5x Arcanite and 5x Mooncloth each CD
---
Can’t you just regroup?
---
My buddy mains a warlock and I heal and I barely have to heal him at most I through a hot on him
---
How do I open on a mage? I'm a 39 rogue and when I do PvP I struggle with mages in particular (paladins I don't even bother). They just kite me for miles even though I'm spec'd into improved sprint for slow removal.

No one wants to buy any leather till heavy now

PHASE 2 CMON!

On the PVP servers, at the Scarlet Monastery, the Horde will graciously accept all Alliance with open arms and be hospitable hosts.  Especially the nice welcoming we all received by Alliance in Hillsbrad in our 20s.

Take my upvote.

The entire literal foundation of nelf society on teldrassil is rotting from underneath them.  Their leadership is split between an envious manchild (fandral) whom is making deals with Ragnaros, a googley eyed queen wannabe thats too busy lamenting the fact that shes in a relationship with a guy who sleeps all day, and the guy who literally sleeps all day.
---
Because I played at launch and I play now, so I noticed how crowded zones became despite same numbers players being in such zone.   
---
And also you can notice it when you try to swap layers, I am playing on Full Eu realm and we tried with some guildies to layer hob and see how many unique layers we can get. During prime time we were able to find 3-4 unique layers, while 1-2 weeks into the launch there were easly more than 10.
---
So is [Holy Diving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhGEGIBGLu8).
---
I literally always wait no reason not to
---
So he's not actively rolling on healing gear?
---
I hardly call pointing out your misunderstanding of this situation a "strawman". I dont know if I can break this down any more ganularly...
---
Every class can cast spells/abilities
---
Those spells/abilities use a resource
---
Said resource is not finite, one does NOT require water. Mana regens naturally.
---
Every class has an auto attack. Casters even have a ranged auto attack. 
---
The above are all constants barring durability, again which all classes have.
---
Hunters have spells and abilities
---
The vast majority of which require ammo to use
---
Hunters can not wait 5 seconds and start to regain lost ammo
---
Hunters cant auto attack from range with a wand when out of ammo as one with out mana could
---
Hunters can melee when out of ammo, as could a mage when out of mana, but why would a mage do that when you have a wand
---
I was simply pointing out that hunters have an added cost of operation. Your statement compared mana to arrows, which is possibly the most vapid comparison one could make given the topic. Considering food and water can literally be conjured out of thin air. 
---
If anyone is defensive here, it's you, and with good reason. Your entire position is made of straw. Too bad I'm out of arrows or I would shoot through it even more! Maybe if I were a mage I could just wait a few seconds to regen enough mana to burn it down with a fireball!
---
Yeah, I didn't think healing on my priest was particularly difficult, but I can only imagine people are running in to tanks who haven't updated parts of their armor in 10 levels or something.
---
*You must construcy additional pylons*
---
"Which parts of BRD are you doing?"  
---
"Yes"
---
Ya 1080p here. That might be it!
---
There's no such thing as a "proper rotation" in PVP, that's for PVE (mostly dungeons and raids).
---
In PVP you have to try to anticipate what the opponents are trying to do and counteract them, and that all depends on the class you're fighting against.
---
Also leveling guides are mostly for PVE content, they won't help you much for PVP, you have to search for PVP guides, specifically for how to fight those classes that are killing you.
---
Okay awesome thanks!
---
I'll cannibalize if there's humanoid corpses. Maybe after the tank dies because the healer went oom from healing me?
---
Same happened to me.. and ofc we had to go explore. Ended up HS’ing and getting kicked from the group as a result. Awesome.
---
yeah lmao, its not even a literal translation of Stormwind, as that would be "Vento da Tempestade" (names based on germanic languages doesnt really make much sense when translated to spanish or portuguese)
---
The enchanting wands are soooo good early levels but also sooo boring.
---
Yeah I thought about the "trial and error" method, but the problem there is that I am still saving for my mount, and dont want to put them in "too high" because if they dont sell, I lose the AH cut on a multiple gold sale, that I never made
---
I was in a group with a shaman tank last night, he did extremely well. He had no problem holding aggro at all even against multiple targets. In 3 full runs of SM he lost aggro maybe 2 times at the most. And on top of that he did almost the exact same DPS as my hunter. Yes they have to stop and drink but so does the healer usually. Stopping for about 10 seconds to drink isn’t really a problem IMO.
---
Didnt know sexymap do it, ty

How about some food then?

Bonereaver's edge is probably what he is talking about.  That or Spinal Tap.  Both are good for warriors.

Not quite the right place for this, but shout out to Quissy for all of those Wowhead articles. She has almost single handedly created WoW Classic guides on wowhead and they are always insightful and useful. She has been my Wikipedia of WoW more or less. If you're out there shoutout to you Quissy, you're the Queen!
---
We did SM lib 3x last night with a Shaman tank and we had no problems. He lost aggro like twice.
---
I spam bids and sometimes get cloth and stuff at a steal so it's their loss. 
---
My 20 stacks sell out *every* cycle so these idiots are just leaving money on the table, for me to take, which I am happy to do.
---
There's a spellcast queue built into the Classic engine so if you mash on a spell before the current one ends, it'll start the next spell as soon as you finish casting.
---
I don't think it works for channeled spells though, it'll just end the current channel and start a new one.
---
I'm with you.  As a druid who usually heals. Moonfire CC all day. Ain't no one got time for that shit.
---
This is the reason classic+ is such a good idea. Plenty of unused assets.
---
Oom

&gt;Look out gnome!! Oh no he cant hear us ~~he has Airpods in~~ his Vent is muted. oh my god

OK then back to fishing
---
I felt the same way as my server is roughly 2:1 and you get mobbed, I've been in an 8v1 in STV before and they dominate all of the contested areas. I re-rolled rogue and have been having fun ever since ;)
---
I'm pretty sure that the issue must be my stats addon. I unequiped both and the stats didn't even change at all. Guess I'll try looking for a different addon.
---
Yeah I know what you mean, I have life tap bound to shift + mousewheeldown so it kinda does the channeling effect with the  mouse I have (Logitech G502 that, unlocked the scroll wheel)
---
Personally I want every recipie in the game even if I never use it, I want to be able to.
---
Pure evil
---
RealMobHealth but its not perfect
---
If youre gonna get one addon get ClassicCastbars it will show you what spell the enemy is casting
---
What other stats did it have on it? Int/stam? Or spirit/stam/str?
---
I use all my spells :) more fun that way.  Frostbolt range speced so it first, then fireball, then scorch, cone of cold flamestrike.  But I also felt visually dupped when I double frostbolt and the blue goes away I thought when I started I was taking some of the slow off.

Can someone explain to me how the instance lockouts work, specifically for BRD?  If a group I'm in kills a few bosses, but not full clear, can we reset the dungeon and start over?  Or is it locked for 5 hours? 
---
No need to shitpost on public forums
---
PRESS ALT-Z TO SHOW IT AGAIN.
---
Yes easily.
---
They say lower level Alliance zones were done first and they took their sweet time doing it so they had to speed things up for the rest of it.
---
And it's totally obvious with the amount of travel and long ass stories in early Alliance quests. Horde already has some of these long travel quests that are supposed to make the world seem big to the player but Alliance takes it to another level.
---
Also what the fuck is up with dungeons? Horde has everything right at their feet. SFK, RFK, RFD, Scarlet Monastery are next to everything for them. Even BFD is closer for them once they take the walk through Ashenvale.
---
Next up is the combination of quest hubs and flight paths. Alliance on Kalimdor is a joke. Horde only need to have one long ass travel to get the Badlands flightpath. Alliance on Kalimdor feels like you're doing that run about 20 times. 
---
I just hit 30 in Duskwood. Will now have to go to Menethil and cross the sea by boat then walk through Dustwallow Marsh, Southern Barrens and Thousand needles just to get to the raceway to gain a level. Mirage Raceway is the cherry on top the Horde get right after questing in 1k Needles right next door. 
---
The next issue is STV which I plan on skipping as much as I can for one simple reason- no flightpath throughout the whole zone except in Booty Bay. Horde get a zeppelin ride and a flight path is waiting for them right under that zeppelin tower to take them across the whole zone. Alliance is walking ofcourse.
---
I'm gonna stop right here because this is getting ridiculously long and with each passing level it's getting more clear why Blizzard decided to put in many more graveyards and flightpaths as well as more streamlined quest hubs later in the game.
---
I just got the Corsair scimitar pro which I’ve enjoyed and also has 12 side buttons. Plus they’re on an adjustable slider to move forward or back

Why do you say that?

I am firmly a fan of TBC, but I would be lying if I said I never wanted to see DKs made available.  Wrath DKs were some of the most flavorful classes.

---
Twitch client / curseforge. It's still a bit wonky when it comes to finding the right addons and the right versions, but you can use it and have it download/update right to the folder
---
I don’t know if they handle it well tbh. They sure did avoid gear inflation but also made gear completely meaningless in doing so. Most players doing end game content eventually end up with alts or storage tabs filled with superfluous top tier gear. I love the franchise and honestly don’t know if I would prefer a new gear grind each expansion though, don’t have any real experience in that regard.
---
Awesome thanks for the help everyone I’m gonna respect now and get on the grind. I also really appreciate the google doc sheet on drain tanking it’s what I had in mind but I couldn’t find anything solid online. Happy hunting everyone!
---
Can you make it alert when anyone of a specific class is nearby?
---
Sounds great tbh
---
Except when you get into pvp and a warlock just spam fears you with dots.

That vid is awesome
---
f is assist target, absolutely not useless.
---
unfortunately no. Same boat here.
---
I play rogue only. I can not speak for warlock players at all so I will not assume that a warlock is willing to summon, and am grateful if any are willing to summon.
---
This is the worst segment for leveling a warrior. Try to squeeze by to lvl 48 doing stv, tanaris, feralas, and zf runs. Once you hit 48 you can do maraudon and hinterlands. At 50 new quest zones open like wpl, un goro, felwood, azshara. Those should get you to BRD which you can run till 60
---
&gt; As long as you make frequent vendor/AH trips when convenient,
---
But then you're investing time into it which completely defeats the purpose.
---
not saying addon sucks, just saying this one is nothing more than a minimalist/ F2P looking UI replacement. Some guy at blizz spent his time drawing an bad ass icon for your empty spell slot and you just replace it for a black square
---
Mam, I don’t appreciate your foul language.
---
I’m glad I play horde and haven’t seen any of this

Chickenhome provided many hours of fun from that very spot

I can't even find elvui on twitch

at 255 he'll teach runecloth belt... but that's it

Faction changes would be very very "un-Classic" but I'd still prefer this solution over the current faction misbalance.
---
Anger is hard for 51s though
---
Alliance players personally help fandral keep malfurion trapped in the dream by providing him with the morrowgrain he needs to do so
---
I feel you, I can't play daily either, but BC dailies were a far cry from WoD/Legion/BfA dailies where you're actually falling behind if you don't do them literally every single day.  Same shit with flying, its literally only for level capped players, and only in Outland, big deal.  A giant chunk of the game for a large number of players is literally leveling, so only ground mounts in Azeroth which is still the majority of your leveling experience.
---
BC, you hit exalted with a faction you care about being exalted with, and the only thing you're "losing" is gold, which can be farmed in other ways on days you can play, unlike artifact power dailies where you can literally never get that artifact power back if you miss a day, you're permanently behind players who are able to grind every single day no matter how many catch up mechanics get added into the game.
---
Right click the window, choose to unlock frame and move it to your heart's content. Then relock it the same way.
---
Yes that’s a good goal to have, but that’s also 7 levels after 30 and has like a 15% drop rate. 
---
I’m just sharing something that’s quick, guaranteed, and useable right at level 30.
---
Tbh all leveling sucks haha.  The design was fucking brilliant for a first time playthrough but once you've done it a bunch each level range has its own problems.  1-10 you have no abilities or gear.  11-20 you can die very easily on certain classes and you don't have many tools.  23-30 you're stuck in 1 or 2 zones.  31-50 is slow and you're limited pretty much to stv and a bit of grinding elsewhere.  51-60 is a slog
---
F in the chat for Drejan
---
Lol are you 62?
---
At level 30 you can get a very strong axe from a warrior class quest but you'll need help from others to complete it at that level (final boss is lvl 40ish). If you can get a higher level friend to help you or even pay a stranger, it's definitely worth it.
---
Its on the TukUi website. Thats how I got it/updated it, at least.

The mage robe is close but Cthun robe has More crit in way of int and and resistance reduction.

Priest and Warlock can do it completely naked so hopefully not too much more than that for Druid.

Lame.

But I’m a warlock.

Turtles in the hinterlands

I've gotten to twinks swords from leveling so far. Got em resting in my bank till the twink apocalypse happens.
---
Also, your rational world would require prices to never fluctuate and things to always be available.
---
I hate when they do that. Like let me get the most out of my cool-down damnit
---
Believe it isn't happening until phase 2 or 3
---
It’s not on twitch they have their own client.
---
I remember a time where we only had the paragraph on back the box. Then we were able to read a page in a magazine. Now we have google, YouTube, Twitch, etc with plenty of answers to all the questions but people never want to jump in blind. They want all the answers before even considering a game.
---
&gt; trying to save durability by Hellfire
---
can you explain this?
---
Should've done this on Paladin toon, since this would be a legitimate leveling strategy.

i personally think that kodos are the ugliest mounts.  they look like big walking turds
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12549/braincage
---
This apparently, *nice*
---
Honestly bm is the easiest spec to play in pvp. You will prolly struggle more with MM. 
---
I would venture to guess you are not leveling up bite or claw. You have to actually tame new pets to learn the higher ranks. Are you learning your pet abilities from the pet trainer? Are you teaching these to your pet through beast training in your spell book? Simply learning the spells from the trainer isn't enough. Your pet has skill points it has to spend.
---
In my experience BM pets wreck most classes.  I leveled to 60 no problem as BM and only struggled with players high level than me. 
---
Anyway, I would be happy to assist further. I just require more information!

What mixed responses are you seeing? Everyone here is telling you that you can have 2 wow accounts on the same bnet.

And if you still have doubts, open a ticket and ask Blizzard directly, no better way to know for sure.
---
I’ll often turn my succubus lash attack off.  In that instance I do have a keybind to use her attack in the case I’m not Dark Pctibg her mana as much as expected. Even with it off, her auto attacks are still almost twice as powerful as my felhunters. The only time I’ll pull the Felhunter out is if I’m in a zone where the mobs are majority caster, or there’s a lot of alliance casters in the area.
---
Lmao true though, if you’ve played RS, the classic WoW grind really doesn’t seem too bad.
---
Care te explain?

Wheres the Master-er?!

its called either move anything  or move everything

i have it running just fine
---
the options do have a bunch of non classic stuff so i think its one of those few addons that just work regardless of what client you install it to, but maybe look if you can find a classic version first
---
You're sad that Taurens no longer have to wait 10 seconds of running to let mount speed kick in, and if they stopped moving it would return to normal and you'd have to run for 10 more seconds? also completely cancelled on damage? it's hecking awful my dude lol, thematically on point, though
---
Wtf did others roll, druid only weapon that all druids need.
---
Ive taken to sharing Healing Taken from my damage meter after the dungeon is done after ive played with people like that. Healer passive agressiveness at its peak.
---
Check out Neatplates.  Lots of config, but it can highlight mobs that have you targetted and different highlights if they have someone else.
---
Nicely done
---
Voidwalker was great up until around 35 then my dots alone would pull agro instantly off him even when I was spec into it. I use succubus atm and do fine.
---
Oh shit a recent 2400 player, let me kneel before you almighty warrior. All I am saying is dont fucking shame people for clicking some of their moves if they are doing fine. People act like you have to be absolutely flawless and if they are just an average player they make fun of them. I never said I was the best player all I'm saying is people shouldn't be talking shit to OP and assume they are a bad player because you see a screenshot with half their bar showing.
---
Gratz.
---
Interestingly, yesterday for the first time I finally someone else on the Black Stallion. It seems to be really rare just because it's not sold by the horse breeder next to the trainer.
---
It wouldn't reduce interaction, because it's not an interaction that already takes place. I've played since vanilla and I've never heard or seen anyone taking out a bounty on someone (not saying it never happens, just saying it's not common).
---
Has anyone in this family seen a chicken before?
---
Well it's not now, STEVE!
---
Threat plates! Its great
---
Because right now we have a blank slate to make a great game. The current devs are passionate and as you may have seen are willing to listen to the community. Going down the path of expansions lead to failure and people quitting. Why repeat history when you can learn from the mistakes and make something greater.
---
So my membership just ended. Ive known that it would end soon but lost track while enjoying this glorious game. It gave me a notification in game that my membership would end in 30 mins. I was running SM and didn’t want to leave my mates and I thought we could finish in time. Here’s my issue. I was planning on buying a token in retail since I have enough gold. Well now Im locked out of my account because i have no irl money budgeted for another month subscription. Is there anyway to get into my account and buy a token without having to buy a whole month sub?
---
There is an area in the Hinterlands that have the old high elf model npcs, they use some of the night elf building aesthetic to house them.
---
I'm confused about what summoning food/water has to do with alchemy? Alchemy is used to make flasks/potions and also used to transmute. It can be a very profitable profession. You can either sells flasks/potions that are desired for raids, or just utilize your daily transmute cooldowns for yourself or charge others to use them.
---
There is no issue with waiting to lvl your serious professions until max level, but if you are going to go that route I would suggest just picking up skinning for while you level. Since you will be killing things anyways, skinning will just add to the loot you can sell. Then you can drop it and level the professions you want later.
---
As for secondary professions First Aid is more or less required for many classes that do not have another way of healing themselves in combat. i.e. warr/rogue/hunter. Fishing and Cooking are more side money makers/savers as you can sell your fish or buff food or make buff food for yourself rather than sinking money into it.
---
How long does SFK take to run? And if I wanna find a group quickly, does it make the most sense to go to Undercity? Thanks!

It is also bannable if you are using this person to get past the inability to have a horde and alliance character.
---
I tried that and it was bugging out for me :(
---
I always seen the whole continent as a sea horse.
---
I understood probably what could happen - I used second tier of cure, which wont cure 100%, and have a chance to fail. Looks like i used it and it failed,so i thought this desease isnt cureable. :O
---
You get plenty of heavy leather in the 30s.
---
They coulda just replaced them with tokens like they did in BC as well so you could get the same armor with a different spec. I still liked that idea.
---
Yes you should be doing this, as well as with battle shout if party members are in range ofc
---
Or “Partner”!

This is how you tell if someone is big dick dps.

I put a /target name and then a cast shock spell and bind it to my scroll up. On my mouse I can unlock the scroll up and flick it to call the macro as many times as I like with one flick of my finger

I never once thought this guy's name was a pun, but rather a reference to this guy (which I still assume it is):   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuen_Woo-ping
---
**Yuen Woo-ping**
---
Yuen Woo-ping (Chinese: 袁和平; pinyin: Yuán Hépíng; alias: Yuen Wo-ping; born 1945) is a Hong Kong martial arts choreographer and film director, renowned as one of the most successful and influential figures in the world of Hong Kong action cinema. He is one of the inductees on the Avenue of Stars in Hong Kong. Yuen is also a son of Yuen Siu-tien, a renowned martial arts film actor.
---
Its the whole reason totem twisting is a thing
---
Use it to stop rogues from stealthing; there really isn't much of a justification to spend the rage on it outside of that.
---
From 1-36 every opener
---
Mining is difficult to quest and level at the same time. You'll almost certainly have to manually grind it to keep up with your leveling zones.
---
Nope, only to mobs (or falling I think)
---
  PvP doesn't and for whatever reason I think lifetapping to death counts as PvP.
---
Yeah I’d try both and see what you like. Retail has become a version of the game we’re gear for the most part is handed out and it is designed to keep even the most casual person somewhat competitive. On retail I play horde on tichondrius and it’s super toxic compared to alliance on kromcrush on classic. But classic will definitely eat up much more of your time than retail.
---
Retail players don't want to wait
---
https://imgflip.com/i/3bg6c6  someone did it.
---
Rend does not scale, you should be keeping it up 100% of the time before you get whirlwind at 36.
---
This is exactly it.
---
Because of his status as the Earth Warder he was closely attuned to Azeroth itself and was thus especially susceptible to the whisperings and temptations of the Old Gods.
---
In the process of making the Demon Soul he tainted his entire bloodline and later on worked to ensure that all his children were slaves to the old gods like himself
---
Nefarion and Onyxia are victims of the old gods and depending on when they were born they might not have enough independence from them to be personally culpable for their actions as they might have been completely under the old gods' sway even before they hatched.
---
If you never life tap as a warlock you suck. If you’re life tapping and not drinking when the healer drinks, you suck
---
 But after 36, not worth it?
---
Gather the mobs up and LoS or group them together somehow, get away when they freeze, and then taunt/interrupt casters so they don't screw up the mages. That's about all you van do aside from taunting or stunning the occasional mob that gets closest to the mage on nova rotation.
---
I wouldn't ask.  It then puts them in a spot where they may feel like they can't say no without looking like a jerk.  There are better options for you and you will replace off spec gear ASAP so just pass.
---
gnomergon
---
That’s what I’m feeling like.
---
You roll for your in-dungeon spec, unless you state otherwise prior to starting the dungeon and the group is ok with it. 
---
E.g. the druid should not have rolled on the feral gear here imo.
---
Paid a warlock 20g to run me through this... 17 runs later... still haven't seen it drop one time. He says I'm cursed. Good news is he didn't make me pay him.
---
I'm still sad though.
---
Correct after 36 it is useless in PVE
---
If I see that crap happen I'm telling everyone to need.  He's still only having at most a 50 percent chance of getting that loot and hopefully only a 25 percent chance of getting that loot.  Granted I don't think I'd mind replacing a dps way before that point.
---
That would be nice, so would a setting where it remembers whether or not you display that helm/cloak. I have a few helms I like to display and a few I don't. (i.e. Tier 2 and the red hat from Strat I like to show, but I don't like to show Crown of the Penitent)
---
There wasn’t a launcher in classic (or even the ability to to see your remaining game time period!)
---
Different approaches to the RPG that share an engine. Retail is much closer to an ARPG, like Diablo.
---
Well, im not going to go around, going around with you. So ha!
---
This is why in vanilla it was commonplace to need all boes unless grouped entirely with people you know. If someone really wants to equip it that can be discussed. Otherwise the ninjas win.
---
Mana regens very slowly there's very few scenarios where you could regen to full on a mount trip, so even if he's technically regening while mounted he's still short that mana when he dismounts and for those trips where he will regen to full it prevents him from burning all his mana before mounting.
---
Both scenarios result in xp/gold/whatever loss.
---
Half an hour with a good group. Sepulcher in Silverpine is closest.
---
Grats dude!
---
I want to imagine my group was just making it more exciting for me, they were hilarious and a lot of fun otherwise...
---
But I know in reality everyone's eyes rolled back into their head and their pupil's were replaced with dollar signs when it popped up.
---
 So your rational is sooner is important, but if your rational is the 1g 50s is more important then you know that's sort of the deciding factor.  I can't believe someone talking about rationality can't even rationalise people's deciding factors. Anyway  laataaa .

It's awesome, and also astronomically lucky.
---
&gt; they already announced the keyring will be in phase 2
---
Where? Last I heard, it was going to be a patch with no timeframe for when it will be released.
---
I mean I guess if you’re into maximum leveling efficiency, but I prefer to take breaks from questing/dungeons by training, leveling professions, and playing be AH a bit. I guess it just comes down to personal preference. For me I don’t consider it a waste of time because if I don’t feel like leveling hard, I’ll either do that or just log out
---
Normally, I'd get onto ya for not sharing a port that's already been cast, but the story was entertaining.
---
Dance, monkey, dance!
---
I need some tips on tanking the later dungeon like BRD and other dungeons higher up from it. I'm struggling with these huge packs of mobs one after another with people getting aggro, and me having to chase them. All the while I'm low on rage, struggling to keep things in control. I've tried to mark them too but I can't tell if some of the dps are cleaving/multidotting too quickly.   
---
Am I still suppose to be Demo Shouting on pull and just tossing out Sunders/Revenge? Is Thunderclap even good for threat? I'm still keeping a Fury talent build atm.
---
2 things. 
---
1: Don't be afraid to kick bad players. They won't learn otherwise. 
---
2: Make your own fucking groups you lazy fuckers, that way you can control who is in it instead of coming on reddit to complain that you joined someone elses group and didn't like the way they did things. 
---
You can replace dps within 30 seconds in any dungeon over level 40 right now, there is literally no reason to put up with the bullshit.
---
Try raising a ticket. I was once given 72 hours of gametime so I could log in and buy a token.
---
In a good way lol what's the add-on showing the resources on the minimap?
---
I've been meaning to but I forget about it every time I'm near an auction house.
---
Of course, they want people to pay them the monies.
---
I'm not exactly sure what the big deal is. Warlocks are comfortable at like 70%+ health. Just slap a renew on us and we'll be best friends. We have drain life to get us back up, where I'll sometimes lifetap and life drain at the end of a trash fight just to have some more mana.
---
WC sucks balls ball SFK is awesome, really doesn't take that long. Never had any problem getting groups really either.
---
THE BLES...SING
---
No the reason you kited Drakk (mage could do it also) until his two adds were down is because all three are immune to CC and hit hard enough that they cannot be ignored or tanked for any considerable time by anything but a plate wearer or druid. At least for pre raid characters.
---
Honestly, the more I think about it the more I think the actual changes came from high up. Im picturing something like this
---
Team: "ok, we will keep crap like melee leeway and spell batching, because we want a 100% faithful recreation of classic"
---
Management: "keep right click reporting from the legion client, though. And loot trading will save on gm tickets. Oh, and add layering, because we jave no faith in people continuing to play. 
---
Team: "we just added in the dumbest shit ever, because we were going for no changes. No we all look like assholes."
---
That is my theory at least behind the "some changes" mentallity they seen to have
---
#sowhite
---
The servers are jam-packed full.
---
But Arathi and Badlands should be good.
---
I agree. This sounds like a native speaker of one of the Asian languages, who first learned British English. 
---
In that context, Normaligan is a very phonetic spelling. Norm = Gnome, and l = r. Throw in the fact that vowels are hard, and it makes sense.
---
That's actually right about when it starts to finally not suck.  I've mailed feral since shortly after release and I'd forgotten how bad it is to start.  If you don't allocate your talent points in the right order, it's brutal till like...40.  once you have feline swiftness, furor and feral charge it gets smooth, then at thirty you pick up a ton of fun cat abilities.  I've never understood why rip is the first opener you learn and not FB.
---
I'd say it cost him his dignity but, he plays Gnome thus didn't have any to begin with.
---
This has nothing to do with spell batching.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294460/keyring-coming-to-wow-classic-in-first-patch-after-launch
---
Ya man. 35 gnome mage here. Any contested territory is a fucking slaughter. I thought I'd try PVP servers this time around and it takes a little getting used to.
---
Although its faster if u rotate with rested xp aka 1,5 lvls of rested every 8 days with 8 charaters its quiet nice.
---
&gt; Just because its classic doesnt mean you have to move at a snails pace
---
It does, tank set the pace feel free to leave the group.
---
The general consensus seems to be that I'm wrong, which is legitimate and does have some support in that classic actually was released. My one defense against the "that's what they said about classic" is that re-releasing something is a very different process than making all-new content. 
---
I hope you all are right, though, and they keep making new content instead of just going through the other expansions.
---
So which one do you want?
---
Y E S
---
Having a core group is so different than a PUG though. Don’t get me wrong, I hear your point, but when I don’t know most of my party up until the first couple bosses ‘safety first’ is absolutely my rule- especially because people are quick to blame the tank if a pull gets fucked up. Slow and steady for me until I’m sure that the party is capable.
---
If you have a party whose you trust that knows what they’re doing though, go nuts.
---
I had a gnome mage named Needmana that I killed in the badlands a few days ago. I'm finishing up some STV quests and he shows up in the corner of my screen as I'm at about 20% health and pulls out his wand. I think for sure I am dead. 
---
He targets the mob I am fighting!
---
I thank him, I wait around.
---
I help him kill and loot the named mob he is no doubt there for. 
---
I then kill him once again.
---
You are a good gnome, Needmana, but still a gnome. Maybe this time you won't forget who I am.
---
Ok,  not a cannibal but that sounds like a sound recipe for any "other"meat.
---
What cannon said. I would recommend at the least get a gathering profession or dual gathering profession to sell or store mats until you decide. Alch can be great even as a mage for the flasks and pots, but eng and mining can be good too if your going for solid pvp. I always picked fishing and cooking it always seemed a lot easier to level as you have he meat and fish on hand to level the cooking as your leveling.
---
Or, you know, people who only get to play for 2 or 3 hours a night.
---
Yea I would think at lvl 60 dungeons people would rather have good karma rather then an extra few gold... especially a mage..
---
Blutso going on many ignore lists.
---
See, that's what you're not getting, learning the recipe costs you 1.5g no matter if you buy it or loot it in a dungeon.
---
Seriously, I bring my own water and cook my own food, no need to fucking heal me too
---
Don't think that is something that an addom is capable of
---
It got filtered for a single zone, notice only one zone displayed
---
My anecdote - 
---
Hadn't played since WotLK, went and played retail for a few weeks after BfA came out. Got bored at level 47. I had three folks on my friends list. No one interacted on the "guild" I was in and the lvl 60's only showed up to raid once a week.
---
I have been playing classic for two weeks now, barely made it to level 35, have at least 20 names on my friends list, run dungeons and quest with guildies all the time and have no plans of backing out any time soon. 
---
They are two very different games. If you want to hurry up and do end game raiding, or pop in every now and then, run a dungeon silently and log off, retail will work for you. Oh and if you want pokemon pet battles. Retail has that now.
---
Takes about an hour to two hours. Join the channels World and LookingForGroup to find groups, you can also spam trade chat in any capitol. Other than those two channels, it's best to look for group in the zone the dungeon is in, so you'll want to recruit in Silverpine Forest general chat.
---
Well tanks and healers don’t have to join them, ever think about that? Pretty ignorant to think only tanks and healers can form groups
---
Stop useing rend when you hit 40. Charge MS/WW zerk/bloodlust are the only skills to use while leveling. Don’t execute unless close to death.
---
With good reason. That thing is money :D
---
I got my belt over a week ago, with not a single one having been posted on the AH yet at the time, so I'm super happy I don't have to wait for p3 for a decent belt or shell out an enormous sum of gold :))
---
*Derude sandstorm starts playing in the distance*
---
THEY CANT KILL ALL OF HIS WIVES IF WE RUSH EM!
---
Wow ive been healing since tbc and this doesnt bother me at all... maybe if im going oom every pull but so far i havent had that issue
---
Taking it slow in a pug is very much a good thing though, because there’s little if any coordination. Even trying to set up coordination doesn’t always work because people don’t listen sometimes.
---
Laughs in alliance
---
I agree with all of this.
---
Vendors are happy enough to buy it. It's not a huge moneymaker but I figure it pitched in 25g by 40.
---
Epic amounts of confirmation bias here.
---
Sadly I’m poor. Can afford my wow sub but not much more

People complained about it so they did it.
---
So today we wiped a few times at ony because people still had aggro after p2. so i guess onyxia is buggy at the moment.. other guilds also reported this bug.. Server:lucifron eu

FILLED WITH ROUGES
---
I spent 9 gold buying 3 runecloth bags and still hit 90g by 40. Just spend some time auction house flipping/leveling a profession whenever you’re in a city.
---
That’s the only time you can execute, though...
---
Mail, profession ui can be toggled by dressing a Burton in the top right i belive, if u only want the auction house part.
---
Hmm.. strange, will have to look at the attack speed and compare the data, as without lash my Fel seems to be the white dmg winner and can take more off tank dmg.               
---
         
---
Instance wise i tend to stay imp for the buffs and FS if there is no druid.
---
You'll probably be back before AQ
---
Question..
---
Are items that give you "healing and damage spells are increased by X" typically better than stat boosts?
---
I recently got some new gear, which had significantly lower stat boosts, but gave me some extra healing/damage. Is it typically worth more than stat boosts?
---
I just don't know what's better. Having 10 extra spirit or plus 10 to all my damage and healing.
---
Tirion and taelen just happen to be huge in that quest chain for whatever reason.
---
Tirion is reasonably larger, for a big dude. Taelen on the other hand is absolutely fucking massive.
---
No.  The role you come to the instance with is need roll.  You greed roll for gear that doesn't suit your current role ESPECIALLY if the set is literally designed for a different class and said class is present and wants it.  
---
If no one else can use it then ask to need roll.  They most certainly did not both have valid claims and its pretty messed up the rogue had to pay a druid to not roll on his class set.
---
Who cares what other people use
---
&gt; So I just started desolace and the magram were already red and gelkis were yellow
---
This is weird, because if you just started desolace both magram and gelkis should be yellow, and 2 quests should be available to you to choose one or the other.
---
Then you start killing one, get rep for that and negative rep for the other, until the one you chose becomes green and the other red.
---
You won't see the factions on your reputation list until you start the quest and kill one faction.
---
*Are you sure you're killing the right centaurs?*
---
Because there's a third village of them that has nothing to do with the 2 factions, they are red and you have a quest to kill them for charms or something like that.
---
Killing those instead of magram would explain what's happening to you.
---
What does VC means?
---
A tick timer for spell batching. I want to know when the current spell batch is ending and when the next spell batch is starting. Would be a must have for anyone into pvp or top dps
---
Resistance is based on your "elemental" skill, which is basically just your level. It's pretty standard to have rank 1 earth shock for interrupts and max rank for damage on your hot bars at the same time.
---
When you hit it a second time while chain is on cd it casts lightning bolt right?  It's working as intended if so and it should.  You can not get both to cast with one press of the key.  As soon as chain lightning goes it starts a global cooldown, that ends the macro right there.  If you push it again cl is on cd so it won't cause a global and then it will cast lightning bolt then end of macro.
---
Is Kargath a shorter ride than Thorium point? I never really asked why we grouped there. Or is it just because it has an inn?
---
That was never how vanilla worked, there was plenty of ganking. I'm simply pointing out that people who behave like that aren't doing themselves any favours. 
---
They'll make everyones lives miserable, scream "IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT LEAVE".. and then be confused that everyone has left.
---
But no, I won't be one of them. I'm not crying about PvP, I'm simply having the discussion.
---
gamergirl
---
tldr: do geen quests. period.
---
also, hit cap is 6% for yellow attacks if you are orc/human or have edgies. more than that doesn't matter as you will be losing better stats to get it.
---
LORE MONKEY, HEED YOUR MASTER'S CALL!
---
Why is Stratholme *still* on fire?
---
their basic rotation is rarely more than 1, 2, 3 3 3 3 3 repeat.  Any class can solo mindlessly like that for questing.
---
Where it gets interesting is chainpulling, hunter and lock then become fun and engaging.
---
Yeah PW Shield is usually better in the middle of a fight, once the tank has established aggro. I partially rely on the first few hits I take to generate the rage I need to use abilities.
---
Phase 2 most likely after blizzcon. so at least 3+months for each phase
---
After last phase we do nothing. gear alts.
---
The real secret fishing club is in Shatterspear Vale.
---
You realize they use nova, CoC, blizzard, and even flamestrike right?
---
Throw in a poly and CS for stragglers or caster mobs as well. AoE groups use a lot of abilities, much more so than the traditional frostbolt mage single target rotation.

What is tier 2?
---
Getting 5, 99s when OSRS came out again, is nothing compared to getting to level 60. I grew up playing different MMOs than WoW (couldn't afford the sub) and in most games at the higher levels 10%/hr was considered good.
---
No one is going to convince you to keep playing
---
Are you talking about the island you have to go to for the AQ sceptre chain quest?
---
And it took the whole first post at the top to prove what a chump, sorry, mighty Dwarven Warrior you are. Pfft, try not to choke on your neck rolls tonight. Done with your fat ass.
---
I could be wrong but my Felhunter always seems to underimpress on the damage, and whenever I do a rough comparison of their autos (I haven’t factored attack speed) the succubus seems to hit a lot harder.
---
Yea sorry i shouldve hovered over it in the screenshot lol
---
How can I mod my game to replace my characters grunts Michael's screams?
---
Google it.
---
Sounds like you suck at the game. Either get better or just go do something you enjoy instead.
---
Unfortunately as soon as you start putting restrictions of any kind in you lose what makes PvP servers special. If a decent group of each faction can make it to 60 and enjoy PvP, the mass ganking will calm down a lot.
---
The problem right now is there's so few high levels to come and help.
---
Killing yourself with mother hellfire doesn’t cause durability loss thus no repair bill. So if you a know a wipe is coming hellfire yourself to death.
---
We don’t know, but the conversation will likely start around AQ time if I had to guess, as that’s when a lot of raiders seem to die out. I think the conversation will be best when everyone has a good idea of what Classic WoW is and what we actually want moving forward. Most likely? BC is next. Classic WoW + is possible but I see that more of down the line many years.
---
Either way the Classic chain of projects will likely be whatever the community is screaming for as that’s what Classic WoW has started as in the first place, and Blizzard has said multiple times that it’s about what the community wants.
---
From blizzard:
---
“Melee leeway” is working as intended. After careful study and testing, we’ve found that for players with low latency, the state of melee leeway is how they would have experienced the game in 2006.
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887/23
---
It works exactly the same as in vanilla.
---
Where do you get that idea? I never die in this shit, it's just killing boring ass mobs all day and doing boring ass quests that are the exact same.
---
HOW LONG TIL THE END ARE WE THERE YET
---
The succubus is absolute trash if you're caught by horde as alliance. I found myself swapping my succubus for a voidwalker often when I'm in heavily contested zones like STV and Tanaris
---
You got that backwards. 
---
Getting level 60 is nothing - getting 5 99s is a lot longer
---
Hardcore disagree. 
---
I'm mainly affliction and a bit destruction and I've consistently been near the top of DPS in dungeons I'm doing. You're just running into stupid Locks who think they need to have all their dots and SL rolling at once.
---
&gt; the dancing troll village 
---
One of my goals in classic is to get an alt back into Shatterspear Vale.
---
You definitely can solo the level 33 trolls at 30, you just have to eat/bandage in between every single one. That's how I did it on my warrior.
---
First time seeing a warlock on a steed: *dude, your pony is on fire*
---
Imagine his face once he gets there.
---
Experience.  
---
In d2 I botted my ass off before I realized it was pointless and ruining the game for me. 
---
Exact positioning with same characters...yeah, and others comments.  It’s botting.
---
Sounds like PVE server syndrome
---
It is not the same game. Much like Runescape 3 and Old School Runescape are both iteration of the same game but manage to be something very different due to design philosophy.
---
I guess what I'm saying is liking classic doesn't mean you'll like retail. If it's just the subscription to play I'd say go for it. Not sure I'd suggest you pay for expansions, I don't really understand how retail monetizes.
---
Try your realm’s discord server. Ours has a bounty board where people can post bounties. If yours doesn’t you could suggest it.
---
"A miser knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing."
---
Yeah. I have the link somewhere. Bump me in 3 hours if you can't find the link and I'll give it to you  after work
---
If they meant "phase 2" they would have said that, not "first patch".
---
We can revive her. The spell to do so is locked in the Vatican.
---
Yup. It was rare to run the whole instance.
---
&gt;while they were lifetapping and eating after every pull. 
---
wtf, just drain tank.
---
Wait what, loot trading?
---
&gt;It's taking me days to gain a single level now 
---
I think it’s not ur game :) just move on if it doesn’t give u joy
---
This is most likely a person whose first language is not English.
---
True dat, edited. Thank you. :) I need you as a personal proofreader that was a timely response! Haha.
---
If that's not what the bug fixed, then what did it fix?
---
Unless you are close to death. Executing dumps all rage, it’s better to pool rage get an extra AA then intecept / charge next target with a 50rage bar
---
You set keybinds to both bartender 4 and then matching ones in the g13 setup.  
---
Hit the g13 button and the bartender corresponding one works- pretty damn simple.
---
Is there a dungeon finder addon yet? I've been having a hard time finding groups as a DPS.
---
You should be able to go to the character select screen in BfA and it should prompt a gold purchase for subscription button if you have enough gold on the realm.
---
Jokes on you I turned off the sound
---
Unless the first patch after the launch happens to be phase 2, of course.
---
Mage water doesn't take hours to level up though. I do agree that it's lame to assume the chest is yours but it's definitely more a bitch to level lockpicking and be able to open that chests then buying a mage spell from your trainer. Also, every mage I've done dungeons with charge for city port at the end of a group, which I feel is no different than the rogue taking the chest. Both douchebags
---
If you don't like it, you don't like it.  If you think the dungeons and quests suck, that's pretty much all the game is outside of raiding and much later on, battlegrounds.  
---
Sounds like this isn't the game for you!
---
Kbaiii
---
Nobody warned him.
---
I quickly read it and was like huh.... 
---
The amount of clicking and time for 2 99s - or even 1 99 - is more than level 60
---
I’ve been trying to make this work. Even made an orc. How?
---
This checks out. Burned out on my rogue at 42 and rerolled priest. Getting adrenaline rush just didn't keep me entertained enough. Haven't looked back yet, albeit I'm only 37. At least I have shadowform to look forward to.
---
I'm just pissed I bought my mount on my rogue when I'm probably not going to main him now.
---
We have this in the real world. 
---
Pandas.
---
how do people make these clips do you all casually record all the time or do you hit record when you know something interesting might happen
---
You think you would, but you wont!
---
Personally, I'm all for them dropping the current faction split, be it total unification, or something more akin to what the Pandas choose, but with say... Light vs Void. Or something. In retail the current split doesn't work so well. It reminds me a lot of Ross &amp; Rachel's relationship from Friends... war, peace, war, peace, war, peace, war... 
---
Though I'm also in favour of having all classes available to all races.
---
This is all for retail, I should add.
---
maybe you're just burnt out, take a little break
---
Take it at whatever pace you feel like.
---
You can go like 3 weeks before you max out rested XP, it's fine.
---
But the best thing about this game is that you're just about into the pre-endgame content. When you hit 45+ there's a real chance of getting items that'll be relevant for you into endgame and you're not just grinding for levels anymore.
---
You can start picking up attunement quest chains and stuff and there's a lot of two birds, one stone stuff that you can do as you approach and go through your 50's.
---
The reality is, leveling slows down substantially 40+.   
---
The trick with leveling is that the natural bread crumb quest progression does a poor job ensuring you as a player have adequate quests to keep you going as you level. I'd suggest grabbing a quest helper/leveling addon as they will help rotate you through zones to keep your leveling process focused more on quests and less on purely grinding mobs.  
---
That said, I'd expect it to take the average person 8-10 days ./played to hit 60. That is assuming you spend the majority of your time leveling and not getting side tracked exploring.  
---
So, figure out how much you play per day and you can figure out how long that should take. If you play 3 hours a day, that would be 2-3 months of real life time to hit 60 with 8-10 days ./played. It isn't a fast process and the people hitting 60 quickly are doing so because they are spending 6+ hours a day on average playing WoW.
---
&gt;I missing something or is this really how the famed vanilla wow is?
---
People like runescape too. Not every game is for every person. If grinding isn't something you find tolerable or satisfying, dip out until phase 3 when battlegrounds open and there's more for you in the endgame.
---
But yes, many games from vanilla's day were as grindy or grindier. And people liked them.
---
I don't play that much jackass.
---
Before the new patch on retail I would agree with you but if you've seen the shit show they've done with the story they're better off making classic +
---
Of the current content stuff, they are pretty similar to each other in time spent. You grind dungeons for chances at loot and do your raids, farm mats, stuff like that.
---
Classic content *usually* takes longer to run (travel time, dungeons tend to be slower, etc) while retail tends to come in quicker, higher intensity bursts.
---
That said, if you care for tmog, lore, mounts, reps, etc. then retail has WAY more content than classic, as they have 7 expansions worth to sort through.
---
I specifically said "caught by horde as alliance" meaning they have will of the forsaken. In that case sacrifice is nearly always better than the succubus
---
😻
---
I don't think there are any good bop leatherworking items.
---
The most gold would be from tribal leatherworking and being one of the first people to get [Pattern: Hide of the Wild] from dire maul when it launches.
---
Blizzard, I'm sure, is keeping an eye on sign ins and gear levels. Until people "finish" each phase, and start to stop logging in, there's no reason for them to release each phase.
---
Also, after phase 6, there's no expected or announced content. So there's no reason for them to rush. It's in blizzard's best interest to draw out each phase as long as possible.
---
feral cat : bottom 2 worst dps
---
Feral Bear: OK tank at best
---
Resto: worst healer but at least you can give people innervate.
---
I know the feel. Dropping last second Earth Shock on something, getting the notification from my add-on that it interupted, and still getting hit with the spell SUCKS.
---
"The pain! The agony! The... wait, I soul stoned myself. VICTORY IS MINoh crap I came back too close to the bears."
---
yeah but its about scaling your playstyle. Bad tank, sure. But you clear instances working together and thats at the level of the weakest team member.
---
And the Lv 1 warrior. :P
---
4. strategizing over shared resources, e. g. *You pick up the book first, it'll respawn in a couple of minutes and I'll grab it on the way out.* or *don't accept the Escort until everybody is ready!*
---
No one is disagreeing that it would be great if the classic community was amazing and had no bad people there.  But it's the internet and there is some level of anonymity in the game.  You have to be out of your mind if you think the community can be this amazing place where everyone gets along. 
---
 Need boes or lose your chance at them. Your choice lol
---
For all our bickering, we have a really good community here. There's a lot of help and encouragement to be found.
---
Where is Senpala?
---
We have no idea. 
---
I personally hope each phase is 4-6 months long. This will give us 2-3 years of classic content, which is similar to how long vanilla wow lasted before TBC. Personally, I want BGs earlier and other content to come out slower, but I understand the rationale for a more vanilla like release of content. With that said, for all we know they will release phases faster or slower.
---
As for what comes after phase 6, it is too early to really decide. How popular will Classic WoW be in 2 years. Will people get tired of it? Will it be a strong and vibrant community. I hope the latter is true, but who knows. And while blizzard has indicated they will make decisions based on what the community wants, it’s way to early to know what the community wants. Will we want new servers with TBC content? Will we want current classic servers to get TBC? Will we want no change where Classic stays as is forever? Will we want a Classic + experience with changes in line with Classic?
---
The latter costs money and won’t happen unless Classic is super popular. And while the community right now may have a consensus on what they want after Classic phase 6, what the active community wants in 2 years (or whenever phase 6 has been out for several months happens) is more important than what people who play now and quit on a few months want. 
---
The good news is uncertainty is normal. Do we know where a new game will end up on 2-3 years? Absolutely not. At least with Classic we know the medium term plan even if not the longterm plan.
---
This looks like a Paul Sr/Jr meme.
---
&gt;I’m wondering, after all of these roll out, what might happen next?
---
Three options.
---
A) Server wipes/rollout of fresh servers and it becomes a rolling reset. This model exists and has happy players in it for Everquest, as well as being how private servers handled it. I don't see public support for it and consider it the least likely.
---
B) Classic+, blizzard takes the end of classic as a start point to develop wow in a new direction from where retail ended up going. Many of the hardcore supporters of classic seem to fall into this camp. Although many of them enjoyed TBC/WotLK, it's often said that the game was clearly going downhill and heading towards Cataclysm from a design perspective.
---
C) Classic continues into TBC and WotLK. Cataclysm was considered a disastrous expansion and would almost certainly never get continued into. Many ex-retail players who were not super invested in classic so much as "not current wow" and the nostalgia enthusiasts fall into this camp. Blizzard has said technologically this is relatively easy.
---
~
---
In this subreddit you'll usually see the most support for Classic+, but I think realistically speaking even if Classic+ could be enjoyable for everyone playing currently it won't happen. TBC/WotLK were relatively well received and were often viewed as "the last good days" by many players. It's likely cheaper to keep copying the old expansions (Classic had a team of 17 devs, and is easily generating millions of revenue already) than it is to develop new content.
---
I very much hope they don't take the safe route, it would be the end of my interest in this sadly. I want the kind of MMO classic is, and there just aren't any new ones getting made these days.
---
Woosh
---
Are you 100% sure you were killing Magram? The Kolkar centaurs are right beside them and start out hostile and don't give rep.
---
False, I can hold agro off "big dick dps" so let's fucking go. I don't want a 7 hour brd run, I want it done in an hour. So pull out that elephant in your pants and let's go. Mobs die faster, I take less damage, healer needs less mana, less down time more phat loot.
---
is that like a mouse specific thingy or can you do that with every mouse?
---
was wondering why that idiot was making so much noise in STV
---
on the other end of the faction war we assumed it was "HELP HELP I'M BEING GANKED FUCK MY LIFE HELP ME PLEASE"
---
How?

Holy hell, thank you. I found it and it works!

---
Oh boy,  my favorite game.
---
I didn't say you did.
---
Yes but theres that delay, that lets you keep running at mount speed. Sometimes with bad latency or laggy servers you can get halfway up a zepplin tower before you dismount and lose that 60/100% movement
---
You talking about how your target's status updates slower than the raid frames?
---
Its worth more gold than 99% of the playerbase could possibly have yet.  :D
---
Anyone have a good addon recommendation for tracking my debuffs on targets?
---
Remember not to use heroic strike unless you have to. It replaces your weapon attacks so on top of costing rage to use, it lowers your rage generation. Sunder armor can be used to lower their armor and attempt to proc overpower but I wouldn't use that in a dungeon.
---
If you never do BGs and hate pvp then maybe your point stands but in all other occasions the free mount sucks.
---
&gt;lierally done MC and seen myself pulling the numbers I said I have, so I know I am correct
---
We have logs that show this to be 100% false and you have nothing, your anecdotal bullshit without any evidence is just that, bullshit.
---
It's like if I said I run 30mph often but offered absolutely no evidence and you showed how it was impossible with data from world record sprinters.
---
Your full of shit and make no effort to prove anything and want us to pretend like you didnt just spew complete and utter nonsense.

&gt;Both of us are going off of personal experience and hearsay,

No, I have literal data logs of exact evidence, you have nothing but shitspew.
---
Ahh, is this our daily thinly disguised Warrior circlejerk thread?
---
I was getting worried when I saw there were only 3 on the front page!
---
This is a long thread so this post will probably get lost but as a frost mage who AE killed duo pretty much all the way AE runs can actually be pretty amazing if people adjust their strategy.  We ran SM a bunch of times leveling and most of the pulls went like this.  
---
Tank and healer pull 3 - 5 packs of mobs and LoS them.  Mages pop frost shields and wait till the pack is coming round the corner.  The mages are at range and near each other.  Blizzard snare kiting ensues with the tank always going after the target closest to the mages, pulling it back into the pack or just stopping it.  Frost shield + bubble stop the mages losing blizzard ticks due to range attacks.  Mages slowly kite back, using nova to keep the pack together.  Clears were fast and clean and in all the pulls we only even had one wipe due to a lot of casters in a pull spiking down a mage.  
---
I'm not saying this is how instance runs need to be but one of the things I love about classic is that group comp can change how you play.  Don't get stuck in the mindset that everything has to always be done just one way.  Look at what classes you got and adjust how you play to maximize the potential you have.  
---
I'm always open to trying new ways to clear packs and play.  Only thing I dislike is grouping with people who don't know their class and are unwilling to learn it, thinking that they know it all.  Classic wow offers some of the most versatile play as classes are distinct and have a ton of tools at their disposal.
---
I find doing dungeons nets me a few gold after selling greens, Grey's, etc. Then again I'm not not a tank and therefore don't have to worry too much about repair bills..
---
You nailed it! I hear it in my sleep haha
---
But that makes no sense, if we go by that thought logic, couldn't you just enjoy finding it without winning it? Why does it matter if you win the roll or not?
---
Yep. It's too bad everything to do at level 60 outside of Onyxia is in Eastern kingdoms. Haven't been to org in days, too busy needing to be close to a flight path to blackrock mountain or epl, and had to set my hearth to kargath.
---
Hey man I just wanna ask you if you are playing solo or with a buddy? I have a similar experience when I am playing by myself but always have a great time and questing goes so much faster with a friend. We hang out in discord and kill alli on sight. Hope you find some joy!
---
Do they still sell expansions? That was more relevant to OP's question.
---
Lost a pair of +healing cloth pants to a mage, can confirm.
---
"It has more int than mine"
---
I think they mean balanced as in 2v2, 3v3, etc. Not balance as in between the classes, balance as in the same number of people fighting per side in arenas.
---
Oh shit. No Dune no Spice. GG
---
i can tell you didnt really PvP much in classic ever it would seem. this is so far from the truth. racials come in clutch in BGs all the time.
---
The last place I worked made drastic sweeping changes that affected the ability of all the techs to do their job and routinely never mentioned it to anyone until it was a full blown crisis affecting multiple customers/tickets/etc...

This became the go to response every time it happened, which was shockingly frequent.

What's the threshold? Is it known?

Week one was my favorite part. Tbh now it feels like retail.
---
Different strokes
---
go to any zone that has green lvl mobs and steamroll grind em. vendoring most stuff with yield u quite alot
---
I just did a /who for every level and I couldn't get the number of gnome mages or human warriors so I just put them at 50, and got 18% of online players as level 60. Considering a good number of lower level players are alts, I'd say "almost nobody is 60" is very far from the truth.
---
The irony of you calling me a troll made me almost fall out of my chair.

Oooooooo missingno Mount!!

It's not what I do for a living. Just adding another tool to the toolbox
---
This dude. This is the issue. Bitching is one thing - getting flamed because you're using area chat to try get players together to combat the other faction?
---
I would argue anyone who has an issue with that are the players that shouldn't be on a PVP server. Why not go PVE where you can turn it on or off as you please and do whatever you like? If you opt to play PvP then that's exactly what if is - PvP. If you're not one of the dudes being a twat in chat when someone asks for help then why are you triggered?

I heard a rumor that GM island was taken out, though if anyone can prove me wrong, please do. I've already seen photos that Hyjal is still the same as it was in Vanilla.

Ive tried the G600 and the razer naga epic, the G600 is huge so I’m not sure I’d recommend it and the razer is pretty good and mid sized but has the worst customer service if something goes wrong, I never tried the corsair one but the buttons are adjustable so you can make it fit better, the software is good on other corsair products and so is the customer service

That is the conundrum.

I let a warlock hellfire for dps yesterday, it made me sit down to drink as a holy paladin every few pulls and I really did not enjoy that experience. Tappin' is cool though

Im 40 at 6 days too but i swear like 30 hours has been me or my misso just moving the character to not get logged out
---
The point of the meme is flawed logic. I've seen this numerous times where an alliance has attacked a horde member in STV and about 6 horde ambushed the solo alliance trying to gank a lower level horde. It's quite funny to watch happen.
---
As a tank, I've discovered an ironic paradox, here.
---
If I get a group ***without*** impatient DPS, I can often chain pull six mobs one after the other, and survive.  If I get a group with impatient DPS, we will usually wipe when we try and do that.
---
The reason why is because impatient DPS generally aren't team players.  They don't want to use CC at all, they don't care about the mage or healer having full mana, and in general they don't care about anything at all, other than their own glory on the DPS meter.  So they are welcome to accuse me of being a bad tank, but they normally aren't interested in doing literally anything to ensure the ***group's*** success, as opposed to merely their own, either.
---
Sociopathic DPS will never be convinced that they are wrong, however.  Part of the definition of sociopathy, after all, is an immunity to emotional (and sometimes even rational) appeals.  The only solution to the problem is to play on low pop servers, and avoid peak times, because the busier a given server is, the more likely you are to encounter these people.
---
For alliances Orcs gank the most, then Taurens. Undead too, but at a lower ratio. Never seen a troll be a b\*tch tho

Are you guys using a hot spot from a cell phone or something on board from the boat? I’m unfamiliar with your line of work but I’m a truck driver working with a partner and have been looking at a similar set up for down times on the long drives!

Been trying this and I haven’t been able to consistently not pull the whole room.
---
Why???
---
What keyboard and mouse are you using? Mine always lose connection depending on how I'm sitting
---
I try to tell people this pretty often. WoW and all its expansions should be thought of as different games with the same root.
---
I tend to liken it to the Mario games. Vanilla is SMB1 while retail is like Mario Odyssey. Like retail, Mario odyssey is vastly different from SMB1 although it still shares similarities and you can tell it’s still holds a lot of the fundamentals of the original games. But you cannot fairly compare them to one another. Each Mario game (and each wow expansion) should be looked at on its own merits and demerits to be judged based on those.
---
In vanilla and TBC all serious pvp arms warriors went mace spec, swords or axes were only comparable if orc or human.
---
When I went arms, it was always swords or maces - swords were more fun but maces were undeniably superior.
---
For every fight ended by a double sword proc, you'd have so many ended by mace procs. Stuns greatly magnify a warrior's effectiveness.

Oh, that's because it was funny

Yeah i've tried playing with friends but they all quit before I did. And leveling with a friend is a pain in the ass. Your quests aren't tracked together, you get them messed up constantly, if someone plays a little more than you then you fall behind and can't play together. It's all a pain in the ass and it seems the game was not designed to be played like that.
---
Damn trolls.

Just check it, definitely not this one
---
Im pretty sure reddit was made for reading while pooping
---
Great, one down, MANY to go. 
---
These worst one for me personally is that casting feign death(as a dwarf and nelf atleast, havent tested horde races) will put both your melee and ranged autoattack on absurdly long cooldown, even longer than a fresh auto would take, and having a quick shots proc or rapid fire running doesnt seem to do anything at all to make this less painful.
---
So options are to not cast feign death and waste dps from kiting/being in melee, dont use cds or multishot ever, wasting even more dps, or dps as normal and feign and lose dps.
---
But the reagent is 18s (with rep) why say it's 30s?
---
A stun IS a free attack, silly
---
Well Naxx gear blows everything else out of the water so no.
---
Pvp gear is similar to AQ 40 gear, but I think AQ40 is better overall.
---
But there are some very good pvp pieces for some classes. But overall raid gear is easier to get, and to gear as fast as possible, you should do both.
---
Yeah - they're on it man! Kill a few and bang they counter with force. No reason we can't do the same to them. If more dudes realized it was a PvP server and ran over to help - we'd stomp. But it's the guys that do absolutely nothing and sit their telling people to stop crying about PvP that have it all wrong. It is a PvP server. So fucking PvP!

---
yup. hopefully dont get downvoted for not wiping the right way.
---
&gt; while they were lifetapping and eating after every pull.
---
You don't need to do that at all. Placing your dots + wanding is enough to kill same-level mobs. I only need to eat/drink after maybe 10 mobs if I pull 1on1.
---
Honestly I couldnt remember if it was 20s or 30s so I thought it's better to give the higher cost lol.

These are the reported changes for the level 80 onyxia.. they brought the boss again in wotlk and they changed some stuff

Bummer. Most alliance I cross have been friendly so I try to return the favor. We all gotta xp! Arathi has been the most brutal pvp wise for me so far though.
---
Here's the thing about pulling. I remember most of the time a hunter or mage pulled and we did just fine. The difference is everybody was on the same page. There was a kill order and marked cc targets.
---
You can have the tank pull all day long and that 10% or whatever isn't going to save you from people who don't pay attention or don't care what the plan is.

* There's a really cool guide to threat mechanics Elitest Jerks had up back in the day. If I can find it I'll post it.
---
* Tankspot.com used to have all the guides for all the boss fights. Its been a milennia since I was there last though.
---
* Icyveins.com has some classic builds posted. They'll even walk you through step by step, level by level. (Editor's note: I love these guides.) I'm not really into that while I'm leveling. I'll just build around what I've got or what I'm feeling at the moment. (True, I have altered their recommended path, but I still like them as general guidelines.)
---
**Stat Priority**
---
**Tank:** stam &gt; agi &gt; str  
---
**Dps:** str &gt; agi &gt; stam  
---
**Stam** = hp  
---
**Str** = block and 2 attack power per 1 str  
---
**Agi** = armor, dodge, and 1% crit per 20 agi  
---
**Hit cap:** dungeons 5% raids 9%  
---
**Dual Wield Hit Cap:** 24 %
---
**While Leveling**
---
Go arms till 30 at least. I enjoy arms all the time, but there are reasons. (Almost all builds, if not all, incorporate arms for rage generation and management.)
---
Prot takes too long to kill anything. You don't get zerker stance till 30 which is the fury stance. You don't get dual wield until 20. Which is one of the big fury builds.
---
You want to talent tactical mastery asap. Idgaf if you're soloing, tanking, dpsing, or even pvp, tactical mastery turns on stance dancing. And I promise if you warrior right you'll switch stances at least once a fight. Talent anywhere from 2 to 5 in tactical mastery. I talent 3 in tactical mastery because 15 rage turns on most of my abilities. 25 rage turns on everything but capstones like mortal strike and blood thirst. Whirlwind, for example, is 25 rage.
---
**Stance Dancing**
---
Why is stance dancing important? Abilities are locked to stances. All of the abilities I list below get used. All of them. If you say, 'but my role is x', 'or my spec is x', 'I don't use stance x', (then my response is) sorry bro, you're making life hard for no reason.
---
**Battle stance:** charge, thunderclap, overpower, rend, retaliation  
---
**Zerker stance:** whirlwind, zerker rage, recklessness  
---
**Defensive stance:** revenge, shield block, shield wall
---
**Rotation**
---
    1. Charge
---
    2. Sunder
---
    3. Def Stance
---
That's the most basic single target pull a warrior does. And it has a stance change in it. Tactical mastery turns this on.
---
    2. def stance
---
    3. sunder
---
(Basic macro right there, if a warrior who hasn't macro'd this already is reading this). Which makes a slight difference, however it also turns on your aoe pulls. 
---
    2. thunder clap
---
    3. zerker stance
---
    4. zerker rage
---
    5.blood rage
---
    6. whirlwind
---
    7. def stance
---
    8. sunder
---
    9. switch targets (tab)
---
    10. sunder
---
    11. tab
---
    12. sunder
---
    13. etc etc
---
Arms has this as an option for aoe too:
---
    2. sweeping strikes
---
    5. blood rage
---
    9. Switch Targets
---
    10. Sunder
---
    11. Switch Targets
---
Those are tanking aoe pulls. However, they're also pulls for 2+ mobs in solo questing, etc. Solo questing as a warrior can teach you a lot about rotations and abilities you can use, and you should definitely do it because theres a lot of stuff here that's not in retail. Don't get me wrong, there is no hard and fast answer that works every time. There is no one button warrior macro that's any good.
---
Without tactical mastery your rage hits 0 every stance change, so your auto attacks are just getting thrown away.
---
For solo questing though I'd probably do something more like :
---
    4. blood rage
---
    5. zerker rage
---
    7. cleave
---
    8. battle stance
---
    9. overpower
---
    10. throw rends around
---
    11. maybe some hamstrings depending on health, maybe some overpowers if I get a crit &gt; execute to finish
---
Honestly warriors change what they're doing based off what they're fighting. You don't rend something immune to bleeds. When you're fighting something with high attack speed like a cat or a raptor and are using a slow two hander as most builds go, keeping thunderclap up can save your life. It can also reduce downtime eating if the mob isn't orange to you.
---
**Eating**
---
Alright, food is expensive. You want to eat as little as possible so you can get mounts. Because I'll tell you what's not going to happen: no one is paying 100g for level 40 blues. Gtfo with that logic. Maybe, maybe for the .01 % drop purples. Really, you're gonna get your mount from smart choices and vendoring a bunch of whites and greens. Green plate might make a couple gold on AH. But you're gonna wanna equip that soooo, there's a way to do things that saves a ton of gold.
---
* If I pull one mob and it drops me to half health I know I can wait 5 sec and pull the next mob without eating. If the mobs are not right on top of each other I'll get that hp by the time I'm in charge range. If that's the case for what I'm fighting, I can fight 2 at once. No matter what I'm eating after I kill 2.
---
* If fighting one mob drops me 1/3 hp or less I can usually kill 5 before I eat if I single pull. Why? A bit of health regen when I travel to the mob, because sometimes I crit and sometimes I don't. Sometimes I'll crit a mortal strike and then they'll dodge my auto and I've got &gt; 50% chance to crit overpower, so I'll drop it like a brick. So that's 5 mobs without eating, and that happens consistently.
---
* If I pull 5 of those same mobs at once, I've got a corpse run or retaliation is getting used.
---
* If I pull 3 of those same mobs at a time, I have to eat. Why? Well, none of that regen while traveling to a mob. And heres the big one: missed procs. Sure I can thunderclap, sweeping strikes, whirlwind and cleave, but there's a cooldown on overpower. It's short, but that cd is long enough that if a proc happens at the start of the cd you won't be able to use it when the cd ends. Overpower is a free crit and a free deep wounds, why the hell would I give that up? It makes a huge difference.
---
Do single pulls, it'll change your life.
---
**Filler Abilities**
---
Alright, heroic strike, cleave and - lets face it - probably slam too. These are abilities you're not gonna use much. We call em rage dumps. A rage dump is an ability that you use to keep from sitting constantly at 100 rage. At low levels you'll probably use them a lot. As you level you'll have more important things to spend rage on.
---
A lot of people will say start cleaving or heroic striking at like 50 rage, which isn't bad advice. It's just a bit high. It's a good place to start of you're new to warrior though. I'd say heroic strike / cleave down to your tactical mastery amount +10. You don't want rage sitting in your pool not getting used. I say tactical mastery +10 because it's enough to hit shield bash, rend or intercept - and maybe pummel, I think thats 15 rage though - stance dance, and then use an ability that costs less than your tactical mastery immediately. Thats all you need in reserve.
---
The good thing about cleave and heroic strike is that they are not on the gcd (Global cool down).
---
**Sunder Armor**
---
Sunder armor is not the magical solution to all your problems. Don't get me wrong, it's great, it's my favorite ability in classic, but don't waste 5 sunders on something that's gonna die in 5 sec. For real, if you're solo and its at half health after 2 sunders, use damage abilities. 3 sunders is the most you'll probably use on a non elite.
---
I can't tell you how many warriors I've seen just stacking 5 sunders and auto attacking mobs to death complaining about eating after every mob. Sunder armor does no damage on the attack itself, it's just armor pen and a flat amount of threat. Honestly once you get to a certain point gear-wise it's more threat to do damage in defensive stance than to sunder.
---
And one more thing about sunder, it's on the gcd. So without haste it's 1.5 sec between sunders. It also costs 15 rage. At minimum if your group is waiting on 2 sunders, that's 3 sec for one mob. It is impossible to put 2 sunders on 3 mobs in 3 sec. Sunder is not an aoe. Make sure (the plan is) wait 3 sec then attack the one with 2 sunders, not the one 8 miles away I (the tank) haven't looked at yet.
---
**TLDR**
---
People sunder trash too much. Single pull when you can to save on food costs. Rotations and spec stuff up there. There's no way to shorten a guide. That's like asking for a tldr on the dictionary.

 Any Rogue who loses to a Warrior is doing it wrong.

Overpower is going to proc anyway. Eating one OP crit is a lot better than eating a MS, A WW an autoattack and an Overpower.

Personally I love seeing Warriors try that because the second they swap to Battle Stance they've given up their ability to break gouge/sap, so you get a free re-stealth and re-open on them.

PvP has basically no balance, PvE has basically no balance.
---
From a developers perspective vanilla is a piece of shit. (A piece of shit that we love)
---
What players do like is that the people who spends that insane amount of time in the game feels rewarded compared to retail. And people like to feel powerful once they get certain items.

This might not be the answer you are looking for but classic isn't for a lot of players.

The gold is far more valubal than what it provides. Really only good for running low lvl dungeons tbh. Sure it's nice for now but gets replaced very easily in p1 content.

If you dont plan to raid at all then sure use it but that gold can go a lot further in actual bis items for the entirety of vanilla.

But reported by whom?

Changing target resets the sequence.
---
Its because both classes have like no movement abilities. Until 40 as a lock, you are walking everywhere manually, no blink, sprint no ghost wolf, cheetah, etc. Same with paladin.
---
Locks and paladins are the most immobile classes in the game. I guess priests too, but they get shafted lol. At least they have leviate to run across water.

 Warriors have insane scaling on Spr, something like 80% of Spr as HP regen IIRC (mage is about 7%).

Don't go out of your way to stack it, sure. But don't ignore it.

Don't want to burst your bubble, but there's a really useful addon called Recipe Radar that I'm currently using in Classic.  It includes all vendor recipes across all tradeskills, including cooking.  It lets you either see all the recipes for sale in the current zone you're in, or lets you choose a profession and find where all the recipes are purchased, and includes a map of the zone with an icon showing exactly where the merchant is. (Useful for those hidden vendors way out in the middle of nowhere.)

Bubbling up, mounting, running through a huge pack of mobs and never getting dismounted because each mob only hits once
---
I agree with ya. I guess I didn’t word my response he best. There is never a lack of something to do in retail, but as in the bred and butter of gearing and leveling you’ll have much more seat time trying to get the gear or levels or gold needed for something compared to the retail version. I’ve also played every xpack and it just feels like as they progress the gear is easier and easier to get, and with raidfinder and group finder a quick dungeon is a lot easier to get into.

---
As a patient player, and a rogue, I'm all about what my tank and healer say. Also, when I'm prepping for dungeon runs I have the mindset of "this is may take a while, good thing I have a couple hours to kill" rather than "shit I have something to do in an hour...I better rush everyone!". If the tank has aggro, everyone focuses the correct mob, each pull is a walk in the park with the healer chilling on mana and the tank nice and healthy. Big aoe pulls means everyone is sitting and drinking for 10 seconds after each pull. The time saved is minimal for 
---
If everyone that agrees with OP ignores these people and doesnt invite them to group, eventually they'll be left with very little options.
---
Yeah, that's definitely the wrong way. But I'm gonna try it anyway now
---
Better dps than any weapon I have at lvl  23
---
It's hardly the same game at all now. A lot of the content is time gated so things like flying is impossible to get within a month. Raids are actually kinda cool but pvp is laughable.

Shellfish farming in Desolace is about 10g/hr

A lot of competition though so it might be a bit less. A quick google will bring up the guide for you.

ZF in the zombie room, there is a tall pot in one of the corners (think it's by the archway leading to the area with the temple in it). Jump behind the pot so you're in between the corner of the wall and the pot, you'll lose aggro.

There might be more pots like this in ZF too, not sure.

Very quickly

You can see the sunders. If it's a bear tank you can see if the health is going down and whether he is using maul repeatedly.

But mainly you can see the sunders when a war is taking.

Keep in mind, most decent locks will be draining life to get that hp back. If they abuse tap and don’t drain life, l wouldn’t heal them either.

&gt; Need before greed has always dictated whether or not the item was an immediate (or within &lt; 2 levels) upgrade, ((Need)) or if you were going to vendor/AH the item ((Greed)).
---
And like I said in my original post, this may have been the case for your server, but it was not for mine. I also said the issue is that everyone is coming from different server backgrounds with different rules, and for some reason they all think the rules the played by are the rules all the other servers played by.
---
Farmed orc reputation to get access to their mount as a Tauren. There’s repeatable quests for cloth turn ins to gain rep.

I farmed Cold-Eye basilisks in STV for my mount, the grey drops alone vendor for a lot and if you have skinning you can get a lot of thick (about 1.5g a stack on AH) and heavy leather (about 50s a stack on AH). They also drop Cold Basilisk Eye which can or sell between 1-3g on the AH depending on the server economy.

Attunement and lava runs are always emp runs, there isn’t a difference in level.  Quest runs are usually one of the other types, and fall into the same level breakdown.  There’s difference in what trash is pulled or what optional bosses are killed, but what levels participate are pretty frequently broken down in the same way.

Quite a bit of work for y'all! As a mage who's leveled ahead of my friends, any time one of my buddies hit 30 I basically hand-held them through the process and got them the axe within the hour, usually buying the liferoot and the charms for them to avoid the farming, then AoEing trolls in the jungle.

I take my rogue into gank zones like Foothills, StV or Badlands and find an unsuspecting "team mate" to shadow. I pick a someone soloing near contested spawns and wait/follow. Usually someone will try to gank them within minutes and I have the perfect ambush opportunity on the wannabe ganker. Don't even care if they are grey. If you want to gank then prepare to be ganked.

That's pretty nice! I was a feral druid who was forced to heal back in vanilla. I am very aware of the tanking abilities of druids.
---
Depends on the class. In Classic, Int doesn't give you Spell Power, so the only source of it is on gear. For Mages, + Spell Power trumps all.
---
Maybe I'm just old and don't get it, but isn't that the point of having an opposite faction? So there's a 'bad guy' and the whole point is 'fuck those guys' for the sake of the game's narrative?
---
I don't think these people understand that one of the points of the game is for me to kill them, and for them to try and kill me right back...
---
Oh, sure - however there are *a lot* of folks that enter a group and try to tell it to do it *their* way - and a lot of those people happen to be mages that want AoE pulls.
---
It is funny how right Barlows Blog constantly is. This warrior is exactly the same as he described.
---
Discuss. Loot. Rules. Before. Run. Starts.
---
&gt; because as a mage you are indeed supposed to be a good DPS class in every raid  
---
No, you misunderstand. Not saying it was good game design, but the game's design was that not every class was good for every raid. In current retail you can play one character and do everything on it, pve, pvp, raid as every role your class offers, farm gold, do quests, fuck around in the capital, you name it. You can roll anything you want and get to experience literally every boss encounter with that single character and still contribute. In vanilla that's simply not the case, there are encounters where certain classes are just useless.
---
VW can def hold aggro by itself, in a party it gets sketchy. However, my 32 warlock friend and I (32 priest) ran our low level mage friend through DM and VW was able to tank pretty damn well through the whole thing. Just have to wait for him to regen mana
---
World pvp is fun. A level 60 camping level 30 questing zones isn't pvp though, there's no competition in it. It's just killing people who have no way to actually retaliate. A group of lvl 30-40 horde guarding SM is fun, at least there's a chance for allies to rally together and fight it out. In reality, it's 5 or 6 level 55+ one-shotting groups of low-30s. 
---
Skirmishes and giant battles between the factions in STV are exhilarating, and even if it's not well balanced at least I still have a chance of picking off a couple of horde boys before being mowed down by theirl sent.
---
the mount will be there, the exact timeline for when each phase is released has not been shared with us though
---
How about a Hunter rolling need on Edgemaster's?
---
Out of fanta
---
Note, it’s not just fighting with the pet, it’s using the ability you wish to learn until it’s added to your pet spell book. Example you can learn prowl outside of combat by spamming it when it’s available.
---
Don't heal your dps too much. You probably are pulling threat because the dps afte getting hit too much and you're healing them and one they lay off, you have far more threat than the tank.
---
Sometimes I'm waiting for healer mana, I'm marking targets, I'm waiting for bloodrage to come off of cooldown, I'm waiting for grenade cooldown, and sometimes I'm waiting for a pat to turn around and walk away.
---
I'm never just sitting there picking my nose.
---
If a tank is ever going too slow just tell them. I'm always more than happy to chain pull mobs as long as I am being given the space to do my job properly. Even just putting 'r' in chat is good enough.
---
Pulling as a dps is never going to make the dungeon go faster, its only going to make things more chaotic and messy.
---
Ah got you, what’s efficient cause I can spams dungs as a tank or quest idk what to do, all I know is I really want my mount as soon as possible
---
If you run a spec with succ you either use fear or seduction to bait wotf. If he uses it deathcoil him, dot / get distance and he has only a 2 sec window to be fear immune which is usually not enough to engage with you again bevor you can fear him for real this time.
---
Again a good lesson for ZF is just don’t invite mages. That dungeon has rotted their brain.
---
Interrupts should avoid spell batching from a philosophical standpoint. There was a developer interview to this point from an ex wow dev that interrupts and traps were instantaneous. If blizzard dropped this behavior to implement spell batching then they're idiots.
---
“Clever girl...”
---
Right, more like 7 figures.
---
Wow! thanks for all the great tips, very much appreciate
---
Your life should be in scarlet monestary 33-45. You actually make good money from grey/green/blue item sells in there. Just get ravager and accept your fate for the next 7 levels.
---
Okay! Lol good to know thank you!!
---
As someone who farmed for days and days in vanilla to get one, this is super depressing..
---
Lucky bastard!
---
You are doing well on your way for the mount. Don't forget you'll also have to train at 40.

Owl is int spirit, can be good cloth or leather.

What should hopefully be an easy one, class colored name frames.

I have this working on retail.  Paste of the addon I'm using there follows.  The class icon portrait and healthbar class color still work:  https://pastebin.com/un2pPvRX
---
I am 46 as enhancement and still easily tanking dungeons, healing dungeons, and competing on dps charts against locks and mages. 
---
Enhancement is the true endgame, love yourself, love thy crits.
---
We don’t have a mana pool. We just have a health pool twice the usual size, and out spells cost health.
---
Maybe join a guild?
---
I find some amusement in trying to push AoE farming mages out of an area. You can generally ruin their day a bit by sitting in the central parts of their farm zone and killing mobs one by one. Eventually they won't really be able to tag mobs en masse any more and will be forced to leave. Just requires you to be a class that can sustain and chain kill mobs.
---
Netherwind regalia from Blackwing Lair, mostly.
---
This is me when I'm a shaman and I get in a dungeon as DPS while leveling...and the healer is awful and I just end up throwing more heals than they do.
---
&gt; Them I'm sure when people ask for help you won't be a total dick... Which AGAIN, is what this post is about.
---
This post isn't about what happens when people ask me for help. This post is what happens when you think you're entitled to my fucking help.
---
&gt;If you take the time to mouth off to people trying to remedy the above situation and THEN proceed to do nothing - this applies to you. Does it
---
How many times does it need to be said that I have no problems with people simply asking for help. Are you reading any of the comments in this thread?
---
Right, just like Tiger can be good on Mail or Leather, too. Just giving some general advise without overwhelming the guy.
---
If you're on Grobbulus and have been having good luck, downvote me and then invite me to your party so I can come find you and let you /spit on me. I'll try anything... or do anything..........
---
They don't really apply to 5 man trash clearing. Threat meters are great for bosses and anything with exceptionally high life but are pretty useless when 2 Frostbolt crits can kill a mob.
---
Possibly CoD returns then?
---
PVE vs PVP realm also matters, e. g. PVE players are more inclined to buy buffs (food, scrolls, potions) as these effects disappear when you die in PVP.
---
I think you accidentally used my screenshot
---
The sound of a female troll telling me about how her 14 kids are proud of her for going one week without smoking? Yeah I hear it
---
Hush. He can tank however he likes. His problem is that there is not an agreed on plan that he and the DPS are sticking to.
---
If that doesn't work, consider something like Bartender.  I know it supports bar switching for forms.
---
299 up-votes and counting say you're not correct. Maybe it's not your cup of tea but plenty of people are enjoying it
---
Fair warning, we horde love to pick alliance off as they make the run so be prepared to corpse hop a bit
---
I agree. Its one thing for two active spells/abilities to go off at once, but the whole point of interrupts are for the other player not to get the cast off
---
Nah bruh, that's why every single high warlord/grand marshal used the mace, amirite?
---
Turns out Bluto is an MC priest

When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
---
So I've got good news and bad news. Yes, Ele will feel better, but no it won't feel good and you'll still be drinking after every 3 mobs.
---
Two important differences between ele and enh:
---
If you get jumped by 2 mobs as an ele you're going to be fine while as enh you're going to struggle. By the time a mob walks up to you, you've cast 3 lightning bolts and a shock. That mob is 1/3 hp and fairly easy to finish off with lightning shield, weapon enhanced 1h (your offhand should be a shield for tankiness) and searing totem. This gives you plenty of resources left over to deal with mob2 in the form of spamming shocks.
---
Second main issue, Ele is vastly better at PvP. Your damage is still incredibly bursty, but it doesn't rely on crits. You don't need (or want) to stay in melee against melee classes which means you can kite/ignore a portion of their kit.
---
I was in exactly your position, I had the sick ravager axe, great gear, and I was getting stomped. Stormstrike costing more mana than a shock and dealing less damage was frankly an insult. The only downside to ele is either spending a fair chunk on water or flying to ogrimmar each day to beg for mage water before I can do anything.
---
Weapon speed doesn't matter for shammies without stormstrike, just use the most recent enhance you bought and it's fine. I actually prefer fire because it's reliable and splits damage type from being purely physical.
---
As for dungeons... just don't try to go as a dps. Ele shaman have even worse sustained damage than enh. They can burst a mob down while soloing easily enough, but dungeon fights usually run beyond their capabilities.
---
Btw, stack pure int tending towards mail where possible. Your damage is great if you have the mana to cast it.
---
Great album. I sometimes listen to it at work.
---
You're certainly an exception, but it seems that reddit's general perspective of mages one month into Classic is that they're largely comprised of entitled assholes.
---
Personally I actually haven't tanked for any mages that were truly toxic, but I also play on a dad server in Fairbanks. Some were AoE happy, but never got anyone killed because of it.
---
Herbs aren't worth a lot right now, I think mining is better gold. It's crazy that most skinners are just vendoring their leather because it's worth shit. But then it's probably the most convenient out of the 3 with quite some big hotspots to farm.
---
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeb
---
To be fair, I asked yesterday if I should switch to Prot for late game dungeons. I was told it wouldn't be a huge deal breaker.
---
That fucking jump....
---
Man the sound was one of the best parts of the game! You can get lost just listening to the nature or the music
---
I gave up prior to 20
---
Huh
---
Thanks this resource looks great, it’s all up to date and will work with classic?
---
Nah, he's right. Most speccs do singletarget and the typical fight will look like this: Tank, Rogue and Hunter open up on one target, which dies within 10-15 seconds. If I dot one of the other 2-3 targets, I pull aggro because the tanks usually don't properly offtank them.
---
WL will stand out on longer fights like bosses or when adds are pulled due to higher mana/dps efficiency and life tap, but dps doesn't really matter in leveling dungeons anyway.
---
What does this mean? Dead or alive server?
---
😅
---
Already posted once in here, but gonna submit another. A Classic version of MoveAnything.
---
time to just raid gadgetzan and camp there for some hours just so those crying kids cry even more and u can see blizzard making it a non pvp zone
---
You know why they always think that way? Cause you don't think much of the overleveled guy who passed you without killing..
---
I levelled a rogue and hunter to 35 and a mage to 27 and hated all three so I said fuck it, made a Druid and sent all my gold to him and deleted everything else. I’m sticking to the Druid now.
---
How do people do this while I get to pick where I level up thing?
---
I haven't found anything yet that doesn't, but I haven't tried everything.
---
Its a hearthstone just on a separate and shorter cooldown.
---
yup! that did it, thanks for catching it.
---
Do you know if there is any way to switch back to your previous weapon after requiping the rod?
---
No they can't. I like how people are trying to prove me wrong by saying they tanked some random lvl 20 dungeon, yeah so can hunter pets/voidwalkers. Anything is viable at lvl 20, no one cares what the balance is at that lvl.
---
Consider shifting WASD to ESDF(also consider moving tab targeting to A). Opens up a lot of room because Z, X, and more number keys become more accessible.
---
On my server there were still times when there was 0 of popular items like rune cloth bags or arcanite bars on the auction house last week.
---
Some servers changed it to VC after Dire Maul came out, while other servers didn't. Just some people just can't grasp that other people used different terminology than them. It's just like spanish, one word can mean something completely innocent in one version of Spanish, yet can mean something raunchy in another version of Spanish.
---
Wow, passive aggressive.
---
Are.. are you okay?
---
For the gram
---
Most healers realize to not stand in melee.  That goes out the window when the mage is kiting.  Interrupt a heal and let someone die?  Or keep them alive and lose the ranged buffer?  Not sure why you're being pedantic in the first place here.  As a resto shaman my go to heal is 2.5 seconds.  If I use my 1.5 second, I'm going to oom, and I have nothing instant without burning a 3 minute cd.
---
I run around and lick people as a shaman on Thalnos, I try to spread positivity, I just feel like you need something... different here. haha
---
Lack of quests imo
---
&gt; Where would all these horde PVP players go?
---
Fucking roll alliance? Stop playing the way more populated faction? Help with player balance because at the end of the day the only people bringing balance to factions are the players themselves?
---
&gt; Stacking spirit really cuts down on our recovery time between pulls.
---
Yes but only if you're armor switching. If you're wearing it while tanking you're sacrificing a lot of more useful stats. A stack of food and bandages takes up much less space.
---
Most good hunter items until Maraudon are random drops from trash in instances or rare spawn bosses. So don't count on it.
---
The ilevel of the food has to be less than 10 level below your pet in order for it to give max happiness. This means you can feed them the ilevel 45 food for max happiness all the way to level 55, so for fruit that would be moon harvest pumpkin. At pet level 55 you would need to change to deep fried plantains for it to give max happiness.

Abstract art.

You can totally report the other faction you just have to open a ticket and describe what has happened.
---
Oooo I see
---
I am doing exactly the same thing.
---
All female dwarves and gnomes, and a female NE druid.
---
Since I have a full time job, wife and kids. I don't have the time to lvl them up all to lvl30 like you did.

It goes like this:
---
	\[lvl35\] (Female Dwarf - Paladin) \[0/0/26\]	
---
	\[lvl20\] (Female Dwarf - Warrior) \[5/0/5\]	
---
	\[lvl20\] (Female Dwarf - Rogue)	 \[10/0/0\]		
---
	\[lvl10\] (Female Dwarf - Hunter)			
---
	\[lvl18\] (Female Dwarf - Priest)	 \[8/0/0\]
---
	\[lvl10\] (Female Night Elf - Druid)
---
	\[lvl5\] (Female Gnome - Mage)
---
	\[lvl5\] (Female Gnome - Warlock)
---
don't worry, I accidentally wen't to Darkshore for my Tauren Druid class quest
---
Oh really? Never thought of it this way. The server I'm on is kinda busy as well (Mograine-EU) so who knows it's the same here like you had on Whitemane. I'm glad you're making friends on the new realm!
---
Sorry mate, I'm a Mage, I don't have the answers. [Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/) does though!
---
Has some nice drops for Warriors, a good shield, good dagger and sword, and a good 2hander as well.
---
At first it is very confusing but after a few runs it is not that bad. If you can kite the dark iron dwarves it helps a lot.
---
I'm a big fan of Guild and Faction Tooltip
---
Thank you
---
Anything can tank while lvling, that's not what i'm talking about. Rogues can tank any dungeon boss while lvling, simply because they all die during the duration of evasion.
---
Once you start doing lvl 50+ dungeons you'll understand, but shaman tanks aren't a thing.
---
You can run a variation of spell cleave with a tank/3 mages/priest and it is still amazing xp. ZF farms were fast levels.
---
Mat Daemon actually 8)

Oh boy I didn’t even think of the extra training. Thank you’!

&gt; She already dead bruh

That's what *they* want you to think.

I just rolled an alliance alt on Heartseeker, too.  It was like 9am (obligatory in the morning) and world chat was popping.  
---
I don't understand why people are so alarmist,  Transfers take time.

I was just talking with a buddy about how level 47 is the most useless level of all because no class gets anything. APPARENTLY NOT.

World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth is the seventh expansion pack for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft, following Legion. It was announced at BlizzCon on November 3, 2017.
---
I think it was in good fun but i get the frustration, first of all jumping in n out of UBRS to find Ren, then hoping he drops it, THEN having to roll against probably at least 4 or 5 clothies, so i get the frustration xD
---
This was very helpful. Thank you!
