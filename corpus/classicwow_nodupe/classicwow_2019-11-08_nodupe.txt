I have about half the mats for hide of the wild and a guildy got the pattern last night which he was then stuck in IF making it for everyone lol 
---
 Yeah once I seen the orb price I was like yeahhhhh jma grind that a bit lol I havnt even made it there yet. I've been working in my ony attunement and on Sunday jumped ship to this new and much larger guild since they are very short on holy priests.
---
Right.. so they grew more this quarter than they ever have before. Say they were at 3 million in Q2 and grew 3 million more in Q3. If 3 million was the highest rate of growth of any quarter to date, they’d still be a far cry from the 12 mill + they were in WotLK.
---
15 year old game, with that level of growth in a quarter is absurd, but there is no way more people are playing this game now than in ~2010.
---
Note: numbers I provided are just examples. Would love to know how many subscribers there are but Blizz would be foolish to release that
---
No it is not a translation error speedrun strays use it to make more room, and allow I'm stuck shortcuts
---
Cats chase stuff they dint want to eat all the time like lasers
---
In most situations Dark Advisor Pendant is better dps. You can use [Zephan's warlock simulation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKD1SXeQWfoZKHO7zZUnQk3iixzfYF_BqkzQ-V_Pj6U/edit#gid=877497239) to check what is better with the gear you have. :) 
---
The sp to crit/hit values depend a bit on how much sp/crit/hit you already have.
---
Common sense
---
There were just less players on servers back then. There for sure was lag on higher pop servers.
---
I mean I was thinking about the city raids I did back in vanilla with 2 raids groups.
---
Most I got was 2 from one node twice!
---
But.. but... death ray.
---
The old Rayo the Deayo
---
Is that auctioneer telling you the vendor price/auction price/disenchant price? If so, do you have to set it up? I have auctioneer and mine is super scuffed.
---
I would just use sixtyupgrades. It tells you where they come from in a handy table underneath after you've built a set out.
---
If you have no room, hearthstone is ok to toss. Also auto sell grey items addons are great for keeping bags clean.
---
There's Green Leather Armor from lvl 155 leatherworking at lvl 26, but aside from that the quest rewards are horde and rest are random green drops.
---
The next one is STV's Raptor Mastery giving Raptor Hunter Tunic at lvl 28
---
Ya I played on. West coast server so i mine at like 7-9am EST when it is 4-7am for them lol. EPL is empty at those hours
---
I dont know where the source is but 3k is the amount usually said for vanilla server caps and they incrased it to 10k or more for classic ( i dont think they have actuallly said the real amount)
---
So where are these relic coffers? I ran BRD for first time ever last night and got like 4 keys I think and my group had no idea what to do with them or didn't care to elaborate lol
---
&gt; It's not "making excuses" just because you don't like it.
---
no they didnt
---
&gt; "Ignoring performance problems, the performance was way better that blizz's servers."
---
Clearly crashing is not the same as this rubberbanding lagfest.  If you can't see the difference then I can't help you.
---
&gt; Haven't seen it and we raid on tuesday at primetime on herod
---
Then you haven't been engaged in any large scale pvp, simple as that.
---
Because you know how both work behind the scenes. Thank you for your IT knaaawledge.
---
You have evidence of this rampant un-caught cheating, yes?
---
Almost everything you said is wrong.
---
Backstab is a 150% dmg multiplier, so +5 dmg becomes 7.5dmg per backstab, not 12.5.  Ambush is 250%, not 350%.
---
Now, 100 strength = 100ap with equals 7.14 DPS not damage.  To find the damage you multiple the dps increase by the speed of the weapon.  Most daggers a rogue is going to main hand is 1.8 speed, so 7.14 x 1.8 = ~13 dmg.
---
Apparently 5 &gt; 13!
---
also back then when big fights actually happend once in a blue moon, it did lag the servers out and not just in one zone, it could potentially crash the whole server and every zone at once
---
Additionally, no statistical analysis is done. What is our level of significance? If we collect a larger sample size, the p-value must be collected to find if the observed mean of flight times with and without the stick are likely to be within so many standard deviations of the population mean.
---
it's not the hardware though, the hardware is not potato, it's 2019
---
it's the server architecture
---
missing precision and weapon expertise is going to hurt your dps significantly.  you will still do ok damage im sure...but you are going to miss a ton
---
You can't just post hours without context. 2.5 hours average a day over 90 days is casual for an online game. I don't know what more to tell you. 
---
Sorry that you fell behind? 
---
I only hit 60 recently myself, I'm in my 30s with a family and 2 jobs and would consider myself pretty casual. I'm in a casual guild that hasn't cleared MC yet and everyone else is around the same timeline as me and the same life situation.
---
If you are in the 30s-40s right now you are behind the casuals in my opinion and i imagine in blizzards opinion, you can see it in game the groups for lower level stuff have dropped off considerably since a month ago and LFG is always full of pug raids and level 60 content vs a month ago when it was full of leveling dungeons.
---
I'm not going to keep replying because clearly you do not see it the same as I do but i don't understand why you are basing your entire view on hours without context and then data counting alts and name reserves.
---
Do you have evidence that they didn't?
---
Get that Ony attune, the [priest helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16921/halo-of-transcendence) she drops is insane.
---
If you start the first part of the quest where you have to dress up as a dragon, I would honestly just wait for other people doing the same thing in that cave and then try to group up with them.  That way you will all be on the same step at the same time.
---
I managed to get lucky and join a group doing it and we banged the whole thing out in like an hour.
---
How is it more risky than a guarantee worst game, that TBC is, let alone WOTLK
---
Meh doubt.
---
To fix the servers first you have to fix the players, having them migrate from high pop servers to low pop ones. As it looks the main issue about server lag is how monolithic the structure is, and merely having more players in a single server ( either kalimdor or EK of one specific realm ) can caus eproblems in said server regardless on the place you are in, unless you are in a city ( that looks like it is handled like a server of its own ) or an instance.
---
Most probably they will release P2 in time regardless and let the burned out people transfer realm.
---
I remember seeing an article mentioning how bad laser pointers are for dogs and cats.
---
It has something to do with the sudden appearance of the laser, then its just gone. It would lead to the animals staring at spots on the wall for hours waiting for it to come back.
---
In some extreme cases, they would stop eating and sleeping, in anticipation of the laser.
---
People noticed the dog, or cat, would only eat in the darkness.
---
If i find the article i'll link it.
---

---
ooh that warlock simulation looks interesting haha and really in details ! Thanks alot for the tip
---
i love this thread reads like something from r/conspiracy lmao
---
Thanks a lot! If you're prioritization for PvP do you ever go Cold blood or Prep? Or do you take both for daggers?
---
Show what? If you're talking about DPS on trash people don't actually log those. There is one for full raid DPS, but there isn't exactly a good indication of how those raids went or how they pulled trash. However, if you want that;
---
Full Raid DPS:
---
Hunter- 650 DPS
---
Feral- 664 DPS
---
The other reason why it's not very accurate is because if they used World Buffs at one point in the raid and no World Buffs at other points in the raid, it would be very skewed based upon how efficient the group cleared and when their World Buffs went away. At that point it would be less about how the class performs and more about how the raid performs.
---
Except 200v200 pvp is still going to happen even if on non-full servers so this is kinda stupid to suggest.
---
U.N. Owen was her? Great music choice
---
He should do solo runs not jump runs.
---
blizzard: use common sense and listen to us on server balancing, since you don't know shit about our architecture.
---
This is all true, HOWEVER, it does seem like the proliferation of reserve runs MAY be reducing the total number of non-reserve runs across the board. SO a player might feel that in vanilla they used to be able to find rend runs (for example) where they were able to roll off on loot and now they feel like there are far fewer of those runs available because the only people who aren’t joining those reserve runs are the ones who need the same loot which leads to an unbalanced party.
---
30 years old, with 3 kids. Been 60 for a few weeks and sporting a few MC drops.
---
I’m a lock. I leveled with this. I got many procs when casting drain soul when my final shadow bolt was on its way to deliver the killing blow. You’re posting wrong information.
---
wont happen
---
paid server transfer will happen but faction change is never coming to classic.
---
I wish but I did sell two out of the three names I had reserved
---
Floating crystals, energy beams, and neon soup is what you might expect from a fel exploded world. I like it for the style and that it fits with how it *should* look, according to lore.
---
I’m sure there’s a better smart person way to do it, but I use an addon that’s called something like “inFlight Taxi Timer” that gives me a time for my flights. Don’t know if it can be set to milliseconds, so maybe best used on long flight times. Seems like it would be better than relying on an outside timer with human error.
---
not layered &lt;&gt; medium pop. I know the neckbeard narrative is layering but that's really not it.
---
Yeah, yeah they seem to.  Almost as if people in technical jobs are more likely to play mmorpgs.... weird huh.  Just because *you* don't understand modern server architecture doesn't mean other people here are as ignorant.
---
I wouldn't mind 1 week of misery for the rank considering what it meant back then. But the 11 weeks before that makes it really fucking miserable.
---
Pushing r12+ made me hate pvp so much I avoided BGs and arenas for 10 years. Gotta appreciate the dedication of people who got it without account sharing and were actually good at pvp. Even if it is a little crazy/stupid to spend that much time on a game in 2005-2006 when there's no real world gain and no Twitch to stream your insanity on. 
---
Now with so much theorycrafting and wintrading etc, combined with #nochanges, it's prolly just a race of who can stay online the most while watching Netflix.
---
This is a problem we ran into.
---
Bob and Jim both want mageblade.
---
Bob's class has tier that is pretty decent
---
Jim's class has tier that is bad
---
If we give bad tier away for free then Jim get's an advantage on mageblade over Bob. If we force Jim's class to pay for their tier then we have to choose who is going to get fucked.

Nope
---
improved hamstring -&gt; first aid
---
How the fuck are you going to start a fight with a crusader proc already?  
---
I was wrong on my modifiers but that doesn’t change the fact that 5 dmg 100% is greater than 7.14 dmg rarely...
---
Again. Pointing to parses literally means nothing as a healer. Both heals have their proper uses and pointing to your 99 parses is nothing more than bragging over something irrelevant.
---
Also their implementation of SpellQueueWindow on Retail kinda ruined it during Cataclysm, I get so much input lag on Legion/ BfA in 30 man pug raid groups I can’t even use spells, I don’t know what they did wrong honestly, but I felt it the most during Legion and BfA... They should have just let Nostalrius people deal with development and they would have had a lot better servers running.
---
Just the fact that they used BfA downgraded client for Classic is a minus, they just should have cooporated with pserver developers I guess.
---
Edit: Grammar
---
That would work for overall velocity, but not for velocity/second, which is more accurate at a given point
---
yeah me either. everyone saying there's lag plays on a ultra high pop. It's ok. Let them have a bad time and have a laugh at their expense.
---
Can't wait to see how they fuck this up, too. 
---
~~You think you do, but you don't~~. You think they won't, but they will.
---
What? Lol
---
Yes I care more about the quality of the experience than how quickly I'll get it.
---
1. Maybe the xfer doesn't work for you. You aren't your entire server.
---
2. Your guild could xfer.
---
3. You'll make plenty of friends on a new one. It's only been out a couple months.
---
4. You're dumb
---
5. There aren't dead servers. Even the lowest has more people than the highest in classic. 
---
6. My server doesn't lag with 500 but by all means keep building those strawmen and knocking them down.
---
and yet.. woah, private servers do it better. And that's am objective fact with video evidence. Large scale pvp on pservers had less lag and problems.
---
&gt;Cheese guilds who kill bosses in 20-30 seconds
---
People who do more dps are cheesing bosses?
---
Yes... They did. Warmane still has some pretty decent cheat protection....
---
I don't play wow at all anymore and haven't for a year or so. But you seem so sure, calling others stupid when you don't know what you are talking about either.
---
Do you have an addon that calculates these ratios for you or did you do it by hand?
---
Oh yeah! I knew I'd miss something among all the patch notes, I do remember that fondly though.
---
Good news. This forces them to have a plan for continued growth. Makes classic+ more likely to happen since if they go through the normal expansions, those have a finite lifespan since everyone will be gone after WOTLK.
---
My guild was like that at the start, but now 3 weeks later and we're down to &lt;2 hours for a full clear
---
Sneaky rogues lol
---
I guess you are a mage probably with some raid gear?
---
There's probably 2x-4x as many slots for healing druids as feral in a given raid. But if you go feral you will be expected to be geared to the teeth. You'll need to seek out weird and expensive items like the warden staff or the heart of the mountain trinket. You'll have to be skilled in powershifting and have consumables, including crowd pummelers if your guild is min/maxing at all.
---
If you want to do both then look into the HOTW/NS spec. But more than likely you'll end up mostly healing.
---
You're trying to tell me that 15% uptime is better than 100% uptime.  We'll just agree to disagree...
---
Pyroclasm does not work as you'd hope, instead it divides the chance over the whole duration (or something like that) resulting in very few stuns.
---
But warlocks have good solo farm options elsewhere!
---
&gt;If there are shareholders, your company is publicly traded. They don’t own anything but stock.....making a significant difference between ownership and investment — BUT AGAIN, go off. 
---
Get an education, holy shit dude. Please, keep this shit on the internet and not your job because I seriously worry about you getting fired over saying something so stupid. You really don't even know what a freaking stock is. WOW
---
&gt;And I’m truly sorry for adding an extra E, I have broken wrist.
---
Yes, which is ironic since you're whole argument is to criticize my grammar and writing level. That's why I pointed it out. I wouldn't need to point out your stupid typos and grammar mistakes because my actual points are right and I don't need to divert the conversation into some tangent to distract from lack of knowledge. But you do. You child. Go to bed. Tomorrow, open a book and learn something. I cringe for your life and what impressions you give off to others.
---
All four raids in one night??
---
Yes, I'm still level 49...
---
Its damn good. But tbh many players will eventually drift over to retail when they get bored with the never changing classic. But all good. It’s wow also:) wow is for life.
---
db flurry is competitive af! poor warriors don't project
---
Idk, I see someone from a different guild. Definitely a pug run. /s
---
Need fingers to play the guitar, hoofie. Dwarves win again.
---
I think you could do a whole video just analyzing leetspeak in general. While it didn't originate in wow, that application for it definitely helped it propagate faster. Interesting how it's basically a dead language at this point.
---
Aside from the ZF all I can say is 40s definitely felt like that for me too. 50s feel like they are going a lot faster for me.
---
Insert https://www.myinstants.com/instant/jesus-christ-kid/. 
---
 I'm only interested in arcane crystals friend.
---
My guild “cheeses” some fights too, mainly cleaving bosses down. Perhaps I should have used a different term I guess, but my point is most guilds do not have the kill speed to maintain flash spam.
---
You want to play a gnome mage
---
I switched at 58 and it worked out perfectly.
---
It's already happening and there isn't lag. It's getting cold out. Maybe start building snowmen and instead of straw?
---
Nost provided for 800k people with 10-16k beeing online at the same time all day ever day.
---
No. They do lag.
---
Upvotes disagree. What a shit comment tho.
---
I’m lvl 56 and still can’t get the warlord’s command quest, what lvl do i need to be? I see a white escamation point but i still can’t get it
---
Yes, and beyond.
---
Shitttt I'm busted.
---
I still have “butthole” on Herod. Lvl 1 hunter. Don’t play on the server
---
battle chicken too
---
It isn't 15% uptime, it's much higher.  You have no idea how any of the mechanics work so you are just spouting something a guide said without any basis for why.
---
Everything you keep saying shows you don't know what you are talking about.  You have been wrong on everyone point of specific data so far, why do you think you know better than I do?
---
Also why does it matter to casuals how fast the content is released?
---
&gt; he problem is that the servers were too big to begin with
---
If only they had offered a solution
---
This system is the number one reason why I want BC and not Classic+. 
---
As someone who prefers structured PvP that rewards skillful play, the original honor and ranking system is such a far cry from that notion that it's honestly hard to imagine the kind of person that would feel proud of living a profoundly meaningless existence to earn such rewards.
---
Any videos to back up your claims? A single one?
---
Don’t get sour bc I level more efficiently than you. I have a full time job and a boyfriend and pay all my bills on time not very hard to do
---
I agree.
---
this is what happens when one faction's racials have dramatic pvp benefits
---
you don't have to worry about a lot of this until at least lvl 40 btw
---
most effective method of leveling is efficient questing. there are guides you can follow such as https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/nightfalls-wow-classic-horde-leveling-guide/
---
Yes
---
The only two servers they will let me transfer to are the south american servers (one portugese one spanish speaking) give me a real option and I'll take it.
---
40ies has been a breeze for me. I have basically only done ZF dungeons. Shitloads of easy xp there. Players farm it for xp.
---
Very well.  Carry on.
---
Your race is troll, that's who you need honored with for discount on raptors :) not the orcs.
---
The GM is saying that you can't fix it, a GM or other Blizzard employee would have to fix it, but his research shows that in vanilla the policy was to never fix it. He has escalated the issue to see if that can be changed or there is anything else that can be done.
---
You just have to infer from context that some of the pronouns were wrong.
---
Why are you so toxic
---
No i am a rogue, already have my hoj though and I don't know if the leader knew that or just /w the first one he saw.
---
that doesnt even make any sense
---
I'm exclusively a Classic player now and at this point I'm thinking it's unlikely I'll ever go back to retail. After playing since mid-TBC and experiencing all kinds of great moments - from being the disc priest on a realm first Heroic Lich King kill and having my name spammed across the server to everyone online at the time, to doing more chilled out 10-man raiding with a tight knit group of friends in MoP, to rejoining a server top guild again in Legion - I finally decided to hang up the towel in the first tier of BFA, even after sticking it out through thick and thin in some expansions which people would consider the low point of the game. I played the entirety of WoD - hell, I played the shit out of it. I played through change after change that I didn't necessarily agree with, but I still liked a lot of the core gameplay so I stuck it out anyway. But in BFA it finally got to the point where it became too much.
---
My reasons for quitting are probably different from most. From a healer's perspective, I absolutely couldn't stand the constant class overhauls or "exciting new ideas" Blizzard had to completely change game systems. I feel like people pick a spec/class that they like playing for a reason, and every time Blizzard has one of these of these overhauls they risk changing what many players originally enjoyed about that class. It was worse for healers from expansion-to-expansion than for any other role. Felt like every new expansion they always had some "exciting new vision" for healing and it just really wore on me after a while.
---
- First in Cata, they gave everyone a huge health pool and made healing spells restore comparatively little. The game never quite recovered from this, and it has persisted (to a lesser extent) in every expansion to this day. I missed being able to cast a massive greater heal and being able to top off a DPS in one heal. I miss when timing really mattered.
---
- Then they decided they wanted to "make healers less mobile" and gave cast times to spells that have been instant for *years*, like Prayer of Mending or Wild Growth. That's just annoying and unnecessary. 
---
- The ability pruning. I used to think it was so cool to be able to do little class-specific things, like mind soothe humanoid mobs and carefully run past them while questing or doing dungeons. Whoops, now the spell just doesn't exist anymore.
---
- Then spells which were absolute staples of my class for years (like Circle of Healing) are suddenly optional talents, and guess what? They're not even the best talent. Now instead of having both Circle of Healing and Binding Heal (two spells I'd had in my toolkit for years), I'm having to choose between them because they're on the same talent row, so several abilities which used to exist on my bars are just missing.
---
- Then they decided to just completely remove spirit as a stat (after initially just limiting it to rings and trinkets in WoD). Also, everyone has a fixed mana pool now that never scales. I used to love upgrading my character/gear and seeing my regen increase along with the size of my mana pool. Being able to customise your gear and trade output for regen or mana pool size was a cool part of character customisation which I liked.
---
- They changed all the cool mana cooldowns like innervate, while outright removing others. In the past, if a feral druid decided to chuck an innervate on a healer during fight downtime, it was always helpful because it just restored mana that I could use at any point. Now with the redesigned innervate in retail (your spell casts are free for the next 10 seconds but it restores no mana), if the druid isn't on Discord with me and doesn't perfectly coordinate when they give me innervate so I can spam as much as possible in that short window of time, chances are it will be next to useless.
---
It just got to the point in BFA when it hit me that a lot of the cool mechanics that made me enjoy healing in the first place had been changed so much that they were barely recognisable anymore, or they were just flat-out gone. I was logging on every day to run around the map for hours doing mundane world quests, just so I could play some bastardised, stripped-down version of my class that looked almost nothing like what I used to love playing.
---
Anyway, I rambled a bit there, but I just wanted to get it off my chest haha. At least classic exists now and a lot of the mechanics I used to enjoy about healing are back!
---
Lol you first
---
Awesome!  Thx for the good news!
---
Also warrior leveling is not that bad at all when it's your alt and you can buy gear upgrades off of AH constantly
---
Meat stick?
---
imagine being this fucking smug about taking a server transfer
---
Not really, it's old hat.
---
That’s what I did in vanilla and was like committed to not doing it again. All that matter though is you are enjoying it playing however you want
---
&gt; Yea my server has 50 guilds raiding MC
---
Then stop complaining about lag or start a new private server where there's no cheat detection and the people running it sell loot and gold.
---
Flash heal does have proper uses, few and far between and mostly an emergency or in prep of a short high burst window.
---
Also I disagree with you about parses, I could spam PoH in a lot of cases and parse the same % as I do healing properly. You’re not entirely wrong about parses, but it’s still a good tool.
---
Emerald dream. Uldm. That random spooky tower with the underwater chains.
---
There you go, classic plus.
---
Yes because Blizzard has always been right about their decision making.
---
I demand all future complaints and requests be in this format.
---
Keep sucking Blizzards cock moron. You know nothing.
---
I came here to say Polo...
---
WCL isn't displaying buffs properly. You can't base your entire point of "removing logs that have world buffs" on a website that doesn't even show them properly.
---
I'd know, because I was in a raid where some of those #1 parses were done, for both hunter and druid, and I can assure you we had world buffs for the entire run.
---
Besides, every decent guild is using world buffs, what's the point of excluding them? So you can see how both of those specs perform in subpar conditions?
---
This right here is good advice. No sense selling one of the best rings for your class just for some gold. However, if your form of fun is collecting gold, go for it! Gotta do what you'll enjoy the most.
---
What’s broke?  I play every day never have any issues.
---
Definitely! Despite some small missteps, they were pretty good at keeping a close eye on the community and improving the game throughout vanilla. Not the first MMO to do so, but they basically cemented it as a winning strategy.
---
We need them fat Raptor Strike crits :D
---
This is just like saying instead of curing an infection, just take some medicine to deal with the symptoms. Blizzard SHOULD be improving their servers to allow for better peformance, but instead people like you are out here saying "oh just transfer to a low pop server and you won't lag lol duh".... unrealistic expectation everyone knows why people stack on a few servers.
---
Yeah, it working on a server literally ran on a desktop in some Czech dudes garage doesn't mean it's not completely impossible.
---
Of course they could fix it.
---
But, that would cost money.
---
Ever think some people have way to much free time?
---
Where did you transfer to?
---
Holy shit your posts are horrible lmao
---
Sounds like a hard case if the git guds.
---
Yeah that's their own fucking fault
---
No one is doing angerforge only runs with hoj on reserve. Reddit makes alot of shit up.
---
Joanas guide
---
because blizzards bad idea failed that's somehow....our fault? lol ok
---
I think you over estimate how many ppl are even 60 yet.  I’m totally not stating anything I researched I’m just going off my Med/high server.  We have only a couple guilds killing ony and clearing mc.  So 4 months would not cause a mass exodus on my server
---
In all honesty I think a lot of ppl were afraid it might be vanilla graphic. Thank god it was not. Classic looks like a 2019 game in terms of graphic fidelity.
---
You need to go through dialog with him before he gives it. Click up and follow the prompts.
---
You should probably actually try it before you go on off on a rant about how it doesn’t work. Admittedly the video omits some important information about how a players GUID impacts the treat reduction. Basically if two people are stacked when a fireball hits the threat reduction is ONLY applied to the person with lowest GUID (person who’s character was created earliest). 
---
We have tried a couple of variations on this (we run 3 Onyxia groups per lockout).
---
In our group I was OT and I stacked with MT. I was third on threat and had a higher GUID.  First fireball hit MT (he lost threat as he had Lower GUID). Next fireball hit the dps second on threat (he dropped threat).  Every other fireball hit me and, because I was stacked with a person with lower GUID, I kept agro right up to P3. Onyxia landed, ran straight to me.
---
Other groups had similar experiences except the MT stacked with someone with lower GUID so never lost threat and were hit by every fireball.
---
what's wrong with you dude
---
You take that back about my boy, 1k needles

SM RUIN. MAKE BIG NUMBERS. MAKE HEALTHBARS SMALL.

Which trash server did you play on? I spent a year on Kronos 1 and it did not crash daily.
---
I too also play with Wowhead open on monitor 2.
---
Mount a coups!! Everyone stop playing!! Go outside!!
---
servers worked fine until layers were introduced.  for the rest of classic wow's lifetime we will be playing on 1 layer, not layer-free.
---
Am I fucking blind? I don't see literally anything that says or suggests that subscription numbers doubled.
---
pservers utilize the 1.12 CLIENT which is what you install on your computer, which connects to their Server. pservers maintain their own SERVER that contains the values which are different from Blizzard's reference data.
---
So, complete it.
---
Does blizzard astroturf post on this sub? Almost assuredly.
---
Ya I see all of you recommending ZF, but I’ve just noticed it’s been more difficult getting groups since I left. I guess since I was with the bulk of other players it wasn’t an issue but it seems like most have out leveled me and no one wants to run ZF. At least not during the times I can play.
---
Holy pallies are literally casters. All I do is spam flash of light
---
You want 200 person per side servers?🙄 There will always be a point where the size of the battle is too large for the server to handle. I understand wanting some more servers and capping them a little more but that isn't really relevant to the point your trying to make.
---
This is the correct answer. Hair color mattered only when the new model forms were introduced to the game.
---
I just want to make it clear.
---
You are saying the 15 second crusader proc has a 15% uptime?
---
You are aware there are 60 seconds in a minute, not 100?  At minimum and 1 ppm it's 25% uptime.
---
Second PPM is a system to determine proc rate, but the amount of total procs is increased when you attack faster than the base weapon speed and use weapon attacks.  The reality is the uptime ends up being around 40%.
---
If you multiply .4 x the 13 dmg added per attack on crusader, you average out to get 5.2
---
5.2 &gt; 5.
---
This is before factoring in the added OH damage.  Please understand some concepts of game mechanics, or even time.
---
That’s the sad part. It really just straight up won’t be fixed. All I want is to play my favourite game as it was meant to be played. But this awful company run by people who weren’t part of the game’s original development owns the IP.
---
Lmao im actually on skeram !!!! As one of my servers .. Whats ur name ingame .. Lets get u out of that shit ass guild and get u into some MC
---
Months, no. Weeks, yes. It really depends on the group's composition though. You say you want to MT, but right now are you off-tanking or dpsing and trying to get into tanking?  How many other warriors are in your raid group? 
---
You probably won't have too much trouble getting tier pieces if you are offtanking, but I wouldn't be expecting a Rag or Ony weapon anytime soon to be perfectly honest.
---
BOTH, because you can flip back and forth and level with some nice rested XP.
---
One of the main complaints from CCP themselves has been trying to port and work around the awful legacy code, it's amongst one of their favourite excuses when people complain about stuff. Look up any of CCP's programming hiring requirements, one of the main things they ask for is knowledge in porting and legacy code my dude. Also name another significant project that uses Stackless Python, bet you can't
---
If you'd rather there be lag on an English speaking server than no lag on a Brazilian server, I don't see how that preference means you aren't allowed to complain about the lag.
---
More than 20, but yes. That means Blizzard has a much easier time purchasing/renting and maintaining servers for less money than private servers could. It's just one more reason we should be expecting better performance, not worse, than what some scuffed private server offered us three years ago.
---

No.
---
It is what it says. The number of new subscriptions in Q3 was the most new subscriptions in a single quarter, beating out quarters where expansions are released.
---
But that's not *that* ridiculous, since lots of players remain subscribed throughout the expansion release process. I know I was subbed in vanilla, solidly through the BC and WotLK release, and only unsubbed when I quit in Wrath.

---
I hope some people quit.  Low level questing areas still being packed this far in is starting to piss me off.
---
You and the Blizzard shills are missing the point. No one is saying the game was perfect back then. That’s irrelevant. 
---
People are saying this can be fixed or at least improved now and it should be since we’re paying for it.
---
Oops I accidentally thought this was about when the enemy would say G O AFK.
---
Exactly, this OP sounds like a fucking BOOMER
---
Where you think they’ll be when it explodes.
---
Yep they’ll just rush out another phase and problem solved. It’s inevitable.
---
Why would one take defiance or shield block for a PvP arms build?  Seriously.  Threat doesn't mean anything in PvP! 
---
This build isn't terrible. You could swap some points from parry and grab anger management, probably a good idea since I now know it actually generates 1 rage per 3s as opposed to what the tooltip actually reads.  When I first came up with the build I didn't know this and assumed it worked differently in classic.
---
So in revision, reduce Deflection to 2/5, grab 5/5 TM and AM.  Spare points can float between improved charge or improved hamstring depending on preference.  Improved hamstring isn't bad, but it's a proc chance as opposed to guaranteed rage from improved charge.
---
Its a 2h PvP build.  As I clearly said.  I don't believe in Jack of all trade builds, hence why I said "If you're gonna PvP" directly before linking the build.
---
Literally my entire comment mentions it's a PvP only build that I'm sharing (and yes I know the OP asked for a jack of all trades build, but so what) and you still criticize it for missing key PvE talents?
---
Examples of stupid names?
---
Bruh, I read your math in the other 30 posts you've campaigned on regarding this subject.  It's clear that you're real passionate about it when I was simply going off albeit incorrect, my memory.   It's clear you've spent waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more time on this than I have.  When you try to educate people who are spreading misinformation, try not being a douche about it and maybe they'll be receptive.  Have a great day.  You are right, I am wrong.
---
Layers are effectively separate servers in this context. And I would estimate 4-6k per layer. But it's all guesswork in the end.
---
Yeah they’ve clearly given up on fixing this. Radio silence.
---
So in other words we don't have large scale pvp because there are trash human beings that cheat.
---
*if honored with home faction
---
I agree you are on point, but I also feel people are totally valid in voicing their complaints that the current experience is not working as intended for them. 
---
The speculation and talk of how it should be easy to fix though is where I agree with you.
---
My guild doesn't expect much from me other than stay alive so I can totem twist. my gear is pretty good and I can stay competitive on pure DPS fights. Is there a way to link my gear in a PM? I'm really torn over the crusader/Haste.
---
Lol quoting dollar figures and not knowing what you're talking about is the biggest cop out. "They make so much there must be a way! Take all of the money and just stuff it physically into the servers to make them work 4head"
---
ap is being removed in shadowlands
---
I love it for the iron mining loop, but it's my least favorite questing location in the game. Loads of same-y centaur camps and narrow bridges to cross, forcing you to fight every mob along the way.

*However*, I'm not talking about the flats, that place is great. I should have specified above.

Is the ring shield a magic buff? because if so then it will probably just be cleansed by Garr. Golemag for sure.
---
Healing parses are based largely on the healing assignment you have for any given fight. If you're always assigned to MT healing you will parse better than the rest of the healers by default. You can however look at spell usage as it's the biggest takeaway from warcraftlogs. 
---
The best ways to judge a healer are spell usage and whether or not you are completing your assignment properly. When content is more mana intensive overhealing will play a bigger factor in seeing whether or not a healer is good. With how trivial MC is overhealing is a nonfactor.
---
&gt;Did those servers have monitoring, logging, and analytics? Storage and database redundancy? Cyber attack protection? Backend processes for GM support, AH, and instances to prevent lock outs?

Rogue stealth runs are where it’s at (if you’re a rogue and able to do it)

Wintergrasp and TolBarad were the best they could compromise, and they were often lagfests too.

Haha. Surely the mage was trolling.
---
i said it was from vanilla to S3 of TBC. then they got buffs to mace spec and stuff and took over the 1v1 against warriors

I still think it's best use is in 5-man dungeons. Helps to limit downtime and really make things go smooth.

Hey man, I didn't say they were good -- I'm just asking for equal treatment.

Both lions and eagles which make up the gryphon, are both obligate carnivores. While I'm sure a gryphon would be large enough to swallow a bunch whole. I highly doubt they would have the inclination to choose to comsume them

3.) I seriously doubt you've ever had any friends on a large server.

4.) You're an absolute fucktard.
---
5.) One person said their said had FOUR raiding guilds. That's not dead to you? People drop off more than you think and it'll keep going down.
---
6.) You're a fucking liar if you're saying 500 people pvping doesn't lag you on your server. 
---
Post a video right now. I seriously doubt you will. Lying off your ass like that about something like that makes it so clear you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
From about lvl 52 onwards your doing dungeons that have your Pre Raid BIS gear. So anytime in that window would be a good time. You will probably be able to get more groups faster as resto. Also youl have better priority on those resto pieces of gear you want if your the healer.
---
“They should fix and improve issues”
---
That’s all your post needed to be. Everything else is completely irrelevant.
---
Spamming - no. Use one time for debuff and forget for 30 seconds.  
---
Demo roar generate 39 threat * 145% = 56 
---
For example Faery Fire in human form generate 108 threat. And in bear - zero (ok it also give you pull threat).  
---
And warrior's Battle Shout give 91 threat per person buffed.
---
Yes. I feel like p2 is being released too early. Even if they did nothing I’d rather p2 be delayed.
---
Holy Shock to me is basically another CD to add burst damage, not a great investment in talents if you're just raiding. Depends on what you doin the game most often.
---
I will take floating crystals and energy beams over skulls, spikes, and fire any day.

you have to lead the target a little if they're moving. it takes some practice

Why so many wow players have cats. They are gross

Well shit

You mean those that shut down soon after release? Or those that are basically dev/beta servers? Or do you mean the stupid P2W servers? TBC servers usually just suck, super buggy or cash grabs, or mostly both.
---
&gt; MC loot ruined wow classic though.

&gt; It forced everyone to do MC even if they liked the old content because drops in MC were better than most OG blues.

Boots + shoulders is best in AQ.
---

---
Solo jump runs as a priest are a bit dicey and gear dependant. Jump boss runs are pretty easy comparatively.
---
Usual DPS raid compilation is 10-13 warriors, 8-10 mages, 8-10 rogues, 5-7 hunters and 4-6 warlocks, 1 feral druid, 0-1 Shadow Priest.
---
You’d be the minority
---
The mage definitely knew he was helping the warrior there hahaha
---
I guess technically that’s true, yeah. They don’t get 30% extra crit on their special attacks with them though
---
Battles throughout history have also shown that people can win against overwhelming odds. All it takes is a great commander, like me. You seem very brave. You'd make a great front-line fighter in my army. My personal guard and I will handle the flanking. Want to join my guild?
---
A raid can take 3h.
---
Max bag space is 18 per bag
---
A MCP is 5 charges for what? 10 seconds?
---
Youd use all your bags before the first raid boss.

And that's like 6h of farming mcp.

Everyone keeps saying FD is broken, but I've yet to ever run into an issue FD + Trapping. Solo, in groups, in dungeons, in world PvP. Do people not realize that you have to stop to FD and have your pet on passive when you do so or something? It's acting exactly as I remember it.
---
You can't double trap like you could in BC with trapping two mobs, as the current version breaks any active traps you have up if you try to place another, but you can easily re-trap a mob with FD for CC in a party. Again, normal vanilla behavior as I can't recall Double trapping becoming a thing until BC.
---
Nope, that stuff is super easy to calculate. It's more likely to do with sharding which is how the current infrastructure is built.

Judging wisdom and autoing in 5 mans is an easy way to get pummelled and interrupted from casting for a few critical seconds.

WHY DOES BLIZZARD NOT CARE ABOUT REFORGED
---
It’s not blizz’s fault.. they’ve offered server transfers multiple times but people refuse to go. On Arcanite Reaper we need more people.
---
Loot councils done right are the best loot rules for a raiding guild and here is why.
---
Clearing MC in 3 hours instead of 4 is better for everyone.
---
Giving a 3rd tier piece to a DPS who shows up to every raid is more useful than giving a 2nd tier piece to a DPS who only comes every other week or shows up weekly but frequently quits before the end of the raid making clearing Rag and Domo that much harder.
---
The whole raid will benefit weekly off the regular who now has a 3 Tier piece bonus than the guy who doesnt log as much time in raid and would do less damage with said upgrade.
---
The same logic can be extrapolated over various loot situations but the short version is if you are a top performer who shows up all the time your getting loot tends to be more beneficial than a less skilled player who shows up irregularly.
---
Even if the two players are equal, the guy getting a 3 piece set is likely going to be more valuable in his next raid than the guy getting up to his second T1 piece.
---
The smoother the raid the better for all.
---
Raid gear should be given out based on the benefit to the raid as a whole, not the ego stroking of the individual. But, or course, sometimes a person who hasn't been getting loot should get loot simply because they've happily passed on several pieces for the benefit of the raid. This is good for the raid not from a stats standpoint but from a player retention standpoint.
---
It's much more efficient to gear people you know are staying than newbies who may take their first piece and go to another guild or quit the game.
---
DKP and EGGP dont account for any of that. It's fair to everyone from a technical standpoint, but that also means people who show up all the time who are suffering longer raid times cause the weak links are getting gear have no choice but to suck it up.
---
Loot councils on the positive end of the spectrum are far better for the guild as a whole and raid progression when done fairly and in the interest of the whole raid.
---
With that said, corrupt loot councils are by far the worst of all as well.
---
This is perfect, exactly what I was looking for.
---
Thanks.
---
Really? I cant wait for TBC.
---
That’s literally the point of the game. You go with your friends into raids to get gear. Then you wear that gear to kill the other faction. 
---
Gearing separately for PvP and PvE wasn’t really a thing until they added resilience in TBC and it ruined the game for people who wanted to raid and then PvP. Instead you were forced to do arena which was the only viable way to gear for PvP.
---
Stock is down after hours on this earnings report lol damn
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah, big groups going into SW or ORG for a PvP raid would always lag shit out. The AQ event? Crashed servers back in the day every fucking time. This lag issue was always a thing in Vanilla. I thought people wanted NO CHANGES?
---
Is that % fact?
---
I know a lot of people are gone.
---
How is it going pretty fast? People keep saying that with nothing to back it up. Since before classic even released they said their goal was phase 2 about 3 months after launch, were getting phase 2 at 2 months and 2 weeks after launch. Is it a little fast sure but it's not like it's crazy rushed and it is easily comparable with when phase 2 hit vanilla originally. I get that it may be faster then you would like but that doesn't mean it's going fast.
---
Paladins.
---
wow, first gold. Props to B.I.G for this.
---
Max Rank Lightning Bolt deals 453 damage on average. If you add +14 spell damage, you'd increase this by 2.65%. If you add +1% spell critical (same itemization budget on gear), it's only 1%.
---
To equalize these values, you'd need +872 spellpower.
---
Another way to look at this is to regard 1% critical as worth about 5 spellpower (this varies with gear, but it's a decent estimate on max rank) - which means that unless a gear is a massive iLvl upgrade, spellpower will be better than critical.
---
Elemental Shaman also don't receive any special benefit to critical beyond simply having 200% criticals.
---
The exception to this is Elemental Devastation, which is a very different sort of build.
---
In theory, +nature damage is even more lopsidedly superior to critical - but there are relatively few decent pieces of +nature gear.
---
If you're looking at mana efficiency, the comparison becomes even more lopsidedly in favor of spellpower. If you downrank to Rank 4 to fish for procs, that +14 spellpower is a whopping 12.77% increase to your dps... compared to a 1% increase from critical.
---
And that's before you take into consideration supplemental sources of damage like Lightning Shield (which receive a +100% spellpower coefficient on an instant cast) and totems.
---
When Bgs come in world PvP dies. You can't bring in world PvP after Bgs because then you aren't adding anything. It would be like releasing molten core in phase 6.

Honestly I’ve kinda stopped reading anything past the first sentence at this point. Mostly because it’s bound to remind me of the conversations I had when I worked in a hospice with dementia patients.
---
The thing is, not everything has to be unknown, just re-imagined. Karazhan exists, it can be re-deployed into the world, there's even an opportunity to add new loot.
---
BE zones, Hyjal, Worgen Zone all exist and could be re-introduced to fill Azeroth out.

I welcome the concept of Classic+, especially because it's disappointing to know that I'll leave the game around WotLK, I won't continue into Cata if they just plug in each patch sequentially.

just if it wasn't clear; i'm calling out all the  developers and software designers  and what not we have in this sub that are defending blizzard cus you know "they work in the business" so everyone that's complaining about the problems with lag just doesn't understand how it all works. Meanwhile they're throwing out wild speculations about what the actual problem is (when in truth they're as clueless as anyone, since none of us knows the inner workings at blizz) and calling other people "armchair" developers, when they’re the one doing the exact same thing, fucking lol. ¨
---
edit: 
---
also regarding private servers,
---
We can all tell this isn't working as we want it to work. And  yes, it is  unacceptable that pserver made it work, no matter how butchered or different their code and set - up was from classic wow. Obviously there are major differences between pservers and blizz,  but it's not like Blizzard was forced to use the modern server clients, they made their own choices and if a bunch of hobbyist managed to find a solution (again no matter how broken their set-up was, badly secured, populated or entirely different from Blizzards) it's strange that Blizzard can't?
---
Save yourself a lot of pain and spec daggers. Swords might be the best on paper, but in practice it makes gearing up a nightmare.
---
No one wants Distracting Dagger and Mugger's Belt except for Rogues, plus they drop in 5-man dungeons (as opposed to 10-mans). Just make sure you're the only Rogue and they're yours. Heartseeker is crafted so you can work on that at your own pace.
---
Awesome. Going to try and duo this with a warlock and spriest.

That’s not what nochanges meant. You clearly didn’t understand.

It meant preserve gameplay and mechanics as they were without opening the door to “improvements” that may have unforseeable effects (e.g. LFR, flying mounts). It didn’t mean don’t fix known bugs or hardware issues.

TBC was my fav version of WoW so it's not worst for me. I'm looking forward to it.
---
Eh, I knew what I was getting into when I rushed but on the opposite side people knew what could happen if they creep along. Neither side is right or wrong, people somehow complained about DM being released early, people are going to complain no matter what they do but I think they stand a better chance of pleasing more people by releasing more content. If people are just now hitting 60 having more raids and BGs waiting for them is far from a bad thing.

I hadn’t even remotely entertained the notion of subbing wow since early TBC.

I honestly didn’t even know/care it was still being updated.

Please?
---
In real vanilla people didn't know what they were getting and in real vanilla a LOT less progress was made by a LOT less people. There also weren't really any other alternatives, there are plenty now. I agree people will come back when it is released but I think it would be better for the general population to get the massive influx of content from P3 sooner, especially since the entire talk is about possibly delaying P3 so that people can enjoy a couple months of getting ganked when they land on their flight paths with less lag, it really just isn't worth the trade off.
---
I work 2-11. I don't sleep long. I have 2 days off and on those two days people do not generally raid at those times. I've done a few pugs and they're nightmares.

Can someone please explain why being 60 before phase 2 release is so important? I'm new and not sure the impact. I'm currently 45. If I don't get to 60 by then, how does it affect me? I'm a casual player. May raid with guild but not hardcore anything. Will it matter to me? 
---
I appreciate any info
---
If people are casuals they are the last people who should care if content is released fast.
---
I wish.
---
druid main.
---
4 mcs and 4 Onys
---
1 piece of druid gear. shit does not drop
---
not xander but pog
---
It is because you're bringing less dps and less healing. You should try understanding the meaning of 'gimp'.
---
Unless you’re looking to purposefully abuse the network I don’t see how this is an opinionated question
---
Yet I constantly see warriors need on it. I've seen muggers belt drop and a Warrior needed. I've had daggers drop and warriors typically roll. Warriors always say daggers are the way to go. I'm not sure if its but, they say it is .
---
It's the healcomm addon and have a good intuition of who's gonna get healed first. 
---
Generally you have half a second to pick who you're healing I'd everyone else is flash healing. 
---
1.5 seconds on their target and then another 1.5 seconds on your potential target. Heal is 2.5 seconds. I have logs where I'm middle of the pack healing with heals and greater heals with the lowest overhealing by a mile
---
Because the bootlegs are fucking emulators doing half the work of the real servers. Sorry you fail to understand that.
---
If you factor in mana regen and the 5 second rule then for the same HPS value using GHeal rank 4 will in many cases be the the most efficient way to heal BY FAR, but it's simply unrealistic to do in raids since rarely will you be able to heal \~2500 without either a lot of overheal or the risk of the target ending up dead. Pulling it off on the tank would require all healers to play perfectly.
---
In 5mans healing the tank with GHeal rank 3 or 4 is the best thing you can do though. It's like 2 times as efficient as Heal since you drop out of the 5 second rule between casts.
---
Edit: That being said, by factoring in regen your HPM values are actually higher than what you wrote too. My Heal rank 3 has 6.49 HPM with an effective cost of 182.7 having 583 +heal, GHeal rank 1 has an HPM of 5.65. If the goal is 250 HPS though, then GHeal rank 1 goes up to 8.85 HPM, while Heal rank 3 only goes up to 7.81, GHeal rank 4 even has 12.26 in that case.
---
Edit: Better wording.
---
Are you stupid? 
---
1. Why would I give you any sources when you haven't given me any? I'm not the one claiming that private servers are better.
---
2. If private servers are better, the why is classic successful?
---
3. Why the fuck do you need a source that wow is 15/month? It's been that way since launch. Are you playing for free somehow on actual severs?  
---
I don't know why I'm even feeding this troll.
---
Hmmm. perfect. thankyou. I emailed a distributor and we'll see how that goes. i really want one. I'll probably take the same thing. I'm not too fussed about the shiny buttons. Just the setup. Freestyle pro or freestyle edge. I have read of people getting the freestyle 2 (gel touch keys. not mechanical) and having strips of keys failing after 6-12 months. So i doubt I'll go that option.
---
p.s. nice cat.
---
nope Majority want Classic +. many would enjoy BC but most would disappear if it goes to that expansion.
---
Hes trying
---
Play. Another. Game.
---
I don’t get why some people on this sub want their life to revolve around WoW
---
Yeah I would defiantly be the person to do that lol. Funny how different of a game WoW is
---
the Freestyle Edge is basically exactly the same as the Freestyle Pro, right?
---
That's fair. I'm in the middle personally with alts 
---
I still dont have a 60. But hes 53 and definitely my main.
---
Then I have a 29. A 25. A 22. another 22. An 18 and a 14.
---
I've spent a good amount of time on the 29 as I'm twinking it. The 25 is the replacement for the 29 that got stupid luck in SFK (BoP not BoE).
---
And I just like switching it up.
---
Also,it helps I like dungeon running. And horde hasso many low level dungeons.
---
Whenever i get above RFK i usually find myself making another alt for RFC/(less WC)/SFK.
---
I love those 3 (2)dungeons!
---
This is false. The level of the zone only influences the type of fish you can catch there and the chance of a succesful catch. You can level 1-300 sitting in the starting zone.
---
k I’ve never played WOW wtf is going on
---
Our MC run takes under 2 hours and I get priority on loot because I’m one of the best performers but ok mate
---
“Tryhard” when it’s Classic which is designed to reward those who invest time and energy into their character?
---
If you want to stand a chance of enjoying pvp you will spend that on consumables for that alone
---
Holy fucking shit what the fuck is this subreddit
---
I hope OP is not a real person, for their sake
---
That’s not remotely true there are very few &lt; end game still leveling. It’s difficult to even get a group at lower levels now
---
Just do dungeons until 60
---
why would you (need) transfer to some other server when you have:  
---
a) instant ques
---
b) full gear
---
c) best community you could get for shotcall/tactics to play with everytime
---
You have zero proof of anything BC was great and wow at its finest in most people’s eyes.  Classic + would be neat but don’t discount the majorities love of BC
---
Why would people who are playing at a relaxed pace care about more content being available when they finally hit 60?
---
Any side can just say this.
---
Means nothing.
---
Just like your comment.  Bye
---
Yeah the amount of blizzard shill posts today has been truly mind blowing
---
If you have 4 people doing HoJ runs for HoJ only, people will almost definitely leave after getting it. I assume they are doing the quick bosses(arena etc) on the way
---
Because Blizzard kept shutting them down, really makes you think... That they did a ton of things better with little to no money, while under threat from Blizzard.
---
Probably getting ready for a new entry in the Starcraft franchise, but it's nowhere near ready to show. The rumor a few months ago was that they gave a Starcraft FPS another go but ended up cancelling it, which would explain why they seem especially quiet there.
---
That's a real reach.
---
Thank you fellas...
---
I suggest doing a bit of research on good BoE Blues. There's good ones out there which although not as good as what's BiS is not far off. The auction house has a 100% drop rate. Should help you replace your greens. :D
---
&gt;  2h fury has much higher burst 
---
WAT
---
It's sarcasm because this whole post is based on a dumb premise. Nobody does "just" angerforge runs with HoJ reserved. Arena/anger runs are how I got my friend his HoJ.
---
In that instance of course! Go do your rogue shit!
---
Now when I skull a caster and you go to the melee, or the FURTHER AWAY caster (meaning you might pull more mobs) that's the issue.
---
I've had many rogues go too far because of the caster mob.
---
I didnt los as I was planning on charging it afterwards and pulling the next wave of mobs as we kill the caster and keep my rage pooled.
---
Now the dps is AHEAD of me and if mobs get pulled to him AND the healer I now have to run in 2 different directions. Back to the healer and then forward to help you.
---
When the rogue knows when and what to do;its great.
---
When the rogue THINKS he knows the dungeon more than I do and hence he  needs to lead and choose how fast we go, now we have problems.
---
Here’s what I saw:
---
Blah blah blah wall of bullshit tryna tell me how to play blah blah blah
---
Yes. The benefit of hemo is it's very low energy cost. It does less damage than sinister, but it builds combo points faster and Sub is all about finishers.
---
Gandling represent! I played with that a day ago lol
---
Did you just pick up poop?
---
We all know what the code looks like, no need to bullshit that. Spaghetti.
---
They would have to rebuild those from scratch just like they did Classic, Classic+ keeps an entirely playerbase satisfied with less effort without having to split the playerbase again and increasing their workload again.
---
quartermaster cant really be solod easily without pulling one or more packs from that room.
---
I was wondering how I could see some people's talents. Thanks for the info!
---
It doesn't matter if there's a higher reward. You're making yourself weaker, which is gimping.
---
Or he could get Counterattack Lodestone which has 2 more AP.
---
Menethil to Dustwallow Marsh then out to Barrens. Do NOT go to Darnassus for this
---
According to you.
---
You’ve completely missed the point.
---
His point was that the server *trusts* what the client says it’s doing, and doesn’t verify, saving compute cycles.
---
The WoW client knows whether you are in range to cast a spell, and so does the server, but the server could choose not to verify this at cast time, meaning that an unmodified client would behave correctly but a hacked client could get away with lying about being in range, and the player could cheat with nothing to stop it.
---
I don’t know if this is the case or not, but that’s what the other user was arguing.
---
Ah, misundestood you. I don't really know how it worked out on pservers, but I know people that are going to do it in classic , first two or so weeks people will just try to figure out bracket sizes, because it's impossible to plan if you don't even know how many people can get the highest rank at once. From there they'll probably start stacking.
---
They're going for like 14h/day, I got a job so I can't hope to compete with that. And unless they don't plan to release BGs in the next 3 months (which is very unlikely), nobody will even hit R14 through world pvp anyway.
---
Why not before? It gives more spell power. I don’t see a reason not to unless you go 3 piece t1.  I feel like I might be missing something here
---
A guy in my guild was showing me his teleport hack on the second week of classic. I have no idea how it works but it took 2 or 3 dc's and he showed up to me in Un'goro on a level 1. He also has demon hunter jump working in classic, just infinite jumps. He doesn't get DC'd or anything doing that though. I have no idea how it works if they have "validations of everything" but their checks are obviously flawed somewhere anyway.
---
Hahaha as did many. I was a die hard console guy, swore by it my whole life except I loooved StarCraft and broodwar. 
---
 The whole entire reason I purchased a computer was to play sc2 since me mom's computer couldn't handle it lol which was all I had growing up. I had just bought a house and was in absolute no financial situation to spend 10$ nevermind 1000$ on a decent rig but there I was lol opened a line of credit just so I could play sc2. It was my life for the next 4 years. Now that's 7? Years ago haha.
---
Based on that, it's certainly possible that *current* subs doubled (or more, depending on how low BfA's lowest point got), but it's extraordinarily unlikely that it hit double the historical high point.
---
Augusteiner is the shit
---
Uh? No?
---
Faerie fire stops the rogue from going stealth again. As soon as the duel starts go into bear. It mitigates most of their burst. Once they're out you FFF and they cant re stealth.
---
Charge them to root them and back off. Cast the entangling roots spell on yourself if he gets close again. And just range him down.
---
His evasion means nothing to me. I'll moonfire him HoT myself and go back into bear form.
---
Demo roar also brings them out of stealth. And overpower is on a 10sec CD. One overpower for their evasion buff.
---
Warriors have a much harder time vs rogues than druids. A good rogue will just bleed out a warrior and run. They cant do that to a druid.
---
Yes please
---
#nochanges
---
I'm assuming you are playing swords. I believe you can get a 4/5 point kidney off if you time gouge properly with the expiration of cheap shot. Then you can thistle tea up to a 5 point eviscerate. You wont always have blind and vanish on CD so you have to control combat depending on the class.
---
Keep it.
---
It's the vanilla experience  lol
---
Because the honor system is releasing with phase 2, but there are no battlegrounds. The only way to get honor and rank up, is wPvP. LvL 60s will receive honor from killing players in the low 50s, so those leveling zones are gonna get ganked like crazy
---
They want it for the gold
---
Even newer versions of wow chant handle huge pvp. 
---
Every time the ashran weekend event thing is up it's a laggy shitshow
---
It has nothing to do with the engine, the server software on Blizzard's end is totally different than what a private server runs. It has a bunch of middleware and does a lot more stuff behind the scenes than what a pserver created by reverse engineering packets does.
---
Forgot the n1 reason orc warriors are op:
---
Extra axe skill :)
---
I know somewhat of what I'm talking about. I know if they upgraded server hardware, mainly ram it would probably reduce lag quite a bit. I know alot of it is used up by NPC AI and instances (dungeons and raids) but I think if they would upgrade some server ram and memory this problem might go away and I dont see it as being super expensive. 
---
Trust me the blizzard we all once loved has died. Almost all of the lead devs of old are gone. Blizzard is now Activison, just with a different name. We need to bring up our issues with the game aggressively or nothing will be fixed.
---
You work 2-11 but you manage to run UBRS 10x in a day, let alone time finding the members at those off-hours and sleep aswell.
---
Yeah, I call bullshit.
---
Takes 2-3 hours in PUG clearing MC
---
ZPerl
---
Because it would validate their personal opinions if they don't like the current state of the game.
---
Yes because I still haven't gotten a 2Her from Rag and will have no chance in PvP.
---
Thrash** Blade without a sliver of doubt. Go get it tonight. It is incredible, you will use it even at 60 until Dal Rends or something else
---
Would rather have dynamic tickrate than minute long game freezes.
---
You're not paying for the class; you're paying for the skill and availability.
---
I appreciate ya, that was satisfying...
---
Thrash mainhand, anything you want offhand does not matter that much if its at level for a level 50.
---
Somehow I'm still going to fuck this up though.
---
Typical moron to read a comment and assume I mean just a generic pvp kill when I am clearly specifying a scenario he is saying he wants to do. 
---
If he denies someone any access to the game by killing them to the point that the game is unplayable that is bannable and has been bannable for years even on PVP servers. There is a reason why Gms will contact spawn killers who corpse camp because its a denial of service and is completly bannable. 
---
Im not whining about it because im on EU so you spergs can enjoy licking asmongs asshole all you want. I am saying that what he is saying he wants to do is against the rules. If your low IQ brain can process this then you would understand.

/who is only online. And people quit they makes alts they switch servers etc etc.

People like to bitch. People are bitching.

I get killed no matter what server or faction I play.

I'm not sure it actually makes my mount faster.

You go back to pvp gear when you break 3 piece bloodvine set bonus.

I absolutely love that this post has an abstract, intro, methods, and discussion. In fact, upon writing this message, I almost typed "paper" instead of "post." &lt;3
---
I'll have you know my shirt is *navy* blue...
---
HoJ does proc in animal form
---
pouring money on an issue doesn't fix it
---
Because they're game designers that should pride themselves on making new, visionary, enticing content. 
---
Blizzard right now is like the shittiest aspect of Hollywood being a re-boot culture or doesn't dish out any money to visionary storytellers. They play everything safe for global audiences. The metaphor isn't even a metaphor. It's the truth about all big name entertainment at this point. 
---
They play it safe with turds like JJ Abrams (he's basically an expensive cover band) or Marvel trash for 8 year old adults.
---
"Why is our culture so childish?" Reap what you sow.
---
Arms is better for group PvP purely because of the Mortal Strike debuff. You can still function as Fury - you will actually deal more damage than Arms Warriors - but you have to understand that you're missing your most important utility spell. Your group would be stronger if you were Arms.
---
Honestly i think the only thing that will "Fix" the servers is less people playing.
---
The underlining tone here is clearly you have no right to complain because you're not an Elite level IT expert and Blizzard knows everything, I have seen shit like this from fanboys for years, I know how you people function and think.
---
Anyway these problems have been going on with Blizzard servers for 5+ years, I was playing retail during the time they moved from proper dedicated servers to cheap Cloud garbage, this obviously caused gigantic performance issues and 100's of pages of complaining on the forums, so in an effort to fix it they then introduced Sharding as an attempt to cover up the glaring holes in their poor server hardware but obviously this doesn't work with classic since it's an open world MMO so here we are, in late 2019 dealing with the same bullshit people on retail have been dealing with for years.
---
Go and read the amount of players who got banned from corpse camping then come back to me. Someone clearly needs to understand rules on wow a bit better huh kiddo? :)
---
No... they didn't... that shit costs tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars per month...
---
Edit: words
---
I use Thrash Blade on my 53 prot pally for single target fights, it's dope
---
we don't know.
---
I sincerely doubt it is as simple as beefing up the servers. Most likely, it is a limitation of the engine itself (or more accurately, a fundamental limitation of the task itself). Chances are, the servers have to perform exponentially increasing tasks as the number of players in a zone increases. Consider something as simple as checking if one character is visible to another:
---
For each character (n) the server has to calculate if all *other* characters (n-1) in the zone are visible to the character:   
---
O = n(n-1)  
---
1 character in zone, 1x0, 0 checks required.  
---
2 characters in zone, 2x1, 2 checks required.  
---
3 characters in zone, 3x2, 6 checks required.  
---
4 characters in zone, 4x3, 12 checks required.  
---
5 characters in zone, 5x4, 20 checks required.  
---
6 characters in zone, 6x5, 30 checks required.  
---
25 characters in zone, 25x24, 600 checks required.  
---
26 characters in zone, 26x25, 650 checks required.  
---
50 characters in zone, 50x49, 2450 checks required.  
---
75 characters in zone, 75x74, 5550 checks required. 
---
And that's just calculating which characters are visible to which other characters. There are many more functions that scale in the same way. Brute force only gets you so far when the problem is exponential scaling of operations.
---
source?
---
Hmm, appears so.
---
This isn't an artistic opinion saying you prefer modern graphics over classic. This is like saying you prefer 30fps over 60fps
---
Removing the ‘green’ component makes a big difference to the comparison. A BWL epic was rewarded for weeks of raiding. A BC green was rewarded after 10 minutes of solo questing.
---
Yes, that is my opinion.
---
Agreed. Complaining is valid, though I doubt any improvements will be made.
---
&gt;  death-hop your way south down the road in STV
---
Best way to do this as a low level in my experience has actually been to go to the southwestern tip of Westfall and swim south. Just point yourself in the direction of Booty Bay, put on autorun, and go AFK. 0 corpse runs.
---
I want to lvl up my bow skill...it's gonna take forever as a war
---
/u/Hot_Slice is a fucking idiot
---
I'm not refreshing my subscription if this is what I get for 15$ a month.

I prefer input lag over frame lag. It is subjective. Don't be an idiot.
---
You don't understand shit man.  Get blizzards dick out of your mouth and stop being a fucking shill
---
If it's for the lock quest just get the boat to menethil then run to ratchet. Easy.
---
I believe crusader is PPM so it doesn't benefit from OH speed.

That's perfect

14 years ago I was altoholic as well, now I am not, only 3 alts: 33 lvl, 20 and 14 and my main is 60😂
---
edit: I have full time job and a wife, no kids tho, but really demanding cat 😼
---
Nah we were taking 5 minute break and I accidentally hit the scroll up on my mousewheel (bound to pet attack/hunters mark) while not even looking at the comp. Since I had Golemagg targeted, my pet went right for him and started attacking. Didn’t have game sounds on so didn’t hear my pet dash or anything. Noob mistake, for sure. I still catch shit when we get to him every week tho lol
---
Unlikely based on the wild TBC hypetrains of /wowservers
---
If you're leveling as arms spec, then after you get whirlwind, I often tanked in berserker stance. Just watch out, you're more fragile, and sweeping strikes makes you have no aoe threat issues, but single target you're still better off going into defensive stance and sundering up. Then use mortal strike and revenge as you have rage.
---
And you're correct, as you get higher level, you get less rage issues.
---
I found the guy in the picture.
---
I wonder if casting the hot itself generates a negligible amount of threat (similar to casting a buff on your tank)
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, Ghost was the first try, cancelled years ago. Some of the creative work, including Nova, was reused in SC2.
---
I would imagine Whitewizard would get a lot of KKK references....
---
Damn, there is a mirror in your room? That's unfortunate.
---
Us Westfall folks just want our World Bosses.  World PvP isn’t a thing here.
---
It's weird, our warlocks do quite well on dps. Brsting our mages typically.
---
Did you get your BT?
---
And a lot thought they did and they didn't.
---
Finding a group as rogue for mara has been a nightmare, now I worry if I do it all someone else will roll for it -_-
---
Alright, mara I go...
---
So you’d have to be careful.  If you use a macro/device to pop 1 macro that casts or attacks multiple boxes with 1 keystroke you could get banned.
---
Seriously tho you pAy $14.99/month x 20?
---
Which is hilarious, because Vanilla was around and thriving for a lot longer than 2 months before most of this phase 2 stuff was added. PvP didn't arrive until nearly 5 months after launch. Dire maul took 4 months.
---
People are so impatient nowadays. Everyone's obsessed with powering through the game so that they can demand more content. The cherry on top is that they want it *now*, but they want it bug-free.
---
If you're sick of Onyxia and MC, roll an alt. If that's not fun, go play another game for a bit. You'll only 'fall behind' if you're obsessed with 'staying ahead', both of which are imaginary terms in a game like Classic.
---
Gambling is bannable i would not suggest this these days.
---
I was checking out the trivia bot add on again and someone there mentioned a ban for gambling
---
The underlying thought here, comming from a non IT/CS guy, is quit fucking saying it's such an "easy fix". You don't need to apply this to the game apply this to anything in life, specifically if you held a skilled job. Then someone sees a problem and think it's so "easy to fix".
---
The game is 15 year old, just because the both hardware and software have advanced doesn't mean it magically work better in every aspect or there any new surface level problem with differencing deep level problems. That is the point.
---
no! it's a quest reward! all you have to do is kill Princess. you pick up the quest from Nijel's Point in Desolace from the centaur. it's a freebie! gogogogo
---
Who doesn't.
---
He’s gotta make a channel to pay fir 40 subs
---
Probably unpopular opinion, but I play both. I've been playing off and on since the days of Vanilla and took a break from retail shortly before MoP came out and didn't come back until shortly before Legion when they were doing that promotion for returning players.
---
I like Classic and retail ( to a point, I'm looking forward to seeing what Shadowlands will bring to the table since it seems Classic's success has made them re-evaluate the course of retail) and tend to switch between the two when I feel like it. I don't have as much time as I would like to dedicate to Classic (I work two jobs and the server I'm on is a different time zone than the one I'm in so it's hard to find dungeon groups) as I though I would. 
---
Right now, I'm just working on getting my retail main and alts to 120 ( haven't really played BfA so it's just to get ready for Shadowlands) before hopping back to Classic where I will likely reroll on a PvE server (unless server transfers become available) just so I can be more efficient with the time when I have the opportunity to play. 
---
TLDR: I like having the option of being switch between the two of them because it's nice having the the option to play Classic if I get bored of retail and vice versa so I'm not paying a sub for a game I'm not playing
---
Bibliography lmao
---
"And the foriegn kid just ate something off the carpet"
---
It's not personal experience, lol I thought you would be reasonable enough to agree 3.3 hours a day (which is what I originally said) for a extended period of time is a lot but I guess not.
---
Even if you assume every 60 has an alt, that's still 30%. You're not even close to a majority no matter how you want to fudge the numbers
---
More anecdotes, no one cares about your band
---
And then a bunch of assumptions. I have 10.5 days played. I know damn well I'm not a casual, but unlike you I can admit it. I hope you can too one day
---
You'd rather not be able to hit buttons for several seconds instead of having a stutter?
---
It absolutely did.
---
You can use the little bookmark thing at the top instead of commenting.
---
I find they are desirable now due to wanting banish in MC and everyone wants summons/healthstones/soulstones. There's not many on my server either. Quite a few times i've seen raids specifically chasing some locks
---
wellllll they also have different metabolic systems for fast twitch action.  A single, high burst of energy might be all the "cold blooded" dragon can muster but a warm blooded animal has no issue with sustained efforts.  It's all about dat ATP
---
Yes. Don't wanna get aoe farmed by lvl 60 mages.
---
20-30g is perfectly reasonable if you are A.) a good tank B.) Well geared.
---
No intestines; no poop. Of course, I did cannibalize a gnome earlier and now I have a bellyache....must have been something I ate.
---
Well thanks for your great photoshop skills! This was really low effort. I was just searching for some generic Bobby pics and I found your gem. And was just think he should have HoR instead before I saw your comment lol
---
If you can remove the security checks at load in exchange for speed, there's no reason to run them in the first place.
---
You either care about data validity or you don't. If it's not important enough to sacrifice performance at load it's not important enough to sacrifice performance at rest either.
---
It's like getting hacked. You don't get a big warning alarm that says 'YOU HAVE BEEN HACKED BE SCARED NOW'. It just happens and maybe you notice later when your dick pics are on a website. 
---
If they turned off the validation at load, they'd have zero way to verify since they just didn't record all that data they needed. So it's ok if people cheat and never get caught but only when we get some sick wpvp for compensation. 
---
Doesn't necessarily apply to wow classic servers, I don't know what kinds of checks they run. This is just general 'security doesn't work that way'. Who would play wow classic legitimate if blizzard publicly took that stance on cheating?
---
They were a little overzealous though.
---
There was tale after tale of low level horde players (usually hunters after an owl) entering Darnasus via the Rutherian village portal, dying to the guards before they could even render the first frame, and then getting instabanned.
---
Or locks fearing people off zepplins and the victim tripping the speed/flying hack detection and vanishing never to return.
---
I think Blizz probably errs on the side of caution. Cheating nowhere near as prevalent on classic servers compared to private servers, (since every ban evasion costs money, and players are generally from the same timezone as the gms). Why risk the bad PR of a wrongful ban when you've got a team of people who are paid to investigate, and logs which will exonerate or incriminate.
---
Honestly I read this and think "yeah that's fair maybe we don't know everything that's going on" and then I remember private servers existed and how smooth their servers were and get enraged and remember there is no possible way that a 60 billion dollar company gets out performed  by a couple of neets in their basement if the company was actually trying to deliver a quality product.
---
The days for excuses are over, it's 2019 and we want servers that can run an MMO properly, these servers exist and the community demands them.
---
That awesome battle was the battle in Felwood with the Org raid following afterwards right? Hands down my most epic wow pvp event, and it was riddled with lag. Imagine if it was even just half as bad how amazing it could be
---
Some people think if you play more than 30 minutes a day you're an addict.
---
I can guarantee you that most people who aren't 60 by now didn't get it because they're bad at leveling and not because they didn't play enough, so they like to use that excuse a lot.
---
&gt; Usual **DPS** raid compilation
---
or create a black hole...
---
They are updating MP lots so I guess. But I was honestly hoping for some new content. It's been awhile I feel. 4 years?  But with D4 coming in 2030 I guess I can wait lol. Hopefully not dying until 2070-2080ish so got some time ya know lol
---
Yeah classic+ is the long term solution here. BC would just be a short term money grab.
---
Description says it all, pal.
---
I mean, it's equally bad Alliance side.
---
Paladins are about as good at holding aggro as Shamans are at mitigation. That is to say, they both can't tank.
---
I meant in Vanilla. People frequently brought up how you'd need to CC stuff and manage threat, but most grps just burst stuff down or even AoE them and kite.
---
Yes from turnins
---
It's just going to be a bunch of account sharing, can't say i really care about it.
---
I just want the boots for Shaman to run faster in Ghost Wolf and then it's all whatever
---
No, I'm saying send the Eggs Benedict back cause the cook fucked it up. But don't make it sound like you know how to run a kitchen when mommy's made all your food for you.
---
I'm using the BaconReader app on my phone, which doesn't appear to have the bookmark function. Though it does have a Saved option, which means it'll be buried beneath a ton of other things I'll save and eventually get to. Maybe.
---
Commenting is just easier as I rarely do so I can refer back to it quickly. It also allowed me to publicly thank and recognize those who put the effort in to bring this issue to light, helping avoid complicating what is already a fairly confusing process.
---
It's going to be the same issue on any pvp server when p2 releases, not just Faerlina.
---
Rank 8 is a lot of time still. Rank 10 is pretty brutal too. Pretty much have to play every day for weeks
---
...wut? Explain?
---
Lotus is not 40 in skeram.
---
Oh! My innocent self didn't even think about that... Go with "Thank"
---
nice goodluck!
---
When I saw the level shrink to 60 this is exactly what I thought. They are clever. The timing and marketing of all this isn’t coincidence.
---
Are you high? I don't mind the graphics but they're not even close to modern standards
---
I get that, just the claim that it DIDN'T happen is silly. And I do agree an official word would be good.
---
It really isn't, something about the photo itself because my game does not look nothing like that.
---
As discussed in plenty of the other threads, private servers can do a lot of corner cutting to make things less laggy but less secure. Also I’d love to see the average number of active players on classic compared to the average number of active players on a private server.
---
No where does it say it doubled. Why are you intentionally lying? It also is talking about SUBS PER QUARTER. Not entire subs.
---
Once P2 hits no one going for rank will raid towns. They won’t risk the chance of a dishonourable kill when someone in the groups kills an enemy npc
---
No idea what I'm looking at
---
She really does :)
---
I've been playing on a laptop from early 2010s with an APU and am able to hit 60+ FPS everywhere, it's INSANELY easy to run.
---
I'm just drinking in the deliciousness that is the idea that a lot of the sweaty, no life players will probably quit. I would be just fine playing with half the population if that means that the infantile attitudes and the "Pvp is life" zealots go ahead and fade away to another game to bother the rational folk no longer.
---
Spec into soc and holy with improved ret aura and just whittle them down and hard cast holy light or flash of light if need be. It’s pretty slow but paladins can solo a lot
---
Beef handles beef
---
It's a little girl that thankfully only pisses on one spot in the bathroom, uff
---
I quit in the first few months of MoP. I haven't played retail since. Classic is the only reason I resubscribed.
---
Hunters are underrepresented in my guild too, 3 raid groups and only maybe 4-5 hunters between them all. I think they may be more popular on Alliance than Horde.
---
I think this point is a bit irrelevant now though because I'm sure we are gonna see the vast majority of the player base by the time Nax is out skip BWL and MC entirely and just raid Nax and then hit the early raids if they have time. 
---
I also don't think it's realistic in retail anymore because you would basically need to replace the multi difficulties of raids with 1 difficulty which I think kills off an enormous part of the raiding scene right now. Mythic is way too hard to be that one difficulty and if you lose it I think majority of serious raiders just quit the game.
---
37 year old with two kids. I've been 60 for a couple weeks. It did take a lot of time, but most of it after the kids went to sleep.
---
TY anonymous Silver!
---
...what
---
Who is?
---
didn't ret become "usable" at around [patch 2.3](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.3.0)? it was still pretty weak compared to other DPS classes, but I seem to remember a few rets appearing in the ladders, mostly in 3v3. (arms - ret - resto shaman, maybe?)
---
props to you btw for getting gladiator with a ret, I've loved that class, but they were in a dire state in TBC. having played both them and shadow priests (aka the other support DPS class), the difference was just... jarring.
---
Cause neets have literally one job and a sole purpose in life. I haven't played any of the vanilla servers but from what I understand there are other issues and different work around that aren't exactly pristine ether. 
---
Because it's a 60billion dollar company I highly doubt they focus on this one particular issue. And no, open world PvP isn't as important as it is to as many people as you think. It falls somewhere in low minority category. People just love the idea of it, not many do.
---
Spoken like a true paladin
---
I remember doing this year's ago during both vanilla and tbc, its to do with the order you "equip" the weapons, from memory it was something like having two one handers on and then ctrl clicking a two hander, and it would leave the offhand in place. Or something along those lines.
---
Thanks, would help a ton &lt;3
---
F
---
No because i want phase 3 the most and that would delay it alot
---
I've been in guilds where the GL was a tank, some where healer.. I was even in one that the GL didn't even raid but the officers ran everything. RL though, is almost always MT imho.
---
I do. He makes some good points. Activision-B has a lousy track record for about a decade now —especially with WoW.
---
I think Blizz see the long term as attempting to make shadowlands palatable to the classic crowd so they can focus on one game.
---
But like, right now, it’s better than omnicast+hands of power too right?
---
I largely agree but it seems that is how blizz are positioning this xpac.
---
I hope they do both, I don't see why they couldn't. I really wanna play BC again, even wotlk.
---
KEEP YOUR CRACK ON THE GROUND
---
Is it not 14 out of 15? Y forgot the important digit 0 Edit: No you are right, the zero is taken in concideration. I'm only thinking in binary
---
Why don’t you make your own group and choose who you invite?
---
Also, thrashblade is a quest reward. You won’t have to roll against anyone
---
Yeah just fix the servers and give people time.
---
Minus the glasses I used to look like that, it really isn't a good life to live.
---
On a more serious note, if anyone wants to make a change the grass is 100% greener on the otherside.
---
Check out /r/loseit
---
&gt; Imagine being such a blizzard shill that you are comparing a modern game to something 15 fucking years ago
---
How dare these people compare the game to exactly what it's emulating.
---
Dont be one of them.
---
Everyone in this thread bitching about horde favoritism.  Alliance have a huge advantage in world pvp due to blizzards toasters, I mean servers, lagging so hard you can't get abilities off.  Just have all your pallies drop consecration and you win the lagfest that is world pvp.
---
HOJ does way more damage than Lodestone. You can also get double procs off claw/maul. It’s not even close which one is better.
---
people on Reddit would just complain about something else until the game goes back to being retail.
---
The coffers are not past the bar.
---
I got about 20 clears of strat no cloak 15 strat no chest
---
If there was a lot of people (and lag) that maybe could have caused this.
---
I'd say wait on switching.
---
Even at 60, a 30/0/21 spec is perfectly capable of healing 5-man. This allows you to occupy either dps or healer roles to collect gear. Moreover, since so much of Resto Shaman pre-raid BiS is either mail or leather, you often don't have any competition from the healer in your group for healing gear.
---
Even in raids, a 30/0/21 is fairly strong. You're not going to be able to match what a deep Resto build can do, but you're going to be within the normal variations of gear for the purposes of Chain Heal.
---
oh you’re right, they’re across the gap. the coffers are past all the golems when you do “lava runs”
---
Just doing rolls in ubrs, it's not that serious but that warrior is friends with some others in the guild so he's not going anywhere
---
As someone who isn't 60....for sure yes lol. I'd get to 60 and maybe even start leveling my other toons up a bit as well. I don't think Phase 1 has been long enough yet.
---
This makes me sad :(
---
53 soon to be 54 checkin in as well.
---
Is this what happens when you play wow and take adderall?
---
Ah yeah, so its just different for rgb keyboard. Pads look nicer. I've got the one with blue lighting.
---
Got the same issue.
---
&gt; When has blizzard every shown actions to support world pvp in any way?
---
Creating world bosses alone is indication that it's expected.  Maybe they don't nurture it the same way they do the rest of their content, but there's absolutely a culpability on them to ensure it works.
---
Ya it became decent around there, until you ran into RMP's with a priest that knew to mana burn me twice :).  In the pre-WotLK patch during S4 was when it got completely busted strong and everyone who tried could get glad on it.  
---
Arms/Ret/Rsham was decent up to ~2k, cheesing people with WF.  After that RDruid got a lot better with consistent pressure + a crazy CC chain.  Rsham was too vulnerable to RMP's to do great at that level.
---
Edge is for gaming, you probably get better features. For example NKRO.
---
Sorry let me rephrase.
---
You admitted you didn't know what you were talking about but gave your opinion, couched in the comment below that you were probably mistaken. 
---
I am clarifying that you are, and as to why. 
---
Smart? No but involved in the field of which you admittedly are armchairing over. Sorry to jot contribute to the echo chamber you wanted.
---
Honestly think AV is easier than Argent Dawn!  On AV weekend you can do it in like 12 hours with a decent group. But I see what you mean now.
---
I was told if your server doesn't have 50+ guilds in MC you're a failure. 
---
Congrats non-neckbeard.
---
No, I am, cause ACTUALLY he's comparing apples and oranges just like 90% of the rest of the subreddit shooting off at the mouth about shit they know nothing about
---
&gt; In TBC especially, raid gear was insanely strong.
---
...for a few select classes, and even then, not always. 
---
PVE geared rogues with glaives could be scary for a few comps, but they were made out of paper -  moment they lost control, you could just run them over. the only thing I can distinctly remember being good for almost every were the ZA trinkets, but other than then, for PVP the general rule was "wear pvp gear or get splattered".
---
There’s a special place in hell for these kinds of people.
---
Even got the pug in for a family photo. Gz man. I legit feel accomplished for you. There's nothing better.
---
Honestly as a dev they probably didnt consider this use case.  I'm guessing they left in old shitty code which doesnt scale.
---
Tactical mastery 
---
Playing without it is honestly the worst
---
Seriously — I played HOTS before coming back to WoW and people would similarly complain about broken parts of the game (HOTS is built off sc2 engine). The fact of the matter is, even if it’s technically possible to solve these issues, when you and your 5 dev team have to prioritize rebuilding core parts of the engine which will likely introduce tons of regressions vs more manageable bugfixes or improvements, it isn’t even a question. People drastically misjudge how hard it is to change some things and how few devs there likely are. The only people that actually know the root causes of the issues and estimates of how to fix them are the devs on the team.
---
— also also a developer
---
Don’t ban, boot then flag for human observation.
---
Keep booting for triggering detection. A once in a blue moon “zep fear” wouldn’t be hard to see on the logs, and one boot isn’t a huge “game killer”

and I think horde alliance ratios are roughly even. Definitely not lopsided like other servers.
---
How do you plan on AOE grinding dungeons without pulling aggro all the time? Do a dungeon cleave build instead. It’s very similar to an AOE build. You’ll be more useful in the dungeon, you might do less damage marginally but you’ll cause fewer wipes. Don’t blizzard 2 mobs, or even 3 most of the time, just frost bolt, cone of cold, and fireblast.

Because back in actual Vanilla WoW, people didn't know the ins and outs of everything. Engineering was a very expensive profession that didn't make people money, doubt most people even used it for BG's until TBC when arena came about.
---
One of those "insider" blog posts (that could be made up but has enough truth to be believable) suggested that toward the end of Classic, players will have the option to migrate their character to a retail server.  I think it also suggested some other goodies transferring over, so you'd get some benefit if you played through classic or did Naxx (maybe if you have T3 in Classic you'll get the transmog on retail? I don't see it working like that exactly though).
---
First try very nice.
---
We killed him at 2:30 last run
---
As someone who actually played vanilla, wpvp is being wildly over glorified, it wasn't as awesome as people are claiming it will be.
---
We already know that massive wpvp battles in Classic will just be aoe spams, and that will be just as boring with lag as it would without it.
---
I just want my fucking key ring, bring phase 2 out already.
---
You and I both know that behavior of the raid during raid time isn't the obnoxious bit. 
---
I'd sooner deal with that drunk raid lead than some neet whose life revolves around his raider.io score and parse percentiles. I just don't see a place for that in this old content. Been there, done that.  Too old for that shit. 
---
Just my personal preference.
---
Retail already appeals well to a variety of audiences: hardcore raiders, competitive PvP players, mount/transmog collectors, achievement hunters, dungeon speed-runners, etc.
---
I don't know how or if they'll succeed in adding the classic audience(s) to that mix but it's hardly impossible for a game to appeal to multiple audiences.
---
Yeah. Us having a good game goes against everything he believes in.   
---
If he could port us over to shadowlands and shutter classic he would.
---
where will the data be displayed for reference?
---
Warrior Main Tank, raiding 5 weeks now.
---
No raid gear. Only thing I've gotten was Only Head.
---
dude im wondering the same things every time I visit this sub.  PPl get a compliment or whatever and suddenly its time to post on reddit what a wonderful gaminb community and aventure it had been.. Zzz
---
Crit! As a hunter I don't look at parse % since a couple crits makes a huge difference, I look at aimed shots and multi shots over the duration of the fight to see how much dps was lost on not using an ability on CD
---
Join LookingForGroup channel if you haven’t done it yet. People are hardly ever grouping up inside a dungeon. They look for mates outside (usually idling in Stormwind/Ironforge) and only after the group is complete do they depart to the dungeon.
---
    /run for i=1, GetNumGroupMembers() do local token = "raid"..i local guid = UnitGUID(token) if guid and 1&lt; 2 then print(GetUnitName(token)) end end
---
This uses a slightly different API call that just gets the unit name rather than trying to also obtain their server on classic.  It'll keep you from getting the Nil at the end of some names.
---
I mean, other servers had it fixed.
---
fuck that buff entirely. i tried playing on \*pserver\* and it was always some cock gargling gigavirgin sitting around any low level area that auto flags pvp waiting to kill you.  
---
you go from getting online for the day getting that amazing buff to landing at the flight path dying and rage logging out.
---
As long as rankers exist so will world PVP. It's not like BRM etc would suddenly stop being PVP hotzones with the introduction of BGs.
---
It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.

Generally 11 keys per run, so 55 per hour.

All results will be linked back here and in a separate post.

Fuck yes I think it’s coming out too early to begin with
---
&gt;It's ridiculous in 2019 you can't figure this out.

As an IT worker I fucking dread this shit. YOU figure it out then. Shits harder than it seems even with trained professionals :/
---
Sadly were playing Classic+ with the retail engine.
---
That 2 set is hard to beat, though the shoulders are better to use for it than the hands.
---
??????
---
Which part did you not understand? Explain and I can hold your hand through it little one.
---
...Did we? I remember 2 seperate 80v80-100v100 battles that seemed perfectly fine...
---
Well everything carries over. I think the meme is there going to charge 40$ for a UI update lol. 
---
 Hoping the PVE is decent. I played OW for dam near three years before discovering wow. I had planned to play with the wife but as soon as she found out that it's a paid sub it was a hard no lol
---
&gt; couldn't we as a server agree to only kill like 1 person a week then all be in the top percent?
---
No.  That would be literally impossible, assuming a pvp server.  People will try to control raid and dungeon entrances.  Even high level quest hubs.  Nobody will agree to cooperate if they have the opportunity to lock down the other faction, and they will.  
---
That's predicated on the idea that it's even possible on a technical level, which I doubt.  There's probably hard limits on the number of people allowed into a bracket.  Maybe that would result in a pure lottery?  Which would further incentivize people to do better than others they know they can out rank.
---
I’d say selling for 650-700 is acceptable.
---
They did the right thing. Your post is idiotic.
---
Okay boomer
---
Lurker ring for Resto Druids, Warlock class trinket, DPS trinkets, Sunwell cloak/neck/rings for all classes (which were higher item level than their respective PvP counterparts, leading to more overall stats)... Raid gear was a huge advantage in TBC.
---
In 5 days.
---
44 is half way for XP. You also have to consider you get more XP for quests the higher you get. So I don't believe 44 is "half way".
---
How do you believe it will be in 2 months? How about in 3 months? It took our guild 3 weeks to clear MC. It will most likely take 2 months for MC to just be a boring routine weekly dungeon.
---
I’ve never seen it before but nothing in Classic surprises me anymore.
---
&gt; I don't want blizzard delaying content so that some fringe people who want to play 40v40 regularly can enjoy it. This thread asked for opinions. You're entitled to be dismissive of mine all you want. World pvp is going to be a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things as it will be nonexistent when battlegrounds come out. Delaying phase 2 (and therefore phase 3) just to fix this issue would be a huge misstep.
---
You are simply wrong about this. The reason why we have classic wow servers is unarguably because of the undeniable popularity of private servers*.  The literal best classic wow guild in the entire world (world first ony/rag) based their entire guilds races for mass world pvp. Just because you and your friends don't care about it, doesn't not make it the most attractive part of classic for most players (and the best players). I guarantee you that if world pvp stays the lag-fest BS that is, all of the game's best players will leave for next private server experience.
---
But we all know the main difference is cross server stuff. And Blizzard has proven extremely unwilling to commit to actual server merges. 
---
The situation has now peaked with FUCKING HUNDREDS of boost groups being the only thing I see in trade anymore. Until single server is a thing again classic and retail are just incompatible at a fundamental level. 
---
Which is a shame, because classic pve sucks.
---
Would have
---
I wish we could find a mage more. We have 6 mages in our raid. We have way too many melees.
---
I like how you used "you people" at the end. Made it for me.
---
I didn't, makes sense. I can imagine a true overwatch 2 would cause riots in the proverbial streets. They'd essentially be burning the only demographic keeping the game raking in swathes of cash which seems like it'd be an insanely stupid decision.
---
This statement is a lie.
---
Thank you! It honestly wasn’t all that clear in the guide I found.
---
"Homo."
---
Got em good!
---
It's pretty fair to assume no one wants lag and that with years to prepare this issue would have been addressed.
---
why the fuck does my server still have layers if it's dropping down quickly?
---
I mean, upgrade is an upgrade, my dude.

There are lots of world drops with higher + frost damage than the hat's spell power. Just keep an eye on the AH and buy them when they're posted, I'm wearing a lvl 52 +33 sp green

If my grandmother had wheels, she would have been a bike.

Yea it's just a little counter-intuitive.

Finishing a test earlier is simply because you're good. Yeah other things can be considered gimping as well as long as you're making yourself weaker. But those aren't relevant. I don't know why you find such a simple concept so hard to understand.
---
Big diff between subbing and shelling out 60 for an expac.
---
In fact I'll do the math. 3 million for an expansion  would be matched by over 12 million resubs. And blizzard have said that expac money is what keeps wow profitable.
---
Resubs alone only prove they need to turn it into a way to entice people to buy shadowlands.
---
Look, we have a professional coder and system administrator giving their opinion!
---
You should give us the option on the last question to specify that we're not excited because we don't think the servers can handle it.
---
200 runs of SFK and neither an assassin’s blade  nor a shadowfang have dropped

I definitely understand  the frustration

Yeah it's nasty against rogues and warriors but you win those matchups anyway by not being a mouthbreather

I played retail BFA in an Alliance mythic raiding guild. Our goal was pushing CE but we never quite made it. We transferred off our dead as hell realm onto Stormrage and despite having to essentially start fresh we hit the ground running and went 7/8 Uldir with only a couple weeks until the next patch and decided against killing ourselves to learn G'huun phase 1, unfortunately. We got Mekkatorque sub 20% in BoD and the roster boss put an end to our dreams. Our core raiders just didn't want to log in anymore and recruiting took an ungodly amount of effort yet we couldn't fill ranks. You could feel that interest in WoW across the board had been in steady decline for all of BFA and we were really feeling it now. People who actually enjoy content with some challenge were drying up in the BFA climate and us being Alliance essentially means we feel the brunt of the shrinkage.
---
During much of this hiatus where we couldn't raid, I dabbled with twinking and eventually got really deep into 110/1 DH twinking and level boosting. This will sound stupid, but it was the most fun I had had this expansion overall and also opened me up into doing some WoW economy/goblining on the side. Long story short, Blizz decided to kill twinking. So I guess fuck me, right?
---
Guild did come back together after hiatus and start pushing mythic EP. We made it to the early Ashvane wall and our surprisingly optimistic spirits crushed pretty quickly and we just gave up after like 2 raid days without 20 people active. Now I don't really see us ever rebuilding. Discord is silent, as well as guild chat.
---
I still did want to see the 8.3 raid as some of the fights look great. I wanted a fresh start on Horde this time and what is nice about the seasonal system to patches is this shoulda been a pretty easy thing to get going. Then I saw the details for what they had planned for the corruption mechanic. I know we still have plenty of time on the PTR but the fact that they released corruption mechanic details littered with RNG just makes me sick. Call me melodramatic all you want but this is offensive after all the feedback they've received. What's even stranger is how their Shadowlands reveal seemed to be drenched in acknowledgement of the feedback and the keywords they seemed to have forgotten. To add to the frustration, I also realized were I to try to get one of my capped Horde toons ready for 8.3, it looks like I'd have to grind essences again. They apparently confirmed there will be no system to account wide share essences in any form. So I will not be playing retail WoW until Shadowlands beta at the absolute earliest.
---
I'm sick of the essentially required daily chores to keep a toon current for performance. My god, islands. What a colossal failure. Content designed for mount, pet and appearance collectors that is also the most time efficient way to power level AP for your stupid neck. It's been years since I gave any shit about how my character looks since it has lost any meaning it ever had from early WoW. I purposely do not transmog my gear and only use vanilla faction mounts and TBC grphyons. That's how you stand out nowadays in a sea of people dressed in full sets from 2 expansions ago: you wear a clownsuit.
---
I raid log in Classic and enjoy the time I spend with my raid. Yes, the raids are piss easy, but I still enjoy shooting the shit with everyone. When I log in off raid days, I enjoy helping people on alts, doing guild pvp events or farming open world or DM in guild groups. I can do whatever I want and do not feel like if I don't follow Blizz's chore list I'm falling behind on their stupid treadmill. Been leveling alts because I love leveling, love the sense of accomplishment and love seeing how much the classes have evolved or even more surprisingly, how much of the classes I never got to play in vanilla still remain in retail.
---
Blizz has got a long, long road ahead to sell me on Shadowlands. They are using the right keywords so far but talk is so cheap, they are still extremely early into development and it shows. In current year, hype is so insanely easy to build but can only sustain you a few months and AAA studios struggle to deliver games that can engage a gamer beyond that. The only responsible thing to do is to hold off on making the purchase decision for Shadowlands until at least 2 or so weeks after release. Which is probably the only sensible decision you can make for a AAA release today.
---
well... same for alliance lol
---
Dedekindcut
---
Yea, many of the useful Alchemy pots aren't until a bit later. You should be close to free action though. Keep in mind some of the recipes are also sold by vendors and not from the trainer.
---
I am, and I just dinged 60 finally last night while Alliance were camping the EPL questgivers, killing everyone. I fought back and dinged 60 mid-battle while I had a priest CC'd. It all happened on stream too, I'll make a highlight of it if you're interested lol. Stereotypes!
---
Take your meds, lizard people are not controlling us
---
Ah yes, there was definitely no lag issues last night in the pov of 4 or 5 different streamers on faerlina, that all said the servers were laggy during world PvP.
---
4 years of lag free private servers and I’ve never seen the issues you mentioned apart from a server crash once in a blue moon.
---
if this is a problem you run into, just ask if anything is on reserve as soon as you join the group. Boom, at worst you wasted the time it took to whisper the guy, get invited, and clarify loot rules. It's really not a big deal. Though I personally believe that you should advertise that your run has reserved loot, doesn't hurt to clarify to "not waste time".
---
Yeah, honestly, early versions of vanilla were just horribly broken and awful, even by vanilla standards. The devs kinda had no idea what they were doing when it came to class balance, so we were left with fucky talents, badly-itemized gear and warriors going around 1shotting people with mortal strike crits.
---
I'd still want to play patch 1.1 WoW though, just out of morbid curiosity of how awful it was.
---
Some other lesser-known tidbits about early WoW:
---
-Originally, spirit was supposed to be a much more important stat, hence why there's shitloads of spirit on vanilla gear. I think it had some effect like reducing your cooldowns or something, I can't remember.
---
-Spirit of Aquementas and Choker of Enlightenment originally had "Equip: Mana cost of spells reduced by 25" as their effect. Yes, just a flat -25 mana on every single spell you cast. It was really OP, especially for Paladins, so they nerfed both items, changing them to spell damage. If a Paladin got both of these items, they could spam rank 1 Flash of Light for literally no mana cost and get +50 mana back every time it crit.
---
-Mana regeneration while casting worked differently. Instead of the "5 second rule" that we know today, your mana regen would stop as soon as you started casting, and resume when you finished the cast. This is why mana regen talent effects say "mana regeneration while casting".
---
-Paladin actually did have Crusader Strike and Holy Strike abilities during Beta, and they were pretty much the equivalent of Sunder and Heroic Strike, but they were removed in the release patch.
---
-Priest's Discipline spec was originally planned to be a melee DPS "monk"-type spec, hence why early zones had cloth gear with strength and agility on it. In early patches, Inner Fire still had an attack power bonus on it.
---
It’s an Australian greeting
---
Remember 
---
Cunt = mate
---
Mate = cunt
---
It’s normal you’ll bounce a bit between zones. Try to finish the zones in full before leaving them as it’ll shorten your travel time. But some zones will just require you to spend time in another one before you can come finish higher level quests where you initially were.
---
gottem
---
trolling?
---
Not for mages
---
On my highpop they sell for 800-1k so u can def get 650 for it
---
It's pretty much a fact of networking. The amount of work the server needs to do increases exponentially with the number of players. With 100 players in one area the server has to tell the actions of all of them to each player. That's a lot of data. No matter how much you optimize the netcode this is a bottleneck.
---
Ours is dps and we do well, no drama and got rag down on 3rd lockout and got binding
---
Dang had no idea. First i chose goblin and thankfully did both quests. Made the items i want. Dropped engineering, deleted the card. Relearned to 1-225, went to tanaris to read the switch book and became gnomish engineer. Didnt even have to do the quests again.
---
Lol.Wow thats cool. I dont see how what you said has any relation to what I said starting from the beginning if your not talking about games.
---
Far from BiS but way better than retaliator if you go fury. As arms with axe spec it's a toss up
---
That's a whole lot of research when I coulda just told you it doesn't work on gryphons.
---
They believe posting on a forum specifically for discussion about a game is a bad place to vocalize opinions because it annoys them and they would prefer it to be like regular /r/wow where they pretty much just put up shitty fan art and cosplay.
---
Yup just got it. I was confused with a sword from ZF
---
But isn't almost every other npc an un'gorilla?
---
The B part of activision-Blizzard has slowly lost its soul as well as its talented dev team and gamer leadership. Blizzard is unquestionably does not hold the same pedigree as the 199x-2008 squad. I’d compare Blizzard to Bethesda in terms of downfall, treatment of fans and quality of games.

How about Vanilla WoW private servers? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw
---
Edit: or some 30v30 guild wars 2? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plAxh57tNd8   
---
My current classic server lags hard af on 30v30.
---
It has been, wow
---
Fair, I do identify as an attack helicopter
---
Yeah I don't think it will work, maybe as a short term let me try this out thing but the core problems will still exist and can't really be gone back on any more.
---
But i believe blizz think they will have a shot with this xpac, probably higher ups telling them they have to try.
---
I just want classic+, currently classic and design philosophies but throw in modern mechanics for bosses
---
Yup it's been great!
---
Wait. But the most efficient way to rank is exactly BGs. So the first sentence just isn't true. But there will always be wpvp because people like killing each other.
---
Hey guys I found the dude in the image 😂😂😂
---
Who the fuck cares? You act like there's some big conspiracy when really they just hid your unoriginal, low effort meme.
---
Haha thats awesome man.
---
same dude.No interest in retail cause I kept up with the story since quitting in cata, but classic is a hell  of a drug
---
Lol had that exact guy message me on Fairbanks
---
44 is usually half of the time played it takes to get to 60. I think level 49 is halfway exp wise.
---
Ah ein Mann von Kultur wie ich sehe.
---
How is it affecting you actually?  Do you feel like you have to scroll more with your mouse to get to other posts?  Is that a big effort for you?  Does it inconvenience you?
---
Meanwhile you come into these posts try to stop us from raising awareness.  Like why waste your effort when you have better posts to go look at?
---
My question is:  Why the fuck can't you jsut ignore this and be about your business instead of trying to muck up our discussion?
---
On pservers our GM wasn't MT and then we had multiple tanks leave after getting bindings. Now we guarantee that the MT won't bail at least
---
Oh F that,  lol
---
I’ve seen it, only for that person to get flamed immediately.  You reserve it by tanking and only inviting casters, which seems to boggle the minds of leather wearing fury warriors who never started a tanking set.  For rogues, idk. I guess a rogue needs to just straight up pay a tank who already has one, or get super lucky.
---
Redridge has got a few, as well as Wetlands and Duskwood--specifically the one for Jitters and from the camp up in the northwest near the cemetery.
---
Ashenvale might have some too, but I'm not very familiar with that area.
---
Once you hit 26, 27, hit Stockades with all the quests and you'll get nearly a full level.
---
Agreed, the question needs options. I am not excited by anything in P2.
---
I can't hear you !
---
Grats! Switched to combat daggers with Fel MH and Distracting Dagger from DM:W OH. Takes some getting used to for sure getting combo points slower and chasing a targets back but it’s worth it for sure. 
---
My overall plan is to go Perd Blade MH, Fel OH.
---
Considering there stock soared today after their earnings report because Classic caused the largest upsurge in subscriptions I’d say that this SHOULD be the forefront issue for their company.
---
Monneyshot..I made it to 60
---
It's really weird too, because their biggest complaint is that it's "annoying to see so many posts"
---
Just fucking scroll past them you lazy shit.  Why are you in a thread you disapprove of bitching about it existing when you could just ignore?  
---
They're so disingenuous and its so dang obvious.
---
This survey needs more questions for clarification. Why are PvE and PvP players answering the same questions without any distinction?

This is disgustingly offensive. My hair has only receded at the front
---
Wtf. Lol
---
I have no idea how servers work, but shouldn't a few million dollars be enough to fix, or atleast, improve this situation?
---
I mean, they are a multi-billion dollar company afterall
---
Always put your question in the form of a statement my dude smh
---
I have Kayla on Bigglesworth, $100. Any takers????
---
Shit, hunters can solo it.
---
r/blop
---
yup, max rank is rarely worth it, iirc it's only significant when it comes to rogues and cat druids.
---
rank 1, however, is wonderful... 35 mana, 30-36 yard range, basically you're trading a single GCD for 20% healing reduction.
---
Someone on Wowhead comments said that using Gnomish shrink ray on raid bosses reduces their melee dmg by a lot, like 20-30%, for 20 seconds.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10716/gnomish-shrink-ray#comments
---
Is that for real? If it is, if you had let's say 10 engineers in the raid, could they reduce the melee dmg of a boss for 200 seconds, which would be enough to kill or almost kill many bosses? And if you had 15 engineers, that'd be 300 seconds which is 5 minutes - same as the cooldown. 
---
Seems too good to be true, so I'm wondering what the truth is.
---
who told you their servers are bad?
---
I dunno why it's slow, but logging isn't really a plausible explanation, unless they're doing something really daft like synchronously inserting every log entry into their oracle DB
---
asynchronous logging can be really, really fast
---
That is literally how things work
---
I am currently in a Guild with 1 GM and 5 Officers and I was recruited as the Main-Tank from the outside since none of them are Tanking.  
---
It's quite unique I would say.
---
It's the best ring you can get at level 10, not 19. At 19 you have access to Seal of Wrynn/Sylvanas, Meadow Ring (3/3 stat roll), demon band, and the WSG vendor ring when that comes out.
---
Grats man well played
---
Last boss of LBRS. But don't dismay. Just be ready with BoP.
---
&gt;You should always swap to zerk while you're charging a priest.
---
You are talking to someone who doesn't have their biggest damage cooldown on a keybinding so......
---
you missed the ACHUYALLY
---
Yeah that was the most fun I've ever had in WoW. Felt like I was actually taking part in a war. If there were no lag it would've been perfect.
---
Classic
---
He’s not been in our guild in over a week. And had been removed due to his actions in the PUG raid he ran.
---
Added.
---
Added a question to specify realm-type.
---
I feel like some of these high value drops get all hyped up from everybody as their mount money and that’s why the AH market price is way above. My experience is with watching and buying edge masters though seeing the same people post them for almost twice what anyone was paying. 
---
My guess is a realistic buyer will be in the 550-650 range.
---
I thought this was gonna be a shit take on the GM but it wasn't. He may have some mistakes in there, which tbh confused me at first but after rereading it I understood what he meant. This is some kind of fuckery that should be checked on, hopefully he can actually help since he passed it off to someone else, though with him naming them the "leadership of customer support department" I can't help but imagine some dude who just laughs at requests from players sent in via GM's and then refuses to send em off to the Dev team.
---
My mistake, sorry sir.
---
:12 for us last night
---
I'm sooo goddamn unlucky. The most unlucky thing that could have happened to me tonight did and I did not get any benefits from it. Everyone else in the guild of my class is stacked out but since I've joined nothing good drops for my class.
---
How many unsubbed after the HK fiasco?
---
Facts
---
Do you have a source for this claim?
---
Vanilla gear/character progression with retail depth and complexity (looking at M15+ and/or mythic raiding) is my dream.
---
This mean i can heal/blind people without losing combo points on my main target?
---
Our Guildmaster is 35 years old, has two children and his own business. He has been level 60 for 3-4 weeks now and has been raiding every single week 3 times per week since then.
---
Actually it's spelled "Ackchyually" and also actually I didn't shy away of proudly sliding an actually in my post. 
---
Long live proud Ackchyuallers! There is dozens of us!
---
Because people used phasing to hop away from pvp. Hop to nodes. If phasing was out in phase 2 the game would have been broken.
---
And on top of that they refused to release enough servers. The solution was transfers but the people who transferred off went to a server with 1/4 or less the active population (good luck finding a group). And the big servers ally to horde ratio is now worse than 2 to 1.
---
All of this could have been fixed if they released a handful of extra servers at launch. When they knew that their current servers would not be enough. But they didn't.
---
uhhhhh they have had 15 years and 8 billion dollars of revenue to figure it out.  what kind of apologist bullcrap is this lol.
---
if Fortnite can support 100 people on phones with the need for accurate projectile weapons,  Blizzard can fix their servers
---
Smeagol is that you?!
---
Oh look, dipshit is spamming now.
---
As a level 53 I can confirm, my anus has been abused. Also fuck any of you guys who are level 60 alliance outside of BRD.
---
I’m playing my rogue alt and I’m on the Plundering the plunderers quest to get lockpicking. I am on the ship with the treasure and the practice lock boxes and I have the two items ECAC and thieves tools, but I cannot use the practice boxes at all. I watched a quick vid of the quest and I see nothing different I am doing. Anyone know if I’m missing something or quest is bugged?
---
As someone who works from 8am to 10pm and have managed to get lvl60 on a dead server now reroll on a decent server lvl 14 right now. Please I would pay serious money for a transfer or a delay lol. Fuck my life
---
They still face a very high chance of getting huge lag killing world bosses.
---
yeah its not like they have had 15 years experience of running servers or anything /s
---
Damn you need bagnon or something!
---
Throwing more engineers at a complex problem is what business people do when they panic. It's not a reasonable way to solve an issue.
---
Well it's a bop item. So your gonna have to run it till it drops and win the roll. Or pay people to run with ya to help get it and not roll on it
---
If you're well versed in knowing how to get gold 300g isn't much but some people view 300g like a huge deal. It all depends on what type of player you are, personally I would rather pay and farm the gold rather than trying to get grps going if u dont have any people who wouldn't mind helping out.
---
I had 2 mates helping me out and we spent 6h getting it for me.
---
i don’t like it tbh, i prefer having separate bags for different things.
---
this is definitely a bullshit post.  
---
Blizzard has made 8 BILLION dollars off WoW,  and has had 15 years experience in running these servers.  And they are having issues? Come on.
---
Yeah. People are fucking stupid. Especially the people claiming they could do this shit better than Blizz. Blizz never let me down before, they will make it right.
---
Then don’t charge money for a broken product
---
isn’t it 12?
---
Lol! It ain’t that bad man, but it is getting there. Kpop fans are fucking scary
---
Sounds pretty hard to do simply because it takes awhile to get to Rend and the drop rate is such crap. How long are you both paying for this? Would you use 2 teams to keep clearing back and forth? It could be hours and hours of 10 people’s time at this point. And then you have to split that pie... if the RNG gods are kind otherwise you are really screwed. 
---
Princess run is different because it’s 1 level 60 and 10-15 minutes with a high drop rate for the ring, so even on bad luck it’s like 4-5 runs for 50g, or good luck 10 minutes for 50g.
---
I ran BRD with a paladin tank and it was going fairly well until Angerforge. I was pulling aggro off him as a healer because he was kind of squishy and I basically had to spam my biggest heal just to keep him up. If his gear was better it probably would have been fine but damn it was rough.
---
Doesn’t silence in vanilla
---
So do I. It's just a setting change in the mod and you get to auto sort stuff :)
---
Exactly. And yes!
---
Escort quest in 1kn?
---
Love it, let’s go Smolderweb! Add me if alliance, Holyshnitzle :)
---
Your mental gymnastics are grade A.
---
You belong on this website.

This literally never happened to me. Wtf?

Edit: Shit I just realized that 90% of the time I make the groups myself and thus rarely deal with pug leaders.
---
Well damn I had no idea lol
---
This
---
Wtf is this post
---
&gt; but could make more on the AH.
---
  
---
Have fun with that.
---
The grey documents probably brought more money. They are quite valuable.
---
This can be easily explained. The Gryphon isn't your mount, so it doesn't gain the bonus from your trinket. If you were to give your Carrot on a Stick to the flightmaster, it would function as intended. Alas, it is Soulbound, and the Flight Master has very important work to do, he can't be expected to run off to go chasing a Hydra, can they?
---
Two people in my guild did, they are now back playing.
---
MUH O(X^N ) PROBLEM

MUH BACKEND VERIFICATION AND ANTI CHEAT

---
Games aren't some magic world where software engineering works differently.
---
Bought SF for 50
---
Found another live one
---
What I like, is that I played Eve Online through the 00's, back in the early days a PvP fight of \~50 people would lag, they only got above 500 reliably with Time Dilation and they had all sorts of engineering blogs about some of the crazy hardware &amp; coding solutions they came up with. 
---
Hell, there's a reason your standard FPS was limited to 64 players (dedicated) or 16 (peer) until recent times. So seeing all these threads with the 'but but but but' just makes me chuckle.
---
Now get the Two Ring
---
There is a command called /castsequence if I remember correctly. Just google for an example.
---
and in the darkness bind them.
---
Why are you so certain? There's already a lot of WPVP even with no rewards.
---
Tell that to NASA
---
Moral of the story: show up on time for raids.
---
This is a dedicated shill account, downvote and move on
---
Fyi: people have done better than blizzard in the form of private servers who could handle the load.
---
tbf hawks do eat a lot of rabbits.... you may be onto something here. lions wouldnt though
---
Blizzard and game companies in general severely underpay engineers, so it's not unreasonable to assume that they do not employ the best talent in the industry.
---
I was in an Arena + Anger + Golem group.
---
One guy had HoJ reserved. One guy had the epic chest reserved. The hunter had something reserved from Arena, I had the Second wind Reserved and one guy had the other thing from Golem reserved.
---
Everyone wanted one particular item nobody else wanted.
---
I see you getting ready for Tuesday.
---
Why not? There isn't really coming that much: Honor system and 2 worldbosses. The keyring finally gets added. World pvp is much more fun when you get points for it.
---
&gt;Blizz never let me down before
---
Oh man, you must have never played Diablo 3.
---
Roll for it.? We auction it off to the Raid. Use the money did Gbank.
---
Fresh 60 with 3 rogues could do it.
---
because retail bad
---
It’s gross. We call it Vendorshaker.
---
Private servers had a 60% corner cutting advantage and Blizzard have a 80,000% budget advantage, this talking point is lame and designed to shut down criticism of Blizzards crap service.
---
Arcanite bars have tanked in the past week, down to 56 tonight from 63ish
---
But the thing is, they can roll on that piece of gear that they want. We literally don't take anyone who needs the HoJ. This is how it works. Why would I join a HoJ reserve run if I want HoJ?
---
As a main combat rogue i really enjoy popping those CDS in oh shit moments to save us from a wipe when it's a pug group doing some hard ass elite quests none of us are fully rdy for. 
---
Like hinterlands lol. Or dun garok. Using my blind on a pat or healer saves us time. Make the most of any class you play. I think ppl are liking rogues more n more.
---
100–150g for reed. 250-300g for Dals. Everything else 50g.
---
Go to any other server
---
It did NOT work for us, but that's because I had a lower GUID than the other tank, and I accidentally stole aggro from him right as phase 1 ended. I'm gonna have to test again next week, hopefully without me screwing it up.
---
in wrath i caught the turtle mount on my very first cast, so I made sure to never catch another one again so that when people saw me on it and inspected my stats, they would see that I had 1 cast and flip out
---
Completely broken. Doesn't work at all. Should be free. Sounds reasonable.
---
Just pay 15g for the drop lol
---
The the the
---
Ohh wow, this was almost exactly the prices I quoted to my mate who wants to do these sale runs.
---
From 20 to 30 I did Redridge and Duskwood. The quests there are pretty numerous and linear. Duskwood has a lot of running from Darkshire to raven hill though.
---
It's not even good exp lol. You kill like 8 mobs max before anger so there's literally no reason to join a HoJ reserved anger run unless you just like wasting your own time to help strangers get geared. This is something you do with guild members in exchange for later helping them run for a piece of gear that they need.
---
If u want everything you go gnomish make your bop's drop engineering and relevel goblin.
---
I only played rogue in vanilla so...
---
They could also just push phase 3 and add battlegrounds. Most servers will be unable to do world bosses anyways.
---
.... are you implying classic players will move to shadowlands?!
---
YES
---
Which are the bop gadgets??
---
HAH grats, assuming you are Maxmeridius. You put me on ignore for beating you 1v1 and 4 levels below you, blamed it on the ret meme spec.
---
Grats again loser(jk)!
---
Did you mean to type 10-20k? I've never encountered server wide latency issues with a pop. of 2k active players, not even on the most bootleg of private servers.
---
bad meme, as a gen z i love classic.
---
PVE servers have discords where guilds are already discussing times to fight, you can always flag on PVP. Not to mention city raids and the like still happen.
---
Whelp time to quit classic.
---
The luckiest thing to happen to me so far was 3 HoJs in a row. I'm a healer tho so it didn't really matter to me but at least I can say I was there.
---
But its literally called ’Battle for Azeroth’ how can the client not be designed for this
---
Wait what is I don’t speak this
---
Unsure about the trinket, but tbh most bosses available deal so little damage that it would be more beneficial to have damage trinkets on instead and just kill it faster, and save the debuff slot for something more useful.
---
Beautiful
---
He means he got it, he's the guild leader named Maxmeridius, dudes a tool lol.
---
Hello, Super Nintendo Chalmers.
---
Because consumers have always been right about their demands. He’s placing all value on data, which Blizzard is most privy to, so by this reason Blizzard can make the most informed and accurate decisions.
---
Does anyone now how often Server data is updated in Warcraft Logs? I want to see my name at the top of the list
---
Only for raids. I'd rather have the stats for dungeons and PvP.
---
I've always heard this but never verified it. I haven't found it to be true personally though. Honestly 50-60 feels like the fastest decade to me besides 1-20. Also you have pretty much your full kit by then making playing the class smoother and more fun.
---
If I ever find the motivation I’ll post a vid on how to glitch the mobs that anger spawn so that you can 2 man him with any classes
---
Other said it but I'll add that WA is the best to track just about anything you want. Most people made one you can just load and go too. Import option. Find them on wagio
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
wow what a creative solution to kill all the fun of the game! /s
---
Where is the keyring option for the what are you looking forward to the most?
---
Maybe I should buy some Blizzard Activison stock lol. That way blizzard would actually care about me

Yes that poor noob and his disposable income, how sad for him
---
Blizzard is hoping.
---
but you need like 250+ fishing to fish in northrend?
---
Noticed you used F1, F2, F3 for your stances.  Did you know you can bind it directly to those buttons instead of using the action bar?
---
Does this still works good? Not nerfed or something like that? Heard about it and watched some videos about it
---
You can transfer them all
---
Hemo? Maybe under certain circumstances the + 7 per attack could be more than the 68 from SS. But the reason it's in the build is because it's 35 energy instead of the 40 (talented) that SS is. More combo points, more finishers. The Sub tree is all about dropping as many finishers as possible.
---
if your asking for a survey... no, I do not have a source per say,  just most of my guild and my RL group of friends... most meaning all but 1 with a "maybe" he will stay till BC... there will be many who stay, sure, but I feel it will die out pretty quickly compared to Classic+ which will continue to pull on nostalgia strings while at the same time giving intrigue with new/polished content... maybe most of my circle played since vanilla, and those who played BC first are probably those who are more outspoken on going for the expansion... who knows
---
&gt; No changes but Fear is broken as fuck. Most of the time mobs run in a straight line like they're preparing for the Olympic Games. 
---
Welcome to old Fear.
---
not in pools you didn't
---
No 'View Results' option this time?? Why??
---
You can poly until the debuff wears off
---
Then the other tank needs to be main tank if you have the low GUID

It's friday the 8th here in Europe and CEST time now is 6:59 AM. Either I don't know the weekdays or Blizz has a typo there or something :)
---
CEST is in summertime, it's CET atm and it's 6:00 right now
---
Don't bother the metasexuals when they're mating you might get bit.
---
Fuck you, you shut the fuck up.
---
Bad as in you could have got more or bad as in guilty for making out like a bandit?
---
Don't spam it,  but hit it once early to grab all the mobs attention,  tab swipes around as long as you have 3 or more targets,  and once you're down to 2 targets alternate mauls between them.  Only hit shout again if you actually need the incoming damage reduction,  not as a threat mechanic.
---
Yeah it's been awhile since I played so I admit I forgot about co-op and archon
---
Then you’re fine if you’re level 21. level 60s dont get honor from anyone under level 48. 
---
Why will phase 2 increase in fun vs the games current state for someone level 48-59? You are already allowed to pvp if you want to.
---
Yep. Boo. Was excited to have a small time slot of playing.
---
When would it get broken...the 10 ring? 
---
I think the 30 ring would be. The 15 ring would be strong but not broken?
---
7
---
Can't tell if this is a joke or your just blind?
---
But did the rogue find love and/or a DM run?
---
sometimes i see mobs go under the floor and you can't fight them (evade), next moment they teleport 30 meters away
---
Fourthed
---
U don't touch perfection
---
You're totally right. I thought it was 6 AM here in New Zealand, when it's 6 PM actually.
---
Gotta be, unless the scumbag that put a password on /lfg did it to multiple realms, lol.
---
Well said lmao
---
This needs infinitely more upvotes
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
6 1/2
---
Wonder what's happened to the real Thex.
---
Right but it takes time to implement these changes. It's not like they're just like "welp time to squish levels to 60 because Classic!". These were issues discussed in WoD and Legion. But definitely when levels stopped providing bonuses that felt rewarding.
---
Damn. 
---
Well, take the average for Cassandra’s Grace (0.04) multiplied by the average for Edgemaster’s Handguards (0.01) and you have a 0.0004 chance of that happening; 0.04%.
---
 But that requires being social and assertive. The people bitching about reserve groups are neither of those, why is why they never form their own groups.
---
'easily'
---
Nope.
---
Guild leader could be anyone, ours happens to be a lock.
---
The raid leader should be a dps class thats not the main tank or healer.  Its someone that can view the raid as a whole, without getting too focused on doing their job.  Our raid leader is a rogue.
---
maaaaaaaaan seriously. the realm has been shattered... what are we supposed to do?
---
I'm drama free, but I'm not.
---
Y'all remember when that guy made a mod for SC2 that turned it into World of Starcraft, and people thought it was awesome, and Blizzard's response was to shut it down instead of saying "Oh shit, there is big demand for this, we should make it a thing."  
---
Blizzard is bad at literally everything that isn't directly related to 1) art and 2) making fun games (which they then fuck up).
---
your experience is lacking deep understanding of what retail is good for. A heroic dungeon can be soloed by this time with many classes in actual gear thus this can't be compared to 55+ dungeons of classic, to 30-45 at max. You managed to get most of your bis in classic, good. If you put comparable time into retail you would be able to clear m+10-15 and heroic raid with ease, probably try a few mythic bosses. That's considered casual difficulty mind you. And that doesn't require you to put 40+ hours per week to achieve as well.
---
"sometimes u get dich"
---
Prolly corpse run 3 of 4 times
---
If that Orc was wielding Iron Foe, doesn't that allow you to speak to Dwarves in /say and /yell?
---
 Idk! /join LookingForGroup? Lol...?
---
I'll probably die some time around 2040-2050 but you can bet I'll be watching you play D4 and Half Life 3 from Hell.
---
You have to be doing some staggering mental gymnastics and self-delusion  to convince yourself that 10% of all US military spending, even in 1966, is "very little money".
---
What other lies do you tell yourself? That Blizz is a small indie company? That you don't look like the guy in OPs picture?
---
Did you eat glue as well?
---
You just agreeing with what we are saying; Blizzard is cheaping out HARD.
---
There is absolutely no reason that running multiple realms should be decrease performance. They should all have their own dedicated, independant performance.
---
Haha nice
---
They've horrifically mismanaged the Starcraft IP and it's a damn shame.
---
Highest rank garotte you can get is rank 6 in Vanilla. So your theory is incorrect because in your link it says it was introduced in 2.0.1, yes, but it also says that it requires rank 7 which isn't able to achieved by level 60
---
What
---
Whats the point in summon fee when it takes like 1 min to run to rend and if they go outside to summon guaranteed rekt by opposite faction so the greed for 5g just aint worth it
---
Literally unplayable
---
Saw your last post. 
---
Very nice that you have added the feature to upload others, I really loved the census addon back in the days. So I just type "/cr scan" and then I scan people nearby? Keep us updated! Any chance you have a discord server?
---
I’m always entertained by those that get disproportionately angry in classic. I (Healy Druid) was running through red ridge the other day, slightly under level for the area, and ran up on a hunter getting slaughtered by orcs. I got there just in time to see him scream in /s “HEALS” and then he died immediately. So I kept running, only to be called some ugly names in whisper moments later. Like dude, I don’t owe you anything wth.
---
He got that bear brain
---
Because players being players, they loaded players into a zone until it broke, and then whined about it.
---
If the servers could cope with 200x200 fights, players would bring 300x300 and whine about lag, disconnects, rubberbanding and the rest.
---
Then Blizzard would patch things, and 300x300 would be viable, and then the same people would whine that 400x400 isn't viable.
---
There. Is. No. Solution. (well, unless you want to abandon server-side checking and make it a glorious mess of client-side cheats).
---
Get over it.
---
You know there is a patch coming right? This reads more like you screaming for attention that it does like a legit complaint, since you're complaining about something that hasn't happened yet. Fuckin drama queen.
---
50/50
---
Goes great on a salad though.
---
Because mocking reserving loot is extremely stupid. 
---
If you don't like people who reserve loot, don't join. People reserve loot for the precise reason of not fighting for loot. I genuinely can't understand why someone would make a group where they fight over the same drop with someone else, when they could just not, and make a group where no one needs the same item. (Reserve)
---
G0 back t0 rEtAiL
---
Getting rank 10 (champion) back during vanilla was a huge personal achievement.  I made sure to keep the title on at all times, especially when they did away with the ranks. 
---
 I was in college at the time so I pretty much dedicated every moment aside from relationships and school work.  I hit a wall with the time available and sleep requirements.  Rank 11 was just not possible for me back then.  I sure as hell dont have time for the upper ranks nowadays.
---
we got him boys
---
Lol 2020, you mean December 2020 or Jan 2020? If you think the problem can even be fixed in a month I got news for you buddy
---
right, 60$ expansion every 2 years keeps wow profitable and not the 13€ per month for 2 years between each expansion
---
please just stop responding, ty
---
ya the mages in my guild still do it
---
close to 50g an hour i believe
---
Legit sounds like a job. Lmao
---
Why do horde raiding guild even exist? Everyone knows paladins are far superior in every way.
---
I like comparing stats when looking at achievements, it's neat
---
Yeah these kids are just drama queens trying to jump the gun and soak up some attention. Wait for the patch and then if (I mean shit, probably when, but we'll see) it sucks complain.  
---
People like complaining more than they like playing the game. Ever since AOL connected to the internet shit has been going down hill.
---
I feel it's less that the servers can't handle it and more that WoW just can't handle it
---
Um, you know as a paladin your job is to heal correct? You won’t be doing that very well with this spec.
---
dix out
---
Right, I think I screwed it up. I passed him at like 68% without meaning to and he couldn't get it back in time for Phase 2.
---
People did it all the time because the mount was super hard to get, so if you were sitting in org on your mount, people who had been trying to catch it a while would inspect to see how many cast you had done. I got whispers all the time doing that
---
Gotcha, I didn't think to add the minimums up.
---
If it's that amazing, why are you playing classic instead of playing on a pserver?
---
Nightfall is better in a hunter's hands btw.
---
Vanilla wow there's links in the OP
---
Ah, hello fellow Outlook user
---
They do, it's called retail.
---
I play ele shaman and as of right now, it is the most broken class in vanilla for pvp because of Elemental Mastery + spell batching. You cast a CL and Earth shock right after, they both crit 100% of the time, so its two really big back to back crits that can just delete people with less than 2k health. 
---
You wanna stack +nature damage or +spell damage in all your gear slots. Whichever has the bigger number that you can find of.
---
Uh because lights Hope is gone? But they even allowed you to download your characters data
---
There's a TBC lights Hope server opening I'll probably go play that
---
Need 10man Karazhan Dungeon(Raid?, like UBRS) for Classic+.
---
The same people never thought about the original architectural decisions to put things like Molten Core *in an instance* and why this might have been a good idea.
---
TLDR : You know the stupid pointy-headed boss who wants something even though its impossible, and is proud about not understanding the technological reasons it's impossible. That's the players whining about 400 people doing PvP in the same place breaks the server.
---
What addon are you using for enemy health?
---
Yeah? Is there?
---
You know what's in that patch? Honor. Idiot. Lmfao
---
How do you get the names to be different colors?
---
Nah dog, as a player it's my job to have fun. I'm doing that very well with this spec.
---
Observer bias will make you notice the negative over positive encounters.
---
That said, people are cunts. Especially with no repercussions.
---
I was always tempted to get a second account and level a rogue from the other faction just to kill the shitty people I encountered.
---
But being a tank was an even better revenge.
---
oh for sure. this isn’t an argument about what makes more gold, but rather just an experiment to see what i got out of these bags.
---
most realms already have layering removed at this point
---
Literally none of this is accurate for casuals. It's hardly even accurate for hard core classic players
---
I've heard a number of friends praise Legion. It's something that if I was in the right place in the right time I might have given it a shot. But with BfA I hear tons of negativity, and just in passing it doesn't look like it's for me. It's quite likely only Classic would hold my interest for now, but I'm keenly aware it does probably have an expiration date of feeling I've completed enough of it to get really bored. It may be years, especially depending on if they go to BC and WotLK, but just seems like delaying the end til it'd be controversial to suggest Cata or Classic + beyond WotLK as a known quantity.
---
0 FR on everyone but tanks if you give everyone 2 FR pots.
---
This is literally causing a mental lapse for me. 
---
Does. Not. Compute.
---
Yeah just trying to put things in perspective when people refer to this as "lag"
---
It's not lag. Because nobody's ever heard of 30,000ms of lag
---
So basically same as now.
---
I generally feel  that Eve handled it the "best" way possible with their Time Dilation system. 
---
But you are right, if a faction can bring more people, they just will, up until the point the game simply locks down. No good way around it, only some that are less shit than others.
---
But that finisher is Evis, which ignores armour, right? It's pure damage.
---
Yes but again the level squish they were talking about back around legion was around 10 levels taking it back to 60 right as classic was taking off is clearly a move to capitalize on classic.
---
What’s +1? Never heard of it.
---
What have the 2 months to do with it? Obviously the server populations aren't as declining as Blizzard was hoping they do, but that is completely unrelated to randybaker's comment of how 2 months are too early. Too early for what?
---
Same. Actually feel dirty doing so, but Classic is just too fucking good
---
You say that like people don’t spend money they really shouldn’t on things they don’t need like... all the time.
---
Why are people so unwilling to accept that being able to purchase something and it being a sound financial decision are not the same thing, or that you can’t waste money even if you can afford to lose it?
---
My sub runs out in 4 days and I most likely won't be renewing.
---
Even if the servers weren't laggy there's a massive amount of bugs and TBH trying to rank with no Bags sounds absolutely aids
---
I guess nostalgia made me love the game 15 years ago as well...somehow.
---
i dont get the people at 60 saying theres nothing to do. Now is the time to farm gold if anything else, because of the "nothing to do" as in no pvp rewards or harder raids or many raids to do besides 3 hours a week, its the gold farming time! You won't have much time to farm gold soon enough being busy climbing pvp rankings so go make that 2k gold now!
---
Agi is better then strength for leveling. You aren't looking for Max dps on a long haul fight you are looking for single target kill speed. It takes a ton of strength to reduce the number of attacks you need to kill a mob where as 1 crit shaves an attack of letting you kill faster inconsistently.

Yeah but one is pretty much a mobile game with very few to new MMO or RPG elements while the other is a MMORPG. If thats the plan, it wont ever work hands down.
---
Great to hear. It's hard to keep up to the many eSports scenes out there
---
Xd who's dr seuss?? dumnb nerd shit i bet !
---
You can use staves as your 2 hander before 20. They are really solid at low levels anyways.
---
Silverpine
---
Reminds me of when this sub was collectively losing its shit over the sharding bugs in beta which I never experienced.
---
Shimmering flats turtles are lvl 30 - 35 and drop good greys for that level
---
I almost didn't turn it off for the lulz, so plenty of people I'd guess
---
Raptors in arathi or stv. If you have cooking you can use eggs or meat (they drop both) which to make roast raptor and curiously tasty omelette which vendor quite well.
---
I launched retail and started getting frustrated for no reason. Didn’t last 10mins. I guess I really do like classic.
---
I've heard nothing but terrible things from my friends about legion and retail wow as a whole. If you like being rewarded for merely existing and doing dailys then maybe it's for you, eliminating weapons for weapon paths or artifact weapons whatever they called it was enough for me to laugh legion out of my memory.
---
Big yikes
---
Correct move in a guild setting, all hunters will get a leaf sooner or later. However in pugs it's a free for all, if its an upgrade then hunter should have equal claim to it considering it's not bis for either the hunter or the rogue.
---
50:50
---
If happens, or it doesnt. So this is basically and mathematically correct
---
I mean like if you loot all the trash and vendor all the Jung, you'll probably get close to your 4 gold back
---
If you can handle this much stuff at once you should play fighting games. You'd prolly be godlike
---
I've been playing private servers for years. If blizzard can't fix this issue I should probably just stop playing wow
---
Turning it off is one of the first things I do. I'm not saying I need profanity to have fun, but the censorship bothers me. Same concept with shows Gordon Ramsay does. Sure, I can watch Kitchen Nightmares with the bleeps and enjoy it, but I'll search online instead to get a version without them.
---
You will get more then 4g in just raw silver from drops per run.  So it’s basically free exp
---
Just give us a keyring. That's all that matters in p2.
---
These servers are going to die. Faerlina is hanging on by a thread people constantly get kicked for no reason.
---
What bubble do you live in?
---
Outside of Arena TBC was awful. There's almost universal understanding that Wrath was far better.
---
TBC
---
Easily the worst leveling experience of any expansion.
---
Uninspired dungeons using recycled content from other games.
---
One 10 man dungeon at launch. Limited amount of, difficult, and time consuming end-game raids. Sparse raid release schedule.
---
Shattrath is one of the worst cities in the game.
---
Release timing of content very questionable.
---
Like I said Arena is good, and I can at least understand how some people enjoy Black Temple. But I just feel like this is a good example of people getting excited for something on the horizon.
---
I'm not a fan of achievements as I feel like they overhaul the game design approach in a negative way, but in almost every other respect Wrath is far, far the superior experience.
---
Usually only the tank needs it and you run arena and golem for other peoples shit.
---
No. I’d rather just not get into 120v120 battles anyway, they’re a mage and sapper game even if the servers worked for it. I want to farm honour in a smaller group in 5-10v5-10 pvp.
---
And what are we gonna do when we have 1k people fighting over Azuregos or Kazzak? Cant get over it. 'Players being players' makes it sound like its our fault server gets lagged out for 200 people fighting, when it definitely is not.
---
Did you read what said though?
---
It doesn't say anywhere that this is the highest number.
---
it says the "highest quarterly increase", there is no indication that it's highest number of subs ever.
---
Not working on Android?
---
Excellent question. Server "rankings" per logs uploaded generally take 24 hours to update. I do not know the precise time but think it is sometime early morning US.
---
How do I use the /who command to search for, say, a warlock in a zone?
---
I wouldn't be OK with it, I encourage and hope for this to happen.
---
P2 can eat my ass. We need *real* servers.
---
Despite the fact that it's been proven possible to do by people who are less well funded than Blizzard. Stop being an apologist.

---
Faerlina's blade is already on life support and dying. We're so fucked.
---
Blizzard: everything is good
---
Investors: -3.2%
---
A lot of the bugs mean that are still in the game have been known since beta and not been addressed.
---
So this assumption that Blizzard is going to release massive fixes access the board simply because they're launching a patch is pretty idiotic. They didn't even fix the game for LAUNCH let alone a minor phase.
---
Unless you have concrete evidence of them even acknowledging these bugs exist in the first place, your post is basically "this is fine"
---
Ok boomer
---
Let's not forget the best fishing pole outside of SFE is from a horde only quest.
---
Thats something completely subjective and something no one else can give you a definite answer to. 
---
If its 4G for the whole Group, i personally would be fine with the price. If its 4g each person, that would be to much for me.
---
ZF GY runs were getting me about 10,000-13,000 exp (not rested).
---
Work out how many runs you need to level and x the cost per run.
---
I've rarely had an issue finding GY runs, and the odd occasion I do I either play an alt or quest.
---
/who warlock *zonename*
---
&gt; dungeons using recycled content from other games.
---
What do you mean by this?
---
Thank you for the response! I will look out for it tomorrow then.
---
But he was still looking :O
---
Nice! &lt;After Dark&gt; was the name of my first raiding guild in Ravenholdt EU so it's kinda funny to see that Pic ;)
---
/who lock zone will pull up any locks in that area.  
---
That’s /who (space) warlock (space) zone name.
---
Bleeding edge progression usually added another raid night to the week, but once you get stuff on farm you knock back to minimal days. Most raid guilds probably won't be so gung ho. Probably won't be much of a need for it in classic, depends how naxx is tuned.
---
I assume he meant ZF gy runs. So skipping all mobs and just killing the zombies, my guildie got roughly 2 bars per run doing zombies + scarabs at lvl 45 when being boosted. XP is okay but not great.
---
Digging for treasure and digging for knowledge are very different things. And blacksmithing is very different from a steam tank.
---
That's amazing, hahaha.
---
Smart but you can get those names for free from inactivity, just put in a ticket.
---
I was quite the geek back in vanilla, and I'm pretty sure I came to the conclusion that neither carrot, mount speed on gloves nor mithril spurs increased flight speed. Simply put it's a different mechanic from the burning crusade flying mount which is actually a mount.
---
I can probably list 20+ guilds on my server that is raiding MC every week, and I learn about new ones on a regular basis. When I play on my level 30 priest I will rarely see more than two other people in the same quest area I am in, and finding groups for instances is pretty much a crapshoot.
---
Vanish.
---
&gt;everyone being nice in classic
---
literally who
---
I guess my comment was kind of dismissive.. I'm actually excited and I haven't subbed since wrath! I just lurk classicwow cause I'm living vicariously through you guys.
---
MadSeasonShow talked about it and idk, if they keep it up it might be fun. Plus I just heard about the endless content, that might be baller. Idk yet though, seems fun imo.
---
Blizz just wants to max profits so they will just release tbc since it requires the least amount of work I bet.
---
lol are people dumb? integrate classic into retail? even blizzard isn't that stupid.
---
Can’t tell if Australian or German...
---
Security guy here. They are largely talking out their ass with a little bit of truth. Ignore the blizz drone saying this is ok. They have a server that tracks mob counts, received input and does sanity checks. You can still fly hack, walk on water and no clip. Not only this, but the biggest joke was saying they have such a large amount of dats to process due to server side bot detection. What a joke. 
---
People like that guy annoy me in gaming communities since people upvote what they think sounds right, not what has facts. He mixed a little bit of knowledge and a lot of bull. Also, nobody says “the checksum”. That’s like when your grandma says “the Nintendo”. If you want a easy explanation of a checksum, lookup MAC(Message authentication control) or CRC. Crc is more used in programs, mac has variations that are used in networking.
---
Cool, looking forward to gear score and 'link ur achieve' soon.  Thanks for this not.
---
Show us the character
---
That was very unexpected lmao
---
Why would anyone who likes classic want TBC?
---
You can't have all of those things.
---
It’s fun af. Some uses In pvp and if you wanna 2 man arena runs or other content with a healer the shaker makes it a breeze
---
1000% yes
---
Because ANY expansion is a gear reset as it should be.
---
Im with this guy. They either drop and they don't.
---
I'd guess about 100,000 years ago
---
SM/Ruin pvp build
---
Unfortunately?! You don’t enjoy conceptual penises?
---
They are all pretty meh. For a progression server the only option is Netherwing. Scripting is not great for pvp, but people seem to enjoy raiding there (can't speak to pve personally).
---
Other servers like Smolderforge, Deathside, or Endless exist solely for PVP (instant or near-instant gear), and have scripting of varying quality.
---
Overall, TBC private servers are not nearly as active as vanilla/wotlk private servers are, which is worrying to a guy like me who is hopeful Blizz releases TBC in the coming years.
---
lmao i needed that laugh
---
Correct move in a guild setting, all hunters will get a leaf sooner or later. However in pugs it's a free for all, if its an upgrade then hunter should have equal claim to it considering it's not bis for either the hunter or the rogue, rogues should aim for strikers mark.
---
So lock and pally epic mounts count as epic riding?
---
Retail feels like a single player chore simulator and a lot of iconic class skills are either gone or every class has something similar which makes classes feel homogenized.
---
Is that because of the Pop? For me, Pop is flexible. Just not a "dead" server or a 5 hour queue server.
---
And net income for three/nine monthes in 2019 are lesser than in was in 2018. This is bad report.
---
For real tho
---
We’re a late night NA guild, but that is pretty cool!
---
It actually isn't a DPS increase for the hunter if he has either of the 2 crossbows I'm thinking of (blues.)
---
I hade 4 60s atm Warrior, Warlock, Dwarf priest and Ud priest
---
UBRS runs aren't efficient to do for gold though, and it'd be less if theres multiple people.          
---
Right, I did say mining does make gold, but I wouldn't depend on mining in the world for it since any high pop server doesn't have any time where people arent farming.        
---
Okay, grats about the alt mining thing I guess? It's not that relevant unless you know the time it took to actually make it, but again better ways to farm.        
---
And yet again thats the whole thing I said, herb and mining is better (for farming DM E) IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUPER RARE RECIPES. Although none are a gold sink unless you purposely ignore transmutes / daily cds.        
---
I'm honestly not sure why you're so deadset on enchanting not being worthwhile. For them DUO farming DM E when one of them has herbing and mining makes them a fair amount more gph.          
---
No one will DE chest earnings in tribute runs BECAUSE a lot of them aren't worth it. Why DE a blue thats worth &gt;2g to vendor for a &lt;2g brilliant shard. But again, irrelevant to DM E farming.         
---
Since you I assume haven't done DM E farming, I'll explain.      
---
You have 2 bosses (3 if you do blood elf but not worth if you have a miner). Out of 5 items hydro drops, (based on my server and likely many others on average), 4 of those will make you gold disenchanting, where the 1 not worth it is a weapon. (this assumes large brills are &gt;1.6g+ on your server). For the 2 greens, on average assuming dust is &gt;30s per, and eternals are &gt;4g per (again selling these on a raid night $$$$$$ price wise). Same thing for zevrim, but you have 1 weapon not worth, 1 item sometimes, and 3 that always make you more gold on average.
---
The 2 ring was 22 to all stats.
---
/r/classicwowscreenshots/
---
We are 3 weeks into the fight, still fighting
---
Thanks Sregge for the explanation.
---
Now OP;
---
My god what a fucking stupid and convoluted loot distribution process. My brain broke just trying to follow the example in the above link.
---
All that this system seems to do is make who is eligible for loot to be confusing and lack transparency. 
---
I would run a million miles as a pug from this shit system. Why not just merge the two guilds and form a proper raid guild that doesn’t need three sets of rules that favour one lot over the other.

I think it’s quite telling that in my 15 years of playing and raiding that I’ve never even heard of it, thankfully for good reason.
---
Totally not an issue with a full guild run, but two guilds and pugs? This loot system is your problem. If you got 2 guilds plus pugs you need a fairer and more equitable loot system that doesn’t disadvantage anyone not a member of the predominant guild. Just /roll for MS and get on with it.
---
Are people unable to read, nowhere does it say what you guys think it says.
---
It says it's the "biggest quarterly increase in subscriptions" that's not the same as the highest number of subs ever.
---
For what it's worth, tried it tonight and it worked flawlessly for my guild.
---
I use combuctor as onebag3 didn't work for me as well.
---
I remember when I had my first beer
---
How does a 60 rogue with T2 still not know to never use evasion vs a warrior?
---
Wait flurry proc in the offhand resets the swing timer for the main hand?
---
I just downloaded it, but Desperate Prayer appears to break it, since it has no cost.
---
All tanks should have quel'serrar by now. Guild should fun the book purchase if necessary.
---
thats... interesting lol i've ran deadmines on my priest twice now. first time was at lvl 18 with an 18 bear and a 24 warrior. did it no prob and 2nd time all 3 of us were lvl 24 and easy mode it
---
Agreed. What about loot? Scale it all down to lvl 60 stats?
---
Yeah, I'm not in any rush.
---
Much better than the 2 ring!
---
Hi Orange, there's a few guilds on Remulos (Horde) that raids GMT+8.  I'm on GMT+8 and playing in Remulos Horde side.  Hope this helps!  DM me for more info.
---
Aye
---
Not to rain on your parade, but holy shit literally everyone in this clip played horribly... except the mage.
---
I mean the private servers definitely do it's just not to the extent of blizzard servers. But ELI5 was the best I could do, not much point getting into the nitty gritty.
---
great community btw
---
It is 2% but only affects your actual weapon damage. Paladins have no attacks other than auto attacks so it's pretty trash.
---
Ah, the difference between those who were twelve when vanilla launched, and those who are still twelve.
---
Yessss, now gives it to me precious...
---
I've seen Savage Gladiator Chain and Foror's Compendium drop, without farming Arena or DM all that much at all.
---
Yes.
---
Popular things attract assholes.
---
Or better yet:
---
Un’Gor’Illa
---
Desolace is the place for you. Nearly everything is skinnable for medium/heavy leather and drop greys that vendor for 5-15s that stack.
---
The artisan skinning trainer for Horde is here in Shadowprey village and really the only other people you’ll see in the area are a few other levellers, people heading to Mauraudon or the 60’s looking for Rexxar for their Onyxia attunement who can’t be bothered with lowbies.
---
It is such a better grinding spot without the bullshit of STVietnam due to its remote location.
---
Lotus are 60 ish and pearls are 40 iirc
---
I’m pretty sure the pre-bis crossbow is better than Blastershot. It should always go to a melee.
---
I never join runs with people reserving shit.
---
I tanked a stratholme run and said I was rolling on dps gear. Right before Baron Rivendare the rogue leader asked me if I wanted the black baron cape and he booted me when I said yes.
---
People are so toxic it's horrible. Who says the loot is even going to drop anyways. I don't mind people reserving a dal rend sword if they make the raid or whatever but to reserve felstriker as well when it's not even going to drop is just greedy as.
---
Now read my first post again, especially the 2nd part.
---
That was just a quick browse in the morning 9am fluctuating quick a bit so
---
I’d say incendius.
---
Resto shaman, and 10 pieces is not counting pvp items (deep earth spaulders, sapphiron cape) but loot council.
---
You can kite the boss to the entrance and kill him there and you won’t fight any adds
---
I don’t know how early but me and a mate of mine can easily do it with pre-raid bis and a couple of random MC drops.
---
Tactic:
---
- both start close to the boss where he is located (so don’t pull up the stairs with a ranged attack)
---
- 1 rogue opens up with garotte and pops evasion + AR/BF.
---
- second rogue does the same thing but doesn’t use evasion until he gets aggro
---
With enough gear you should be able to kill him before the adds come and you can just stealth (no vanish) if you guys are that geared then you can use vanish during the fight to drop aggro if one of you are low.
---
Adds from boss should die due to BF btw so do not attack them directly.
---
For stealth runs with 3 people you can do it frech 60 i gutes.With 2 man you need decent  blue gear and to solo farm i woud say pre BIS with a few epics
---
You make it sound like we enjoy to get lagg while enjoying world pvp. If there is a war in BRM, People will go there. Not because its fun to break servers but because they want to participate.
---
I must have changed a setting on accident  - I can no longer move stuff around my bags or equip items with the normal click - I have to hold down alt as well. Anyone know what I changed and where to go to change it back? thanks~
---
Yikes
---
I never said that world PVP will cease to exist, but people will avoid massive wPVP when possible because it's unsatisfactory to have it turned into a turn-based game.
---
There really isn’t much to do while levelling. Once you hit 60 is the time you can farm 2 different sets; one with high dmg for pve and one with high stam/ int for pvp.
---
So you admit to arguing without reading anything I’ve said since the first sentence you indeed are not very good at this.
---
Hilariously tone deaf
---
I'd guess so since they are epic mounts
---
Killed him 20+ times, still haven't seen it.
---
Thanks man this was exactly what I needed.
---
According to wowclassicpopulation.com last 7 days census, 32% of characters are level 60. That includes everyones low level alts. So, at absolute minimum, 32% of the player base qualifes as 'hardcore.' Significantly more if you assume people with a 60 have an alt.
---
Ours is a hunter.
---
I just advise against aoe levelling. It’s tough, and not very efficient nowadays since most spots are overcrowded. Frost bolt your way to 60, I highly recommend!
---
Dropped for me today.
---
Lost it to a resto druid 🙁
---
Buy cloth and max first aid then reevaluate
---
You have clearly never been to Australia
---

---
Nope, Gen X are the children of Boomers.  Go back to school.
---
The website is not meant to "judge" people's gear (e.g. for invites to raids etc) but it is ment for people who likes to browse their friends/guild mates/favorite streamers gear and build, and maybe get inspired. 
---
Unless Blizzard gives API access, it will never contain 100% updated gear and build of players and so the website shouldn't be used to judge other players gear etc with (That is also why we state on the website that the data is advisory).
---
I personally loved checking out the different armories of players on the pvp ladder on retail to see their build/stat priorities/enchants etc :-)
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS CLASSIC+
---
Problem is at what point to stop, wrath in the end introduced crap to the game imo (lfg, heirlooms etc).
---
This describes me pretty well. 31, gf, full time job. I play a few hours in the morning after work. It’s slow sometimes because it’s so dead. I’d love to run more dungeons. I play around 8-12 east coast time on weekdays so most people are at work or still in bed in different time zones. I just hit lv 42 the other day.
---
Ok, link me the source on hacks being more prevalent.
---
Glad to hear!
---
Band of accuria? You sure about that?
---
It's not just to playing your class, it's hey I know running this dungeon is a waste of time for you cause we are just randys you don't care about how about we give you a reason to come by passing the first orb to you.
---
It’s 40 people, most everyone isn’t raid spec’d
---
Again: Gen X are the children of Boomers.  Your catchphrase makes you look exactly misinformed as you are.
---
Finally, some good fucking machinima.
---
I’m gonna try this on my warrior for leveling:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LmGed00oZZVizcchzi
---
The idea is to get last stand, which is critical for warrior leveling, then get improved revenge, which is a nice little perk. It translates into a 3 second stun every fight or two, sometimes more often.
---
Next is improved overpower, which will be a nice DPS boost, and I’ll appreciate a more complex rotation. Improved rend (lol) may actually be a slight dps increase, and that, improved thunder clap, and demoralizing shout at least make killing a mob slightly more interesting.
---
Sweeping strikes will be very useful for when I over pull (happens a decent amount), and then I’ll get improved sunder armor, which I stack to 5 on every mob.
---
Improved disarm will help with humanoids; I’ve found that disarming cuts their damage roughly in half. 
---
Concussion blow is great, it’s like HoJ for warriors.
---
Improved shield slam will be a hoot, I’ll see if I can actually win against a mage in world pvp with it. It’s also not half bad, I could always use a 3 second silence.
---
I dual wield while using this spec.
---
Honored with Org
---
There's a ring for caster dps that is great for pvp, too.
---
That becomes relevant even for PvE focused mages because there are some PvP blue set items that are BiS for mages until BWL.
---
Those toy projects had 11k concurrent players... Equivalent to our current production blizz servers... But yeah let's pretend it was only holding 1% of a current server...
---
Tank alts will not be required. As long as there are two tanks, one tank will always have a newer GUID so you only need to make the older GUID be OT that soaks fireballs and then the newer guy can MT
---
Personally I don’t care for world pvp at all. Only do BG/arena and play with world pvp disabled if I’m out in the world it’s to quest and level not waste time
---
Lol kids that rolled on full servers enjoy your lagfest
---
I was thinking the exact same thing. Some people in here are super pissy lol.
---
Again: ok boomer.
---
I lost my pet the same way. Opened 5 tickets. All responses that I was shit out luck.
---
The year is 2019 and OP the cunt is still complaining of internet trolls as if theyve just been created. Imagine being ur dad and watching u make this post. 
---
&gt;no need to call me a cunt
---
Kekd audibly.
---
I did is as a level 32 shaman. Oh boy i got a lot of attention too.
---
Love it! I'd like to pay for some ad space on the next one! Haha
---
Growl is a taunt which forces the target to attack them
---
Don't expect tanks in dungeons and raids to be able to spam taunt like your pet does.
---
Watching your threat is pretty important in wow as a dps.
---
Not just the LFG channel.
---
To be honest sc doesnt necessarily need big changes just constant balance patches.
---
anyone using details damage meter notice it only seems to track 10 fights for overall? is that intended, or is there a way to increase the numbers of total encounters it keeps?
---
Ok, lemming.
---
Really, how many times in Vanilla, players used Wpvp ? And i don't mean random ganking.
---
I mean if you weren't a cunt this wouldn't happen 🤷‍♂️
---
Incendius here too. Wonder why our black lotus are twice as much as other servers. Not complaining  as a herbalist. Even though I've only found one :)
---
F yeah! Petition? XD
---
&gt;Server crashing
---
• Character getting corrupted/lost
---
• GMs unable to help you when some character-breaking bug occurs
---
• The AH sporadically not working
---
• Being unable to join instances/raids because they're "full"
---
• Being unable to log in for extended periods of time
---
• Maintenance taking multiple days instead of a few hours
---
I've played on 3 different private servers, all almost entirely lag free. The only problem you listed that I ever encountered was server crashes and they happened alot less frequently then the blizzard servers did around launch. So I'd rather have lag free 200v200.
---
THis is why they need to bring at least 1 battleground in with P2
---
"LF rogue Angerforge stealth runs, HOJ reserved" (actually seen this).
---
I mean, is this a surprise? On retail Ashran was a laggy mess, and the 40v40 Hillsbrad BG last year was a laggy mess
---
Trueeee
---
I mean you can say that with no proof but I played on at least 3 servers with cyber attack prevention, backend for GM's etc. They didn't have everything and certainly not up to blizzard company levels but to say they simply didn't have any of it is just laughably wrong.
---
Damage once every 5 seconds versus a stream of damage?
---
Remulos (Oceanic Normal) Alliance:
---
* Arcanite Bar: 32-35g
---
* Arcane Crystal: 25-27g
---
* Black Lotus: 20-25g
---
* Golden Pearl: 20-25g
---
* Greater Fire Protection Potion: 3-3.5g
---
* Thorium Bars (20): 9-10g
---
* Mountain Silversage (20): 10-14g
---
visual bug. I did the same on a lvl 20 character who certainly did not have any trinkets or enchantments
---
Yeah man I think it's hard for people to play as much as they did. Family's and something about responsibilities.
---
Lol. 
---
You still haven’t addressed the fact that more millennials play than Gen X.
---
Your pet vs you on threat meters is very hard. Not all info in the threatmeters is always correct. Pets can cause problems. This can be due to the action not being registered or like in vanilla non player taunts just do not work well on the meters. Likewise sometimes in the old days a feign death out of range to register.
---
A Growl is similar to a taunt. It will take all of your threat and you as a range will have to +130% it to take. Please correct me on this if I am wrong but think it is correct. It can cast every 5 secs. Intimidation is just a big threat attacks.
---
A dagger rogue without MC daggers is one of the weakest classes in the game. With MC daggers its top 2.
---
Un'harambe

Do you feel like a Frodo now?

*skilled roy

Apparently it’s a popular name! Thanks

What a waste of a hammer
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2649/growl](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2649/growl) 
---
It literally says Taunts the target in the tooltip = taunt.
---
Wait how does +1 disadvantage anyone?
---
Its literally the most fair way of dustributing loot in a pug environment where you cant use loot council or dkp.
---
It stops people from luck streaking rolls and ensures that the most possible people get at least 1 item.
---
Why would it disadvantage anyone not in the guild?
---
No need to be rude i didnt know the name of the last talent
---
First word in the tooltip says taunt
---
I must have got very lucky, seems that there is alot of that with these mobs... 3/4 down now... Alot of cursing to go with that!
---
The number is probably higher since MAUs are averaged across all three months of the quarter and their third quarter results were for July, August, and September.
---
They have been averaging about 30-35 million MAUs for quite a bit. If MAUs were 30 million in July, 30 million in August, and 40 million in September, that would give them the 33 million MAU reported in these results.
---
What HS macroing?
---
Come back to stalagg we need more ally
---
#SomeChanges
---
Prime example of alliance players here. Fucking help me pleaseeeeeeeeeee.
---
Bad meme. Millennials are probably those playing classic the most.
---
Why would you doubt so many people? I have played tons of vanilla hunter and if I'm saying it is broken, it is broken. FD fails to break up combat in many situations, meaning all you're doing is flop to the ground and keep being in combat.
---
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. From what I've seen any DOT will keep you in combat; sometimes poison as well.
---
African or European?
---
You're not confused, I'm the one who's confused. Was thinking of a different item.
---
There is an After Dark guild on Grobbulus.
---
But they arn't a night guild lol.
---
Okay that's nice and all but I'm 225 engineering, level 59 and I haven't been able to learn gnome or goblin engineering. The quests were never available to me and Blizzard is as useless as ever at answering tickets. I thought we only needed 200 skill to learn either?
---
Also seems way too fast, you would hit the lockout cap.
---
Then maybe spend 2 seconds on researching what you are takling about, before trying to act smart? And then doubleing down on what you said, when i already told you, what you said made no sense.
---
dream few people have. Of blizzard continuing to work and create completely new content for classic ..... instead of releasing tbc.
---
Yeah. I already rerolled a warlock. Hunters rely a freaking lot on FD trap to exist.
---
Consider trying to find out what's happening in your network when this occurs using some analytics software like Wireshark.  
---
Just a vague idea, but maybe the webpage has some sort of WebRTC thingy that is used to compromise VPN users and/or offload broadcasting to P2P , and the NAT traversal is trying to do some knocking on ports the WoW client happens to use, which in turn triggers some anticheat? protocol terminating the connection.
---
The problem is that rogues takes the warrior gear and even druid gear. They are most common tanks. If I had leveled my warrior to 60 I would not invite rogue but 3 mages/warlocks instead.
---
So confused now.
---
what i find weirder is people charging for run, but also expecting melees to pay for invisibility potions. like if a melee can't stealth, he could just tank it and make his own group
---
And lighting. Do not forget what lighting does. 
---
I logged on at launch and I saw default setting was 4. It looks like shit. It looks like what we had in vanilla. Everything looked like it was machine washed and lost color etc. Turned up to 10 and a new world open up:)
---
Man I was farming Omokk pants and Zigris gloves for the last two weeks and yesterday I got them both in the same run, winning over a mage.
---
Weird how some private servers managed such impossible sorcery
---
Like 2019 wow retail that is.
---
I had my cousin help tank arena runs for me to help me get the caster belt and he got SGC on his first arena run ever.
---
By far the luckiest thing I've seen in classic so far.
---
Looks like TukUi
---
I mean. Yes, it is. Because for years most private server players have been completely free from this issue.
---
The fact that the game should be playable whether or not a bunch of players are standing near each other is an obvious requirement of releasing a game in 2019
---
Wait so they left out BFA subs and just highlighted Classic?
---
I'm not sure what this has to do with the OP
---
That depends on the amount of people that want to play.  
---
Wotlk is propably the most sensible place to stop but who knows - you don't want classic canibalising retail.
---
Well i still play civ4, panzer general (1995 lol) and hearts of iron 2 so... oh ye and ufo enemy unknown is still sick and brokenly hard. I only managed to finish it twice and I've been trying for 20 years XD. Kotor is still awsum to load up and run through, I got it on my tablet now... I think I could be playing classic in 10 years from now.
---
Lmfao
---
You win xD
---
The problem with classic TBC is it would most likely use the same system classic does, and be permanently stuck in 2.4. Classic can survive poor raid/dungeon tuning because raids aren't really the main reason to play the game, and the PVP can be enjoyable in a stale/unbalanced meta because it isn't designed to be super competitive. 
---
BC with a complete joke t4, a very easy t5, nerfed to shit heroics and the same mess of an arena meta for however many years it goes? Barely worth playing.
---
It is not a problem. No one plays heroic dungeon. Maybe in the launch I have played 2-3, but after only mythic and mythic+. Heroic currently is for people who are 100% casuals. They can experience the dungeons with bad gear because they just join the queue and get invited eventually.
---
Thanks for the gold!
---
I solemnly swear to pay it forward to equally obnoxious posts in this sub.
---
Most money is from coop and it's the most played mode. Investors aren't interested in stable income, they are only there for "growth".
---
Onslaught priest here. No reason to do any other heals beside flash heal, bounce around between rank 4 and 5(depends on the plus heal I have on), then max. But on ony, I use heal rank 2, I spam them all, who cares about over heal.  Also gh1 is garbage till tier 2, pro tip dont use it over heal, you will parse better in most guilds with it.
---
Why is "fucking" smut filtered and "dick" isn't? Lol.
---
Tbh on high pop realms I wouldn't even try to do either of those quests outside of like 2AM-8AM during weekdays.
---
No changes
---
Or I might go with this and just start blastin:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVxzAxxRioVfz
---
I’ll hang out in Berserker stance and just try to rampage everything
---
I'm not sure how to say this without sounding like a liar/that guy.  But I know a Blizzard dev and he says there's absolutely no way they're going to do a classic+.
---
I think that is pretty much non issue. By the time TBC will be released most big amount players will be already done with the content and hungry for more and will not be playing much anyway.  
---
So they will naturally migrate to TBC and if TBC didnt come they would stop playing. Then you just merge few realms together as needed to keep classic playble for the rest and be happy :-)
---
SOMEBODY STOP THE DAMN MATCH!
---
Wooosh
---
Maybe next expansion for retail. It seems they are going back to the roots.
---
Man is it possible for a paladin to solo princess? Just curious cause I’m realizing we are the worst class for farming lol. Maybe shamans too.
---
Wasn’t it Obi Wan Kenobi who said that ?
---
Why do people want to be able to have a thousand people pvping in one place, game couldn’t handle it then, and shouldn’t be changed to handle it now. #no changes
---
I've been in 4 guilds so far and none of the leaders have been tanks. Had a hunter, priest, rogue and my current is a paladin.
---
I agree to many people moaning, they will be the first to go quiet if it works out well
---
You could try call out cunt and see how many turns around.
---
Big brain plays
---
Those original values are already %, not probability. So 0.0004%, roughly 1 in 250.000 chance, assuming that loot actually gets rolled independently for every item in the table (which I don't think is the case, but we have no info on that).
---
TPS tanks... just heal through it.
---
Im not your cunt, friend.
---
Yeah lets bring it in 2024! Why rush when we can just raidlog for 2 years?
---
ISILDUUUURRRR
---
If you see another mage doing much higher dps, check out if they have buffs up. Flasks, elixirs, Onyxia buff (spell crit).
---
No. I wanted phase 3 to be out already, and you're talking about delaying phase 2...
---
I see people have different channel types in their chat log like: World, LFG, etc. How do you add these channels? I only have general and combat on my chat log. Is it an addon? Thanks.
---
20  v 40 has absolutely no lag... if your computer is dropping frames that is a different story. We had 300 players raid org and until we got to org the there was no lag. It only started when the horde got another 100+ players involved in the fights
---
Freezing Band?
---
I think I'm having too high of expectations for class combat complexity. I've tried every class and kind of been disappointed in its combat, to realize that there's much more to Classic than just the combat.
---
With that being said, which Alliance class and race, in your opinion, has the best class fantasy and lore experience? I think if I focus on that, I may enjoy the game much more. (Not interested in warrior, by the way)
---
Its not even close to half way for xp. Its half way for time invested, with taking lower xp rewards earlier on into account.
---
Sera is better for orcs tanking if they don’t have edgemasters (which many orcs don’t).
---
you need 110% threat in melee or 130% threat from 10yards away (or more) to rip aggro from the tank
---
i feel like people are calling fps drops server lag
---
To be frank, the idea that I'd have to live in a "bubble" to hear people praise TBC almost made me burst out laughing. It's practically the lovechild of half the playerbase and is frequently held up as the perfect example of what WoW should be any time an online discussion comes up about what WoW should be like. 
---
For every one of your points about what's wrong with TBC, a thousand people will come forth with their nostalgia story about entering Karazhan for the first time, or about how awesome and difficult Sunwell Plateau was, or about the difficult heroic dungeons that stayed relevant throughout the expansion
---
But I do personally like Wrath better and I definitely agree with you on that. It was the absolute high point of the game for me and people do generally look back on Wrath pretty fondly now, though (just to play devil's advocate) it does seem to get a fair bit more criticism than TBC because a lot of people also do seem to remember it as way too easy - because of how much people outgeared most dungeons at the end plus the introduction of the dungeon finder (even though that wasn't until ICC).
---
I'm on alliance :( 
---
Are you from GG? That's the only GMT horde guild i know of.
---
and there's no way Blizzard will make a competition with the mainstream wow, classic is just a side project for them
---
That’s a large part of the vicious circle, I think. 
---
This dude is so popular it isn’t surprising people want to be like him but they don’t seemingly realize that his style of play just won’t be possible for most people. Like for example, I doubt his guild would be so gung-ho about including and gearing out a ret pally if that ret pally wasn’t one of the most notable streamers in the business. 
---
I guess I just feel bad for people who spend the time leveling a hybrid to 60 only to be forced into a role they don’t want to play because it frankly sucks and I’ve been there before myself.
---
NugEnergy Classic
---
I completely agree with all of this - I’m the raid leader and main tank. The way I get around having the worst view is delegating the things that need you to be aware of your surroundings to other people, as well as giving up the main tank role on places where I need to have awareness of what’s going on. You get two wins by doing this - you get the room to make calls and not be super critical to the outcome from your mechanical performance and also your offtanks get a chance to shine which makes them very happy.
---
&gt; Current Enhancement BiS raiding gear lists just don't seem to be what they should unless you watch a youtube video that's way too long.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Share your thoughts!
---
&gt; TL:DR- Enhancement is boring but i love it and have questions/wanna hear experiences!
---
I play an Enhancement Raid shaman tank, so I really have to get into the nitty gritty of shaman and tanking stuff. Have you tried that aspect of Enh yet? I recently main tanked Ragnaros and it's unbelievably fun. 
---
Let me know if you have any questions.
---
I am always the tank, therefore I build my groups myself. As soon as I have a resto shaman in my group, I want a DPS warrior, because the synergy is crazy. I already have my HoJ, but I still need my SGC. Now I could invite a rogue who simply can't roll on the SGC, because it's mail, or I reserve it. The warrior either has it or sees how HoJ is a much bigger deal than SGC for him, therefore he's happy to come. Also he agrees that he rolling on two items and I only on one is kinda unfair.
---
What happens? I reserve SGC, he comes for HoJ, I come for SGC, the others come for their loot. Everyone is happy. Without me reserving a 1,6% drop item I wouldnt run BRD -&gt; angerforge -&gt; argelmach in the first place and you'd have one less full plate DPS warrior capable of running arena with just healer.
---
I'd just bribe a healer by giving him the loot that drops in arena do that 5 times until lockout.
---
I played retail for about 7 years total maybe and quit right before the Mists of Pandera got out. I quit because to me it just wasn't fun anymore, the looking for group feature was what really killed it for me. At the beginning I loved it, it made finding groups so easy, then they made it cross server and everything changed. No longer was I seeing people in dungeons I remembered from the past, no more small talk on dungeons just get in get your loot get out, it killed the sense of community a server had. I missed joining a dungeon group and recognizing 2 of the people as players I helped with that one quest 15 levels ago, or that funny dude from the caverns of time run. The daily grind, just giving away of equivalent raid gear for running 5 man's 20 times and the other changes all turned me off to the game but the death of the server community is really the straw that broke my back and it's only gotten worse every expansion since.
---
Now on classic I'm home, I've played private servers for a few years and just love what vanilla/classic wow is. Every time I'd roll a new character id find a guild that becomes a group of friends you can just hang out in teamspeak with, you run dungeons you haven't needed anything from for months just because one of your buds asked you to and even on the 100th run of scholo if your goofing around with your friends its a good time. I get messaged all the time from people I don't remember asking me to do dungeons as a dps saying we ran x together or I helped them do a quest and they added me to friends. The little things like this are way more enjoyable to me then anything retail can offer.

---
Had my chain drop on my first arena at 56. Was quite lucky 😅
---
Man that takes a long time to respawn.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child.
---
If they still have the filter on by the time they are in ungoro I doubt it’s forgetting to turn it off?
---
As a heal, I always try to strike a deal like that.
---
Me:'Just add golem lord for a maximum of +10m per run and I'll join' 
---
Warrior:'No that would take too long'
---
Okay then, try finding a heal for angerforge only/ +arena for another 30 minutes!
---
Because dick is a short for richard
---
Just type /join "X" so for example /Join World  
---
You should join the "LookingForGroup" channel. Thats where all the activity is at. Channels such as "World" and "Global" are player controlled. And every now and then a troll gets control of the channel and bans half the server. The LookingForGroup channel is a permanent channel, i.e. blizz controlled, and won't have half your server banned from it.
---
Thank you very much for this on point presentation. Are there more informations from the person, that did the image?
---
I only played vanilla and had to quit right when BC came out.  I loved Vanilla WoW.  It was unlike anything I had ever played.   Its seriously in my top list of games.  Had a great guild and a very solid group of friends to play with. I did a few free 10 day trials in some expansions but never got into it.  I logged into retail and just felt lost.  All my hard earned gear was obsolete or could be swapped with a simple green. It just didn't seem fun.  Level scaling and what to me seemed like an absence of needing to work with others are 2 big flaws in retail for me.  My brother told me about Classic dropping again and I was excited.  Its MY game and I have a fondness for it.  Retail is something I will honestly never touch.
---
Yeah and warrior's (tank's) taunts can miss and be resisted
---
implying its not a guarantee
---
Got 'em
---
My job here is done!
---
I cri
---
Found the warrior &lt;3
---
If you are an orc, dread is better for fury.
---
If it’s a dwarf hunter then it’s a solid weapon, equal to csc flat out but the dwarf racial makes it stronger in that case.
---
Never thought about that. Gonna have to try.
---
Nobody gives a fuck
---
To be frank, the idea that I'd have to live in a "bubble" to hear people praise TBC almost made me burst out laughing. It's practically the lovechild of half the playerbase and is frequently held up as the perfect example of what WoW should be any time an online discussion comes up about what WoW going forward, how things should be in future expansions etc.
---
For every one of your points about what's wrong with TBC, a thousand people will come forth with their nostalgia story about entering Karazhan for the first time, or about how awesome and difficult Sunwell Plateau was, about the difficult heroic dungeons that stayed relevant throughout the expansion, or the memorable and interesting raids.
---
But I do personally like Wrath better and I definitely agree with you on that. It was the absolute high point of the game for me and people do generally look back on Wrath pretty fondly now, though (just to play devil's advocate) it does seem to get a fair bit more criticism than TBC because a lot of people also do seem to remember it as the beginning of the downfall of WoW - partly how much of a joke most of the dungeons were once people people got obscene levels of gear at the end, plus the introduction of the dungeon finder (even though that wasn't until ICC) and the prevalence of catchup mechanics.
---
I currently play for 3 accounts I activly play on.
---
Is it you?
---
No shit. I did it last night. Was like a 20 minute spawn timer. The named mob respawned 3 times while I waited.
---
&gt; The problem with classic TBC is it would most likely use the same system classic does, and be permanently stuck in 2.4
---
Im not so sure. Consider for a moment that with TBC they don't have to develop and remake the entire world and NPCs and everything the way they did for classic.
---
TBC is unchanged, where as classic azeroth was scrubbed from existence completely. They said a lot of the time in classics development was getting the world and npcs and quests right. If you shave off 80% of that time for TBC development; whose to say they couldnt do patch by patch?
---
I mean, what else are they going to do with 2 years of dev time when all the heavy lifting is already done?
---
those people leveled a little and moved to Un'Goro
---
Eh give him a port you cunt
---
&gt; Affli: Every Warlock spec
---
&gt; Demo: Ends up
---
&gt; Destro: Casting Shadow bolts
---
I guess people forgot about fire warlock? Tested to come close to sbolt warlock (in some cases surpass it).
---
I'm not arguing for 'decent guild raiding'. You are.
---
The topic of this thread was ironfoe. Which, guess what, has a proc effect that mimics sword spec. The chance is lower, iirc something like 3,8% instead of 5. Should a freshly leveled 60 rogue who got lucky with an ironfoe but doesnt have dalrens yet use mace spec or sword spec?
---
Anyway, i didnt meant to turn this in a viability discussion. Ofcourse sword spec is miles better than mace.
---
Im running almost the same thing OP. What I would switch is 2 points from Anticipation and 3 points from One-Handed Weapon Specialization to Reckoning.
---
I havent tried it but I've heard that you could tank dungeons by just getting Blessing of Sanctuary. This would enable going deeper to holy and I might try it when BWL comes.
---
the patch whas like 30mb??? what server improvements do you think fit in there?
---
We have half epic geared guys in our guild roster who still need it. After a 100 runs still no drop. 
---
It stays relevant most of the classic content. It will be replaced eventually by stuff like Earthstrike and the +150 AP against undead trinket in Naxxramas.
---
i got that one figured out to a science lol i swear i’ve min maxed that room, only problem is dying to vanish bug when the golems come after you
---
On retail I have been leading guild for years. Main reason why I tank is because tanks are maybe the hardest people to find. Mainly because you want to have solid tank who is always on raids and who is not going to just gquit in middle of progress. DPS are pretty easy to replace and even getting healers is easier than getting new tank.
---
So I want someone who I can trust that is always there and makes his job.. and naturally that person is me. And usually other tanks are also trustworthy people (usually officer, maybe even your irl friend).
---
I honestly think Warriors/Rogues have it worst when it comes to getting BIS compared to Casters like Mages/Locks and Priests. 
---
I mean all my drops are at 10% or higher if you DON'T count the random stat roll ones :P 
---
Compared to Warriors/Rogues with both swords at 4% chance EACH and HoJ being 2%? Feel free to fill in as I've played a Mage.
---
i literally screen captured and cropped this myself, but ok

MY company did this to our internal IT support... We're an IT company...
---
Usually, yes that's how it works. It didn't work on the event I'm referring to.
---
 S'up cunt, how the bloody hell are ya?
---
There is no way it is that high. You are saying rhat both od those dropping have the same chance ad just cassandras grace dropping
---
A shadow priest in top10 explains why it took so long :)
---
Yeah i feel like older strategy games hold up a lot better for daily play then older RPGs especially civ games, for old RPGs you may replay it for a few weeks or a month but rarely are you playing it 3 days a week for a full year. I've played classic wow for close to 7 years if you count original run and classic servers, if blizz launch a second wave of fresh classic servers I could easily see reaching 10 years. But not everyone loves classic as much as us :p
---
Rich Thorium Vein
---
I've gotten 3 of them already lol
---
&gt; Warlock. I like cheating at PvP and using only half of my long-dead brain cell at PvE. But I am thinking about rolling an alt Resto Druid after listening to Naruto outro music of the first episode.
---
Go fire warlock, you'll at least be casting new spells. and if you do it well you might surpass normal warlocks. [this talks about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbmzehXURHs)
---
I sell major mana pots for 20g x5
---
I have had a similar problem. /reload did not solve it. Exit game and start it up again and all was back to normal. Have you tried?
---
Come on guys. Let's get 100k signatures to Blizz and really ook them in the dooka!
---
They should just release BGs in phase 2
---
A 30 year old is a millenial
---
But the whole stats are grim for the industry: fucking candy crush made more money this year than blizzard's and activision big games combined.
---
I hate it.
---
in MoP (when I started) the first ever headless horseman boss I did I got the mount.
---
My friend was very upset
---
table captions go over the table!
---
My guess is:  
---
They where grouped &gt; mage teleports because no runes &gt; gets called a cunt
---
Opening of AQ...
---
As a mage i click mana ruby, mana pot, frost bolt and some times decurse. There is a misconception that we only click one button.
---
i hate when people compare private servers to blizzard servers like " some russian basement server was working better" i doubt any private server had such massive battles and player count.
---
You guys have general chats
---
They are gona have to when AV releases.
---
Probably assumed the mage was there to 2v1, the poly was kinda weird but he might haven been thinking it didn't matter, "we'll kill him anyway"
---
and then someone comes around and tells you you can kite the boss out of the room to avoid the adds or just evade them with the healer standing on a ledge ;-)
---
Nice. I ran Mara and Princess dropped the 2h Mace and the Blackstone Ring. I got both. I think that's the luckiest I've ever been.
---
Straight and to the point. Have to respect that.
---
omg what a waste
---
Is there anything to do in Deadwind Pass in classic?  Other than gawk at the beautiful desolation.
---
This guy has never seen Waynes World.
---
Important Note:  Biggest Q3 increase.   They have never released anything in Q3 before, no expensions, no real content, so its not really that shocking.   Its written in such a way that its easy to miss that, marketing is after all, still marketing, especially to shareholders.
---
R 3 T a I l N 0 oB
---
Definitly yes!
---
I seem to not be seeing all chat messages being posted in General, Trade and LFG global chats, I use elvui so Im unsure if that has anything to do with it. Has anyone else had this issue? My party mate/friends tell me about a message they see but is not showing up for me.
---
Yeah I don't have the savage gladiator chest yet. Best bet is to keep 3 manning it or finding casters.
---
If you're forming the group I do understand it but I've always just said fair roll. I always believe that when it drops I'll win it because I deserve it more haha.
---
GL on getting the glads chest  man.
---
Awesome to find out there's plenty of other guys who have full time jobs and raise families that enjoy a bit of Wow in their spare time.
---
33 w/ wife and 2 kids, level 47 mage..... the grind is real but 60 feels SOOOOOO close.
---
I just started a new guild on Thalnos - Alliance. We have a lot of spanish speaking players on server so that is difficult for recruitment. If you are a dedicated player come on by.
---
How about spicing things up and playing an unconventional spec? You'll have a new way to perceive the game and it mentally engages you to improve yourself. the boys over at the [off meta](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) discord are writing guides and doing some truly beautiful stuff. There's everything from fire warlock to melee hunter.
---
&gt;You don't have the source = you don't know.
---
Developer here. Your own comment literally contradicts your first statement, you have no idea if it can be fixed.
---
ofc we had, the only time during vanilla i had a crash because of the number of people in  world pvp was the gate of AQ opening, and that was 2000+ at the same location.  
---
100vs100 was a normal raid day on mc/bwl. 2 guilds vs 2 guilds is not something uncommon
---
The filter makes everything more funny
---
Could you explain for me plz?
---
Private servers don’t have this kind of population.
---
wow awesome. So how much +heal do priests have in pre-bis and mc gear respectively to get an idea on where to look to (low level priest here)?
---
Diablo 3 was amazing. So I don’t know what you are trying to get with this comment,
---
You'd rather have a ret pala or feral druid wearing it?
---
Go for what you like, enjoy. Most optimal is arms till you have enough crit and hit.
---
I'll try that now, thanks
---
Dude how did u get hp Numbers?
---
That isn't the solution to their problem as even small servers will have fights large enough to suck/lag out. Blizz will just release BGs and people will BG for pvp and world pvp will not work just like classic.   
---
Sucks cause I was sad back then too.
---
&gt;We need to stop sweeping this issue under the rug and address it head on.
---
You been living in a cave. The sub may as well have changed names to "r/complaints about blizz servers"
---
Yeah, all the youtube videos of world pvp on private servers are faked. In fact they were recorded on BFA servers with classic UIs and classic gear.
---
Cyclopean Band i think
---
Well it could be carried by an African swallow.
---
Haha nice! Funny thing: I am the guild leader of a guild named „PvP“. We just have three level 60. I am 56. No one has raided so far. We will suck in phase 2 . Leveling is also slow because every other player from the other fraction sees a huge “kill me” sign 😂😂
---
You must be playing a different game. Because vanilla had lots of crashes. Hell we had servers being down for days. You joined 3 months before AQ? So you didn’t see the early world city raids that destroyed the servers. 
---
I guess it also depends on what was the population of your server. On my server an Orgrimmar raid would cause massive lag and often take down the whole server.
---
haHAA
---
What about satyrs in felwood? I was thinking about trying that spot later today myself.
---
Tried same as you in wpl, but just too many players farming there.
---
If you ctrl alt delete and right click world of Warcraft you can set it as priority in the settings, idk if this will fix this specific problem, but it’s helped me with lots of problems
---
I guess I’ll be that guy, what Addons do you use?
---
Something badass about Shadowmoon: the main Ally place is a dwarven fortress, and it’s Wildhammer, too. So uniquely awesome, IMO.
---
Spiders in lbrs
---
And tbc introduced flying and divided the world. Classic, while terribly imbalanced, is the most cohesive version there is.
---
Same for me, went there with a group of friends and we waited for like 20mins. Then when the quest respawned, some random rogue snatched it from us and we couldn’t be bothered to wait another 20mins
---
I had 25k queue on firemaw around launch day. That’s double nostalrius just in the queue.
---
Cheeeeeeers cobba
---
My luckiest day was going for invincible and getting it. Decided to try for the Phoenix right after and got that too, all in the same night, within 15 min of each other. My friend was pissed and threatened to come to my house and punch me in the throat lmao
---
That’s not an unpopular opinion, it’s just a factually inaccurate claim.
---
Bevore classic release everyone was yelling no one will play it because it is an old game and only some nostalgic fans would subscribe again to quit fast an switch to retail...So who is laughing now?! I tried to tell it to them but no one was listening and now I yell at those same people who thaught they knew it better with them big mouths...EAT THIS!
---
snowflake
---
Can you start farming them at 55+ as prot paladin or its risky?
---
-to rule them all
---
Very nice way to show them who the baws is
---
No heroes of the storm :((((
---
DPS check bosses aren't going to be nearly as daunting as people remember.  Vael was difficult for guilds who had issues with tanks picking up Vael when the MT was blown up, blowing up their own raid, or not understanding basic mechanics.
---
People are blowing Ragnaros, a boss most MC guilds stalled very hard on, before he can even go into phase 2.  A deeper understanding of the game has moved content along at a very rapid pace.  I expect Razorgore to cause more issues than Vael anymore.
---
Gear blocks will be gear blocks.  Resist fights will still require the requisite time I believe.  But who knows, we'll see where this goes.  I'm just along for the ride at this point.
---
There are so many multiboxers in Classic. I started my own trinity team, and while i was questing from 1-5 in dun morogh i saw 3-4 other multibox teams. Classic is great for multiboxing because Gold is so important and you don't have to buy the game to play classic, just subscribe an account.
---
MoP class design, Legion and BfA bosses with a gearing system that looks more like Classic in some sense (Not sure how tho). The dream
---
I got my Sgc on my first BRD run as a level 52. I got several fuck you's in whisper as my story spread by rumour
---
Thanks for the info man. Isn't the drop rate like 1%? You guys got hella lucky if it is. It sounds like great fun anyway, I'm definitely keen to give it a try once I hit 60; sneaky boss kills and stuff is always a good experience. 
---
Another question, well two really: Can you stealth to the boss without clearing anything? And is there anything which drops that druids need (will check this when I'm back at a PC)? Sounds like two undergeared rogues and a druid could stealth in and do it even easier.
---
Vedra not taking any more of this shit
---
I completely understand your motives and in a vacuum you would deserve praise for your work...
---
But the problem with pandora's box is that you never know what will come out of it, and when it does come out you won't be able to put back in.  Gearscore came into being when the armory was born, it's just a fact.
---
Private servers also didn't have to make the game as close as possible with source code and just tried to recreate it. See: Dungeon XP and damage resists.
---
Yes, its a waste for a warrior. Especially a gnome who now is rage starved.
---
Also giving it to a tank warrior..
---
I believe I still have his skull on my old main. I'll ask it later.
---
well I got herbalistm on my main and mining on my alt.   
---
I do DM jump runs on my ult but it's simply far less efficient for me then looting BlackLotus during night times.   
---
It probably depends a lot on the amount of players farming though and wether you can play during the night or not.     
---
I tend to get 2 BlackLotus per night with about 40min time spent within 3h30ish lately(checking nodes in 7min, loggint out). Much higher success after server resets (there's usally 0-1 competetior for me after reset, just stand on one node and log in early, wait until servers show up, 42g profit  (Lotus price on my server, more if I make flasks with it)).    
---
Rich Thorium farming feels so inconsistent to me and takes much more time for the same profit. But yeah during day times BL farming doesn't really work efficiently either.
---
Tonnes of the responses to this post have been please wait cause i need more time to level etc
---
It was easily between 5-6 million at launch, and I have been saying this number since 2017, when they announced Classic. Ofc I have been downvoted and mocked, called crazy, etc. For me, it was common sense, and understanding of what Classic actually means for old school gamers.
---
There are between 3-4 million Classic players today.
---
Beats Retail by at least a factor of 2, if not 3. I estimate BfA playerbase at 1.1-1.3 million, tops.
---
Sure, Retail bring more money, from monkeys buying all the crap from cash shop, but as a player base, Classic is at least twice, if not 3 times bigger than Retail.
---
We don't need Blizzard to announce numbers... it's fucking crystal clear that Classic is the biggest MMORPG on the market, beating everything : Refail, FFXIV, ESO, etc.
---
How the fuck do people afford this shit. I must be fucking poor.
---
I called all our priests useless and noobs and showed them how spell coefficients work in relation to heal per mana. I am now the priest class leader. I am a resto dudu.
---
I'm lvl 39 warrior, hitting 40 lvl soon. Got my mount money stashed already. I also have mining and bs. Should I consider rerolling bs to engi? My skill in bs is only 80, do it wouldn't be huge loss. Engi provides some great item, and I swe everyone seems to value epic engi shield a lot. I plan to tank after hitting 60. I want to stick to mining for a while to farm mats at least for engi and earn money for epic mount. I'll reroll it eventually.
---
I literally couldn't give a flying fuck less.
---
My wife lived in Germany for a few years in her teens and that was her favourite beer. We found a shop here that sells it (probably illegally) but it costs a fortune. Gut beer.
---
Absolutely not. They had 21 years to fix vanilla/classic. The fact they shipped in such a pallid state, devoid of almost all end-game content doesn't give them license to just sit on their asses doing nothing.
---
Classic should have shipped in the state vanilla was designed to have been in, if it had all the features planned for it.
---
So no, Blizz gets no free pass at all.
---
i mean, does the drop matter if the server is still layered? when it's not layered and you see less and less people, then yeah, i can see the "quick drop down" but, as of right now, servers are still overpopulated and blizzard has no initiative to rush release anything, especially with 8.3 giving them another boost in subscribers soon
---
I think Reserving Items is a stupid Thing to do.
---
Have fun the hunter quitting after a month. Giving it to an offtank spamming hamstring and actually doing damage with it (horde) is A more fun, B more effecient.
---
What server is this? I see a smackdaddy everywhere
---
Timezones!
---
Kick it outside like a normal cat, and get yourself a keyboard
---
That cat has bigger balls than you
---
I would rather get Classic TBC. It was the better game compared to vanilla imo.
---
So yeah what Lord Crusader?
---
Druid pulls from top of stairs with FF, rogue kills any ranged adds then the rest. 
---
Drop an expose on Angerforge. 
---
Before he summons adds, druid drops down stairs and heals, and tanks him along the stair wall. 
---
If you position it correctly it bugs the adds and they dont engage.
---
MonolithDKP is prob the best addon to use
---
You mean the huntard in this case.
---
"honorless target" was in since day 1 lol.
---
I remember our server crashed when about 80 people showed up for world dragon. Maybe partially because it was the mushroom one but still.
---
Given the general statistics of the average skill level and attitude of most hunters, I agree.
---
Really nothing. No quest, no quest objective, no rare mobs, nothing. There should be a spirit healer IIRC.
---
I did the same but with Invincible. Got him on my first ICC run ever. Ended up being my only run ever
---
So basically, you’re an asshat.
---
Well I guess you’ll just have to enjoy it anyway
---
Is it an Unpopular opinion becouse you're flat out wrong about pvp battles in Pservers and vanilla?
---
You described the exact thing that ruined WoW throughout the years.
---
Ever since DM it was really hard to find healers for Golem Lord as well on my serv. Seems like the only they need in BRM is lava runs right now. Luckily a guildie helped me with duo spamming arena until i got SGC.
---
I was just messing with you, but as an European player who has the same timezone as server time it's odd to see someone say 4 am while ingame it says 7am
---
Yeah well... I got the ooze covered bag in the Wetlands on my first mob, so beat that! Oh...
---
Implying it's not a guarantee because some mobs are resistant to taunts at certain situations, not because the taunt itself could fail.
---
Lmao I love how mad he got
---
100+ days played* before AQ I meant, and I remember servers crashing or going down but not triggered by pvp clashes. We had plenty of encounters going into mc and bwl back in the day  and in the very early days when the game was fresh town raids were pretty common and I don't ever remember it just seizing like it does in classic.    I won't pretend to have an understanding of the technical side of what server hardware is being used or the games netcode  in classic vs vanilla. But large scale world pvp was a thing once and it shouldn't kill the game.     If it truly can't be fixed I wish they would come out and admit that nothing can be done or something.  But do something or say it's being worked on.   I think that's a reasonable thing to ask of blizz
---
That is one gnome level of griefing !
---
They did release DM earlier then what was stated at the start. Not sure why, can be a bunch of reasons where one is drop of players (not saying it is).   
---
And the drop matters because it shows a drop of some kind. Might be server transfers, might be people quitting hard to tell atm. This is one of the most populated servers in EU, if the drop is as big on the smaller servers then you'll see less and less people.   
---
I'm not trying to preach the doom of classic. I don't think it will die any time soon but if you look at the server status atm (be it at 09:20 on a friday) there are no full servers and aprox 10 high, 1 low and 7 medium. The rest is marked as "New players". Compare this to the first 2 weeks after launch (I don't have the exact numbers but I rememeber needing to queue at around 11 to get in at aprox 17 on a server thats now marked as medium)
---
The problem is not the servers, it is the game engine. You can not just throw hardware and the problem is gone.
---
But tbf it is a common problem and Blizz is aware and working on it. What do you think why layering was implemented ;)
---
From a developers perspective it is a) not easy to fix and b) not easy to predict. You simply can't know how software code and architecture will behave when it is newly developed. 
---
I know I get downvoted but even with theoretical and practical tests you can't predict everything. There is always a possibility that your game can handle 1.000.000 players but 1 more changes everything. This is how software development works. It is our job to predict things with our freshly developed code and if it does not work out we find a way to work around.
---
As it should.
---
I got my SGC from UD the first time I ran it. The other warr who started the group asked if I was cool with him taking the Baron cloak, I told him I just wanted the SGC and I didn't know it was a rare spawn. Found out after it was a rare spawn lol, it feels good to have.
---
? I'm confused these are raids that are literally over 14 years old old that have all been done thousands of times. And people are going to be doing Molten Core for almost the entirety of classic.
---
And? Just because it says that doesn't mean it functions the same as warrior/druid taunts.  It generates high threat, it doesn't put the pet immediately at the top of the threat table.
---
Stop getting hung up on the wording in the tooltip.
---
&gt; classic is just a side project for them 
---
WAS\*.
---
It was a side project. It is not anymore. Not when at least 3 million people (which is twice the Retail player base) came back to WoW for Classic.
---
And 3 million is probably the lowest figure here, since we don't have the solid number. Reality is that the number is more like in the 5 million.
---
Blizzard admitting that Classic WoW had the BIGGEST subs increase in franchise history....well, the sub numbers for Classic should be between 4 and 6 million, since there were spikes of subs (quarterly) in Vanilla and TBC and Wrath that were over 4 million subs in a 3 month period.
---
I do a +10 to 12 about once a month.   
---
I log in twice a week for my guild's heroic raid. We get AoTC every tier, then go on break.     
---
I've never once grinded AP... i don't even do WQs.  My Heart is lvl 60.   
---
My friends who just got the game and achieved lvl 120 last week already have higher Heart levels than I do.   
---
I'm not debilitated. If I don't need to grind AP, then you shouldn't either. The game is mathematically tuned so that you will automatically be bumped up to what you need to do current content. The only people who require daily investment are mythic raiders, racing for world firsts.  And that's not casual.
---
Okay not fresh and new like they haven’t been around, but nobody has done them AT LEVEL 60 in 14 years or so. I certainly haven’t experienced it as I joined in late Vanilla.
---
As long as people will still be looking for groups for these raids for the entirety of Classic, or at least for the next 8+ months, that’s cool
---
Value is subjective, therefore what you think is wasted for you might be a sound investment for someone else.
---
If not, people would never trade anything, because that would mean there's a loser and a winner in the trade, while both can come winners.
---
You'll hit lockout doing arena/angerforge/golem lord too if ur group is decent
---
If only it was a Billion dollar company with access to the best dev talents in the world.... **OH WAIT THEY DO**
---
I am doing this too on my warrior, lvl 27 now. I am worried that with more than half of the leveling (and thus new abilities) still in front of me, I will run out of hotkey slots on the "stance specific" bars.
---
I am seriously considering scrapping all the work I've done to set this UI up like this and going for an all fixed bars with macro (i.e. switch to Battle Stance and Charge in one press etc.) type setup.
---
What's your experience with this system as the number of abilities grows?
---
Should of been a vanilla Coke.
---
SomeChanges? Pretty please
---
Lol
---
I never thought of that !
---
I remember going into Shadowmoon Valley at 64 or so while just exploring, and I can tell you that place was *scary* if you're not at the right level.
---
Yes, yes and yes
---
&gt; There's an absolutely necessary sen/ack that must happen when communicating over SSL, never mind the local decryption of a packet when it arrives on either side.
---
See, this is exactly the problem. You hear "Security" and you immediately assume transport security, because it's the only thing you've ever read about. SSL is not a factor. Just straight up - the infinitesimal overhead inherent in SSL is entirely theoretical. It actually outperforms SSH in many applications.
---
Furthermore - they were *already using SSL*. This can't possibly be what's slowing down the servers. In fact, due to the many optimizations over the last fifteen years, TLS is actually [way faster than it was before](https://istlsfastyet.com/). To recap: SSL was never a problem. Even if it had been a problem, it wouldn't have been *this* problem. And even if it *had* been, it would have already fixed itself.
---
And to be completely clear - this has all be one giant tangent invented by you. No one was talking about transport security. I have no idea what the guy above was talking about when he said they had next to no security infrastructure before, which was kind of my point. There's no reason to believe that new security features are slowing the game down. One other poster did try to explain that some game servers do all the validation on the server, which causes lag on the clients, which is actually true. FF14 had that problem for a long time. It's a complex mechanic that's honestly over my head, but WoW is supposed to use a type of partial server validation method that provides a kind of good enough security, validating just enough to keep the clients honest. In any case, the lag added by these methods is a flat lag that doesn't get worse when more people are on - totally unrelated to the current issue. And again, this isn't anything new. WoW had to handle these issues back in 2004. In fact, they had to handle them back in Diablo 2. Patch 1.10 iirc, if you want to go back and read about it. I'll give you a hint - it's tied to the same system that gives WoW that "predictive movement" you were talking about.
---
I don't know what blog post you read, but it didn't give you the education you need to talk competently about these issues.
---
And that’s why I stopped at 13. 
---
14 wasn’t that great for casters anyway aside from the epeen
---
I think by the time we get to the end of TBC, a few years from now, I would be happy with a set of complete new Classic servers and start all over again.
---
Please god no
---
There's no denying that :')
---
Server max. capacity is same for all WoW Classic Server. A long queue is not influencing the maximum players online on a server. So I don't understand why you think Faerline has more players then the other full servers.
---
Can you activate Winter's Chill on all MC raid bosses with Rank 1 or Rank 2 Frostbolt?
---
Can you give a quick tldr?
---
Yesterday I went on retail to get the Deathwing mount, and I went to Eye of eternity on a whim to maybe get the blue drake as the azure one dropped for me 4 times already. I go there first on my rogue and I get the azure drake, what are the odds... so I go back on to another character which is already in Sholazaar basin, so I'm like fuck it, lets go again, I get the blue drake and it unlocks the achievement for the Emerald drake on the way. 
---
What are the odds of that, man..
---
I don’t disagree with most of what you said but doing the grind to 13 myself and to 11 on another alt/server for fun with the top players, there were definitely the odd mediocre people making it to 13/14. Far from the majority but they existed through sheer time spent online
---
Evis does not ignore armour.
---
Ditto. There is no way in  hell I would play TBC after Classic. TBC was a BAD expansion for the game. Don't care about how many players TBC had.
---
BfA makes 10 times more money than Classic, and it's 100 times worse.
---
TBC had more players, but it was clearly a very poor choice for the game : flying, dailies, quest hubs, arena bullshit, removal of 40 men raids, badge vendors, QoLs.
---
No Classic+ (even if it fucking fails), no more sub from me. And A LOT of people. Basically, half the current Classic player base wants TBC, the other half wants Classic+.
---
Blizzard's quickest way to lose HALF of the biggest sub numbers in history is not delivering Classic+.
---
Nah, but you blatantly disregarded what I was saying in my comment. Do you disagree with my reasoning, do you have any actual counter arguments other than people being, and I quote, n00bs?
---
Roooooiiiiight
---
As I mentioned somewhere else, just because you can hack certain things doesn't mean there aren't checks. Just that they are not entirely comprehensive. They still ake up CPU cycles regardless of whether they are perfect or flawed.
---
In retail when a new raid comes out, there's catchup mechanics and everyone ignores the old raids.
---
There's no catchup mechanics, and old raid gear matters a lot, people will be running MC the whole time.
---
Bingo.
---
It's good for warriors too, wdym? Except for BRE, Sulfuras is literally BiS PvP weapon for warriors atm.
---
Feel free to learn to code and do better. You will quickly realize what an arms race it is.
---
shhhhhhh
---
Yeah but no point in articulating it to a fuckfaced dickhead. Blocked
---
A healer rolled on your Star of Mystaria?
---
What server are you on? On mine people sell moonstones and black pearls below vendor price and other gems don't exceed 150% of vendor price
---
Lol I've been trying to explain this to everyone. They WANTED phase 1 to be done with quickly. And people seem to think it's the end of the world.
---
For once it's expected that P6 will be followed by TBC, rendering most previous content void (or at least the incentives to do it and thus guilds organising 40 people who want to). So if you want to see some of the later raiding content, if the schedule is fast this will be a constant struggle to keep up, while if it's slow you can take your time.
---
Also for P2 in particular it really affects everyone who is leveling.
---
Schurke haha, is that rogue? I'm Dutch and that would be pretty cool.
---
sometimes there's competition there, but again best i can pull is 4-5 and that usually includes one caster which im not fond of. Good for farming demonic runes if you need demon forged breastplate though
---
\#nochanges
---
Are you trying to disapprove him? Since I don't get it.
---
Yes and no.
---
It can, technically, but it is an exponential function, so it gets prohibitively expensive very fast.
---
Furthermore, a lot of these sort of checks will be in relation to other players. So you cannot prallelize them, meaning you literally need STRONGER hardware. Faster CPUs, faster RAM etc. At some point it just doesn't exist.
---
Are you delusional?
---
Shadowlands PALATABLE for Classic player? In what universe?
---
Did they announced the removal of flying, LFG, LFR, mythic+, 4 raid difficulties, sharding, CRZ, etc. etc. in Shadowlands and I wasn't aware of it?
---
Virtually ZERO Classic players will play Retail with the above "features".
---
Heck, at this point, they can copy/paste Classic in Retail and call it Shadowlands, I would still not play it.
---
There are better 2hers in mc, but earthshaker shines during Nef Phase 1 progression when your dps is still undergeared.  Also decent for AV
---
Either you haven't viewed very many threads or you are deliberately lying again. Suit yourself.
---
tldr
---
We don't use dkp at the moment, but out of my expirience:
---
I just talked with the people who rolled on the same items, so I didn't have to waste my dkp on class pieces. If you do so, you automatically get above most others with your dkp. Buying weapons early on is usually a dkp waste for non melee classes (in my opinion).
---
Mats for engi seems easy to farm. Gonna switch to it as soon as I log in today.
---
Shit happens. A mage rolled on mail agi helmet by mistake. He paid 3x vendor price for apology.
---
So yeah there was no point to fishing up more.
---
my bad \^\^
---
I’m levelling a hunter right now. It is not a taunt. When I pull aggro, I can actually see the Growl animation go off (three lines above the enemy),m without aggro being lost.
---
I'd be amazed if even 33% are remaining.
---
Idk... My guildie has gotten x4 forors in these two recent days. I feel like the dropchances are busted or im just **extremely** unlucky
---
Or if you have a main/alt/friend/guildy with Goblin Engineering, you can just do Gnomish and have that other character/player craft your Goblin BoEs and your Sappers and Mortars. You'll miss out on the Goblin BoPs: the Goblin Mining Helmet (not needed when you already have a main/alt with Mining), the Goblin Construction Helmet, the Goblin Bomb Dispenser, the Goblin Dragon Gun and the Pet Bombling. But I feel missing out on those is worth the time and especially the money you save by not going Gnomish and then releveling Goblin.
---
Your cat is broken
---
The chances of them doing TBC, Classic + AND Retail are almost naught... Not sure what logic you're using to come to that conclusion. 
---
Classic + is more likely to come in the form of retail adopting some classic philosophies. 
---
They've already said, they don't want to be making two separate MMOs. 
---
Much easier to cash out on the many, many people who prefer TBC and Wrath by putting absolutely minimal effort in and reaping maximum rewards.
---
What's TIDI?
---
evis does not ignore armor
---
Requires sign in.. pass
---
This sounds like memory distortion.. the Lag in vanilla was way worse than in classic. I feel like so many people are seeing vanilla through rose tinted glasses. And everyone who played vanilla seem certain they had over 100 days played.
---
It's not an addon, just type `/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"` in chat once.
---
No sound on mobile.
---
How is it bait, its true.
---
Making bank from rmt too.
---
Had a few of those as well. They refused to do golem, which obviously makes it a pain for them to find a healer. 
---
SUre, golem is annoying to kill, but if you want a healer you'll have to deal with it.
---
I have pet commands and q(attack) e follow. Makes me this having them shift+q and E respectively may be safer.
---
I got the crusader enchant formula on the first kill. I went to the tower where the scarlet spellbinders are, but saw that it was heavily camped by the other faction, so I decided to try it some other time. While I turned around, a spellbinder attacked and dismounted me, so I decided to kill him. He dropped the formula. The other enchanters in my guild still hate me.
---
Happy cake day.
---
The best systems have something in place to stop hoarding, my preferred method is out of the people that want an item the person with the highest total gets it and it costs them all of their dkp, resetting them to zero and the back of the queue
---
"Asking for a friend"
---
Im not your friend, bro.
---
They only tell in this overview that WoW Classic has led to increases subs.  
---
Maybe all the other blizzard games has declined in the player base, because of the hong kong drama, but they will never tell you.
---
I am ok with it as I am still not level 30 :)
---
You didn't resist his feign death.
---
No. That's not available time. Factor in work, commute, sleep, family and food.
---
Yesterday i saw a 57 HUNTER making a group for arena ONLY runs with chest reserved.
---
At 57
---
As a hunter
---
After 1 minute of talking he changed the msg in LFG and World to "chest NOT reserved"
---
On most servers that happened maybe like once. World is much more active than LFG, though I don't get why people spam in both instead of keeping LFG posts to the appropriate channel and using world for other discussion.
---
What a bad taste in humor
---
Grats,
---
I don't recall seeing any ally dinging 60 in a horde capital. I've only seen horde dinging 60 in Stormwind :D
---
I mean, it seems like people literally want to not play the game at all, and then also expect that everyone is sitting there waiting for them, so they can ''somehow'' be at the same stage as people who play more.
---
And then to maximize the insult, they call those people ''nolife fucks''. Like what in the actual fuck.
---
&gt; https://youtu.be/4qwhZRK2E2Y?t=95
---
how is that not lagging? It only stops lagging once the enemy raid is dead :d
---
Look into CEPGP. It’s a pretty good system that we’ve been using for 2 months.
---
There's other bis that drops from arena
---
93.5% of hunters are unable to read.
---
jesus fuck. So WoW should be scheduled around a busy family mans work day free time? Are you fucking serious man.
---
I agree with you. I'm not demanding when the game should progress. I just think it's naive to say people who cant play regularly don't care about the game. I love classic wow but I'm not in school anymore and can't no life it.
---
Blizzard needs to start treating it like a bread winner then and start fixing the many obvious bugs
---
That's one thing I don't quite like about it, the "overall" data seems arbitrary and I can't tell what it's tracking. In recount you get to explicitly reset the data (though that popup gets annoying after a while) and know that "overall" is all that's happened since last reset.
---
our guild uses monolith too and so far, it works like a charm.
---
The luckiest thing that ever happened to me in WoW was getting Invincible. I prepared a lockout with only LK alive on one of my characters (so that I could kill him multiple times per week). Went in and got the mount on my first kill after that.
---
This. As a priest I support that message.
---
I really don't get why people think they are the center of the universe.
---
Until now I never realised how much I need to make a gnome on the rp realm called Gollum and walk around with only this item equipped
---
Anyone who cant fight on par will gank lowbies. Inside instances.
---
Or the fucking warlock who out rolls you on the animated chain neck.
---
Remind me 1 week
---
Or you just invite casters and say nothing reserved!
---
Sucks I’m on a German server because germans have no humor. All they talk about all day is how they pick up their children from kindergarten and how much it sucks to be mean to the opposing faction.
---
I am a warrior main that can be very easily seen in my post history.
---
I've never said that. Im just debating your point on that those who don't play 3 hours a day dont care about the game.
---
Are you forced to use your language specific client if you live in one of those countries or something? 
---
Else I cannot understand why people would do it, I would definitely not use a Swedish client if there was one. Just looks ridiculous.
---
I would prefer TBC over classic+ just off of the mere fact that classes actually became playable in TBC and were no longer in beta from a design standpoint. Had classes been better designed in classic I'd be interested in a classic+ but with how god awful the design of some of the specs are there's no way I'd want more of that after Naxx.
---
Same goes for a lot of the raid bosses.. like raiding took a MASSIVE step forward in TBC.
---
Then it's still a waste? Not saying there's no use. It's a waste of a good item.
---
You have to keep in mind that a classic players are not "jumping off" nearly as quickly as retail players, because of the game design.
---
I didn't play classic for a month or so, but I'm still subscribed. Why? Because I don't feel like being in a rush or something. I don't feel like I'm being left behind.
---
Once I'm Level 60, I'm Level 60.  
---
The only difference between me and other 60s will only be the gear.
---
So if I play only 1-2x a week and play super slow, it's actually good for Blizzard in terms of subscription numbers.
---
But if I play retail only 1-2x a week, I always have to "catch up" to other player, just to be on the same imaginary "Max Level". This forces me to play "too much" and causes a quick burnout.
---
BFA is structured like a F2P game. The game wants to create a high retention rate so you're more likely to spend money in the shop. All systems are designed around that core idea: High Retention =&gt; Higher Revenue.
---
But for a subscription based monetization, this logic doesn't apply.  
---
F2P Systems are all based on the idea of "FOMO (Fear of Missing out)" and almost infinite power gain.
---
Why would I want to play to Level 120 today, if I have to play to Level 125 next week?  
---
Why would I want to play to Level 125 next week, if I have to play to Level 130 the week afterwards?
---
This is what those azerite systems (etc.) actually are. 
---
The problem is not actually the content itself, but rather you burning thorugh the amount of content too quickly. (Which is why Blizzard now tries to fix this issue by implementing 'infinite modes' like Mythic+ and this Shadowlands Rouge-like Tower or 'time barriers' like staged raids)
---
A year of playing classic will probably have the same effect on you as playing a month of retail.
---
Of course, there'll always people, who are a lot more hardcore compared to others. But those people are being rewarded in classic by prestige , which is the main motivation for them anyways. This prestige can be something like unique raid gear, visiting places others can't or completing optional systems in the game.
---
Hardcore players strive for exclusivity. Classic gives those players exclusivity without actually leaving others behind.
---
It's just the first quarter
---
It's just the first semester
---
It's just the first year
---
etc etc
---
Epic Intro!
---
Wouldn't have an issue with it and already did it twice so far. It's nice to be the one giving directions. Yes. The tank is bought and paid by me, we'll do this quest/out-o-the-way boss. Come along or be replaced - this is my run now.
---
Do you guys asking for builds not have Google where you live?
---
Poor attempt at a joke mate, don't take it to seriously.
---
Yes, it's just approximate numbers, to get the idea)  
---
If someone need more detailed one - feel free to check on wowclassic logs.
---
I more or less only raid log. 
---
Im rogue, spend like 100g ishh on enchants, a few or two farming gear and like 2 hours a week farming gold and i manage. 
---
Im not saying you should do anything differently. But what do they spend all that time on? When i log on, i litterally have nothing to do now.
---
I joined a guildrun MC as a pug at lvl 59. Mageblade drops and I roll a solid 92 and none of the other casters comes even close. The guild i'm running it with is decent enough to give it to this random lvl 59 warlock even though it was their first drop. 
---
To date the luckiest aquisition of loot during my whole 10 years of WoW considering all the circumstances.
---
Just putting them with spaces works, the command is smart enough for that. If you want exact results instead of someone that happens to have warlock in their name in the mix (on my server there's a guild "warrior kittens" which often gets me confused when I look for warriors), there's a few switches you can use.
---
    /who z-"zone name"
---
    /who c-"warlock"
---
    /who r-"gnome"
---
    /who n-"charname"
---
    /who 44-50 z-"tanaris" c-"mage"
---
That's fine, but since when has an MMO been targetted at demographics of people who can't even play enough to finish a single raid. I mean....
---
Basically the same person
---
If you look at your report there will be a "updating" or something in top right, meaning the report is still being processed (for validation, and eventually updating rankings).
---
It most definitely sounds almost exactly like most of the material from A Calf Born In The Winter, The Infamous Bill, and a decent chunk of The Universe Smiles Upon You. Con Todo El Mundo has a far more upbeat tone to it and, yeah, I would agree does not quite fit the mold. It’s more of a Khruangbin x Bonobo flavor because of the fake drums and hip-hop progression but I would still say Khruangbin is the closest comparison I could think of. Possibly Emancipator.
---
yea, exactly
---
Half of us won't even play tbc.
---
I bailed right before tbc on my hunch of where the game was going, I'll definitely bail with hindsight having proven me right.
---
Yes, why not? Spell hit is not related with rank of spells. Only with your level.
---
Fucking no
---
Hi, /u/Ossskii

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to belong in our weekly [What Should I Play Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) thread.

---
As a casual, yes ofc. I could use more time to get to 60 and farm my bis
---
Gotta admit I joined one of these runs because I wanted stuff from endboss. Left after it dropped because the warrior refused to compromise. We'll have fun looking for another almost fully MC/Ony geared healer in the middle of nowhere that blows the imps instantly with consecration and wrath.
---
Shit is going the same pace as with vanilla. Deal.
---
&gt; With that being said, which Alliance class and race, in your opinion, has the best class fantasy and lore experience?  
---
Nelf druid. Their starting quest chain about checking corruption of the new World tree is much better than Stormwind local gang wars.  
---
And it continues though Darkshore into Aschenvale.  
---
There it branches into Elfs and Forest vs Orcs and Axes :)
---
Money you enjoy wasting is not wasted money.... well unless you get broke.
---
Yes it's true but it was for the meme hehe
---
Good for you. Sorry that I don't blindly buy into your baseless claims.
---
Ep/Gp is a pretty good system
---
Yeah I totally agree with you, but it was for the meme
---
If i wanted to specify i would include it in my post. Medium european server.
---
problem is when you listen to the vocal minority over asking the silent majority you end up with a mess like retail where things were changed based on "feedback" from players, as in seeing what people complained about rather than asking the player base as a whole what they felt.
---
as for zones becoming a gankfest some already are just people will do it with a purpose after P2 hits. most levelling areas will be fine, only the higher level areas will see a lot of PvP as you get no honor for killing lower levels and you may get camped a little but it wont be the end of the world as people will rapidly see they are getting little to no honor for killing you and give up if they are farming for honor levels
---
Bonobo is great too...have not heard of Emancipator, will check out.
---
Discord.
---
Good, we need better servers now because these ones suck fat dicks.
---
I guess I must be really out of touch with reddit. IMO a passionate hobby is something that gets a large amount of your attention. Now, some people may not have very much time, but then they shouldn't expect that they get to get the same out of that hobby as the people with more time to dedicate to it. I mean, what's so wrong with that
---
Don't get it
---
Do damage on hit buffs from both buffs and items work whenever a melee hit it attempted on you, or does it have to contact and cause damage?
---
This is probably not the most popular opinion, but in my eyes warriors shouldn't rely on macros to do stance dancing. I think that being able to stance dance (as in learning how to do it properly) is the #1  thing that sets a good warrior apart from a bad warrior, and this is more important in vanilla/classic than any other expansion due to how the warrior class - and threat - works.
---
I have bad experiences with warrior tanks using macros to change from defensive stance -&gt; berserker stance -&gt; use berserker rage to avoid getting feared and all of the sudden their macro doesn't work and they get feared resulting in a raid wipe (Archimonde in TBC and Nefarian in vanilla comes to mind). And because they've relied on their macros for a long time - but all of the sudden it doesn't work - they have no clue how to stance dance properly to avoid getting feared, which severely cripples the entire raid. And this is just an "avoid fear" macro, but it applies to other spells too.
---
I've played a warrior for many, many years and I've always used F1 (battle stance), F2 (defensive stance) and F3 (beserker stance), and I've never ever had a problem of felt uncomfortable in terms of switching stances. And I've tanked every single boss in vanilla, TBC and wrath (except for the last 2-3 bosses) like this. It's just a matter of getting used to switching stances, and after that there's not really more to it.
---
Here's some tips which (hopefully) can help a bit. There's much more stance dancing involved in tanking normal 5-man dungeons than tanking a raid boss. But even though there's much more in dungeons, there's really only a few spells from the different stances that in certain situations are being used. So let's say that you're the kind of warrior who likes to charge into mobs (which can be a dangerous move btw), after you charged you might switch immediately to berserker stance which presents you with a lot of "new" spells. But how many of them do you actually want to use? Maybe berserker rage and whirlwind. All the other spells are dead to you in that particular situation, because you quickly want to switch back to defensive stance. Let's take another example: You're tanking a pack of 4 mobs, and all of the sudden 1 of the mobs run towards the mage who has been nuking the wrong target. What can you do? You can choose to switch to berserker stance and hit intercept and then back to defensive stance. Notice that this was only 1 spell that was used in berserker stance - all the other spells were dead in that specific situation. And when it comes to tanking raid bosses the only time you really want to change stance is to avoid fear (even though this might be less used in classic than vanilla due to everyone being dwarf priests or shamans using 2 tremor totems for 1 tank). 
---
What I'm trying to say here is that it may seem confusing at first with all the stances and every time you switch you get a lot of "new" spells (new spell options from stance to stance) but all it takes is situational awareness and a bit of getting used to. In my opinion the warrior is the most rewarding class due to them having stances, and "ruining" it with macros is a bit of a shame. But of course (to prevent too much flaming) everyone has their own playstyle :P
---
They could just get rid of those features. Biggest issue imo would be dealing with the Argent Tournament
---
Unfortunately, this is commonplace with Blizzard GMs these days. Many of them appear to have been outsourced to some foreign country. This is definitely the most extreme case I've seen so far though.
---
 I am happy I got my HoJ yesterday. It is already a shitshow. When phase 2 hits, you better bring some invisibility potion or time for corpse runs.
---
Damn, you can see the Hype for WoD, back to the roots they said, the released character shorts of the orcs drove me insane, they were/are fantastic. 
---
Then after a few weeks people saw what direction Blizzard headed with WoW, more mobile game than MMO and people jumped ship, in droves. 
---
Fucking sad.
---
Probably level 60
---
Its also an Hardware issue.  
---
The AWS servers are being designed and used in a way that its suitable for Sharding / Layer.  
---
Back in the days we had dedicated Blade servers.  
---
If we had those today, with hardware of these days, a portion of the lag will be gone.  
---
But hosting seperate dedicated servers will have a huge cost implication, and we all know Blizzard didnt handled Classic like on of their Flag ship game's, so atleast for now its not happening.....
---
As long as Classic Wow is being hosted on AWS servers these issues cant be addressed.  
---
Cant tell you anything about the engine and the code... i'm more of an hardware guy :)  
---
But people also need to reconsider the choice they mayde, when they didnt used the transfer realm option.  
---
Because of the hardware limitation from the AWS Servers, BLizzard gave over populated servers and free realm transfer.... IMHO you should have used that, but if you didnt, dont be suprised that servers will be laggy, when a huge raid is coming to raid your capital city.....
---
You rolled on small popl server an expected same prices as on overpopulated. Amd when you doscvoered that it doesn happen you create a cry me a river post which literally has 0 sense
---
All the more reason a horde guild should claim the whole island :-)
---
Electrocutioner 6000 drops the key, he's level 32. You can probably solo him around level 45.
---
Everyone is fuckiung know it alls, and acting like nobody enjoys the game.
---
&gt; In recount you get to explicitly reset the data
---
You could config reset of data in Details also.  
---
Unfortunately triggers are kinda meh and I often end with mix of 2-3 parties and solo play)
---
I wonder how many people ITT get real mad when a hunter takes their weapon "because it's just a stat stick for them" but blastershot is BiS for melee so it should go to them automaticaly.
---
Classic WoW - Since 1886
---
And back then you could probably still get more stable Servers xD
---
I agree. I did all content in TBC and WoW starting going downwards after T5 with removal of certain attunments, badge gear being T5+ quality and dropping from all heroics and raids, as well as nerfs done to T4 content. I would like 2.4 talents (before titan grip n shit) but with TBC-release difficulty, not post T5 nerfs/homogenizations.
---
/r sorry, we're full
---
Yeah I'm definetely not getting past rank 8-10
---
If you look carefully, you might see a can of Coke :)
---
Raiding for alliance vs horde is so damn day and night lol. Im surprised most world firsts in vanilla and tbc were by Horde guilds.
---
I can imagine. That must have hurt.
---
Blizzard has had a chance to fix this for 15 years and still havent. Unfortunately even if you wait with Phase 2 until 2030, this probably still wont be resolved.
---
^THIS LOL
---
You really dont have a fucking clue what you are talking about do you.
---
Pservers used unmodified clients. They didn't shift any checks.
---
Also, "checks" are going to be hilariously miniscule in performance impact.
---
So fucking funny reading this thread, is there even a single developer in here? It's like watching children trying to argue over whats the best shade of blue.
---
The problem is the client mostly, not the servers. On the 1.12.1 client on private servers even if world PvP in massive events was super taxing on the servers, at least you could get abilities out, you just had low FPS because of bad optimization for newer hardware. I can't believe it but the Legion client is just worse.
---
Not everyone will be fighting 100v100 I pvpd a lot in vanilla and never engaged in these mass fights. For the type of world pvp I plan on doing the servers are absolutely fine.
---
China is implementing a law to protect children from spending excessive money in online computer games and limit their playtime per day. This will have a huge impact in the mobile gaming market, as it's mostly supported by exploitation of the younger folks inability to see a cash grave.
---
Many Europe countries are in the making of laws to protect children from lootbox and gambling games with real money transactions. This also will have an impact in the mobile gaming market and microtransactions in general.
---
That is clearly a mouse
---
As a warrior who has over 50 runs so far with no drop, I envy your luck.
---
You're the flyest looking 250 dps guy in any group you join now. 😎
---
1. Make a guild group
---
2. Do multiple runs for gold
---
3. Take turns on orbs, everyone wins
---
A Holypaladin dropped at my Mages Neck from Strat Living because he thought " Oh i thought it is spellcrit, nvm still a stat upgrade"....like 1 or 2 int points for him, didn\`t see the Neck drop since that day.
---
Most of the bugs are new ones to be fair, and they've shown no signs of fixing bugs that have been there &amp; reported since beta, like Death Coil critting for example.
---
Just yesterday, I went through the trouble of attaining the recombobulator recipe, mass produced them, only to find out that they're bugged &amp; don't work. 
---
It sucks when you have to produce one of any item &amp; test it to make sure it works on official Blizzard servers, when the item works perfectly on the supposedly bug-ridden private servers...
---
Yes. 110% with all of my hard and every fibre of my being ** YES YES YES **
---
I rolled on a high-medium server and every price i mentioned is anywhere from 40 to 75% of a high server shown by auctioneer and it makes perfect sense to complain about not being able to sell anything for those prices. 
---
You commenting here without talking about situation on your server adds nothing to the discussion and you can keep being petty and downvoting all you want.
---
The funny thing is, if you asked any of these care bears what's actually happening in Hong Kong and why protests are going on they'd have no clue.

As far as i know this is an English speaking sub.....
---
Woah I met a dude in an mmorpg and we talked. I LOVE this community. I'd die for it. I'd kill a baby squirrel just so I can be part of it.
---
retail can't handle even 50v50 combat dude.
---
I straight up refuse to believe anyone thinks 40-man raiding is the apex of raid design.
---
It is legitimately awful. Just because you can shove more people into a single area doesnt make it better. Loot distribution is completely fucked, the sheer amount of people is insane and corralling all 40 to do the same task is a headache. 
---
They wouldn't even be able to make a raid with more than a handful of mechanics with that many people having to be aware.
---
No it's not. Many, many reasons that there are no queues : server capacity increase, people more confident to be able to connect when they want so they disconnect easily, migrations, etc. 
---
Unless you have a source, your assertion is garbage.
---
What makes you think they'll change such fundamental inner working of the server? I dont think you realise how these things work and assume it is just some sort of magic box...
---
Spirit
---
My commenting is as useful as your cry post. It is quite obvious that smaller population  will have weaker market. But for sure crying here will help to sell items for what you think is their value
---
It was discussed at Blizzcon. In short words - new models would look off in the old zones and it would create dissonance.
---
250+ Arena runs. 21 Times i got gorosh. Still no chest. Yesterday a guildie started the grind, got it 2nd run. Another guildie got it aswell yesterday, about 20 runs. Rng is just a bitch.. I feel somewhat burned out already.. And me "losing" the race while others barely participated somewhat takea away the eventually relief at the end. In conclusion it is generally not really worth farming something like that
---
.. But its the only Thing im missing outside of raids
---
I mean, to be fair that would be a pretty huge fail if such a substantial and hyped up release like WoW classic didn't get them the largest quarterly sub increase ever seen.. so it's kind of to be expected (this news).
---
Keep in mind this is QUARTERLY, meaning short-term.
---
No!!! We need honor to keep players playing...
---
It's almost like. The mega servers/entire server infrastructure was fucking stupid and they ignored us in asking for a simple authentic experience and opted to try to experiment with new technology in a completely new context instead of like. Making sure there were enough stable servers and actually having pop caps.
---
All this bullshit is the price we all pay for the shills eating up the sharding/layering garbage. Is this dogshit worth a "stable" launch that still was a mess anyway? We've had to deal with augmented economies, layering abuse and exploitation so that we can have this trash experience because the servers weren't properly prepared because they expected 75% of us all to be gone by now which is ridiculous.
---
They're treating Classic like one of their trash expansions where the game is completely exhausted of content/gameplay potential in two fucking months and they have to force out anything they possibly can to make up for the lack of engaging playability. Except that Classic doesn't need that, all it needs is stability and support, yknow, the only reason all of the private server players are coming back to pay them money for.
---
healing done, mp 5, spirit, intel

Heh,  here it is at least 20 per cores and 35-38 for arcanite bars.

Why aren't you answering my question?

Congratulations you're now a father!

---
That's 25k people that are *not* that is not playing on the realm. That's what being in queue means. With layering Blizzard also diluted the notion of what people used to mean when they talk about a realm/server in the first place. Of course it's nonsensical to aggregate the people playing on different world instances when we're talking about the server/realm load. It wouldn't be any more or less taxing for Blizzard to have everyone playing on the same "realm" if they just layered it as many times as needed. Many games do exactly that.
---
The simple fact is that private servers have handled considerably higher loads and player counts than Classic has done and done so better. For example: here's some private server stress test footage

It's like Ligma, only more clever.

No, dragonslayer doesnt give ranged ap, only melee. The buff says ap but it's only melee.
---
It was never my intent to increase server prices by making an obscure reddit discussion. Go from here and be toxic in overwatch or league or whatever you weebs play these days.
---
You are not being toxic at all calling people weebs.
---
Was this idea inspired by /r/pathofexile?
---
Go back to economics class and learn about how supply and demand works.. also smaller population always means more crafting within guilds because all the raiders are within 5-10 guilds only.

What's the trick for not taking damage from lava?
---
I'm trying to get to the black forge but I just keep dying
---
I wondered that also but as I had one sent straight after and that arrived. As soon as I type w his name comes up and only person I know or sent mail to starting with a W. I just thought after having a ticket open for over 2 days I would have at least gotten a reply/update etc.
---
Does everybody else have issues getting trained in random battlegrounds (mostly spriests).
---
You can deal with that by merging servers, the playerbase is already split across them.
---
Yeah I just hit 23 and I find it so satisfying. Each level up actually feels important and I can actually set a goal for my next play session
---
Well, a lot of people (myself included) have already tried and cleared the content many, many years ago. I see no rush to clear everything again for the thousandth time, honestly. I don't play Wow Classic to challenge myself, for that aspect I have different games to play. 
---
"Going hardcore" always comes at the cost of something else (at the very least, opportunity cost). For some people it's also an easy way to burn out very quickly.
---
This is what gets me, there are people who have a little bit of server/engineering knowledge and think they know EVERYTHING. They know almost nothing but preach like they have all the answers.
---
I'm sure Bobby Kotick is not gonna pocket any money from all the subscriptions and 100% of the money gained this way will be put into infrastructure and staff salary.
---
Say what you will about pservers, at the end of the day they had the better service for free.
---
Yeah when you play on a pve server you don't have to be afraid of anything.
---
As someone who played the majority of vanilla as a warrior, when I fought a rogue I would gladly trade every single ability on my bar if it meant I had Overpower on CD until your HP was within execute range. I won nearly every single duel against a rogue because of Overpower. Don't underestimate how insanely powerful it is, especially against an arms warrior with Improved Overpower.
---
A cause I can get behind.
---
DM and ubrs trinket?
---
Dont have to be an idiot to make a mistake.
---
Can you please explain why it's not good for warrior? Since it is one of the best PvP weps you can get atm.
---
Blessing of Salvation (reduces threat generation by 30%) is literally a game changer.
---
Which route do you usually go? Do you go straight or pp everything first?
---
casual cross faction collusion :D
---
I guess i should have specified better. All the sellers put items on ah for the same price as on high server and refuse to sell at a discounted price, all the buyers refuse to buy until some moron puts lionheart recipe for 500 or flurry axe for 120 for example. I for example mentioned crusader, it took me a week to sell for 170 when there are only 3 other recipes all within 220-270
---
Statstick a, Statstick b and Statstick c
---
As a level 60 holy raid specced priest, what do people do for solo PvE content?
---
I can’t work out if I should be equipping shadow damage gear and using shadow spells, or spell damage gear and smite/holy fire. 
---
So far I’ve focussed on healing gear, but my priest is a total wimp outside of a raid/dungeon.
---
I'm not, where I work has code that is 19 years old. It runs like shit even with shiny new servers. They need to upgrade their spaghetti code most likely. But that can take a lot of time, even moreso when the people who wrote don't work there anymore. Plus if there's no comments/docs on what does what then they have to work it out.
---
The Videos are bad ofc. but this is also 300v300 and 400v400 what do you think how many of those fights most Servers will have?
---
And then they last 30sec. More than half of the People dies. All good again.
---
It is like you guys are literally not getting on the Server. It is only a couple of seconds of lag. It is not like some1 is going to murder your Family.
---
I really don't get the Q.Q everywhere. Get a grip and get over it wtf it is only a game, why do you gotta be mad?
---
Looks more like Smite Priest with those numbers.
---
My shaman is 51, and im going Elehancement. Flametongue/frostbrand spellpower scaling and MCP. Blow all your mana on LB and proceed to play whack-a-mole with your 1sec speed MCP when youre out of mana. I wonder how this will turn out.
---
Jesus man you are seething.
---
You know classics development team is probably give neckbeards, right?
---
Uh no, they were perfect for me. You must not be an east coast player.
---
Druids don't have backstab and I believe you absolutely have no understanding of what I wrote and in what context.
---
Honestly, at a certain point people who don't like pvp need to just learn to play pve servers. Killing the opposite faction in the open world is a core mechanic of the game, regardless of level difference. If that 'drives away casual players' then so be it.
---
So what finisher you've to use?
---
*Me not that kind of orc *
---
These guys peer-review.
---
Should I **ALWAYS** prioritize healing done than stats for example? I'm talking about the Hands of the Exalted Herald and Prophecy Gloves for example. 33 healing done vs. 18 + 6mp5. Wowhead tells us that the Hands are even P2 raid BIS, but I don't know. Gloves of Prophecy have a set bonus, more stats, 6mp5 and some stats as a bonus.
---

Any potatoes will do

No changes is what I want when my druid gets mana burned in form.
---
\#somechanges
---
Especially on Ony. It literally took one 59 pala to change a wiping PUG into one downing her on the 1st try.
---
That would be the scrotum.
---
Real classic expierence. No changes.
---
Server never worked for massiv pvp (100+ players).
---
Always lag, diaconnects and sometime server crashes.
---
Probably taken. Just call them bonerfarts or something.
---
Enhancement shaman is the true support class in this game. You spend all your resources actively improving the damage output of your teammates, throwing out extra heals, interrupting casters and generally being awesome and helping where needed.
---
The difference between having a well played enhancement shaman and a 'pure dps' enhancement shaman in your raid is night and day.
---
A proper enhancement shaman grants +77 agility, +77 strength, windfury and fire resistance to 4 of your warriors. That's 3.85% crit, 154 attack power and a major increase in rage generation through windfury. Then you add the extra chain heals, interrupts, tremor etc.
---
Shaman are freaking awesome, they just have to be played as a support, not as a pure dps
---
Did you say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
So basically you thought you wanted no changes but you didn't?
---
If you’re holy you should not wear any shadow gear when soloing follows for spell power, even if you got benediction, keep it as it for the 2% crit
---
Depending on your mana pool you could easily grind/ quests with holyfire swp into smite/wand 
---
Alternatively you could consider going disc, they got sweet damage and good healing as well
---
As others have pointed out, pet Growl is not a true taunt, defined as an ability that *forces* the mob to attack you AND puts the caster at the top of the threat list (such as warrior's Taunt and druid's Growl).
---
You can easily test this in game by turning off your pet's Growl, using a couple of Distracting Shots on a mob so you have a decent amount of threat on it, then commanding your pet to cast 1 Growl. It will not "taunt" the mob.
---
You might also want to reconsider the wording you use in an argument which is hardly polite.
---
\*needs\*
---
because retail filled with kids.
---
How did you find motivation for that?
---
should be nugenery
---
Same boat, went back for a couple weeks each expansion to see if the shit show would ever turn around. 
---
Then..classic.
---
One boss three phases away. Sanc beats everything shammy bring to a raid
---
Ligma
---
There are options for dealing with this issue that don't directly involve fixing the problem though.
---
If you are options are world PvP with a ping measured in minutes or a buttery smooth match in Warsong my bet is you choose capture the flag over camp the lowbies.
---
clearly says 7 am
---
Shred = Backstab. It's the same ability different name. Dagger rogues do fine on trash, you don't. It's not because the mobs backs aren't turned.
---
At the current pace of releasing stuff we'll be at the end of TBC next week
---
Sure.
---
Now that's just stupid when we got layering and way overtuned spell batching.
---
As customer support agent, I gotta be honest though, it'll be 3 months until L2 responds and they'll just say there's nothing they can do about it.
---
the only thing i can presume is blizz are still grossly underestimating how popular classic is and as such have not devoted the server power they should be to the game.
---
Everyone states private servers as being able to handle the numbers but there are still more here than were on private servers, even if you had 100 vs 100 on the private servers that would normally 90%+ of the server pop in one place, on classic it is probably no where near that % so the servers are still having other people out and about while dealing with that 100 vs 100 wPvP event going on, i know the servers "should" be able to handle it but that is presuming blizz haven't just cheaped out on the servers thinking that people will get bored by the time the release P2
---
they need to beef up the servers and see if there is still an issue, if so then it is more than likely an issue in the code if not then it was a server issue.
---
If they announce TBC you already know what follows after and it's shit. If they announce Classic+ there is a chance for the game to last.
---
There's only like 1 or 2 brief lava runs, the rest is skating against the walls. 
---
As for the 2 runs you don't even need shields, heals, or pots. You don't take lava dmg while jumping so if you time your jumps right you can stay in the lava infinitely. Even then you're a druid, put HoTs on yourself before doing it and you'll have an easier time.
---
Since I'm not the best PvPer, going for SL + nightfall + succubus. At least I have a decent chance of surviving the encounters.
---
I just care about what insults people use, if it's a 4 letter blurred out word he could have just said fuck, shit, or cunt, twat. I need to know how triggered this guy is. Fuck the filter.
---
saying 99% of the retail content isn't challenging when you only have done 5% or so, dude it's clear you are already have in mind that classic is good and retail is bad so whatever you'll do in retail anyway you will find it bad
---
As for prices I would heavily recommend using some sort of bidding, because giving items a set price is usually a bad idea.
---
The more gear the warrior has, the more reliable he can use all his abilties. In a span of its 5 seconds cooldown an arms warrior uses potentially:
---
\- 1x melee swing, 2nd coming at 7,6sec mark
---
\- 3x sword trigger swing (obviously random and very rare, but it does happen)
---
\- 1x mortal strike
---
\- 1x whirlwind
---
\- up to 3x WF swings (not as rare as sword swings)
---
\- 1x overpower
---
\- HoJ procs
---
The chances that you will dodge one of the attacks anways with your high dodge chance is high.
---
Better to dodge all of them and eat an overpower
---
Honestly? Other than farming mats that I specifically need, nothing. I have been accumulating shadow gear and equip that when I'm farming just to speed things up a little but I stay holy/disc. Lately I sell dungeon runs for certain items and that's how I make gold because I don't have a farming alt and I don't flip the AH.
---
If this is true, thank Christ.
---
All that’s left is being reassured that classic servers won’t get overwritten if they decide to release BC. I want to play classic in perpetuity. Just classic.
---
Laughs in Maul crits
---
What you wrote was irrelevant in the first place. People are already doing more than Naxx level dps in MC. Whether the fight is 1 minute long doesn't change that. If the fight was 3 minutes long instead, their dps will be lower, but they will still be doing more than Naxx level dps in blues and MC epics. So your question didn't discredit my point.
---
Really? I have a German in my guild on an EU server and he gets reported daily to our GM for stealing peoples devilsaurs.
---
Sweet!
---
Can you even drop secondary professions?
---
Fun fact: In vanilla WoW all those items actually worked properly.
---
That doesn't explain why pservers were able to function so smoothly, since they were dealing with the same issue.
---
So you prefer going 10 times and getting nothing?
---
Why is it called invincible if we can see it?
---
Hmmm, maybe you can't. Didn't think about that possibility.
---
Woooowww what's that addon with a mini map inside the instance?
---
yes
---
I don't think your spec is optimal, i would go deep resto and use swiftmend since it's basically instant healing. Begin fight with rank4 healing touch the cast max rank reju on main tank and keep people up with rank 4 / max rank healing touch. If situation get sticky cast regrowth on lowest target and keep NS as backup.   
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0bZZxEcqeqVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0bZZxEcqeqVo) 
---
Swiftmend is so good it really saddens me to see people not using it. Keep rejuventaion up on targets taking dmg (maintank mostly), wait till theres 2 second left before it runs out. Then cast swiftmend. 
---
I could talk about this forever since i mained a druid for way to many years on private servers. But basically natures grace spec is never really viable. The thing is you relie on crit for your spec to show its worth, and without full buffed (Dire maul buffs, Onyxia and songflower) you just dont have enough crit. Especially since we only have molten to grant you gear. I tried it a couple of times with full BiS crit gear when AQ was out. Even with the idol that reduces cast time on Healing touch i couldt do half the healing i was doing with full t2 stormrage rejuvenation spam.   
---
Druids are imo the best healers in classic. Most burst healing and most overall healing if people are taking a lot of damage. Plus innervate is a free mana bar so spam that bad boy.
---
Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions. I love talking druids
---
Tbc specs, max level 60, scale gear down, reuse some raids. Just don't fucking make 90% of the world irrelevant again is all im asking for.

The real question tho, now that we've got what we wanted, when will they fuck up?
---
Jokes on you, they're both main hand.
---
The reason you made this post crying is because you're bad. Sorry to tell ya bud.
---
We have a decay, and some folk are hording their DKP for big items. 
---
I managed to pick up my T2 legs from Rags on my 1st MC run, and got my T2 helm last night, all for less than 1 runs DKP.  I dont agree in hording my DKP, cos loot drops are random, you might never get your wanted drop. 
---
In vanilla I never got my legs on my hunter. They just never dropped off Rags, and even when they did, I was out bid. 
---
I say - spend your DKP as you get upgrades, you'll eventually get the gear you need anyway.
---
Football players like messi do millions, while a neurosurgeon does not. 
---
An IT guy gets 100k, a car mechanic gets 40k.
---
Life is unfair, deal with it. Call of duty earns them millions, same does fifa for ea, basically rereleasing the same game over and over for 60€ + micropayment. Great games like Divinity Original sin  and many other indie games make way less money, despite being the "better" ones.
---
OK, zoomer
---
everybody should just need on those
---
Thanks Man, totally on your side with this. All these crybabies with "Don't release , fix bugs first" , its not that they can't do both, or wouldn't.  
---
And people complaining about massive lags on Streamer Servers like Faerline did it to themselves. Those are constantly at their limit and you should change servers .
---
Just plain false
---
You gonna try argue that mages in classic aren't the new hunters?
---
Man you really owned that bot by telling it to fuck off then re spamming it's message on other outlets.
---
They just want to do the needful.
---
i stopped reading after the first line of buzzwords.
---
most are out of touch with reddit. Reddit is a big echo chamber for certain opinions :)
---
Fair enough.
---
Yes, but there will for sure be raiding guilds who dont care about honor and will raid towns
---
This didnt end to well for some of the Fellowship!
---
Good luck keeping all your fingers and your sanity!
---
Yeah, because when everyone ninjas, no one does! Just give it to the one who needs it. If he fucks you over, just put him on your "fuck this guy"-list
---
It's the internet, everybody is entitled to have an opinion , even if you don't ask for it, or like it.
---
&gt; be surprised if it’s more than 13k.
---
It was not even close to 13k people. Please show me footage of **any** Classic server with an equal amount of people to the footage I linked. Footage were people aren't frozen, teleporting and walking in place. It certainly shouldn't be hard to find if you're correct.
---
I can at least tell you that on Gehennas EU there were considerably less people in the orc starting zone and large amounts of lag and server stuttering.
---
you could argue that loot that drops off a boss has a gold value, if only the vendor price, so why should that warrior get a weapon that i can sell on my mage for 5g? i know with things like the edgemaster's we are talking 200-300g but it is still the same principle
---
Oh, well thank you Lord Crusader.
---
Classic brought me joy again, I looked so long for a game to replace it, but no game ever could. Glad Classic is back.
---
It looks like some kind of toxin that turn living into zombie-like bodies with partially dead brain.  
---
So longer expose = bigger part of your brain dies.
---
why should they though if its an upgrade then its an upgrade for one person why shouldn't they get it?
---
with so many server experts in these threads lots of them could probably get jobs in they wanted
---
have this exact same discussion with your Guildies, and not with strangers on reddit.
---
For the most part, people are going to BRM for UBRS or MC, so said this:
---
&gt;Inside the building next to the summoning stone
---
Not a bad place, but not that hidden due to raids travelling through there to go to MC (jumping can be risky)
---
&gt;by the brd entrance at the dead end immediately before it.
---
Probably the best place, by the slavers, although you still need to turn the corner to get into MC
---
&gt;Hugging one of the arch walls that isn't lose to anything on entrance ring to the mountain.

Won't work if someone doesn't want you to get into MC
---
&gt;Like I said, it's a mountain. A big mountain
---
A big mountain with a very narrow space to get into either UBRS or MC. Since we're talking about raiding, that's MC. The only viable option would be by the slavers, depending where the dominant faction is waiting for their ambush.

How does dungeon lock out works? I can only reset 5 times per hour? If i done 1st reset at 12.00 and did it 5 times, does it mean that at 13.00 I have one run or all 5?

Holy shit look at this guys post history for a good chuckle
---
It is blizzlike. 
---
Sometimes RNG is RNG.
---
Why the fck would they Change the rate? Just to give People another Thing to outrate and cry about? Lol:O
---
Back then there were a shitl0ad of TF on my Server alone. Everything is fine. You are just looking for things to complain about.
---
Just be happy and get over it. wtf
---
Do you guys think leveling was made easier?
---
I remember back then - People took 5-6month to 60. And this time People dinged 60 after a week.
---
I think blizz changed something xDDDDDDDDDD
---
Stream page is sketchy. Maybe *cheat* you! Video game program see sketch and is sad :( Stop video game.  
---
As said, just a minor and uninformed hunch.
---
Yep! Some of the keys annoyingly like to double press occasionally, and the mouse is getting a little finicky at times.
---
We emotionally abused him and he killed himself.
---
Lava deal is a like debuff that deal damage every 3 seconds if you submerged into it.  
---
If you out of lava exactly at 2.99-3.01 interval - it won't hit you.
---
Are you actually this stupid or are you trolling?
---
Wo every Option was listed, which one is optimal for non lvl 60 chars? Its easier to get spirit gear, although +heal feels powerful. Mp5 seems Not that important since we need to Regen every 3 Packs anyway
---
Same. My very first attempt it dropped and I outrolled a level 60 for it.
---
Show them this Reddit post?
---
Belligerent and wrong. Always a winning combination.
---
I'm in the middle of gathering pre-raid bis and I'm already over 250 +healing. If you get all of it and enchant / buff appropriately, it wouldn't surprise me if you can get over 400 before any raid gear.
---
Yes, but latency is both, ping and server process speed, So when this guy says about how shitty most servers were because of the high latency he doesn't even consider internet ping. And I played on most from Europe and had nowhere near 3 second latency, so my conclusion was that this guy had a bad internet, which was the major part of his delay issue.
---
ya I'm the same way as you but I love the auto sort. just clumps everything together so it looks really nice. 
---
only thing is it always moves my thieves tools past quest items and that's weird to me
---
&gt;and there's no way Blizzard will make a competition with the mainstream wow
---
Boi what? They're on the same subscription fee.
---
only 1 run. Each lock out have its own 1hours cooldown and you can have a maximum of 5 lockout
---
Answer me this: How many other abilities do dagger rogues have not on back vs how many other abilities can feral cat druids use when not on back? Hint: the latter is one if you can't use a debuff slot (which you can't in any raid that's optimizing even at least a bit).
---
THE BURN
---
He won’t reply to your comment because he hasn’t gotten to the point in the game where he can experience good PVP.
---
Either that or he’ll realize he’s wrong.
---
Yeah computation are better now but this point still stand, modern technology doesn't solve every problems by snapping finger. 
---
Not sure why I reply to someone with insult as argument.

Reddit

During blizzcon, JAB made a reference and semi-apologies with his "you thought you do, and effectively you did"
---
Imagine caring about other people expenses
---
It the toon is inactive for over 1 month you can petition for the name in question. 
---
After that, its a waiting game (3-5 days) to get the name change approved.
---
I like them both, but I'll save my oreos for milk. Cheez-Its are good beer food.
---
Well i'll have to agree with you know. Fuck whomever got my hopes down for few weeks

I'm not your bro, pal.

🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
Our dagger rogue got CHT and Perditions Blade in 1 run by virtue of being the only dagger user in the raid. 
---
Hes a great guy, our guild recruiter and was one of our top 3 dps without them so I was super excited for him, but so few rogues seem to play dagger that idk what we will do if Another drop
---
You're out of touch with the world if you don't get that 2-3 hours a day for a hobby is already a lot.
---
If you put 20 hours/week into almost any other hobby you would be considered as really passionate: someone who watch 10 new movies/week is a movie fanatic, someone who train for a marathon 20 hours/week is training harder than 99% of the people at the starting line, someone who paint 20 hours/week is a real entusiast artist.
---
Like I said, you can consider that if someone  barely play 1 hour/day is not the core of a MMO and shouldn't complain about the game going to fast but considering people who are lvl54 with 200 hours played not caring enough? that's just ridiculous
---
You can do it with SexyMap. Don't know if there is another one.
---
I really like the DKP-system the 2nd raid of our guild uses (both raids use vastly different systems).
---
Everyone starts with 100 dkp.
---
There is bidding.
---
Ties roll.
---
DKP get replenished after each raid.
---
Each raid increases the dkp by 1.
---
Max is 103.
---
People who spent their dkp can still do a 0 bid to prevent items from being disenchanted.
---
The reason I like it is because it gives just the right kind of advantage to people who raid more often. When there's one item dropping you can outbid the newbie but when two items drop, the newbie still can get one.
---
There's also no hoarding. Quite the opposite. You are encouraged to spend your dkp as it will get replenished for the next raid anyways, regardless whether you spent it or not.
---
Gustl-Gang war hier!
---
No shit, but you aren’t any more likely to get it on your millionth cast than you are on your first. It’s really not that impressive, either you get it or you don’t.
---
No
---
You're using default frames? Most custom unit frames will let you configure all the text that shows up on top of bars, not sure what addons let you tweak default ones like that.
---
Had a hunter roll need on the + spell hit ring off Rend.  Afterwards, he said he read it wrong, lol.
---
Anyhow, it has been said: 
---
You just won't sell things at the price you want but at the price people are ready to pay . Seeing prices on other servers is worth nothing.
---
For instance, an item you think is worth 1000 gold, is only one place less in your bank till you find someone to pay that price, if able.
---
Time goes against you because the more time passes, the more money is on the market. In 6 months, there will be more people willing to pay 1000 gold for your item, but you will do less with 1000 gold than today.
---
One in the hand is more than two in the bush...
---
I mean if you are a dagger rogue and can't use backstab you move? You are energy based you can afford not spamming 1,1,1,1,1,,1,1,1,,1 every second.
---
Also they will literally spam sinister strike, just like you would spam claw, and then use a finisher move. It's the exact fucking same thing.
---
Most of those might be old news to experienced hunters but fuck it:
---
First of all you should install two addons: **tomtom** and **unitscan**
---
After installing **tomtom** you should type the following three commands:
---
/way 54 10
---
/way 42 36
---
/way 64 29
---
This will set three big green dots on your map which are the three possible spawn points.
---
But the thing that's made all the difference for me was:
---
/way 50 24
---
That's the place where you should camp Broken Tooth from (learner this from this post on wowhead). From this place you can use eagle eye to peek at every spawn point without having to waste time running up and down.
---
As of **unitscan**, simply enter the following command after you install it:
---
/unitscan broken tooth
---
And try not to die from a heart attack when your screen flashes and the air raid siren goes off.
---
And that's pretty much it. Now a bit of my experience taming BT: I honestly haven't been camping it or anything, but as I have my HS set in Kargath I made an habit of leaving my hunter at 50 24 before logging out. So I happened to log in this morning and peeked at the 3 spawn points with eacle eye and there it was at 64 29. I tamed it on Nethergarde Keep-EU on 8/nov/2019 at 8.30am.
---
Happy hunting! :)
---
&gt;because I got overkilled by 100HP
---
If this happens your guild/raid has more important problems than not using consumes.
---
So +5 nature damage is better than +5 spell damage? How? Do specific types of +dmg scale better somehow?
---
Has anyone else had issues with the stormwind quest where together you and Windsor reveal onyxia’s identity? I’ve tried 3 times now and bugged everytime.
---
yeah my guild is thinking about using DKP-system but i wonder how you should use the dkp like bids or fixed dkp-prices etc?
---
i think dkp bidding is pretty bad because then you can bid up the dkp-price and let your bidding-opponent lose more dkp when he does the last bid. then you can buy alot items cheaper after that because he dont have much dkp left.
---
any thoughts?
---
How dare we expect a game to improve after 15 years. Its not free to play
---
That’s not how math works
---
Servers are fine, maybe saw one bug in 600 hours playtime, and no reason to delay P2 further than it already is.
---
Smoll indi compani
---
Ok. Thanks anyway.
---
100% a troll, there is no way anyone is legit this idiotic.
---
Couldn't have chosen an uglier race/armor combo if you tried, be honest and show that same setup on an old model and see how awful it looks too. ;)
---
Yeah let's delay content because you can't hit 60, let the entire world wait for you to hit 60 sounds good.
---
Uhhh... sureee. I can get behind that, however, playing a game like Classic WoW, for anything less than 20 hours a week, you Will just simply not be able to achieve the things that are even relevant to phase 2, so why care if its now or in a month
---
ele shaman can solo princess, its actually pretty easy - just run circles and use searing totem + flame shock until she is dead. should work in heal spec for shamans as well, with decent + spell dmg gear.
---
The bigger the fights get, the worse warlock gets. Warlock shines in 1v1 and 1v2.
---
Shade of Eranikus in ST is a pain on a paladin. We had a VW tank it til the first sleep then tried to kill it as fast as possible.
---
Everlook transporter is faster than flying from darnassus, provided you have slow fall (though I've never had it drop me in the air, not sure if that's a thing).
---
Also how do you even reliably find songflowers? Have someone scout for them? Running around felwood looking for them on a PVP server sounds very risky, especially come next week.
---
Only thing that maybe can tweak the frames is my Lorti UI. But I've tried Luna frames, shadow frames and so on (tried all) including Real Hop Health. But none of them actually displays the hp as clean as a single digit number, it's always showing like 999/1000, I don't want the long text in my healthbar since it takes to much place. The script also, if I recall correctly show the value in hundreds, like 2.1k, 2.2k, 2.3k and so on, which is really clean. Perplexity said himself that  it's a script,
---
The reason they do it in waves is so that the ones who weite the bot scripts dont get an easier time trying to hide the program from their detection software
---
Elvui is worth isntalling just for the /rl instead of /reload
---
Appreciation? I pay for this game lmao
---
That means, Warlocks a good in WSG? But fall down in AB/AV?  
---
And then Shines hunter?
---
Are you sure it's 3? Afaik it's the same as mana/energy ticks, which is every 2 seconds.
---
Be horde
---
how many years of wow classic do I need to play to become a server expert?
---
It gives 33 spell damage to everyone in the party, which I would guess might be better than 2% crit but maybe not due to ruin/ignite
---
Yeah let's wait for content that already existed for god knows what reason. I love having a gimped version of the game with no honor or BGs sounds great.
---
I don't really swap my equipment except for a wand with higher DPS instead of my +healing wand. Deep disc with PI and holy. No spirit tap or wand spec.
---
I can easily farm any mobs 55-59 without needing to drink much (maybe every 4-5 mobs). My rotation is PWS (with Inner Focus when possible as it takes the most mana, and only on mobs that would hurt for +30% of my HP) -&gt; Holy Fire + SWP -&gt; Mind blast -&gt; 0/1/2 smites depending on mob HP -&gt; Wand it down
---
Where I farm most often is Un'goro fire elementals for Elemental fire, Felcloth in Felwood, Essence of water in EPL, Spellbinders in WPL for crusader recipe
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Don't tell me that. I am not a dev, I am not the one who is responsible for that, I am not the one who said that it would't fit.
---
Retail is so damn depressing. I was hoping for a big pvp feature in Shadowlands, but they didn't even say ONE SINGLE THING about pvp at Blizzcon. Blizzard just doesn't give a shit about pvp and wpvp.
---
Thanks OP! I've just dropped skinning to take on engineering and am going to need to switch from gnomish to goblin at some point. Hopefully I won't get caught out by this now.
---
Lava ticks every 2 seconds, at the same time as your mana/energy is replenished naturally. There are some addons that show resource ticks, you can use them to time your jumps.
---
metagaming destroys all online games eventually
---
More like 6 months the way they're going.
---
I had a priest healer that needed on my pre raid bis belt from arena.and won the roll. They said it is a healing belt because it says healing and spell damage on it..
---
Server time?
---
We got none in 7 clears.
---
Hoes mad
---
200 hundred So 20000 kills?
---
Truly pointless. Well done.
---
I was helping my priest friend farm for the Eye of Shadow on Grobb. We decided to hunt the elite demons in Winterspring, since our warlock friend also needed items from them.
---
The Eye of Shadow dropped from the first elite we killed. It dropped before our friend arrived so he didn't even understand why we were freaking out in chat until we summoned him and traded him the eye. 
---
After that we farmed for about two more hours. It was getting late, down to just me and one other person. I'd been reading about the drop rate on WoW head, people writing about farming for 30-40 hours without getting anything, so I was about 15 minutes from calling it. 
---
Bam. Eye of Shadow number two dropped.
---
Loot Council is pretty much out of the question. Makes sense while progressing, doesn't really make sense when you're just farming mc.
---
And I never said that you said they wouldn't fit. We're just discussing stuff. You told what you heard at Blizzcon, I said what I experienced on pservers.
---
Sorry for replying to your comment.
---
You don't need to be level 60 to enjoy phase 2, that's retail mentality. A lot of people are vastly overstating how bad phase 2 will be.
---
I'd say to go for the blade + orb; 21 spell power seems better than the extra +7 int and +7 spirit.
---
I think we're good for another expansion or two.
---
I keep getting older but dicks, farts and mom jokes will always be funny
---
never mature
---
High risk of abuse plus the fact that a BoE like edgemasters can pay for practically any BoE BiS item, if not several, and therefore it's for everyone to roll need on.
---
Firemaw - Black Lotus 120g
---
The best upside of shaman tanking your way to 60 is you'll usually have instant groups for anything you want to due, with the constant shortage of tanks. Downside is that it requires more skill than other tanks and you'll have to fend off morons who say you can't do it.
---
The point is that both top parses are with the all the available min maxing to those classes. Im not arguing who has better buffs. The buffs are oart of the game so it would be irrelevant if a class did more dmg than another without buff because the buffs exist and the other one can just grab it and do more damage.
---
What the... fuck?
---
Since when did people start CHARGING to run dungeons?
---
Retail really has completely changed the mindset of this game.... Between this crap, buying boost runs/gear, "GDKP", I'm tempted to just go back to a pserver.... It's a real shame classic has so many retail players, as their mindset is fundamentally different and really leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
---
Well first of all because people in the 48-59 will get farmed then because they wanted to be part of that crazy short period as an actor (so a lvl60) and not as fodder.
---
And just realize that 20/hours week is the equivalent of raiding 4 night a week (4x3) and farming 8 on top. It's waaaaaaay enough for anything but rank12-14 grind in vanilla.
---
A roll base system lead to our current raid splitting. I don't see the hassle with dkp when AddOns pretty much do everything. Why do you think it is a hassle?
---
the fact that the person would rather use them than sell them implies they have more value to them than to the others. the clue is in the names of the buttons Need and Greed, if you are needing it to sell then it is Greed you want it for unless the person is just a ninja there is no reason that people should need it over someone that will use it.
---
I don't think he gets it
---
My GL is a healer, raid leader is a dps and im MT, I got bindings. No awkwardness at all :)
---
&gt;PvP playing field uneven.
---
Oh no people with more time to play than me has stronger characters :(
---
Heyo! Welcome to the game! :D
---
Don't worry, with the current number of players, Classic won't be dying anytime soon (especially not because of Shadowlands, most people seem to prefer Classic over Retail).
---
As for what side to play, take a look at all the races and choose the one that seems the most fun to you. If you decide to roll on a PVP server, looking at the racial traits for each might be smart, but don't let that stop you from playing the way you want to.
---
I'm on an EU server (Mograine-Alliance) so I can't help you sadly, but I wish you best of luck on your journey, may your rolls be good!
---
I'm actually this stupid I guess :P
---
You want something Blizzard has NEVER delivered.
---
Even retail would Crash with those Kind of pvp battles. Now because Private Servers could do it (for 1 Server with less People playing on it) Blizzard must be able to do it too :P 
---
That is just funny to me. Because we never wanted private Server shit. But now that it is convenient for us we want this ONE exception xD
---
Get you head out of your ass and maybe you will be able to think straight again
---
The idea is most people wouldn’t have them because they’re so expensive. It’s bis yeah but so many people just ignore it because of how expensive it is.
---
Need on epic BoE’s, stop acting like an idiot
---
Getting some gear to trash you in pvp mostly
---
in classic, you do need to bounce around a lot. Zones are normally spanning 5-6 levels (sometimes higher), meaning the end quests may require you to come back later. 
---
As alliance, you should have finished all of Duskwood, Westfall, Loch Modan, Wetlands and maybe even Redridge mountains by the time you are close to 25-27.  From there, head to Hillsbrad and after that Arathi Highlands. 
---
If you find yourself running outta quests here, head over to Kalimdor to Ahsenvale.
---
i mean i never played vanilla so i literally have 0 nostalgia but i love the game
---
Statistically, no. It's 1/10000 chance 10,000 times. The chance of seeing it in that 10,000 times is something like 80ish% iirc, but it's still just 1/10000 chance 10,000 times
---
To be fair, they are at least honest.
---
Me and my friends would just invite classes that doesn't need the same loot.
---
and other fun jokes you can tell yourself
---
Yeah I get it.
---
As Little changes as possible. Is a reasonable Thing to ask for after we wanted no changes afterall.
---
I don't think that is a Problem really xD
---
Just because pservers could do it. Now blizz MUST do it too :P
---
&gt;Not a bad place, but not that hidden due to raids travelling through there to go to MC (jumping can be risky)
---
I don't think we're going to see 40 man MC raids popping up every 5 mins resulting in large scale warfare. It happens but it isn't all that common. TBH I still can't remember the last time I ran to MC using the chains
---
&gt;Probably the best place, by the slavers, although you still need to turn the corner to get into MC
---
If you have a big group you only encounter another big group as you cross the doorway. While anything is possible I'm going to give the odds of failing to enter MC as quite low simply due to the fact that enemies will see you too late
---
&gt;Won't work if someone doesn't want you to get into MC
---
Then nothing is possible...
---
You need to elaborate.
---
Everyone raiding only goes one way because of where the chains are. You summon from the other side. 
---
&gt;A big mountain with a very narrow space to get into either UBRS or MC. Since we're talking about raiding, that's MC. The only viable option would be by the slavers, depending where the dominant faction is waiting for their ambush.
---
Depends on your server pop. The issue no longer becomes people farming hks when we are talking about 40 mans. 40 man groups would go raid some major city. Far more hks to be had there. The issue is now a standard horde alliance encounter. If you are trying to enter via the aforementioned ways then you should never have to do more than 1-2 runbacks ever. Even then that would be  a high number.
---
Anyway, you could also summon on that little ledge between the upper entrance ring and the drop down to the lava immediately next to the MC entrance.
---
just become part of the problem headass
---
People seem to be overlooking the fact that this isn’t really about how good Classic is (it’s amazing), but more that Retail numbers are in the toilet and Classic adding so many numbers isn’t surprising. 
---
Add Classic during a popular expansion, with the same price plan, and you probably wouldn’t see much of an increase.
---
how does this only happen in classic? i dont get it, ive had these conversation with people in different games. Why will only it only happen in classic nobody knows.
---
&gt;\-Mana regeneration while casting worked differently. Instead of the "5 second rule" that we know today, your mana regen would stop as soon as you started casting, and resume when you finished the cast. This is why mana regen talent effects say "mana regeneration while casting".
---
Wait a second. Mage Armor says the same thing. Does that mean it is not more efficient to use in dungeons because mana regen never stops even when casting anyway? Or am i getting something terribly wrong here?
---
yep. It's quite mana intensive though, so it requires a bit of Mp5 on your gear and mana pot here and there, specially if you're also tossing out heals. That said, your mana is much better spent doing this than casting shocks and stormstrike, knocking off corruptions and other useful debuffs on the boss.
---
it would take 5 to 10 minutes to do loot for every boss. Delays caused by people mis-bidding, forgetting their dkp totals, websites not responding (guilds usually don't have expensive hosting packages).
---
I would literally go "Yay, boss down! ... Oh god, we have to do loot now..."
---
With roll + 1 (and MS &gt; OS), loot is also divided up between people, with far less hassle. I'd say we would probably use loot council for legendaries and work out in advance who gets what if it drops. It also makes things easier if you decide to bring any puggers.
---
If you have some sort of amazing dkp plugin that manages most of this for you with a low chance of abuse, then that could work out to be worth the trouble, I dunno.
---
Thank you for contacting Blizzard customer support, how can we help?
---
I would agree with this based on my servers senses. 
---
From seeing the cause, they camp in a city and are not actively lvling.
---
There play-style is not focused and they are not “power gamers”.
---
A friend of mine asked for help in leveling his toon. We have sinked up schedules for the last 2 weeks and in that time he said the biggest change he noticed was that I keeped on the move and out of the city. We were doing 4-5 quests at a time vs his 1 quest turn in, get new quest /repeat....
---
When we ran a dungeon, we were getting mob exp and setting up for a payday at the end from quest turn in. 
---
He broke off from keeping the same play schedule due to getting shifted moved at work but he said he was going to adjust and incorporate what he learned as his mew play style. 
---
It comes down to time management and focused goals.  1-60 is a big elephant to eat.  Cut that SoB up into bit size parts!
---
my point is it being a high value BoE or a couple of gold BoP doesn't stop people needing on it just to ninja it why should the rule be all need or all greed to combat this? it should be need if you need it as an upgrade, end of the day if you are denying someone an upgrade because someone in the party could be a ninja then that makes you no better than someone that ninjas an item from someone it would be an upgrade for
---
They’re rare but not THAT rare. Jump runs are a pretty quick way to get fast odds at them. Like 3 .3% chances from bosses plus a couple book spawns
---
The only thing I’m confused about is why you don’t understand, but I do. I guess it’s just 50/50, either you get it or you don’t.
---
If you go to unit frame config it would have a bunch of fields that let you customize the indicators. I'm not at home right now but it's pretty hard to miss if you scroll down.
---
Luna and SUF are mostly the same (Luna is literally a copy of old SUF code).
---
Because running a 5 man dungeon is generally awful gold per hour.
---
Mine is a healer.
---
If you are just farming mc it should be better to just main&gt;off roll. 
---
    Dkp is about fighting your own guildmates for loot.
---
Yeah its probably different on different servers. I know on my server (Gandling) entire guilds have been banned from world chat xD I have a separate tab for World + LFG chat, and you can definitely see LFG is far more active than world chat.
---
Exactly. Ill raidlog after it and get an alt finally :-P
---
It’s not really complicated. You get EP for participating in raids. You get GP for acquiring gear. Your priority is EP divided by GP. Gear has a set GP value.  There is 100% transparency and no “bidding” on loot. It’s just another DKP system.
---
If this is a semi serious question - you’re thinking *invisibld*
---
I'm just surprised that there's a portion of the classic community that is now starting the wall of no against tbc. Lovely.
---
How successful and quick are endgame dungeon runs now that the game's been out a while? I stopped leveling my Warrior when I saw a ton of posts about everyone fighting for loot, dozens of runs without their item, runs taking forever with certain groups and dead runs when people left mid-dungeon
---
Thinking about coming back to bang out blackrock/strath but I don't want to tank for groups if group quality is the same as it was on release month (DPS not letting the tank build aggro, healer heals them while I die if I don't chase the mob off them, etc)
---
As the one who organizes the run, it is fair to state the loot rules. I also avoid classes which can roll on a piece of loot I am trying to get for my guildies. We also don't invite other alchemists if we go for a flask recipe. Totally fair and culls the drama even before it happens. Saves time for the others too.
---
Since p2 announcment they fluctuate between 95-140.
---
The probability of getting it is waaay smaller than 50/50. And the probability of not getting it is 1-P(getting it) which is quite large :) Assuming that every throw is independent to get it on your 1000 throw the probability is equal to [(1-P(getting it))^999]*P(getting it)
---
Unpopular opinion: blizzard's public relations was pretty much nonexistent until mid-BC. No changes.
---
We started with monolith and it bugged out at some stage, said fuck it and went with loot council with passing on next item if you just got one.
---
That moment when you have a normal discussion and need to apologize bc you have an opinion.
---
Same
---
Next you're going to tell me I can't walk away from xbox 360 by doing a 360 turn.
---
so you are saying if you got an item that was BiS for you then you would sell it if you could?
---
I got the book for quel'sarrer drop on my warrior when i was in a guild group they all passed it as i am a tank, are you saying rather than use it i should have sold it for 1300g that it was going for at the time on my server?
---
if you want a game to make gold on and not actually progress then sure go with that mentality or go play Eve online
---
no, getting 10g from a bossdrop is insignificant while it might be a huge upgrade saving hours upon hours on the guy who can wear it.
---
edgemasters on the other hand have as much of an impact on every single class as they have on the one who can wear them.
---
you can (depending on how much you play) save weeks of gold farming and buy BIS items you need.
---
Thanks :D
---
Hopefully I enjoy !
---
You don’t get it either. I guess it’s just 50/50, either you get it or you don’t.
---
You do realize you just proved yourself wrong? 80% chance to see it after 10,000 casts. 0.01% chance of seeing it after one cast. Pretty simple stuff here.
---
May have been me.
---
They all have differnt pros and cons so it actually depends on your personal preference which of these pros you consider most valuable and which of the cons you could live with the easiest.
---
I picked druid because I highly value the pros druids offer which are insane mobilitiy/survivability, good peeling and stealth. As a nightelf I can also drink in stealth, which I think is very underrated but extremely potent when put to use.
---
Yes, thats how it always has worked for high value BoEs.
---
yeah i wouldnt do it but some people is only thinking about themselves and gonna exploit this for their benefit thats why i dont like the bidding system.
---
Haha. You’re unfathomably stupid
---
I waited till I was level 58.  Unless you are purely going to instance to 60, then no point changing early.  You cant kill anything as resto. 
---
I stayed ele till 58 when I'd done LBRS for the Ony attunement. Was easily able to heal BRD, LBRS etc as an ele shammy, with good Int and Stam gear , plus some good blues with + healing. 
---
I decided as I needed to run UBRS several times for the quests, that I'd respec then. Still struggled to get some groups and wished I'd waited till 60 to change.
---
twice the retails player base? can you show those numbers?
---
I have tried tanking in a lot of different dungeons on my way to 46 and have realized I do not enjoy it at all. Also, feels like I do not have the attention span for it sometimes.
---
Will I be doomed at 60 as a warrior if I am not willing to tank in dungeons? Off-tanking some mobs here and there in raids is fine, since that is not my main duty.
---
I have two weeks where I can grind a bit more starting today, so was thinking if I should reroll some other dps class or stick it out with the warrior?
---
How is it getting out of hand ?  
---
Dont join that group, if you are not interested.  
---
All these BS post are getting out of hand IMO
---
I'm a rogue, but got one binding so far at least
---
You don’t get it either. I guess it’s just 50/50, either get it or you don’t.
---
If they decide to keep layering rather than investing in better server infrastructure for Phase 2.
---
I Saw the compendium drop 3 times same Day. 
---
2 times in the same group. 
---
DM:E farmed my ass off to get whipvine cord. Got it after 20 runs or so
---
Do we have any official source for the sub increase from classic? I myself don't doubt it the slightest, but one of my damned friends keep saying "I haven't seen anything remotely official yet, I don't trust it".
---
I kinda wanna shove it in his face :p
---
Okay Okay, thanks for that! :) Great.. i probally forgot to say.. im more like the guy - Go In Burst someone Down..i like big burst and big crits...
---
I guess since people are sharing lucky stories I’ll tell about how I got the battered hilt in Wrath 3 times. Each pug agreed to roll need on it basically from the start since it was so valuable, so it’s not really like I ninjad it. I actually had 3 separate characters who could use it. 
---
Of course now I guess appearances for things like that are shared and all my alts can transmog it, but back in the day when I’d show up to an alt raid with my rogue holding another one of these people were like “wtf?!” And I was just like “I have 3 kek”
---
It's an osrs meme, you're getting memed on
---
 🦀🦀🦀 ActiBlizzard Jagex won't respond to this? 🦀🦀🦀
---
I don't give a fuck what their problem is. I don't bother my customers with my difficulties and don't sell them services I can't deliver. Blizzard shouldn't either.
---
Yeah, its not really that funny
---
You all still support Blizzard after what happend with HK?
---
This is false, there is a very clear line between a 5g BoE, a 500g BoE and a BoP. Everybody gets a shot at the 500g BoE, other wise its greedy as fuck to expect you get the Edgemasters because your the only warrior. Fuck that mentality and fuck it hard.
---
No - they give the same result. But +5 nature has a lower itemization cost than +5 spell damage.
---
So if you have two items of the same iLvl, one with spell damage and one with nature damage, the nature damage one will be almost twice as much bonus.
---
What are the pro's of this add-on ?  
---
Can you explain me why i want or should use this add-on ?  
---
Also it seems to me, that the data is very easily manipulated...
---
Yes... It was me 😬
---
I got 2 old crafty in like 10 casts appart
---
not once have i run this god awful rule in a run i have been on and i have never had the "pleasure" of a ninja maybe i have been lucky maybe people just know that at the moment when rep is the difference between being able to raid and not they have not been arseholes
---
None of this loot is “extremely important” and if you think you deserve it over other players doing exactly the same thing as you you’re mistaken.  Get over yourselves and play the game.
---
It’s not really that funny, no, but a lot of people aren’t getting it, which has made it incredibly funny.
---
Jonah?
---
Vote no on PvP polls
---
Pretty sure Arugal has a larger Horde presence than Alliance. Not sure if that matters to you or not? 
---
I rolled Alliance and haven't had any trouble finding groups to do dungeons or do harder quests with.
---
ingame clock shows local time by default
---
Woosh
---
Thats not really what i meant. I just meant that all top logs will have all the buffs available to them
---
they think you don't, but you do
---
Also add that GW2 used to have a super low dot/debuff cap to protect the server, and then they figured out a way to have those limits removed. 
---
Sure, there's quadratic increase of messages with amount of people but if ex-blizzard employees can figure out, then current blizzard employees should be able too.
---
He didn't. What he protested was the other guy claiming it was 1/1000 vs 1. Which is not true
---
Oh cool, just aslong as I can find people to play with tbh :)
---
im thinking of trying gnome mage !
---
With that we had people attending 7 raids and getting 2 drops and others getting 7 drops in 3 weeks. Dkp is not about fighting its about even distribution.
---
50-100g in an hour or two is bad, this is what me and a few others in guild can do running strat with random drops and orbs, running 5 mans isnt that bad it could be you are bad at it
---
If an item has a 1/x droprate and you 'roll' it x times, you always have a 63% chance of getting it by the xth roll. A good way to calculate this is 1-(1-1\x)^y with 1\x being the droprate and y being the amount of times you 'roll' on it
---
I have a lvl 60 warrior who is a tank, and in my guild we're almost always looking for DPS warriors for our raids. And if you are willing to offtank then I don't think you will have a problem at 60 if you are in a good guild. Also if you're a good fury warrior you can top the DPS-meters 24/7. If you enjoy that then I think you should grind it out.
---
100v100 is perfectly possible.
---
It is 300v300 what People are crying about. And that is just massive. Wasn't done in vanilla and is a pserver Thing which People now want Blizzard to have.
---
Unreasonable Claims by entitled People
---
Do you like being a Warrior DPS ?  
---
If yes, just continue, and dont apply for Tank spot in dungeons..
---
I gotta be honest, Nathanos was the only part of BFA I consistently liked.  (Dunno why, I just enjoy his character and find him interesting)
---
Way to kill him but leave Azerite to farm.  Nice job, dude.
---
So I'm currently speced shadow and about to hit 60, do I change to holy so I can raid and back again to shadow when I want to pvp or what's the story?
---
Either people get it or they don't. 50/50
---
Please don't ruin the no armory thing we have going, ffs
---
If you want to help build an Armory for classic where you can see other players gear, and look up your friends and guildies.
---
The Data that you upload is encrypted, so basicly you need a certain key to unecrypt it.
---
it is almost impossible to manipulate the data.
---
I don't think I do deserve anything over anyone. If I desperately want a specific item I'll ask my guild "Hey, anyone want to help me in X/Y instance I really need item Z" 
---
The difference between OPs screenshot and someone at level 60 trying to reserve an item is that the level 60 item can be BiS and irreplaceable so yes, for those who care about their gear being min/maxed there absolutely is extremely important gear. Nobody is forcing you to get said items though so don't get touchy when others try.
---
Does any LW know if the Onyxia Scale Cloak is already ingame? (as in optainable through turning in her head).
---
Im thinking about swapping out my LW for something else but im the only LW in the guild so i was hoping i could chugg out of a bunch of cloaks before i switch proffesions.
---
its just luck, would you have the same view if one of your BiS dropped and you were denied it just because someone that cant use it can sell it on the AH?
---
part of skill is putting yourself in situation to take advantage of luck
---
It's not really a matter of "how I like to play" 
---
It's most optimal to have these things macrod as a tank. So yes, I like being a good tank. 
---
If I was given an option between my Intercept going off in 3-4 seconds or in &lt;1 second, I'm taking the shorter cast every day. Am I removing stances? Not at all. I'm just incorporating them into other buttons to minimize the time I'm having to click or press a keybind.
---
Pff the private Server Videos are not lag free.
---
They only had 1 Server and easier Server structure.
---
AND IT WAS PSERVER AND NEVER IN VANILLA
---
300v300 always crashed Servers even in retail.
---
Blizzard doesn't Need to be on par with pserver - they have to be when People want them to and shouldn't be when People don'T want them to.
---
Entitled shits everywhere
---
&gt; I'd say you don't have to be Guild leader to be the main tank (or one of the three main Tanks you need for 40 man raiding) but it definitely helps because it's far better to raidlead as a tank.
---
From what I've seen, tanks are the *worst* choice for raid leaders. As I mentioned above, your view of the battle is obscured and you're simply too busy with your job.
---
In my experience, the best raid leaders are actually healers. Not only do they tend to be more closely focused on what the other raid members are doing but they're the only ones who understand the most complex part of raid strategy - healing coordination.
---
Well its not possible on my server( Gandling EU), 100vs100 in BRM and we have 10+ seconds lagg.    
---
Not only that but if its to many people onyxia head is beeing "buffed" the servers stands still for about half a minute.
---
Exactly, you get it. 50/50.
---
About the only stat weights I've seen for healing priests in Classic are on Wowhead: https://classic.wowhead.com/cloth-armor/class:5/slot:5/weights:123:61:50:24:23/weight-values:29:100:29:24:33?filter=238;4;1.5
---
That page puts the weights at:
---
* Spell power / healing power = 29
---
* MP5 = 100
---
* Spirit = 24
---
* Intellect = 33
---
And while I'm not an expert, that seems... about right, at a glance? The page also uses that to provide a score for different items (I've linked to the one for chest pieces, but you can change the filters).
---
Do take these weights with a grain of salt, though, since they don't tell you everything. I don't think they account for, say, crit chance, which isn't a priority but is certainly worth more than 0; similarly, there's at least *some* value to a piece with defensive stats. I'd probably take an item with +48 healing and +30 stamina over one with +50 healing and no stamina, for example - dead priests can't heal!
---
I played first on WotLK but here, on Classic, player interaction is just what a MMO RPG should be
---
DPS Warrior is definitely a thing. In both pug dungeons and guild raids.
---
So much so that when I /w to join a group, I'm pretty much always asked if I'm joining the group as a tank or DPS.
---
Once you get to 60 you might get more requests to tank, but that's just because that's usually the last role to fill.
---
I was 50, sitting on that mountain thing near the graveyard. After an hour, I asked for an invite to change layers. 5 sec later, I've immediately spawned on a 38 ally hunter. I bet he shat in his pants because he started running like a scared cat. Used eye on the hill on east. Well, yeah. Brokentooth was there. While running, I saw that 38 hunter is trying to fight with a random cat and brokentooth at same time. Died by himself. After aggro reset, I've started taming. Guess what, he came to me and start attacking to make me lose aggro. FYI 2-3 taming skill empties your mana pool.
---
I start to tame, he attacks &amp; I lose aggro and mana finishes after trying to tame. He starts to tame, I attack and kill him. After a minute I decided to only kill him to make him res locked for 20-50 seconds. 2 minutes later (felt like 30 minutes), he got locked and I started to tame. When I got something like %90, I saw him coming with res sickness and an another ally, lock level 60.
---
I looked at broken tooth, it disappeared. Lock hit me with 2 dots and I instantly died. Got near my corpse and saw 2 of them just waiting for me. I ressed behind a pillar. Called pet and it came. Gave a meat, mounted up, started running while /spit spamming. Lock started running behind me with epic mount. Jumped off and tried to kill me. I died again.
---
If he had killed broken tooth instead of killing me, I had a chance to lose my pet. So they deserved it :P
---
Your a mage did u mayb farm brd like crazy to get lit 1lvl /2-3h?^^
---
You'd save yourself a LOT of time by doing dungeons as a tank. With some decent gear you don't even have to actually "tank", arms is a superior spec for anything pre-raids anyway.
---
Delete pls
---
I vaguely remember warlocks talk about death coil being able to crit back in the day though
---
What are you even doing playing classic wow? Large scale open world pvp has almost nothing to do with individual player skill, but instead it is about who is the most cordinated and who is the most prepared. Just like every other group activity in this game.
---
There is a reason to why APES is beating players 5 times better than you with ease.
---
You are assuming that they don't speed up all the other phases, too.
---
But no, it's easier if you just ignore what's going on and attack anyone who disagrees with you as being a crybaby and/or child.
---
LFM - Experience reserved. You can have the loot, I prefer the levels.
---
No sense at all
---
How do you get those fixed values? There's an example formula on the wiki but following that a Staff of Dominance would be a lot more expansive than a Mageblade. Also it would not take quality into account meaning all letcs say shoulders from mc would be the same GP regardless of some being relarively bad. How do you manage that? Do you have any resources regarding this kind of stuff (I mean values etc.)?
---
I Guess those mostly interested in it would flag themselves and go to more populated areas. But that's it
---
Why wouldn't you want a armory?
---
Most likely. It happened to me too. I was lucky to win the roll, anyway I notified the healer that this is not item healer's should roll on (if any of caster dps need it). He still argued and felt entitled for the need roll cuz it was +1 int more than his green neck....
---
Its still going to be a shitshow at world bosses on PvE
---
Was just worried since I remember reading that people do not really want to bring fury warriors along for dungeons but I do enjoy DPSing as a warrior so will stick it out since I am getting pretty close to 60.
---
Thanks for the fast reply! :)
---
It eliminates all possibility of someone ninja looting, playing dumb and saying "oh I thought it was good for me", avoids new players rolling need on something that isn't actually viable for them or doesn't understand how to prioritise their stats right, stops people needing for OS or alts, the list goes on.
---
I didn't agree with it at first either, but it really is the best way to combat ninjas and noobs.
---
If I am playing with friends/guildies and something like edgemasters dropped, I would gladly greed and let the tank roll need. I just don't trust random people to honour the rolling system the way it was designed. Too easy to play dumb, mail the item off to a bank alt and sell it.
---
I'm pretty sure mine didn't but it's been a long time and I didn't play pserver so maybe I'm misremembering
---
The fuck is this thread? The mentality here is awful. "Everyone need because it can give gold". That's not how it works unless specifically laid out for that group in the beginning. You need if it's actually beneficial to use gear wise, and greed if your going to sell it. Theres no other way about it. It's why I like ff14s loot system. You cant need unless you can equip it with that class.
---
how is it false? would you tell a mage tailor they cant roll on the archmage pattern as it can be sold on the AH or a priest tailor with the truefaith vestments or a lock with the robes of the void? an upgrade is an upgrade dont be a greedy arse and let the warrior be lucky to have got an upgrade that good
---
Happy birthday, Smeagol!
---
I once saw both Dal'Rend drop at the same time.
---
Also once saw both bindings drop in the same raid.
---
Belive the impossible.
---
&gt;Lots of armchair engineers in here
---
It's 15 years later. Most of us have jobs now. A lot of us former tweens are engineers and IT specialists now with a decade of experience.
---
There's quite a few senior IT consultants playing, facepalming every time lag goes over 100 for no good reason (100v100 is not a good reason)
---
Is not a server side problem dude6. Is the game itself, no fix possible
---
Lot of folk are uptight about content that is literally no issue clearing. I wouldn't worry about it too much, and would focus more on the community of a guild rather than just raiding.
---
If you can find a guild you click with, chances are they're going to raid sooner or later. Better to be with people you can laugh and joke with than the uptight officer who demands 150% on easily clearable content.
---
lol how
---
Because it takes something important away that differs Classic from Retail. One of the beautiful things about Classic is that there are only two ways to learn about another player: reputation, or meeting them face-to-face.
---
Lol tinfoil hats are out. Low quality memes are removed to save us wasting our time on them and calling them low quality. The mod is doing us a favor 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The Hong Kong hype is almost over my friend
---
Yeah, true. Getting dungeon invites might be a bit harder for a start but im sure it will be fine in the long run :)
---
chain heals lol, the heals are so pitiful they might as well be negligible. 
---
assuming they have any mana left after twisting totems.
---
Thank YOU , that post made my day  !!!! :D all those internet know-it-alls got what they deserved
---
Every second counts.
---
yea at lvl 40 in stv not even a 40v40 battle world server crashed 3 times
---
I agree!
---
34, I'm with you dude. I don't have nearly enough time any more.
---
%\*ing
---
Or you could just ask 4 guild mates to help you quickly kill the boss a few times😄
---
So the thing is that people only really will do dungeons when they need something from them. I have been 60 for a long time now, and never really experienced what you are talking about, but if that was your experience on your server, I doubt too much has changed. There is maybe a higher chance that people will have more of their prebis than if you were playing the first week at 60, but people in general don't just do dungeons for the fun of it. They will stop once they get what they need. You are more likely to get new 60s in your groups, which will always be the case.
---
i think you dont get it
---
10v10 is a slight exaggeration but have you tried Ashran? oh its so bad
---
If they add BGs earlier i am all for it!
---
Chance on hits effect other weapons?
---
You meant everyone is entitled and opinionated.
---
I'm still farming my pre raid gear and i can do more dps than your top dps.
---
As you said even retail has those Problems. So why do People expect Blizzard to fix it for Vanilla.
---
Just because Pservers were able to do it? That is just not how it works.
---
Private Servers DID indeed have a lot of rollbacks. Especially when a lot of People were online. AH was a mess as well. It was loading forever whenever you tried to scan a couple of pages.
---
The ISP is congested. It is hurting everything. It is not just open world pvp. Have you seen an ony buff take place in SW? There is like 2mins of nothing because the Server almost crashes.
---
Just Standing in SW often times makes my game lag.
---
There is multiple issues here
---
Why did it work properly on Closed Beta? There were 80v80 fights and the servers were running well.
---
I commented basing on your explination - which is lacking. My point stands though, if you don't use this addon, you're at the mercy of others. Once again - unreliable.
---
Clintmcgurk, geiler name.
---
No offense, but 40 minutes is not the definition of "farming". To have around a day of playtime pure farming ores and not getting an arcane crystal, that's unlucky and happens a lot more than you may imagine.
---
 I believed you speak about the new event, so no haven't try it out. 
---
But I know I had lot of 20v20 fight without any lags, more than that is a shit show
---
We have encrypted the key aswell, so good luck finding that. We're software developers, we have thought about this, and we shouldn't have a security breach as it looks now.
---
And to think these whelps go for jackshit. It’s so funny.
---
Band of sulfuras.
---
lol... usually debugging is a specific role
---
Are we all just gonna ignore the fact that instead of playing with the rest you could play with the best??
---
You should have sold it because you can buy it for half that a couple weeks later.
---
Some people do level only by doing quests theres hand holding guides that you can follow for your class to keep you geared along the way
---
No. Think not. Get it. Or get it not. There is no think.
---
Some people have said to not do it in a group and it works. I am not sure how true this is since I did it in a group, but that was a while ago and it may have been before it was bugged. But people are definitely having issues.
---
Totally with you there.
---
People pretend like blizz is just chillin. They have done a fantastic Job so far with reacting to bugs and complaints.
---
Yet People pretend as if Blizzard never does anything and won't do anything in regards to this. Where is all the hate coming from?
---
I think People are just far too entitled and want everything right away - 100% perfect and for free.
---
even though the lagfree experience is completely pserver experience the People now want it in classic. 
---
But except for that - #nochanges
---
It is a joke really
---
Why the hell do you even care?
---
Respeccing to full-healer, in my case 24-0-27 from 14-32-5 before sure felt like a big restriction in my habit of going into instances as whatever was needed.
---
It is, however, significantly easier to prevent people from dying when you have Nature's swiftness and 0.5 seconds faster healing-touches.
---
Also being able to put half of my gear to the bank helps a lot in "not having to throw away half of my garbage-loot that I could sell otherwise".
---
I'm considering trying 0-30-21 and 8-11-32 too.
---
The lack of a rezz is an issue, sure. Every now and then someone has to walk who otherwise wouldn't. But I haven't had the situation that someone outright told me that they wouldn't accept a druid as a healer for lacking the rezz.
---
Just a 29 twink
---
In my raid no one else wanted it but I guess its pretty rarely in any bis lists. Seemed pretty good for spriest since mana is an issue.
---
they dont care about it since it doesnt earn them money. fixing it costs more than the predicted amount of lost money due to people quitting.
---
just look at bfa. you had those lags since the beginning during invasions. you had that lagg again in the battle of nazjatar. 0 improvements.
---
Even if there is just 2 result, does not make it 50/50
---
50/50 means the probability of result 1 and result 2 is exactly the same. Which it obviously is not. It is coded have a 1/9999 probability of the two results
---
Do damage on hit buffs from both buffs and items, such as Thorns and Lightning Shield, and  Essence Of The Pureflame (etc) work whenever a melee hit it attempted on you, or does it have to contact and cause damage? I.e. miss and dodge wouldn't trigger the damage? How does parry work?
---
I'm sorry that you didn't get the vanilla you wanted, you gonna cry now? 
---
Yes, I didn't play vanilla back in 2005 so personally I don't give a rats.
---
Lmfao I love kids like you who passive-aggressively attack other people for no reason other than to stroke your own imaginary e-peen.
---
"Omg you are soooooo bad, you only do queued content?OMGGGGG its no wonder you play classic you absolutely scrub!!!! I'm mythic+999999999999 world first bleeding bleeding bleeding bleeding bleeding bleeding bleeding bleeding edge guild leader!!!"
---
GTFO please.
---
You are EXACTLY the kind of player that is the majority of the reason that I do not play retail!
---
Yes it is
---
Then you don’t get it? I guess it really is just 50/50, either you get it or you don’t.
---
Well, i guess if someone wrote to you: " hey man, i checked your gear on classicraider, it is trash, and realized you're not updated, a normal healthy thinking person, would figure out how to update their character in there and get involved in the modern classic game.
---
Completing the Smithing Tuyere quest in Searing Gorge locks horde out of the completely unrelated Gnomeregan teleporter quest from Orgrimmar.
---
I think by this point BiS goes out the window and it should go to the person that deserves it, your guild is already farming Naxx without it.
---
Im guilty
---
My immediate response was, holy shit with these graphics and models already in place, they should be able to get this going! Nope. Nothing.
---
Anothe entitled fck.
---
How do you know bugs were ignored? Mybe they are still working on them and it is more difficult?
---
Nooo always expect the worst from blizz.
---
Those People put in 100's of extra hours for us. Letting there Family life behind and People here are still just bashing onto them from above. 
---
I would not do anything for the community.
---
Of the hunter bugs which were like 87. Only 6 or so remain.
---
Yet People do not even acknowledge the fast 81 are fixed already. No. Always just find the bad and bash Blizzard for it!!
---
Cudos to you guys! You are the real MVP's I hope to never have to deal with in RL

We use Monolith too, is there anyway to set it to not spam messages in every chat window I have. It sends a ton of messages and I can find a way to silence the damn thing. Only downside about it so far.
---
&gt;I straight up refuse to believe anyone thinks 40-man raiding is the apex of raid design.  
---
Yeah, in 40 raids at least 1\3 of people could be sitting there, and boss would still die.  
---
25 is an optimal balance between complexity and responsibility for raid member.

There's a difference between a 3g vendor price and a 600g AH
---
putting unpopular opinion in front gives more reddit karma
---
Major Mana Potion can drop from mobs. Non-mana users put it on AH, price drops
---
According to some people it should've made the mob run in different directions every few seconds, and although it sometimes does exactly just that, most of the time you see it run so far it can even reset aggro.
---
Most likely people that didn’t craft them
---
Major mana potion is quite common drop from mobs and quests.

Automated scripts that works without interaction is against TOS. Holding a button pressed is included. You can use castsequence macros but you need to press again and again.
---
They are the same thing for all spells, just different wording.   
---
Only reason that "shadow wrath" shoulders are better than Felcloth shoulders is that "shadow wrath" can roll up to +30 shadow dmg when they drop, while felcloths are fixed with only +26 shadow dmg. So it's better cuz it has 4 more shadow damage.     
---
No RNG for spells.
---
Having an armory doesn’t hurt the classic experience. This was something blizzard added that was good to the game. Just like guild banks, something that was added on in TBC, and was GOOD for the game. 
---
Just because something was part of retail doesn’t mean it’s the cause of why retail wow sucks.
---
Quel serrar is a shit weapon. Should have sold it and bought alcors. Part of playing a warrior means you need to drop 3k+ gold in boes. Why am I gonna handicap my gold gen because you're too lazy and can't be assed to farm the gold yourself. Everyone in the group put in the same time/effort into the run.
---
It's a meme my friend. You just got wooshed
---
&gt; and most classic Players will be subbed for probably a year.
---
Not really, lol. Over half of my friends list quit already.
---
THE WATERS TURNING THE FROGS GAY!
---
Hunters farm tons of those potions from soloing Dire Maul: North tribute runs. That's why the price is driven down. Supply and demand 101.
---
'good pvp' so you're the guy sitting on the level 19 twink Hunter? Or maybe you duel a lot and then proceed to cry about it because you can't adapt, you might wanna check out retail I hear it's very balanced.
---
I got mass-downvoted for saying that if it takes you more than 2½ months to get to level 60, you can't expect the game to be designed around your habits. It would be absurd to make each phase last 4-5 months or whatever pleases people who can only put in like 10 hours a week. There'd be nothing but Molten Core for the better part of a year.
---
2½ months of phase 1 is already really long, considering there's almost no new content in phase 2 (just a couple of world bosses that 0.05% of the playerbase will have a chance to kill), and can you imagine the scandal if *any* other game took this long to enable the PvP system?
---
Like seriously, imagine if a new MOBA came out today and it took 2½ months for them to start the first ranked season. That game would be dead as fuck long before then. Casual players have had an *extremely* lenient start to Classic with over two months of minimal PvP. It's bizarre to expect more than that. We always knew it would be somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 months.

Triggered? Calm down pal, it's really sad you have to affirm yourself on an internet forum for gaming lying to yourself and everybody that you have a 9/10 wife **and** be in the top 1% US income bracket.
---
Like any of that has anything to with having time to play WoW. Grow up kiddo.
---
You clearly lack an understanding of online games if you think playing for 3 hours a day isn't in the realm of casual. A bad full run of BRD can take that long or more. The nature of this game is to take large amounts of time to do anything, and pretty much everyone knows it by now. Still though, WoW was originally the casual's mmo because you could play for a few hours every day ( or more realistically some short sessions with binges on weekends/free days to do long instances) and do the majority of the content. You also didn't have to stay with your guild and fight over the server's only spawn points to do anything. The fundamental nature of WoW's genre requires a hilarious time investment, and the game is at-least partially geared to fit people who come from that whole paradigm, while also being accessible to those who don't (or can't) play it like a full-time job. This is illustrated in part by all the guilds full of 20-somethings with children who are 10/10 MC 1/1 Ony and split between raidlogging and helping newly lvled guildies. 
---
also 10.5 days? That's definitely not the opposite of casual. Someone with an actual life could manage that no problem. Also I think you have a misunderstanding regarding the importance of the majority demographic. An mmo is essentially built around the active players, as they are the ones running the different facets of the community. If you ignore the active players in favor of some other perceived majority, then you can create a feedback loop where they start leaving (or at they very least stop logging in), and then it cascades down to the less active groups as they start to feel like something is wrong. There is a sort of momentum that the community keeps going, and if it gets stopped then things start declining. I've watched it happen in real-time in another game where the team totally failed to fix bugs in endgame content, leading to everyone leaving some time around the 3rd month. Every server started hemorrhaging players, and by the time they finally did something there were only enough people left for one server, down from like 10+ initially. WoW isn't as vulnerable, but what I'm really getting at is they need to really fix some bugs, get not-shit servers, lower the 400ms spell batching, and release WSG earlier so I don't die of boredom along with everyone else who is at the point of raid-logging.
---
For EU players, patch 1.4 (honor system) came less than two months after release. People are just being babies.
---
In BG lots depends on what role you fulfill. Hunter is excellent at defending positions in general. Thats really important in AB. Has also useful roles in WSG (draining mana of healers).
---
Warlocks spread a lot of damage around and are hard to kill.
---
I dont know which one is more gear dependent. 
---
Warlocks are generally considered the "stronger" pvp class, but I think this is mostly true for Duels and 1v1.
---
Holy hyperbole batman
---
I have +4 intellect, I don’t need no rings
---
In classic (vanilla), you can roll on everything. That's why ninjas are a real issue. /PureVanillaExperience
---
Horde side : got mine from the alchemy goods seller in Org when crafting stuff early on, with rage pot recipes IIRC (small and large ones). There's probably an equivalent for Alliance in a big city ?
---
I don't talk about politics in guild chat unless its hong kong related
---
Is this aitiesh?
---
Two kinds of mages.... one gives you 80x water as you zone in and creates a portal after last boss dies. Other is a c**t. Welcome to classic friend.
---
JAMES!
---
&gt; Everyone in the group put in the same time/effort into the run.
---
so need on everything then as you are all putting in the same effort, BoE/BoP random greens and blues its all gold at the end of the day and you all put in the same effort.
---
there is more to the game than just farming gold, more so in classic than in  retail as there is less you need to spend gold on.
---
also why the hell would you value a 45dps dagger that casts fireball, great proc in MC btw, over a 52dps sword that has stam and chance on hit to increase armour and defence, i know what one i would go for.
---
and no playing warrior doesn't mean dropping gold on kit, you can easily farm the BoP items you need and while the BoEs are good if they drop its not the end of the world if you don't have them.
---
i have spent 0 gold on BoEs, i have been lucky to get Quel and i am more than capable of tanking everything currently in game.
---
the only thing i would debate spending gold on is edgemaster's but i can also wait until it becomes an issue me not having it.
---
stop trying to justify why you "need" gold when you don't
---
The BIS lists can be helpful if you have no feel for the stats, but in the end they are not set in stone for any situation and playstyle. Usually you are good with around 400+healing (more is better) and then start using lower heal ranks to get more heal/mana.
---
As a rule of thumb you can do something like 3.5 heal = 3 spirit = 1 mp5 = 10+ int
---
So 1 mp5 is a lot more valuable then 1 heal. I'd value 1 spirit lightly over 1 heal.
---
Stamina is a plus, and not a unimportant one. Especially on MC trash you might be oneshot very often without additional stamina. Also it helps to survive some random bursts on specific bosses. Thats why full green +heal gear is not a very good idea, while strong on the pure healing side of the spectrum.
---
Now for the playstyle: If you just spam your 1kheal no matter what, mp5 and heal (to downrank) far excells spirit. If you go for very big heals but cancel them very often spirit shines, as you often go out of the 5sr. I think there are addons to track this to find out what works for you. Then when you mostly dispell again mp5 or spirit help more then heal. And finally you could even top the raid with lowranked renew spells, even though noone seems to suggest this as it needs a lot of coordination between healers. Renew rank 3 has one of the best heal/mana ratios in the game when having proper +heal gear.
---
You can follow BIS lists and you will be fine. But to be good and make individual choices or priorities understanding how everything works together helps a lot.

^Undead Rogue
---
He just deciphered language code
---
I just want horde paladins
---
Yeah totally, but it's nice to see him at least acknowledge that maybe he was in the wrong on this
---
Of course, my source:
---
retail bad
---
classic gud
---
I would like to try holy/reck, but I just love holy shock too much. It’s great for PvP and it also has more use than you would think in PvE. Because of spell batching you can cast divine favor with a holy light and if you spam holy shock at the end of your cast then both the holy light and the holy shock will benefit from divine favor. So it’s great for topping of two targets at once and you get all the mana back.
---
You can also pvp as a healer. Find a warrior friend. There probably is a pvp healing spec out there that performs reasonably in raid aswell.
---
But yeah if you wanna pvp as shadow (and also solo farm stuff), many priests respec before/after raids.
---
Your addon violates the second point of the [UI AddOn Development Policy](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1021053914).
---
We have encrypted the code aswell, but yes it will always be possible, but we have made sure, you really have to put your effort in to be able to do it. 
---
Try to download the addon and look through the code :D
---
I spend 4 days trying to finish quest with Bolvar, because people where doing Windsor quest and it somehow bugged again and aging)  
---
It definitely happen often.
---
DM tribute stealth runs drop a lot. With 2 druids and a rogue you can get over 20 pots per hour just as a side bonus
---
C'mon. He needs to upgrade his "mend pet" spell so it would not miss.
---
Getting your casts "sniped" is only a bad thing if you're trying to game the meters.  The meters currently only show who's spamming themselves oom as fast as they can.
---
In any non-trivial encounter, ie. lasting more than 1-2 minutes like 40 man MC right now, "getting your casts sniped" is a good thing, it lets you hit into your 5 second rule and get the sweet regen flowing.
---
MC is terrible right now for teaching people bad habits.  A lot of flash healers are in for a shock once content comes out that is appropriate for our gear level. 
---
Anticipation, pre-emptive casts, and cancelling when they're not required is what gives you endurance in long fights.
---
This is really helpful. Thank you.
---
Server?
---
preach.
---
&gt; Classic+ is 100% sure
---
Just lol.
---
yes a number, there is a difference between 10s and 6g as well but would you agree that someone should need on a 6g 2h axe over a green? its a pointless argument to go "well its a higher number" you dont "need" 600g you "want" 600g
---
Yeah we had such mistake happen once, a mage didn't need a ring from a boss after double checking his gear and wanted, to give it to us, but couldn't trade it anymore :/
---
I'm not your pal, buddy.
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
yeaaa right...
---
If you wanna do damage reroll warlock. Not worth playing shadow
---
False. I had my greater fireprotection potions show up and always used them out of combat
---
Right because splitting the playerbase and killing every server is a good idea. .
---
It looks like you read only the first half of the text. Immediately i said sorry didnt mean to hurt his feelings. I was just curious. And by the way, the way you wrote your text what makes you different of a jerk? :) i wanted to discuss this as modest as possible. Im not a small kid. I can confess myself if i was wrong. Thats why i made this post to make me clear if i was wrong or not. You just come to tell me how bad person am I. Anyway thanks for your time that you have taken to read my text.
---
Lol its a Hunter weapon ;)
---
You are right, I don't *know*, I just presume because it's the common pattern to have separate product and maintenance teams of developers in bigger companies. One of reasons is actually to not have delays in new releases just because of bug fixing :)
---
Shit. Well, always a risk here on the interweb
---
O ya well I caught a pair of dentures IRL!
---
Is it worth it to level both Elemental/Tribal and Dragonscale on my druid and hunter respectively?
---
I’m a fairly casual player, not much into raid, but rather looking at pvp in end game.
---
&gt;"I just find it strange that someone levelled to 60 with only quests"
---
That's what I'm planning to do with my alt warrior. Warriors are the worst class to level, every quest is precious. Will dungeon only when I get all quests for it.
---
The code is visible, i don't understand what you mean? 
---
it is just encrypted, it is still visible, you just don't understand how it works?
---
Classic plus not even Blizzard would be that stupid and release new gear new raids into Classic.. Isnt Naxx powerful enough? Imagine Warriors critring 10k with Heroic Strike
---
best way to fix bugs is to release TBC :-D
---
This is a spelladin/shockadin build that I’m running knowing fully that it is not optimal, but it is very fun. So I agree with what you are saying, I just love that stun, holy shock, SoC and HoW burst damage, it’s so much more fun than any other paladin damage build.
---
I also needed on that. Way better than what I had and I hadn't started running BRS yet.
---
Low quality bait mate. Let me put it different because the probability above is the probability to only catch it on the 1000th throw. But what about catching it atleast 1 times in 1000 throws? 
---
* From wowhead the probability of getting "The 1 Ring"  by fishing in Stormwind City is equal to 1/6490. This means that the probability of not getting it is equal to 1-(1/6490) = 6489/6490. So the random variable of catching the 1 Ring is bernoulli distributed. If we repeat the experiment of trying to catch "The 1 Ring" 1000 times (i.e fishing 1000) this is equal to a sum of 1000 bernoulli random variables which is equal to a binomial distributed random variable with parameter n=1000 and p=1/6490.   
---
If we call this random variable X we say that  *X* \~ Binom(n, *p*) where n and p is as written above
---
* We can now find the probability of getting atleast 1 catch of "The 1 Ring" in an experiment of fishing a 1000 times by calculating: F(1; 1000, 1/6490)=Pr(X&gt;=1). We simulate this probability by repeating it 100000 times  and get that Pr(X&gt;=1) = 0.14226.   
---
So if you fish a 1000 times in Stormwind City the probability of getting "The 1 Ring" at least 1 time is equal to 0.14226. GL HF
---
No one makes those comments lol. The people that came back only did so for classic, not the garbage that is retail. If after a few years (which btw is such a long time it is definitely not part of the strategy you are proposing), there is no TBC, people will just keep playing classic and reduce their playing time. Retail is a different game that is only World of Warcraft in name, but is a travesty at best.
---
Nice
---
No it doesn't
---
I guarantee you thst shadowed unit frames can display health, your own pr others, as # instead of #/#. Go to player frame and in one of the last tabs, forgot its name, you have hp bar and power bar, each having 2 options: left text and right text (you can also create as many texts as you want). Each tezt has a lot of cuatomization, like size, position, where to show it on the frame as well as x and y position. When you click the text that you want to customize you also have like way over 50 things that you want that tezt to show, can also combine multiple options. Here you choose to display health as # instead of #/#. For example on my targets power bar, in the left corner i have level (multiple options i use the one that colores the level based on your level) than targets classification (boss, elite, beast, humanoid etc). Infinite customization considering i've used like 6-7 display text options and there are way over 50 for whatever you may want to display on whatever frame like target, player, pet, pets target, party, raid and so on.
---
yeah, i dont like Duels.. i just wanna play BGS ..and Burst someone Down like no one..like Aimshot/Multi-Shot combo or ..Soulfire/Conflag/shadowburn.. i would never play SL let me say..
---
Well yeah and between queues and during dead hours rankers will be out ganking.
---
Ah sorry, traffic had trickled to almost none outside of bots after this post slid further down Reddit. I'll bring the instance back up and look at my other things running in AWS for savings. Should be back up at the original URL
---
Thats what i tried to tell him. I even said i wasnt meant to tell him his a “noob” or something like that. Furthermore i highly appreciate anyone who level to 60 with only quests.
---
What's your point? So people go back to retail? And? Oh noooo blizzard are still getting our money!... They same sub pays for both games so who cares?
---
Can we get the next lottery numbers please?
---
This is not funny, Candice is the name of my sister who died of Ligma
---
[laughs in hunter]
---
Just brought the instance back up, traffic had gone to pretty much just bots over the past few days so I took things down looking for AWS savings
---
Make pots that don't drop of anything and everything.
---
&gt; horror of the P2
---
This sub is filled with care bears, even most the people playing on pvp servers here are care bears.
---
I disagree, I feel its less greedy that everybody gets a sot at high ticket items. To expect to get something with such a high AH value just because you you can make use of it, is by my view greedy has fuck. I would blacklist somebody from my list if tgey acted so entitled.
---
“Rogue was a jerk. Warrior might having a bad day” sorry but i dont understand this part of your text. Thanks for your time btw.
---
Yeah been doing that on and off :)
---
We aren’t even talking about The 1 Ring, we are talking about the Turtle Mount in WOTLK, so you definitely don’t get it.
---
Some random player tried to pull this on me earlier, bet he saw this post before lmao
---
Get itemrack, set up different gear sets, it really helps.
---
I usually go with a mix of shadow and dmg gear. Opening with Holy Fire, SW:P,  then depending on the mob MB or wand it down. Shadow ward from troll helps a ton!
---
ah makes sense
---
You can say jerk on the internet man, it's okay I swear I won't tell your mother.
---
Please don't start this kind of attitude. Let's just enjoy what we have for now.
---
talking about reading propperly - there is no Spell hit ring in the game currently :P.
---
There’s no way you could know that unless you’re the mage lol. I’d like to think he thought he was saving the war from npcs then realized his mistake and just ran lol
---
If you havn't casted for 5 seconds, you will begin to regen mana again. That won't stop untill you complete a new cast.
---
I would prefer it delayed either way
---
I farmed for the Tiny Crimson Whelpling. I killed ~30 and got it to drop. Decided to go back and farm for leather, it dropped again within ~20 kills. One for me, one for the AH :D
---
People who came back for classic are mostly people who left due to retail changes, why would we go back
---
you asked if i would still hold the same view and i said yes, i do.
---
I agree - I just feel like everyone is assuming that something will come next. That’s a recipe for a spiteful community. Trying to manage expectations.
---
I don't think there is a dutch client.
---
I, for one, probably will, yeah. Majority of my friends list and guild aswell as far as I know. If it's not utter crap, that is.
---
It’s a little too late to start acting dumb.
---
I often help hordies, when they get ganked 2v1 or 3v1
---
its exactly the same 500g is a number that someone as decided to sell that item for that someone has decided to pay, i wouldn't complain is edgemasters dropped when i was on my mage, who is my alt and my main is a warrior tank, and it went to a warrior tank as thats fair. same as when i got Quel on my warrior the mage in my party was an alt of the guild MT and he passed as he said its not right to take it off a tank that is there for his that is not, i think people really need to learn what is fair and what is not, 
---
this is not and insult, but you need to think about the fact its a game you are so hell bent to acquire so much gold in rather than letting someone improve their character in the same game needing something to sell over someone that needs it there and then is a dick move and pretty shitty on the person that just wants it as an upgrade.
---
It was easy with the fishing raids. Doing it alone sucked. But you would find a raid at any given time so it was not that bad. Same with the Legion floating island.
---
I have never played WoW but I want to give it a shot.  Where do I start?
---
Fast weapons are infinitely better than slow weapons for tanking. As a maintank if you're not dropping gold on consumables and boes you won't be able to hold aggro over a dps who is min/maxing with maximum effort. These are the good players that you want in your guild and they will leave if they have to hold back for a guild that will let them go all out. In classic consumables add more damage to your character than your entire gear set. Because of this fact gold becomes more valuable than any items you're wearing and always holds weight. You don't need on random bops because most of the time nobody is needing on them anyway and you're all gonna greed roll regardless. It's not a black and white issue and trying to compare it to some noob need rolling on every drop is silly. Warrior is the best class in the game because of the insane itemization provided to them. If every class had the same amount of powerful boes warrior would be much lower on the totem pole. Not utilizing these powerful boes is actively gimping yourself and your raid group. When you play in a 40 man and you're not putting maximum effort in you're wasting everyone else's time because you can't be bothered to farm.
---
You can tank anything in the game in greens as arm spec. All that matters is threat. Quel serrar is awful if that's your goal. You seem like a type of player who expects to just walk into every raid and succeed. I think you're gonna face a rude wake up call in AQ when you begin to hit a brick wall and people start quitting your guild and you can't replace them.
---
Lol u dense
---
Total probability, obviously. If you fish 10,000 things the probability of one of them being the thing you want is higher than the probability of having it in only 10 things.
---
Same and it's infuriating. They swear by the process, no intelligence involved .. kinda rough whzn you know how IT works
---
What do you mean?
---
It will be like dota at the end we will just do WSG and log for a few BGs but this will be far far in the future...getting a T3 set will take tons of time maybe only a few will get them. We will see
---
Im new to reddit and dont know the rules about filthy language. :D
---
Absolutely wrong. If you think blizzard just spent years working on tools to let them easily import old data only to not rerelease their two most popular expansions you are out of your mind. Tbc and wrath are a certainty at this point.
---
Wait , you can turn it off?
---
Vedra had enough
---
But you’re better off just selling the herbs on the AH if they sell for more than the pots you craft with them. Yet, a lot of people don’t take this into consideration if they have both herbalism and alchemy.
---
for PvE servers its nothing. But PVP servers, going to/from BRD could be an HK farming mess if you dont go grouped. If a guild are farming HKs, then it could be a battleground to get to the instances. 
---
same with the world bosses added. 
---
However on a PVE server, its business as usual.
---
You got 44 thorium in 40 minutes?

If I farm Un'Goro - Silithus I'm lucky to see 10 thorium in 3 hours.

why is it that private servers can handle these LARGE scale wpvp events but not official blizzard servers??

---
I can't imagine I would keep playing if it's like six months before the PvP system comes online. In what other game would that be remotely acceptable? Imagine if Riot launched LoL Classic and said "oh hey it's gonna be six months before we add ranked play."
---
Yeah, extremely large-scale PvP is kinda fucked and it would be nice if it wasn't; but we're only really talking about 100v100 and stuff like that. 40v40 has been fine in my experience, the problem occurs only when there's multiple raids on both sides. That's a pretty isolated issue. How often do you really get involved in that type of PvP? And when you do, were you really gonna make any crazy plays that mattered? 
---
Mass PvP is just sapper-spam anyway, and while it would be ideal to not have lag anywhere, the game is smooth as butter 99.99% of the time. If huge battles between four raids become a lost cause, we'll have lost the least interesting and least common type of PvP. It's not the end of the world.
---
I don't see the point of delaying the entire PvP system just because there's a problem with one niche facet of it. What would that help? If they can fix it, they'll fix it when they can. If they can't, is there just not going to be an honor system? Delaying it would serve no purpose. It's like if a restaurant took all pasta off the menu because one of its ten pasta dishes tastes bad.
---
Is DSGVO conformity of this service established?  Because if a european citizen complains about his data being gathered against his will, there very well could be fines.   That said, where can I contact you to opt out of the service for my account?

I thought the random was weighted? Your chances increase every time. Resets when it drops. Almost no game is truly random. There's a video out there somewhere but I'm at work so can't search easily. I'll try to remember later

---

---
idk about you but the last time I talked to people in a Dungeon was around 2012 - thats why.
---
Like really?
---
Do you people really think that all assholes just go to particular servers?
---
I got news for you man. Every game as assholes, every realm has assholes. Stop thinking that for some reason classic only attracts to saints and that all assholes are directed to "streamer" realms.
---
&gt; It doesn't say anywhere that this is the highest number. It says the highest quarterly increase, there is no indication that it's highest number of subs ever.
---
Exactly and we don't even know what to make of it.
---
BFA has tanked super hard, imo the worst expansion ever, the highest quarterly increase might as well be from 2m -&gt; 5m which is 40% of wrath had consistently.
---
Optimizing strategies... They're all optimized already. And it's good to see who to bring to a raid for a certain piece of loot, who has enchants, who has pre raid bis etc. 
---
This is a third party website, very little this "minority of guild leaders" can do about it. These things also existed in vanilla already. This doesn't affect u in the slightest.
---
Chat timestamps show local time , it was 4AM Server time. you can check screen i posted above
---
Classic + would likely be a sprint towards what made retail meh instead though.
---
Hilarious of you to just keep killing them over and over lol. 
---
Also, the nameplates on the alliance characters are nice.
---
Classic Aura Durations if I'm not wrong
---
not a chance. I quit when Cata was released. The game have changed completely from what I fell in love with. 
---
I came back for classic and happy to stick with classic only. I dont want tBC, or Wrath either.
---
Do mage things?
---
See above : retail will make them more money.
---
Target few yards away.. nothing in my way.. tree in the left..

Didnt know u can turn it off :(
---
Shadow is good in pvp, what are you going on about.
---
Gandling-EU , wbu
---
Actually, I’m not. The likelihood of getting it on any particular cast is the same, unless Blizzard weights the drop rate based on failures.
---
you are making a lot of assumptions just because i rate quel over alcor's, i never said quel was the best just that it was ONE of the best at the moment, alcors is not great for current content outside of dungeons, as a guild we are having no issues with treat at all from our tanks with our DPS going all out from pull, having some of the fastest MC clears on the server at the moment with DPS Min/Maxing.
---
also said i'm not dropping gold on Kit i am using consumables but i spent about 20-30g on a few weeks worth of consumables on the server i am on. if its costing you 3k then your server prices are a little off.
---
also having cleared all bar naxx in vanilla when it was current i am more than aware of the "effort" needed. 
---
fast weapons are only good for Rage if you need it, if you are tanking in greens as arms spec trust me rage will not be your issue, once you have rage sorted you need to be able to combat the treat caused by the DPS, guessing you are a HS&gt;Sunder type of tank, if so i think you will find you are the one that will have people leaving your guild come AQ40, you are much better have an good speed, not 1.3 nor 3+ speed main hand and then using sunders to keep threat and HS as a rage dump when you are generating too much.
---
dont presume you are some god of tanking because you watched a few pserver videos that said DW daggers is the way to go, Pserver numbers have been proven multiple times to be wrong
---
Nope, it is classic. They're in retail so go play over there.
---
Even handier way, is just to remember that it'll happen or not, so its 50/50 if you get it or not.
---
&gt; Building a server for Classic isn’t just a matter of whether or not it works. 
---
Sort of. They could have rebuilt the server side for Classic from scratch but they didn't want to do that for logistical reasons. So they stuck the old data into the new engine and made it work. 
---
WoW could never deal with large numbers of players in one area, as seen most prominently with the complete clusterfuck that happened during the opening of the gates of Ahn'Quiraj. Post Vanilla development also never focused on adressing this issue, choosing instead to instance the game more and more. Thus, the modern infrastructure and engine are still not designed to handle large amount of people in one area.
---
It would take a complete overhaul to allow smooth and optimal gameplay.
---
After 20 weeks of full clearing naxx that's probably not going to matter.
---
He's just australian, stop being such a cunt.
---
Maybe if you read one more sentence deep you'll see why. I have years of exp in datacenter architecture and I know that there is no way to speculate on the source of this issue in an insightful way because nobody here understands the application architecture at a level that's meaningful. Anybody that does have experience like mine or greater can tell you it's not adding more fucking hardware though.
---
\#nochanges baby !
---
No, a certain type of player base makes more money. That player base is not on classic and switched to classic because they're not that player base. I won't be back for retail as I haven't played retail since cata.
---
Your purpose maybe. Not mine, and frankly most people playing classic atm never played vanilla, just private servers if at all. Deal with it.
---
I would love to hear your definition of a good tank.
---
Macros have nothing to do with being a good tank, so yeah, it's a matter if how you like to play.
---
I'm not sure how you got to a choice of: A) Instant intercept, and B) Intercept going off in 3-4 seconds.
---
I'll give you that using a macro will let your intercept go off instantly, but manually clicking on berserker stance -&gt; intercept is almost instant too (it's clicking 2 buttons instead of 1). I really don't see the big difference here, and especially not where the 3-4 seconds come from. Also, since we're talking about intercept: The time it takes for a mob to run to a healer (or the dps who pulled aggro or whatever) is more than enough time to reach and do it manually.
---
Maybe unpopular opinion but to me attacking another hunter who's taming a rare is the lowest of the low, period.
---
During those 20 seconds all sorts of things came to mind. "What if I dc?" or "what if an asshole shows up and kill my mob?", to name a few. Congratz on your pet, you totally deserved it after such a thrilling experience!
---
&gt; scans a player, it calls a method, that encrypts the data
---
you sure? I see the point where you see the unencrypted data, it is the point right before you encrypt them lmao
---
It’s 50/50, either you get it or you don’t.
---
This...
---
And thanks to the OP for his insightful thoughts...
---
Anyone cares????
---
There is nothing like this, Since You dosn’t own the data, all the data in wow is own by blizzard, and blizzard is not a EU Company therefore DSGVO is not valid
---
"this is not our destiny"
---
"Times change"
---
What's there to advance? Afaik most people are clearing MC in \~2 hours in all blues.
---
Yeah but nobody is trying to get it exactly on 10,000. It's a cumulative increase in chance that by casting it 10,000 times versus 1 time there is 10,000x chance that you will get it BY 10k.
---
I just ignore kids flaming my reserves lfm world msg, saves even more time and doesnt exclude people!
---
I'm more concerned about the numbers rather than the priest being there. I do +450 dps on ragnaros with my sp.
---
&gt;You can also pvp as a healer. 
---
Yeah, but they don't actually want to pvp. They want to see big numbers.
---
You're so wrong it's embarrassing. Tbc was more popular than the last 4 expansions and the work is already done lol
---
Bfa is shit, the new expansion looks shit. I’ll play classic until it expires and move on with a totally different game.
---
I think this is very server-dependent, but in ours, we (Alliance) are vastly outnumbered at 60, which means that you can encounter 3-4 different raids on the way to MC on a Wednesday night. Sometimes a group of 10-15 of us hold BRM (Searing Gorge entrance until the chains) and it's amazing the constant drip of Horde players coming in. Last Tuesday, from 22:00 to 23:00 server time, we killed around 55 different players (according to an addon), most of them going BRD/UBRS. Sometimes they already came in a raid group. 
---
That's why some of your suggestions won't work based on the experience on our server, especially on Wednesday/Thursday.
---
Please don't confuse vanilla/classic with pservers. You are typical pserver player and nothing else.
---
"this" was a change made to spell-coefficients in WotLK, so it doesn't apply to classic.
---
Completely agree. Its so strange that people prefer this..
---
I'm still not 60 (57), so this is fine with me.
---
Your wording is strange.... consult a bis list.  You will easily get into the 500s as you start to get mostly BiS.
---
There isn’t an increase of chance. It’s 50/50; either you get it or you don’t.
---
Many people people spent many hours with no luck getting it. It’s still significant that it was his first and only.
---
Thanks I've been waitig for something like this!
---
It's fine. Im not even lvl 60 on my main.
---
The short answer is: as much as you can get.
---
I didn’t really check any guides or something, but as a Druid in Mc I started preferring mana and mana reg once I got around 450+, it just feels more worth it at this point
---
I never understood this retort. If you accept the premise that the company doesn't give a fuck about it's playerbase, why are you surprised that they don't give a fuck about the one's with valid complaints.
---
Not really, it’s 50/50. Either you get it or you don’t.
---
So you're just playing a game and don't care about no changes?  Great then why don't you want bugs fixed if no changes isn't your excuse?  See this is the problem with goalpost moving the more you move it the dumber you look.
---
There's an increase in likelihood that if going into fishing you will be throwing 10,000 casts rather than 1. Yes.
---
Classic + will never happen, get that fantasy out of your head
---
That was fixed I thought?
---
BRE is 100% better.
---
hehe yeah thats what i do :D
---
Agreed, I can’t help but staying out fishing all night.

I had Sexymap for a while and it doesn't do that on classic.

What software developer doesn't know about GDPR lol. Usernames are PII and can't be harvested for purposes like this
---
There is a very good discord for warrior and the first question in the FAQ list is:
---
Q: When should I respec to Fury or Prot?
---
A: 5 mins before the first raid, since arms is far too superior in dungeons and open world.
---
That's probably right. I only played fury and protection warrior in vanilla. I never played any other class or spec.
---
You’re welcome!
---
There is a reason groups selling runs is actually a good idea.
---
You are a rogue - you can easily pickpocket farm 40g/hour in BRD.   My server, there are guilds selling Dal Rend runs for 200g, when it drops.  
---
I bet you've spent more than 5 hours just finding groups and getting everyone assembled. 
---
It does suck to lose those rolls, but it is all statistics.  It will even out in the end.
---
My first guild abandoned me on stalagg the first week. I was Into the 30s so I didn’t wanna reroll. I wound up transferring apart from the guild I did some raiding with because of the Imbalance

Classic its challenging, u fell your character becoming stronger 1 step at time
---
lvl 1 - You are afraid of darkness
---
lvl 10 - You learned u can fight back
---
lvl 20 - You learned a way to fight back
---
lvl 30 -You learned to fight back
---
lvl 40 - You become a low class fighter
---
lvl 50 - You become a high class fighter
---
lvl 60 - You start "flying like a butterfly and stinging like a bee"
---
\[BOOM\] - Retail
---
lvl 61 - You kamehameha shit out of your sight
---
Well yeah, I prefer it to include some level of skill. Not just who has the least amount of life.
---
I also quit shortly into Cata (stayed a few weeks to confirm my fears). Some people in classic are trying to get me to go to retail when Shadowlands comes out, and I'm just not interested. I'd be fine going back into TBC, but if they don't, I'll just quit playing altogether and move on with my life, like I did after Cata.
---
You don't actually "need" anything in this game. Also, how are you seriously going to compare needing on BoP and BoE drops? BoE drops can be hundreds of gold, aka hours of farming for gold/playing for gold whereas BoP will only be a vendor price and be minutes of farming. It's ridiculous to compare ninjaing the two. If you ninja a BoP for vendor gold, you're an asshole. If you "ninja" (in your opinion) an item that sells for 500g, then you're getting your own BiS that sells for 500g. It's a chance for anyone to get a very good piece of gear.
---
If I were with friends it might be a different story, but likely not either because we all have the same mentality. And chances are, a lot of people end up selling these BoE's anyway because they just find an alternative that is good enough and they'd rather have gold for something else.
---
&gt; You know there are separate teams working on bug fixing and new features, right?
---
&gt;You are right, I don't know, I just presume
---
nothing stops anyone from ninjaing though if they want something bad enough. whether its an epic or a blue drop. I mean we  might as well just throw away all lot rules and roll need on everything if your entire argument hinges on the possibility of a ninja.
---
Toyota gorolla
---
I guess Lasher Farm or duo jump runs in DM:E
---
Thank you for actually reading and processing my post. Everyone else in this thread is on defensive mode in a bit of denial.
---
Separate servers is by far the worst idea. Then we'd have retail, classic, BC, WOTLK. Who is going to play on what server? If you thought it was hard to find a group or play with your friends, it's impossible now.  
---
If anything, releasing the good parts of retail but with a classic touch may be a good idea, but IMO a totally new experience is the way to go.
---
True but the problem has a solution. Not saying the solution is more hardware, but there IS a solution.
---
More hardware is very often a panacea for performance issues. It can solve pretty much any software issue.
---
And that's the point. Most of us have had a server running at some point. We might not understand the intricacies of a WoW server but still ... if someone as unqualified as me can get a linux NAS with redundancy running stable, IT professionals should be able to keep their WoW server running. You could, given your level of experience. I'm just a senior PLC programmer, I only have tangential knowledge of servers. If blizzard gave you the hardware and time to implement, you could run a server as smooth as my child's skin.
---
And just like most of us have learned through trial and error, more hardware is a panacea. If you don't get the resources to solve the software issues, just add more hardware. It's very clear the issue starts happening in large battles, more RAM isn't just a random obsession, it's the correct solution in 90% of similar cases we've all solved in our life.
---
It's either that or bandwidth. But the problem can be solved given the correct resources. I don't think that's up for dispute.
---
It's either that or we all have to admit that blizzard just isn't qualified to develop online software.
---
Could be worse, you could get stuck in the wall or just run straight into it lol at least you make it to your target in the end
---
HAHAHAHAHA.
---
Allow me a rebuttal:
---
Fuck you.
---
Aww yis! preach brotha!
---
That was Fallout 3 tho?
---
Yeah, costs 100g per raid basically. Farming as shadow is a lot more efficient though, so if you play enough it's worth the gold.
---
I macro the party rules so we all have an understanding at the start of the run
---
World BoE: All need. If its an upgrade, need. 
---
I dont really care what others think. If they dont like it, they can drop. Its fair as we all get a chance at the drop and have found lots of folks appreciate this type of stuff being clearly posted at the start of a run/raid. 
---
To answer one of the above, if the green is an up, hell yes. As thats what I expect/req they do from the others in the group.
---
Well playing 3h every day is pretty much. When youre working full-time and living alone/with your gf and have some other hobbies like sports even 1h per day is pretty much.
---
It's mostly about a proof of innocence and not the money
---
I mean the sole reason why we have spellbatching atm in the game is because the idiots in this subreddit.
---
Then the same people who wanted SB crying about it here.
---
No one who knows about this game or is passionate about it dont use this wicked place for nothing more than browsing when they cant play.
---
This shithole has far too much impact on the gaming industry we are experiencing at this very moment. Best thing for future of classic wow is to get rid of this sub and create noice proof echo-chamber for those "gamers"  who share their opinions about content release etc.
---
Your opinions are ridicilous  (im not talking about the op)
---
Sencirely yours,

Same here. 5/5 in Furor and Wolshead is great. For tanking I use Embrace, Warbear, Devilsaur set, and Tooga ring. Cannot wait until I can run DM Tribute and get Unyielding Maul.
---
My Question is the same but also with [Hand of Righteousness](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7721/hand-of-righteousness) in the equation. Rod, Blade+Orb or Hand+Orb?
---
damn dude that sucks.
---
Probably, i just haven't used win10 in the last 6 years for anything but open a very few text documents which looked wierd in LibreOffice. 
---
As for my previous comment, I dont think i meant to direct it at you. i think it was mostly directed to downvotes to my Linux comment.
---
Really depends with the kind of management they go for, so you can't know that for sure.
---
nope :D only this 2
---
What are you talking about? I never said I don't want bugs fixed... If they're actual bugs and not just some trinket that doesn't dismounts you like it did in holy vanilla that you were probably to young to remember playing anyway. But you're apparently too invested in your 'argument' with yourself I'll do you the favor here. You're right. Blizzard fucked you over good. What you gonna do now? See how pointless this thread is? Now go back to my original post any maybe you'll understand.
---
Step 1. Be a mage
---
Step 2. Success
---
I'm not worried about trash optimization, I hardly even minmax lol, we talk about random shit in voice and yell CLEAR COMS to meme tipsout etc.
---
but if you gonna look into dps logs then excluding trash is incredibly silly and dishonest.
---
You should check Hippogriffs as well guys!
---
When a game jams loot boxes down your throat....yes it should all be free.
---
That’s been the model.
---
* free with micro transactions or
---
* premium game
---
Blizzard has figured out how to sell a premium game with micro transactions.  Guys like you fall for it as if they’re giving back to the community.
---
&gt; it's believed the classic team will work on future expansions 
---
Got a source there champ? What makes a team who got a 15 year old game running in a 2019 environment suitable for developing a brand new expansion..?
---
They didn't just say they were open to it they said it would be easy compared to classic to accomplish.  Tbc is 100% happening blizzard isn't ambitious enough for classic+ and when it comes down to it I doubt most people would truly trust them with it.
---
You've never heard of the word microtransaction have you? The company posted record profit recently
---
It’s a binary relationship, but 50/50 pertains to odds and probability. Either it’s on the hook or not, however the odds are atrociously against the likelihood it’s on the hook. Schroedinger’s Turtle, as it were.

And he's not wrong. He may be stupid, but not wrong.

You can play more mana conservative sometimes by only using rank 1 earth shock to interupt, and rank 1 frost shock to slow.
---
Autoswing away and get mana back with the 5 second rule.

I may or may not be guilty of this 🤣

But hey, i make the group, I pick the party!

---
This is a thread about bugfixes of all kinds.  I'm blocking you now goodbye.
---
&gt; Why would anyone who likes classic want TBC?
---
I like classic and I want TBC. I like arena and I like raids that aren't 2h of snooze and cya next week lads.
---
aand now the song is stuck in my head
---
I don’t work for Blizz, but was one of those “I’ll try it, but get bored before level 30.”
---
Now I’m level 45, and it’s still fun!
---
I was one of the people who was wrong.
---
“Insanely profitable”? Everyone that WOULD play tbc is already currently playing classic? It’s not as profitable as you think. Mostly because it further takes away from their retail sub count. 
---
I said in another comment, wow has stated that their sub count is not important because the cash shop in retail nets them so much more. 
---
I’m just the messenger here. Sorry if it’s not what you want to hear.
---
Remember the harpy nests that looks like a balcony, no one ever can get there without flying mounts? Surprise, you can charge there.
---
Ninjaing means breaking the agreed upon loot rules, not just "rolling need when someone could equip the boe". If you agree to give everyone equal priority on items that are freely tradeable between players, thus useful to every member of the party, following the loot rules does not make you a ninja, even if someone in the party could equip the item.
---
Is it possible with kui nameplates to show the level in the nameplate? I can't seem to find that option...
---
I'do skip TBC. Will be back for Wrath.
---
Classic and tbc are bringing in new players, you can't get microtransactions from people who won't play retail by not making the version of the game that they will play.  Sub numbers skyrocketed with classic, pull your head put of your ass.
---
id rather not get fucked over in the first place than have a "fuck this guy" list
---
PVE servers are significantly less likely to have assholes than PVP servers.  Obviously, this does not mean that you won't run into assholes on a PVE server, but you certainly will run into less. It's not stupid to believe that some servers have higher levels of toxicity than others.
---
I appreciate your beautiful and idealized vision of shaman play, but frankly it's just not represented by reality, at least in raid settings.
---
People still fallin' for it.
---
I could see that happening maybe in 5+ years when even the hardcore classic vets have lapsed their subs.
---
3/10
---
How do they know you're on the toon that fished it and you only have one cast?
---
I’m not your buddy, mate
---
Dire maul was not early. For EU players it was the exact same time
---
Like Zunkanar said, try to get around 400 healing without using straight healing greens outside of cape/wand. When you have less than 250 healing, your highest rank flashheal/heal/gheal will always be your most mana-efficient version of that spell. Renew is similar. At 250 healing, all of your ranks will have almost the exact same healing per mana. With 250 healing, spending 1000 mana on rank 3 heal vs 1000 mana on rank 4 gheal will yield about 4150 and 4140 healing respectively, almost identical.
---
Plus healing starts to shine once you push past that 250 mark. At 400 healing, in that same example, rank 3 heal will now yield 4740 while rank 4 gheal only yields 4370. At 700 healing, which is about full BiS right now, it becomes 5930 vs 4830 per 1000 mana spent.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.

its pretty simple

I say "horror" only because 70% of posts on this sub act like the world is ending or are so filled with complaints about every aspect of the game I genuinely cannot tell if the poster is a troll or just a miserable being who finds zero pleasure in anything in life.
---
I hope Zanamee finds love
---
I didn't state that I do use those rank 1's for specific occasions, but every which way I try to kill a mob, those moves cost 30-50% mana. Is that a Classic thing that apparently I am just no remembering from 2005?
---
Easy full raid heal + ability to tank 5mans build is    [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0554310050115-053201333001](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0554310050115-053201333001) 
---
This gives you everything you need from Holy except a bit of ultility (no Imp LoH/blessing), while still getting you to Blessing of Sanctuary for tanking.  BoSanc is also useful for one paladin to have in a raid for tanks.  
---
Some people prefer more or less points in Anticipation since 2 defense per skillpoint is a little high if you are only tanking level 60 mobs.  You could take the armor instead. BoKings can get dropped as well if other paladins in raid have it. 
---
I like the single point in Lasting Judgments since it lets you keep up a couple of judges on multiple targets - 20seconds from 10 is a big difference for a single point.  The imp seal of righteousness is just there for threat gen.
---
You should also be building at least 2 sets of gear - One healing, one questing/solo.  I currently have 4 (Healing, solo (pseudo-ret), trash tanking, and boss tanking). And don't forget a PVP set.
---
Thank you for your answer, it was very helpfull! Yeah I have 3x Prophecy gear (shoulders, gloves and boots), truefaith and onyxia ring, everything else is Pre-Bis. So in total I think I have around 400 healing. My playstyle is usually spamming rank 4 heal and when needed greater heal rank 3 on tanks or others if they're very low (I crit for 4k with that spell so I don't wanna overheal that). 2 weeks in a row I was top heal in our guild MC run, so I assume I'm not doing so bad, but I know I can improve.
---
&gt;Searing Blade
---
Yeah it's good with it's proc rate. But having another thing that you can hold with same dps works too. Even if it's a int staff. IMO I'd just save that sword for a twink marketplace.
---
I want TBC so bad maan, favorite exp all time
---
A casual player in vanilla would never have had the gear to experience bwl, aq40 or naxx when they released.
---
You must do the previous raids to obtain the items needed for the higher tier raids, thus the lower tier raids will always run.
---
A group of casuals, who just made lvl 60 at the release of bwl, going into bwl would be a literal suicide squad, they have a very low chance to beat razorgore and even if they manage to do that, Vael will be a hard stop.
---
I'm only here for WOTLK really
---
They definitely care about sub count but don’t report numbers publicly. If you look up their last earnings call they talk about the increase in subs due to classic. The numbers were raised up to wotlk due to marketing shee but then fell off due to changes in the world and core game mechanics. To retain/increase classic subs tbc makes the most sense following classics lifespan.  
---
Look at the changes they are making to retail. They are trying to entice classic players sure but they are also starting to recognize why they had so much fall off during cataclysm as following expansions
---
&gt;  it looks hilariously bad
---
looks like wow to me.
---
 Absolute madness paying over ten bucks a month for a game which is 15 years old. Especially since the China incident. How anyone can still support them and give them money on a monthly basis is beyond me. I guess everything is fine as long as you can drown in nostalgia, am I rite?

You start out wrong already.  Tbc was a more popular expansion than vanilla was and tons of people who's primary interest is in arena haven't touched classic.
---
I would bet literally any amount of money that we get tbc I'd take out a 2nd mortgage to make the bet.   How much do you want to lose we can get an escrow.
---
Thanks uncle
---
I think the role they had in mind was a melee Hunter spamming Wingclip rank 1 or something in that regard. Very entertaining gameplay!
---
Just because BRE is better, it doesn't mean Sulfuras is bad for warriors.
---
i did not know that, nice !
---
A lot of those whales jumped to classic because of hype. They go where the cool kids (streamers) go. Daddy’s credit card linked to their activision account does no good in classic or TBC.
---
I think i did my first MCs at around 350 as holy spec, now at around 620 as disc.
---
That makes a lot more sense. Thanks
---
Then how did battle grounds ever work?
---
My server experience is sooo much different lol. Yours feels like a super dense p server.  Nonetheless you can still summon at the BWL entrance for now. You only need 1 good option
---
i'd really like to be able to try out all the race/sex combos of my class to see all the animations without installing bannable add ons.
---
You can indeed, all our melee's get warchief's blessing each week. We have extra accounts with horde chars that have mind control cap. It's rough getting, but that 15% haste is big!
---
Stocks always drop when the earning report comes out, regardless of what it says.
---
If it's still down in a week or two, THAT will be significant.
---
&gt; It can solve pretty much any software issue
---
I can attest through a few years at a couple jobs that were made very painful because of how poorly the internal applications were written that this is not true. I know you said pretty much any, but yeah, complicated applications written poorly enough can easily get to a point where hardware doesn't help. I took that application from 40GB of RAM on one server with 4 vCPU to eight servers with 40GB RAM EACH and 4 vCPU EACH load balanced behind two F5 devices, and put the database it runs off of from a 60 spinning disk array to a 5 SSD subpool in that array and it made ZERO DIFFERENCE.
---
&gt; more RAM isn't just a random obsession, it's the correct solution in 90% of similar cases we've all solved in our life
---
Again, same point here, and this actually touches on why everyone in this subreddit is making the same suggestion. Most of the people here have built a PC at one point, or probably back in Vanilla added more RAM and found a huge performance, and they then expand that limited experience to the point they're suggesting that Blizzard just get more servers/RAM to solve the problem. That is just not going to work. I don't know the hardware they have at the moment, but I'd be willing to bet all my savings it's more than the private servers had.
---
More RAM won't fix it. More bandwidth won't fix it. The application has a bottleneck in some area when dealing with the interaction of players above a certain threshold and we don't know enough to speculate on what that bottleneck is or how to fix it. But god damn, more RAM/bandwidth are absolutely not the fix, and any senior IT consultant worth their salt you find here will tell you the same.
---
Its not silly if hes doing the work to form the party.  Easy solution, make your own group or ignore the LFM message and move on.
---
1 deathwish + stone shield potion
---
2 ???
---
3 profit
---
Good luck getting gear as a shadowpriest tho.
---
Also it’s good in 1v1 but that’s pretty useless. In group PvP they are gonna gang bang your ass and there’s nothing you can do about it. And if by any miracle you’re in combat for more than 15 seconds, that’s all your mana gone
---
Which is level 48 (wtf tho)
---
Yeah, so? All that means is to not finish you off until it expires.
---
Arugal is roughly 70-30 in favour of horde. I had a horde 60 that I stoped playing and re rolled alliance. Have a 60 rogue full pre raid bis with a couple t1 pieces. Honestly I enjoy the alliance lore, leveling zones and cities more. The only thing I like about horde are the undead and the their flight paths.
---
Thanks, I’m just under 500 with some bis left to get. I just wanted to know where I’m at :)
---
My first arena Savage Gladiator Chain dropped... I'm a shaman... My guild leader is a War.  He was running me repeatedly through BRD as a favor to me... Needless to say I passed on it for him.
---
Yep. I'd recommending setting up a macro to join and leave this channel. That way you won't get annoyed by it when you're not looking for a group.
---
No need for that. You can tank every boss without a shield if you have enough gear. If you can’t do hat don’t go fury prot imo.
---
If he’s forming the group, then he makes the rules for that group. 
---
It then falls on folks who dont care about the drop or agree to the terms to join.
---
Shadow 1v1 is insane. PvP is very rarely 1v1.  Plus it’s difficult to gear up a shadowpriest cus nobody wants them.
---
Also in no world is shadowpriest &gt; warlock . Assuming both players are not mentally disabled
---
We have a server side validation, and i don't want to explain to you how works, so go ahead, go try to upload your character with false inputs, and lets see if you can bypass the validation.
---
Imagine imagining
---
Thx.  Any constructive criticism for next one?
---
:D Here, this one. https://i.ibb.co/G0Gqf5L/Screen-Shot-2019-11-05-at-08-54-55.png
---
He popped it in a 1v2 lol, did you even watch the video?
---
pepehands
---
The little one ofc?
---
Stop presuming. If you have no source just don't try too look clever.
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying. You've described exactly how I set up group for orbs, but they just don't drop when I'm there. In my last 10 runs, 5 have probably dropped. But after like 3 runs where the group gets 1-2 orbs, even guild groups fall apart and decide to do it another time.
---
This is no longer pinned?
---
The reason WoW went south over the years isn't because the team forgot how to develop games.  It's because their design goals changed.  If they were to add onto Classic, they'd be doing so under the pretense of Classic design goals.
---
I'm not saying they'd all be hits, but the assumption that Classic+ would be a slide towards Retail is unfounded IMO.
---
Hey. I was the one that wrote it. The obfuscation is simply a small line of defence against people manipulating their own gear. We also have quite a few techniques for validating the data on the server side. There is no other way than somewhat trusting the user when making an upload based site like this :-)
---
GM, MT, ML, RL, Recruiting Officer, Gbank Officer.
---
I do it all. But god it feels like a full time job.  (1 shot onyxia weekly, and 2.5 hour MC clear 10/10)
---
Gearing up and stacking gold till phase 3 when new raids are released. P2 brings world bosses but i feel like they will be extremely contested and camped out.
---
uhhhhh i think that was about the vanilla ice cream at blizzcon not warcraft lmaoooo
---
It’s not. Everytime there’s a small skirmish near an instance for example you can feel the lag.
---
awesome, its a shame warriors don't really get any advantage from getting up there.
---
I will not play it. There is flying mounts etc.
---
I think there might be a difference in how the DPS is counted. In my last Onyxia pug a couple players linked their Details damage reports and it showed people having 400+ DPS. In my and my friend's Details only the top few had barely over 200 DPS and the rest had below that. And yes, we were checking the current segment, not overall data.
---
A hybrid has an alien parent component and a human parent component. No luck involved there
---
Everyone knows enhancement have shit mana efficiency, thats why they are not used for raids in top guilds.
---
Jesus dude
---
That's why rankers won't do city raids. They will do what's most efficient: Kill people lvl 48ish. It's quick, easy, and there's a chance it will bait lvl 60 players to come out and help them, which is a bonus. Basically means zones like Tanaris, Feralas, Un'Goro, Felwood etc will become warzones.
---
That is actually false.  
---
Maraudon and etc. released 3+ months after initial EU release.   
---
PVP was 4 months.  
---
So they have started releasing content in half the time it took before.  
---
Check the dates if you're gonna start talking shit. Ty
---
What is everyone’s thought process when healing in raid? I am finding that my longer cast spells (heal, gheal) seems to take too long and frequently tanks have been healed by the time my heal lands, leading to partial or full overheals. This pushes me to use flash heal more often to get heals in quicker, but it is significantly less mana efficient.
---
I think the issue must be how I time my heals, or being too reactionary. Thoughts?
---
ok, I listen to the conference call and I heard nothing about subs doubling so a more specific reference would be appreciated. At around 11:45 they mention that WoW *Reach* 'almost doubled sequentially' and then go on to say that Blizzard as a whole
---
Oh shit :p
---
Just made a gnome mage, do you think I will be able to level okay?
---
Cool :)
---
Why does the current content need to be completed by the majority of players before new content is released?
---
In the original EU release we got Dire Maul literally three weeks after release, where only a handful of the msot hardcore were 60. Honor system came 2 months after release. Battlegrounds 3 months after release. BWL 4 months after release and barely a month after the world first kill of Ragnaros.
---
Wind fury is useless when you have no way of reducing DPS threat. NEXT.
---
You're wrong. And you can't
---
I respec just before and just after MC. It's costly but farming as shadow is much better.
---
Shhh. He wants the classic experience.
---
I don't understand why people don't get this.
---
True
---
Good luck hahah, trying to confront any of these revisionist historians with their horseshit is impossible. I guess when it comes to logic you can't lose if you don't play the game? It isn't like Kronos isn't still out there for all the people who want the bugs and shit from pservers - yet somehow they are all here instead of there. Funny how that works
---
Lasher farming, seriously. It's probably the most effective gold farming I've ever done in vanilla and I don't understand how I was so broke when I played my priest all those years ago. It makes around 30-40 g/hour and because there's always a chance for a big drop (valuable class book or even forors dragon slaying compendium) it stays interesting enough. You also get a ton of dreamfoil (which I need for consumables) and gromsblood (which I use for flask of the titans to be forever loved by our tanks).
---
All you need is a set of gear which gives you roughly 6k mana and a mage friend to conjure you some crystal water before you go. I do my runs at around 10-12 min/run so I have to take a \~10 min break every five runs not to be locked out, but it's pretty good. Farmed around 600g over the course of a week and now I have enough to sustain me for a while.
---
Ask yourself, why are you so passionate about this discussion that you are willing to wager against your home? You’ve seemed very upset from your first comment. 
---
I think you are a bit blinded by desire for TBC.  You make it hard to have a real discussion because you are angered by the words I’m telling you regardless of if they make sense or not. 
---
That’s how it seems to me anyway.
---
True, we will look into this :)
---
As a PvP enthusiast I'd much rather have the Soulseeker staff on my mage.
---
25 magic penetration is pretty huge and underrated.
---
Gold = upgrade.
---
You dont need defense or critt/crush immunity, especially as Fury/Prot you WANT to be crit for enrage wich means more threat and dps.
---
Just get a large health pool and go ham.
---
The grass is sometimes only greener because someone has been shitting on it. Not everyone wants greener grass.
---
Do you mean the spell Crit ring with mp5?
---
There are people who will spend hundreds and thousands of dollars for random bs in retail. You dramatically underestimate/misunderstand the whales. 10 subs is worthless when one whale will spend as much as 50
---
I hope!
---
Don't diss a good disc/holy smitespec for PvP imo. Performs reasonably good healing in raids and PvP but can dish out pretty decent and consistent damage in PvP when needed.
---
Seen it
---
We don’t want you.
---
Good luck farming that Parrot in STV.
---
I kind of see your point, however, I don't think this is the default behaviour a lot of people would expect. The way I've always seen it Need 'means' you want the item because you want to use it, while Greed 'means' you want the item for it's monetary value. If you need on a BoE you don't want to use, you are making the unilateral decision to go against that. If people disagree this has the potential to create a lot of resentment in your group and might even kill it.  
---
But there is a simple way to avoid that situation. At the beginning of each dungeon, just ask: "All need on BoE's?"
---
/u/homingstar has the worst argument I've ever seen. One is BoP (Bind on pickup) and one if BoE (Bind on equip). So to break it down a little further. BoP is not tradeable between players whereas BoE is tradeable and sellable sometimes extremely valuable. To add to this even more BoP items are for the most part what every person is doing a dungeon for (besides quests) no one goes in looking for BoE's. Everyone should need unless something else is agreed upon (which is fine, I also pass things to guildies, but if I don't know you I don't owe you a damn thing) If you win the roll you can do with the item as you please including give it to the person who would use it, or if you're the person that needs the item offer to buy it at a discount.
---
Green items 10 levels below max lvl are better than some max lvl epics in classic. And if you had the best gear from vanilla it was good enought to clear early raid content in TBC. Only shit geared people replaced gear early in TBC.
---
actually it does provide threat (and that's the reason taunt is so important) just not a set amount. Taunt gives you enough threat to put you on top of the threat table, so even if the boss reset your threat with one of its abilities you can get all of it back with taunt
---
Can I have the name of the guild that’s carrying your ass? Just wanna know so I can reroll Ret and get a free ride. Love playing meme specs.
---
More specifically; mages could literally solo *anything* sheepable otherwise by just sheep&gt;frostbolt&gt;sheep&gt;frostbolt on repeat for however long it takes to kill the mob.
---
&gt; A lot of those whales jumped to classic because of hype 
---
And now that the hype's gone? What d'you think the sort of morons that buy mounts are going to do as soon as Blizzard releases a new one? Log into retail and buy it. Classic as a game is not remotely enough to keep people that stupid engaged on its own, they need to have the latest shiny thing, and in Classic that doesn't exist. Classic is not for them, it's for the people who realised many years ago that retail is beyond the point of repair.
---
what did i do?
---
Cool, but that was a genuine question about how the game maths work.
---
Do you think people in vanilla didn't avoid inviting other warriors who would compete with their loot?
---
Oh, If you wanna beat mages (there are a lot of them), pick warlock.
---
I have participate in a lot of 20v20 without any issue but yeah 100% of 10v10 are laggy as hell.
---
There’s no force on earth that could make me resub to retail. If I get bored of classic, so be it but it will mean I move on and not to retail.
---
Will be way faster: in roughly 12-18 months, Shadowlands will be released and Vanilla will be close to the final phase.  At this point Blizzard will scrutinise the numbers hard: how many people still play Classic, how many are playing Shadowlands and if the numbers are not that good, then you can bet they will announce  Burning Crusade.
---
I mean it's perfect for them: one year you make an expansion, one year you re-release a vintage edition and all of that, while not making great sense, will keep the subscription numbers high and please share-holders
---
Grinding 100g is much faster than obtaining R3.
---
Raid healing has been.... underwhelming. I cant really reaction heal. I spam rank 1 chain heal and maybe cancel if everyone is full HP. Rinse, repeat. In crazy damage fights I can use lesser healing wave to get out a few life saving heals.
---
Nothing lol that just seems like a lot to me.
---
But you don't *need* those other classes to run the dungeon.
---
You see the difference?
---
the lazy man's odds
---
I farmed elemental fire like 4 times this week, literally 3 hunters running around with names like "Hdkeowidk", "Shoekwldkslaoi", "Dackdopqoeicksl", everytime I went there.  Also, the same Chinese farmers there everytime as well...they always say "4 elemental fire to me I leave"
---
sure, but if you dont want to depend on other people, there is a way to do it yourself :)
---
and it took me 25-30 runs to actually get the pants
---
I even died to that as a Mage yesterday as I tried to pop my Gnomish Cloaking Device. Was just trying to reset the mobs so I could (potentially) resurrect the healer with my Jumper Cables.
---
Lol, “handy”
---
I have chafed a boss and ended up off a cliff.
---
Anyone that doesnt agree with this, thats your opinion.  If you are upset at someone actively forming a group and being upfront about what they are after... well dont join. 
---
Some folks want to min/max, thats how they play. Im for letting them do them and me do me. 
---
Good for that dude being upfront about the rules AND looking for folks that agree. 
---
You dont like the loot rules, dont join and move on.  
---
As someone who lost the 3rd gem for UBRS 9 times before finally winning the role, i can understand the desire to reserve stuff. But most folks will not join as they may be in the same situation.
---
Yeah man. It won’t be as easy as phase 1 but doable. I’m leveling my hunter alt now as well with my warrior alt. Hunter is 16 and warrior is 8. Don’t listen to youtubers. BRM has been a shit fest since a long time and will continue to be a shit fest in phase two. 
---
Also, 70/30 looks bad on paper. But I’ve managed to 2v6 horde with another warrior when we got ganked while doing an escort in arathi. We then camped those 6 people until a couple level 60s showed up to help. There have been multiple instances where I have won fights while the odds were against me. I think horde has a lot of new players that haven’t gotten a good grasp of game mechanics yet. Yes there are some good people on horde side, but it’s been fine now.
---
Hmu in game, I’ll get you some bags and pots to start with :). Pm me your bnet tag
---
\^true. CBA about the karma though. Just want a working battle chicken for the 5% haste buff when smacking bosses. Need that rogue utility in raids.
---
It’s a fifty fifty chance.
---
dude you are getting memed on, "the 50/50 either you get it or you don't" is an osrs meme
---
Greater heal tanks and at halfway through the bar you either let it land or cancel it at full. Flash heal dps and renew on melee/tanks is what I do.
---
Check the pitfalls section here, it covers heal sniping. If you feel forced to flash heal, either you or someone else is doing it wrong (or you have too many paladins):  
---
https://brainingguild.wordpress.com/2018/01/29/vanilla-wow-priest-healing-guide/
---
Make sure your incoming heals are working - most raid frame addons should have it out of the box as long as they're updated, but it also requires all other healers in your raid to use them, if they don't you should ask them to. That way you will see when a target is already receiving heals and can prioritize others instead.
---
Although for MC you can flash heal on trash or shorter fights because mana isn't an issue, and keeping people alive vs back to back fireballs is more important.
---
\&gt;&lt;
---
Wts Legolas name in stalagg eu 10bucks pls dm me
---
Well it means that no expansion launch has been more popular than classic wows launch
---
I hope so. It's the main reason I'm playing classic. I just want the arena. I was glad s1 into wrath. This is when arena was fun before blizzard catered to all the cry babies about pve being viable.
---
Oh you mean the game supported for 3 (and who knows how many when ow2 will come out) with free updates like heroes, events, maps and more? Yeah man I cant believe how evil blizz is /s
---
because dropping 200g on something that could drop is dumb, if it was a crafted item that is different but this is a completely random drop i could go LBRS tonight and get it drop while helping out a guild member rather than drop 200g on the AH to someone that probably got the item by enforcing the All Need rule
---
What are some of the buffs/heals that you can't cast onto other players while they're NOT in your party?
---
From what I can see, I can't cast power word shield on any other players except my party members.
---
Dog you need to work on your reading comprehension. 
---
Also, aren’t we all discussing things? I thought that’s how reddit works?
---
LOL I did this but was leveling with 3 friends and would advertise as looking for ranged dps. we were grinding for XP and so me and the tank could both get it. Barb can last you a long time.
---
Obviously i cant see the server code to fight against your point, but only way i can imagine it is possible to fight against manipulation is comparing multiple imports of same character (which i dont think you do as it would create issue of not being able to update your armory)
---
Good luck, I did not mean to be cunt or something, but when i see someone claiming "Encryption" when it has nothing to do with true encryption I got tilted.

I disagree, quoting "Art. 4 GDPR Definitions":  
---
‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, **an online identifier** or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;  
---
(emphasis mine.)  
---
So the character name alone makes it my personal data.
---
Not even, if as a consequence of Classic, retail becomes more like Classic or Vanilla? 
---
It seems that this is already in the works.
---
T1 is better due to 1% spell hit which is a more popular stat whereas T2 loses some value to mp5.
---
Also many guilds have already started split Onyxia runs with 15-20 members so T2 is easy to come by anyways. For T1 you need to get lucky with Garr.
---
While retail may end up making more money overall due to the cash shop, classic has zero impact on those people.
---
Gottem
---
&gt; Please stop saying that a private server latency experience is equivalent to a distributed network hosting more than 100 times the playerbase.
---
It's not a "distributed network", the servers are completely independent of eachother. That's why you pick a server... Your character isn't on all of them at once...
---
If it's not a good weapon nobody gets mad. That's the situation here.
---
Go for it dude. See how far that gets you in life.
---
I hear ya loud and clear. My intention is never to ninja, or roll need first and tell the group thats how it goes, it has to be a mutual decision. I would be lying if I said I wouldn't turn into a salt mine myself if it was a BoE upgrade for me and I lost out to all need. I would rather lose to all need, than to a ninja though, it's the lesser of the two evils I guess.
---
Ahh that old rascal !
---
You haven’t participated in any 20v20.
---
Im not dissing it. A warrior/Priest combo is a beast. Often the BG side with most healers wins. Heals are strong in pvp :D
---
this is the point i am trying to make saying you run all need rule to prevent ninjas is stupid as you are punishing people that have no intention of being a ninja just in case someone is
---
I'm not sure that is totally true. I understand what you mean but you cannot treat the 10000th in a nutshell, you have to calculate it as the odds of 9999 already not getting it.
---
So your first cast is like .01, 10000th cast is something like 1- .99 x 10000
---
I know the math isn't exactly right, it's 5am cut me some slack.
---
I dont think so either.
---
Im assuming that the dutch word is very similar to the german one but is usually used in a different context. Thats why im curious.
---
I looked it up with google translate and the dutch translation is "Schurk"
---
I don't think that you're wrong per se, but this is the same company that told us many times over that "there is no demand for it" about classic. And yet, here we are. Now I don't expect that we will get BC or Wrath, but it would be very foolish for Blizzard to miss out on this especially because the thing that "no one wanted" turned out to be something highly desired. Retail is a cash-cow without a doubt, but most of the people who play classic religiously do not want Retail and would rather just stop playing rather than being forced into retail. Blizzard will need to contend with that loss of subscription which, even if it isnt going to bankrupt them, will negatively impact profit and stock value. They may want to push people back into retail, but this is a community that will not go quietly and that is something they will consider.
---
Similar to the OP i received the crimson whelpling on my very first kill. gz on the emerald whelpling i was not as lucky (killed around 400 and never went back)
---
Just did a run this morning and both dropped on the same run. Needless to say the mage was thrilled.
---
Was he trying to say neutral?
---
Never happening.
---
Omg one can dream 😍
---
If warrior has a good weapon, it's easily doable.
---
Yes, done plenty of runs on my pala / priest so far, but we didnt get any chests yet. Hunters can even solo the arena and farm the chest on their own.
---
Everyone duo farms arena as warrior/healer its easy
---
isn’t dungeon finder WotLK? agree with all your other points though, especially no flying
---
The thing is i want to keep the blizzard UI, which addon remove. Thus, I want the hp script only, bit cant find it :(
---
Ok grandpa
---
ok, I listen to the conference call and I heard nothing about subs doubling so a more specific reference would be appreciated. At around 11:45 they mention that WoW *Reach* 'almost doubled sequentially' which I take to mean 'the number of people exposed to WoW marketing materials almost doubled over last quarter' and then go on to say that Blizzard added more monthly and longer term subscription plans than in any prior quarter, but without specific numbers there's no way to say that subs doubled.
---
From what I can tell MAUs increased around 2mil over last quarter so at most there could've been 2 million new subscribers. If every one of the MAUs bought a WoW subscription, it's not surprising this is their best quarter ever, but to say WoW subs doubled would mean only 1 mil people were playing wow pre-classic which seems unlikely.
---
Later, in the Q&amp;A portion of the call, around 43:30 a guy asks about retention trends for Classic subs and the response is that "we've seen player engagement into Q4 with subscriptions in some regions continuing to grow" but there's still no solid metrics to say 'subscriptions doubled'
---
Normally you offer the healer to get all blues for vendor
---
Not everyone, just the fucking morons who come up with bad ideas and then curl into a ball when they get called out on them.
---
Good mages beat hunters. They can stay in the deadzone long enough. Mages always lose to Felhunter. Vs Rouge I guess WL also does better than hunters. Not sure about that one though.
---
You don't understand how many people would be playing classic uf only there was new content
---
I mean, people aren't aware of an old ass meme from a different game and that's entertainment? Man you must have an exciting life lol
---
This is specifically why you don’t go enhancement shaman. Ele/resto or resto spec. You’re part of the reason why horde will suck. Shamans are integral to the strength of the horde through their support abilities and insane burst from range. Not slot machine style melee burst.
---
(you are the only one who thinks you're on trial here)
---
and yet it will drop at some point, i will always run dungeons to help people. on retail which still has the same drop chance i have seen it drop 3 times, always lost the roll though.
---
&gt;I don't have the resources to commit
---
That just sounds like an excuse, too.
---
The rank 14 grind is literally all time, 0 skill. Especially when you have win-trading groups these days via discord.
---
I would say yes just for the fact that nearly every raid group (even the fastest ones) are bringing 8-10 healers which is probably overkill and leads to some huge disparity in healing done. Also casters will become your friend for PI, and it's probably a better pve farm spec. Oh yeah and if you move like 6 points around you can drop imp renew/inspiration/2 point of holy spec to be in your pvp spec. You just won't be the one applying renews on tank or giving him the armor buff but it's pretty w.e
---
Any spells that you can only cast on party members will say that you can only cast them on party members.
---
This is change I could stand behind.
---
He was responding the context that IF blizzard reworked their entire server infrastructure. things could be better. That simply aint happening. Akin to a frog having wings so its ass doesn;t bump on the ground when it lands after jumping.
---
&gt; Remember the version we have of Classic is the last patch before Dark Portal / Pre TBC patch. Everything is nerfed the reason people quit naxx at the end is because TBC was just 2-3months away.
---
That's not accurate. Things are "nerfed" because of fixed talents, fixed itemization and the 16-slot debuff (which came in vanilla anyways). Bosses, with some small exceptions, have the same HP/damage values they had when they were released. 
---
More people will get in because the overall level is much higher. Definitely more people are raiding MC nowadays than did back then and it's just 2 months after release.
---
So glad I struck a nerve with you about the projected business model of a gaming company. How fragile can you possibly be?
---
I will try that. /ty
---
I just started reporting the character that sent the invite. I figure if enough people report them a mod has to take a look.
---
I was agreeing, people are like its the end of doing anything in the game world. Try leveling with the masses on STV like it was on week 2, people are having easy leveling now and are crying. This sub is 100% crying, no discussions or theorycraft, awful forum it became.
---
/ty
---
Sounds good ya prick.
---
TBC is trash and the beginning of the end.
---
I played with Gold Iron Rods for a while lol, buy ingot for like 20 silver, sell the rod for 3 gold. And people kept buying it for days XD.
---
RemindMe! 15 months
---
It might be a huge change for you, but you could also try switching to either TUKUI (I use this), or ELVUI which isn’t so minimal 
---
For an example song - there was one PVP are used to use this one song from MSI for his PVP videos. 
---
I’m not an MSI fan but it worked out pretty well
---
What about vanish is broken? I remember it was "broken" up until cataclysm or so in that it was super unreliable in pvp.
---
Report and move on. Whining on Reddit won’t get them banned any faster, reporting them will.
---
its a vanity item
---
It's gotten me a lot of success actually. Go get what you want, not worry about other people's lives around you.
---
There is a way in interface option
---
right click channel -&gt; settings -&gt; other -&gt; unclick ''Channel'' guess that would prob to the job
---
But nostalrius wasn t laging ?
---
i hope not. i want the timeline to be different. i think new raids and story arcs would bring blizz more money (if they were good).
---
the problem is you shouldn't assume everyone is a ninja, in reality very few players are that petty to steal an item when it could mean they are black listed on the server, more so no than in vanilla as servers have discords and subs set up where someone ninja looting will be spread around faster than they can hearthstone out with their ill gotten gains
---
Hell yeah!
---
Candy Crush is also much more approachable to a very casual base. Many people don't have the time to play any of the blizzard games (except maybe hearthstone), but candy crush is much easier to learn, play, drop, pick up again and continue. The people that don't have the time also have the money.
---
You must be the biggest loser in the world.
---
Activision merge wasn't a thing until the end of TBC. No changes.
---
There’s an addon called leatrix plus that blocks that crap I think
---
Fifteen years ago you didn’t know if you were lagging or if the server was.
---
I know that dwarf priests have a fear ward spell. Does other races have specific spells too?
---
At least wash your anus bro.
---
I’m level 40, and I would say that by level 27 you have already learned most of your spells.  Berserker stance does not have that many action specific spells (whirlwind, intercept, and berserker rage.).
---
I suggest you stick with it, because you have already done most of the work. Questing really helped me learn this method and improve my APM. 
---
My rotation changed at 36 (when I learned whirlwind and sweeping strikes) but in a good way. 
---
For example, I charge, pull 2 mobs together, build enough rage to use sweeping strikes (blood rage if necessary), switch to berserker stance,  use berserker rage to build rage for whirlwind, and then I use slam. 
---
You will kill 2 mobs in the time it takes to kill 1 with this method. 
---
With dungeons, it’s basically the same, but you switch to defensive stance after using whirlwind, equip a sword and shield, use demo shout, and tab sunder. I use sword and shield as 1 and 2 on my defensive specific action bar so I can equip these items quickly.
---
My last tip is that weapon equipping and stance changing use a different GCD than your other spells. Meaning, you can switch to berserker stance and use berserker rage really fast (without having to wait a second between each spell).  I set my 2 handed weapon to “R” in defensive stance, so that way I can equip it after a pull is done, switch to battle stance, and charge the next mob with “R” to keep the flow going.
---
Thanks and I hope this helps!
---
i usually: do the arena, then go up and through the arena upstairs, left accross the bridge through the domicile out onto the lesge where you could drop down onto incendius. one of the other doors from that ledge is the vault. the last one goes through the golems down to incendius.
---
Interested to know how you came up with that conclusion
---
No nerves struck, I'm just calling you out on your BS. You had a bad idea and people told you how bad it was so you got upset. It's ok, champ.
---
Why?
---
What server do you play on?
---
My rogues name is Stabbydoo
---
Okay so what should I be sttacking stat wise for my spriest and can you go into detail about the rotation I should be using? I know I'm only casting 3.spells most of the time but should I be down ranking? Shadow damage vs spirit?
---
Its heavily used in the runescape community
---
10 gold 3 usd is really expensive dude. Current market dropped down to 10g, 1.1 usd after DM farms.
---
This, its been like 2 months and I don't think I've seen many bug fixes. W+strafe animation is still a bit bugged, and it was known since early beta.
---
I’m only doing the equivalent to the Invincible gag. Putting out some obvious but juicy bait, then sticking to my guns. I’m at worst a Trade Troll, a whole level above a Barrens Troll.
---
&gt; Its exponential, which is one of the worse cases - O( n2 )
---
O(n^2) is quadratic, not exponential.
---
enough of these posts already, please. there’s a plethora of subs you can browse if you want to look at cats/dogs. classicwow doesn’t need to be one of them.
---
I'm on the Classic hype train for sure. But just to bring everyone back down to reality, I know more people that have moved on to Retail after coming back for Classic than I do people who have stayed playing Classic like me. Driving subscription numbers does not imply they're ONLY playing Classic. It means the resubscribed to the WoW service in general.
---
So you don’t have a real answer then :)
---
I literally said "I don't get it", you idiot.
---
&gt; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier
---
Gonna say that if you name your character after your own name, you threw GDPR straight out the window.
---
No one can identify you based on your username or your gear. So no, it is not part of GDPR, cause if it was armory would just not exist, or you would not be able search after users on reddit for example.
---
You cant just quote the first article you find when googling GDPR and use it as your argument unless you understand what it writes. Thats the problem with GDPR, most people have no idea what it means, so as soon as they feel like it they will just scream GDPR, even though they have no idea what it actually is.
---
Maybe the reservement is for someone else in the party? L O L
---
Why dont you play retail? The endgame is more polished and the endgame is pretty much the whole game?
---
Dont you have other hobbies like sports or socializing?
---
So why do ya'll think this will kiill world pvp?  It didn't back in vanilla where it was likely even worse.   I remember Any raid on a major city ended up being a slide show but was still fun as fuck.  Don't you think you guys might be over reacting a bit?
---
Wyvern centipede, on cinemas!
---
I’m currently at + 421 healing with 52 mana per 5 while casting. But that’s full prebis and bis items. I’d say a decent range to start Mc is around +250-300 healing
---
Why do I feel like I see this same image at least 3 times a day...
---

Has Blizzard really given you the feeling that they are in control and thinking long term nowadays? It's the company that 'invented' MOBA and released HOTS 5 years after League of Legends, made a new version of Team Fortress 2  in 2016 when kids were getting crazy about battle royal, thought it was a good idea to announce Diablo on mobile in front of a BLizzcon audience and refused to see the potential of classic for years and released it with 3 PvP servers. Their only real success in the last 10 years was Hearthstone and the rest is just cashing on the immense popularity of their brand.
---
In my opinion, they are now realising that there's still an audience for MMO and if people left it was partially because their game weren't that good. If they are really thinking long term, then they will continue with expansion - BC - expansion - WOTLK and then announce a Warcraft 2.0
---
Nother question, you get force of will for the standard PVEish PI spec right?Also by PvP spec you mean trade those 6 points for imp inner fire and blessed recovery right? or maybe mana burn.
---
No, attacking someone while taming is perfectly acceptable because you are a member of the opposing faction.
---
Attacking someones rare mob while its being tamed if youre on the same faction however may even be griefing under the tos :P
---
For PVE, shadow damage &gt; everything else. With pots/runes you shouldn't be having mana issues in the current tier, so don't downrank.

---
People are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling
---
I healed in vanilla and really loved priest healing in BGs but im thinking of just going pure Shadow this time around.   Whats a good level to swap over from a healing build to dumping in shadow?
---
I love this
---
my point with BoP/BoE is at the end of the day all you are saying is "its gold" if its for gold it is for GREED it is in the essence of the word, if you use that gold for an upgrade is beside the point at that exact moment it is for GREED, if the item is an upgrade you are going to use then it is an item you NEED as you NEED to use it not sell it for gold, i can't believe that people are that petty and narrow minded that they feel people aren't allowed to need things
---
Would like to vote but would not like to log in.
---
I think rather than 'deserves' it should go to the person who actually thinks they will finish it.
---
We gave it to our class leader who was always available for every raid
---
I agree bro, 99% of player's won't ninja and personally the only time I have come across it in classic was a new priest needing a +frostdmg cloak, once it was explained to them it has zero benefit to their build they handed it over to the mage and said sorrry.
---
Unfortunately greed gets the better of some when a 300g item hits the roll. I ain't ever gonna hit need without consulting the party like I said, but community has decided this is the best way to combat ninjas and I can't really offer a better solution myself other than a good public shaming so here we are.
---
Yes Trolls get a curse that reduces healing and Forsaken get a curse that....I dont remember.
---
Yeah man! I think you can get thrash blade earlier than level 48, but it’s recommended to be around 46-48 to do a full run. There are good leather shoulders and boots that drop as well. If your close to level 58 or so, might just decide it’s better to start farming dal rends in ubrs. Not the end of the world if you decide you don’t want to get thrash blade.
---
I'm not your friend, sport.
---
It's possible.  I haven't played classic.  How would alliance get wcb then?  That kind of sucks.
---
The fog that exists because of hardware limitations actually benefit the immersion of the game
---
Side note. Why is cassandras grace even BiS? You can argue that healing power is the singular most important stat a healer can have, but even then a random lvl 54 green hat of healing is better. 9 spirit is fuck all, and 7 stamina is useless.
---
If you value those stats higher than +12-15 healing, which a green BoE nets you compared to Cassandras, then the caster hat from Strat should be even better, as it sacrifices 14 healing for 8 int. I wouldnt even buy that garbage for 10g, why is it so expensive?
---
All of a sudden om quite happy with reaching Rank 11. I thought it something of an embarrasment at the time but this shines light on just how brutal the decay really is at those higher levels. And since i was raiding at the time i probobly never got into those top 2-3 brackets.
---
&gt; if you do want to be so "fair" about it, you can still trade it if you win it. Set up a /roll in your group. Where if everyone greeds then it gets TRULY ninjad, you're all fucked.
---
but there is a system in place so you don't need to do this, the way you are talking is the reason that retail has that stupid system in place where drops in raids are completely random and sometimes will go to waste as people can't be trusted to play fair
---
Do not use special characters or even accented letters. It is what the locals call, "hot garbage."
---
They do it every game I thot
---
Sorry bout that didn't mean to say you were dissing it, it was meant as slang for: "this shit's tite".

See his username.

As a mage my life is easy. Any armor that is red: Greed

"They same sub pays for both games" not 100% true, you could play up until Legion with only a sub. Have to shell out a lot for the latest exp...
---
yes the alchemy vendor in IF sells it
---
Hey, so, LPT, if you're gonna argue against someone, discrediting them with "I don't know what Blog post you read" is basically tantamount to name calling.
---
So don't do that.
---
Second, this is one tiny layer of security. Never mind the mentioned authentication servers. Never mind the infrastructure necessary to mitigate DDoS. Never mind the infrastructure necessary to mitigate multiple other attacks.
---
I dropped into transport layer security because you hadn't mentioned even one God damn ounce of any actual knowledge. You dropped into "shut up, my dad words at Nintendo".
---
So I felt it necessary to bring up even the *tiniest* of technical applications to actually, ya know, *fucking say anything at all*.
---
Does transport security really fuck with latency? Under enough scale, yes.
---
Does it affect game play? Probably not.
---
If you plan to raid enhance do it right.  We have 1 in our guild and hes great for the following reasons
---
Full time twisting - your mana is for keeping buffed GoA and WF on the tank group not dumping into dps
---
Tremor timing - when a fear Is incoming you need to time tremor to be a janky fear ward. Ours on ony keeps the tanks defeared almost entirely 
---
Interrupts - rank 1 e shock to help interrupt duty
---
Annihilater (sp) - keep that armor debuff up and later weave with nightfall
---
We arent bringing you for dps. Its because we like you and you're willing to go full time support
---
They would be assaulted with questions at BlizzCons
---
The chances of getting it on your first cast are exactly the same as getting it on your last cast.
---
That's some nice pussy!
---
Friendly reminder not to listen to people who tell you that BiS is unimportant.
---
You legally can't lie on these investor calls. They have no reason to lie. And there are external auditors and an internal board audit committee to verify all their claims.
---
Exactly this. Baffles me how people cannot even grasp this simple concept of private servers that has been the case since the dawn of the first one.
---
This boys, this.
---
Yes. Each race has two. E.g. Undead have a powerful but expensive DoT called Devouring Plague.
---
Thank you for taking the time to listen to the conference call and break it down for us!
---
it's also a 4 day cooldown, not 3.
---
When you put the *actual* numbers in, it's a lot less attractive. 4 gold a day?  I dropped that profession like a brick once I had truefaith.
---
Do you not know that this is a business. Businesses are about money, read profit and revenue. Sub numbers mean nothing if subs cost $1.00. 
---
Use your head before tossing insults
---
I tank dungeons really well. Most people say they prefer me to a Warrior. Just because your endgame is raiding doesn't mean that it's mine.
---
As a Warrior I appreciate you putting it in terms I can follow
---
Human: desperate prayer (instant self heal on 10 minute cd) and feedback (3 minute cd that makes spells cast on you burn attackers mana)
---
Dwarf: desperate prayer (same) and fear ward
---
Night elf: elune's grace (5 min cd that gives 10% dodge and ranged dmg reduction) and starshards (6 second channel that deals ok damage)
---
Undead: devouring plague (high damage dot that heals you, 3 min cd) and touch of weakness (self buff that reduces enemy damage when they hit you)
---
Troll: hex of weakness (20% healing reduction debuff on target) and shadowguard (buff that deals shadow damage to attackers, triggers blackout).
---
The only thing I heard about doubling in the call was at 11:48
---
&gt; WoW *Reach* almost doubled sequentially in Q3 as both existing and prior players embraced the arrival of WoW Classic
---
Someone else could speak more to this since I'm not an expert, but as I understand it, Reach would be 'people exposed to marketing material', so with all the twitch streams and general hype surrounding the classic launch, that is not surprising at all.
---
The slide states that 
---
&gt;WoW Classic drove the biggest quarterly increase to subscription plans in franchise history, in both the West and East
---
but, again, no concrete numbers on how many subs
---
Can this same addons be used to camp prince for tidal charm ?
---
That's just part of the whole nochanges thing. WoW has been dying for 15 years now.
---
Oops. Classic is free to play, you only have to pay the sub. *shrug*
---
i can say that i am pretty lucky then to be on a server where i have not once had a party insist all need/greed on something that was an upgrade, i agree on things like the 16 slot bags where pretty much everyone needs it either for them self or for their bank.
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/priest-healer-pve-guide

A little down the page lists the priest racials

That made me laugh, thank you good sir.
---
I'm 36 runs in to strat live on my warlock and wou and up getting archivists cape of shadow wrath first :/ lost roll on the star 5 times.
---
5 man healing it all falls on you. There is a huge difference between ele resto and a heavier resto build. You can probably force the ele build but you will wipe way more often because you won't be able to keep up heals.

Good to see that other opions on the topic are not allowed and the majority of people "can't need" cause you think so and that there is no "other way".
---
And pls dont explain your point even further cause im disagree. I have understand your argument and have another opion on whats right and wrong in this situation.
---
Fuck these thread and people that not let me have my way. This mentality is truly awfull
---
The point is that it isn't possible in classic, which is why they don't value the success of classic as much as retail. They want you to use the more profitable mousetrap.
---
Do you know how businesses operate?
---
It drives player retention which is related
---
That’s not how odds work lol
---
You could do 1 billion runs and never see it drop. You don’t have any better chance to have it drop, your odds just go up.
---
I often 2 man arena and 3 man anger runs. Friends always get me in there to heal by letting me have all the blue drops they don't want. I think it's a good deal. I've vendor at least 10 axes from anger and if I recall correctly, it vendors for ~6-7g.
---
Also you completely missed the point of the post, discussing specs people have been having fun with, not bashing other people's.
---
Ah don't quit!
---
I am level 38 and plan to hit 40 this weekend.  I am reading about the horrors of Phase 2 but I don't want to quit!
---
You're not supposed to get it. It kind of sucks. But horde doesn't get paladin buffs, which also kind of sucks.
---
You’re asking why are you struggling. The answer is you are doing it wrong. Go watch an elemental shaman pvp video and you tell me what looks more reliable. Go chain heal and stop trying to be a DPS. If it wasn’t for wind fury totem you would never be taken for groups as enhancement. You have a shit mana pool for a class that needs mana to do anything. And don’t roll on dps class gear bc ur worthless as the game progresses.
---
Keep in mind how a large company works, and how that company viewed Classic at the outset. Literally everything points to a general view of "There is enough interest in Classic to warrant trying it, and we will see how it goes."
---
Money doesnt move fast in a big company like this, and money is needed to tackle big problems. I'd assume that someone heading the Classic project wants as much or more than any of us for this to be successful, popular and more than anything profitable. After a quarterly report like the one we saw, they'll be able to request more resources to pull in a larger support and technical staff.
---
All in all, expect changes! But dont expect them NOW NOW NOW. We are making our desires known by playing the game, reporting bugs and keeping streamers/journalists talking about how the game is good.
---
Valid points actually
---
You are correct. And that is why I expect TBC. Now, I like TBC, I will play a re-release, but I 100% agree that a classic+ would be a better long term solution.
---
In before the stream of boo hoo BC has flying mounts gets too big.  
---
I think Blizzard has a rough timeline of releasing BC and Wrath over the next few years.  At the same time I think they will keep a finger on the pulse of Classic to see how interest carries through.  If there is enough sustained long term interest in Classic, I think they start releasing Classic+ content in the form of mini expansions that you buy, on par with a large DLC.  
---
I don’t think there is a road between Classic and Classic+ that doesn’t involve Blizzard being able to monetize new content.  I would rather pay $10-$20+ for new content that I can probably get hundreds of hours of content from than start the inevitable slide into cosmetic micro transactions.
---
If you want to do something whilst it current; you put in the effort to do that thing before its too late, and its no longer current.
---
So "casuals" either lvl more/faster or theyre out of luck.
---
Its not rocket science.
---
Yeah, and burst healing to get 5SR regen is a great dungeon strategy; I just don't think it translates well to raid healing. Fights are too bursty, short, or easy in MC to even consider anything else.
---
And past P2, when we get the harder BWL fights, priests will quickly get the 3 piece T2 combo for a whopping 30% mana regen while casting plus MP5 making 5SR regen pretty redundant with the insane passive priest regen.
---
Do I seem upset? Yeah I think it’s the reading comprehension again.
---
That BoE can be traded between any player in the world, and I could potentially trade for the BoE I need. It's not just gold, It's hours upon hours of farming. Unless you are a guildie I'm not just gonna let you have an item worth 500gold and I'll more then likely never see you or speak to you again, you're crazy. I deserve a chance at that just as much as you do. You go ahead and keep rolling greed on them though because I'll straight up say roll need, and then roll need.  Just don't complain about a "ninja" because you made mistake of clicking the wrong button.
---
batched mob auto attacks break it. not much they can do really.
---
Versus a prot warrior...yeah (not really a feral druid).
---
Ret Pali definitely.
---
If you're on kromkrush, hit me up, I'm always down to heal arena/ anger runs.
---
Day 34. My raidleader still hasnt flgured im 30/0/21
---
He is either correct or he isn't, so there is a 50% chance he is right.
---
How soon is it *theoretically* possible to reach rank 14?
---
&gt; Sure, some people will hold strong. But most will cave.
---
There isn't a chance that I will go back to retail, and there are a LOT of that same mentality playing Classic now. It is Classic or nothing. 
---
Personally, I wouldn't even bother with TBC, it doesn't matter to me at all. I disliked the Outlands, I disliked all my gear being made worthless, I disliked the dispersing of the top end population out of Azeroth, and I disliked flying. The only thing I want out of TBC is better class/spec balance, and I'd rather deal with the vanilla specs than have TBC. So I don't much care if they do TBC or not. But there isn't a chance I will be back in retail. I lost interest in Cata, attempted two or three times to re-sub and get re-interested over the years and always met with the same boredom and disinterest. There is no going back. (And I am not the type of personality that buys the random shit from the shop, I just play my sub, so the extra baubles mean nothing to me.)
---
can you use the item now or in the future and are not going to sell it for gold or trade it for something else? no then it is for greed that you want it it is as simple as that its the way the loot system has always been and due to people acting like you are say blizz slowly changed it to the point it is now a useless system in retail where you cant pass loot or master loot items to build a team you get what you are given and if it is a higher item level, even if not an upgrade you can't even trade it to people.
---
Really hope Blizzard learns from Classic and apply some changes to Retail.
---
Actually, I think the new leveling system in Shadowlands is something in that direction.
---
That's cute you need an ability to reduce threat, we just use our brains.
---
But paladins are rare, and ret even rarer. Chances are they didnt have any ret paladins in the guild.
---
Looking forward to making people cry!
---
My only worry is that all the farm spots I use for mats will be unplayable lol.
---
Oh yeah, pressing 2 buttons, or 1 if you have macro at 10 sec interval. True art my man.
---
There are going to be battlegroups in classic, doubt queues will be that bad and there will still be BGs rolling during dead hours
---
*Laughs in raid geared orc warlock*.
---
And just like retail, there will be bumps with each "patch" or "phase" that comes along as well.
---
np, I was just leveling skinning anyway XD
---
It's the pool by the fishing trainer in Org.
---
Rather worry about trash kill speed which is 80% of the dungeon than how to kill lucifron 0.2see faster
---
Wiping then downing on first try? hmmmmm sounds like it wasn't a first try but more of a bad group. Haven't needed a paladin yet to down ony.
---
Incendious
---
This topic gets posted multiple times per day. Please scroll through some things next time.
---
As far as the actual post, can you just play the game as it is without needing to be so impatient for whatever is next? There is a ton of classic left to come out, and it's going to be a while. 
---
And obviously, if there's still hype about classic+ in 18 months or so, Blizzard likes your money so they will definitely make it.
---
Ah ok.  Kromcrush here.
---
I'm always looking for buddies to group up with.
---
It's worth it just for Mind Control.
---
He said on the 7.3.5 client
---
\#OneChange
---
i'm excited for the level squish and "make every level count" when shadowlands hits. i'll be curious to see how the roll out the next expansion.
---
No, I'm saying they get you in with classic and find a way to get you interested in retail because that's where the money is. They are a business. They want money.
---
Stop putting words in my mouth and creating these strawman arguments. You have no idea what I'm saying and you have no interest in understanding the other perspective being smelling your own farts so stop being so pretentious. I prefer classic and want classic to succeed. I am purely making the point from a business perspective
---
If they go the tbc route wow is dead forever.
---
Would like to know as well. Apparently, we can solo Princess in Maraudon but I'm not sure that's effective since most BiS gear doesn't drop there.
---
Threat meters are pretty inaccurate unfortunately.
---
I’ve never played retail. At least not since WotLK. I just desire to be nearer to there when phase 2 happens so I can get in on some world PvP action better, and have a less tough time with people ganking me. It’s already pretty crowded in high level areas.
---
No one cares about world firsts in classic.  Naxx will be cleared on the first day.  Speed runs are the only thing that matters.
---
"War never changes" was in the original Fallout.

---
I’m not your mate, cunt
---
What's the point of the Karazhan port though.
---
Will say your lucky, I make 3 laps for about 6 nodes. Its wierd because I never see anyone yet there is hardly ever any. Have handy notes with them all marked too.
---
Only 6? :D
---
I can see how the shit goes to hell then. E.g. too many melees and few ranged. Phase 1 gets over quick so tanks has less time getting threat, then all the phase 2 threat is divided over too few ranged dps that they have to gain more treath than the tanks for phase 3 to start.

Am hunter, equip-able = mine

"Buy on rumor, sell on fact."
---
The stock price already had built in the expected boom in demand for Classic subscriptions.
---
Two things happen after announcements:
---
- proft taking by managed funds to boost year end results
---
- investors are indirectly speaking to the future growth prospects
---
In the later case, they know Blizzard's cupboard is dry. Another year of BFA; Overwatch 2's reaction was tepid and the Esports league has not brought in the sales/demand/cultural capital Activision wants (given their huge investments). Hearthstone is in deep trouble both on the regulation front and on audience reception.
---
Diablo 4 looks promising, but its 2-4 years away.
---
Classic is literally the only thing that was a success for Blizzard this calendar year.
---
That's what he is saying. Whooosh
---
I used blade/orb when in dungeons and rod when questing because out in open world spirit is our most valuable stat.
---
vanish breaking was a thing but vanish breaking in PvE when you are not even in melee range certainly was not a thing
---
Warrior combat looks so odd to me because it lasts so long. My fights seem to be over one way or another in just a few seconds.
---
That's what I've been doing. And while I've been doing a little bit of life, all t he other mages in my guild have been outgearing me and getting extra EP for no-lifing wow.
---
I will never get the staff over them. So if you do want the staff, I think you need to no-life the game for the next year or two regardless.
---
Cleave is rough, just like heroic strike. All it does is rage starve you
---
Back in the day, the PvE server I was on (Runetotem) had tons of world PVP battles in the usual spots - notably Southshore/Tarren Mill. We had epic battles basically every day until BGs came out. Then it died. There was the occasional city PVP raid that happened, but not much. 
---
Best thing to do if you want war on a PvE server is start it yourself. Flag for PVP, get in a fight, call for reinforcements and hope word spreads on both sides.
---
And they still don't want to put money into making the servers better. yikes
---
I saw it droped in my second run while leveling :/ A warlock and a mage rolled for it, don't remember who got it
---
So yes, it exists but, is it that good?
---
Angry nerds are a trolls main form of sustenance, as 50% of the time they take the bait.
---
They don't have a 2h fury warrior?
---
Or a paladin that would rather be ret?
---
Now instead they have Hand of Standing at the Bank in Ironforge.
---
PS - this is why you have a token ret Pali.  It's also shitty to give it to a guy who's probably getting funneled loot already.
---
Not to mention it's boring. You gain a marginal benefit, but it's so small, why should anyone bother?
---
Craft truefaith and then drop tailoring for something that can actually make money. Once you get all the crafted BiS out of the way it gets easier.
---
Fishing is reasonable and pretty chill, just make sure you do it at the best times for the fish you're after, and in a good spot.  This will either be 12am or 12pm depending on what you're going for.  It's easy and consistent and can be done in short bursts or long stints easily. Also golden pearls from time to time.
---
Gathering professions will also net you a steady stream of gold.
---
Work the auction house. Figure out what people need, what sells, and when, and how the prices fluctuate. Ride those waves. Your own research is king here.
---
Bid on the items you need instead of buying out.  Yes it takes longer.  You also save a fuck ton of gold.
---
Buy items that will either have their supply reduce or their demand increase in future. Again, your own research is king here. If it's written on forums and everyone is doing it, stay away, you're likely too late.
---
Farm the princess in Mara, this can be done by a priest in any spec with run speed enchant on your boots. Bonus points if you can pick the herbs in Mara too. This is good when you need gold fast because you vendor all the drops.
---
Dire maul has been massively covered in this thread, so I'll not go into it other than this brief mention.
---
Levelling an alt is a massive time investment and an opportunity cost. If you're struggling to afford things now, that time is better spent making gold at 60.  Only when you have the gold/consumables you need banked do you have the time spare for levelling the alt.
---
There's loads of options available to you, just requires time investment.  Try them all out and see what works for you.  Be aware of market price changes and switch strategy if something stops being profitable.
---
It is a hypothetical thought experiment to convey the dramatic difference in profitability
---
Exptected runs to see it drop around: 550
---
Near certain drop at around: 920
---
It is in the game, the dropchance is just 0,5%.
---
Lol fairy tail is indeed a group of garbage people. Trash guild.
---
Wont be efficient just get dps and do the dungeon like usual
---
I don't know, looks good on paper I do want to test it out that's part of the fun :\]
---
What risks can a billion dollar company not afford to take that Czech individuals can? What does Blizzard have to lose? I'm confused by the argument you're employing, even if I agree with the premise it stems from.
---
Currently most speed run records are held by alliance guilds ‾\\\_(ツ)_/‾
---
Ah, yes. I apologize lol
---
yup, unitscan can be user to track absolutely any unit in the game.
---
Because it’s a rare item that sims high.
---
They said in their call that reach of wow has nearly doubled.
---
This means that as many people as were playing retail this summer, subscribed for classic.
---
Don't need tank gear. Also possible. Decent geared 60 shadow pri can solo farm 15-20 minutes per run.
---
Pretty sure it was from Fallout 1
---
I did this for 3 weeks straight untill today with my warrior and priest, multiboxing. Only Hard part was the spiders with their dmg increase taken debuff (poison), thank god for stoneform, and the sprider boss with his aggro resets.
---
This cancer ended today thou since I finally got that damn chest!
---
You can heal early dungeons with shadow spec easily
---
Cool, thanks. I'm probably half way to the droprate then.
---
During wotlk, I decided to try the fishing contest for my first time. Not only did I win the contest and choose the [boa ring](https://www.wowhead.com/item=50255/dread-pirate-ring) , but I also caught a rare fish and picked up the [hat](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19972/lucky-fishing-hat) as well.
---
Best is you to try it, the result will depends from your expectations and from your skills.
---
It was fun to go into Darkwhisper Gorge and see the blocked off instance portal to Hyjal.
---
Got it on my warlock its not good if ur affliction
---
Thats adorable you think that. But yes I can take that item and sell it or trade it within a few moments and get the item I need. I've played since vanilla, and even then it was BOE=need BOP=greed. Sorry not sorry, but you're wrong. You're taking the need/greed to literally. But god speed my fair adventurer. May loot not be ninjad from you and your selfless acts of greeding.
---
Yeah, it’s 50/50
---
so if someone needs something and can equip it there and then, even if they need to change kit about to make it work, get them to equip it and then swap back, it's then bound one way or the other, if they dont then they are effectively ninjaing an item, if they cant equip it there and then due to level restriction or what ever then you will have to have a little faith and if you find out otherwise then feel free to treat them like a ninja, as for the loot table argument there are plenty of items for all classes on the BoE lists and they all have near identical chance of dropping, if yours drops you are lucky simple as that don't stop someone else getting an item just because you didnt get what you wanted, thats just how luck works suck it up
---
Ummmmm that's exactly what he's saying?
---
 
---
Nice reading comprehension skills.
---
Does it proc on the initial cast of the dot?
---
Is broken tooth still the best pet? I thought he was normalized to have the  same attack speed as other cats later on in classic.
---
Extra strength does reduce the number of attacks you need to kill a mob. There's a lot of random variation in how much damage each swing does as well as how much hp/armor mobs have and each point of strength makes it more likely that you'll kill a mob in one less hit. Just like having more agility makes it more likely that you'll crit and need less hits to kill the mob.
---
Yes it is. But if you are healing a dungeon and did not say you would be rolling on a off spec item,then they are in the wrong for needing on it.
---
Yes but only on the initial and it seems to have an internal cd
---
With subs there is overheard consistently, not a one time small programming fee for creating something like a $15 mount. At the end of the day it is about profit, not revenue. I agree that mobile games are more popular
---
Could it be related to deadly poison/bleeds? I'm not a rogue but I noticed that my invis trinket breaks if I use it with SW:P still on the target.
---
Who cares, all content is always relevant in Classic regardless. I do agree they are going a bit fast but at the end of the day it doesn't really have any significant impact.
---
I hate to break it to you, but the number of subs they've gained from classic will 100% warrant stretching it into something more. 
---
I mean, where does your ignorance come from? Log into a classic server and head to a major city. Classic is thriving and Blizzard would be stupid to not take our money.
---
Absolutely not.  The only people pained by the current server lags are the streamers and their fangays.  Everyone else will be PvPing in 5-40man groups, not 100 v 100.
---
15th anniversary stuff and hallowsend have been going on in Live plus 8.2.5 since Classic launched.  If you aren't playing specifically for classic reasons and just want to keep doing your collections, achievements, etc it would make sense to spend most of the this last month in BFA.
---
It's not hard to master... It's probably lack of knowledge.  
---
That being said I'm afraid to tell a shaman because they will likely freak the fuck out on me telling them how to play.
---
I just do dm e jump runs with a friend and get 5x more gold and don’t have to deal with rnd groups
---
It's not on her wowhead loot table and I don't see any classic comments on the item listing. My guess is that it's not in the current phase.
---
Remember, it’s as likely you get it in the next 600 runs as it was on your first run
---
Sounds good to me! Thank you for the information.
---
anecdotal experience is anecodtal, but if we're comparing friend's lists...
---
BFA is Blizzard's take on 28 days later.
---
Thought the same...
---
This. The only people who argue against this logic are people who want the item for themselves. Greeeeediness!
---
THAT NOT HOW IT WORK, REEEEEEEEE
---
maybe... tbf these specific groups are pretty nasty unless you pull them accordingly and try to negate incoming damage by using LOS or interrupts.
---
me and my pugs had problems with these groups aswell in many of our runs just because the tank doesnt koow how to pull the mobs and where to fight them. ( and im a nearly pre bis resto sham)
---
Just hit 50 last night. Definitely didnt expect lvling to take this long with a family this go around lol. gonna be a night mare in a few days. its already terrible in searing gorge with skulls killing as they pass through or just camping while tryna level
---
I guess screw the system that was put in place to help alleviate bickering. And what's right or wrong is determined by the group, which I addressed in my previous comment. 
---
&gt;And pls dont explain your point
---
Really? After sarcastically saying:
---
&gt;good to see that other opinions on the topic are not allowed.
---
Oh and I never said that other opinions weren't allowed just that "needing because of gold" is an awful mentality. Which then I said *Unless agreed upon by the group in the beginning. Because unless you agree to something else beforehand then you automatically agree to blizzards way of handling loot.
---
If 2/3rd to 3/4s of the subscriber base is playing Classic over Retail, you don't think the board will say "divert resources to the successful product"? 
---
If there's anything I'll credit Kotick for, is seeing where the money is coming from and doubling down on it.
---
I have many times, maybe the problems is somewhere else. 
---
Yeah I could have the same argument with you, you doesn't seem partial on the matter.
---
Iam not arguing that you never experienced a 10v10 with lags, but clearly stating that every 10v10 and 20v20 are laggy is not true. 
---
Have a nice day, cheers.
---
Your paladins are lying to you.
---
Thanks for the feedback. Ive been doing the same as you and felt the same pain points. I didnt really think about the impact of NS vs EM. Ive made sure I help our mages get their water as they hit 60 so I can hit them up when I log every day haha.

Yea I wish they would update the model. Or give the option.
---
Yes yes yes
---
If you think that's all it is you don't totem weave properly. It's about knowing the distance of your buffs, which are up, if you have another shaman and what buffs they have active. Can you switch from offense buffing to defensive buffing seamlessly. Can you hybrid buff when needed, can you drop the right totems to prevent raid wide pandemonium like AoE fears, at the correct time as to not gimp tour entire raids buffs. There us a lot more to it than two button macros. 
---
Totem weaving effectively is far, FAR beyond a one button macro every 10 seconds, and if you ever played with a good weaver you would know that.

As a level 39 Dwarf Warrior on a predominately Horde realm, I *really* kinda hope they don’t fix layering quite yet. 🙃
---
I mean, nothing in the current content is actually that hard, Ony has been downed by 20 druids without much issue. In this case the PUG was having a bit of trouble. Realistically, that pala only provided the fire res aura for the tank grp and BoS for all DPS in the raid. That was enough to let a bad group finish the job.
---
It's not necessary, but it makes raiding a lot easier. And might actually matter more if we do get to harder content.

---
They need to get to phase 3 as soon as possible.
---
Phase 2 is pointless. IT's not real pvp. World bosses have mostly garbage loot besides for casters.
---
We are ready for BWL/Bg's and it wouldnt surprise me if phase 2 lasts like 2-3 weeks because people get bored of it even if they did fix servers.
---
They don't think it be like it is
---
But it do
---
Currently wow classic takes me one hour per week to farm for pots, 2 hours for mc and 2 hours for onyxia. Including the time required to get to the raids after grouping up.
---
I end up spending way less time on classic than I would on retail if I were raiding there.
---
Ok. I dont feel as bad then. I knew the tank, obviously with it being a guild group, but lets just say....there is a lot of learning still to happen for that person.
---
Going deep resto helps you cover other people's mistakes a bit better.  If you get several things aggro'd onto you and no one is helping out, with 5 in healing focus you likely won't be interrupted on your heals and can save the group.  If the group dps is very low, you can still heal sustain with lower rank healing waves on a tank stacking healing way.  Mana Tide totem can also slightly help, but I find it mostly meh for going that deep ( the 5 points you have to spend in restorative totems feels like a complete waste ).  
---
However, if you're mostly going with competent groups who won't be doing things like popping blood fury as soon as they pull aggro off the tank, ignoring adds on the healer ( or letting the healer take aggro in the first place ), or doing slow dps / multiple party members tanking so your mana pool bottoms out - then ele/resto is great.
---
Also, healers aren't necessarily in demand ( at least on my server ), I assume because the only "viable raid role" for many classes is healer.  If you can also go as dps, that means you can fill 4/5 party spots and spend less time waiting to get in parties and get shit done.  As a bonus, when you're with a competent group you don't need to be standing around waiting to heal, and can spend your excess mana on doing damage to end encounters quicker.
---
So in essence, you won't be holding back your dungeon groups, but if they fuck up you will have a harder time covering for them.
---
That the argument that Blizzard is rushing wow classic because mooo DM was so fast is stupid and only shows how egocentric Americans are :)
---
You do less damage against raid bosses hombre
---
Did a BRD with a mage who was doing this crap. Rolled need on a BoE green staff worse than his blue he had on then equipped it. Then rolled need on a healing power item against our healer. The healer won. But I sent the guy a message and what not kindly asking him to read while sending a message to the healer saying sorry. Then the mage rolled again on a healer weapon that he won and equipped like it was better or something. Told the party leader to boot him since we didnt need the mage anymore and he was gone in an instant. Finished 5 more bosses as a 4 man and the healer was able to need on some nice SP items the mage could have used. (He was a baddie anyways and just needed to use him for AoE to princess.)

---
Yeah, look at that big ol' Spoooooooooooooooon
---
nope, I main rogue and have been playing quite a lot, its unreliable currently.
---
It actually feels better in PvP than against mobs.
---
Iam talking about management method like Agile, Scrums or SAFe for instance
---
lol many would
---
How about bonerfart?
---
Coming from ironman osrs terrible droprates is nothing new to me. I just wanted to know if it actually could drop, cheers ;\]
---
True but not sure they see it this way
---
I too caught it on my first cast in WotLK. My friend used the revive account cause he kept wanting me to come back. Said he was fishing all week for it, so I joined him and bam first cast got it. He didn't speak in Vent for a solid 2 hours after that.
---
There is very little evidence so far of that. We will see when shadowlands releases but I am not buying into the hype.
---
Yeah drop rates don't seed, you might go 5000 runs without seeing it.
---
Nowhere, make friends and start wars.  This is the way.
---
People might be answering their net worth instead of liquid gold. With epic mounts/some boe gear/profession mats and so on 3000g isn't unrealistic.
---
And if you are 60 and just do a dungeon or two in the evenings you will get like 50-100g a day just "casually" playing. So people that have been 60 for over a month and are still actively playing can easily have this much cash.
---
There's no way they keep P2 going as long as P1.
---
Thanks.  Still unsure what songs i am allowed to use for copyright reasons.
---
Yes classic is a good tool for bringing in new players that otherwise would never even look at retail and you're arguing that they're going to stop doing that not only denying themselves that revenue but also drying up the source of new players.  And in your head that somehow makes sense....  I'd still like to place a wager on tbc being rereleased because I have complete confidence in my logic.  How much is your confidence worth?
---
It was only hyped due to streamers on the beta. blizzard did a very small amount of advertising much too late, nothing like the amount of money they spend to advertise their new money printing expansion every year.
---
What's new about Shadowlands leveling system?
---
Whoever puts up 1000g in mats gets it. Everyone is fine with that and it's been brought up for everyone.
---
So far the only person willing is a tank who plans to respec for pvp during weekends.
---
 I don't really know what point you're trying to make with me, I know that retail will probably make more money overall, my only point in this thread is that they're still going to do TBC Classic because it's free money, and to think otherwise is delusional.
---
So does everyone else. Get back to me when you throw out everything in your life that was made in china.
---
But it's a mage only item.
---
That's what I said, 3 million was the increase from MoP into WoD.
---
12 million was the highest total.
---
How the hell is this in any way an attack or a harassment?  Get a grip.
---
Dude, the discussion was on twisting ef with grace of air. In your comment you described shaman as a class, wtf are you talking about. Stop being butthurt and stfu.
---
What class combo are you using? Mostly been 3 manning the runs
---
I wonder if schurke translates to the similar word in swedish - "skurk". That'd be silly as hell. Would translate to "crook" or "scoundrel" or something in English.
---
&gt;The fireballs clear aggro on the hit target (or if multiple on the one with the lowest ID) but there is no aggro reset.
---
Did you read my post?
---
I said the fireball clears aggro.
---
You're not farming for your BiS, you're farming for gold.
---
Honestly, yeah. This is a once-in-a-lifetime drop. No matter how many people run Maraudon or whatever other dungeon this can drop in, these two items will not drop at the same time again. The odds are just too minute.
---
The longer the fight the more she reduces the MT's threat due to wing buffet as well. So it's nice to have 3 tanks and when she lands pop recklessness to try and get the aggro. Worked a few times for me, but sometimes she wipes 20 people before getting to the tanks.
---
i'd probably stop playing at the end of TBC, or maybe play Wrath through to Ulduar but eject shortly after that. Argent Tournament was a speedbump, and while the Lich King raid was pretty good its definitely the end of the 'golden' era of World of Warcraft IMHO.
---
Even TBC introduces some problems: flying; heroics; tier tokens; optimized quest hubs. Not overly problematic in the context of TBC, but carrying those mechanics forward into future expansions gradually degrades the experience.
---
More so just to get an idea if this is popular on other servers. 
---
Just curious; would you rather pay a tank or have a tank reserve an item?
---
Your friends are experiencing boosting by the patch pushing them to be caught up.
---
Your gear in this time is invalidated, and unless you have the support structure that you currently do, you do not raid, and your progress doesn't really matter.
---
You're in a very good position for someone who plays so little in retail. IN GENERAL, this is not the case. Patch boosting is keeping casuals even remotely relevant, but if they dont do the grind to get the gear to look good enough for LFR, they dont do the content.Same thing for M+, it doesn't matter if the key is "easy" for most, no one is going to accept a capped player below the patch's equivalent ilvl.
---
Yes, we want the multibillion company to be able to run something a private server run by some Russian living in his basement could. 'Lag' isnt really 30 seconds, it can be couple of minutes where you are unable to move your character. Blizzard made Classic so scuffed with their decisions, people actually want to go back to private servers.
---
https://youtu.be/fYFD06UFscw Classic servers in this state would shut down if a fight like this ever occurred.
---
I got that damn drake in wotlk after 2mins. I was so unbelievable lucky in this moment. Till this day I actually can‘t believe it. Some guildies didn‘t have it to this day
---
Unimportant =/not care about that much
---
Having a tantrum over an item is simply sad
---
Start with crusader seal &gt; judgement, then use SoC/Righteous untill you can judgement again and just keep spamming SoC/Righteous. Then when you get low on mana swap to blessing/seal of wisdom for a mob or two to get it back - or ask for a ton of mage water before you head out to quest/grind for the day.
---
Make sure to bring consumables!
---
I use tukui and I dont know why but those no longer show up in the chat bar
---
Precedent*
---
The first name i reserved is for my blood elf paladin.
---
Same, I could not care less about TBC.
---
dude, we're not even going to be into BWL until likely January, almost 6 months after launch. we're fine.
---
Watch Skarms tanks guides for furry tanking on YouTube, he explains it very well
---
I don’t think you can skip every trash mob on the way to her at 58 like you can at 60 so that would slow things down considerably. Plus tank+healer is not ideal for her compared to kiting so you would have to be very good about avoiding the dust cloud damage.
---
Mana Potions and Dark Runes in Raids, the small cheap Potions in dungeons if needed.
---
Always prioritize totem twisting for your melee group over ego dps.
---
Rank 1 es for interruption rank 3 for some damage at a smaller cost, maxrank if you know you get to reg soon. Stormstrike is terrible in terms of costs, not using it to conserve some mana is fine.
---
Just depends on what you are looking for. I would say the big difference in the two is mobility and utility. Disc/Holy priests will pound for pound out heal a druid and have more aoe healing capability and shadow priests (in pvp at least) can burst way harder than druids can. However, druids have a battle rez, innervate, shape shifting which lets them adapt to a situation when needed, and the ability to provide some nice support dps in a pinch. Druid leveling is really fast and easy, but honestly so is priest leveling. 
---
Also, I think it really heavily comes down to whether you will do pve or pvp more. Priests really dominate pve healing (the other healers are great also, but priests are fantastic). However, healing in pvp is hard as a priest without help because you are super slow and have very little in the way of instant heals and defensive abilities. Druids on the other hand are amazing pvp support. They are damn near impossible to lock down and have great healing potential with their hots and big instant cast heal cds. You can out maneuver anyone if played right and in a pinch switch to bear to eat melee damage for a bit. Plus roots are crazy strong in pvp. 
---
Long type up, but I have played both classes in vanilla and over the years. I love them both for different reasons. Just think about their strengths and what lines up best with how you want to play the game.
---
I can confirm as I’ve said in another thread, all of my friends that came back moved to retail within a week
---
Blizzard can't really do much about it, other than handing out IP bans, and even that might not help too much.
---
Until the mention of resto shaman, I was going to throw my hat in there as an almost 60 boomkin. But filthy horde deserve to be rooted so they can witness the best dance in game.
---
I agree. The hype got to me for Legion as well though, but not as greatly.
---
You should try weed, all food goes good with it
---
They won't do that, it makes no sense. It obviously wouldn't be popular with the user base and it would cost a ton of money to create Classic+, which is why they're never doing it anyways, even without MTX.
---
Chickens don’t work :O
---
Maraudon with herbalism. Near 2 mush and 6 blindweed.
---
Killing goblin and princess. Rotgrip aint worth cuz sometimes he pull an add and you have to wait for him to get to goblin.
---
Fix bugs, but still release new content.
---
We need bwl/bg's like right now. Molten core is pretty much 2 months old at this point. IF you're not 60 yet, too bad.
---
Honestly, please do this in game, and need on a plate item as a mage. Do it. Stop being a pussy and do it
---
Kazzak has two mechanics which make just raw zerging him harder.  The first his whenever an enemy of his dies, he heals.  This includes warlock/hunter pets.  The other is a 3? minute enrage.  It's realtively short, but after that he just pulsing out shadowbolt volleys and people die quickly so he heals.  You basically have three minutes so it isn't realistic to try to zerg him.
---
Azuregos has a similar issue with the Emerald dragons.  If you die while in combat with one of the dragons, you get a debuff.  Anyone with the debuff who comes within about 60 yards basically get frozen until the boss is out of combat.  If you die to azuregos and try to get back in the fight, you will get frozen for like a minute, and the debuff lasts about 30 minutes.  Emerald dragons worked the same way.
---
For Kazzak an opposing faction, or even same faction player, can fuck over your entire raid.  Azuregos and the Emerald Dragons they can't really do it.  I don't remember opposing faction people every being punished for wiping someone (doesn't mean it didn't happen I just don't remember it), but I do remember it being punishable to fuck over people on your same faction.
---
MMOs have a terrible habit of removing all risk from the game as they evolve. Too many people want MMOs to be like single player games where you can set the difficulty level on EZPZ and be a god tearing through the world. That's fine in a single player game but it absolutely destroys MMOs. Looking back on some of the best MMOs I've played are the ones that had real risk involved or real challenges. You don't want to be a God in an MMO, you want to be a person struggling to get by next to everyone else who is struggling. Struggle builds camaraderie and strong bonds, fact. It's human nature. Vanilla WoW wasn't even on the terribly high end of the struggle spectrum but it had enough to form those bonds, while attracting people that couldn't handle the even more daunting trials of games like Ultima Online, Everquest or even Starwars Galaxies. Sure, you don't lose any gear or experience when you get ganked in STV, but that long corpse run is enough to make you want to win or take care to look over your shoulder. Same with engaging PvE content, don't pull too many because you're gonna walk half way across the map if you lose. I really wish someone would come up with an MMO that was built on the struggle again instead of making you a God next to other Gods.
---
Last night I was doing a quest and almost died. Some random druid heals me, helps me kill, lets me life tao till I'm full health/Mana, buffs me and my pet, and runs off.
---
This happens daily.
---
As a lock I also tend to dot enemies as I pass by, for Ally and Horde players.
---
It's like pass it forward all the time. And is completely different than my first experience in vanily.
---
2% Crit sounds a lot stronger tbh. 33 spell dmg isn't that much at that gear level and I think Crit scales better if you have loads of spell power.
---
They're much more likely to just do a TBC or WoTLK server than classic+.
---
Making a brand new expansion is a lot more work, especially when they're still making expansions for retail.
---
I get people hoping for a Classic+, but it's pretty much a pipe dream unless they abandon retail and create basically WoW 2.0.
---
What system? The need/greed system? Because how hard is it for someone to say "yeah I'll greed as well, don't worry" and then needs it after everyone else greeds it. Then nobody has a chance at it and it is completely unfair.
---
And wtf are you talking about with raids? For starters, there was a master looter system that counteracts all ninjaing (unless of course the raid leader ninjas which is uncommon), and that is most definitely not the reason retail introduced randomized loot like they have it now. As far as I know, they did it to try and elongate the time it took to get geared. And so that people couldn't do split raids as easily and gear people up insanely fast.
---
/roll isn't some out of game system. It is also a "system in place" that has its purpose...
---
Yes I have played since vanilla. Just because you think something is wrong doesn't make it wrong. But the majority agrees with need boe. God speed
---
I did the same with Frost oil back during the early mob of people leveling getting to badlands
---
What exactly am I looking for in raid healing to see how I’m doing? I’ve done Ony and MC quite a bit now and generally am the top “Healing done” while also being super low on the “Overhealing done. I mainly just use R2, R3, R4 of Heal. I mix greater heals and flash heals as necessary. Should I be doing something different or am I doing it right? I’m usually not assigned to anyone. I’m just considered a healer and just heal everyone as needed. For instance last night at Ony, according to my Healing done chart I did 58k heals throughout the fight, next closest walk 51k and then 3rd was something like 41k healing. Do these numbers even matter or should I take it with a grain of salt?
---
Yeah clipping is detrimental to a hunter, the higher dps from blastershot does make up for it, but they’re pretty much equal over time. If you’re a dwarf then blaster shot basically has 3% hit because of the racial, I would replace csc in a heartbeat if I were a dwarf and knew I wasn’t getting lead soon.
---
Not all deception is lies.
---
They just got guilds and tank for those now because their finally trying to gear raiders imo.
---
There has always been assholes online, anyone who pretends WoW classic was perfect and amazing is blind with rose tinted glasses.
---
Bear + pally heals at 60 skipping everything takes 7 mins per run counting 3rd party reset.
---
Going at 58, you'll need to fight more mobs and it will be slower.
---
Are you specced PI though? Currently hybrid between disc/holy and I've watched a few videos stating that PI was required for this or else you won't have enough dmg output to kill the lashers.
---
Ouch
---
Leveling was ok, story was pretty good though. The Suramar rebellion stuff was a high point and the Class Halls were fun. Granted, some of the Class Halls were really good (Deathknight and Rogue) while some were kinda shitty (Priest). Artifact weapons were really great, they gave your spec some new active abilities and traits. A lot of the traits were stat increases but some would buff your abilities to have new effects, changing the way you played the spec. Problem was that there was a really garbage AP grind you would have to do to power up your artifact and get those traits. The raids were kind of hit or miss. Nighthold was great whereas Tomb of Sargeras earned the nickname Tomb of Soak.
---
I wouldn't mind TBC if it were done differently. 
---
I like that they opened up the Ghostlands and Quel'thalas, but I feel like they mishandled the high/blood elves. I think they should have been neutral and available to both factions.
---
I also didn't care for the addition of flying mounts. It was fun for a while, but kind of made exploration at early levels a waste of time. 
---
The biggest offender, in my opinion, was the addition of Daily Quests. Having to log in and complete a laundry list of chores EVERY FUCKING DAY made me start hating the game too early in its life. I feel like they could have added something you could work toward that didn't make playing feel like a job.
---
I'm not sure. Details are pretty scarce at the moment.
---
GET OUT!
---
People have the critical thinking of a pile of leaves on this sub. It’s just a normal online community with toxicity and all.
---
Because server maxes differe based on the number of layers. Any server down to 1 layer has a lower capacity than Faerlina.
---
Big spoon is life.
---
the retail system has nothing to do with elongating the gearing time it is all to do with combating ninja looting, cant ninja loot if eveything is personal loot.
---
and its easy for someone to say you lets all greed i will do as well and then need, that called being a ninja and shit happens you report them to their guild leaders and you report them to the community as a whole through discord/sub reddits, back in vanilla all we had was trade chat so people are less likely to ninja now than they were back then.
---
and at no point did i make any indication that /roll was not in game i think you need to climb down off that high horse so you can see what is written more clearly i said you don't need to all need and then do a /roll as that system is already in place you're just overly complicating a system that is already there
---
female hunter?
---
Asking someone how they got to 60 in response to multiple questions makes you the "j.rk"
---
Play a smaller server
---
You can melee weave to apply procs and still use your range attacks.  This can make it fun.
---
Your melee auto and ranged auto are on different timers so you ranged auto/multi then run in and melee auto + double wing clip and step back out again for the ranged auto.
---
Depends on the encounter of course.
---
I’m in kind of a strange spot. I started on release, played to 27, quit until a few days ago and started on a new server and am up to 21
---
Enable or disable raw mouse input I don't remember which.  Also there's something about limiting foreground fps.
---
Also and this isn't something I had noticed until a reddit post pointed it out but if you do the rawinput fix there's some weird new bug where when you move your camera like 25% of the time your mouse moves across your screen too which is not what it's supposed to do
---
Gl buddy
---
The real question though, does it proc on mind vision?
---
On Atiesh Alliance side I almost never see tanks trying to charge for stuff.  1st orb reserved is pretty common, but the one time I saw a tank charging LFG chat got suddenly filled by tanks replying "will tank for free" and shut the charging guy up.
---
That sounds glorious :) Best I had was 6g, but still, if I get 6g/day with living -&gt; earth, it's better than arcanite. The only downside was that I paid 100g for the recipe T.T
---
Alliance has all of the records on this server. There is a reason the best guilds in the world are alliance. Horde is harder. Instances don’t care about faction imbalance. Numbers don’t mean anything in mountain pvp because ally run 300 deep on Tuesday and the game just breaks for pvp.
---
If I see this joke 10000 times, will it be funny by the 10000th time or is it still just an unoriginal overused turd?
---
I caught that. I didn't even know about it. Friends freaked out.  Then Cata made it obsolete.
---
Damn dude congrats!!
---
Nah Male. Just looks female, I think hes half way running in the pic.
---
Sadly on a different server
---
Australia: Where your mates are cunts and cunts are mates.
---
Yeah and how much do you think a big classic realm has?
---
Look at him
---
He's the captain now
---
I don't know how thw numbers work out but with a fury prot tank you should be fine to go ham
---
It’s 50/50.
---
Perhaps you should post this "massive bug list" you speak of. Afaik, they have fixed most of the bugs that became apparent during beta/ after launch. I am unaware of any major bugs still in the game and would be interested in hearing about them.
---
They said in an interview it'll be about 70 to 75% of the current retail time.  
---
So faster than current retail leveling.
---
I think this is only applicable to some specific mobs like ghouls, who see through stealth.
---
Why on earth do you censor the names?
---
I think it can but can't confirm, dont even think i have learnes that spell lol
---
Do you have this for every class? Link only goes to druid.
---
Doesn't matter: won
---
Mograine is cool, horde side atleast, alliance is speaking some gibberish
---
Yeah the tank in my run today was like "Are you cool with the book being reserved?"
---
The book you're not gonna see for 200 runs? It's all yours buddy
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu0-SwfmtgM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu0-SwfmtgM)
---
I'm actually switching back to daggers since I find sub more fun in wpvp, but it was too slow to level up
---
Well i guess we see why there's so much pvp talk on these forums
---
how
---
The gold question is irritating me while I stare at my stash of 67 golden pearls.
---
That is the major difference I think
---
Sure if you enjoy gambling that can make sense. Grow a pair. He asked what he’s doing wrong and I just told you. Now you’re all mad? Please...
---
Yeah... Blade of eternal farming haha keep grinding you'll ger it eventually
---
As a Warrior specced 31/5/15 Arms/Prot who specifically wants to offtank, this is the dream for me.
---
Either way it's still weird that your title doesn't match the picture
---
Look at the tooltip. It will say "not as good as the 2 ring." Yes, there is a 2 ring with some pretty awesome stats on it as I recall (that I think comes from a poop quest, hence the name...)
---
Layered. If a realm is still layered it means that it still has far more people on the server than just one layer can sustain. Therefore layered realms are a higher population than high population realms
---
Without been rude that's so incredibly ignorant of you.
---
If you'd read the post you'd notice I said it's the 30/0/21 spec, which is the "go to" ele/resto spec which allows for PvP and PvE healing.
---
Me as a fury warrior with most pre raid bis and my holy priest friend duo angerforge/arena. Sometimes arena is difficult depending on which adds we get at first, scarabs are kind of a pain in the ass. But doable none the less.
---
Healer can LoS before a sacrifice to make sure he doesn't get it. Bubbling sacrifice will reduce how much boss heals. Otherwise tank just taunts right befor sacrifice goes off, boss will beat on you while sacrificed. Healer might need to tank for a few seconds.
---
Layered &gt; Full &gt; High ... Etc is probably the best indication of server population.
---
Keep in mind that any servers that are still layered right now will have login queues when they are removed in a few days.
---
Ok, so not as slow as 1-120 but not as quick as cutting the levels in half and maintaining the same leveling speed.
---
Same for me. I assumed they increased the drop rate but nope.
---
If it’s an upgrade for me, I’m needing. If you expect reservations tell me beforehand
---
You can melee weave but your nightfall uptime will drop making the casters bitch when they check logs.
---
remember that fury warrs back in the day sucked baad
---
I think if you did a sperate survey for pvp and pve/rp servers you'd have drastically different data.
---
So you agreeing with me that American are huge egos by thinking blizzard should do the patch circle after one of their weakest customers?
---
America is still more a console country. Europe is more pc
---
as i have said a few times most groups i have been in have said if you need it then need, because as i have stated most people aren't ninjas and most people aren't so paranoid to think that every one is. if you feel the need to roll need on everything for selling for gold then you keep doing it and when you see something you need drop and you lose it to someone that sells it on the AH just know that its the system that you think is fair
---
That is a good combo.  Between Enchanting, Herbing, and Mining, you guys can farm some good gold out of there.
---
Thank you so much all! I went from being last mage to top 3 dps over all. Followed all the suggestions and obviously they worked :)
---
If you have enough mana (around 6.1k I think) you won't need PI, it helps but it's a requirement.
---
It's roughly a 3/10 funny.
---
Yes, however, you relearn by reading a book in steamweedle port.
---
2set boots/shoulders is also very powerful until full bwl gear.
---
Yep I'm used to LoS on sac, just wasn't clear when you have a partner how it functioned, but I am now!
---
If it was an upgrade i dont see problem here. Your Bis does not mean someone else cant need on it.
---
Yeah we sure showed them by making them richer...
---
None of that is hard and is basic shaman stuff.
---
If anything it's easier on enhancement.
---
Working family man here. I rerolled two weeks after release and am just about to hit 60 with half of my pre bis sorted. My guild has MC down to under 2hrs so I will most likely be in mostly T1 by the time phase 3 drops. 
---
Most casuals I know are already 60 and at least farming for pre bis or raiding. If you're not even 60, why does it matter? If you are 60, plan your gaming accordingly to achieve the best results. Remember the seven P's.
---
Sounds very efficient
---
Most other survey software requires payment / subscription for its services ... and almost 3k people have responded so far. So ... bummer you don't have a google account in the year 2019?
---
Aaah yeah, makes sense to make fun of trihard private server kids in a post where non of those were around/mentioned yet. And Pserver kids wanting no changes doesn't mean broken shit should be accepted? Like how does that even correlate.
---
This was extremely helpful! Did insanely better last night ty:)
---
Go Arugal for horde and Yojamba for alliance :)
---
Yeah because somehow 2.12 billion in sales just isn’t enough to excite people
---
"People only played on Nostalrius because it was free."
---
Imagine how dumb some people are, lmao.
---
At my server, so far the most common one is reserving one orb for the tank for strat live. The other tanking services are very rare.
---
You're just a jack ass that hates being told you're wrong. I'll do it again, you're wrong. Stings I know, but totem weaving is far more than just those 2 totems being replaced. It was asked "is this what totem weaving is?" To which I replied, "kinda," and then elaborated. You hate that your over generalization was wrong and you were told so. Get over it buttercup, and don't come at me about being butt hurt when you're the obviously mad one here fellow. I don't even understand how you got butt hurt from any of that anyway. You seem like you have an anger problem friend. Looking for confrontation where there needs to be none.
---
Sure, kiddo ;)
---
I was about to fill it out until it demanded I sign in to a Google account.
---
Thank you for the detailed response, as I said I'm new to classic so i'm still learning the intricacies of the game.
---
Would you say then for PvE reason's its beneficial to almost ignore critical strike in favour of +SP?
---
What about with healing, ancestral knowledge is a great defensive buff and I fish for procs using rank 1 healing wave currently, my thought was if I have higher crit chance I would get the proc more often, which would reduce the incoming damage taken meaning less stress on heals?
---
Feel sorry for healers now with so many warriors thinking it’s ok to run dungeons and OT raids without a shield. It’s doable yes but if you wipe even once it’s your fault not the healers as this version of wow was cookie cutter and tanks were designed and meant to be used with shields. I mean you can use your “oh shit” Cooldown shield wall without one.
---
Your mom so fat, chain lightning hit her 3 times
---
Anyone who says that things are dead on arrival are wrong. Things may fizzle out quickly for some games but nothing is ever doa.
---
That just sounds like buzzwords teenagers use to sound assertive or something.
---
This is a strange one, On my server people seem more happy to hand over 15-25g for me to tank a strath live rather than reserve the 1st orb drop.
---
However 9/10 people whisper me randomly asking me if i want to tank X (Say strath live or DME) and i say "I don't need anything from there, But i dont mind doing it if you pay X or i reserve first orb" they get really shitty with me saying "Wow. Charging to play your class, No thank"
---
I wish them well because i only run with guildies now as pugs just are not worth my time. 
---
So i guess it depends on the server, The time of day and how desperate people are.
---
I once had someone whisper me back two hours later saying "We still need a tank, We'll pay the 20g" (They had been spamming LFG and Trade chat for the last two hours) Now in this situation i was a bit of a dick and said that due to the time of day the charge was now 30g (This was peak time) and they paid. 
---
Soooo... Yeah. I don't think there are set rules. It just how much is your time and their time searching worth to each party.
---
First thing I did was take him through the desert before giving him a name.
---
https://youtu.be/Ndg0CjGdujA
---
Risk? It's a 50/50 chance, those are pretty good odds.
---
Yep, as it's classed as a nature spell
---
Blizzard offices - The greatest carnage will happen there. Or the server rooms.
---
 Un'goro Crater became a hotbed for pvp pretty quickly because the Devilsaur leather was pretty much a reward.
---
Well we have no real idea of the numbers leaving compared to each other, we can only assume. Even if game design is bad, the first 2-3months of most games doesn’t have a ton of players leaving. Even Fallout 76 kept players for that time length before crumbling, and it’s one of the most recent extreme examples.
---
I will agree BFA is designed similar to F2P in the sense it’s designed to have to log in daily and do chores to maximize your rewards. This is something missing from Classic that I like is not there. It’s good to be able to take breaks without missing out. Despite its flaws, WOD was good (imo) in that it enabled you to just spend 5minutes a day on garrisons then let you play other games or alts. But now WoW’s success is measured not in subs but in hours logged, so there’s chores galore.
---
However, unlike many F2P the store isn’t forced down your throat and you aren’t limited if you don’t partake in the shop. The only player power in the shop is the level boost. Nothing else actually gives you an advantage over those that don’t pay out. There’s no bonus exp, extra azerite power earned (a stimpak basically), etc. The shop is only mentioned in the launcher and maybe one pop up in-game when a particularly special item is released, then nothing else ever.
---
Mythic+ was primarily implemented as a means to provide challenging content for smaller groups and as a gear progression for players that are unable or unwilling to raid, not so much a bandaid for burning through content. Players wanted more smaller group content, and this is what came of it.
---
As for the “staged raids”, I’m not quite sure if you mean more difficulty levels or their release in stages. The more difficulty levels are just to accommodate the disparity in skill (or willingness to put forth effort) in the playerbase and provide challenge without being either stupid easy or ball-bustingly hard. For staged release, we get a 1 week leeway to learn fights before mythic is opened. Other than that, the only stages come in LFR being opened in wings. That’s just an excuse to keep the lower end of players that want the experience of raids without the effort (or the lore) subbed a little longer.
---
Imagine being so entitled to the point where you think everyone should only speak English
---
It's just a waste man.
---
I'm horde atm and this really isn't an issue for them.
---
I feel your pain. Back on Private server I lost Chromatic Carapace https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12871/chromatic-carapace to a druid. **A DRUID!!!**
---
Show me a "credible" source, then. I was rebutting to the information given.
---
But nah, easier to just be an asshole about it.
---
&gt; Zero evidence that TBC will be released. 
---
TBClassic is the most likely from a business point of view, they have already mentioned that it would be a fraction of the work of putting out Classic. So it's something they're at least considering. 
---
&gt; Not everybody would swap.
---
It's not certain that players would have  a choice. It's quite possible they force all of the classic servers to upgrade to TBClassic just as they did at the end of Vanilla. The best would be to provide a choice for people. E.g. optional server migration (perhaps even implemented via the dark portal for ultimate coolness). But from a business point of view, why simultaneously support 3 products (and in the future, 4, 5 depending on how far they go) when you can just migrate everyone from Classic to TBClassic and only support 2 products!
---
&gt;Code: this is an old version of WoW. It might not be as optimized, parallelized, or bug-free.
---
You do realize Classic run's on the same version that BFA does? Just different resources and probably minor tweaks
---
Buddy you don't know me, but it sounds like you are sucking your own dick here.  It's not that hard.
---
Ice veins and wow head guides are always very hit or miss. For the first month of the games release wowhead had warlock leveling guides saying to spec into demo with affliction and use voidwalker to 60, just as an example. It's since been updated.
---
Hey that's my cat's favorite spot too!
---
Explain it to me as if I were an 8 year old.
---
Totem weaving is not just keeping windfury and grace up dude I've been playing shaman since day 1 in 2004.i know what I'm talking about m8. 
---
TOTEM WEAVING IS ABOUT WEAVING ALL TOTEMS INTO CONGRUENT AND BENEFICIAL TO THE SITUATION, BUFFS.
---
 How do you not understand that dude? It's literally the fucking class, it's literally that easy to understand the term. Why are you so hellbent on not being wrong here? You are wrong, get over it.
---
Meh out of 10 of my friends who started classic, 5 made it to 60. And now only 2 play. The other 8 have either quit entirely or gone back to retail for the QoL
---
It's definitely a great belt for priests. I also had it drop on my mage and my priest asked if she could need it. I told her to go ahead but she passed instead. I wouldn't have minded.
---
dude all these accounts get banned really fast but they keep coming in with more
---
Or they could keep current BiS, but add gear that corrects the lack of options for some classes and specs. So instead of only Shaman healer we can get Damage and possibly even Enhance tank for them, for example.
---
I hear Boris Johnson wants to break away the horde onto their own server
---
What’s bre?
---
What a gnome-bro
---
Did it feel good to be of the rain?
---
Classic is good because it was made 15 years ago in a different world by people people with different mindsets.
---
Why you'd want 2019 Blizzard trying to shoehorn new shit into a 15 year old game (that we're all playing because their current game is far worse) is far beyond my comprehension.
---
Pretty sure it’s 18 hours/day or so, since you’re competing against all others on your faction
---
Just because you didn't intend to be rude doesn't make the comment any less rude. You could have easily asked something that wouldn't be interpited negatively such as "have you done mara before" instead of " how did you make it to 60"... I really don't see how you can defend it, no matter how ignorant or shit of a player he was.
---
I am 100% TBC. I think a lot of people are, that’s when I really went nuts with the game and I would sacrifice my life again for it this time around. My opinion though is a lot of time needs to pass with classic as vanilla.
---
English, they are management methods often use to produce It project.
---
This should be treated like an expansion though. The expansions were always marketed to bring back people who quit wow or bring in new subscribers who had never played the game. Classic has just done that far better than any of the expansions since the initial release of the game. That's pretty damn good. Additionally, I'd say it should be competing with TBC and Wrath as far as expansions go, those were the two big boys that would have gotten bored players and new players on board to subscribe or resubscribe. Anything after that sure, wow was a known quantity pretty much. If you didn't like the direction it had gone previously or the idea of the game itself you probably weren't coming on board.
---
I fully plan on playing TBC again, but I want the choice to continue progression through Naxx if they DO go with TBC.
---
Why would they care as long as they're all paying the sub cost and playing the one they want?
---
I tried many of the addons listed here, and finally settled on NugRunning. It's incredible. Try it.
---
This is a really weird attitude. Can I ask how far into the game you are?
---
And fury warriors now do more dps than rogues xD
---
&gt;is the new way of saying I ~~have an original idea~~ want easy karma points
---
Scarlet Crusade Raid

Classic Karazhan

Classic Uldum

Classic Hyjal
---
Played a lot battlegrounds and arenas as a rogue in vanilla through WOTLK . Played lock/rogue to 2195 in arenas when the top was around 2400. 
---
My primary role is disruption and to finish off low people (especially when they are trying to get away). First objective (especially in battlegrounds) is sapping a healer and separating them from their team, it puts their healers behind in the fight. I'll then open on a hunter who thinks they are safe to just unload but this is just to interrupt their damage output and I'll vanish after dropping their health a bit and probably go find the healer again.
---
If the opposing team has a lot of rogues then I'm usually just hunting for them (usually a bit behind our healers) , rogues can rip each other apart. I'll let them get started on our healer and will open with a garrote, they often don't realize I'm laying into them before the ks lands as the damage isn't big. Now me and the healer should burst them. Even if they blind and vanish, I'll trinket and sprint after them, generally it's game over. 
---
It's been said here earlier, having a full bar of energy for a kidney shot is big. I want to unload everything I've got and if it's a rogue or druid I want to get a bleed on them so the team sees them. 
---
I avoid warriors directly unless I'm protecting my healer. Well-geared warriors that know what they are doing will eat you for lunch. 
---
Good luck, I think rogues are one of the funnest classes to play in both pvp and pve.
---
Chain heal is the job of the shaman though.
---
I don't give a shit if you don't bind it, I've clutched raid survivals by using my entire toolkit smartly. I'm sorry that's a foreign concept to you.
---
Weird.  I definitely noticed the mana drain on the poisons while leveling if i wasnt in form, but in form it didnt seem to drain anything.  Maybe its just versus players?
---
Not related to your question, but when you get to the event itself, don't forget to enslave one of those bad ass felguards to tank the other felguards.
---
Considering, yes, but there is still a way to go before one could consider it. You're worried about a TBC release when Phase 2 is not even here yet.
---
&gt;It's not certain that players would have a choice. It's quite possible they force all of the classic servers to upgrade to TBClassic just as they did at the end of Vanilla. 
---
Zero evidence that this would be the case either. I guess that having a family prevents you from being more realistic so you have to rely on only the hypothesis that may support your point.
---
The stock market in the short term is much less based on facts, and more so based on public perception. For instance, beyond meat. 
---
Right now blizzards public perception is not good, hence the poor performance in the markets. 
---
Long term they will do fine.
---
I'm not so sure. I wouldn't step foot in retail, but I'm here and all of my friends playing are the same way.
---
:D
---
So in other words, 50/50
---
I mean, it's an American company producing an American game.
---
If there are multiple timelines to consider, why would anything other than the American timeline be top choice?
---
Also, I'm not in America. But good try.
---
I still think it's a step in the right direction. There were a lot of filler levels in the 1-120 grind where you received zero benefit from leveling up. Removing these dead levels, while making leveling shorter, will improve the experience.
---
Leveling on retail will continue to be a joke as long as heirlooms are available though.
---
&gt;Princess run is different because it’s 1 level 60 and 10-15 minutes with a high drop rate for the ring, so even on bad luck it’s like 4-5 runs for 50g, or good luck 10 minutes for 50g.
---
Unless you're me. Run 52 was the first time princess dropped the ring.
---
Mage only
---
They're going to be level sync'd like they are now.  I imagine they'll be just as hard to kill as they are now (so not hard.)
---
They also said the leveling from 1-50 will be about 70% faster than the current leveling from 1-120.  So it's really just a way to speed up leveling and get people to the new expansion faster while making the leveling content even less important.
---
The only real positive is that the leveling won't be quite as confusing story wise since  you'll stick to just one expansion the entire time.
---
I don't know you but I'm telling you what's going on in my server, get over yourself I don't need to stroke my own ego. I'm not like you, don't equate intentions. Qe are very obviously not the same.
---
Yes. With things like layering, server stability, and the community, private servers had it better.
---
Just like we did in Vanilla.  We played the game for fun.  We didn't pay for loot, we didn't reserve loot, we just grouped up to help each other get loot.  Back in my day...
---
So was HotS and we all know how that ended.

When vanilla launched it scrapped content to make release. Also they didn't have the chance to flesh out classes and specs. 
---
Classic+ is the idea that blizzard will spin up a new dev team, add those bits of content in/finish them off and add in tweaks to classes to make them more playable.
---
The whisper said "roles" as in DPS, Healer, or Tank. 
---
OP thought he meant "rolls"
---
The reddit survey shows that 50% of the people on this forum - wow enthusiasts - have not completed either onyxia or MC. 1/3 of the people on reddit have not even reached 60, and the reddit subscribers are at the less casual end of the spectrum.
---
I laughed pretty hard at this and now I feel waaaay too immature for my age.
---
The community aspect is why I resubbed to begin with.
---
I logged into my 110 Shaman one time just for nostalgia purposes, but haven't touched it since (or bought the latest xpac).  I'm perfectly happy tooling along in Classic, enjoying the ride and the company.
---
So people should just stop running dungeons for gear? It's normal to feel salty if the item you've been hunting for 15 runs is taken by a random who will vendor it within the next week because it was a bad item for them.
---
Because MMO's need to meet a minimum threshold playerbase.
---
There is no credible source... that’s the thing... it’s all speculation
---
...no the odds of getting the drop after 600 runs is much higher than running it once.
---
yes each individual run has the same odds, but 600 chances is obviously better than 1 chance.
---
Somewhere between 1-3 dps, and unsure of the others.
---
He isn't asking if he'll be taken away in handcuffs by using this addon. It isn't judicial in the sense that he'll be taken to a court. Or that blizzard will actually take legal action against him for using spy. More-so he's worried if blizzard will take (not actual legal) action and punish him. (again, not in actual legal way) How is that not clear? 
---
The English language is very flexible and certain words don't always have to be taken literally. Use your brains you downvote-hungry lames.
---
YES!
---
Some people farm for that belt for 20+ hours. You're just gonna take a belt that they will wear for another 6 months away from them for a marginal, temporary upgrade? That makes you an ass hole in my book.
---
&gt;WoW Classic +
---
You'd trust the current WoW team to develop Classic+?  They already had the code for vanilla so all they had to do was make sure things *worked* okay that's a current struggle
---
Ooo this is hot, thank you
---
It's the gaming engine and the world design.
---
No its not implied
---
How am I being dishonest when all you just did was expanding on what I said?
---
&gt;who is the most prepared.
---
And it's not like Gehennas has a shortage of unemployed people and hardcore guilds in the opposite faction, so why is apes winning everytime?
---
doesnt affect 2hand weapons
---
But that's literally the classic experience. No different than how half the specs in classic are completely unplayable. These crappy old features improved over time, and classic is supposed to remove everything good and bad done over the past 13 years other than basic security and safety features.
---
Most healing specs work well for PvP.  You have a few floater points that can be adjusted when you go full discipline.  It's more a question of gearing that you need to be aware of when you go pvping.  A set full of mp/5, spirit, and +healing is not a pvp set and will get you flattened fast.
---
In all my runs I only saw the gloves once and lost the roll.  
---
Although, two trash packs later a Dwarven Hand Cannon dropped and I won the roll on that, so suddenly my saltiness was gone. Well, not gone, but at least diluted.  
---
Luckily Dire Maul opened a week or so later and I got my Felcloth Gloves crafted, so I don't have to run LBRS again.
---
Yeah I get that you want that.
---
You just stroked your own ego for a couple paragraphs (if you'd use paragraphs).
---
It's kinda sad please stop.
---
I havent had any enormous super fights yet, but ive had about 60 v 60 ppl in BRM and only noticed a little lag, which is still much better than it was in retail.
---
Even AV was fairly lagged before the nerfs made it a PvE race. 30 vs 30 with lots of AoE caused a fair bit of lag.
---
Yup doing Fury with points into Slam. Better to have the ability to prioritize gear to different warriors considering I would be the only 2h warrior in my guild I will get prio on 2h weapons.
---
For sure dualwield is easier spec and easier to pull more dps.
---
Well fuck lol 
---
Thank you ❤️
---
Onyxia aggro was actually figured out in the classic warrior discord a couple of days ago.
---
Basically the fireballs in P2 will target the highest threat player, hit them for the damage and reduce/remove their threat on her. This fireball is of course AoE and can hit multiple people, but the threat reduction aspect of this ability will only hit one person. The way it chooses which person gets the aggro reduction is based on the GUID of each player hit. The person with the lowest GUID will receive the threat reduction.
---
We tested this last night for the first time and it worked perfectly with one of our holy paladins standing on top of the tank throughout the entirety of phase 2. The fireballs kept slamming into the tank as his threat wasn't being reduced, then the boss landed and was straight back on the tank.
---
Here's the log of the fight if you want to look: https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/xN1hZ63n4XHzQB2C/#fight=last
---
What's the add-on that is showing the debuff timers.
---
A sub gets you classic and retail up to legion, bfa will be included once shadowlands launches.
---
Good point, but all of those things are bought before I realised that China is so bad
---
How simple, yet Blizz won't ever do it
---
It's not though.  That's why I said objectively.
---
He was pissy but he's right. I would assume you need dps, not all roles. I don't specify the amount I need if I need all roles, I just say "LFM LBRS" whether it's just me looking to start a group or if I have 1 other person with me.
---
Ok, you get a special shaman medal, the shiniest shaman that nobody gives a fuck about unless wf/tremor/tranquil sometimes. But you do you man, you are the star of the raid with your shit reduce range dmg tactics XD. You should join apes  or method.
---
Private servers are not secure. Actions aren't validated heavily enough server side. They're a terrible example.
---
I think this is likely. I was hoping they'd drag classic out for 4 years, to force people who get bored of classic to play retail for a while.
---
But as they're talking about an accelerated cadence, it seems more likely they're treating Classic as an expansion/break from retail for the existing retail players. Rather than targeting classic at the players who came back for classic but wouldn't otherwise play retail.
---
Yes easily
---
Ok?
---
It can be made by all staff wielders
---
The stone guardians in un goro. The blue stuff they drop sells for quite some. Just kite around in a circle with frost shock searing tot etc etc. Works good for restos too. Basically any elites can be done easily this way.
---
TBC was really the benchmark for when most specs seem to actually play alright.  I skipped all of TBC and came back during the WotLK pre-patch but it was amazing how well Ret played compared to my vanilla experience
---
we're not in math class, I'm just giving gamers a formula to calculate it with
---
I find this accurate too, as a max level healer. Rogues can stick out by being clutch with distracts and generally good in dungeons. I have a few on my friends list and in the guild who I gladly invite to dungeons on the reg
---
?
---
I was there as dps not heals.
---
Or add haste as a secondary or something like that and offer items on the BWL to Naxx power level but with different secondaries, and as you say gear for other specs.
---
just ignore the idiots man

Zoomer vs boomer when they get their horse
---
I mean, yes, there is at least some new subscribers for each one. But there's also a large portion of the player base that never unsubscribed from the last expansion, they just keep on playing. That wasn't really the case for Classic, which is why they saw so many *new* subscriptions in one quarter.
---
It's not a figure of speech when taunting is a specific mechanic in the game you're talking about :P You'd be surprised how many people are confused about this. I've incorrectly heard ES being called a taunt more than once.
---
So yeah, taking this literally is combating misinformation for people. Don't call things taunts if they aren't taunts when we're talking game mechanics.
---
I’m not your cunt, friend
---
Are you guys old DnT members tho or just fans?
---
Are you healing or dps?  If you are shadow, blade and orb.  If you are anything else, rod.  The stats far outweigh any benefit from +healing in dungeons.  You will go oom before the +21 healing makes any difference.  So having more spirit and a bigger mana pool matters a lot.
---
Yes fixing bugs is a super unpopular opinion.
---
I feel sorry for dps warriors as well, when MT's these days start claiming that items like Onslaught Girdle should be tank prio because it helps their threath generation.
---
Meanwhile ret paladins are still universally despised and rejected for playing a suboptimal raiding build and needing on items which are bis for the top dps classes. #doublestandards
---
You can successfully tank any content in the game without macros. Source: doing it. It's absolutely more challenging, but it just requires game and class knowledge.
---
Turtles are basically shelled dogs
---
There was a pseudo LFG system in TBC, it wasn't great but the roots are there.
---
How much gph are we talking
---
+
---
The ideal solution to me is a reworked TBC. Change quests and zones around a bit so flying isn't required, and remove flying. Remove the level cap increase, add a couple talents, and provide players with a couple talents points after reaching certain goals. Reduce the stat gains on higher level drops to avoid power creep.
---
It would be a big job, but in the end it would provide the best product that will keep most people happy.
---
Monetize classic? That’ll go over well
---
Doesn’t the minimap display in every instance?
---
I'm actually stoked on the new leveling system, my biggest gripe with the current system is that I don't really get to enjoy the expac, constantly being overleveled for the zone I'm in (note, last retail play was legion pre scaling). Why finish quest chains when I'm already 5 levels over the content? 
---
I don't think it will change their philosophy of "current expac is the only thing that matters", but I think it's a step in the right direction of being able to actually enjoy the old content.
---
Oh and of course they wouldn’t even need new models, just some reskins for items/mobs
---
I'm only 31 though, hardly a boomer. I just appreciate good music.
---
(I actually think Old Town Road was a genius idea for a song)
---
What is the mount name? I want to see what it looks like
---
We can never find out but I'd wager good money that if it's between monetized classic or no classic at all, just retail, people will prefer the former.
---
Check the frame right before entering dungeon, I die.
---
Do you have the macro that shows the GUID of the entire raid?
---
How is 6mp5 equivalent to about 10 spirit?  10 spirit gives you 2.5 mana every two seconds when not casting and 15% of that while casting and 2.5 spellpower. It seems far inferior to me.
---
Imagine rolling on an English language server and refusing to speak English in the main chat channels
---
&gt;  You didn't explain AT ALL why "splitting the playerbase" is bad for blizzard.
---
LOL it's pretty self explanatory, you ninny. Leave me alone.
---
I saw this all the time, this isn't a new thing. Hell even as someone who can heal if I get whispered a lf a healer I say I will for 20g. You can hand me all unneeded drops to get to the 20g or just pay 20g outright, but I only take payment before the run, been burned before and it's a time sink for me when I don't need anything. Some people are ok, some don't like it at all.
---
What do you think Blizzard would do commercially then? These are the options as I see them, thinking in terms of revenue maximisation.
---
* Leaving classic set in aspic, never releasing TBClassic
---
Disadvantage is that interest in classic will wain and people will eventually unsubscribe. Not putting TBC out means they are missing out the opportunity for some additional subscribers (but perhaps not as many as they've seen from classic)
---
* putting out TBClassic (and potentially one day WotLKlassic)
---
Advantage of this is they've already said it would be cheapish to do, and it would give people something to do after classic content is completed.
---
Disadvantage could be that some people prefer Classic to TBClassic and they lose some subscribers. This could be mitigated by running both TBClassic and Classic servers, but this splits the community and adds maintenance/support costs. Maybe not insurmountable issues.
---
* putting out Classic+
---
This is the most expensive option. Also the most risky. It's not known how the community would react to new classic content. Would they enjoy it or not?
---
Fairy Tail on Zandalar Tribe seems pretty fun :) Idk how are people in other servers tho. I love the meaning behind Fairy Tail name.  
---
What is Fairy Tail? Do fairies have tails? Do they even exist? It is an eternal mystery, an eternal adventure :)
---
Seriously.  I sort of regret taking the Undead with the lifeless eyes and the shit on it's face.  I thought it was cool at the time but in-game I kind of want the glowing eyes and cleaner look right now.
---
But ain't no way in fucking hell i'm re-rolling for that shit.
---
Clearly your friends are not those who Classic is for. There are plenty of those too. And plenty of those who will stick with Classic.
---
Disgusting how?
---
Dunno. Check your ah for guardian stones, I think they're called. Iirc I could get like three or four an hour.
---
Approach it differently: what tools do we have that most other classes don't?
---
1. Reincarnation - Feign Death on a budget. Allows us to skip mobs by dieing and using ankh once every 40 minutes
---
2. Frost shock and Earthbind - one of the strongest kiting classes in the game, so melee elites are good for us
---
3. Earth shock, Grounding, Tremor - might allow us to solo caster bosses that are difficult for other classes.
---
4. Burst - not very useful for farming as it is mana intensive. Perhaps we are good at farming mobs that are weak, close together but not AoEable.
---
5. Ghost wolf - because we can pick up herbs without dismounting.
---
6. Ancestral Recall - with good timing you can travel back and forth between two inns every 15 minutes. I don't know any way to abuse this though.
---
Perhaps it's possible to find a DM farming route which makes use of 1, 2, and 3.
---
If not, perhaps we're a good class for kiting big elites and farming those for money.
---
If not, perhaps there's a place in the world that we can farm faster than frostmages with our burst.
---
Finally, perhaps herbalism is the best way to go. Or playing the AH.
---
You wrote "200 hundred" instead of just "200" or "two hundred"
---
As much as I'd like to take the coin flip, TBC brings Horde Paladins.
---
I know where that road leads too, and that's really the only thing I dislike about Classic right now, I can't play the class I did all those years ago because I swapped factions.
---
I'm ok with the "Classic Gauntlet" of expansions, even Wrath. But, if they just did TBC I'd be happy too. I'd be happy if Classic+ had Horde Paladins, and I wouldn't care if they went onwards with expansions or Classic+.
---
I'm a pretty huge 1-issue voter on this topic. Whichever gets me Horde Paladins in Classic style, I'm game for.
---
I got the turtle mount fishing one day, had no idea it was a thing at all. Apparently there was some achievement linked to it so everyone in my guild saw it. I started getting “you lucky bastard” messages and had no idea why it was a big deal.
---
More like 110 to 120 hours per week lol
---
Everyone i talked to skipped/was skipping Mara, got four runs in and got rotgrips mantle and noxious shooter and i think i got the resurgence rod from here too, not much else here for a priest except maybe razorlashes boots, forget name. Long and annoying dung like Ulda. Prob go back to quick zf runs for a bit or do a few runs of temple before moving on.
---
I see, thanks for the answer.
---
A similar thing happened to a friend and I, we were running timewaking dungeons when all of a sudden he gets a mount called “infinite timereaver”. We’re like okay wtf is that, and after googling we start oogling over how low the drop chance is on receiver one.
---
Half an hour later, a second one dropped for me. Still unbelievable.
---
I can do the same in shadow, do it all the time with guild runs.
---
So what you are saying is you don't know, and you don't have an argument.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Fury war is dps king, so stick with it if you want
---
roSe tInTeD GlaSSeS BRUH
---
Boomer is a state of mind!
---
It’s because it’s the only item with moderate value that drops reliably from a single dungeon that tanks have almost no reason to go to while most other specs have pre-raid BiS items from.
---
If there was something similar in Scholo, LBRS, BRD, etc. they’d charge a reservation on those items as well. If Black Diamonds actually had decent value, they’d reserve the hell out of them. Same for Dark Runes.
---
Rank 3 requires 5000 rating points, and the first week you will not have the 20% decay since you are starting at 0. If you earn enough honor in the week to be in the top 22.8% of PvPers on your faction and server, you will hit Rank 3.
---
He's fire you idiot. Git gud.
---
That might have been at Launch.
---
And we don't know how many People one Server had at Launch in classic. There were Queues above 15k on the first couple of days.
---
Then you can never be sure with private Servers. Those number could be completely made up you just can't know. They cerainly didn't have a lot of analytics on pservers.
---
Personally i believe this would be the best outcome. 
---
It would require the least amount of money from Blizzard, while offering change.
---
It would be a Classic+, with TBC added on.
---
Must be an alliance player if you think 1kn is bad.
---
It won’t stop the problem but it will definitely reduce it
---
Didable channel invites in settings.
---
Appreciate your thoughts. This is the best Reddit speculation post I've ever seen, most being tin-foil hat conspiracy theories. Yours is pragmatic. +1
---
I think Haste was a mistake, honestly. It's a purely internal stat that's caused hell for the game every expansion because it has to be devalued each level just to get back to where you are.
---
But, Haste might work if it's strictly tuned to level 60 and kept there.
---
Their reasoning is BS, but if you are playing as SW healer that piece is actually pre-BiS
---
Have you noticed the 2nd bug I described?  I'm wondering if it happens to everyone or only some people.  Also I had windows 7 and didn't have this bug until I got windows 10. All hardware is identical.  Do you have w10?

That's the point, I think questions thread is more important.

Kinda wholesome.
---
Any tips for going against rogues as a paladin?
---
I'm level 39 and recently had an encounter with a level 38 paladin. I felt so hopeless against him, with the constant stuns and stealthing when he got low. I got him to 25%hp but he stunned me and finished me off. Is this just a hopeless fight to avoid or is there any tips you guys have
---
That's some of my favorite content, fucking smooth brains lmaoooo
---
Tried for the crimson whelp, 18 hours and 3000+kills later still no whelpling
---
Neither. I think they won't do anything. IMO, there's only so much they could do without making Classic it's own subscription.
---
It should be working, did you check the config?
---
100% agree. Classic+ for me or bust. TBC was entertaining once, but I never got into it like I did classic. It separates the player base in too extreme a way. You all the high levels quarantined and it kills the mainland population. And even the high level areas have flying mounts so they feel dead too. Shattrath sucks. I don't mind new races, blood elves are fine, draeni are a shit race. I just want everyone to be in the same mainland, we don't need to add new capitals, keep the hubs. Add more raids/dungeons etc to the mainland, there are plenty of areas to be fleshed out that never got attention in Vanilla. I realize none of this will happen and they'll just take the easy path to TBC, but I won't be there for the journey with them.
---
Yes, the wording is a little misleading.
---
Lol. Presuming is all this subreddit does with these consistent “unpopular opinion” posts. Everyone’s a god damn server expert, layer expert, world pvp expert. It’s exhausting.
---
&gt; rush through classic
---
No one is rushing yet. Classic doesn't even become a complete game until phase 4. BWL, MC, Onyxia, and ZG all get run in tandem and give everyone more things to do. We already know that in the original vanilla most players didn't even raid, but in addition to that most players that did raid still hadn't defeated Rag by the time BWL was released and then it still took months to defeat Vael.
---
Classic WoW is not like retail. Releasing the next tier (aka BWL) does not make MC or Onyxia a dead zone. The sooner they release phase 3, the better it'll be for everyone in this game. Raiding guilds need more content to occupy more than 3 hours a week right now. PVPers need BGs before they quit in frustration either over the server's inability to handle mass world pvp or the faction imbalances that exist on many servers.
---
Do you not have an xp bar though?
---
Crit chance is weird for raids.  You can't rely on it for healing but at the same time, it can give a really good buff.  So while crit boost spells a ton, most would rather have straight +healing as that is easier to use and lowers the risk of overhealing.  If your heal would bring the target to full, you don't want it to crit.  And if you don't want it to crit, then you don't want crit %.
---
Fair enough, it’s like 2 years till phase 6 comes out though right?
---
Nonetheless, they've increased the size of the team on classic and are talking about accelerating the cadence.
---
What do you think their schedule for classic was before this announcement, and what do you guess it will be in light of this accelerated cadence?
---
It can be a couple of minutes depending on how fast you kill each other inside the lag.
---
Just because a pserver was able to do it on 1 Server. Doesn't mean that Blizzard has to be able to do it. In 2005 it was laggy as well. No one was complaining. No one would have complained on private Servers. 
---
Now People only complain because they know how it can be smooth. From private Servers. But you just can't compare 1 pserver to 100+ Servers Blizzard has to manage, Keep analytics, run anti-cheat, anti-hack, run other scan etc. 
---
There is much more going on than on 1 private Server.
---
Actually it's a 33.33% chance. Either none drop, one drops, or the both drop.
---
Also it's timegated so you can't really nolife for it.
---
Good, TBC had some good changes, and some real bad ones.
---
Good thing we all have different experiences, as none of mine have and are still logging in daily.
---
So you said, and I quote
---
 *" PVE stat priority is called a respec so you can do something useful like healing. "*
---
Yet now you say any spec can heal?
---
Again if you'd read the post you'd notice I said "when MC is on farm", I'm fully aware guilds wouldn't prioritise a shaman to be on DPS, but when a raid is on farm it's usually because the members are geared enough/accustomed to it to be able to clear without been 110% effort.
---
Also if the Hunter is Horde, then the q reward from Hinterlands is better.
---

---
My comments sounded a bit aggressivt which it really wasn't meant to be. My bad.
---
I have a level 60 and two 42's and a 31. Plenty o stuff to do, barely even touched DM because I just think it was released too soon.
---
Personally I think it would be more worth the while if you find a good warlock/hunter buddy and tag along with them! It's plausible that you can run a duo in there, but if the mobs are green and you're about a 5 yard radius from them, they will pull and worst of all the Dino dudes silence :/ 
---
They can solo them just fine, they farm their normal routine (I kill princess 5 times within the hour) but you're there for the ring. You can also find a hunter/lock and pay them 10-20g when the ring drops if you don't know any. The ring is unique so we can't carry more than one, so we often try to find people that can actually make use of it such as guildies :)

They've had 15 years, I'd hope they've leveled a bit.
---
BAHAHAHAHAH
---
sorry, i'm just picturing the chaos after that happened
---
&gt; Wow classic has very little max level content atm, everyone is bored and wants X to spice things up
---
This happens in every expansion of wow all the time.
---
I agree, 10 hours played per week should take the player to level 60 in 5 months. 20 hours per week is level 60 in 2.5 months.
---
Err, by subbing for Classic don't you already have a sub for Retail? :D
---
Dude but what if the cafeteria actually had vanilla ice cream like omg
---
WOW you're a loser.
---
If I mind control someone off a ledge and they die do I get honor?
---
It’s under his energy in the player frame
---
also just wanted to add, I don't think using or not using macros is enough to qualify someone as a 'good tank' there's other metrics that make for a good tank as well. 
---
My argument is that, if used properly, macros will make a good tank even better. You're getting more output for your input, less overall APM for the same outcome. For any given fight, dungeon, trash mobs, or raid boss, there's a finite amount of time that it will be alive. Time is valuable. Less time spent managing your action bars and stances is directly more time available for positioning, threat management, and overall situational awareness.  
---
If your argument is that macros make tanking, and warriors in general, less fun to play. Than there's nothing I can say to that. Fun is subjective. If you enjoy the tactile feel of manually changing your stances, using a desired ability, and the manually switching back, then there's nothing I can say to change your mind.
---
However, I like my abilities to be and my beck and call. 
---
Without keybinds and macros, what I would need to do in order to cast Berserker Rage from defensive stance would be, manually click on Berserker stance, click Berserker Rage, and then click back to defensive stance, all while hoping I could do that quick enough as to not exceed 25 rage. (with 5/5 tac mastery, anything past 25+ rage is wasted when switching stances)  
---
With keybinds and macros, what I would need to do in order to cast Berserker Rage from defensive stance would be Shift+mousewheel down to both switch stances AND cast BR, followed by Shift+D to recast defensive stance.
---
One is clunky and requires you to look at your action bar and physically click 3 separate abilities, the other is 2 macros and 2 key binds and becomes muscle memory extremely fast, with the added benefit of keeping your mouse free and your eyes on what matters, not your action bar.
---
Arena sucked.
---
I dont think we wiped but wasn't easy explaining to the group why i ninja pulled. I never use that dagger anyways now that i got anathema :)
---
Yeah they speak English on Mirage Raceway. However, my guild seems to have lots of English people, as well as Nordics (Finnish, Norwegian)
---
That's cute, and you're probably the one getting poles in your holes.
---
Yes you can. I healed up to 60 including LBRS as an ele spec, with int/Stam gear and the odd +healing piece.
---
I respected resto at 60 and went full 0/5/46 for the time being. Once BGs are released then I’ll respec 30-0-21 so I can heal and PvP.
---
Raiding is fine to, as shammy’s are on raid healing. Just make sure you have mana buff food and mana pots and you will be fine.
---
Screen size makes it hard to view details 
---
Layout of your buttons is super confusing, 
---
I can't even find out where your target icon is ???? 
---
Music is super annoying. 
---
Try instrumentals. Lyrics are taking away from your main goal
---
Stop
---
Seriously, guy saying this is iamverysmart material belongs in iamverystupid.
---
I'm still clinging to the idea of classic + not because I have particular faith in the current dev team, but more or less because I thought TBC was total garbage. So I'm willing to gamble on additional stuff added to a game I already like rather than just quit when TBC is re-released years from now.
---
Very good point made, I mean it's not free, there are serious architectural differences between Vanilla and Classic servers and even some functional ones, but it only requires a skeleton crew to operate, no artists, no designers, it's gravy all the way down.
---
I don't think they will, but I still want them to.
---
But if a player thinks it’s important to maintain that privacy then you’ve taken it away without consultation or recourse. What makes you think you have the moral authority to make that call for someone else?
---
Id quit in an instant that's for sure. Simply just not worth it if they change so many major things. First layering, then blizzcon ban and now this?
---
Sir..thats a red eared slider, goes in water unlike tortoises
---
It's a ragedump... still not worth speccing into.
---
If you want to use the asinine argument of "its on farm".
---
Then why bother asking anyone for a spec?
---
If the content is on farm, its so easy you should be able to do it without allocating any talent points.
---
If its that easy.
---
If you argument is that it doesnt matter..... well then it.... doesn't.... matter? That makes no sense.
---
So you don't want TBC then? Gotcha.
---
Doubtful. Dire Maul came out 5 months after original launch, it was 2 months this time around.
---
Not trying to beat the dead ass horse here but just follow my logic. 
---
Right now if you want to play arenas you only have one option. If TBC hits the markets, it’s reasonable to assume that a decent chunk of those who enjoy arenas would migrate to TBC, which as we established is the less profitable product. 
---
They do not want to siphon subs away from their cash cow. They’d rather let you squirm in your seat dreaming about TBC arenas than possibly move over another chunk of their core player base. Because in TBC, you can’t race change to mechagnome for those OP racials.
---
PET PICS ARE BETTER THAN STARTED BLASTING DIVITO MEMES. SO JUST LET EM HAPPEN!
---
but I wanna do hoodrat shit too
---
Surprised so many raiders play pvp servers. 
---
It sounds like a nightmare going into BRM. Or is this overblown for the most part and really only bad on a few “marquee” servers ?
---
Had a tank roll need on several things that were worth over 5g on ah because they "looked cool" supposedly. Its like, hope ya like that "cool" gear dawg, hope it was worth being blacklisted from me, the group and our guilds lol
---
No idea, never played wow before classic. Doesn't change the fact that everyone that did put the effort to clear MC has done it several time and we can now move on to more content.
---
That feeling when you solve a ridiculously convoluted math problem only to reread the question and it turns out you just misread something and its actually cake.
---
Theres literally no way priest has a "bigger toolkit" than druid but ok.
---
Remember that in classic int gear would increase the speed of leveling weapon skills.
---
oh shit you right, whever i say demo in my head I think "demolition" as in, holy shit i just got demolished by shadowbolts lol
---
never understood why it took blizzard so long to reboot classic. if you look at RuneScape, you can see that the "reboot" of runescape, aka old school runescape, is way more popular than their version of retail.
---
Congratulations, you're a dumbass. Everything is a waste of time.
---
Fuckin had a lock try to roll need on that ring everyone wants from the princess in Mara, Warrior won lol
---
I actually agree with you I just think all the moronic circle jerking on here about how they were wrong is foolish considering the situation.
---
You aren't enlightening me, you're missing the point of my comment. They can do whatever they want with their IP and I'm glad we can play old WoW again, but its an odd dynamic. We demand they make a product and when they do, to their success, so many people and go "Ha! I told you so!". As a player-base, its embarrassing.
---
HOLLA
---
GZ! 
---
You just created an alternate time line where Arthas survives and Sylvanas loses against him. We never get to the Shadowlands.
---
Achievement earned:
---
 You completed WoW!
---
I think OP knows this, he is just using statistics to say that after 920 runs, 95% of people would have received the item.
---
What he means is there's no point in him going there at all if not for orbs.
---
Some good ass idea
---
You're ignoring all the family men (and women) that have been raiding for weeks.
---
The mage reminds me of [Dragon Ball Super](https://youtu.be/cXZJoHCx8tU?t=149).
---
You know, I don’t mind the creative ones like this hitting 60. You actually made it interesting and definitely peaked my interest in other ways to use this. Where as people who just discover it normally don’t really add much. Good post.
---
Thats what I'm noticing too. In groups I don't do the dps a rogue warlock mage or hunter does but I've saved us from wiping by assist healing when the main healer cant keep up. And when people post the dps rankings boosting its like your welcome for the Windfury.
---
Warrior taunt is a threat top ability.  It puts the warrior at the top of threat of the target (Assuming the target is tauntable) and force the target to attack the warrior for it's duration.  People can then quickly pull back off the tank, but it does pump their threat to the top.
---
Candy crush has a way bigger market than wow. I don't want to get into a debate about who is a "real" gamer and who isn't, but candy crush is basically gambling which plays on human weakness to siphon cash out of people's pockets. Wow is an actual game, there are always going to be fewer people playing that than playing phone gambling.
---
I said "goodbye duskwood" when I moved on and someone whispered "fuck off"
---
I mean, a mount is also useful, and if I'm gonna be replacing it in less than ten levels, wouldn't it be better in the hands of somebody who plans to use it indefinitely on a twink?
---
Nothing in Leatherworking is BOP or requires the profession to use (besides Salt Shaker) so you can buy anything you need from other LWers. Engineering on the other hand is an advantage in PVP and PVE. Go Engineering.
---
I refuse to believe someone would leave chat censoring on by choice
---
I hate you (not really)
---
Cut content includes Karazhan, Beyond the Dark Portal, Emerald Dream, Mount Hyjal, Azshara crater bg, Grim Batol.
---
A lot of stuff is somewhat developed in the game files, but at some point in 2006 Blizz decided to make an expansion. Some of it appeared in the expansion, some was reworked later, some never materialized at all. 
---
Classic+ is continuing vanillas development by fleshing out that cut content instead of releasing tbc.
---
This eyes saw 25 tails in a row. Still that 920 runs will be a mystery.
---
TBC level 65  quest reward blue items are stronger than almost all naxx drops.
---
I was able to solo farm Baron for the skeleton mount on my Tauren druid with gladiator gear pretty easily.
---
Loot council. But we let our 4 manges who had been raiding with us longest roll for it.
---
#somechanges
---
No, the implication is that you only need filler DPS.
---
Dawg mages job rn frostbolt things to death and don't pull aggro.
---
Idk what your job is we have warriors and we have priests wtf makes you special
---
I work at a server switch for a ISP. People tend to oversimplify the idea of servers.
---
Hardware upgrades, something as simple as pulling a CPU from the server rack can take days to weeks to implement because if done incorrectly the entire server could crash and take months to repair.
---
And that is hardware, software is an entirely different beast and I don't work directly with it but I do know our software engineers and system engineers have to work closely together while rolling these out over the course of weeks to months depending on size. Most of ours a patched in, not complete overhaul of infrastructure.
---
Good catch! Didn’t see that
---
Pretty neat
---
Good Boi
---
I didn’t even play wow before classic, but I’ve been playing pretty much all day every day since I got it.
---
I finally understand that South Park episode
---
Videos will help for omokk. But basically you do the swiftness pot slow fall from seal of ascension guy to the ramp down to the first troll pull of thw instance, then run around the trimming at the top of the ramp, jump across to the trimming on the other side and reset mobs. Clear all ogres double polying to make it one ogre at a time, reset if neccessary. Then you kite omokk around the first trim you ran around casting arc missiles jumping on and off to have him run around a huge loop, keeping a poly on the adds. Sorry for wall of text im on mobile atm
---
Even getting in just means death walking once or twice, not a big deal for a 3+ hour raid.
---
I'm not talking about mechanics, I'm talking about spell names. So, again, figure of speech. And probably all the people you think are confused about it are not confused at all. Because, you know. Figure of speech.
---
OK I get that you're butthurt about the way I characterised you earlier. Sorry for the mental pain I've caused you.
---
Nontheless, we know from the reddit survey that only half of us have cleared onyxia or MC, and we're more hardcore than the player base. So it's only a minority of the playerbase, maybe 20%, maybe 30% that have been raiding for weeks.
---
In the first few days I had cornered my servers FAP market and had a guy wanting to buy 500 the first week.
---
The mats cost nothing.
---
One other question - can you move the default tooltip anchor location? Because it shows up in bottom right for me, which would be on top of your minimap
---
Tell your Mages, Warlocks, Warriors to stop trying to beat Rogues and Hunters in DPS unless they have a Gnomish Cloaking Device for P3. 
---
All your P3 problems will go away if your DPS without a threat reset tool (Vanish, Feign Death, Cloaking Device) just don't do anything for 15 seconds when she lands
---
That's hardly possible. Fully naxx geared players are already virtual Gods that kill fresh 60s in two globals. Another tier would hardly make this worse.
---
Is that in-game number factor in low level alts on the same account?
---
This shouldn't be a surprise.  PvP servers are usually the home of the most hardcore types.  PvP server doesn't mean that nobody raids - just PvP.
---
In terms of MC 2hers, it's better than Vendorstrike and every other pre-MC weapon.  It's also worse than every 2her than isn't vendor strike.  So it's probably like the 5th best 2her in the game right now?
---
Problem is, people have very little incentive to do new raids if you don't get any item upgrades.
---
ZG was run for the mount and the enchants, but AQ20 was largely ignored by high end guilds.
---
Old Blanchy? We have a death and taxes here
---
But classic is supposed to replicate vanilla. That gear was available to the vast majority of players when they started MC. Ragnaros world first didn't happen untill almost two months after DM release in vanilla.
---
Releasing DM when they did in classic is very compatible with the vanilla experience.
---
Which addon should be working specifically. OmniCC or ClassicAuraDurations?
---
That's why.
---
It can be pretty hectic going into BRM. I wouldnt use that survey as a judge of why raiders pvp, I dont consider myself a "raider" by nature, its just the only way to get good gear in classic and especially at the moment with no honor rewards
---
Seems a bit of a reach, ive been shadowspecced and been whispered to heal a dung and even after healing the whole dung no one said anything me needing on the bad mojo mask. Idk, seems quite a difference me needing on a sword or mace that someone *needs* and just because its better than my staff and can use it i need on it over me needing on a piece of item that affects me whether im holy or shadow. Idk, least its a item known to be used by that class.
---
Join the fight club discord and use their spreadsheet to see which combo is better.
---
What race are you? Bonus Weapon skill matters.
---
The more competitive the guild, the more likely you will be benched when others start to pulling ahead severely due to overall gearpieces.
---
You have to treat this thin line. 
---
For example I got myself:  
---
Flameguard
---
Onslaught
---
Ony neck
---
OEB 
---
for very cheap, because everybody is hoarding. Now two people hoarded *and* did not contribute to the guild by being online, helping out etc.
---
These people just got cut from the raidroster.
---
False. He has already blocked it in the interface settings, thats why its going to chat instead.
---
Drop tailoring.. the gold from tailoring is fair inferior than gathering professions.
---
There is no Holy-Power in classic my dude...
---
He must have updated the question because it clarifies to only say gold and not value of items.
---
Played hoard all through vanilla and BC, quit after that. Nice assumption.
---
I use OmniCC and I can see the duration.   I can't check my exact config right now, but I do know it works.
---
What I mean is that blizz isn’t going to tempt me into buying shadowlands or mtx on retail no matter what happens in classic.
---
So did you invite him?
---
/grats. You need a pocket slot to keep it in.
---
&gt; Hey, so, LPT, if you're gonna argue against someone, discrediting them with "I don't know what Blog post you read" is basically tantamount to name calling.
---
&gt; So don't do that.
---
Really? That bothers you?
---
&gt; Basically you're kind of wrong, and haven't shown you know anything about the game or how it functions in any replies. You've just pulled the "my dad works at nintedo" card.
---
🤔
---
You're allowed to be ignorant, but the moment you try to spread that ignorance online, you're gonna get called out on it. Don't get salty. Just get educated so it doesn't happen again.
---
And *definitely* don't insult other people if you're going to cry when it happens to you.
---
Keep classic servers intact. Merge most of them into a couple of mega servers.
---
The rest can move forward into TBC. But there should be a server permanently stuck in 1.12 Naxx phase.
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
From my experience it’s never a good idea for guild leader/raid leader and main rank to overlap.
---
I'm ready for TBC and then eventually Wrath. Give classic a year or so then give us TBC. I'll be done with school so I'll no life TBC for a week. Same with Wrath.
---
also exploitable, just bid all your dkp every time?
---
Yep. This is what creates we jaded fucks. And our don't-give-a-fuck attitude causes the users to hate IT. It's a cycle I'm a willing participant in at this point.
---
Do you use any of the Perl Addons as well? I feel like they are just not "playing nice" together.
---
I do only runs with sceptor. Its 6g average on loot/items and the rest is herbs. Usually it takes me 10m to clear princess plus gob and farm herbs
---
I'm on a server still layered. Often when raiding molten core on Sundays there have been some alliance camping Kargath. But not always. Surprisingly I've almost never had pvp issues in BRM. Neither when raiding or doing dungeons.
---
Is it starved for focus? Do you have too many focus dumps?
---
is that real? i go into weird places non-stop
---
&gt;But my god, I've never seen a more wrong opinion in my days.
---
I really agree with this.  From a playability standpoint, TBC is pretty much vanilla without all the *obvious* design issues that vanilla had.  I say this as someone who played more of vanilla than any other version of WoW and only played the last couple months of TBC.
---
My Ret Paladin felt fucking *amazing* to play compared to the joke of the spec in vanilla
---
I hope you are joking with that quote but I wouldn’t be surprised...
---
Yeah i saw 80 Vs 80 on the other comment. They should fix it before Alteric Valley thats for sure, but for now I don't see the big problem. I think it's very rare you have a battle with soo many people present in world pvp.
---
We know that servers count as full with 10k people on them. No guesswork needed.
---
You get additional spell pen from your gear already. Probably not worth having 50+ spell pen.
---
😢
---
Every guild is going to be different in this regard and really it's probably a culture thing.
---
I'm currently fury/prot (and raid lead) and i'm not even THINKING about putting my name in for those items until all my fury warriors have them. They do the biggest numbers, we set them up for success.
---
Dad???
---
spy addon is for pussies :D
---
Such is the life of a rogue.  It's unfortunate but the fact is that you are probably the most replaceable class.  I went through the same thing back in vanilla/tbc and since then have exclusively played healer characters.
---
Yeah I agree. To be clear I don’t think Classic is going away, just that it will not be expanded on.
---
No? If I set to setting 3 (classic), it’s the way it used to be. If people use other character models, that effects me too
---
We use DKP so there is a more guaranteed chance to get loot. Also I have been taking the weaker epics instead of the ones people beeen saving to cap for.
---
I only ever charge for tanking if I notice a group looking for a very long time on lookingforgroup or if I'm bored.
---
I am super broke and raid consumes and epic mounts aren't cheap.
---
Also, if I actually do need something from the run, like an item upgrade or something, I will not charge because then it's not really fair.
---
No, I am fully aware.  But I have no delusions of being a serious raider.  MC/Ony pugs are about as far as I see myself going, and maybe ZG when it drops.  Otherwise, 90% of my time in the game is going to be PvP, running 5 mans with IRL friends, or leveling alts.  To that end, 31/5/15 is kinda the perfect fit for me.
---
* Gets most of the PvP goodies out of Arms  
---
* Gets enough of the prot skills to easily tank 5/10 mans, and offtank raids  
---
* Does subpar but passable DPS in dungeons
---
I will definitely not be the best at anything, but I can do whatever I want without needing to respec, and that's good enough for me.
---
What can I do to ensure it is the first thing used? Both pets I’ve used had other abilities, one was bite and howl, the other was bite and claw.
---
Relevant username.
---
So your logic is, you have tanked some dungeons, and some DPS decided to leave before it finished.
---
Because this pissed you off (for some reason?) therefore, your only course of action, is to not pug, or charge to tank.
---
Or you know, you could just invite another one of the 40 million DPS that are waiting to join the party?
---
A DPS leaving doesn't stop the dungeon run, it will slow it down for a bit maybe sure. But thats about it.
---
It's like you've never played an MMO before? (an actual MMO, retail WoW is not an MMORPG)
---
Good luck doing an average dungeon run without a tank or healer however.
---
I feel like the set bonus for Prophecy kinda sucks.  -0.1 cast time on Flash Heal, big whoop.
---
I would absolutely welcome advice on how to choose one. I've tried going to their websites, tried talking to them on discord, tried joining because I grouped up with some nice people. Certainly it could just be a run of bad luck but I'm running out of energy to play the social side of this game. 
---
I'm also discouraged because even I can admit that there are too many damn rogues and I feel the likely hood of me getting a raid spot this late in the game is near non-existent. I have legit started on my warrior tank alt because I want people to treat me well again and that act of rolling the tank just highlights the pettiness that one must bend to if they just want to play a video game. It's a game about magical elves that turn into kitty cats, ffs, why is everyone so serious?!
---
No. Vanilla had these exact same lag problems in big battles. When I say they fixed it, I'm talking about years later as they changed their fundamental server architecture and game design to avoid the problem.
---
I always maintain that TBC is just vanilla with better class design, more shit to do, and a bad ass atmosphere.
---
I'm torn between the two, really. I loved TBC in most regards, but there were things about it I didn't care for. The introduction of flying mounts was all well and good, but I didn't like that they were eventually added to Azeroth. It should have been something that stayed in Outland.
---
I also didn't care for the introduction of Daily Quests. I understand that they gave people something to work for, which is something that most people want. But it turned the game into a chore. I get home from work and want to relax to a game. Instead, I'm greeted with more busy work. It's a system that I feel they could have gone another way with. I don't have the answer, but it's not what they came up with.
---
Going the route of "#nochanges TBC" would, in my opinion, be the beginning of the end, because all roads lead to retail at that point. 
---
I loved Vanilla, I loved TBC, and I even loved most of WotLK. But I'd like to see them done in a way that veers from the path that takes us right back to retail and all the reasons we wanted the original style of WoW back in the first place.
---
Like yeah we get it dude, you vape &amp; dont use any social media either
---
There is a spider...deep in my soul...
---
I'd stay away from doing dungeons as damage. At 60 you can pick up threat reduction talents if you want to PVE as shadow, but it's a waste of points for leveling. Without those talents you can't use mind blast, and probably not vampiric embrace, either.
---
I'm guessing you have a cat and have claw on autocast. It will use up all focus before growl.
---
Hahah I just noticed that!
---
Put everything on manual and fire it first. I do not use claw just bite and growl, it seems to always fire.
---
For Halloween this year they all dressed as their favorite character, Un'Gor'Illidan.
---
**Angry Moonkin noises**
---
My advice, read up on the deungeon on WoWhead or another site first.
---
If you don’t, my advice on a couple fights.
---
On this big lady, face her away from the group and have them spread out.  Be ready to grab her again after she punts you and drops aggro.
---
On the boss that breaks into pieces, have DPS switch to smaller pieces before going back to boss
---
On the final guy, kill adds until he is down to 25% then focus fire him.
---
Is there any way to show my wand? like to show weapon? also how to show weapon / off hand?
---
Run into assholes everywhere you go then maybe youre the asshole.
---
Level 43 here. 
---
If you talent improved VW and keep his taunt rank up, he holds aggro against any green or yellow mob like a champ, Elites included. I normally pull with COA, instant Corruption as i create a bit of distance then wand down keeping up corruption. If it's the same level you can throw up immolate as well, but 3 levels higher or more, it does tend to pull the mob off. Sometimes I wand for 2/3 hits while VW gets off his second taunt then i immolate and usually don't have any issues. Siphon life also tends to do the same thing as your healing generates additional threat. 
---
If you wand from a distance that gives you enough time to cast a clean shadow bolt, you can cast it right when you see the mob turn to you. By the time it gets to you it doesnt have enough life to do any significant damage. Throw in a life tap every now and again and you should always sit around at least 75% mana and health at all times if nothing unexpected happens. 
---
I found this to be extremely efficient. You can chain pull mobs until your VW is low on health, then use consume shadows while you loot everything. This also allows you to save your mana for when things get out of hand, which while leveling they inevitably will. 
---
If you keep your sacrifice rank up as well, your imp VW talent also essentially turns your sacrifice into a second healthbar. If you talent for Fel Domination, you essentially have 3 health bars. 
---
Wanding down also allows you to easily double check your surroundings.
---
I've tried succubus and though mobs do die significantly faster, i always find myself at 50% health/mana or less after only 2 or 3 mobs and need to constantly life tap and banadage. Also, when things get out of hand, you have no "ohh shit" button. Suffering and Sacrifice has saved me more times than I can count. 
---
Finally, remember that if your VW is holding threat just fine and nightfall procs, IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO USE IT. Save the mana and know you could have killed the mob a few seconds faster.
---
The "too fast!" people seem more triggered. I'm only level 5 because my two wives and 9 kids take up so much time!
---
There is nothing objective about that, it's a matter of taste and perspective.
---
"Water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen" &lt;- that is an objective observation.
---
"Water is the best drink" &lt;- that is a subjective opinion.
---
It's like going out in public and judging everyone on what you experience, some good some bad. Gotta keep looking my dude, my guild has 3 raid groups going and even hands gear out to people that are replacements for absent people
---
&gt; Now even more than before, because the pserver folks have 100% accuracy from the classic client.
---
Not sure about this, because a bunch of stuff like drop rates and boss scripts can surely only be approximated by private servers.
---
Probably one in each server. People are copy cats
---
I think people are making a bigger deal of flying mounts than they are, specifically in regards to WPvP.  Even by the tail end of vanilla servers were starting to become imbalanced faction wise and it became more about ganking than "WPvP".
---
And that might not be a negative. It would allow for anyone to plot a long haul for full T3 or High Warlord, without fear that they need to complete it in 2 years before the new expansion rolls out.
---
Only Alliance raids get tp'd out though. The Horde raids were left alone to camp and lag stormwind.  
---
Wouldn't want any Horde players to have a bad experience, they're the main characters, Alliance are just background characters. I switched because of this, and I hate blizzard for it.
---
Put everything on manual and fire it first is a solution but not a good one. I do not use claw just bite and growl on auto, it seems to always fire.
---
If gold is still valuable it makes pure gold farms more valuable than the counterpart of farming mats and selling for existing gold.
---
It means trading gold for mats is a good long-term trade if you are holding excess gold.
---
It also means that the expected early inflation of DM isn't as big of an issue as people played it out to be.
---
Sorry for the Waayyyy late reply, but when I joined y'all's raids it was as a Hunter named Fatlewtz. My buddies in your guild were Eggers (ret paladin) and Liokaiser(lock)/Sakura(mage)/HolyCrash(paladin).
---
You don't think there are multiple NEET guilds on Gehennas horde?
---
That's your opinion and I respect it. Do the same and all good.
---
May roll rogue just to have a shot at the warglaives...
---
But if P6 hits halfway through next year, isn't that just massive content for the average 2h a night person? Or am I stupid? I just like playing the game and doing stuff with like minded people. All the no-lifers will be Naxx geared and BG PvP endlessly or just move on to Shadowlands.
---
He did it. The crazy bastard did it.
---
Not really. "Classic", if we're using vanilla as a time period, ended with TBC's launch. Most video game companies started making clones of WoW at that point. Star Wars Galaxies basically ripped out its entire gameplay to try to copy wow.
---
"Classic" MMOs are things like SWG, Everquest and to a degree Vanilla. Vanilla actually started the themepark genre, but it had a lot of sand still clinging to it. TBC started shaking that off, as you say "more things to do". It's the game dictating what you get to do that doesn't sit well with players like me.
---
Bigger healing toolkit is fair, with better dispels, shields, and buffs.
---
Definitely a smaller toolkit overall though, no question.
---
I don't know about "best" but it's the fastest attack speed any pet can achieve.
---
Muh anecdotal evidence - you  
---
*My* anecdote is playing with friends I havent played with in many years and theyve all stuck around.
---
I'd put money on them releasing TBC servers, allowing character transfers from Classic servers to TBC servers, then consolidating the leftover Classic servers to maintain healthy populations. You could argue that it splits the playerbase, but forcing TBC on people who don't want it is going to cause them to quit, never releasing TBC is going to cause some people to burn out on Classic and quit, so maybe having both versions isn't as big of a deal as we think.
---
I think the default to unsheathe weapons is the “z” key, press it twice to get to your ranged weapon.

---
Kargoz did a 30 minute video discussing this exact comment.  Shaman/warrior and Druid/warlock are really strong.
---
I generally agree although I don't like the actual world environment of Outland.  I've always preferred the original Azeroth zones (and Cata ones too)
---
I have 2 pets I’ve tried on both, one is Ol’Sooty the bear and one is a Black Ravager Mastiff (Wolf/Dog)
---
That's not a bad idea and feasible since they don't have to worry about expansion sales (assuming it's free for sub revenue)
---
Your logic is flawed. The queue size doesn't imply anything about the server size.
---
For lag and processing power, only people which are actually logged on are noteworthy and those in the queue are waiting outside. Doesn't matter if there are 2k or 200k people waiting in line. The length of the line can't be used to infer how many people are online at any given time.
---
From what we know so far, the capacity for wow classic servers is around 10k.
---
What do you play when your GF exclusively levels hunters? I already have a Druid, but will be starting an alt when she starts playing. 
---
This is an upcoming dilemma as she’ll start playing in January.
---
I have a crazy idea you can even add some classic grinding while you do both those things!
---
Whoops. Not sure why I put seal of command at the end. Fixed. Ty
---
"most melee"
---
rogues need 1% from gear, you can get that anywhere.
---
Any raiding warrior worth their salt should be hit capped, and if theye arent they shouldnt be considered.
---
I key bind almost everything to the first 6 mouse keys, using shift, control,  and alt, to give me 24 keybinds. To keep everything thing visual as well I stack 4 bars of 6 on screen. First bar is normal keys, second is shift+key, third is control, ect. Move and turn with the mouse, strafe with keys. It took sometime to learn, but I think it works really well for my mage
---
Classic wow will require game time, which is $15 for one month. Make an account on battle.net, download the launcher, and then download the classic wow game. From there, pick a realm and create a character. I suggest reading all of the descriptions in order to find a class and race that best suits you. Goodluck and have fun!
---
They can only understand them if they speak orcish. They can also speak gibberish
---
Scaling is dumb, ruins every RPG that uses it.
---
Shazzrah seems to be behaving how you'd want and expect a European realm to do. 
---
The only stuff I see in general channels that is not in English is guild recruitment posts for language specific guilds. 
---
Haven't tried joining a group that communicated in another language or anything like that.
---
I agree. I think TBC was the high point of World of Warcraft, and I really look forward to it if it actually happens. I think most of the negative opinions will come from people who were dedicated PvP'ers though. Many feel flying mounts ruined aspects of world PvP and that's understandable, but the biggest issue that many seem to have was the addition of the resilience stat.
---
Was actually surprised to see multiple post echoing that other people went back to retail.
---
Though I guess the question is, are the people going back to retail the ones that were already playing retail and turns out do enjoy all the changes made to wow.  Or are the people leaving classic to retail the ones that rekindled/discovered WoW enjoyment in classic and went to go check out retail.
---
It exists. I've seen a warlock with it. I cried a little.
---
That's what she said.
---
This is literally not true.
---
Yeah one of the add ons puts the tool tip on top of the cursor. Don’t remember which one check out power hour UI on YouTube he has a template you can copy paste
---
God that last one has always struck me as hilarious. Reddit is just social media minus deodorant.
---
Both ideas are dumber than shit
---
So... people have actually run Mara 500+ times for that dagger? What is that, 100 hours? 50? It is worse than the MC dagger or Mageblade and only marginally superior to a spell damage / int blue. 
---
If it procs 2 times / minute you’re gaining 200 mana and dealing 200 damage and that’s about as good as Witchblade. I don’t think it’s worth all those runs, but maybe people value time differently?
---
No, there's no reason they cant do both, honor system should've been in with DM imo.
---
You can reduce DPS threat with tranquil air totem, it’s just wind fury is better.
---
As am I, my apologies in that case, may have jumped the gun there. I assume you have seen this alot then? In the years I've played Wow I have only rarely seen people spam etc in other languages.
---
I don't specifically have a timer as in giant numbers for my debuffs, but I do have them"blackout" as their timer decreases and I have my debuffs extra large on the target.  Not having a number has never been an issue for me, but I do know you can get it to indicate time remaining if not explicitly in a number.
---
New content in the style of classic would be amazing but when the current game director makes a statement so out of touch that it’s now the biggest meme in gaming (you think you do but you don’t), how can you have any faith in that dev team to produce anything other than total garbage?
---
TBC please.
---
I've only had more than 100g like twice, and one of those times was when I borrowed money to buy some plans on the AH (which I've since paid back). 
---
If I didn't focus so much on professions, I could easily have an epic mount, but I think getting important plans/schematics early on will generate more gold in the long run.
---
Hmmm that’s good to know!
---
The trick to those mobs is the DPS to nuke the shit out of one of the ghosts asap and let the tank get control of the rest. 
---
Those ghost packs are best handled by letting the DPS burn them down faster than they can damage the group.  Mana burns, silences, aoe volleys, its all awful.  The faster your group can kill them the better.
---
Or in my most recent case, I had a group of a fury warrior who despite having good gear nearly refuse to tank and 3 warlocks who had this lovely habit of life tapping down to fucking zero every goddamn pull expecing me to keep them at full life.
---
So no only did they refuse to nuke a target, one of the affliction warlocks was only doing 60 dps ... and had no pet out. 
---
So they kept dying to the aoe volleys as they life tapped their health bar away while I was struggling to heal our tank through these packs that were alive way longer than they had any right to be. 
---
Eventually I just stopped healing them because they couldn't be bothered to bandage or drain life or literally anything (including their only fucking role as dps which they didn't).
---
Thank Christ they did me the favor of ignoring me so I didn't need to.
---
Having more options isnt the same as the game telling you what you need to do. Nothing about TBC was themepark-ey, it gave you a lot of things you could get done and set you loose, just like vanilla.
---
I swear it's like you people don't even read the comment youre replying to
---
I’ll try that, thanks. Just frustrating when I pull off my pet constantly and he isnt even using his taunt.
---
Good luck phishing my personal data from reddit, im behind 7 proxies!
---
Why? Don't flag and problem is solved.
---
You make gold doing mara. Mara is relaxing as long as you ignore rotgrip.
---
God forbid someone has real life responsibilities outside of a video game.
---
Holla holla get dolla
---
You can't compare OSRS to WoW. Classic is run by a bunch of corporate cunts as proven by the horrible state of world PvP and just being out of touch with the community in general, whilst the OSRS team is very much in touch with the community and often comes up with things players never knew they wanted.
---
&gt;I've read some posts here and there about different kind of builds including a weird lawbringer 'seal of light' ret support build.
---
Which can be done by a holy paladin. I keep JoL up on basically every boss already. 
---
Retribution is too flawed to work well overall. With all the BIS AP-based gear (basically fury warrior gear), you have someone who deals decent white damage, decent SoC damage, but that's about it. No instant AP-based attacks to make good use of that gear, no damage CDs or situations where your damage is dramatically increased (execute phases in example).
---
&gt;the changes to the story in Reforged. 
---
What changes do you disagree with?
---
I actually did the visual 4/3 grid recently and that does help a lot. I'm just finding that it actually makes more "sense" to use the mouse more often than the keyboard, but it just feels very weird. Kinda like I'm learning to play all over again.
---
My point is that we have no idea what it'd take or how difficult it'd be for them, only that they have decided not to do it for whatever reason.
---
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.
---
You just gotta realize people on reddit come in two flavors. Dicks and not dicks.
---
Ask a question to try to improve yourself and your gameplay and people assume you're that asshole who's trying to pad dmg meters at the expense of wiping the group. Try not to let it get to you.
---
Check under mouse, make sure a hair isn't caught in the Lazer. Happens to me every once in a while with my pet hairs
---
Bitch, we got the game we wanted. That’s what money is for. To give to people who make the shit you really want.
---
Ret sucks.  He could probably do better than people in raids, but that's going to involve him simply being better than them or massively more geared.  There isn't a spec or gear combo that will make ret better than a similarly geared/skilled warrior or rogue or really anything else.
---
In general judging wisdom over light is better, but there are fights were light is better.  Most of the time neither are ever overly useful.
---
He either needs to accept that ret is garbage and he's getting carried, or go some form of healing.
---
You must be stupid to use top parse for comparison, those are heavy outliners
---
You should be rich being a prot warrior. Just start your own groups of Strat / Scholo and take all the orbs/unneeded, you can also sell runs for like 20g or more, some people even sell and also take greens. I'm not a fan of that but every tank i know has more gold than mages.
---
It doesn't matter, this has already been a giant success. Even if everyone literally quits tomorrow. Why is some peoples' barometer for success for classic like, "Well, people aren't gonna play it for the rest of their natural lives, just wait."
---
True, but a lot of those comments are "Just got my Benedicition" or "holla to my shadow priests", which I don't think really help anyone. I've never once found any Classy Friday helpful (including for my own class) because that information is readily available to anyone who wants to look, and because most of the questions being asked can fall under the daily questions thread anyway.
---
Yeah, fuck you too pal.
---
It's a video game, get over yourself.
---
It's okay for people to take aggro on skeletons while standing near the cave, as long as they don't do anything or move closer to you. Afaik they can even have thorns buff on them, which trivializes the skeleton part (until they die).
---
Haha druids are great. I had one ride past me, turn around, dismount, buff then ride away like some sort of buffing cowboy.
---
As a shammy I wish I had stuff to give out other than water breathing lol. At least I can throw a flame shock like you dot
---
Reddragon M901 I believe. The mouse software does have a lot of options, haven't really dug too deep into it actually.
---
I'm clinging onto the idea, but not the hope.  I think they'd rather reuse than create.
---
But I would like to see a classic+, the main reason is that a TBC with it's 10 additional levels renders the fantastic classic endgame dungeons and drops obsolete.  So i'd like to see a hybrid, where the cap stays at 60, there's no new levels, but we fill in some of the conspicuously missing zones.  Like Quel'thalas, Hyjal, Uldum, Twilight Highlands, that sort of stuff.  But all that is more work to retrofit them for classic.
---
Primal Fury + Omen of Clarity + Swipe/Maul spam = best AoE threat in the game.
---
Sorry, cancer patients.
---
I feel like compairing classic wow to your private servers are stupid af your pserver world pvp battles probably took most if not all of the population on the server and ontop of that there's a ridiculous amount more people on most realms then a single pserver.. So ontop of the huge brd battles theres thousands of instances being ran and reset.. 
---
So please don't even compare the two in terms of loads they have to carry..
---
I have mine as a cast and off auto. 
---
Works fine, inly issue is if I open up and crit my let might not hold the mob.
---
Eh, I loved TBC but it definitely has some major flaws. Outland is far too compartmentalized and it turned the old world into somewhat of a ghost town while most zones in Vanilla had some reason to visit them at the level cap. There were also more random standalone things to do in Vanilla like farming very specific reputations like the Winterspring Mount, Timbermaw or a lot of obscure recipes.
---
The atmosphere is definitely interesting but its definitely missing some of what Vanilla had. Just look at the Human low-level zones. Elwynn-&gt;Westfall-&gt;Redridge-&gt;Duskwood. They all had a very distinctive relatable element to them. They kept the scale of the story small and really resonated with people. I don't think anything in Outland did that.
---
That said I unironically think [this](https://external-preview.redd.it/giqZsG_GKg0oK7_aG5F7Cl3PJkaNHcbC5gJUyVCOZq0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=83349742c96a97d668899342e317a75db6d2f0b0) is a marvel of game design, Heroic dungeons were brilliant, and most leveling dungeons in Vanilla had poorly designed encounters with no mechanics and had far too wide of a level range which forced you to tackle them from either a hopeless or overpowered level.
---
Build them a Sulfaras and they'll still be bottom dmg if the rest of your dps is competent
---
statistics don't work like that its every time he casts there's a 1 in 10,000 your formula is pointless and invalid
---
People dont understand this. They see the AH price and think, "thats definitely going to drop and I want it." Somehow sitting in Lfg for another hour is more worth it than giving me my 2% chance and having me run you through 3 wings of DM so you can get all your 40% chance drops in a day.
---
I think the proc would be satisfying to see. I'm farming gold for epic raptor. I find mara enjoyable as long as you ignore rotgrip with herb and tinkerer.
---
Oh I didnt realize you chose to be a short person, and chose to be unable to loot off the top shelf. You picked rogue, lock, mage, etc. Their role is needed, yours is not... a cost comes with it.
---
Link to this?
---
Ha, Got ‘em...
---
Lol TBC wouldn't be out in a year.  Based on phasing and  history, TBC would be mid 2021.
---
&gt; I think getting important plans/schematics early on will generate more gold in the long run.
---
almost every BS crafted item is kinda worthless unfortunately, so no
---
It's not about funneling players back to retail because classic players and retail players are mostly two completely different demographics. It's about improving subscription numbers for the quarterly investment report. Classic is broken up into 6 phases, 3-4 months apart. They will get tonnes of new and returning subscriptions for each and every phase they release for what will probably be the next 2 years. At which point they have most likely planned to release TBC so to not exhaust the classic-player demographic.
---
They don't necessarily care if we play classic or retail because our subscriptions are still active all the same. They will want to keep it that way. And I can pretty much bet my left testicle that they will try to conjure some way to lure classic players into purchasing the latest expansion pack anyway. I don't know how. Might be a classic exclusive mount, might be included game-time, or as a requisite to get access to TBC servers. But somehow they will get us to buy it even if we're not really interested in retail.
---
I don't know about lower levels, but in the 45-60 range running ZF &amp; BRD I was almost always dps and it was fine. Just gotta wait a few seconds for the tank to pull some threat. 
---
Tank pulls -&gt; drop VE &amp; SW:P, then the usual MB, MF, MF, MB. Maybe start with a MF if you've been pulling aggro during the run. Haven't had many issues pulling too much aggro to myself. And if I do it's usually not a problem to just throw a shield on myself and run up to the tank. 
---
I only have the 3/3 shadow tree threat reduction talents, didn't take the ones in disc.
---
yeah looks very casual to raid naxx compared to farming MC.
---
I know tanks that do that too, just doesn't seem right to charge someone else so they can be graced with my presence. I know tanks are in short supply, but even if I was a healer/dps (and before now I've exclusively played melee DPS), I wouldn't be willing to pay a tank to come run something. I don't expect others to do that either.
---
We know that they are going to alter the story to give more spotlight to some characters and we can assume there will be retcons to accommodate the changes done during WoW to the lore. My point with Classic+ is that I can already see a lore-hero based approach to a potential new zone ("HELLO CHAMPION, I AM IN EVERY QUEST NOW!"), cutscenes, bizarre power levels between characters and so on.
---
It literally has nothing to do with your class.
---
This weapon is only for the status, so it matters where you are in your guild.
---
Just quit if you don't enjoy it
---
So do you macro and keybind it?
---
During mid-day times and other low server population moments, yeah.
---
I enjoy the idea of the main story be told in the wc3 reforged and the classic be the pov of the people who live in azeroth in this events.
---
And this can do a nice crossplay between this two games, imagine using your character in classic as a hero in wc3 reforged!
---
Ahh yes, add in another dps and wait 15-30 minutes for them to get there.
---
Tank or not, dropping group mid way through is selfish, why would I or anyone want to play with selfish people.  
---
Or I can play with my guildies and have a good time.
---
That's one of my points in favour of Classic as well, progression is something you can do at your own pace and you are not being left behind in 100 systems by not playing, just gear.
---
How can you put this much thought and pride into using two buttons, holy shit. Almost some /r/iamverysmart content right there
---
Dire Maul east for a belt. 9 INT, 31 healing, 6 MP5.
---
They're an idiot.
---
This subreddit is not hardcore at all and 30% of the active population raiding is a really good amount.
---
&gt;ok it turns out you're a penis after all. fuck off then, I can't be arsed to talk to you
---
You're the one who started insulting people who are doing better in-game, don't forget that.
---
We're actually dishing out a 150dkp bonus to anyone with proof that they have pre-ordered BFA. So far nobody has come forward haha
---
Wouldnt have it any other way
---
I don't think Classic+ is very realistic. They'd need to hire artists and designers for Classic+ stuff. 
---
I don't think they'd do that without selling expansions. Which is a whole nother can of worms.
---
There are discords for every class on wowhead, are you looking more for TC or stuff like goldmaking guides? There is a sub called woweconomy where you can read about that.
---
There's good eating in those.
---
When the repair bill is 9g+ for tanks, I can't blame them for wanting a lil something.
---
Thats my guildie getting rolled. Im so proud
---
Oh, just asking cause a highly respected pvp Druid runs with it.
---
If that's the world you wish to live in, go ahead. It's very libertarian - and that isn't a compliment.
---
so youre a human pve spec calling others carebears!?
---
He is probably just tired of people speaking out of their ass/repeating what their favorite uneducated youtuber/streamer said as fact.
---
&gt; actual numbers from Blizzard that suggest the opposite.
---
Where?
---
People paid for the Daily Heroic in TBC all the time. Same for WotLK. People paid for tanks (and healers) even more often when Looking For Dungeon was added in WotLK, because they would get an instant queue instead of having to wait 10-30 minutes.
---
Charging to tank is an overall benefit for the server. Tanks are in short supply and have very little incentive to run dungeons, especially with randoms and even more so with dungeons that don't have loot they need. However, pretty much every dungeon REQUIRES a tank to complete.
---
From the economic side of things: tanks can't farm, but they need money. DPS can farm, and in the course of farming to pay for a tank, they get items that they can dump in to the economy such as BoE epics. It's a simple system that creates items and keeps tanks from being poor as fuck.
---
Dont forget you can move your character by holding Mouse 1+Mouse 2 simultaneously
---
Wow what a pathetic whiny post.
---
I bet you pee sitting down too.
---
If you do get a roll-back on the level, let us know. That would be more humorous.
---
They do a lot to highlight themselves and the internal audits are a fucking joke. I don't think it's all smoke and mirrors but it's definitely set up to put the company at every advantage.
---
With old-school rs, they have a new dev team and they keep the game fresh with new content every few months. The game is nothing like the original game, but yet very different than the retail version
---
It didn't double sub count, it doubled quarterly growth. So if the previous largest growth period was 1m to 1.25m, then this quarter they grew at least .5m.
---
Sounds like you rolled on Horde
---
bad risk/reward compared to tbc
---
I can pull aggro off a raid geared tank with VE up and 3/3 in shadow tree, at least if some aoe damage is involved so VE actually heals people.
---
It's just annoying to deal with while leveling, mind blast has a high chance to pull aggro, dots are a waste of mana on trash that dies in a third of the dot duration, you're basically forced to only use MF until you reach a boss. Considering it's not hard to heal in shadow spec, there's a high demand on healers while leveling, and nobody would complain if you roll on damage gear, I just found it a lot easier this way.
---
Yes but best to just kite the dirty girl vs tank and spank. 
---
Warrior (me) and a pali buddy did 2 man runs for the ring. We were able to kill her in ~11min (includes walking in killing gobsr/princes and croc).  
---
We started at 59 when we were not doing a dungeon run.  Took a total of 11 runs to get both rings for us.
---
You wont even hit rank 12 in 12 weeks with just 40 hours a week put in, no chance in hell. 40 hours a week is casually playing when it comes to vanilla pvp ranking, try 80-100 hours a week.
---
Yes it is.  Survivability is a big issue in PvP.  It might not seem like much, but if you get attacked by a rogue/hunter who crit quite a bit, it can be the difference in living and dying.
---
People like trying to make pvp about all in burst and the highest dmg possible, but survival and control will win you more engagements.  Being able to outlast your opponent is usually more helpful than trying to blow them up in seconds.
---
This is pretty much my argument on why vanilla plus (should the release any new content) should include tier sets that cater to all specs. Dude clearly wants to play ret but is a literal burden to the other 39 members of his team.
---
I only raid for gear to use in pvp. I play an ele shaman. I’m typically at the bottom of the charts unless I get an ungodly amount of clear casting procs and crits. Guild is cool with me doing whatever as long as I keep windfury and fire resistance totems out all times. 
---
Unless that support build works, he may just be doomed. rip
---
I’m going to piss off some people but I’ll give my advice anyway. 
---
Find a guild that only has a handful of level 60s. One where the average level players in it are still in the 40s or 50s and are shooting for a solid raid group by end of year. 
---
Trust me, this guild will be full of great people and even though they will never get ‘world first’ they have a blast playing the game.  
---
Not saying all the guilds clearing MC now are full of the players you mention but...
---
am i foolish for just going holy right off the bat? i’m currently level 18, i put 5 points into wand, 3 into spirit tap, and now i’m going to put the rest into holy spec and heal me way up to higher levels
---
Will do.
---
Maybe a fun fact, (I presume) that the name actually comes form Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania
---
It's a hard balance. But they are catering to the no lifers such as yourself so I mean why even bother coming here when your getting what you want. 
---
 I figured I'd need untill Christmas to beat ony and MC. But by then I'll have hopefully cleared MC 3 or 4 times, I only work 4 days a week and sacrifice sleep and I can't even keep up I'm not even 60 yet lol. I cannot figure out how other working dad's do it... Well I have an idea but it's not well liked here lol

---
Haha
---
sorry :-)
---
Find a guild based on people that want to have fun as a group, not a guild that advertises stuff like "we aim to clear all content" or, hilariously, "10/10 MC". Those guilds will prioritize getting the raid done over ensuring everyone has a good time doing it.
---
Please tell me you were a hunter, too
---
Funny it's how many Hearthstone pros were the angriest regarding this incident, but following the Blizzcon apology they accepted it, and moved on. They are now promoting actively playing the latest Hearthstone Battlegrounds. Just ask Brian Kibler.
---
Not that many people are ok with buying a tank, but lots of people still do. Giving the tank unneeded its quite common tho, just yesterday i saw a Rogue LF1M tank  for Scholo and already reserving all unneeds for the tank.
---
&gt; Who is we?
---
I meant the overall player population. The average age of WoW classic is well into the thirties. The people talking in this sub aren't teens anymore, they know their stuff (mostly). There's a lot of experience here, some more (you) than others (me)
---
&gt;If you're including yourself, you haven't really said much about your work experience but I assume you have not been in any form of full time IT based on the NAS comment
---
But I've worked a ton with CCIE and CCNP. I'm just an automation engineer but today, automation is linked to IT more than I'd like. I couldn't sell WoW's performance to my end customers.
---
&gt;If your we is inclusive of amateur PC building type people, I would strongly disagree.
---
The "we" I mentioned is the entire playerbase which covers lifetimes of experience in several relevant fields. I would take your solution over mine but then again, you haven't given one.

&gt;A paid consultant in this situation would have access to information none of us have, which has been my whole point. I can't give you a best guess of any value because I don't have information to make a valid guess. I would say off the cuff that they are using some algorithm during PVP battles that has a poor big O which scales terribly, and if the big O is bad enough then resources just do not help past a certain point. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation
---
Every day is a schoolday. I learned something new, thanks for that :) honestly.
---
At least now we've got another angle to think about.
---
&gt;Someone else in this thread I believe put it well, wish I could find the comment right now. Basically just that if you ordered egg's benedict and you think it's crap, send it back to the cook, but don't pretend you know how to run a kitchen when you've never done anything but microwave stuff.
---
But it seems that quite a few people have figured out how to cook in the meanwhile. What you've ignored is that private servers exist. Other popular large scale pvp games have solved this issue. People have figured this stuff out times and times over. That's a valid argument IMHO.
---
And that's the gist I get from threads like these. We now know for certain that the cook who pretends to have 3 stars is a worse cook than most hobby cooks. At least when it comes to network infrastructure. Their surf n turf is excellent which is why I play the game.
---
I can't remember where I read this, but that has changed. They decided to keep it all original with the original voice actors and everything.
---
**Big O notation**
---
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.  It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann, Edmund Landau, and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation.
---
In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.  In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem.

I gotta agree with the obsession with logs and min maxing.  I hope you find a good guild that doesn't take itself too seriously.
---
Thanks man!
---
I'm not your buddy, son.
---
People seems scared that leveling is going to be a nightmare now.  Why?  High levels are going to be farming honor.  They aren't going to be farming lowbies who give no honor.
---
I ran a BRD where the leader hired a tank without telling anyone. We were all surprised when the tank "ninja looted" the first boss, only to find out that he was hired both for gold (like 10g) AND he got to need on everything that wasn't needed on by another party member. Full run of BRD, that guy made baaaaank. 
---
While I didn't mind overly much, since I mainly just cared about my quests, the leader went straight onto my shitlist for making deals like this without informing the rest of the party. He also begged people to chip in for the 10g at the end...
---
It sounds like you've been joining guilds with shitty people. Maybe I've been lucky, but I got into a smaller guild that's less flashy but is still 11/11. Leadership is great, members help each other, everyone is friendly, and turnover rate is very low.
---
I'm not your son, pal!
---
Poor tranquility totem, so forgotten.
---
Am I the only one that just wants to see more iteration on the difference between alliance and horde. I think TBC bringing Blood elf paladins and Draenei shaman was a huge mistake. If you bring TBC then you kill all that could be and we just travel in a circle. Think of the possibilities of using classic as a new branching pathway. They'll probably fuck it up but IMO its better than retelling the same story.
---
Now imagine the shelf is an hour away and 10 other short people are asking for things on shelves in different locations.
---
I want Classic+ just for new content, but I'm fine if TBC is released, too.
---
You don't have any numbers.
---
Who still clings onto the idea of tbc over classic+
---
Seems like you have to be priest to do that.... There's a correlation here at least
---
I mean call me wrong. But you 100% made it inside before you health hit 0 and it's easy to see that... Nothing is instant in wow and though you seen your health drop down at the end you were well passed the instance entrance.
---
There is a difference in advertising your services with a price, and somebody asking you if you want to do a completely usual thing and you demanding a price. If you can't see that difference, I don't know what good this conversation is.
---
[yes](https://youtu.be/NlMmqsccEf0)
---
I got the fire hawk drop on first try  and didnt know what it was because I was away from wow for like 3 years. I was just clearing  the dungeon to see what it looked like lol.
---
I stopped playing just before wrath. My buddies convinced me to come back.
---
What's wrong with peeing while sitting down?
---
The lbrs and strat UD crossbows are better and don’t cost 500g to make. Don’t waste your money on that garbage gun.
---
The “accelerated cadence” translates to the 6P vs the OG plan. 
---
The last report to stock holders spoke to doing the shortened phases. The plan changed and they formally documented it and tried to make it understandable to the share holders. Dont expect Naxx until 1/2021 at the earliest.
---
nah, that works, you'll be spending a lot of time healing instances and if you want to quest - which you will want to do some so you can get all the instance quest chains - you'll probably be better off finding a rogue/warrior buddy to run with (you guys would have zero downtime).
---
so?!?!?! just use the wow vanilla server engine !!! /s
---
Perfect! Which means, Tyrande voice actress with her original accent too.
---
A lot of the things people are asking for in "classic+" are things that TBC added/fixed. TBC is so much easier to release, too.
---
You think EverQuest can do it but blizzard can't?
---
Activision Blizzard is a publicly traded company. They are obligated (by federal law in some circumstances) to do right by their shareholders. It's naive to think that any company, publicly traded or not, would intentionally opt to make less money. If you don't like that then don't play a game that's managed by a publicly traded corporation because that is the world we live in.
---
True.
---
Theres dreamfoil and ghost mushrooms so you want to be able to gather that
---
Jesus slow dow lol
---
The quote is from a blizzard executive in a conference call to shareholders.
---
Ya it's the response to them telling us we didn't want it. Do you not have a phone?
---
I played hardcore in BC and WotLK, when Cata came out I quit. Just hated what they did to talents and the game in general. Classic is a way for me to experience a simpler time in WoW's history
---
back in the day, the only people really playing when it first came out were nerds that sought out this type of adventure back in 2006. nowadays, 'classic wow' is a meme that all 'gamers' online want to go try out for their own. 
---
its not the same at all. i feel it too. the only reason i'm still playing at all is because i got my gf into it. doesn't have the same nostalgia at all. which really sucks to admit.
---
I guess you can say that 😅
---
I am a teen, I wasn't aware...
---
Peasant caller bell is some spicy tech for that boss. It'll greatly improve your life.
---
Wrong.
---
Total server capacity doesn't depend on the number of layers.
---
&gt;the internal audits are a fucking joke.
---
The audit committee is a joke?
---
Do you know how corporate governance works?
---
Do you understand the difference between the audit committee, the external auditors, and the internal audit department?
---
Any guild that downs KT once won’t have atiesh. You get atiesh Adter you’ve already run Naxx a bunch of times. You can easily beat all the game’s content at that point.
---
Well ghost mushrooms are 245 minimum and a few of them spawn in there
---
Those comments always made me SO fucking angry lol. Yeah the 25-30+ year olds playing on a vanilla private server are only doing so because they care about 15 fucking dollars a month. 
---
Yup these adults with jobs are only doing this to save $.50 a day you figured it out.
---
&gt; Well I have an idea but it's not well liked here lol
---
what's your idea? Because if it paying a chinese to farm they certainly didnt do that. 
---
Also i might have have  a huge number of hours but you can do roughly the same by cutting the time in half if you are efficient, i was very inneficient and i liked it during leveling and so on.
---
Money + incompetence = trash
---
No money + infinite competence = trash
---
Money seems like a key factor too, friend.
---
Classic plus, please.   TBC leads us down the path that ruined the game in the first place.  I get the argument of "bUt YoU tRuSt ThIs DeVeLoPeMeNt TeAm To Do iT RiGhT?" No, I dont trust them to get it right, but I trust they recognize classic is a success for a reason and will work to develop around classic mechanics and gameplay.
---
I'm not clinging to anything, I'm voting for classic+.
---
He was rude, but it's not implied. Most people would prefer you stating what roles you need.
---
That's not what your previous comment said.
---
Did you get them?
---
False. It is and always was 100 %.  
---
Source: DeteRmIniS^m
---
Your verdict? BTW Wrath was pretty good.
---
Others have already given you solid advice.  I only mind blast to try and get the last hit for spirit tap.  Plus if you do pull aggro it is surely almost dead so can mind flay and hopefully it will die.  It's not easy to top out your dps because you can't go ham.  I see Spriest as an off-heals/off-dps, not true dps.  I have saved a few groups by switching to heals when our healer goes oom or dies.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dswpr6/honorsystem_amount_of_time_to_reach_rank_14_etc
---
Waste of money. Get Carapace or buy a Heartseeking Crossbow if you get sick of UD.
---
the leaker on 4chan who so far has been right on just about everything has said blizz are looking at a TBC and WotLK era servers too. 
---
so chances are they'll just do that once enough interest wanes. it seems to have hit a fairly stable point of longer term players now, but it's still at 10%-40% as to what it was during release depending on what search terms you use in google trends. 
---
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=install%20classic%20wow
---
OSRS went through similar things, the release grabs the players, the updates will keep them. 
---
unless blizz has a good plan for classic, it will just drop to basically no-one (look at OSRS graphs, OSRS was nearly dead in the water at one point.)
---
they're probably just going to net as many people back as possible with the era thing, i don't know if they'll have teams for each one or what, but maybe one account, join all, maybe allow players to move from one to another (i.e, join TBC era one with your classic account!) then release the WotLK later one with same idea.
---
I think 95% of the player base agrees this is too fast.
---
A sarcastic apology is not an apology.
---
&gt;It sounds like they're going to rush through classic, and target the pace of content releases at those without jobs, rather than those older gamers with families.
---
There are older gamers with families doing fine with the current pace. As simple as that. That's not a neutral description.
---
Jonny gets to see the back of dads head. Why read to your kids when you can read them the quest line lol. Wife cooking dinner again cause dad's gotta wow. Shit like that. lol
---
Pet level does not affect its aggro range.
---
I leveled my BT in strat and scholo
---
My GL is a hunter and our MT is the raid leader.
---
My alt is a warrior, can I roll need on handguards?
---
The troll thats at candice
---
If they start progressing thru tbc, wotlk ect then we get back to the trash heap that’s retail.
---
HARAMBE
---
Word. I loved Tyrande in WC3. Something has been off with her in WoW for a long time.
---
Ye, mainly speaking of last bosses since imo thats whats count.
---
I use this spec to pvp heal and raid. I'm at the top of the meters for healing done. [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsciqobxtcc](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsciqobxtcc)
---
Spiritual healing isn't that good, since it only increases your heals by the base amount, not the amount after spellpower.
---
&gt; fusing a 6 link.  
---
I've played PoE, and I can definitively say that doesn't happen.
---
More like, a group of 10 priests griefing in world pvp from a zone away.
---
Ah interesting point of view, I've been hearing about 6 phases for a few months. To hear about accelerated cadence, sounds like this is on top of the 6 phase plan.
---
What was the OG plan then, before they announced 6 phases? Do you mean the pace that they released classic in 2004-6?
---
Do you have any logs to link?  I can break down your pros and cons pretty quickly coming from the viewpoint of a hardcore raider.
---
Fear Ward and BoSalvation. It’s a bit like raiding with training wheels on.
---
It totally does.
---
You can, as long as you are in tight communication with the other players going for R14.  If your server is able to manage honor caps, you don't have to pvp for 12 hours a day.  The top bracket is for those who get the most honor.  Doesn't matter if you played for 1 hour a week or 100.  If you are the top honor gainer, you get the most RP.
---
Yes, just make sure your dps and can swap to sword and board if you get into trouble. 
---
Helped a budy farm his trinket from Glord and he helped me with arena and HoJ. 
---
Priest (holy) and warrior (fury) both of us are 60
---
Pressing a single keybind is faster than manually switching stances and then pressing a keybind. Sure you can manually switch and hit the ability and still be pretty quick, but that is more effort, not the fastest, and more prone to fat-fingering other abilities.
---
Honestly, I've seen more people leave during the leveling process than get to 60 and get bored in classic. It takes too long for the average player. They probably have numbers on when activity on accounts tends to slow down, and it almost definitely isn't at 60. 
---
They're different games with different focuses at this point, and that's okay. I like how in retail I can level multiple toons to figure out which one I want to play. If I want to re-roll in classic, I need to dump literally hundreds of hours down the drain.
---
I got the Baron's Mount and Blade back to back just before my sub ran out this past year, have been trying since pre-BC. Was pretty happy that I took the time to RP each confrontation with 'em.
---
Any advice on making gold as a Holy Priest at level 60? Farming mobs for materials is what I've been trying to do but its painfully slow and other classes tend to steal the mobs :/
---
yeah thats what he meant
---
^this. The game is called World of Warcraft, not World of Duelcraft.
---
Two are BoP. Chicken and Death Ray
---
&gt;Do these numbers even matter or should I take it with a grain of salt
---
Healing numbers dont matter. Now what does matter is having a low overhealing percentage while being oom right as the fight ends
---
No, I think he means the dude couldnt or wouldn't take time to help but finds time to screenshot it and then post it on here for all the reprobates to laugh over. At least that's how I understood it.
---
I'd bet my life that people who are having your same experiences have friends who have regularly been playing retail over the years. Of my friend group (9) who decided to come back to wow for vanilla, who hadn't played in 5+ years, 1 of them have quit, and the other 8 would genuinely rather kill their own mothers than start playing retail.
---
This is just not a good idea.  I'm on a pvp server and I don't want players from the opposite faction to easily find out what gear I'm wearing or what spec I am.
---
In BC my first timed ZA run resulted in walking away with the bear mount. My guildies ensured I was there for every run after that.
---
Why when there’s far better weapons from 5 man dungeons..
---
*Laughs in Druid*
---
Can someone tell me what the significance of this item is?
---
Gorilla+
---
imho the best leveling spec is 5/x/5 until about level 44. you can heal everything, you can frontload damage with holy fire -&gt; DoT -&gt; Mind Blast (-&gt; Smite), then switch to wand and let spirit tap pretty much always run it's full course, while killing as fast as possible.
---
priest leveling is fun as hell.
---
The runs you have already done are irrelevant to it dropping in the future.
---
This!
---
🤣
---
you could do this in vanilla idiot
---
I'm not checking his numbers (the 63%) but his equation is right (and very useful)! 
---
If you are making 10,000 attempts, you only need to succeed once.
---
So, the probability of *failing* n times in a row, if your chance to succeed is p, is (1-p)^n.
---
We only need to succeed once, so we want the opposite of that. If we don't fail n times in a row, we have succeeded at least once during those attempts. So, 
---
1 - (1-p)^n
---
Think about it in terms of coin flips; If I'm flipping a shit ton of coins, I'm more likely to get *at least* one heads if  I flip two coins than if I flip only one.
---
Flipping one, the probability is 0.25:
---
T H
---
Flipping two, it's 75%!!!
---
TT TH HT HH
---
Modeled exactly by 1 - (1-0.5)^n ..! 
---
It works exactly the same way no matter what your probability is, so long as each trial is independent (the probability doesn't change based on earlier attempts)
---
I didn't see the first post either, but you are like little girl trying to defend yourself here
---
Bone slicing hatchet is indeed a very good (and free)  optional weapon if you don't want to buy flurry axe
---
TBC was the highlight for me; Was in a top-50 world guild, great memories of pushing for new content on my ele shaman all expansion. M'uru still my favorite fight in all of WoW.
---
No, I'm not. been calling you out for the same thing the whole time. Your reading comprehension is just bad too.
---
The fact that so many 30-50 year old people (most WoW Classic players) are still acting greedy and arguing over imaginary items in a computer game is very very sad.
---
It's not that bad.
---
Not to crap on anyone who plays PvE, each to their own, but I just can't ever imagine it.  An MMO is a PvP experience, PvE is more like a co-operative game: "You versus the NPCs".
---
When I meet an enemy in the world, are they really an enemy if we can't attack each other?  Do I really have to just ride past while they gather my herb?  They can raise their factions strength and not a thing I can do about it?  That's not WoW to me.
---
Again, not to shit on the PvE'ers, but that's just how my head thinks about it.
---
Maybe this is a mindset thing but unless I ostensibly see two fighters square up and bow or something I'm assuming, especially when doing group content, that if I dont help the Horde some Alliance will come gank either way, and then what stands in the way of them killing me?
---
That says nothing about subscriber numbers. Just active people playing Activision games which includes all IP's.
---
Interesting that so many people have chosen endgame PvE as their goal and not PvP.
---
[Just because we're on the same team doesn't mean we're not enemies] (https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT8eCGuZcfnbGpE6ZmrqgtnnMvZ7hpLcffetipuucXdVIjg5Vak&amp;s)
---
None in classic!
---
Vanilla wow loot is simple.
---
Is the item that dropped an upgrade?
---
Yes?: Need
---
No?: greed
---
It's not written, but they said it in the call. Have a listen, the WoW segment is only like 2 minutes.
---
TBC signaled the beginning of the end for WoW for me and really ruined everything great about Vanilla. If that’s the way they go, that’ll be the time I quit.
---
What an idiot.
---
I think the point is that there's probably a sweet spot of the player base (something like the rough progression bracket with the highest pop) that should be the barometer for how fast the game progresses. The trouble is that, as far as I'm aware, no one has a clear idea of what is most representative. Is it 60s running MC? The 45-55 crowd? 
---
What I do know is that, from comments I've been seeing, there's a healthy population scattered all across the lvl 35+ spheres that probably makes everyone feel like their situation is most representative. That and personal bias.
---
Shortsighted, ignorant, and selfish.  Ladies and gentlemen, the behold the return of the Huntard!
---
LF 2 dps and Healer for partial BRD run
---
You are underestimating how many casual players there are that will get the minimum 25 kills but not be consistently grinding for honor.
---
We did mage/spriest while leveling. But the reality is that I'm being carried by my husband through out leveling.
---
I never realized that you could mind vision one mob then jump to another and another, until I hit that room.
---
I'd rather get the cape than the star TBH.
---
It took me forever to get the Star, rocked the Anastari Heirloom for many weeks, then ended up getting the choker of enlightenment a week after I got the Star.  =\
---
I have an opinion
---
Thank you.
---
Wasn't much of a challenge, honestly: https://classicraider.com/character?rid=53&amp;name=foo%20bar
---
I'm legit jealous of you right now.
---
Classic+ with TBC class design would be okay for me.
---
Cause honestly minor bugs don’t stop most people from playing.
---
Yep came for classic, stayed for retail. Love my free boost to get to endgame and the easy queue for dungeons and battlegrounds.
---
I still loved that the forsaken language is called gutterspeak.
---
ummm... tl;dr?
---
Can they add WSG to phase 2 as well? Seriously give us at least 1 BG. WPvP sucks and is just an unorganized zerg fest
---
Me warrior. 
---
Me like little word. 
---
Big word hurt brain.
---
Must go smash red name.
---
I know this was SM and not an endgame item but still.....
---
Had a couple of friends /guildies that wanted to run SM and we needed to fill 2 spots to get a full group. So I invited a cool priest that I ran with before and then posted a LFG for the last dps spot and picked up a rogue. 
---
We cleared Lib and the Hypnotic Blade dropped   
---
(26.8 damage per second)
---
+8 Intellect
---
+3 Spirit
---
Durability 65 / 65
---
Requires Level 34
---
Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 9. 
---
I was happy for the priest and gave him a “grats” just in time for the random rogue to roll need and justify it by saying it’s a dps increase. 
---
The worst part was the rogue was from a known top of the server raiding guild. 
---
In the end the priest won the roll, we promptly booted the rogue and got someone else for Arm and Cath. I told the rogue exactly how I felt about him and the way he rolled on an obvious caster weapon. 
---
4 days later I was in a similar situation and posted an LFG for a couple of open slots. Wouldn’t you know it the same rogue whispered me and said “I’ll go dps” 
---
To which I replied “ no room for loot ninjas, move along fool”
---
Hours later I got a letter in my mailbox from him, enclosed was a heartfelt apology and 15G. He said he got booted from that guild and was cancelling his subscription. 
---
If you’re out there Gankstagrim get back on WoW and hit me up. If you will listen and learn I will help you not piss everyone off and ruin your experience. Thanks for the Gold.
---
Reminds me of the 52 healing Pally who rolled need and took the (cloth) Ban'thok Sash from my Level 58 Warlock  (on probably my 20th Arena spam run) because he read the item stats too quickly and thought that it said +crit instead of +hit on it and wanted it for his healing set.
---
Can't fix stupid ...  Level 60 now and still no Sash with 30+ runs of Arena in.  At this point I am going to get a T1 Belt out of MC before I get the Sash I would guess.
---
Well, when your guild can clear Rag before the first submerge, the stress drops off significantly.  Once we start getting to the point where the encounters take longer and stress the raid more, it will pick up.  Although the challenge may be more about managing your mana to last the full fight.
---
Unfortunately, I can't use discord at work (IT security work), but the woweconomy one sounds awesome. Thanks =)
---
Yeah. I have been blown away by the level of greedy, selfish and just downright immature people in this game. I came in expecting people to be totally chill considering most are so-called grown adults, married with kids and hopefully a professional life. Have never been more wrong. Players in their late 40s arguing like little girls about loot and spamming fart jokes on LFG? The fuck is happening, lol.
---
RIP your money
---
The leveling process in classic is a horrible boring slog though.
---
I saw it was beconing popular and i wanted to try it, i had no nostalgia for this game, damn is it as good as they said
---
Most games run for a couple years tops and then disappear.   WoW is one of the few games that's been around for 15years, that's a rarity.
---
       
---
The thing they missed was that what they're seeing isn't just nostalgia, but the 2nd generation of people who want to play the game.   Younger folks who didn't get a chance to play classic the first time now can.   Most games are never around long enough to experience a 2nd generation or players, WoW is one of the few who did.

Hi, /u/JorbatSG

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dthkuf/someone_ask_in_raskreddit_about_your_favorite/). 
---
Class is irrelevant. It is usually given as a reward to the officer or player who helped the guild the most.
---
Since it takes about 15 weeks of splinters including a KT and C'thun kill, many guilds will not finish a single Atiesh before burnout happens.
---
As a warrior tank I would say that most hunters have 0 problems with their pets casting growl all the time, always.
---
If I cared more I'd have that much. I've made about 1500g since I started solo farming tribute a week and a half ago. 900 of that went into my mount, I already had some, so I'm hovering around 1k now after some recent goldsinks. 
---
I'm basically only doing DM now for mana pots, if I wanted 5-10k gold I could have it.
---
There wil be no fix. Just earlier battlegrounds why don't you people learn.
---
I would say the opposite. If a player has a BIS boe that they do not currently have. That means they value gold more than the upgrade, so you could make the argument that the other players would make better use of the gold because that player is not willing to invest in their character.
---
You're a priest, never leave instances. Find 4 mages and just use the brd prison exploit

Thank You for your post, we’re two person working on this project, design, website addon everything. If You would like to contribute, You’re more than welcome☺️

---
I played classic, rolled retail because I wanted to see what the game had to offer since vanilla(didn't even play tbc). Now I'm back to classic, because it's more rewarding and fun.
---
You didn't stop to think maybe it would be better suited for another class with the 21 frost spell damage on it? XD
---
Whitemane US? This is not a dead server, why do you perceive it as such ?
---
That’s some serious mental gymnastics you just did to not admit you were wrong. It would have been better to just say sorry to the warriors and admit you made a mistake
---
If your not going OOM mid-fight, and everyone is staying alive, then there are no problems.
---
I like how you seem to think less RNG = More Casual
---
fact is 
---
I am full t1, bored out of my mind, there is nothing to do other than raid log
---
It's two audiences, some like classic, some like retail. I have since moved over to retail, I found the game more enjoyable for a casual like me.
---
Horde or Alliance? This really does matter as Paladin/Anything is great and Shaman/Anything is great. Any class that can heal paired with a DPS or Tank class really. 
---
I leveled Prot Warrior/Holy priest and it was great. Yes, I know I didn’t have to level Prot and he could have leveled Shadow. Yes, I’m aware it was slower but we had a blast. There were lots of moments I wished he was a paladin though. Freedom is such a great spell to use on warriors as being rooted really sucks.
---
Why? I don't understand the aversion to Classic+, other than fear that they will screw it up. But assuming they don't, if you like Classic why wouldn't you want more Classic (not flying/level70/other expansion stuff, just new dungeons etc.)?
---
I only ever finished CCNA, but I'm not a pure networking guy, so you have worked with people more knowledgeable than me anyway!
---
As far as the private server stuff, I'm not ignoring that, that's probably the most commonly pointed out example in this whole discussion. The reason I devalue it is that, and again I don't have background info to KNOW this, those private servers are not going to be implementing the same computational checks as retail classic servers, be that anti-cheat features or just bug checking type things. Private servers will be concerned with just running, and probably specifically stuff like large scale PVP, to the point that they'll make sacrifices that Blizzard will never make. So in a sense it's very true that these private servers prove things like that are possible, but what are the costs of the shortcuts those private server devs undoubtedly took? It's not an apples to apples comparison at all.
---
The gems are not the money maker, you get raw silver as well as vendor greys.
---
The issue is the ability is not getting used when it should, or at least completely randomly being used.
---
GM/RL is a fury warrior. Very fair with loot distribution and somehow manages to notice everything that happens during a fight while nailing the fury dps rotation.
---
I think that since WoW is such a community driven game, there would be many implications (many of which I can't currently imagine) to splitting the player base in so many different ways, the most obvious being dead servers and even more tank shortages. I think you start with adding either TBC or Classic+ and see how it goes, then re-evaluate how feasible the smorgasboard idea is. 
---
I also think you're underestimating the resources that are required to maintain 4+ versions of WoW. I'd rather they commit all their resources to 2 or 3 versions of the game and provide a higher quality of service.
---
They aren't pushing new content. They're switching the honor system on.
---
Yeah I definitely intend to heal a majority of the dungeons I am in, this time we had a Druid who was two levels below me and she felt more comfortable as the main healer. 
---
I definitely dropped shadow form and off healed for two fights that went south. I just felt pretty useless compared to the warlock and rogue in our group as a DPS since I have no aoe.
---
Permaban warranted.
---
Give it a lick, it tastes just like raisins.
---
It's comparable, sure. Are they relatively close to each other? No idea, could be.
---
It got added looks like. That's definitely my answer.
---
I mean, I've experienced none of this.  There were shitty people and guilds in 2004, and there are shitty people and guilds in 2019.
---
Seconded. Warrior/Shaman is probably best.
---
They had massive populations. 
---
Why do people insist on talking out of their ass about this?
---
I’ve never had this issue in the past either it just sort of started happening and I can’t figure out why.
---
I really don’t tho.
---
You're the worst
---
\&gt;wouldn't you want more Classic WoW,
---
Do you believe blizzard-activision can deliver? If they could why would they keep releasing shit retail expansions while developing fantastic classic+content?
---
No, but part of it has to do with the fact that this is a relatively static game. League is incredibly dynamic, with every single game being completely different from any other game ever played, so something like that makes sense. In WoW, the information is documented, you just have to go searching for it. There have been SOME new theory crafting with the release of Classic, primarily with regards to how certain mechanics/bosses/classes differ from private servers, but for the most part it's a pretty well known formula at this point for what works, what doesn't, and why. Not to mention the fact that League is receiving regular content patches, which changes the meta constantly, but WoW will be using the current patch for all phase releases. Any concepts you can apply now will still hold true in a year. 
---
If you have specific questions, there is a daily advice megathread, but it's been un-stickied today for the census poll. I'm probably going to contact a mod and ask them to replace Classy Friday with the megathread, as I think it's far more helpful in general. 
---
Also, as a side note, I'd take a lot of what's on r/SummonerSchool with a pretty big grain of salt. I've seen some pretty bad advice on that subreddit, which doesn't always get refuted by the community.
---
ofc
---
how are you still level 35 lol. there are people with multiple 60s, the game cant wait around for the slowest player..
---
They recreated it closer to OG vanilla than classic in most cases.
---
You do 300+ dps as a tank on a single target?
---
#How Spirit Regen Works:
---
     13 + (Spirit / 4) = x **mp2**
---
After 5 seconds of no casting (of spells that use mana, so you can clearcast or use a racial and will still regen) you will regen mana per 2.
---
Channeled spells will start the 5-second countdown upon start of channel if 5 seconds long or less. More than 5 seconds will start the regen at the END of channel.
---
You regen while casting (cast bar) and will start the countdown as soon as the spell casts. (so you can time a regen tick to just before you cast)
---
**mp5 gear ticks mp2. 10mp5 = 4mp2**
---
Doesn't it require a KT and C'Thune kill along the way?
---
Well fuck me i got a shami to 60, raided, got bored, kinda back to ret but still raiding... And i forgot to visit Karazhan.
---
They still haven't fixed major bugs like vanish, enemies hitting through stuns, large scale battle lag, and players facing the wrong way when running. Yet they are releasing DM and now phase 2 with all these bugs still present. Its a bad move.
---
Roll a hunter imo.
---
The Spell-Batching "emulations" or whatever they've done have broken many spells and abilities or made them very unreliable. 
---
This is going to be extra bad when pvp is raging.
---
I was fishing in Arathi Highlands the other day.. someone came over to me and asked If I could help kill the elites for him since he couldn't find a group at that hour... so... 10 minutes later.. he had finished his quest.. and I was back to fishing.. Im 60.. he's 30-something..  And im a Holy Priest..
---
dumb
---
Thank you for this explanation
---
Did you not play TBC.or something? Your description of it is concerning.
---
I'm torn. I started playing in vanilla in like 1.4 or 1.5, but TBC was the golden era for me. I still have nostalgic flashbacks to TBC now and then when I hear certain songs, but not for vanilla. I love Classic, and I feel like I'd love Classic+, but I long for TBC.
---
Just curious what about TBC you want? Is it the exact replicated experience? Or is it the overall content? In r/classicwowplus there are many postswith ideas about how to incorporate TBC content in to a Classic+ framework. From the Outlands to class balance to lore, anything from TBC could, in theory, be included in Classic+. For me, the difference is the potential Classic+ has to offer. If done right (IF!), Classic+ could be everything I loved about TBC poured slowly on to everything I love about Classic while providing new content. Just keep in mind that Classic+ doesn't have to be just new dungeons/raids. The entire game could be remodeled in a way to promote an endless Classic style of game. Super optimistic, I know.
---
For real? My group got our 3 rings in about 12 runs. That's some baaaad RNG right there
---
Legit? I just got 22 and it seems like I spend my life waiting on HS
---
I'm from 2015.  Hate to break it to you, but We're never getting legacy Vanilla servers.
---
You think you want it but you don't.
---
I want either BC and WotLK and stuff changed after that, or some stuff (like death knights and said expansions' raids for example) put in the game some other way.
---
Don't ask how, I don't know either, all I know is I wanna do Ulduar/ICC with a dk + being interested in BC raids since I missed out on those when they counted as actual contents.
---
how would tbc work though .... would we keep classic and have tbc servers? that would split the population even more ...
---
Yeah your DM runs are totally comparable to endgame content.
---
Mong.
---
&gt; the likely hood of me getting a raid spot this late in the game is near non-existent. 
---
Lmao wtf.  The game came out 2.5 months ago.  It's not late in the game at all - we're still in the formative phase.  Even in the late game (Naxx), it's still easy as hell to find a good guild.  Every guild is always looking for active, contributing members.
---
I'll step in and answer that in a non-hostile way:  
---
Splitting the playerbase is bad for Blizzard because then they have 2 separate games with 2 separate audiences that they have to cater to. They would have to spend money on a TBC dev team AND a Classic+ dev team, without adding new subs. It's double the work with no added income for them.
---
Well it was a gnome, and gnomes are evil. So there's that.
---
How are you making 100-200g a day? Unless you are farming endlessly after work or a mage.
---
&gt;Just praise RNGesus to bless your runs
---
No, no, no, that is not the correct way. It's a bit harder on the H side, but you must find a willing sacrificial gnome and watch them expire while praising the Loot Gods.
---
&gt;Outland is far too compartmentalized and it turned the old world into somewhat of a ghost town 
---
This is one of my biggest complaints about TBC. I really enjoy most aspects of WoW. There is a lot to do 1-59. TBC kind of shuts everything pre Outlands off. Classic+ has the potential to incorporate TBC content without doing this.
---
If I recall correctly, it is 60-70% faster (than retail currently) to level from 1-50
---
I'm not saying its not amazing, but it's not needed as much as you think it is.
---
you can hit ony from underneath her
---
Because its not hard to reflect to see what made a game good in the first place if you truly just take time and look at it right.
---
fail
---
I've only seen rank14 geared warriors pvp with fury
---
His analysis is too simple.  The value of crit increases as you add spellpower, you can't just look at the base damage case and make inferences.  Lightning bolt mechanics I believe are very similar to frostbolt so the following formula provides the spellpower to crit equivalency.  Note that hit% does not appear as it modifies the value of both stats equally.
---
   spellpower_to_crit = 0.01 * (base_dmg + coeff * spellpower) / (coeff * (1 + crit%))
---
It's amazing how many people are blind to this.
---
They make shit expansions because those shit expansions sell. They're following a tried and true formula that outputs bland garbage that appeals to the current retail subscribers.  
---
Classic is very obviously not following that formula and appeals to people who do not like the garbage. So they wouldn't be constrained by the need to follow a formula and might actually stick to what the Classic crowd likes.  
---
In anycase, I do get the hesitation given the state of retail, but I don't think devs are hardcoded to only produce 1 type of game.
---
That’s what I thought and that is how it has always worked in the past, for whatever reason it has recently stopped working like that for me. It’s like my pet just decided not to use it even though it is definitely selected for auto cast
---
With jobs, companies are also more likely to layoff or fire people now.. rather than tenure and pensions. Why would you give them loyalty when they give you none now?
---
Personally I agree and I hope that the improvements that TBC brought become a part of Classic+ (if they decide to go in that direction). 
---
However, by making TBC the divergence point you've opened a can of worms that need to be addressed.
---
1. Why TBC? Why not WotLK or Cata, I personally think TBC was great but there is no such consensus in the community other than subjective opinions, doing Classic into Classic+ keeps things simple.
---
2. You now have 3 populations that need to be managed rather than 2, you have Classic, TBC and TBC+ (which is essentially what you're advocating for). How do you manage these populations? do they share realms? Do I need to re level each time? Is there forced migration etc. and this is all in addition to modern WoW.
---
I think you commit to TBC (then WotLK eventually) or you commit to Classic+. Trying to do both creates more problems than it solves.
---
I am currently running this build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/051230130505141-0350510303](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/051230130505141-0350510303). 
---
 I am in mostly blues, not all bis.  My trinkets are trash since I can't get anything to drop and I haven't crafted my truefaith yet.  I don't know my actual +healing off the top of my head.  I do have 1 piece of T1 (gloves) but ive mostly Pugged raids so far as my guild hasn't started yet (starts raiding this week actually).  Did a PUG Ony last night and I was 3rd on healing but not really far behind and I didn't run OOM at all doing R3 Heal with a couple of Flash heals.
---
I switched to this to try and farm some DM:E for gold as well as try for my trinket.. Though as a side note doing about 3 hours total of DM:E (been busy or running dungeons) I have YET to see a book spawn in that room and I kill all the lasher packs.   So either my info on where the spawns are is wrong or I have the single worst luck..
---
Well thats how they get ppl addicted ;)
---
Make them feel like they have to play more and more and more.. and only no livers fully addicted to wow are actually fine with the next phase.
---
That’s how it works mate
---
What's your standard for "hold aggro"?
---
Is it the "I am going to spam Shadow Bolt the millisecond you pull while also dotting up every mob in the group?  Or is it "I am going to wait a couple seconds - let you build some aggro and then jump in and kill in the order specified".  I'd agree on them being geared properly but I also think a lot of DPS treat tanks like shit because they expect that they can blow the place up with no regard for threat mechanics.
---
The PUG players I have seen in groups right now makes that a very obvious question... we kicked a Mage from UBRS the other night because after being repeatedly warned by the tank he was still sheeping a mob in the group before the tank had even finished marking them up.  Tanks that are running with a PUG have no idea what they are going to get and for them it's expensive to get a shitty group.
---
Huh, out of the 70 I have on my friends list, the majority only play classic and are 60. There’s 3 people who play retail on that list.
---
Conceptually these places are all referenced (except ZA, but it's just another one of the many "troll temple" places so very thematically fitting in classic) already in classic. So it's not like they're just grabbing content that belongs in other xpacs and shoving it in classic; it's returning things that weren't finished in time for classic. Kara, Hyjal, and CoT were supposed to be in classic originally. They had done plans for Uld and GB. That's more than a faint idea IMO.
---
All they need to do is make itemization and raid mechanics... Two things that acti-blizz is arguably a whole lot better at now than they were in 2005. Do I trust them to make a good non-symmetric PvP system, or create a cohesive world? Nope, but adding new raids doesn't require them to reinvent those things.
---
And again, there's the "I don't trust blizz" argument, but for me I don't have any interest in moving to TBC or restarting classic fresh. So it's either wait for the servers to stagnate with no new content, or quit. I'm fine with them shooting their shot if it's the only thing that might keep a ton of players like me engaged. At worst, it's a flop; and we get the same results as if they just left classic to fester with no updates.
---
This is the chance to make the best game ever better. 2nd chance.
---
Fury is way worse for PvP than Arms is for PvE.
---
So if you want to do both well, go Arms.
---
Theyre already rescaling all available content down to 1-60 with their new retail expansion. I think if you cant connect the dots on how thats killing two birds with one stone for them, you arent really paying attention.
---
TBC is garbage. Classic+ at least gives me hope. No resilience, no power creep, no flying mounts, no new continents that make Azeroth feel empty.
---
What private servers were handling this many players?
---
I use a scimitar pro which has 12 buttons on the side. In Corsair software I've bound 1-9 to those exact binds. When I press 1 it uses the ability in one. Adding shift to mouse 1 casts shift 1. Using this system, I have 1-9, shift 1-9 and control 1-9 bound. I also use mouse wheel up and down with shift and control modifiers. This is a total of 42 keybinds. The others I use letters on my keyboard for with modifiers.
---
Really liked TBC, they keps class individuality while slowing down the crazyness of 5000 compos per raids. The dungeon were great, heroic mode was amazing with some really nice quest, raid were excellent and there was a ton of them.
---
New race were meeh and the end of paladin / shaman uniqueness wasa bit sad though
---
They could do it with a massive and expensive server overhaul, but they can't do it in time. Classic wasn't expected to be this popular, by the time they found out it was just too late to do huge overhauls like that.
---
The best we can get, being realistic, is a bit of server performance improvement. But the XvX scenario where battles scale insanely out of control is something that you need to dedicate a lot of resources to working through. See EVE's decade long struggle with the topic.
---
I shoved my dick in my nightsaber when I fittest got it
---
You will pull extra stuff at 58.  I ran my warrior through when he was 58 and we had to pull some trash.
---
iirc You want your range check at 23yds instead of 10 because the blast radius is 20yd.
---
I'll be the idiot asking the stupid question for people who will ask it in a few minutes: If private servers can ask SERVER to trust players, so can Classic servers. Why would Blizzard not take this approach since it is clearly superior?
---
Hello! I'm not sure if this will quite fit here, but here we go! My partner and I are going to start leveling characters together. She wants to play a priest, and I am undecided. Right now I'm caught between hunter, shaman, or druid. Speed wont really be our thing as we're focusing a lot on the quest/story lines. If anyone has some tips or considerations to help us/me make a decision, I would appreciate it!
---
Did you look at your own link? It literally does not have classic numbers. Only says it had a great increase.
---
Northdale and nostalrius
---
I set my 1-12 on my mouse to be F1-F12. Keeps all other keys on your keyboard available for other binds.
---
I never had this issue then and I didn’t have this issue from approx level 1-26 but from 26-30 it’s like my pets just decided to stop using Growl 🤷‍♂️
---
You realize people can lie/make jokes on the internet right? That’s why I’m asking if it is a real quote, because I can’t watch a 40 minute video right now to verify
---
you are correct. Basic math here
---
Piqued*
---
^(not to be an ass, just so you know)
---
&gt;Also I love having classes that the other faction didn’t have and if your complaining the game was not fair because of this, get gud.
---
I though this feature really put the hate for the other faction in you. I forgot how much you could hate paladins until I picked up Classic playing Horde again. It really amplifies the Us vs Them feeling.
---
I know, it's a bummer.
---
What people are missing here. As much as blizzard is dropping the ball on this topic, holy fucking ballsacks pservers being able to do that is incredible.
---
That is not something you expect from a russian basement operation. Those coders were actually incredibly good.
---
If a raid lets you PvE speccd into Mortal Strike, you’ll be doing shit damage and taking up a very precious debuff slot
---
Arcane studies have shown that you might fall asleep doing that.
---
Yup,  i guess people apply the same train of thought in a different type of organization
---
If its the only thing selected to autocast is the focus just sitting at 100 and not being spent at all then?
---
I do this too! And then get super stressed if I can't catch up to them
---
Commenting so I can come check in on this dumpster fire later.
---
Also happened for me
---
The idea of Classic+ sounds pretty cool.  I just don't feel confident in the current team to deliver a product that would stay true to the ideals of classic.
---
One of the biggest reasons I want TBC and Lich King is because I feel the class balance is way better, especially for hybrid classes.
---
The trouble with Holy spec in early levels is it doesn't really give you that much of an advantage healing wise. You're better off with a shadow/disc hybrid spec until around 44, at which point it makes more sense to switch to Holy if thats what you want to do. Up until then you can heal pretty much anything with ease.
---
I do love when a fight starts going south though and you pop out of shadowform and prevent a wipe. Like, yeah, you guys like having a shadow priest now don't you.
---
Plus one of my guildie healers always tries to get me in his group when running endgame dungeons because VE makes his job way easier lol.
---
Explain why they changed mob leashing for packs that aggro together.  That's not classic.
---
Explain why Vanish doesn't work correctly.  That's not classic.
---
the explanation was only useless because ypi didn't understand it.
---
on a private server you can tell the server, that you killed the other player with a 500000 frostbolt crit from 2000yds away and the server says "ok, if you say so.."
---
&gt;With hotfixes that we are currently deploying to all WoW Classic realms, we are substantially increasing the number of players that can be simultaneously logged in and playing. We expect this to result in smaller queues for popular realms.
---
Unless that hotfix was simply flipping a switch that magically made their servers more stable, it seems like the layers they added played a role here.
---
I honestly hope you're right but I think it's too good to be true.
---
&gt; From Blizzards perspective, doing TBC is the safe, obvious play (and what they'll probably go with due to it's predictability and the lesser resource requirement for the dev team).
---
I find it surprising how many people dont understand this part. Too many people get pie-in-the-sky ideas of the future while using very little practical logic. TBC is the smallest risk they could take that would still reap rewards; its the easy choice for them.
---
Keep your negativity to yourself.
---
That is true for world pvp, but anyways everyone is complaining of getting gank in the world so whats the problem for tbc haha
---
Releasing dungeons with shitty 1.0 itemization and then having the 1.10 (I think that was the revamp) revisions be for the heroic version would be pretty sweet.
---
Weird that 4 of them have the same gear
---
What's the context? It just seems odd.
---
Only yellow attacks
---
Shhh  don't say anything about deathcoil.
---
Thank you!!
---
In Vanilla you kept the title after hitting, the rank of course fell off.
---
Are there pieces of hit gear you can shed for more raw stats since you have human racials?
---
Multiboxer
---
And also some of your faction’s people passing you by ignoring you as you get ganked to death. PvP servers only works if the faction population is close to 50/50 and there is a strong cohesiveness and camaraderie within each faction.
---
Thats not really what happened though. Blizzard catered to part of their player base and the rest of us left. Classic represents the original spirit of the game and all the players who prefer it. Perhaps, in time, classic will show them the social and challenging aspects of the game will ensure longevity vs appealing to the most fickle and hardcore of players. 
---
If anything we showed them theres a market for this.
---
When did I say "classic numbers"? Don't put words into my mouth.
---
And just a FYI coming from someone that prefers higher pop servers - even medium pop servers have a bigger population than high pop servers did in Vanilla. You don't need to pick the layered option if you're worried about the server dying out eventually.
---
"That's a lot of fuckin' money."
---
&gt;Classic+ offers the potential for greatness and a new path for WoW
---
I completely agree. I would like to point out that Classic+ can take the best of these expansion people like as well. For example, I've heard some really cool ideas for incorporating Northrend and Death Knights in a Classic environment.
---
It's easy imo, people who actually wanted Classic now wants Classic+, and people who wanted Classic to eventually play TBC wants TBC.
---
Ha! I'm on mobile right now! Fool!
---
I've had some good interactions as well, and I really enjoy some of the Challenger AMA's, the real problem is there's almost nothing he can tell me to make me better, because at this point it just comes down to execution. I know the game, and I know the why's and what's, I just don't always know the where's and the when's. My macro has always been a weak spot, but without specific advice tailored towards me, it's really hard to get much help out of Summoner School in my opinion. Obviously, the lower in rank you go, the easier it is to give "broad" advice that's helpful to a lot of players, but anyone at Platinum+ it normally just boils down to execution in my opinion. That combined with thinking/planning ahead, which isn't something you can really teach/explain through text. 
---
I don't know where a lot of the theory crafting takes place, but I use the Fight Club discord for Warriors if I want detailed information. Really good info, including info if you wanted to min/max, and they also do a pretty good job of explaining why and showing how they arrived at that hypothesis/conclusion through their testing. I'm not a huge min/maxer anymore, but I like seeing some of their theory crafting, so that could be a good starting point. I believe (and hope) that other classes have something similar, but I don't know any others, because I really only care about Warrior mechanics.
---
But we are all idiots for staying on our high pop realms, right? Should've changed to a server that was opened 3 hours before launch like all the smarties.
---
Actually couldnt be more wrong. Pretty much every hardcore guild is saying this is too fast
---
Well, it's true in this instance.
---
For me, because it’s been a literal decade since I played that content, and I was a stupid kid at the time. Playing it again while knowing what I’m doing, doing raids, doing advanced content that I skipped before, sounds great.
---
that guy is 100% about to miss
---
It's a 50 to 60 zone, only 7 quests require lvl 57. The bulk of the zone requires lvl 50 to accept the quests, so they were in the right zone. Maybe they just blasted through all the cauldron quests and got to the last one which is the hardest for a lvl 51
---
You’ve spent more time writing this reddit post then looking up what gear your character should use. 
---
Bad hunter is bad.
---
Everyone has the right to roll on items that are better than what they currently have. 
---
Why should I pass on an upgrade just because the rogue (or whatever) in the party benefits more from it? That doesnt make any fucking sense.
---
I mean if you don't like arena fine, there is still bg and duel, + pve in my opinion is way more fun in tbc. More diversity in spec, 10 and 25 man raid. So you can just group with your friend for fun.
---
I would probably do Warrior, Druid or Paladin so you can have a “tank” for questing and dungeons.
---
I’m a Priest leveling parallel with my brother who is a warrior.  It’s nice when we want to do a dungeon, to simply say “LF3M dps”.   It’s also easy to do elevate quests.
---
you'd be amazed at how well this works. When I was a HS kid working retail I remember helping this guy in Home Theater. Guy was a complete twat, treating everyone like shit, if he didn't get what he wanted like a discount or some bs "get me your fucking manager"...then treats them like ass. After he got everything he wanted I asked "do you treat everyone like shit?" His reply was the friendliest interaction throughout the entire transaction. He kind of chuckled and went on to explain.   
---
This is just 1 example. Throughout a career I ran into a whole bunch of similar people. Most if not all were in power positions.
---
Yes, I’m interested in seeing an official Warcraft log if you’re able to get it.  We can see fight length, number of casts, etc.  A meter readout won’t do much, you’ll need to use something more in-depth.   What’s the character name and server?
---
This is my life currently. Trying to get as close to 60 as i can before P2, and i take short cat naps at work.
---
Yeah and idk about most core players, the game grew significantly from bc/wotlk releases
---
&gt; the best way to gear for PvP is through PvE.
---
welcome to vanilla lmao. Not sure what gave you the idea that this wouldn't be the case
---
That’s a nice ass cock
---
Hardcore guilds don’t even use hunters for Nightfall anyways, since warriors are better at it. It’s just an extremely niche thing.
---
Classic is as close as we can get it, nothing will ever be """""""""true vanilla""""""""""" in the definition you seem to be using.
---
Yeah, I just found out that offensive dispel is affected by spell hit so I will also be looking for the star of Mystaria because the worst feeling in the world was failing to dispel blessing of freedom 3 times in a row. (I know I don't have that issue yet because the horde doesn't have paladins, but its burned into my mind)
---
Them existing in the current retail framework doesn't make them inherently bad, either. The retail framework demands the garbage Blizzard puts out, manufactured by statistics and focus groups to keep the maximum number of players engaged regardless of the quality of content. 
---
It's not independent developers who are deciding each zone should be made up of little clusters of 3 quests, dungeons should be simpleton-level, and dailies are the holy grail. That's top-level developers following a formula. Classic breaks that formula and shows that there is a viable market for not-garbage, so devs would be encouraged to follow what makes Classic fun and keep going with that.
---
It's because end game PVE is obtainable by the average player. Everyone can clear the content and get loot. Rank 14 is going to be scarce for most and a lot of people don't have time to put forth the effort.
---
The colors arent even right.
---
Pservers were free and i never saw anything like a damage hack. Blizzard should be able to have decent anti cheat while still allowing world pvp
---
Yes but it buttfucks your mana and is hard to sustain.
---
How is retail riddled with MTX? Theres a pet/mount store that have no effect on the game, and there's basic character services. Then theres like 3 xmog items they added years ago and no one bought.
---
Classic is grindy, retail is hard (if you want it to be)
---
Oh, turns out I'm totally misinformed then. My bad!
---
Such is life, my friend. As a forced casual gamer, whether it's Blizzard or some private servers, there's no place for us. :) I just hit level 41 on my lane, and will keep on trucking until I can no longer find groups. Then it's back to the seedy world of private :(
---
Not saying this to call you out...but do you have a source for that quote?  I'd like to see the whole thing.
---
TIL
---
Has nothing to do with being casual but keep thinking it does.
---
Yeah because it’s not difficult in the slightest.
---
I know people going to medical school with kids that are 60 on two characters and raiding.
---
Stop making excuses for yourself or accept the shitty lifestyle you’ve created for yourself where you can’t be as caught up on your hobbies that you wish you were.
---
Was it for BRD arena runs? Lol, the amount of people I see asking for arena healers is insane, without adding something in for them. Why should I heal that??
---
Cheater!  Incoming ban
---
Two of my favourite things about Classic are lost in BC:
---
1. The nonexistence of flying -- A point on which something around half the community will agree with me and half will disagree
---
2. The entire game world being relevant
---
I do like the balance changes that make more specs relevant and competitive in endgame, and I semi-like/semi-dislike Ally getting Shaman and Horde getting Paladins. Overall though, I think I'd prefer Classic+ over BC.
---
It’s a pretty safe assumption that if/when tbc happens it’ll be different servers. Hopefully with option to move so we can go into it with these chars but they surely won’t just change the entire  classic rule set that everyone signed up for involuntarily
---
Great meme but the mods around here are trash.
---
Removed for "Low Effort" in 3....2......1......
---
We got em boys.
---
Why not rework TBC into Classic+? Remove neutral cities with everything in them, remove flying mounts, move some of the assets to the old world in unused zones, something along those lines could work for a lot of people. It keeps the world intact and the population largely in the same area instead of a mass exodus at 58 to Outland because everything you need is on the other side of that portal.
---
Something doesn't make sense because Blastershot Launcher should have higher min and max damage range regardless of the speed (and it's slower anyway).
---
Perhaps Classic Character stats is including the DHC proc in its stat rollup. In any case, go kill some stuff with a damage meter running and you can quickly verify what's going on. You should see BL hitting harder unless something buggy is going on.
---
I absolutely want classic+. I dont want a structure where all expansion content is pay-gated on its own continent and as soon as the xpac drops, you never see another high level character in Kalimdor or Eastern Kingdoms again. I want all the unfinished content from vanilla added... I want to see Hyjal and the Emerald Dream and Grim Batol and Quel'Thalas fleshed out the way they were originally intended. I want a vibrant, community driven smorgasbord of classic WoW content... every server its own unique, player-driven world... too much to ask for from a company who only cares about its shareholders and quarterly profits, I think.
---
False. A warrior should have the same keybind for Reck/Retal/Shield Wall.
---
Shield Wall often needs to be used FAST because it's an oh shit button, and requires a keybind. The same goes for Reck/Retal.
---
TBC killed the game for me, so that's going to be a no.
---
It's almost like he develops video games for a living...
---
If they do classic plus please give boomkins some love.
---
%Mana back on crit talent that replaces improved throns...
---
So not exactly at launch but still before almost anyone was level 60?
---
Yeah but only a few classes can do these
---
this looks like my cat walking across the keyboard
---
As far as I know all mice work like that. I used my number pad to bind all my mouse buttons. Only thing I’ve run into using this method is some default short cuts are either bound to the number pad or are ctrl + num 1, etc. so you’ll have to unbind those.
---
your chair is way too low
---
Most people only do arena/angerforge. No shit you can't find a healer you twat
---
I think you're wrong about people dropping off. They won't be online as consistently, but a lot of the people who have been waiting for Classic are the type of people who don't game every day. I think the hardcore group will eventually die out once content dries up, but there's so many players who plan on sticking around. Private servers never died out. People who know how to hang around and enjoy the game can find endless enjoyment in rolling alts, grinding rep, collecting vanity items, etc.. there's a crowd that's clearly here to 'beat the game' and clear all of the content, and there's a crowd that's here to play the game and screw around as long as they like, and I think the latter will stick around for a long while. I mean, there's still people actively playing Diablo 2. It's the whole reason we got Classic, many of us never got burned ourselves out on it.
---
Depends on the players and how much they learned from the NA players that were already 60 with guides. I hit 60 in &lt; 3 weeks on Classic
---
Classic+  
---
Every class needs their epic weapon.  
---
So many zones that were never opened when they were already developed.
---
OR they dont wanna produce content for 2 different but also the same but not really MMO's whose story would actively be overwriting eachother?  
---
Seems to make more sense.
---
Yeah
---
What is an "ID number"?
---
or, literally just macro eagle eye so it can be cast consecutively, and hide anywhere you want.
---
i think its a weird left hand mouse freak person so theyre using the numpad with right hand
---
Tanked at 44 and 45 on warrior. With low/bad DPS you can jus kite the last boss to the upstairs room where you killed the four rock Giants, and the adds are alot less of a problem for the group because they slowly have to walk up the stairs so you only fight a few adds during
---
In what way lol? You had major non WoW streamers streaming the beta and bringing countless thousands of eyes to the game. Ive been around for every xpac, and classic has had more hype than ive ever seen.
---
*Your skill in Guns has increased to 121*
---
Yes Blizzard has the data. This confirms nobody but you acted like the lack of any evidence confirms your version.
---
We only have our observations, and we see plenty of low leve players, and a lot of talk circulates about being casual hovering in the 30-50 bracket playing as a hobby besides outside life obligations, and not 8+ daily.
---
We can rush new content, but with shit servers it will just lead to frustration and people not playing because it will be unplayable to everyone.
---
Individuals no-life grinding 2-3 characters to 60 and finishing their gearing in 2 months, then not having patience for Blizz to fix their stuff is more of a personal problem.
---
But that's just my $0.02.
---
Big oof here. You have 2 better trinkets from quests but you needed on their BiS until phase 6? You’re the asshole here this is basically ninjaing loot.
---
It's better than dreadforge for sure, it's effect is godly in dungeons and pvp with the mace spec. Fun AF.
---
PREACH.
---
This is what old school RuneScape does. The only thing is blizzard is not going to shell out for a full blown dev team to make new content at the start. For the first few years OSRS got like 3 devs and little funding. Now they have their own team which is continuing to grow. They need to do TBC first to test the waters, then branch off into classic + once they see people want to continue to play. Blizzard only cares about money so i doubt they are going to go a + route.
---
Has he/she made it to the water?
---
Man I wish we had AoE. I started playing back in Wrath when my spriest had Mind Sear for AoE and SW:Death for being awesome.
---
I miss those spells.
---
Yeah. As a Horde on Stalagg, I fear the frequent griefing of the hardcore guilds like Grizzly.
---
Of course, wow classic is time consuming, who has time to play it with full time job and kids.
---
That's why I played/payed for 1 month, had some fun, and then quit after the month was over.
---
I CANT STOP SLIPPING DOWN THIS SLOPE
---
I think he's just Australian
---
Jeez, this just seems insane. Do people just not have to work?
---
Eh, thats true I guess. I think you'd have to redo the quests to make it more Classic appropriate. I don't think the Classic crowd would want Cata Hyjal or Uldum.
---
[You can't make accusations like that without evidence.  I assume that you have some?](https://youtu.be/Wo8JKkvbXkU)
---
Please do this dungeon more! I need my mindtaps!
---
Sincerely,
---
An oom resto shaman.
---
P.S. STOP TRYING TO UNDERLEVEL THIS DUNGEON. IVE HEALED A LEVEL 58 TANK AND TRIED WITH A 56. STUFF HITS HARD IN HERE!
---
Cata was the end for me. I have no interest in the broken world scenarios and they took the fucking talent trees then, too, if I recall correctly.
---
Heroic still wasn't hard, but mythic dungeons week 1 were a real challenge.
---
Okay but throwing money at problems doesn't solve them.
---
They should go onto classic + and make things like Uldum come to life
---
Not necesarrily since the teleport to karazhan can be pretty useful
---
By modern do we extend that to something coded 15 years ago? Because idk if that really applies.... sure if the game was designed in 2015 or maybe even 2010 but look how many versions of windows Microsoft has been through since 2004. 
---
Blizzard trying to update the engine for WoW is almost a direct parallel to trying to update Windows XP for a computer in 2019. There is a reason once these things are optimized to a certain point they just stop supporting them. After a certain amount of time quite simply the resources (time, labor, cash) required to continually improve a 15 year old system starts to outweigh the benefit of updating it which leads to the system simply needing to be replaced.
---
It's always like that. Reddit has every type of people you can imagine of.
---
HUGE fucking difference in rolling on a HoJ in a pug group and raid loot during a guild raid isnt there?
---
The move to TBC invalidates all Classic progression during the leveling process.  By the time you are in your mid 60s, approaching 70, even the best gear you could have obtained in classic is no longer useful.  The concept of classic+ would allow us to maintain our progression and add to the steady progression.
---
That drop off in 2015 is a thing of beauty. Seeing that sharp of a drop in something that is addictive to many of it's users is fucking incredible.
---
You just have to get used to it.
---
About your comment ?
---
&gt;  it would be fun on a Prot Paladin
---
Keep it it's even more fun in pvp on a paladin. They never expect it. Would use 2 back in the day on my druid FC in WSG.
---
Layering is effectively dead already. Even most populated servers rarely hit two layers now.
---
Nah thank you man. Love learning about how not to make my self look like and ass :) appreciated.
---
I think it's different when leveling since even if you're healing the dungeon, you still need gear to kill mobs with to get you to 60, so its ok to roll on anything that benefits you. But you should not be rolling on BIS caster gear in endgame dungeons, unless you plan on going shadow and announce to the group that you will be rolling on it.
---
Why weapons do you use as fury prot?
---
Flying ruined WoW for me. But Felguard and other class characteristics were awesome. I’m torn.
---
Definitely prefer classic+. 
---
TBC ruined so much in retrospect. 
---
Flying being the my mega of that. Oh god what flying fucked with.
---
 And resilience in pvp....and oh fuck TBC was the start of Arenas....eck.....eeeeeeeeeeeeck
---
I did arena with a decent warrior back when I was only full pre raid BiS. It was really easy provided you remove the poison.
---
He was going to pay me 150g and let me have all the blues, so it was a fair deal considering how early into the game it was. 
---
Went there the other day with friend that is a below average warrior that simply refuses to improve his gameplay despite my best efforts.
---
We died three times until he gave up.
---
Because that's how life works.
---
I respecced for shadowform, then put my first 5 points in wands.
---
The 40s were a breeze to level through. Priest had great sustain and I spent a lot of the 40s grinding mobs and gold instead of running around doing quests.
---
For me there are SIGNIFICANTLY more corpse runs outside of instances than in them. Alliance, Stalagg.
---
Yeah that could be an issue. Maybe he will update it?! Lol
---
That's not... 1%.  Like at all. 
---
Well, maybe in terms of physical floor space it's smaller, but you're not "almost done" once you clear heroic dungeons.
---
I was not aware of that.
---
You have a bow or gun don't you.  :)
---
Haha I know exactly how unhappy you are with yourself.
---
I'm assuming you're a hunter, in which case neither. Get Heartseeking Crossbow or Carapace Spine Crossbow.
---
I don't think this is the case at all. I often run dungeons out of boredom. But there are still other reasons people run dungeons without needing any gear from there. As a healer without gathering professions it's literally the only way to viably farm gold without respecing. I'd assume it's the same for tanks and especially so because they can reserve stuff (eg the first orb in strat) without any protest. Argent dawn rep comes to mind for why so many people are running scholo and strat without needing drops. Dark rune farm is another reason many casters run scholo several times a week. DM:E is just insane gold if you 3-man it, have 1 herbalist, 1 miner and split the loot at the end. One of the group members needing gear from there is just a bonus. BRD especially, but all dungeons, have quests that people go back to finish just for the completionist aspect of the game.
---
There are still specific farm runs, at least on my server, and for those it really seems difficult to find people. For example, healers aren't really interested in Jed/Rend runs any more because all their drops there have a way higher drop chance than the drops dps is after and the grind is really boring, but if somebody's looking for a healer for full UBRS and I have nothing better to do then I'll usually jump on board.
---
GW2 had great expansions with no level cap or stat increase
---
This is the only way classic can grow imo. Why repeat the mistakes of the past when we can follow the successful model of OSRS and expand on our world.
---
There's no expectation for post Phase 6 at the moment. Don't spread misinformation.
---
I wish they did more with Rend
---
It's more like you are asking a tall person on the street to come to the store with you, take several things off shelves, walk around the store with you for a hour. Meanwhile at home they have all the food they could ever want or need.
---
Ha a post just like people that don’t like classic. Got the rose tinted glasses quote but no you think you want bc but you don’t. Honestly I’m disappointed 4/10.
---
Drop rates, and stats in general are largely the most misunderstood thing in gaming communities. People really struggle to understand that something being 1\X chance doesn't mean you should have it by X kills, nor does it mean youre any closure to getting it when you hit X.
---
This largely applies to the OSRS commmunity but Im sure it happens here too.
---
Many weeks back I was running RFK when [Nightstalker Bow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6696/nightstalker-bow) dropped. A huge upgrade compared to my shitty Reinforced Bow. I immediately roled need and I feared our rogue was considering doing the same. After a few moments which looked like an eternity he clicked pass and gz'ed me.
---
Those +3 agi would represent some good upgrade to him of course, but looking at the big picture the  16.18 was more than twice the dps from the white bow I was using.
---
See, it's just good sense I guess. Or maybe kindness. It doesn't matter whereas casual or hardcore, everyone likes being rewarded. After all there's a human being behind that toon, believe it or not.
---
Thanks. I'm not looking to get too crazily involved with making gold, just realize that holding 100% gold is probably not the best option.
---
I'll probably mostly stock up on consumable items that will be used throughout the later tiers. This way I will have them myself as well.
---
Things like Black Lotus are a good example of what I'd be happy holding.
---
That overwatch clone that dropped around the same time as OW was pretty DOA
---
Basically, just tell everyone not to dot. You have 8 slots, 3 or 4 curses your warlocks want to keep up, technically nightfall and annihilator, sunder armor, judgements of mana and/or light if you're alliance.
---
Howbout a 58 mage rolling on Padres Trousers because they have 3 more int than his green pants despite the fact the +healing is completely worthless for him?
---
Learn to print screen or fuck off
---
Sounds prett good to me! Do you adjust certain items in cost depending on powetlevel? For example Staff of Dominance vs Mageblade or Mana Igniting Cord vs T1 Belt. 
---
I don't speak a word of french, unfortunately :D
---
small world seeing a fellow guildie getting trolled in general chat lol
---
I made the exact same thread about a month ago and a few people provided proof from Classic they have it or have seen it drop.
---
I dont get why people think flying in TBC was a bad thing. No one complained about it until like... Cata? TBC was somewhat smartly designed with flying in mind and I really dont think anything was lost with flying. Let's be real, after bgs in vanilla, world pvp was a shell of its former self already, and with the addition of arenas in BC, sure as shit people didn't WPVP anymore. Flying was just a cool reward for getting to 70 and grinding out a bunch of gold.
---
You don’t?
---
Yes but not the head/legs enchants you apply urself. Those still count as buffalo
---
Horde Arms is not shit damage. Its barely lower than fury on single target and thats about it. Trash clearing damage can be significantly higher with SS.
---
Hey buddy I need some advice. Any simple questions I could ask people like you to easily identify them before inviting them to my groups?
---
Classic+
---
I want them to go the Old School Runescape route of things. Keep the game how it is, but add new content
---
I really think it is more to do with server protocols than anything. An official server has to authenticate every command given from client side in order to fulfill legal and quality of product standards. Basically this means WoW operates different from private servers because they have a lot more computations that have to take place behind the scenes on order for this to happen.
---
In my opinion spellbatching at 200ms is actually making the issue worse as well. Instead of resolving computations on a modern server tic rate of 5-100ms they are artificially forcing the server to reserve all computations for a 200ms delay which means more inputs from client side are happening because the window is a lot larger. Basically they are bottlenecking the server hardware by imposing an artificial limitation in software. 
---
Now like I said, in my opinion lowering spellbatching to say 50-100ms might help resolve some issues. Because there would be less computations that needed to happen in this window of time.
---
My dumb ass: "Why is that 'W' so high up? And why dus Classic hurt the Orc?"
---
I wish this is how it works.
---
That's a nice UI, is it prebuilt or did you compile it all yourself?
---
The thought we would, but we didn't.
---
No, you’re bad
---
There is plenty to do, and simultaneously, nothing you're being FORCED to do with threat of falling behind.
---
You can always make more money, because flasks aren't cheap and while MC is easy, the rest of the content isn't going to be so face roll.
---
You can help under geared guildmates get caught up. 
---
You can world pvp.
---
You're bored because you can't understand how to have fun outside of doing anything that doesn't improve your character directly.
---
If its a dungeon like strat live where there is no tank gear, and the gold/hour is very poor when the loot is evenly split, then yeah its very hard to find a tank without some extra compensation.
---
Same with healers on BRD Arena + Angerforge runs. There is very little healer loot for healers on those bosses so you either pay healers, or throw in something they need like Golemlord.
---
Yeah, lemme just put 1 shaman in each group
---
VS
---
1 pally boy to buff every class
---
Dude, you are making us all look bad.  Spend 40g on the DM trinket that has a lot more AP.
---
Where do you people get this shit from? Go log on retail, its still plenty healthy. If anything, BFA did more harm to retail than Classic.
---
You think they’re going to let the game run dry after Naxx while they could easily keep it running for another two years by implementing TBC?
---
But the "end" implies that there's only some short challenge then its over.  You're at endgame for the overwhelming majority in retail, and frankly, most of the time in classic too.
---
We're still not that far from classic release; soon most of us will have a squad of 60s, and then you'll realize that the "end" is really the beginning of anything even approximating sustainable content.
---
Your so lucky :D
---
Ive to the best one.  Let's go with Harambe.
---
Me.
---
I would personally rather see them move on to TBC and Wotlk servers before anything. Aside from that I would like to see them start working on a WoW 2 with a modern engine, graphics and mechanics using the leasons they've learned from those versions of the game.
---
There's a huge difference between 'this is about equally useful for both of us but I'm generous and pass' and 'I'll replace this before ever entering MC while it's the best item in the game for the other guy until Naxx but fuck it, upgrade for me, need'.
---
If you can't see that you're either just trying to nitpick for the sake of arguing, or you seriously lack social skills.
---
If the tank doesn’t establish more threat than your renews heal, no.
---
Mind blasting the trash to proc spirit tap is like it's own little mini-game you get to play in dungeons lol.
---
Oh take your toxicity away from here. Do what makes you happy without shitting on everyone you interact with.
---
&gt; taking hours replying to comments in their threads when they could be leveling instead.
---
Some people have jobs. You may have heard of the concept of earning money in the real world!
---
I find it funny because there's nothing wrong with that group. Sounds laid back but still skilled enough to kill the raids. I'd love to join. Maybe college isn't "useless" but it sure isn't the end all be all my parents and the older generations led it up to be.
---
You just linked the same thing as OP. The sub numbers went up. How does that in any way suggest **nobody** resubbed for classic then moved for retail? Did you not read the context of this conversation?
---
I think if they got it right, more people would be interested. One of the big reasons why so many flocked to Classic wasn't just nostalgia. It's because it's a genre of game that's become so watered down that you don't realize you aren't having fun until you've invested way too much of yourself in to it. Subjective, I know. But, I'd say about half the people I play with on Classic never played Vanilla. They came in with low expectations, and many of them wound up quitting Retail altogether. For them, it's not because they're playing "the same game." It's because they're playing an actual rewarding RPG MMO. But outside of those players, I still have a hard time believing that the hardcore Private Server Vanilla only veterans wouldn't be interested in trying out new content. Sure, some of them enjoy the well-researched, predictable, steady path they take from 1-Naxx. But how many people do you honestly think wouldn't enjoy another 10-man dungeon? A more full 1-59 questing experience? More class quests? More filled out professions? If it's "done right" most of the people who enjoy Classic would play Classic+.
---
Your points are very valid. But I'm never gonna stop advocating for Classic+
---
You deserve to be blacklisted if you rolled need on HoJ over basically anyone else as a hunter.
---
Ah, thank you.  Familiar with the item, not the acronym.
---
Oh shit I never thought about this. I'm def going to troll some lowbies tonight haha
---
I wonder what the total impact of these issues is on the player base as a whole, though. What percentage of players are having their experience worsened by them? For example, even in this thread there are people who said they were in the very fight in question and that it was the most fun they have had in classic yet.
---
These kinds of teams aren't in a position of deciding whether or not to fix bugs or improve performance at all. This is probably roughly how it goes: A ticket is made for these kinds of issues and it goes on the backlog, along with everything else they need to do. Over time they need to prioritize stuff on the backlog to decide what needs to get done first. Importantly, things like major content releases are also on this list. All of these tickets/tasks are given priority or severity in order to decide what to do first. In this kind of setup, bugs and optimizations have a priority equivalent to it's total impact on the users. So if it leads to a bad experience for a small amount of users, it has a low priority and vice versa.
---
So it's hard to judge them unless you know the total impact of the problem, given that all tasks compete for limited engineering resources at all times.
---
So if you apply this environment to this post, it could very well be the case that *right now* the performance issues only impact viewers of popular streamers on Faerlina, which is a relatively negligible share of users. But it's hard to say unless we know the true impact of the problem, which only blizz has visibility of.
---
At the very least I hope you take away that someone not fixing a bug isn't necessarily disrespecting you. It's more complicated than that, and engineering teams especially at scale MUST have a prioritization system in place in order to maximize the success of the product.
---
Because you can get blackhands breadth and Dm Trinket in like two hours time? In classic it’s usually nice to be nice to others. In fact I had a hunter outroll me on Ravager as a warrior when leveling up. He then laughed about it and said he wanted it because it’s cool. So I remembered his name and made a note with my addon. Then a month later at 60 he applied to my guild and I got some sweet justice. You shouldn’t be jerks to people just because they’re strangers. Especially with HoJ. An item war and rogues will use til Naxx in both pve and PvP versus a crappy 20 AP trinket you’ll replace the moment you get blackhands breadth and the dm trinket. Both of which you will get guaranteed as there’s no farming needed for either. Book can be bought dirt cheap and BB is a quest.
---
If you refuse to edit your posts like you claim you are, then yes. You're sticking to your guns. I also posted no pictures... so I guess you couldn't even comprehend my username when you read it.
---
"They just like free shit!" they cried as they paid 25 dollars for the latest reskinned gryphon mount on the shop
---
Yeah got a guildy at 42 kills and hasn't even seen the trinket drop...poor guy.
---
Right. That's correct. Now that person on the street responds to you with "pay me". The answer is obviously going to be "no" because that is an asshole response to an innocuous question. Maybe you wanted to go into the store, into that aisle? There are only so many places to go, and almost everyone is going to those places anyway.
---
I just want Kara. I have such great memories running karazhan.
---
&gt; remove flying mounts 
---
Why do I see this so much? Flying mounts were the best part of pre-cata WoW imo.  
---
Northrend and outland were both freaking AWESOME to explore on a mount. Shit was tight af.
---
Shadowlands?
---
Last time i checked a hunter has 3 melee spells, +autoattacking.
---
A mage has 0 healing spells.
---
So its not really the same now is it?
---
He’s using your logic though. Being selfish is still being selfish.
---
Honestly I enjoy having NS in wpvp more than EM. LB &gt; CL &gt; NS+LB rocks.
---
dual wield would be mirahs song + dal rend off hand, 2h would be fist of omokk or something similar
---
I'm probably not going to keep playing if TBC is the path they take. Even though TBC is a good expansion, I feel like it will just be a stepping stone to further expansions which will destroy the game again.
---
Game is 2.5 months old.  Enjoy the ride.
---
You have 16 slots.
---
If you really want to optimize you should have impervious giant for aoe threat, bonecrusher for single target threat/kitty dps, and unyielding maul or warden staff for mitigation. 
---
Granted it sounds like op was planning on replacing it with unyielding maul but it's not as simple as a straight upgrade.
---
The hit can also be more important depending on your other gear
---
How about on your phone? Works fine honestly. Unless you're specifically looking for something on your work computer.
---
&gt; If you refuse to edit your posts like you claim you are, then yes. You're sticking to your guns.

I don’t think blizzard is good enough not to screw up something like classic+

And whats the question?

How not?

There literal only difference between totem power is one 15% talent that's easily reachable in a resto build.

I haven't paid a tank directly, but while farming strat for my pre-BiS I was more than happy to let the tank (played really well and led/formed the group) have orbs. I'm sure some people would have a problem with it but I was just happy to have a stable group that moved through mobs quickly so I could try to get my Mystaria.

RETAIL BAD

I guess growing up poor as some benefits lol

I live in a choose to live in a house with electricity and I use said electricity on a daily basis; however, I am not an electrician, I just prefer having electricity to the alternative.

I play on a PvP server, not because I’m a professional PvPer, but because I prefer it to the alternative.

As a druid, I think you misunderstand the Emerald Dream, the danger is not in falling asleep, it's in falling asheep.

Lol I didn't provide any info! I asked a question you delusional monster.
---
As far as 5ms go I get into the habit of giving mp5 to anyone with a mana bar. I've had a few hunters ask for something otherwise like salv or king and I always oblige and yield to their personal preference as it doesn't really matter to me.
---
HoJ is a LOWER DROP RATE than bindings
---
Trolling or not the fact that the group stayed together and got a second HoJ on the third kill screams made up story to me.  &gt;.&gt;
---
Wisdom for Hunters and might for their pets; &gt;!unless that Hunter starts pulling the tank off, then it's Salvation for their sinful ass.!&lt;
---
I don't understand why people keep with these "horizontal" expansions. It doesn't work. You can't keep stacking more content at lvl 60 and think everything will now be viable. Either the new stuff will be useless or people will still abandon the old world and on top of that people in outlands gear would just 1 shot everyone because of scaling damage. If you add extra stamina to Outlands gear to compensate then gz you just made sure the made all vanilla items completely obsolete again. Also at some point you'll run into problem of there being too much content so new players can't catch up so you'll have to introduce powerful wellfare gear that people have always whined about.

Blizzard are going to let Classic die as quickly as possible. They're  even rushing the phases so that phase 6 is over by the time their money baby Shadowlands comes out.
---
You play hunter different than I my friend. Even in pvp I wing clip, maybe through in a raptor strike, and get out of melee. Probably no reason to be in melee range in pve.

yea thts fine, nver said to skip phase 2

Yep.  Hand position is terrible.

It kind of is.  But when you've been weapon starved for 20 levels and you don't have gold to buy a green with +Agi, and leatherworking doesn't make weapons, literally double your DPS with a much higher damage values looks really tempting.

Is that with one healer?

Your chair should be higher, elbows at 90°. Also a wrist rest can help. Wrists must be in neutral position while playing to avoid injuries. Cheers.
---
&gt;Did you not read the context of this conversation?
---
Did you not read the report? They are literally saying that Classic was responsibly for the largest increase in WoW history, and that it continued from Q3 into Q4.
---
That doesn't really matter though, since what that guy said is still just completely anecdotal evidence and I provided the numbers you asked for. Anything beyond that is either a new conversation or a new goalpost.
---
ten storms?
---
all tribute loot is 30-40g here
---
It essentially is unless you want to be pedantic and harp about the "benefits" of getting one extra shitty attack every 50 times you wingclip.
---
Classic+ or stagnation are fine for me.
---
Personally, I enjoy the world. Having alts of every classes in every races and doing all the quests, exploring all the little corners and basically just fucking around with people wiping in dungeons and whatnot.
---
I have barely any interest in the end game content as its clearly a fairly minor aspect of the game, which is absolutly massive if you don't play just one main.
---
For me, TBC effectively renders the whole azeroth world obsolete by draining most of its players, which makes the whole

Just use those imo. If you want to push ur raid get rivenspike x2 from lbrs

I sold Guardian Cub for 260k and Hatespark the Tiny (which I bought for 30k) for 450k right before classic to buy some game tokens. Vanity shit sells for crazy amounts in retail. Hell, theres pets for well over 1m gold on the AH regularly.

---
A rare item dropped in a dungeon that melee classes can use pretty much until a couple more updates come out months and months from now. This hunter, a ranged DPS class, rolled 'need' on it along with the warriors, because one stat was slightly better for him in a very rarely used situational role, despite the fact that he can get two items better suited to his class from normal quests. This selfishness naturally upset the warrior. The hunter posts a rant here trying to justify his being a dick.
---
Basically, he ninja looted a rarely-dropped item that other classes on his team could make much better use of because it increased one stat that he might maybe make use of a couple times in certain rare situations.
---
Hunters get a bad rap on loot for a couple reasons. Even though they are primarily a ranged DPS class, they also carry a melee weapon, and have a couple paltry melee attacks. This is because their ranged weapons have a minimum range. If something gets too close, they can fire off one that attacks and one that slows the NPC down, back up and start shooting again. So some hunters see a axe or whatever that has attack power (or whatever) and think "Well, it's a better axe than what I have, so I'll need on it because I melee too..." They do this even when it might be the best axe a warrior in the group can get.
---
Hunters in Classic also use mana. This means that Spirit and Intellect affect their mana. So if they see something like a trinket that has a bonus to INT or whatever, they need on it and it's merely a stat stick for them, regardless if another class can actually make use of it as a primary stat for their class. They might see a sword that has an armor bonus and need on it for just that one stat, when a warrior or paladin cold make full use of the weapon.
---
So hunters can use a lot of items, but like any other class only certain things are actually *useful*. But some see their stats go up by equipping so many things, they take things they shouldn't.
---
I love classic, it's still a bit of a grind but... At least it lets you, like, put talents where you want, and doesn't hold your hand the whole time. Killing ony and rag again for the first time was great. I'm still not a fan of the 40 mans, and I'm low key dreading doing Naxx again. But, the level of information is so much higher than before. If you had told 12 years ago me that my guild that had never raided together before would get rag on its first try, and not only that but beat the submerge timer, I would have told you that you were lying.
---
&gt;All they need to do is make itemization and raid mechanics... Two things that acti-blizz is arguably a whole lot better at now than they were in 2005.
---
For sure, but like I was saying to someone else here, you need to rewind all that to fit in with classic. You can't just jump from Naxx level mechanics to BFA level mechanics, the leap is enormous. So you have to unlearn what you've learned to a point where you're designing TBC level encounters. The two are very different things and forcing yourself to design on that level isn't necessarily an easy thing to juggle when you're used to designing fights with 6000 mechanics. 
---
&gt; At worst, it's a flop; and we get the same results as if they just left classic to fester with no updates.
---
Only true if they host Classic+ on new servers, which I suppose they have to do if they want to avoid starting the begging cycle anew. I would never say never if they went ahead and tried it, I just want an available version of the game as it will be when Naxx is out that I can always come back to and experience as-is. That's the video game I know I love.

I really want Hyjal

---
Yea, it really is, after a few pulls you can get a feel for the group DPS and get the timing just right - enough for the kill, but not too much overkill.  Pretty much the only fun part of dps as spriest :D
---
As someone who still plays new xpacs when they come out, I dont trust or want Blizzard designing content for two games. TBC was my favorite time in WoW. I think its a significantly better game than Vanilla. Id rather they just give us that.
---
&gt; Here is a hint for you. The BiS list saves you time grinding out dungeons that wont give you great loot... That loot saves you time in dungeons and raids. 
---
And BiS has items that take 100s or 1000s of runs.  It doesn't save you time.  It encourages endless grinding for weeks.
---
"core players"
---
Ow fkoff mate
---
"Look at me and the core players, we're te true wow players, everyone else opinion is wrong"
---
Old fucks like u are so tiring. Only a fking minority would truly believe that classic was the pinnacle of wow. This sub is an echo chamber of fossils,flying bad, lfg bad.
---
Yeah, if there was money on it, I'd say it's gonna be TBC. But you're right. We'll see!
---
Can't go wrong with flat damage reduction. So if you're not trolling, you're not far off.
---
okay, rush does not mean skip
---
I did not have the issue of the pointer moving around. Just the sudden speed increases.
---
I want tbc+
---
Me and my buddy leveled Druid /Shaman and it was pretty awesome. We could both heal each other in desperate situations. I could tank in bear or go cat for burst and we both could revive each other if one of us died. Plus we both had travel form from 20-40 so we could move pretty quickly around together. All those things combined made leveling a breeze.
---
Right here.  We've played TBC, so let's go a new route.  One without flying, arenas, space goats, blood elves, alliance shaman, horde paladins, dailies...
---
If they go TBC why stop there?  Why not Wrath?  Maybe in a few years people will look fondly at Cata.
---
He claimed that people were leaving Classic for retail. Blizzard states that Classic gave them a record increase from Q3 into Q4.
---
Bro. The poster you responded to stated that most of his friends came back for classic then moved to retail, and did not doubt that many more people did the same. You said you had numbers that proved OTHERWISE. Your link in no way proves that people did not move from classic to retail. All your link discusses is a percent growth in sub numbers, which are shared between retail and classic.
---
You haven't provided any numbers I asked for. You've done the exact opposite and provided numbers that I specifically DIDN'T ask for.
---
Yeah but things do happen during phase 3, unlucky fear, onyxia Crit etc can kill MT and cause a raid to wipe for no reason. I think planning ahead will help for a smooth run.
---
I had this for ages. Its simple. Untick the max FPS box's. Fixed it for me
---
No viper sting either
---
Charge Whirlwind with a 2h then immediately changing to 1h+Shield beats shouts by a very large margin threat wise and shouldn't bother any healer.
---
If the healer is stuffed and you're also, 2h Cleave/WW even as a deep prot is very good and enjoyable. Everyone can go ham. It's all about your stuff and healer stuff. Gotta adapt. If you don't have a good 2h, DW since you get 5% more damage from one handers in deep prot.
---
On bosses, put a shield for safety and It's ok. For raids, I wouldn't advise on using fury/prot with DW atm except if your healers are awesome and your DPS's aware about avoiding what they can avoid.
---
18 hours of WoW a day doesn't leave time for full time job even if you literally never slept, let alone social interaction. I guess they're not hurting anyone but themselves so whatever, but it still comes off as borderline mental illness
---
See, I agree. If you’re not going Classic+ and for TBC you can’t end TBC then do Classic+ because of the goldmine Wotlk is.
---
You gotta do WOTLK *then* Classic+, of which the. honestly I’d rather just have TBC then WOTLK. Both with changes. Either flying in Azeroth or none in Outland/Northend. Personally I say no flying at all. Flying mounts exist, just as ground mounts. No LFG, no LFR but the 10, and 25 man raids. Things like Mooncloth and Vanilla-end game should still be viable over TBC level gear up until I’d say mid-late lvl 70. I’m sorry buts its stupid that my fucken Sulfuras is outmatched by a fucken random lvl 62 green weapon. Same with TBC to WOTLK. Also bring us Inscription.
---
As this is just essentially Classic/TBC+, give us all the races. Make Classic+ end with us having monks, TBC the demon hunters, WOTLK ofc the DKs. Give us the races and alternative races. Transmog please as well :/
---
Not a fan of city portals, so none of that unless its acc needed like getting to Dalaran or Isle of Quel’danas.
---
Ive never gotten the hang of mind soothe. You would have to cast it on each mob in a pack to be effective right?
---
Best and most accurate answer.
---
Wait. How do you "steal" a devilsaur? Last I checked no-one has the right to a devilsaur.
---
You should get the Ghaz'rilla quest from the Flats, and as you level into ZF kill him for the Carrot on a Stick. If you haven't been to SM Cath theres some good stuff from the two bosses that will last a long time. The neck piece especially.
---
Ooooh, what addon do you use?
---
&gt;In  fact, in the link above, Blizzard even says they don’t want to treat  Classic and Retail as one big subscriber base in terms of their numbers.
---
I know. The fact that you say this makes me think that you thought I held the opposite view, which is wrong.
---
Definitely am trolling. It reduces the hunters damage output by x amount in exchange for doing holy damage per block.
---
It really does in this context. You wanna rush through phase 2 and get to BWL/BGs and savor that for 6 months.
---
That's pretty much skipping.
---
Why not just use a separate tab and stay joined to the channels in there?
---
Swiss guild with around 60 members. 4-5 left for retail. 1-2 left for good. everyone else having a blast clearing mc, ony, doing rend runs and never get the mh =) I love it
---
I noped out of STV and am currently 50.  I didn't aoe grind or dungeon power level either.  You don't have to full clear every zone.  Not by a long shot.
---
I personally like the idea that something (raid drop maybe (probably Naxx)) starts a quest. Upon completing the quest your level 60 "turns," creating a level 1 Death Knight.
---
Sounds fun.  Actually would prefer that role to spamming aoe and nades.
---
Absolutely.
---
Probably a stupid question, but what's an "NF Hunter"? Don't think I ever heard that term being used in my time with the game.
---
1/100 * 1/100 = .0001
---
The odds of one number of 100 being the same as another. Then done again.
---
yeah
---
I was in an UBRS run that was melee heavy last week. Both Dal Rends dropped. Tank rolled need on both, and won both UNCONTESTED.
---
:( [https://imgur.com/a/0TsJnKx](https://imgur.com/a/0TsJnKx)
---
I'd feel more sympathy for Warriors if they weren't loot vacuums who Need everything that isn't cloth.
---
Classic is a disappointment for me from a purely pve perspective imho. I cleared MC/ony the day I got 60 and entered the raid loging phase in about 4 days of play at level 60.
---
TBC raids and dungeons were much better from the start.
---
Sure bud, because you are providing so much substance. Why TBC began the downward spiral has been beaten to death on this subreddit many times over. I provided my opinion, sorry you dont agree with it.
---
This should finally kill the idea that Alphabetical order is the deciding factor on rolls
---
I'd be interested, but at the same time I'm at least equally interested in TBC servers and they're the safer, more obvious choice for Blizz.
---
Fuck dragons.
---
That was the only raid I ever got to.  I think we only got to the chess part too.  I have no interest in raids larger than 10 people.
---
"Mid 30s"
---
How come you healed do much while polyed?  Those were some huge health gains?
---
Tell that to all the huntards that multishot on the pull. *cries in prot warrior*
---
Don't shield before a pull, because all the damage absorbed by the shields counts as threat toward you, and the tank doesn't generate any rage because they didn't take damage.
---
Not good.  Next.
---
Do you spank and tank or do you manipulate pathing?
---
Times change boomer.
---
The world doesn’t revolve around you.
---
Im enjoying the hell out of it.
---
I hit level 60 in brt with a low dd gildmate who face aggro'd a group. During the battle I got the level up, but the healer run oom and so we wiped.
---
Great feeling to hit level 60 and die 30 sec right after.
---
I am a dedicated PVPer and I vehemently disagree with you. The only thing that TBC killed was massive scale WPVP (which honestly is just utter dogshit).
---
Resilience is necessary, and flying mounts allow me to engage in the type of WPVP that I enjoy; smaller scale skirmishes.
---
Must have two people on the same account rotating or something
---
I don't disagree with you. But there will be literally tons of people wanting to farm honor any way they can when p2 comes out.
---
WTB vanish bug fix.
---
I think he meant in relation to retail wow, not every other game in the world
---
&gt;Your link in no way proves that people did not move from classic to retail. All your link discusses is a percent growth in sub numbers, which are shared between retail and classic.
---
They literally said the increase went from Q3 into Q4 and attributed it to classic. How you value anecdotal evidence over that is beyond me.
---
Here is what is going to happen. You're going to go take a beginners course in english, and take a picture of the diploma you receive. Either your next comment is that picture or I'm blocking you, because I'm tired of arguing with people who either can't or won't read.
---
It's not healthy when the game was not designed for that sort of combat and those changes end up impacted the pve aspects.  Arenas were nothing but a cancer trying to turn wow into an e-sport.
---
The quick rule of thumb, if I recall correctly, is that for a 1/X drop rate you have a ~63% chance to receive it by X kills.
---
Generally you want to avoid casting shield on tanks before pulls, as it prevents warriors from generating rage (and thus threat)
---
This is a whole other lvl of retardation, even for this fking sub.
---
id like them to fix it but alas
---
Decent alternatives aren't BiS, don't you know that you could get 5% more dps if you just did this one thing?
---
My point is that focusing on BiS to the exclusion of all other options leads to moments like this, where a casual is getting raked over the coals for a trinket that warriors have plenty of time to farm...
---
that’s....that’s a penis
---
Gotcha, surprised that doesn't violate ToS
---
same as taking screenshoot with a phone
---
I was on voice with everyone in my group. It lagged all of us. I understand this is anecdotal, but its been happening every time we get 50+ people in a single area.
---
Hey guys! Here to take you out of the bubble. The game won’t get any new content or features. It will just have a different release plan than before. 
---
Allright, best of luck to you guys!
---
Yes, but so long as you are running MC the star is super valuable. Fewer resisted or broken banishes makes the raid run much more smoothly.
---
The dark portal fails to open. Boom.
---
TBC is the smallest risk, but it's also the worst option for the long term. If they go the TBC route, Classic will eventually die off. Once they run out of the pre-existing content, what reason is there for people to keep playing long term? Eventually the content will get stale, and the playerbase will slowly but surely quit. Releasing TBC (and then potentially Wrath) splits the playerbase, and guarantees that Classic won't last long term. 
---
With Classic+ yes they are taking a risk, but if they do it right and the risk pays off, they will have a solid playerbase for years to come. Classic+ is 100% the better long term option.
---
Is Inferno worth using from a DPS standpoint? ignoring the 2s stun
---
im all nurtal
---
"I live only to serve, Warchief! My life is empty and meaningless without your guidance."
---
Jesus, the player character can be a bit of a kissass at times, huh?
---
nightfall, its an endgame weapon with recipe in BWL that has a proc to give 15% increased magic dmg taken. in raids of 40+ the hunter will be meleeing spamming "wing clip" on cooldown, because its an instant attack that can be cast on cooldown, it has a high uptime.
---
Well one of your problems is gear, you probably don't have enough stam to outlive the rogue stun rotation, and you don't have the pvp trinket that lets you break the stun. Part 2 is that your holy, and thats the priest tree that doesn't really add much of anything to your survivability.
---
too bad no1 was around to interrupt you, orc
---
BC+ is the way to go. 
---
Classic is great, but TBC was truly an improvement in so many ways. It's definitely a better starting point for a divergent timeline, content-wise and ESPECIALLY story-wise.
---
That's completely fine and fair. Personally, I'd rather play my alt. But since I get a whisper probably every 10 minutes to tank something, I'm going to try to take advantage of it. I'd rather you take a tank that still needs the content.
---
Pvp
---
I knew that was coming
---
If im over 650 healing should I be prioitizing other stats? Im using t1 bracers/gloves/boots and am at 660.
---
You mean assuming the ranged class would pass on the melee item? That's like a mage rolling need on Mindtap Talisman.
---
This has generally been my experience. The horde mentality is more competitive, and with competition inevitably comes conflict. The same could be said about a PvP environment. Personally, I have had the most fun playing alliance on an RP server.
---
My reasons for doing so were not initially driven by this observation, but after re-rolling to a horde pvp server to play with a friend, I’ve encountered quite a bit of hostility from my other players.
---
I think the key, as many have stated before on this reddit, is to find a community of like minded people who enjoy the same aspects of the game you do. The same could probably be applied to any hobby or activity, but it doesn’t hurt to repeat it here.
---
There is no magic to doing this. Unfortunately, it takes time, effort, and likely failure. My personal method is to avoid joining a guild until I’ve met someone with whom I’ve had a positive encounter. Then strike up a conversation, and ask some questions about the guilds environment and focus. If the conversation goes well, great! If not, no pressure, try again with someone else.
---
Just keep doing group content, talk with people in your group, and treat them kindly. You’d be surprised how many great people there are who are just silently enjoying their time in wow alone! It definitely takes initiative and patience. Good luck!
---
It released 15 years ago. Much of that code is older than 15 years.
---
WoD was kind of a mishmash of time travel and alternate universe. Like, we didn't change history at all from Azeroth's perspective, we skewed a different timeline into never letting Warcraft 1 happen.
---
World Boss fight, a dedicated cross-faction group of Mages polymorphing the dps for quick heals.
---
I was tanking LBRS a few weeks ago and had a hunter roll need on the fire resist + damage to enemies who hit you trinket. I had told the whole party I was only there for the fire resist trinket. 
---
The hunter won the roll and then told me he was sorry, he thought it was the gem for the UBRS key. To be fair they have the same icon and he seemed really apologetic but cmon man, the trinket is blue and the gems are green.
---
Ah-hah, that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.
---
star&gt;choker
---
Chess was my favorite hands down. We ended up with it mostly on farm. The damn theater battle sucked depending on which it picked and that damn mage room where I think you couldn't friggin move and then had to run away to the very edges of the room or you got sucked in or some shit. Never was a fan. But overall I just really enjoyed that place.
---
I dont recommend this. Tanks need to get hit to generate rage. No rage no threat.
---
What is "classic+" though?
---
How is it supposed to be different from TBC, WotLK and the following expansions?
---
And if it did happen, would it not face same problems as the original series?
---
The time travel bit of WoD was not the main reason people think it was a bad expansion. 
---
The story was one of the high points, it was the lack of anything to do at endgame (besides raiding) that really made it not great.
---
TWC was daily hell. Don't kid yourself.
---
Finkle’s skinner is about a 10% drop iirc. A lot of skinners would probably pay 100g for it.
---
Can confirm, it was updated this morning
---
I think you mean SWTOR tried to copy WoW.. not SWG
---
So you're saying that it's literally impossible to make fixes to the engine? It CAN'T be done? I'll have to disagree buddy
---
Anyone know how the code is set up to distribute loot to those with identical rolls?
---
I've posted this before but 8 months ago I totally burnt out on retail in the middle of world quest #180,212.  For the first time I felt no pull to return a month later.  6 months go by and my son-in-law says he's having a blast playing classic so I resubbed.  Totally discovered that the WoW I loved had faded away slowly over 14 years.
---
I absolutely LOVE classic.  Will play as long as it's up.  It's nice to have an actual challenge and to have to think about fights.
---
Play retail. Catering to casuals killed retail.
---
Sometimes they leash together, sometimes they reset... there's no consistency
---
There it is, the post where you finally run out of plausible deniability and are faced with the reality that you didn't actually read the context of the conversation. Keep throwing around insults by all means. Go ahead and use more creative language to imply I'm not proficient in English. You're wrong and you're blatantly refusing to admit it or even respond to the evidence presented.

If you were an adult you would have already blocked me and moved on with your life like you said you were going to. Instead, you're relishing the drama like a child. Enjoy your tantrum little buddy.
---
Damn, I only assign over 2 healers for a tank on rag
---
It is suboptimal, but do what you think is fun.
---
I leveled to 60 with the usual 21/0/30 holy build doing a mix of dungeons (like a couple of each dungeon to get most of the loot I want and questS) and questing.
---
This is true, and it’s why they’re doing a level squish next expansion.
---
One expac late if you ask me, but it’s nife They’re finally doing it.
---
Just switch to horde. You'll never have to worry about the wrong paladin buff again.
---
O.O does this mean we could reverse the merger!?   I’d give a nut for that.
---
Learning reading comprehension is also super unpopular it seems in your village.
---
I was running ST on my holy priest last night and the [Glowing Brightwood Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=812/glowing-brightwood-staff) dropped. The group was extremely nice and let me roll need on it so I got it. How long can I realistically use this thing before I'd get laughed at for having it still?
---
Sorry, did I ruin your psychological high from thinking you are on the high ground of having a correct but "unpopular" opinion?
---
Have a great day!
---
And if he only has a carrot on a stick and a stopwatch, I'm not going to be mad on my priest.  It's not optimized for him, sure.  But I'm not going to claim that Second Wind will single handedly beat MC.
---
That's the crux of it all.  Guilds are clearing MC and Onyxia without pre BiS gear.  The 2% you get from the BiS piece doesn't change any of that.  If we were all struggling with progression, sure.  Needing 2% on any character could carry the day.  But we won't be there for a long time and no blue upgrade will ever, ever be in the position of preventing a guild from progressing.
---
Most people playing classic only play for like 3 hours a day or less due to I'll obligations. Its also kill 10 things in 10 different places. It takes an hour minimum if you're a dps maybe. 
---
If youre a healer or you dont have the best flying mount it could take those full 3 hours. It turns the game into a job. I shouldn't need to track quests in Jira with a burn down chart. Its fucking stupid.
---
No vanilla physics for you.
---
In all honesty EVE is there best mmorpg out there.  It requires more social coordination than any other game and the adrenaline is like no other game.  
---
That said, it can get kinda tiresome and is totally dependent on having a good alliance to generate any contentz
---
I lost a roll on Carapace Spine Crossbow to the warrior tank.
---
No class is immune from shitty rolling decisions.
---
This is true. I was quite sad to learn this :( But it makes sense, given that Annihilator is not an impressive weapon for the material requirements to make it, its debuff had to be impressive to justify making it.
---
I would love a Classic+ with more class balances and raid tiers that are on the same level of naxx or higher. Maybe more 20 mans too.
---
I'm sure they'll release TBC and WotLK rather than work on developing fresh content though.
---
Aye, warrior got them to sell.
---
They told us we would get phase 2 at latest 3 months into launch, we'll be getting it 2 months and 2 weeks into launch.
---
There are still plenty of people around those levels, theres a lot of people on each server after all.
---
On Stalagg where I play if you go to the bank and hover over everyone in Org 70% of the people you hover over are level 60. Now of course people not 60 are going to be out questing too, but it is still an astouding representation.
---
The largest scene in WoW has always been PvE players, a LOT of people want BWL and throwing in BGs for good measure means the vast majority of players want P3.
---
&gt;I get that the hardcore players want their next tier, but that doesn't change the fact that rushing through to it is gonna throw a wrench in a lot of other people's gameplay, as well.
---
Hitting P3 throws absolutely no wrench into anyone's play. P2 could be argued to do that but we already knew it would be coming out soon.
---
The best thing to do would be to roll out updates that cause the greatest positive impact, even in the case there are less 60 than levelers the levelers aren't affected by BWL coming out and are positively affected by BGs coming out. There is also the fact that you have to take into account the fact that people at 60 are much more likely to stick around whereas a significant portion of people just leveling aren't going to stick around no matter what changes are made.
---
The last time Census addons worked (like 2-3 weeks after launch) at that point in time before they broke them something like 8% of the population on servers were already hitting level cap, the average level 2 weeks in was already approaching 40s.
---
P3 definitely doesn't need to roll out in the next week or anything but it should definitely be January latest imo, it is a huge positive change for almost every demographic in classic.
---
&gt;damage dealt **from** all sources
---
Smartphones were such a massive fucking mistake.
---
It reduces damage taken from all sources. Does not lower your dps
---
You should love boomers, they're the ones that gave women and minorities rights. What idiots.
---
everyone?
---
&gt;With Classic+ yes they are taking a risk, but if they do it right and the risk pays off, they will have a solid playerbase for years to come. Classic+ is 100% the better long term option.
---
How are they supposed to do this without correcting the glaring issues with classic as it is?
---
I.e. the horrible itemization in raids, broken hybrid specs, ludicrous stat allocation making a lot of endgame and even epic gear inferior to quest greens or greens of x wrath.
---
TBC was the completed version of WoW that classic was. The best option would be to run a TBC+ server because the foundations in TBC were the most complete and offered the widest variety of playstyles.
---
I feel like Duskwood ganking would be even worse.
---
So you're in the top 1% of playing time. Who cares.
---
Since it's their obligation, then even more so to do right by gamers for a change, i'm sure some people are so unthinkably naive that they do not understand or unable to comprehend "reality" in anyway, so i'll nutshell the bottom line so they can "maybe" understand such a simplistic easy concept 
---
Happy gamer's spend money

Unhappy gamer's don't

Probably why wow stock is so low.
---
Would it aide you understanding to add an 'each' to his initial comment?
---
Hearthstone?
---
i hope so too but i think they will go the way of tbc. content is aready there so it would be the best decision in terms of $$/effort
---
Figure our your optimal 16 and have the raid adjust. Some priority ones include
---
Sunder Armor
---
Faerie Fire
---
Annihilater  (May or may not be overkill based on boss armor)
---
Curses
---
Shadow weave debuff (I think this comes with a SW:P debuff slot attached but not sure)
---
Gift of Arthas
---
Demo Shout
---
Nightfall
---
Ignite
---
Sounds like everyone in your friend group except 3 people are lame af
---
There are some part-time jobs I could imagine making it work with. I dunno, I'm stretching a bit here but I imagine something like government subsidized housing and a passive part-time job that allows you to game during work hours (think on-call IT support, working from home).
---
As far as I know, most folks that got rank 14 did so by either account sharing or completely NEET.
---
Honestly if you want to learn exactly how this game works with regard to the warrior class, you should look no farther than the Fight Club discord channel. It’s the best/highest quality WoW Classic content that I have found. It is also an extremely active and reasonably entertaining forum.
---
Anyone know what the odds are of the guy posting that recruitment message replying to this thread? :p (Join my guild)
---
Thanks for this.  The blizzdrones bring up these points against pservers as if the issues were widespread,  but in my 5+ years of playing I rarely ever experienced any of them,  and some of them are complete fabrications.  Maybe blizzard should look in to changing their architecture to more closely resemble that of pservers,  because the gameplay experience on them was far superior to what blizzard is currently offering us, especially on the latter ones such as northdale and lightbringer.
---
Who are you even accusing me of sock puppeting? And what do you think makes it so obvious? I've just been checking back on this thread because I'm morbidly fascinated by how stupid you are.
---
With every hunter seemingly needing items with strength or melee weapons that have procs and zero stats, I assume they all want to be melee fighters.
---
I'll take a look, cheers!
---
0/22/29 (https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-502500210502-05235301005014) is a very common raid healing build that only sacrifices 2% healing and mana tide totem for better melee group support and the ability to do reasonable white-hit damage for solo content and downtime during bosses.
---
Didnt even know they were separate skills - dont use either Sting in raids
---
Holy shit, yes.  People actually talk to each other.  Zones feel alive.  I've actually run into people in the wild and formed spontaneous groups to do difficult quests.  Love it.
---
Private servers did.
---
Well, I myself am not sold on either position, but when we’re talking BiS items—you can sell a BiS BoE for enough to buy a BiS BoE; either way a party member ends up with a BiS item. 
---
But a BoP will not vendor for enough to acquire something of the same value.
---
I understand your perspective but this hasn't been my experience. In my experience, outside of my guild, people definitely are not better or more geared than they were more than a month ago. Most people I run pugs with appear to be fresh 60s, or I even have to run with non-60s for tanks and healers because of lack of availability. Most people in my experience farming for gold are either as you said doing DM:E or strat live orb reserved runs, neither of which I would need. If you do a lot of those runs, you may see a lot of geared people, but in other instances I only very rarely see people with raid gear.
---
I am not thinking it's hotfixed, but definitely have seen the behavior you're talking about. Specifically on low-level content like the gnolls near Hogger.
---
The leashing still works on other mob groupings at higher levels, like Scarlet humanoids in WPL, or Deadwood/Winterfall furbolgs in WS / Felwood.
---
It prioritizes claw, the best workaround ive found is to mash petattack whenever you want it to growl
---
I would expect it to read “Damage taken from all sources”
---
Well yeah. Because  it either happens or it doesn't.
---
For Horde guilds, they usually force this on the one Enhancement Shaman they allow to raid instead of a Hunter.
---
You can’t PvP in the sky. And you bypass all mobs/terrain while gathering resources. Just fucks over the game really.
---
Honestly, if he's an off tank (tanking the adds, rather than the boss himself) than he could just go pure dps fury. None of the adds hit hard enough to justify the prot talents, though if he's tanking the "first to die" add, then he'd miss out on Defiance. Depends on where in the tank order he falls.
---
Great post! We share a similar mind. I just wanted to add ideas I just listed out on another post that flesh out how / why Classic+ could be so appealing.
---
I would be very interested in Uldum, Hyjal, Classic Arena, new WPvP events, Heroic 5 man dungeons and new raids requiring new itemization to complete that doesn't necessarily cause power creep but instead builds out itemization options for hybrid classes or "meme specs" to become more viable and well rounded. EG: after P6 runs it's course, balance the game similar to pre-TBC patch release, add in Arena and go from there.
---
I see so many ideas, story lines and interesting areas that are not fully realized, ended up scrapped or are simply unfinished. Start there. Even if this is a pipe dream and doesn't work out, Blizzard could always fall back on TBC. My issue with TBC is flying mounts and daily quests are the precursor to what retail WoW is today. I loved TBC and I didn't even realize this until playing Classic. I'm not so sure TBC could keep me as engaged, long term, as Classic is right now.
---
I'm 70% through 59 and I feel like I'm fighting for every single inch of this last damned exp bar.
---
Depends on the situation but since CL has no travel time it's nice to go LB NS CL and both will hit about the same time. It's true you might get more consistent damage with EM but if both LB and CL crit naturally and hit at the same time you get some nutty one shots. Geared shamans have a lot of crit so it's not uncommon. NS is just far more versatile which is its main appeal.
---
That's literally me. 31 wife kids, play at odd hours so I can't do dungeons much and just hit 41 lol
---
Hunters don't use serpent sting. 
---
Warriors don't use rend. 
---
Rogues don't use DoT poisons. 
---
Save the debuff slots for your casters.
---
&gt;Once they run out of the pre-existing content, what reason is there for people to keep playing long term? Eventually the content will get stale, and the playerbase will slowly but surely quit. 
---
In another 10 years, they'll just have another Classic re-release.
---
There's a ton of private servers and people kept coming back to them after every new one started up.  People like the journey.
---
Iv'e heard you need to have Nax on farm to get it and to get to that point you need to put in TONS of hours. Plus once you have Nax on farm, there's really no where else to go but down.
---
lol nice internet dueling
---
Holy hell you're as dumb as a box of rocks. I have posted no pictures in my communication with you, which I am now ending, since you cannot differentiate me between whoever the hell DID post pictures.
---
I would like both.
---
But for me, best would be TBC+, Im okay with even WoTLK+. Nothing further tho. WoW ended for me there.
---
Dude, the wanding! I tried priest and I just couldn't go past lvl 15, it's sooo damn boring!
---
Cheap shot target --&gt; Still get auto attacked. HOW
---
You want herbalism 270 for DME
---
Its funny because the Barrens represents 3 races whereas darkshore is for night elves. Loch Modan is the gnome/dwarf area and that has the worst quest progression and fewest quests it seems.
---
Because no flying and no summon stones, you're naturally designed to cross paths questing and traveling to dungeons.
---
I want Classic plus, but it doesn't mean we can borrow content from the original expansions either. Something in the middle would be great.
---

---
Guess it’s gonna be bust then. I have zero reason to believe they’ll take a gamble on classic+ over the sure thing of TBC. I also have zero faith they have ability to get classic+ correct even if they did it.
---
As a Pally I've had hunters ask for might instead...
---
It would be interesting, Blizzard has already established multiple timelines in canon so they could easily start us in the same place and take us in a new direction.
---
I think there will be or won't be classic+. Retail will get level squish to 60, so i don't think they'll go to "old paths" with TBC and 70s lvl. 
---
They will leave classic with last phase for people who love classic exp and focus on retail, but TBC after blizzcon and their plans for WoW won't happen.
---
But, we will see.
---
People need to understand that Shat, the existence of a new capital city with full services, did more to break the community than much else. 
---
suddenly it became a game of who was there and who was not and you never needed you old cities anymore because shat was a full service city
---
Now he's convinced himself that you and I are the same people.
---
What's wrong with the servers exactly? I've logged nearly 240 hours and I've never had a single issue.
---
I personally think Classic+ is the only way that Classic will be able to survive long term. If they released TBC, I'd play it because it was my favorite WoW experience, but what happens when I've already experienced all of the content I want to experience? I WILL NOT want to move onto Wrath. If they release TBC, they are going to have to keep Vanilla servers open to appease that crowd, which splits the playerbase. I'm sure many guilds will have a lot of people who want to stay on the vanilla servers. If they release Wrath, that further splits an already split (and probably much smaller by that point) playerbase. 
---
Adding new content to Classic (including possibly incorporating TBC content into classic) is really the only way a healthy amount of people will be playing this 3-5 years down the line. Yeah adding TBC servers is low risk for them with a guaranteed short term gain, but it won't last forever. People WILL get bored and quit eventually until there aren't enough people left to justify keeping the servers open.
---
One huge argument I've seen made by people against Classic+ is "Do you really trust Blizzard to not fuck it up and ruin it with new content?". My response to that is look at Old School Runescape. JAGEX of all companies was able to get it right with OSRS. They've added A TON of new content, while at the same time keeping the core mechanics and draw of the game intact. If Jagex was able to go this route and succeed, I don't see why Blizzard can't.
---
If they don't add new content to Classic, it is guaranteed to slowly but surely die. People aren't going to keep playing a game when they've already done all the content. I mean SOME people will, but eventually it's going to get to a point where there aren't enough people to justify keeping the servers open. If someone has already cleared Naxx and/or Sunwell, either don't enjoy or are sick of PVP, and there is no new content on the horizon, what incentive do they have to keep playing? I mean SOME people will, but eventually it's going to get to a point where there aren't enough people to justify keeping the servers open. 
---
Classic+ IMO is the only way this game will still be alive (and healthy) 3-5 years down the line.
---
A quick response to those complaining about time travel. It doesn't have to be time travel, that was just an example. 
---
Maybe when Sylvanas shattered the veil between Azeroth and the Shadowlands there were ripple affects that were felt throughout time and space which something something something smashed the Dark portal and we never went to Outlands and queue Classic+ intro.
---
I don't really care how they do it story wise, but I would like to see them incorporate the alternate Classic+ timeline as a spin off to the main story.
---
That is all.
---
k man
---
I believe spamming dungeons is the way. Preferably as mm so you are not a burden to the group.
---
I’m afraid to ask, but why is this a bad thing, I’m not following.
---
Hey man I'm a veeeeeery helpfully guy. I reeeeeaally like helping out. If I see a hunter, especially from my own faction, even better if he's from a guild I don't like, I'm gonna bury the hatchet and lend them a helping hand. Everyone can use a helping hand every now and then, especially when the quest mob is on a 3 hour respawn. Wouldn't want them to fuck up their quest and have to wait 3 hours you know? That's why I help out.
---
&gt; evidenced by a single new IP (Overwatch) added in the last 25 years.
---
that's not a very fair point to bring up. they spent *years* working on project titan - rumors started in 2007 and it wasn't cancelled until 2014, and resources were then put towards making Overwatch.
---
Depends on the length of the fight, if you can chug consumables and not OOM the MP5 is pointless. 
---
For longer fights MP5 makes sense as a Hunter *will* OOM.
---
At least this is true Horde-side.
---
Thrall needs the bag as a condom.  
---
Child supports rough even on warchiefs and that’s about the only sack big enough to work.
---
People will leave anyway.  Not releasing TBC or Classic+ won't force people to keep playing Classic.  They will still be able to leave for other games, and when they've finished Classic, they will.
---
Well there are reasons why retail showers you with epic.
---
THANK YOU. 
---
I was looking for this, go fuck yourself tinfoil derps!
---
Daily Quests.
---
Flying mounts.
---
Advent of "LoreLOL".
---
Obsolescence of the character-filled old world content.
---
Yes, they fixed a lot of the obvious class design issues.  They also introduced a ton of stuff that made the game actively less immersive and less fun.
---
Single target is pretty good, youll do a lot less total damage than a marks hunter though.   Idk why you wouldn't just go 20/31
---
Ok zoomer.
---
Ah ok I'm assuming resto would want 31.
---
The guilds I've been in have 30/21 for that role.
---
If only buffing hunters with wisdom would allow them to realize every melee weapon is not, in fact, a hunter weapon.
---
If the drop chance is .5% you can easily use a binomial distribution calculator to see how many people would've seen it once out of whatever your kill count is.
---
people always say this shit.
---
motherfucker if you never pop the 30 m CD why even have it lol
---
breh... i don't understand how some people make it to 60 and are still so clueless about so many things

We don't get the full context in the modqueue, just another reported post in a list of hundreds. Out of context it's a remove. Really not a big deal either way, don't take it personally.

---
&gt; Not stacking more lvl60 content. Adding world content.
---
He literally said to rework TBC and keep it at level 60 and pushing new content and keeping it at 60 is the general idea I have read about everyone touting about classic+. If you look at the amount of zones, dungeons and raids in current retail and imagine it all at lvl 60 it just breaks. It's not a viable way of making content.
---
&gt;A gigantic world filled with exotic gear and factions and whatnot. Ideally something so big you wouldnt be able to catch up on all the content.
---
So a giant dead world with an endless pointless grind? Yeah the game would have died long ago.
---
Oh no shit? I didnt know that. Nice.
---
TBC has improved talent trees, two new races (space goats and anime elves), iconic raid with important lore characters, arena PvP and a host of other things some people love. Personally, I'm in favor of Classic+, but there's only a very tiny percentage chance of that happening. Given the dev team's recent inability to understand what its playerbase actually values in terms of content, I'm also a bit worried they'll take the worst portions of the Classic experience and run with it in Classic+. TBC was an excellent expansion and a proven product. If legacy servers are something that is in their long-term plans, I can't see how Wrath isn't in the picture. I have retail friends that view Wrath as the pinnacle of WoW and did not come back for Classic. Those people would absolutely come back for Wrath. Just my 2 cents.
---
So are you going to remove their original comment attacking me????
---
I'm not opposed to this if done right.
---
I'm not one to defend blizzard,  but publishing an exact timeline for phase releases well in advance would not be a good thing.
---
They could have released all of phase 2 at that time which would have pissed people off more.   There really isn't any obligation to rigidly follow their content release plan as they stated it was tentative.
---
The phase release plan they presented was an idea of what releases would look like not an absolute.   In classic those things didn't all line up that way, many were done independently.
---
I would expect it to continue that way.  Likely WSG and Alterac will be before BWL.   ZG and AB before  Emerald Dragons.
---
I think all of these will be ahead of the raid releases.  As they should be.
---
Missing one slot for the deep ice debuff from mages which later will change to ignite when mages change to fire
---
I love Classic to death,
---
 and I never thought it would fail however I think the narrative that died quickly was that "classic would be too hard."
---
I remember seeing loads of posts like, "some of you won't even be able to get into Onyxia or clear Molten core it's that tough..."
---
I went in as a trial for a guild (I'm a tank, but they had me dps as arms LMAO) in MC with a decent geared guild, and we cleared MC without a wipe in an hour and a half and I never raided in vanilla.
---
I get that MC isn't really that hard, but man. That narrative died within the second week of classic being launched.
---
But it is easily possible. You can cheat the exact same amount with both systems. One detects it immediately but bans you months later, the other logs the entry, later detects it was cheating and then bans.
---
Okay? How does that make you any less sensitive? No one would have given a shit 15 years ago.
---
The client/server model exists for a reason, and no -- it's not going away, and it's not "fixable."
---
You either trust people's computers to report the correct information, or you run everything on a trusted server.
---
And if you trust people's computers not to lie, then you're opening yourself up to a huge world of hacks/exploits.
---
It comes out as "[name] makes some strange gestures". Partly to stop communication via emotes circumventing the chat restriction.
---
i do this shit all the time on pvp server, even at peak times, did it for myself and for guildies.  mark this one as resolved.
---
I started playing Vanilla a month before TBC so I never truly got the vanilla experience. My favorite expansion was TBC because it felt like what limitations classes had were addressed a little. Paladin for example felt better to play to me in TBC.
---
I quit a few months after WoTLK came out and came back briefly for MoP where I got to level 60 and just felt like the game wasn't the same it was boring leveling up, it was just foreign to what I thought WoW was when I last played. Which was a challenging grindy game that if you could find a good group then you can level very quickly but solo was painful thus encouraging you to make friends. WoW - MoP when I came back I was like this feels like pay to win without paying. Leveling was super fast and I couldn't figure out the point in questing meaning a huge part of the stories were being lost. I literally gave up from being bored out of my mind at level 60, not because content was challenging but because I made it to vanilla raid level without even noticing what was happening in the virtual world.
---
Talk about feeling detached.
---
I honestly think TBC just fixed some issues I had with Vanilla but it was basically vanilla + 10 levels.
---
You and that person are a product of this shit generation- old vanilla players near always helped because they brought their personal morals into the game, morals which you kind sadly lack.
---
Cause I came to play video games not debate neckbeards on politics.
---
Guess the Alliance left a realm overpopulated with Horde and now they have a realm overpopulated with Alliance?
---
Ah okay, this was the response i was looking for. Thanks!

&lt;3
---
I have some news for you. At your current state you are leagues ahead of most people... But leagues behind the no lifers / streamers. 
---
 Not sure where your perspective sits
---
Check out the gear simulator on the warlock discord. For the most part T1 is strictly a pvp set
---
And most people back then really liked the idea and thought it was AWESOME to get a horde-centric story and to see what Draenor was like. And most people LOVED WoD for the first couple months. 
---
WoD wasn't bad because of the story. It was bad because the content drought and garrisons. Time travel isn't what made WoW worse, not in the slightest.
---
Better to just wait until they need a heal to
---
Let them establish aggro and build threat. However I always follow up a big heal on the tank with an immediate renew because you then you can go longer between big heals and get more mana ticks while you are wanding and waiting
---
Even if they do, there's plenty of time to work towards that now. I'm sure there are plenty of people who aren't even 60 yet who will end up clearing naxx before whatever happens after phase 6 arrives.
---
I play a good amount but by no means am I no lifeing the game. I have a full time job, hobbies, and spend a couple evenings a week spending time with friends. 
---
You being inefficient isnt really on anyone but you,  if that's how you like to play more power too you.
---
Didn't know leveling fishing was so hard congrats on the lvl!
---
This is what my guild is like! Just a few of us 60s and were looking to help build our core raiding team. We’re alliance, on Bloodsail, and we’d love to have you run some dungeons with us if youre also alliance nd on Bloodsail.
---
With the quarterly reports coming out I think classic will get some more attention from their hiring and resource allocation staff. The experiment worked, now time to run with it. 
---
They do need to start working on bugs, look at the OSRS dev cycle, there is hold over bugs, bugs with implementing new systems and models, etc.  I would like to see more time between phases, but they might just want to get honor and world bosses out so that PvP matters to people and some extra loot is entering the raid rotation. It makes sense to get PvP kind of "squared away" as quickly as possible to me, PvP right now is hobbled compared to the amount of content we have for PvE.
---
Activision Blizzard stock price is up quite a bit year over year, and QE is always outpacing projections. I'm not sure where you got it in your head that their stock price is low.
---
Sadly, Retribution is simply the lowest dps spec in the game, and is beneath even tanks dps. The highest recorded dps that a ret paladin did was 532 (I think) and this was only achieved by having rolling innervates and power infusions (100% uptime on both) on the ret paladin, and he was in near full MC BiS while doing it. And even then, 532 is half of the dps of the top performing warriors and rogues, and is far above what most ret paladins will achieve (which is more likely in the 200s).
---
Ret also does not bring any unique buffs or debuffs of value (Sanctity aura doesn't count, since nobody uses holy damage except a ret paladin). 
---
So yes, Retribution will simply be carried or not. They will never contribute more than even a pre-bis tank will contribute. I sympathize, we may not like it, but that was the truth of ret in vanilla.
---
doubtful. only thing those children probably learned is ligma.
---
It dropped in my group and the mage thought illusionary rod was better and the rogue realized it wasn't very good for him... I was lucky, lol
---
Are you using blessing of Salvation on DPS?
---
Why can’t it be tbc++?  
---
Wrath is where everything went fucking sideways hard.
---
I believe it's called Spy.
---
I'm with Kantalop - GBS is amazing, except for the part where spellpower is much more valuable than raw stats. Replace it with hammer of grace, but keep it in your bank because the nature resist would be desirable come AQ release.
---
Nice strawman. I said TBCs dailies weren't that bad compared to mists. But I guess reading comprehension wasn't your forte in school?  TBC was good for a lot of reasons, and I personally didn't find the dailies to be that bad. But people like to cry and whine that dailies existed so that must mean the entire expansion was just bad.
---
Do you really believe that?
---
This is what my guild is like! Just a few of us 60s and were looking to help build our core raiding team.

Ohja.

I would suggest good old 32/19/0. If you want to raid and also PvP.  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500222133525101-2050510303](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500222133525101-2050510303) 
---
If you want to raid and not be a shadow priest most healers go for 21/30/0 which is the best raw healing throughput build. I myself prefer 32/19/0 for higher suitability while still being able to heal.
---
Yes you are the asshole
---
Being in the middle always sucks.
---
For the record, the survey results from this reddit have 66% being at 60.  Though probably wow classic redditors  are ahead of most players...
---
Tier 2 helm.
---
Iirc in 1.0 undead could speak common. It probably lead to issues including race pop balance. Why wouldnt u want to talk to the allies?
---
thanks!
---
i don’t pp everything because i don’t like dying getting resisted. debating on going subtlety spec when i do these so i can pp while i wait for lockouts. usually i end up around 15min to spare per hour.
---
Why and how is it more toxic? I play on EU, never played on US. I have found some toxicity in wow but not too much. There were a lot of toxicity in mobas however.
---
I was thinking its function was for AoE tanking, by converting blocks to holy damage. But you’re right, looking at the aura it does reduce damage.
---
&gt; I'll be the idiot asking the stupid question for people who will ask it in a few minutes: If private servers can ask SERVER to trust players, so can Classic servers. Why would Blizzard not take this approach since it is clearly superior?
---
Because it's not superior at all.
---
That's how you get rampant hacks/exploits.  There's a reason why the client/server architecture exists the way it does.
---
Which addon did you use to make the grid?
---
Might only buffs melee attack power, does nothing for range.
---
as someone who is a maxed ironman in osrs, i think this is their biggest attraction to continue into classic+. after all these years they have left dungeon entrances on the map that still have not been used even in retail. We deserve to finally deal with the stone elemental in Tanaris which was suppose to be uldaman.
---
How do you like it?
---
oh the good old days.
---
Is this used for something?
---
Sounds good. I have very limited knowledge of feral druid gear and your OP made it seem like you were farming for an item that was just inferior to another item you could get by next week for a lot less effort.
---
But it gets pretty dull on the barrens with the constant walking so a conversation is always nice for me.
---
Clearly you didn't read the post. Tell you what, we'll do it private server way except the server will never trust your client. You'll love it, trust me.
---
Not really, it's easily automated as long as you log everything then run separately decide whether it was cheating. 
---
You have server checking out combat and talking to players and trusting them, with "server bodyguard" secretly writing down their statements and "server executioner" deciding whether said statements were truthful based on available information like distance, stats, buffs and their own formulas.
---
No. It's the smallest short term risk they can take. But it's sacrificing long term health for short term profit. What happens in 2-3 years when they go that route and you get to the content that people don't like. You have the same exact problem you have with retail only bigger. You're going to keep losing people until you kill 2 games instead of 1.
---
Have you considered how batching affects elemental mastery now? If you queue a shock on to the end of the channeled spell they both are guaranteed crit
---
Pally Warlock has my vote.
---
I use Elvui which lets you completely customize all that stuff.
---
Rechurning out old failed ideas and products is a great way to end up back down in sales with the company wondering if they should start selling off parts of itself.
---
Or, you know, you can actually put time and effort into making a good product based on the foundation of consumer interest the reboot gave you and actually succeed. 
---
You got to pay to play.  Nobody rides for free.
---
because we're reactionists?
---
Paladins can't hold single target threat in dungeons against competent geared dps.
---
They'd have to hold back dps even with salv.
---
For aoe you shouldn't have issues. Your goal is to just stun runners.
---
Agree with OP. Alliance aren’t welcome but come join the horde! Many alliance to kill and man are they bad.
---
dont mind the completely different colored/spelled names and the giant flair icons next to mine I guess right lol
---
wotlk&gt;tbc&gt;vanilla for me.. 
---
While vanilla is cool, the pvp in tbc/wotlk was way more enjoyable for me.. more skills.. a bit of everything.. destro lock / ret pala / mutilate rogue.. some of my favs which are quite boring in vanilla.
---
That's part of the idea of Classic+. New content + fix balance and itemization issues. Make specs like Enhance/Ele shaman, Boomkin Druid, Ret/Prot Pally, etc viable and introduce items for these specs. 
---
I agree that TBC was probably the best in terms of class/spec balance and uniqueness, but they could definitely incorporate TBC class design into Classic.
---
The problem with releasing TBC is that  
---
A. You will be splitting the playerbase between the Classic servers and TBC servers. There will be a massive outcry if people can't remain on the Classic servers.  
---
B. They will pretty much HAVE to release Wrath servers, because there will be a large portion of the playerbase clamoring for that expansion too, which EVEN FURTHER splits the playerbase. 
---
3. There's absolutely no way they will be able to do TBC+ (possibly splitting the playerbase any more) without also doing Classic+ as well (and potentially Wrath+). They can't logistically develop new content for 3-4 different versions of the game at the same time (including retail).
---
I'd love a TBC+ too personally because TBC was my favorite era of the game, but there is absolutely no way that would be feasible.
---
can someone paste the pertinent information here? I can't read official forums, i have an allergy.
---
&gt; Mara is relaxing as long as you ignore rotgrip.
---
Yeah I've learned this.  Sometimes you can kite him by himself all the way up to princess, sometimes he pulls a random hydra that exists only to fuck up your day.  Easier to just forget he exists and take the herbs/tinker
---
Maybe, but we know for a fact that TBC kills the old world for sure so why not try something different in an effort to preserve the community. At the very least the hub cities would stay the same so the population would still be there.
---
Well you have to concider that when classic+ would hit, Most people would already be rundning around in naxx gear, so adding more pre-naxx content doesn't really make sense
---
I'm sorry that you don't get to play as much as you want.   You know crying online and calling everyone a basement dweller won't change that though right?
---
You'll still not be able to play as much as you want.  Have fun in phase 2.
---
I've been using a 12 button mouse for years now.. couldn't imagine mmorpg gaming without one.
---
In wow I use 1-12 for most common abilities inc- spammables, interrupts etc. 
---
Shift 1-12 for special curses, buffs, things used less often.
---
Flick mpuse wheel right for racial ability.
---
I only use keyboard binds for things such as food, bandages, pots, mount and movement speed things
---
Yeah probability of cast 1 and 1000 independant fron each other are the same and its super low but youre 1000x more likely to catch it after 1000 total tries than 1 total try
---
Thrall explains to your horde character that while yes horde and alliance will have small battles from time to time, overall there is peace between the two. Peace that they have not had for a very long time and since Ony is destabilizing the alliance chain of command and causing them to act irrational throwing the horde and the alliance closer and closer to all out war, it is within the horde’s best interest to slay the beast and try to help bring stability back to the alliance
---
yep
---
Many on this sub: "New Blizzard stuff is trash!"
---
Same people: "Blizzard, make Classic+!"
---
Nobodies giving them a third chance.
---
I dont think this about guild progression my friend. People are clearing MC in greens but that doesnt mean people dont want items that are best for them lol. It's an item that he doesnt need and will barely use. Its BiS for warriors until like phase 6. If you're gonna tell me he's not an asshole for needing on HoJ over melee classes then I guess you're just like him and theres nothing left to be said.
---
And its just TF2 updated...with less hats.
---
BAHA, they get salvation or nothing and they better be happy with it or i will not give their pet might!
---
That seems nice
---
&gt;	Classic+ can be it's own WoW franchise!
---
This sounds like a nice pitch in the meeting where this was discussed. Something that - with a lot of work - has a high chance to be a success.
---
Do you want to know a better pitch? “Let’s print money”. Why the hell would they do a lot of work and introduce a risk to something?
---
The work they did for classic translates to TBC. It is likely at a similar stage already as classic was 3-6 months before release.
---
How can you people not see this? Also classic+ already has a name and it is coming. It’s called WoW 2.0. It is coming. And the time for it is not now.
---
Now is the time to print money while making us happy. It’s like companies selling their games for the fourth time on the 3rd platform. Even a decade later. Sometimes at full price.
---
Your whole classic+ dreams are not going away. But you are being super delusional if you think that is even possible in this time frame. They could barely remaster 1.12 and you want them to do 3 times more.
---
Verified working. Agoge of Blaumeux.
---
I expect people will progress through the raids faster than they did in vanilla and naxx won't be seen as such a difficult instance. Particularly because people who hadn't experienced vanilla naxx got to practice the boss mechanics in TBC or WotLK. Even if the tuning was nerfed then, it will still mean that people get through classic naxx more quickly. There is some hope.
---
TBC is the route they choose for putting the least resources in, but for me personally, the day they announce TBC re release is the day I cancel my subscription. 
---
The way wow has gone, aka retail wow, is a dead end for me and millions of others. It's not fun and it's actually sad to see how it went and how it could have gone. I didn't re sub for classic just to repeat the exact same slow death of the best MMO ever created. 
---
Blizzard must know this. If they decide to just re release the expansions and obviously milk the nostalgia for every penny, it would be legitimately sad, somewhat insulting, and they should just turn in their game making license now. 
---
They get a chance to re do it all in a way that grows and creates an interesting, new, sustainable world instead of one that sees subs drop off year after year. I hope they don't fuck it up.
---
I wish i picked a pvp server instead of a pve one... Got my main (Shaman) almost to 60 so I don't want to abandon him. Still sad i can't do world pvp
---
Since you don't understand the point he's making I'll try to make it clearer.  
---
People do not want to lose gear they've acquired over months if not years in the first week of a new update. If that gear was necessary to acquire newer better gear or older gear can be brought up to newer levels then that would be one thing, but that's not how it works in WoW. 
---
I'm putting my time into playing WoW, I do not want to start over with each new expansion again. That drove me away from the game the first time among other things. 
---
There are better ways to have catch up mechanics while making the time you invest into the game raiding, farming, pvping, and so on worthwhile long term. In an MMO it should always be about the long term.   
---
There is no one out there when talking about BC is like "Can't wait to throw away all my Naxx gear and get my dopamine flowing for some bigger numbers that don't mean anything since the new content is scaled around those numbers instead of the olds ones!", instead they're excited about the other things the expansion brought. Those things can be implemented into a Classic+ system.
---
Prett straight forward:
---
1. Only slam if you have plenty of rage to use BT and WW on CD. Basically it replaces HS
---
2. Only slam right after your auto attack. Get a swing timer!
---
3. You can use hamstring to proc Flurry, but after you get some gear it shouldn’t be an issue.
---
4. You’re really dependent on gear and buffs! Max your consumables and raid buffs.
---
A lot of what everyone says is the opposite of my experience. About 1/5 of my original friend group is still playing classic. A few are on retail. 
---
Of the 2 of that stayed we are 60, raiding and VERY slowly leveling alts because leveling is not fun. I just want to be done with it so I can start gearing my alt and playing with my friends.
---
I play with my mouse buttons mapped to 1-0, then the last two are autorun toggle and tab.  With ctrl-# and shift-# mapped to hotbar 2&amp;3, I've got almost everything on my mouse - the only thing I use the keyboard for is movement and those Ctrl/shift keys.  
---
It's kind of a weird setup but it's how I've done things forever and I quite like it.  When I'm walking around questing I can do it all with the mouse and don't even really touch the keyboard until I get in a fight.
---
Agree with OP. Majority of the Alliance fled Horde dominated servers when the original two free transfers opened, bringing over toxic alliance
---
You have a decent wand? I haven't found it to be that bad. Some of the holy talents boost holy fire and smite as well. So I usually just do Holy Fire, Smite, SW:P, wand. It takes a little longer than most classes, but it's not that bad and I can usually go quite a few mobs before I have to drink.
---
I feel that so much
---
Moment they go TBC is where it is no longer vanilla.
---
Its just first step into new cycle of old expansions. Because where does it end ?
---
Why not go Wotkl and.. Yeh.
---
Vanilla is vanilla.
---
I craved that vanilla plus patches.
---
No more, no less.
---
Warriors in my guild just bunch together in a deathball of 4 melee + 1 shaman and blast through livestrat and round robin the orbs. In average, the whole group gets one every 2nd run + gold + D/E every single drops and split the mats. Makes very decent gold, you get to chill with guildies/friends so it's not as mind-numbing as other gold farming strat. On my server, orbs go for almost 50g.
---
As 20/31 I solo farm tyrs hand just fine. If you get a few crits in a row you'll have to FD for sure, but the pet holds aggro well enough.  You'll be pulling from your pet if it's full BM anyways once you get a good enough weapon.  
---
Any other farming is typically way better as marks since you're not relying on your pet to tank much anyways.
---
do you want an upgrade or do you need it?
---
Maybe I'm not following you, why wouldn't a warlock roll need on Drakestone of the Eagle? Mages are pretty neutral going staff or 1hand/offhand, but for locks having the 1h/oh setup is hugely important in pvp so they can keep a spellstone around. Not saying it's lock prio, but it certianly seems like a reasonable roll to me.
---
Or those with grand theories that this shows Blizzard is scrambling to keep players in Classic and proves they have no idea what they are doing. It hurt to read some of the theories people had.
---
The original announcement said phase 2 was "The week of the 12th."
---
So of course people took this to mean it was exactly on the 12th.
---
Is this on Faerlina?
---
There's a huge difference. If you treat it like a chore there's a huge difference between. "Hey, put the dishes away" and "You've got an hour to put the dishes away". 
---
One allows for you to still complete the same rep goal by killing monsters or doing a repeatable quest when you feel like it, and the other forces you to adhere your schedule to have to spread you play time across EVERY DAMN DAY. 
---
It becomes 5x more beneficial to play 1 hour for 5 days than 5 hours in 1 day. You are silly to not see how this could have disastrous consequences to the classic community seeing as how most of us have irl responsibilities which prevent playing an hour literally every day.
---
You are literally delusional for thinking 1 reddit post means everybody is full T1, specially when there is websites telling you how many characters there is on servers and their level range..
---
It is a popular opinion because I do the same.
---
Well the spell specifies melee attack power in its description
---
I've passed so many HoJ even before p1.5 you wouldnt even know. I've joined farming groups to help my fellow rogues out and so on. It's a melee trinket, it was bis for you but the DM book trinket is so much better. Would you like someone taking one of your crossbows because it's better than what they currently have?
---
thanks i wasnt aware of the discord, this is a great resource
---
The Earth is Round.
---
Popular things is l how we got retail though. Lfg was highly praised. Same with flying mounts. Daily quests. People loved it when they came out.
---
It sounds like you're running with a lot of people who are, to put it generously, "high-end" raiders. These are the kind of people who are focused on the go-go acquisition of loot and speed-clearing content. This isn't to rag on them - after all, I *wish* I had the gear they did - but that kind of mindset tends to draw in unsavory types, the kind that will ragequit over not getting an item drop or who will sell out their teammates in a heartbeat for an upgrade. You will continue to find people there that think themselves superior to others and thus demand special treatment. If you want to find a guild experience where the people within care about each other more than the items they're pursuing, that very much exists, but you're probably going to need to slow down a little. For instance, my guild only just killed Rag for the first time this past Sunday. We wiped to dumb things and there was heated discussion over why we were wiping, but at the end of the day, the boss died and everyone was thrilled. I'm not bosom friends with the majority of the guild, but I whisper my rogue friends with fun banter and have a dick-measuring contest with my warrior buddy. This experience is out there, if you want it.
---
What server/faction are you on, btw?
---
/r/PunPatrol
---
Freeze! You are under arrest!
---
Yeah, those are the good parts.
---
100% this... I loved BC... but if all they are gonna do is te release their old shit then they are truest a dead company.... 
---
All this Bs with classic+ and TBC... what the community really should be screaming for is WoW 2..... why is this not even an option? Updated servers, updated game engine... use classics game design.... if anything classic has shown people want something different .. no one is gonna but shadowlands... people want something new and challenging
---
[This](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/priest-talents/?tal=50023213002000023050100000000000502322103310000) was the spec I was considering going for PvP, for the same reason as you are. I don't really have any input for yours since we hit the useful talents, the last few points are just playstyle dependent!
---
Cool, I didn't know about the forcing new players to choose BFA.  I think story-wise that's actually a good choice.
---
I can also understand what you are saying about abilities, but I only think it will accomplish that goal if it actually forces people to do some group content while leveling (and not group content that is so nerfed you can just auto attack your way through it while pulling half the dungeon.)  
---
If all I have to do to level is kill some crappy quest mobs and never do any group content before I'm sent to the new expansion in 20 or 30 hours played I don't think a new player gets much more out of it than they would just a scenario that gives them their abilities (sort of like the DK or DH scenarios.)
---
&gt;Legacy-Spammers: What do you think the chances are of a guy like me and a realm like classic…ending up together?
---
&gt;Blizzard: Not good.
---
&gt;Legacy-Spammers: You mean, not good like one out of a hundred?
---
&gt;Blizzard: I’d say more like one out of a million.
---
&gt;Legacy-Spammers: So you’re telling me there’s a chance. Yeah!
---
This is probably my favorite, and really embodies the snark and shilliness of that megathread.  Poor guys are probably playing classic, getting to lvl 10 and thinking "where are all the menus?  Why can't I queue?"
---
What if they went all the way to wrath and THEN branched off?
---
In Cata I solo'd MC on my freshly leveled warrior and on my first run I got both bindings and the eye. Immediately after that I solo'd BT and got the MH glaive, and the following week got the OH.
---
No you are wrong LOOOL, spell batching was literally in vanilla, allowing things like this to happen, holy shit you couldnt had picked a worst example :D :D :D
---
Looks like the roll timer is different for each of the items.  Did they drop on different mobs from the same pull? 
---
Maybe they didn't drop at the same time
---
What do we do now?
---
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
---
You're insulting people for having more free time than you? Am I understanding this correctly?
---
no people, their guilds
---
On horde, you just sit back and let all the warriors and rogue with windfury carry you.
---
None of these private servers ever blindly trusted client side input what the fuck are you talking about. You're just completely making stuff up
---
That poor 70 warlock.... How'd he make it that far?
---
Because he said he only needed since Drakestone was on his BIS list.
---
Idk why old is automatically flawed. The itemization and talent trees in classic are still unsurpassed. These are the same devs (from the same era) who gave you wc3 and d2. The new devs gave you WoD and bfa. I can’t even trust them to keep Wpvp running smoothly, how can we trust them to make a decent concept on their own?
---
Ooo I like this one better.
---
Activision wouldn't be able to pull classic+ and do it right.They had plenty of expansions to try.Would be broken retail just.
---
They could try add one raid like Ulduman is in current world as a test tho
---
Wouldn't pick anyone else's
---
Mobs have a minimum of 1% chance to resist, regardless of the level difference or your +hit (which wouldn't be relevant here anyway since they're so low). If you nova 10 mobs there's about a 10% chance one of them's going to resist (1 in 10 pulls), pull 20 and it's 18% (one in 5), 30 and it's 26% (one in 4). They might have some additional cold resist that makes it even more likely. 
---
It's just a reality you have to deal with when you're pulling a big group. All you can do is, like the other answer says, snap and nova again.
---
Naxx stuff carried until around 65 maybe. T1 was replaced within an hour. T2 seemed to maybe last until 63 at the latest.
---
Ah great thanks
---
By reading literally anything anywhere instead of fucking over the rest of their group because theyre selfish.
---
You don't have to justify anything to me, I'm not the one that's salty about not getting to play as much as I want.
---
To easy for someone who doesnt have the time for long stretches of gaming in one session. I dont understand whats so hard to understand about that point. Im saying I can only play casually, Im not even raiding in classic.
---
This.
---
&gt; What reason is there to keep playing if you're already done with everything you wanted to experience, and there's no hope of new content on the horizon? 
---
Ask the people that have been playing vanilla for 15 years. The game doesn't get worse because you finish it, it's still the game you love. You might get bored of it, but others won't. Some people would re-roll on a fresh server and play Vanilla WoW until the day they died. Me personally, I look forward to doing classic and then TBC, that should last me 3-4 years. I can't tell you how I'm going to feel after that, all I can tell you is I don't want classic+ while that's a possibility.
---
It's really just the machine that is dumb.  Asking a massive cohort of people to create a uniform creative vision is just stupid.
---
That's why you pamper the fuck out of your OG creators.  They're the ones that embody the original concept and will continue to pursue it.
---
Lol I’m aware but it was better then what I had at the time and it’s rogue piece anyway hunters shouldn’t be rolling on it
---
That's not what I was saying at all. I'd love to play BC as well, I wasn't saying I don't. BC was my favorite version of the game. My pont is that if they go that route, they are giving the game a limited lifespan. I'd rather have Classic+ which, if successful, I can play for years to come. They can even incorporate BC content into a potential Classic+. My point still stands though. Once I have done all the content in BC (I raided up to Sunwell during retail BC), what reason do I have to keep playing when I know there is no chance of new content? The playerbase will eventually die off once people run out of things to do.
---
Also if they release TBC, they will eventually HAVE to release Wrath. But like the people that prefer to stay on Classic servers when TBC is released, I won't be moving on to Wrath. Wrath is the point IMO where the game REALLY started to diverge into what we see now in retail. You'll have 3 separate playerbases playing 3 separate expansions.
---
Favorite feature? You can select which games you want it to display an icon for!
---
For me it's Arena and the raids. After that I'm fine with bc+.
---
Donkey did.
---
I mean I wanna do videos, I wanna share what I do, this is who I am. I like to share, make more out of it and mostly having fun with others. B8t it is very tiresome to stream, sometimes I just wanna play for myself. That is why I love fishing. :D
---
Arthas didn't

You want this quest reward: [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10659/shard-of-afrasa](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10659/shard-of-afrasa)
---
5 mana and 5 health per second trinket.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7720/whitemanes-chapeau](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7720/whitemanes-chapeau) from Scarlet Monastery is amazing.
---
Thanks for the complement Sim &lt;3. I sadly lost the rest of the "walking" footage, so I had to improvise.
---
This is so wrong on so many levels. You’re making up blatant lies just to defend Blizzard.
---
I've still got ways to go then. Had to move his hind paws away from the keyboard a few times to avoid him messing the rotation up ;)
---
Because greens can be better for you while that belt is bis until phase 3 or 4
---
Well yes, but Im of the opinion that edgemaster on humans is kind of a waste.
---
Dailies suck. The conversation is always framed around which ones aren't that bad rather than which ones are fun.
---
So a legendary becomes a glorified portal item. Much wow.
---
Honestly until ZG~AQ gear the strong scaling classes aren't significantly better than the poor scaling ones.
---
For now though, hunter is good, rogue and mage are better than warrior and warlock, ret/enhance/feral/elemental/balance aren't dead weight, etc
---
I wanna know what world you live in where a week starts on a Tuesday. Of course people would take meaning that the 12th would be the release date.
---
You are focusing exclusively on the hunter rolling and missing that the warrior did not specify prior to the run about reserving HoJ.  It's not as useful for the hunter but a significant upgrade is an upgrade.  As a hunter, I wouldn't roll on it.  But I wouldn't fault someone who did.

If the warrior desired the HoJ and declined to reserve it because he thinks his big dick dps BiS list speaks for him, fuck him.  If you assume loot belongs to you without saying a goddamn word during the run, which is not unknown for what it drops, you are the asshole, not the hunter who probably assumed it was fair for him to roll.
---
You want to stop hunters rolling on BiS for other classes, master loot or say it up front.  Don't assume everyone has read YOUR bis list.
---
Ah right right.
---
Wish we had some numbers.....would love to know how many people play classic now :/
---
I joined a pre established guild and my primary goal was to tank my recommendation to people wanting to get into that role but dont have a core group of people to depend on is do dungeon runs and be sociable, i got into my group because a priest added me after a solid and supportive run  
---
i got invited to the guilds ubrs to tank for them by said priest and thats  how i got my foot in the door
---
downside is you are going to have to do a ton of grunt work before you can get into one of the core tank slots, attunements random runs and just helping lowbies are going to be a mainstay(believe me i see the inside of BRD in my dreams ive been there so many times) but this way people will start to remember your name and that you are a competent tank, it will help deal with tanxiety and get you more comfortable with all sorts of people so you can make friends be sociable, and most importantly, be a person people can depend on because when you become an asset to the guild, the guild will want to invest in you, make guild positive decisions and work with the officers to figure out a common goal and you should be set from there
---
Looks good af.
---
There’s definitely a loop in the code that keeps rolling until one person has a higher roll.
---
I don't think you get what the Blizzard method does...In the private server version the character dies or doesn't (based on who is cheating) and the battle is changed in real time. 
---
In the classic version whether someone is trying to cheat or not the game plays correctly. 
---
Banning for cheating doesn't play into the equation at all. What Blizzard's checks do is make sure that the game is fair in real time.
---
The culture hasn't gotten pretty tired of it, a vocal minority that try to ruin people's lives over it have used the internet to be even more vocal.
---
People cared and "freaked out" about it then and they were still the minority, they just got laughed at and had no power. Now you have to cater to people like that and I have no interest in it. If you don't want to hear what other people say that hurts your feelings for other people then by all means ignore them or leave.
---
But pretending everyone else is the problem is just stupid. I have no interest in catering to people that want to gut my rights over their feelings. Especially when a lot of them crying the loudest aren't even from the US.
---
Imagine being a rogue and rolling on a caster dagger 😂 my pride will not let me equip a caster dagger when I can just go to the AH and find something much better
---
Exactly. I get the appeal of a large server, but Blizzard was frank as hell about the experience you were likely to have if you stayed on one.
---
I don't really get why though.
---
Having a whole online world to run around in is pretty neat.
---
Finally someone that understands statistics
---
Horde side so take with a grain of salt but usually we see people in my guild getting tribute buff, going to get songflower, then getting a port to Org and logging until head drops, then log off again until raid time. We do have a discord for scheduling head drops though so we know exactly what time it's going to be off CD and dropped.
---
I just hope with what ever they do they take their time doing. The can rush the retail experience all they want but I hope they take classic as a long term aged to perfection kind of tactic. I hope they take their time and do things slowly and well thought out.
---
what addon is this for the raid frames?
---
Honestly i feel like you would get most of the same utility with the full shadow PvP build then, plus you have killing power. And just do points in disc down to improved mana burn
---
Has anyone else found even Holy specced PvP to be insanely fun? I'm a Dwarf priest and the only 2 things I'm scared of are shamans and UD rogues. Almost every gank attempt has ended with me whomping them and barely losing any health. And I'm not even that good lol.
---
"That's the problem with building something idiot-proof. Someone will always build a bigger idiot."
---
No but I've had two of them break in different ways so I wouldn't be surprised if yours has some kind of issue. Seems they don't have the best quality control...
---
I think the warranty is 1 year, to process my claim they made me email a picture of the receipt.
---
Serious PvPers have to farm raids for gear in Classic. There's no such thing as a hardcore PvP guild that isn't also a hardcore raiding guild.
---
#nochanges    
---
/sarcasm 
---
For real though, it’s absolutely absurd. Especially with the 2019 mindset of “meta”. People put raid groups together as if they are going for world first speed runs. It’s ridiculous. “Ret pally? We don’t have a spot for you unless you heal. AND if you come, you can’t roll on dps gear”. Get the fuck out of here with that nonsense
---
The only way to hit 60 is to kill level 1 boars in the forest.
---
Yeah it's a quirk of vanilla. There's several weapons with procs that deal "fatal damage" and only deal like.. 130 damage, at any time regardless of the targets health.  
---
wowhead usually has the actual effects listed with them as well, so if you're ever confused you can check out wowhead to see what the actual effects are.
---
It actually never happened. Or there would be tons of videos of players hacking and trolling the crap out of these private servers. But there’s 0 videos because it never happened.
---
As a BM hinter, thank you!
---
Unpopular opinion: Blizzard should fix bugs and problems. Gib karma.
---
Call me out on using unpopular opinion for popular opinions? "Well u kant reed"
---
👏
---
Hopefully servers can handle it
---
But that's just dumb...
---
really? i haven't used clique too often. i liked mouseovers when i played on other servers, but i am down to try clique out
---
5 people pressing greed
---
That's clearly not the case considering they literally just said fewer layers = larger queues
---
Different checks in different games. Some games are also designed with a much better large scale pvp engine underlying that can shard calculations, but these were made later than wow. Other games handle it differently, such as Eve with their time distortion bubbles for large scale pvp to ensure they can still perform all the checks.
---
What I want is for these discussions to stop for like the next year while we enjoy what we have. Greedy ass people already asking for more.
---
Take your thought one step further and ask yourself: “why wouldn’t they try to bring retail back in line with the parts of classic that people love?” Why continue development on classic or TBC when you can just try to funnel these players back into the retail stream after Phase 6? 
---
That’s what i see happening with Shadowlands and beyond. 
---
I thinks it’s an obvious business strategy for Blizzard.
---
Classic + makes more sense for Blizzard. Their retail version is failing. It has hype and probably pulls in quite a bit of money still but it’s clear that Classic, as a trend or one-off, is where it’s at. It’s not even a question about long-term anymore. Companies chasing the short term should recognize Classic’s need.
---
That said, I don’t think they should, personally. It would make no sense. Then again, they’re the ones who did the stupid alternate timeline bullshit, so it could still be canon.
---
There is no right answer here, imo. No matter which way Blizzard choose, we will end up with a big number of dissatisfied people.
---
Azeroth, for the last 15 years.
---
Hi there!
---
Sorry for getting back to you only now. I cannot sim your character, so I don't think you linking your gear makes the decision easier. As I mentioned, I don't really know how the weapon speed enchants add up. You could go through your own logs to check that tho: Take a boss where you are not moving a lot and is just tank and spank.  Check what your DPS is on the fight (also check your Flurry uptime for the calculation below). I don't think the Iron Counterweight is that expensive, so once you have a benchmark of your DPS is, than do the same with the Iron Counterweight enchant and see what the increase in DPS is.
---
For Crusader, the proc chance per hit is weapon speed  \* 1.82 ([source](https://rogerkarlsson.com/blogs/wow/crusader/)). This will give you 100 strength for 15s, which will increase your AP by 200 and thus your flat DPS by 14.3. This comes down to an average 1.1 proc per minute, which translates to a 27.3% average uptime on the Crusader buff, or an average DPS increase of 3.9. (I assume WF hits can proc Crusader, if they can't please ignore this section) Now with WF, you increase this by hitting 1.4 times more (2 extra attacks every 5 hits on average), so now your average uptime on Crusader is 38.2%. On top of that, during the Crusader uptime you also benefit form WF, potentiating your Crusader by 1.4x. This comes down to a 7.6 DPS increase. (The following section assumes that Flurry and WF function multiplicatively. If they don't please ignore) If you have Flurry on top of that, you hit an additional 1.3x more, modified by its uptime. If you have a 50% Flurry uptime, you hit on average 1.15x more, for an average Crusader uptime of 44% and an average DPS increase of 10.1 (the same potentiating effect for Flurry on Crusader DPS applies as did for WF). If you have a perfect 100% Flurry uptime, you hit on average 1.3x more, for an average Crusader uptime of 49.7% and an average DPS increase of 12.9. 
---
All of this is assuming you are not allowed to use Stormstrike on the boss. 
---
**TLDR**: For a Flurry uptime between 50-100%, if your Iron Counterweight does more than 10.1-12.9 extra DPS it is better than Crusader.
---
100s of runs, so about as rare as HOJ then
---
I personally loved TBC. I don't want flight to be a thing again though. That's my sole reason for wanting Classic+ instead of TBC.
---
Wait a goddamned minute. Isn’t the defense on the offhand sword?!?
---
Ya and pick herbs if you have it. Can also sell the ring that drops of princess for ~20g bonus gold if you find a buyer
---
why not kings?
---
Monday, the 11th is a holiday.
---
I just waited until 45.  The wand taps are a lot of your passive damage.
---
I never said otherwise. I said the *point* of them is for that.
---
Nothing has convinced me Activision is actually capable of doing what the old Blizzard did.
---
I think almost everyone is on the same page that *if* they were capable of developing the game in the spirit of vanilla, classic plus would be dope.
---
However I struggle to imagine how anyone thinks that possible. What would actually happen is just a second shit version of the game.
---
TBC is a full on themepark, Classic tried to be sandboxy, and that sandbox aspect is what we need to embrace, not the themepark aspect.
---
Exactly how I feel. I loved WoW in 2006-2007, but I was so young and clueless, I really didn't even get to experience the best parts of the game. Didn't raid in vanilla or BC, raiding for the first time in WotLK and never even got a full clear in that. Now I've got 2 Felheart pieces and working on a full set :D Classic is the shit!
---
Was hoping to get some opinions on this. Did a Strat Live run last night, 4/5 of group were guildies. 
---
First orb drops and everyone rolls greed, the usual, then our guildie priest rolls need. Myself and someone else in the group brought it up and said that it’s not fair for everyone to roll greed and you come in and need on it (essentially ninjaing it). And he was like I need it for my true faith robes, which is fair enough, but mentioning it after the fact is kinda slimy. Those orbs are used in a lot of recipes and also very valuable, so everyone technically needs them.
---
So going forward we agree that everyone rolls need (except him) until we all have an orb, which is unlikely but whatever.
---
Fast forward a few minutes and i get a message from our guild master saying that the priest gets all the orbs for his truefaith vestments ‘for the guild’. I respond saying that’s really not fair to the rest of the group, especially since he didn’t mention anything from the outset. And then guild master says too bad, that’s what’s happening. Keep in mind, the guild master wasn’t even in the group with us!
---
Luckily no other orbs dropped, but I thought that that was ridiculous. So now I’m looking for a new guild that isn’t so authoritative lol. 
---
Am I in the wrong for feeling this way, or is it justified given it’s ‘for the guild’?
---
Cheers everyone

This is irrelevant to the point that you are missing. Regardless of the wants of the community and the needs of share holders, ATVI will do what's best for shareholders everytime. As they should, as that's who has the vested interest. If those wants and needs cross paths then everyone wins, sometimes that's the case.
---

---
I'm pretty sure HotS and Hearthstone are both more recent than 25 years
---
Horde player here. Well said OP, would love to see the server balance out a little before PvP releases.
---
Had a discussion with some guildies over everyone's obsession with bis lists while raiding.  It is weird to know your bis 1.5 years ahead of time.  Theorycrafting and coming up with bis for the current tier can be super fun, but its also all been done before.  Everything (for the most part, looking at you Onyxia threat mechanics with Guid thing) has been figured out.  Also with the game launching in 1.12 state everything is super face roll because all the class iterations, buffs, itemization has already happened.  Plus we're also much better players and have way more info to go on. We launch in a later state of the game and can exactly target the gear to make the raids as quick as possible.  Now is this sustainable for the full cycle of Classic?  I feel like TBC would go the same route.  Some of that magic is still lost.  
---
I'm currently more leaning towards the classic+ route.  I'd love to see the debuff limit removed, a taunt mechanic added to prot pally, maybe embrace the shaman tank, maybe some love to the meme specs via cool class specific items.  Not talking an overhaul at all, just the little stuff.  Then from there we get a new raid and a new dungeon or 2, so we have some new items to mess with and come up with our own theorycrafting.  Can create new BiS lists, new playstyles, and it would capture that feeling of mystery of what could be next.  Instead of with TBC we know the outcome although of course we would still enjoy the journey.
---
Nochanges was only meant to avoid any discussion about anything that could make the game better.
---
It's a phrase for lazy cowards
---
This is just inaccurate, how would they release tbc without upping the cap?
---
Essentially you have 5 burritos and they all have too much chilli in them. Selectively moving chilli from one burrito to another can't solve the situation. Even getting a new burrito and filling it with chilli won't help, you still have to eat them all. At the end of the day you just have to much chilli.
---
2 handers hit hard af. Most of the time your window to actually hit warlocks, mages, hunters, rogues is a fraction of a second every few seconds due to CC or range. This generally also allows your super slow swing timer to reset the by the next time you’re in range/uncced. The result is more overall damage during those small windows where you’re actually on your target.
---
I mean, if all you're doing is wanding, you're playing wrong.
---
omfg... I'd be fuming
---
so many for rep grinding
---
But that’s just going to be what TBC is like anyways right? Daily’s, Heroics, Flying Mounts, etc.
---
Cold snap
---
Ye misdirect in classic
---
Misdirect doesn't exist in classic.
---
with permafrost talent its much better to rely on the slow from cone of cold while kiting instead of nova into blizz
---
Your brother is clearly a sociopath.
---
Dailies in TBC never were never "You've got an hour to put the dishes away or I throw them in the garbage"-like, lol. Like wtf is that blind hate about? You could do 0 dailies in TBC for months and be totally fine. You're just spitting on everything that isn't classic for some reason. And farming gold via dailies in TBC was equally dumb/super-fun-grind than farming DM east /whatever spot in Classic.
---
It would be super easy to supress the few bad elements of TBC and still release most of the rest of the game. It's what i'm curious to see : will blizzard have the courage to change the few things in TBC that are not in the Classic spirit.
---
&gt; Classic won't last long-term anyways. When all the content is cleared in two years give or take, people will stop playing it since there is nothing left to do.
---
Yeah... if they don't add new content to it, it will. Old School Runescape is going on about 6 years old now and shows no sign of slowing down. They have used the Classic+ format and it has been very successful. 
---
&gt;On the topic of just adding more content to Classic (Classic+), I'd have to argue that this would probably destroy the game. No matter how you look at it, piling on more raids and stuff after Naxx will destroy Classic. More raids means higher item level. Higher item level means older content gets trivialized. At that point, might as well give us TBC.
---
People were still running MC by the time BC was released. Kara/Gruul/etc was still being done up until the daily welfare gear was added in BC. It can definitely be done if they are smart about it. Maybe make the progression more sideways and less vertical. Release a T3.5 dungeon with slight upgrades or sidegrades to Naxx gear. Keep raids like MC and BWL relevant by NOT adding in welfare gear.
---
The only reason early tiers of raids were ever made obsolete was because of welfare daily gear, and eventually LFR. Those were the mechanics that killed raiding for previous tiers.
---
&gt; The biggest hope I have is, that if they do TBC, that they make some changes to it. The reason people prefer Classic over retail is, because a lot of the really good things about Classic have gone lost over the past 13 years. And Blizzard needs to figure out what it is and make sure that future expansions (like TBC+ and WotLK+) won't make the same mistakes again.
---
If you do TBC and beyond expansions, you run into the issue where some of the things implemented (such as flying mounts, badge gear, etc) in the core game were big parts of the reason that retail is in the state it's in. They'd have to change fundamental parts of the game in order to keep it in line with the Classic mindset.
---
If Old School Runescape can be as successful as it has been using this format, I don't know why Classic WoW can't.
---
How would they be any more ghost towns if they allowed people to copy than if they allowed only transfers off?
---
Not a subreddit but a sort of meta guides website i found: http://www.vanilla-info.com/
---
But is it objectively better? What did TBC do that classic+ couldnt do?
---
also streamers
---
&gt; because team leader doesn't mark 
---
That's your job as tank and I say this as a tank. Expecting other people to do it will never work you have to do it yourself and even then DPS are still mouth breathing retards who will ignore it 50% of the time.
---
Going into TBC would be a mistake. When do they stop? WOTLK or just continue their trends of running all the way back to BFA? Classic needs to be cherished as much as possible, conserve what we have and add onto it in ways that expands the current play style without oversaturating the game and dumbing everything down that happened with retail. TBC would be an easy way out and would lead them down the same path retail went.
---
You're correct I think. It's too bad, but there unfortunately is no easy way forward after naxx is on farm.
---
That's a matter of perspective and personal experience. In my experience, its useful knowing I only have a 60% chance of receiving a drop by its alleged drop rate. If your average player knew that, there would be half as many complaints about drop rates, I call that useful.
---
Go kill whelps
---
They can have a voting system like runescape, wich worked great there.
---
TBC might have been more balanced but the rest of TBC foundation isn't good enough to warrant a + version.
---
TBC trivialized all of the zones from vanilla WoW, just like how every time a new expansion is released the older zones might as well be deleted from the game.
---
Flying mounts were introduced too early in the life of WoW. It killed world PvP as well as the questing and removed the need to interact with the environment.
---
No longer having individual cities for Horde and Alliance removed a lot of that community aspect. Dueling outside Org, invading SW etc...
---
Expansion wise TBC was great but it's not good to be the base of for WoW+
---
IMO a better approach would be Classic+ with somethings taken from TBC like class balance instead of TBC+
---
I don’t get what the long term vision of Classic+ is.
---
It has all of the same pitfalls as TBC with none of the known benefits of TBC.
---
You can’t even give a singular definition of what classic+ is, because what it promises is different to different people.
---
Some think no new levels should be introduced. Why? Because they want classic content to remain relevant.
---
So how does Blizzard implement this?
---
A new raid? With the same or slightly higher ilvl as Naxx content? Is this new content a step up or a step sideways?
---
So what about the next content? A new zone, new quests? Another new dungeon? What ilvl are the rewards there? On par with EPL and endgame dungeons? A step up or step sideways?
---
What about the next bit of content and the next and the next?
---
Do the complexity and difficulty of these encounters rise and do the rewards rise with them?
---
Baseline classes already have scaling issues vs hybrids. If new content comes out with power increases those scaling issues increase as well.
---
If new content is harder but rewards don’t adequately scale, players wont invest their time as they avoided Naxx back in the day. For many the effort wasn’t worth the reward. To get into this new raid are you required to gear up through Naxx?
---
I just don’t know how new content is released without increasing power and if power is increased it further exacerbates issues in Classic.
---
If new dungeons come out then those will eventually eclipse raids and make raid content meaningless which defeats the purpose of keeping level 60 the max level to keep old content relevant.
---
If new expansions are developed with new levels and changes than it ceases to be classic and you get all the issues if tbc with all the unknowns of Classic+.
---
I hate to say it but Classic content does eventually have an expiration date and that’s okay.
---
And if you’re hoping for new expansions made in the philosophy of classic but avoid the trappings of TBC and WotLK while also keeping Classic content relevant then I think you’re asking for the impossible.
---
Eventually power creep will happen with Classic+ content. And if the new content doesn’t measure up to Classic you’ll end up with fractured communities the same way as with TBC or WotLK.
---
You need 40 hrs a week to get like rank 11
---
So, who is going to camp the mountain nonstop from 15th Nov till AV launches?
---
Warlords had dropped within a month or two once everyone realized there was literally nothing to do outside of raid, and garrisons had flopped massively.
---
but in classic, there isnt a glutton of gold in the markets.
---
I know you don't want a serious answer, but: Supply and demand
---
Honestly the only reason I ever even look at it is to hit play 😉. Has that new steam UI look.
---
That's Luna unit frames. Absolutely love it.
---
To many problematic mechanics and features were introduced by that time. It was fun at the time but looking back I would not want to replay through it.
---
The fact that there are fewer people willing to tank. What don't you understand about supply and demand?
---
Supply and demand. When there are not enough tanks for the groups that want them they can make whatever demands they want.
---
You don't have to give in by any means. Just find another group and/or tank.
---
Loot
---
Am I the only one who thinks shadowlands is actually a precursor to how they plan on implementing classic+?
---
If they choose to balance all of the end of expansion gear to a specific level they can then squish everyone to 50 from 60, TBC becomes 50-60, vanilla 10-50 repeat for each expansion till classic dies or Wow2.
---
They can just leave flying disabled for Azeroth and give additional talent points to compensate for the 2.0/3.0 talent trees.
---
My prot pally buddy shelled out some gold for a flurry axe. According to him, the axe has a 5% proc rate and your SoR counts as a hit that can also proc the axe too, so its equivalent to 10% procrate for paladin. 
---
The axe has lower physical dps, but the extra attacks make significantly more SoR damage. Also, faster weapons scale SoR better with spell damage on gear (it gets 10% of your spell power, regardless of weapon speed.) 
---
Its helped his single target threat a good deal, but i dont know if it will be much help in situations where dps start too early, like youre describing.
---
agreed.  mine never come out looking like math equations
---
Because there's so much fewer tanks than healers. Seems pretty obvious to me
---
I laughed out loud at work and got caught on reddit, thanks
---
Just two weeks ago they made a fix because people were soloing the end game hunter quests by kiting boss away from guards. Any mobs that are meant to be in groups 
---
Ie (Raptor and baby raptor) (body guards)(pets) will all come together, stay together and leave together.
---
Sure it does, it means the quality of the content was worth the time investment to be in a top tier guild.
---
I was 19, and I knew 30 year olds that played back in vanilla. Wow always had a very wide demographic, makes it very hard to generalize.
---
Then don’t do it.
---
The ONLY way this retaining pre-outland classic could possibly work is to have every current server automatically become a TBC server.
---
Then, create a single new Classic-60 server for each region with free transfers for characters 1-60. As soon as a character reaches level 61 or zones into Outland, they may no longer transfer.
---
Create more Classic-60 servers as necessary, or (more likely) merge into multi-region servers as necessary.
---
Hand held content. In TBC if you are PVP.er, your most efficient way to play the game is sit in town, queueing for arena's, if you do ANYTHING else, you are wasting your time. In Classic, if you want the absolute best PVP gear in an MMORPG wich Classic is, you need to go through the entire thing, and everything the game has to offer.
---
So your a ninja. It's called ninja looting you fucken idiot.
---
4. employed in a way that doesn’t require much attention

Wait what? Really? Can you go into further detail? That sounds awful

Agree, it really feels like you are the random soldier of an army screaming at the enemy
---
omg dude lols

&gt;Information is ammunition, and knowing is half the battle.
---
-Battletech, G.I.Joe
---
Supply and demand is a precarious thing. Different for every server, time, and person/group.
---
Personally I hate the blizzard build/style of ZF farming, I've been doing the Flamestrike CoC kiting build (0/19/32) clears are so much faster and more stable (even if nova/CoC resists it doesn't matter as much). Frosterdomus (or however it's spelled) went over it in his ZF farming video after around 100 hours of using this build I agree it is superior; it does take some time to get used to tho.
---
Pretty sure it's curiosity not greed.
---
What is the issue with free transfers from those servers? Faction imbalance or something?
---
Did you bind them in darkness?
---
I understand that.  My point is that blizzard should consider shifting their architecture towards that of private server since it obviously offered a better user experience.
---
You dont have to read BiS lists just read the fucking item and don't be a completly ignorant asshole.
---
"Equip: chance on MELEE hit to gain 1 extra attack."
---
"HAHAHAH DUMB WARRIORS DIDN'T EVEN RESERVE THIS ITEM GUESS I'LL ROLL NEED."
---
Pathetic.
---
Because then everyone will only play on bc servers. It's a snowball effect, people want to play where the people are. The people are mostly on bc servers, so they'll be more inclined to stick to bc to stick with people. It's kinda a vicious cycle. People are mostly on bc, so more people migrate to bc, making the problem worse.
---
That's his rate. If you don't agree then don't use him why did you even argue with him? This is like going to a grocery store to buy milk, you think it's too expensive and you start arguing with the store manager.
---
To potentially save someone else my confusion, these appear to be the odds of 3 out of 5 people rolling a 100.  I was totally convinced at first that it was one in a million (1/100\^3) to get three people rolling 100, but that misses part of the scenario where 5 people rolled and we don't care which 3 roll 100.
---
Nothing you can do about that except have there be one global multi-lingual server.
---
Let me say that I would enjoy bc and classic plus. However I think adding alterations is a slippery slope. "Fixing" classes in pve like enhance sham, ret pally, shadow priest, boomkin would all have enormous meta shifting effects on both pve and pvp. Will it make raids too ez, will it make a faction too op, or will it lower the skill ceiling that already exists for those classes? 
---
Tbh I am personally happy with the game as is. But I understand if people get bored in 2 years. However idk if the answer is the change the game.
---
Blizzard can pay for better server infrastructure instead of running their shards on an AWS micro
---
OR I can unsub and go play a better, less buggy, more performant version of Vanilla FOR FREE
---
Idk why but I love watching him talk, he was such a angry gamer back in the day!
---
I would have started at launch instead of 5 weeks after
---
Verbatim what I’ve been saying as well. 
---
Keep Classic and TBC separate on the client.
---
I want to continue Warrior tanking in TBC, but if I can’t *copy* my full t3 Thunderfury wielding Warrior to TBC, I’ll start leveling a new Warrior a while in advance to transfer (if that’s the route they take).
---
Different games though. You dont really queue up abilities in WoW like you do in EVE, like it taking a few minutes for things to play out in a huge scale fight isnt as devastating as it is in WoW. Its like trying to compare chess to starcrat or something.
---
Binomial probability distribution of a random variable? Nah
---
50/50? Yes
---
Resilience is horrible for an MMORPG. This is how you play as a PVP.er after resilience:
---
Sit in town and queue for arenas, period. Nothing else, it would be a waste of your time.
---
Doesnt feel right that a blue geared player can destroy a full T6 player, the effort isnt nearly the same. 
---
But ultimately, this is an MMORPG, not a PVP game like LoL, you should have to go through the entire content the MMO has to offer to have the absolute best gear.
---
and for Alliance guilds it's a ret Paladin.
---
If you're that self aware that you're clueless, you don't let yourself need before asking questions for more information.
---
It's all part of the Classic vibe.
---
The problem is, it's too hard to get fair assessments from players if we ask them to include trade goods or other valuable items. People assess things so differently, sometimes too high, sometimes too low. This is at least a simple metric by which people can just tally up all their gold and we can see where people stand in pure gold.
---
So far I'm mainly at lower levels where they don't have Kings yet in their build.
---
To be fair, it's kind of ridiculous that you expected 39 people to pause the raid to wait for you.
---
I payed 100g for Treant’s bane the other day, I guess that’s an exception
---
A friend was trying to get me to play retail, I logged onto my paladin, who was 116 at the time. I saw maybe 3 people out in the world questing on my way to 120, which I got in like 2 hours. 2 hours would maybe be a single level on classic. 
---
The first time I saw someone in the world, I tried to buff them and I realized they made it so you can't fucking buff other people without taking them off yourself.  I don't understand their design decisions at all. Who asked for this shit?
---
I'll play classic for as long as it exists.  The day they announce TBC is the day I quit wow again, for good.
---
Yeah instead you get salty at the fact other people have lives outside of WoW.
---
Much better.
---
Or you know....TBC.
---
Yesss two more days to get to 60 and not being a faming target
---
&gt;I wish them well because i only run with guildies now as pugs just are not worth my time.
---
this is the real secret, join a good guild, cozy up to the tanks, profit
---
If people wanna do BC, let em switch. The whole point of vanilla (classic) is just that, I don’t think I speak for everyone but I do think most of us here want strictly vanilla.
---
Yes. They're already so Horde dominated that releasing more FT off will likely doom the server to never open AQ.
---
How does being casual prevent you from typing " x class prebis classic" into a search engine and clicking the first link
---
You also have to account for the other 2 party members **not** rolling a 100, so it'd be (1/100)^3 * (99/100)^2
---
Why don't you tank?
---
or 1/1000 if you just want 3 matching rolls instead of a 100 roll specifically.
---
opinion: you are a selfish idiot
---
Yea but what happened afterwards? Did the "magical PVP stat" become weaker with WOTLK or stronger? It became worst and worst and worst, and TBC brought that to the game.
---
Classic+ above all, once they start TBC they basically bury classic+ as an idea on top of fucking over everything.  
---
  Also, people don't want classic TBC, most people want it with changes so there's already a big problem there.
---
Ez ranking for Horde
---
&gt; using Nightfall weapon to apply armor reduction to raid bosse
---
It's spell damage increase, not an armor reduction.
---
Okay then what exactly was so risky about taking the exact idea that TF2 was then updating the graphics and adding some new heroes/changing heroes abilities? Adding super moves?
---
How come people don't like resilience?
---
You said no but then agreed with me
---
There is already tons of segregation in WoW, with different realms, and retail and classic, all are thriving in their own right, or thriving enough. What makes you think another one will change that?
---
They're just going to add a bunch of microtransactions and then nickle and dime any update with content. Most of that content being more microtransactions.
---
So couldn't some horde transfer to heartseeker?
---
perhaps their life does not revolve around a game?
---
To rule them all.

It's hilarious that you think alternating abilities after a set interval is hard, you must know some pretty stupid people.
---
clueless players shouldnt play warrior
---
i'd rather guilt trip my guildies into doing for free!
---
You should be using at least rank 2 consecrate on every pull, you need all the holy damage you can muster to hold aggro. If the dps pull the primary target off me on trash pulls I let them have it, and focus on the other adds. If it’s a boss, i use max rank consecrate l, judge wisdom first then switch back to SoR. BoP then if it gets hairy on boss the remember to hit them with salvation again after you get it back. 
---
Contrary to popular belief, I’d you get a good 2-3 seconds on a boss you can out-threat even great dps.
---
no, my argument is that it's not fair to suggest they don't take risks.
---
Horde outnumber alliance on every PvP server. On certain servers alliance guilds transferred early on and in some cases this has snowballed to significantly affect the alliance/horde ratio. This has long term impacts on the economy/pve/PvP.
---
&gt;you can’t pvp in the sky
---
That does sound pretty fun though
---
giga yikes
---
I feel you man a tucking did the exact same thing to Me even used the same logic to make him feel good about ninjaing a item that is literally fucking useless for a hunter like for real duck hunters
---
I’m insulting people that think the game should be updated to keep up with their pace, which normal people who leave their basement can’t keep up with.
---
So if you have large amounts of free time and spend all that time on WoW, yeah I’m probably insulting you.
---
Good to know, thanks. I'm probably way overdue to learn how to make marking macros anyway.
---
You can queue to log in that's good enough.
---
Does that mean they also take these posts seriously?
---
tbc all the way
---
I would a always rather have the option. Instead of the tank just saying no it's better for groups if they make an offer then let the group decide yes or no.
---
Try and get it before next raid. Other priests might be a little salty if you won it without being able to complete it for two weeks.
---
My friend heals me when tanking, and suggest I use a 2hander because healing is easy AF. So, any healers saying that are just bad at the game.
---
A GM will just step in and open it for them #somechanges
---
For the Mana issues. Start the pull with Max rank consecration, then down rank for the rest of the pull. Can do this with holy shield as well. Also rotate in some seal and judgement of wisdoms.
---
For the weapon go for your fast attack speed ones, especially something with a nice proc as the proc can happen on white damage and the yellow damage from seal of righteousness. For example I use flurry axe with the blazing enchant from Badlands quest (not much damage but it's aoe).
---
Some hidden threat generation you can utilize is spamming greater blessings of Kings (not as affective in 5mand but does help), and cleanse.
---
Just like there are many people who will show up for TBC and didn't show up for Classic.
---
I'm with you, though. I'd prefer C+ but realistically it's just not very likely to happen. TBC is almost a given at this point.
---
Yeah I'm waiting for TBC and would probably come back for that if they do it. Otherwise I'll just keep dicking around on private servers like I have been on and off the the last 10 years
---
Of course. Because you're a leveling guild. Any 60/close to 60 is going to leave the guild to find one where they'd actually find people to group with and raid with. 
---
Basing it off your guild is just silly. If I based it of mine I'd say 95% of players are already 60 and have MC on farm.
---
Its not vanilla at all LOL. 
---
1. New continent
---
2. Flying Mounts
---
3. Resilience
---
4. Tokens for gear
---
5. Shared main city
---
I can go on and on. Classic is an unfinished game, TBC is a ruined game in my opinion.
---
XD
---
People will definitely still play classic, but the large amount of classic servers will be too much for the people left over. There's no way we'll need the same amount of classic servers that we have no once bc launches, and I'm willing to bet the majority of people will go to bc.
---
gkick him
---
it's not necessary, it's a minor boost.
---
void robe is the only bop thing right now, it's prebis, you can replace it in MC, it will boost your dps like .5% over the next best.
---
in phase 4 you can get the bloodvine set, and having 300 tailoring with the full set gives you an extra 2% crit, which will boost your dps like 2.2% for having tailoring
---
Actually, yes.
---
If they allow transfers to TBC servers, instead of copying characters, then they can better evaluate how many people remain on Classic and decide to merge servers as necessary, while if people copy their Classic character to a TBC server and that character exists on both servers, it's much harder to decide what to do with Classic servers as the **active** population inevitably dwindles.
---
That said, there are more than enough Classic players who want nothing to do with TBC to keep many more than 1 Classic server alive.
---
Throwing out random, irrelevant numbers out there, for the sake of the discussion, but if there are 50 servers with 500,000 active characters and 400,000 of those active characters transfer to TBC, then they can merge those 50 servers into 10, to accommodate the remaining 100,000 active Classic players.
---
Press zugzug to show respect
---
sorry, can you repeat the question?
---
Classic+, I didn't really enjoy BC when it was released.
---
So what about all the additional talent trees and abilities? What about the gigantic reworks of how some classes function? Just because they made a squish on retail doesn’t mean we’re suddenly beholden to a WoW that won’t go past lvl 60.
---
Then will you stop at bc or continue on to panda land and beyond? See this is a problem.
---
This is awesome, thanks!
---
The attack power stat on items do but Might doesn't.
---
If the point of your survey is to see how much liquid cash the playerbase has after phase 1, then those players are effectively equal.
---
What?
---
All of the TBC classes largely played the same.
---
Pallies got Crusader Strike and Avenging Wrath but still relied on seals, judgments and Auras.
---
Warriors still played similarly.
---
Rogues were basically the same but with better energy generation and Cloak of Shadows.
---
Mages and Locks were still one button Andy’s.
---
Shamans basically played the same but duel wield and got Bloodlust.
---
Shadow Priests were mana batteries.
---
I don’t think any of the TBC classes played the same or were homogenized.
---
There were definitely huge skill gaps in PVE, arguably the PVE skill gap became much, much larger in TBC over Classic.
---
What are these "logs" everyone is referring to?
---
Why doesn’t blizzard only all specific faction moves. That’s the only thing I genuinely dislike about their approach.
---
I think it's better to see a couple more phases and how/if people's appetite for classic changes before discussing what you'd like to see in a hypothetical next iteration. 
---
To me it sounds like, for comparison's sake, people just getting to the point of having Karazhan on farm and wondering what the next expansion will be. Like, tap the brakes, please. Let this play out some.
---
With the obvious difference being that we technically know what is next.
---
Should've specd survival
---
You joking or no? It happened last time this was released. Mostly account sharing though.
---
But Azeroth is flat.
---
The healer either does or does not have mana... statistically...I'm pulling either way. 
---
-Warriors
---
But it's never worth the risk. Only hunters I know.
---
I hope I'll never meet someone like you.
---
that's the weakest argument ever, you need upgrades because they are upgrades if you are not needing on them then that can't be that much of an upgrade
---
PSA from Hunter to Shamans.
---
We wish you would stop grouping all of us in one group for the raid. We would love a totem of AGI, windfury does NOTHING for us. =0
---
I am a hunter, and in my experience in raids Hunters top the dps chart on probably 60-70% of the time, then sometimes mages do on a few bosses, and rarely rogues/warriors do.  I am not sure who you are raiding with, but hunters consistently do high dps in this phase.
---
&gt; Considering a ton of people who are 60 are just raid logging at this point anyway,
---
That point might be moot when PvP starts. I can't speak for others, but I'm much more interested in PvP than I am in PvE.
---
Except they could keep with the same systems like the talent tree and incorporate the newer content without changing the core of the gameplay
---
Rank 14, because you know it will never end.
---
Also the first person to be on the aggro list can hold aggro much more easily.
---
What’s that, four priests and a warrior?
---
ok Gollum
---
I feel it's a fair representation. But we have added about 80 people in the last week. I don't foresee anyone doing the g quit but yeah never know. 
---
 There's only 4 known guilds that raid on alliance and 3 for horde. Rest are pug groups usually lead by one of said guilds.
---
 May I ask if you rolled on one of the first servers available?
---
You don't get much out of holy until much later in the tree.  I healed dungeons all the to way to 60 with zero points in holy (and as a shadow priest from 40+), before respeccing to holy/disc at 60.
---
Disc/shadow is the way to go for leveling imo.  After your points in wand mastery and spirit tap, get 2 imp sw:p and 1 or 2 points in shadow focus, then put the rest in disc.  Inner Focus and Meditation are great for all purposes.  The entire middle of the shadow tree doesn't do much for you either, so avoid more shadow until you respec all shadow at 40 (if you choose to go that path).
---
Be real here no punishment would EVER happen in regards to that sort of “griefing”
---
I don't remember exactly how but I took my main dk to arthas and then used that save to get all of the alts so they just kill arthas.
---
This is how I do it, I bind them to Alt-1 through Alt-5 for the most important ones.  Very easy to mark before a pull or during a bad one.
---
They don't hurt anyone. You're just acting like trash.
---
I think you are part of a very small minority. People are divided but they are mostly divided between classic+and tbc. The amount of people who want just vanilla forever is incredibly small in comparison
---
anything has the same value to the party, if its a 10g bop or a 200g BoE the value that most people are putting on it is the gold value, if you are looking at the actual value of the item to someone then if it is an upgrade to someone then the gold value is 0, or the vendor value when they replace it but the value for how useful it is becomes a lot more to them than to anyone else
---
Sorry i forgot to mention it was me, the tank, and our hunter friend. We've all been leveling since anout 40+ and just recently started raiding together about a month ago. Were all in discord and have it downm as long as we avoid being dumb or me missing a heal because the tank is fury prot and duel wielding, we clear 10 minutes or less and hit the lockout. 
---
We had a few runs with almost pure weapon drops and others with nothing but 1g armor. Im addicted now though last night was insane. Warr made over 300 just from mining, arcanes go for like 50g a pop on Sulfuras.
---
I personally want a fresh proper MMO rather than classic+ or TBC, but that's never gonna happen.
---
Classic+ does have a ton of potential, and I would love to see blizzard explore it.. But it's NEVER going to happen. 
---
TBC is too clear of a choice. It has an already established fanbase(no matter how much they fuck around with TBC), there is WAY less work since the classic client essentially did like 50% of the job for them. 
---
So you have:
---
option a) Huge risk &amp; lots of work 
---
versus 
---
option b) No risk &amp; medium work. 
---
What do you think the company that required a 100k? signed petition, already highly played and loved pservers and 10+ years to be convinced to make classic will pick?
---
Yeah Evenquicker is dumb and redundant with Evenfaster.
---
You nailed it bro, well done.
---
Nah wowhead says a lot of things were added in 0.0.1 it's really annoying I made a similar mistake or two because of it
---
You aren't pre bis with 400+ healing... Prebis has over 600+ healing.
---
That extra healing would let you cast lower rank heals and be much more mana efficient.
---
Yeah but that'd be about as bad a decision as rolling a new Alliance character on Stalagg/Skeram
---
or you know, they're trying to correct the massive faction imbalance.
---
Idk. The hunter that tried to gank me right as I landed in gadget last night seemed to have his FD + Trap working just fine. I still beat him and spit on his corpse but the fact remains - he had it working down pat.
---
Hit is the best stat you can possibly have, hands down, until you're at/near the hit cap.
---
You will show Green Jesus the respect he deserve corpse-thing.
---
How is 2v2 or 3v3 was not designed for the game, all i see from this conversation is that all you do is mostly pve content, which is fine and that you hated esport. If you want a nice online game well you need to change some thing in the game to try and keep the game fresh. May i ask you a question, what class are you playing right now in classic?
---
You are grossly overstating the requirement to do dailies.
---
Using dailies to farm for EPIC flying was the poor mans way of making gold.
---
Proper gold making in TBC is no different than Classic, go out and farm: leather, herbs, ore or primals. Get lucky in Kara with Mongoose and rake in the cash. Sell raid mats or raid recipes or items for gold.
---
&gt; You don't play with enough tanks.
---
That's because I am a tank.
---
At beginning of run state you plan to cc any mobs you put a star on
---
Warlocks are one of the oddest classes for gear. There are as many best in slot green items than items from Molten Core. 
---
Choker of the Firelord, Nemesis Pants, Ring of Spell Power, Robe of Volatile Power (situational), Talisman of Ephemeral Power (situational), Sash of Whispered Secrets, Mageblade/Staff of Dominace. Those are the items you want from MC. Everything else is a downgrade from stuff you can get in 5 mans or the AH.
---
Felheart bracers are worse than a few other options, but none of those is super easy to get, and the bracers are still relatively solid, so if you get those, your time is better spent going after felcloth gloves, maleki's boots, etc
---
"go reserve your shadowlands pre order retail noob"
---
You are a fucking child
---
I've been fighting that fight too, dude.  The most compelling argument you can make is that, assuming roughly 8 days played to reach level 60, a person could have played for two hours *every single day since release* and still not be level 60.
---
See if someone wants to make the argument that two hours every single day for nearly 90 days straight is "casual."
---
"If you could learn how to remove buffs from yourself, that'd be great..."
---
Probably the early to mid 50s would be a good time. You can go the 30/21 holy/disc spec with some selections for pvp focused talents and still be a monster healer in dungeons with the raw healing bonuses from holy.
---
Indeed, any changes can be seen as “classic+”, but we are discussing Blizzard options, so it can be a + version with lower effort and less uncertainty
---
Because they didn't want to give 20 layers to one server and then have it be impossible to ever get it down to 1. They used the queues to persuade people to choose different realms rather than having one server be massively overpopulated while the rest suffer.
---
Hey how are you doing? Just wanted to drop https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-update-schedule-and-free-character-moves/357529 here.
---
In a way, the cash held by someone who is saving for something specific is "less liquid". Given 2 level 40s, one with mount and 15g, and another without mount but with 85g, it will be much harder for me to sell something to the person with 85g, despite them having more money.
---
Nah lol
---
I guess there is no such translator... :(
---
You also need to account that there are 5 chances to roll the number, not just 3.
---
Isn't BiS for PvP either. Soulseeker is way better as a stat stick
---
There’s a scarlet monastery quest that is for all horde races except for undead. It’s to find out some shit they’re hiding, and the quest straight up says not to let the undead know what you’re up to. We do not trust them.
---
who the fuck is chugging consumables in a 5man?
---
good for you then you value gold in the game more than the game, go play retail the numbers are bigger so you can feel like you have more
---
The main thing that helps with the anxiety portion is to simply care less about losing aggro and accept that it's part of classic. It's also more apparent because you don't have taunt. Druids and Warriors lose initial threat if dps play the exact same way they are with you, but they can taunt back and make it seem like nothing happened. You are the tank, that means people have to play around you, and not the other way around; just keep that in mind for yourself.
---
Pally tanks have 0 synergy with warrior and hunter dps, so nothing you can do there. Their aoes are high damage on 3-4 mobs and yours is just a dot. Warriors pretty much need to charge so that's just life. There's really no reason to bring warriors, but if you want to then just let them tank skull, since they get extra rage too, and focus on the rest of the mobs. Hunters aren't as bad overall since they can drop aggro if you want to multi-shot at the start of a pull. Ultimately, as long as the healer doesn't have threat on anything then you did the most basic and important part of your job.
---
As far as things you can do to increase your threat: Flurry Axe is amazing and will be night and day for your tanking capabilities. You can get a force reactive disk and use it at the start of pulls for some extra oomph with holy shield, then switch to your normal shield... but it's kinda overkill.   
---
It sounds like you are wearing a lot of warrior gear, but in 5mans damage and efficiency are more important than mitigation. The only mitigation gear even worth considering is deathbone, so don't bother with gear like stockade pauldrons or golem skull helm when you can just wear lightforge and have more mana to work with. Spell damage gear where you can get it; briarwood reed, shaman king chest, T2 helm are all strong and accessible options.  
---
Your rotation sounds fine, but defiantly open boss fights with max rank everything including consecrate, as the initial threat stage is the most important.
---
Not everyone likes world PvP. It's just a bunch of high levels griefing noobs because they got griefed when they were noobs. Like, if thats your thing cool, but I'm on a pve server because I dont need that kind of negativity in my life.
---
Ah yes, back when WoW didn’t get it’s writing from fanfic.net
---
Same with my guild, great bunch of people.
---
Oh i remember. I used my mom's account to get to arthas, then got inv with all of my alts on her save, kicked her each time so she keeps arthas alive and rince and repeat. 10-12x I think / week
---
If you're in a group with the enhance sham he should be twisting.
---
vanishes on his boat into the horizon...
---
I've been fighting that fight too, dude.  The most compelling argument you can make IMO is that, assuming roughly 8 days played to reach level 60 (Which is a very fair number.  Some obviously are faster, many are slower.), a person could have played for two hours *every single day since release* and still not be level 60.
---
If you get really good at baiting on the interrupts you can go a lot further with Holy 1v1's. Get a good Interrupt tracking addon, and then practice baiting out the interrupt and Spell locks.  Still holy pvp will always lack in the 1v1.  Another tip is to bait out different classes escape mechanics for Fear, and to also rotate fears and bubbles.  With Undead for example, I will usually start with fear, to bait on there escape, then bubble for sustain, try to bait out an interrupt/spell lock, survive for 30second and then fear again, this fear should be a full duration for most classes, heal up, MB, sheild when they come back, kite with SWP, bait another interrupt and GG.  The interrupt addon is key though b/c it lets you know when they used interrupts and tracks there CD, giving you a window of free casting.
---
not pick paladin and then not pick hunter have 2 60s and im bored af I guess i completed my goals for phase 1 though Cleared MC/Ony multiple times and have epic mount (atleast on hunter)
---
If you want a sable guild, look at warcraft logs and find the top guilds from your server. The more tryhard a guild is, the less likely it'll randomly implode, which makes sense when you think about it. People who care about the game a lot are less likely to randomly stop playing, or show up late to raid, or scuff MC badly enough to cause drama. Sadly these guys are also more toxic, which I think just comes with the territory. But if you're feeling disrespected, rolling a tank won't help. People shit on bad tanks just the same as bad dps.
---
When I joined my guild people talked shit because my dps was low. I improved my play/gear and nobody cared anymore. What people in these guilds care about is performance.
---
If you do enough dps, show up to raids on time, and aren't as asshole, you can find a spot on just about any guild, even as a rogue. My guild isn't recruiting rogues, but if someone who pulled their weight wanted in they'd probably get a shot.
---
This is all a bit 'serious', and you might enjoy the more casual side more. But as you've seen guilds without a bunch of momentum can easily blow up.
---
And in the next sentence said they’re going to be putting renewed focus on mobile and esports :(
---
You think skeram is bad? Come on Kirtonos I’ll show you the absolute nightmare for alliance.
---
Fishing in garrison gave you a small chance to get an item that would summon a boss. Looting the boss granted some currency, some fishing stuff like poles ans hats, chance at the 2 mounts and some other random stuff. 
---
Now since the multitag, people would form 40 man raids in garrisons and fish. When someone got the item, everyone got the loot. Loot item-&gt;summon-&gt;kill-&gt;loot rinse and repeat. Since there were 40 man in a raid, you would get a summon every other cast essentially, granting you huge chances on the mounts, one of which is a TCG, some not available otherwise.
---
Thats all i spam rly. Fight are short enough that with a pot and maybe a rune you can spam flash the whole fight. Ineficiencies only matter in longer fights.
---
I agree, and that's a good point. I still think it's valid to ask how much cash on hand someone has though, if you're trying to survey a population
---
That is _absolutely_ not true.
---
1) They introduced an isolated island for max level characters to play in. There is no longer a reason to visit the main world.
---
2) Flying mounts further killed the mainland by allowing you to essentially skip over any travel time / difficulty.
---
3) Heroics now introduce varying difficulty levels in dungeons. These Promoted elitist behavior and allowed the dev team to lazily churn out "extra" content to keep people busy with minimal effort.
---
4) Daily quests were introduced, cementing that your life in WoW is now nothing but job. Gotta log in every day or else you're missing out on money and reputation!
---
5) 40 man raids were removed, moving us more towards the streamlined experience we have today.
---
...and possibly a few more things I'm missing out on.
---
Overall, TBC is the very _definition_ of retail. Yes, it was a fun expansion for a lot of people. And for as much bad is in it, there was good too. But it is _not_ classic. At all.
---
So you are assuming that data is biased because it  clashes with your opinion? As far as I am concerned its loud minority complaining about things like dm early release.
---
Based on what data do you claim that majority of people are low level?
---
Blizzard fucked Skeram up with the last transfers where basically for every 10 transfers, 7 were alliance.
---
Now they're opening it again with no faction restrictions. They're so unbelievably incompetent.
---
No I understand 100%.
---
You think that wow is somehow different from the other games that run 200v200 battles flawlessly without lag. Those games are also running anti hack and checks aswell. 
---
So blizzard has a engine horribly optimized for the game were paying $15 a month for.
---
They can take that money and redesign the engine or completely reprogram it so it doesn't suck ass. With the subs from classic wow doubling their current subscription count, is venture to say they have more than enough capital from a 15 year old game with minimal development cost to get this fixed.
---
But no you are completely wrong that this is a hardware limitation, it's a bad design and programming issue. Which falls into blizzards court.
---
Cranite Vomir belt was my favorite
---
Will never happen
---
He gay
---
I've been looking fondly at Cata ever since MoP and WoD.
---
No, using your hearthstone to leave by yourself and not offer a portal is as bad.
---
If queues are going to be higher without layering as they literally just said it will, that means layering spreads out the strain on their resources and increases server capacity. The blue post directly contradicted what you're arguing.
---
It is a product of that, the modern fury warriors are geared very different than any warrior was in vanilla.
---
is there an updated list on all the PvP servers balance? or is it just from personal observation?
---
I remember [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dk6gx5/layering_does_not_affect_server_capacity/) post in particular.
---
How about we demand that blizzard keeps everyone happy, instead of shitting on anyone who doesn't play exactly the same way as you...
---
Thing is that everything past T2 doesn't have any resistances on it. The PvP gear doesn't have any resistances. Most classes simply don't have any resistance buffs. Rogues and warriors will likely be running 0 resistances. That's why I would think that 50+ spell pen is just too much.
---
It's more useful now, as you can actually hit 50 res to all by just running tier gear.
---
Yes, most speed records are held by alliance guilds but that is only because there are more alliance guilds on these private servers.  Horde are better for speed runs for MC and BWL and alliance are better for AQ40 and Naxx.  That is with wcb on alliance though.  Without wcb, alliance will definitely not have the best times.
---
I CANT TANK IF I DONT GET HIT BY THE ENEMIES
---
No, he said he had a couple guildies that said they would buy them. We all told him to not sell them but some people would think selling is better idea.
---
Hunters are one of the top DPS classes through molten core. You dont get to shit on us completely until phase 3
---
My vote is TBC
---
I loved the game the way it was all the way thru WotLK (minus dungeon finder). I would love to play it all again and actually do some endgame (which is why I wish they released phase 2 of Classic later - it’s going too fast for me, I have a job and a family...)
---
i thought high hit is always good despite racial. i have 9% atm, could replace an item for crit but i think the hit is better
---
YTD means year-to-date. I don't know about you but my moderately aggressive investment portfolio would be quite pleased with a 14% return in 11 months.
---
I ran with 7/31/13 when OT and felt like it was a good compromise.
---
Went for 2 points in Tactical Mastery, this enables stance dancing to get the crucial Intercepts and Mocking Blows (you'll use both these skills often when OT in MC, especially on trash pulls).
---
31 points into fury for Bloodthirst. When you can DPS you spam Bloodthirst and Whirlwind on CD, until Execute range. When tanking just spam Sunder and Revenge whenever it's up. If you have extra rage or a good threat lead, throw in Shield Blocks and Bloodthirst's.
---
Finally, get Improved Shield block and Last Stand from protection. You'll have 1 point left over, I threw it into Defiance, in prot, for a bit of extra threat in 5 man's.
---
Not him, but I think the general sentiment was because DM has so much really good loot, that it kind took some shine away from Strat/Scholo/UBRS before a lot of people had really had a chance to start farming *them*.
---
Wish i could upvote this more than once
---
I urge you to seek professional help. There's something not working right in your brain.
---
Fury tanking dungeons is not nearly as viable as fury tanking raids.
---
Block and extra armor makes a much larger impact when tanking 3+ mobs that don’t hit hard but hit fast.
---
And block makes much less of an impact on a boss like Onyxia which hits hard(ish) but attacks slow.
---
Ally of Heartseeker please lend all aid to Kirtonos. It is a 30-70 split. For the love of god help.
---
but biggest regret by far is transfering from a high populated Firemaw to a low/mid pop Bloodfang
---
Unfortunately this is one of those situations where the snowball effect is already rolling
---
What they *should* have done at the start was use server queues to keep live populations relatively balanced and closely managed free transfers so people aren't just fleeing their outnumbered faction
---
You seem to imply that no one knows how hard it is to reach rank 14 and/or that everyone's goal is to achieve that.
---
Personally, I'll be happy running WSGs, ABs and AVs with my pals, I don't really care about Ranks, although I'll certainly aim for at least Rank 8 on my Druid, for that sweet 4-piece bonus...
---
I won't stop PvPing once I reach that goal, although you're probably right that many other players probably will.
---
Definitely new servers to transfer to.  One of the worst parts of the original run was not getting the opportunity to clear certain content because it was made obsolete.  They should avoid that this time.
---
Not necessary. Neither is goblin since youre a warlock. Id suggest going herb/mining to help you make money easier.
---
How old are the classic boys?
---
When I see this topic come up I think about well what did they do back then? And why would they not do the same thing now? Lol
---
 Unless your saying you want 3 wow games. Retail, classic and tbc classic which imo doesnt sound good at all
---
Nah, if the druid wants it he can pay the winner. I'm not a charity that just gives away 500g to someone because they rolled a druid. If an epic BOE drops not only am I rolling need, im convincing everyone else to roll need.
---
What.  Wtf are you talking about?
---
It feels equally balanced, if not, slightly in favor of Alliance. I always play late at night, though, so I never see what it’s like during peak times.
---
Trash hunters ask for wisdom
---
unless you're a mage, then there's only the relaxed way =p
---
I have a brain.  Try it.
---
Okay then.
---
They don't wanna have a Smaug so close (?) to Orgrimmar
---
Yes and so did every patch ever (probably) so why would people assume this is any different?
---
but who was snipping tool
---
I'm a bis baby because i think healers shouldn't be rolling on a spell hit neck?
---
You realize your healing spells don't get resisted right?
---
Are you saying that tanks in Dire Maul North shouldn't completely ignore the Warlock mobs? My last tank seemed to think letting them free cast Banish, Immolate, etc was perfectly fine
---
I second this, I'm just a pre raid BiS hunter mainly and I am never below top 4 in MC and Ony I'm usually second or third
---
To me it seems obvious that the game is approachable in more than one way and that there are a lot of low-life losers who want everyone else to play it the same way they do.
---
Wrath was dildos and what made me quit the game. TBC &gt; wrath
---
If your PVP shadow, R1 SWP is very important for the 10% proc to stun
---
Still, the game is extremly popular and getting updated with new content, so they cant be ruining the game like people claim would happen with WoW.
---
2 hours in classic is finding the next flight master
---
5% will get you hit capped for main hand and yellow hits in pvp, 24% for offhand white hits
---
&gt; Giving the team a fresh start to re-imagine WoW with a Classic philosophy is such an opportunity both for Blizzard and the fans
---
This is my hope, but I don't trust the modern WoW team to not completely fuck it up.
---
I would settle for TBC talents and skill combined with new zones in Azeroth. Make new lvl cap 65 and start hading out talent point at 5 or keep lvl cap at 60 and start with talent points at 1.
---
Ohhhh dang!  I still have all charges!  Great tip thank you.  I am hoping to get the eye of shadow this weekend so when I do get the other eye I can rush over there asap lol
---
I went holy/disc all the way to 60. I respecced to shadow at lvl 40 to check it out but quickly respecced back. I preferred the life of being a dungeon healing god. You’ll make a lot of friends along the way.
---
I urge you to stop using sock-puppets... or at least be less fucking obvious about it.
---
You must be liberal with all the mental gymnastics you're trying to do LMFAO. Keep on shilling :)
---
This is awesome...I will look into it. Thank you!
---
I don't trust Blizzard to get anything right about Classic+ based on their current track run.
---
Also had a Cassandra’s grace drop in Maraudon and the 47 tank with Flurry Axe and the epic BoR shield won it :))
---
“It doesn’t work” - laughs in OS runescape
---
what was causing you to fail though? Some people may not have this. 
---
Holy water, and oil of immolation should be fine for most. Knowing where to conserve your mana, have regen and using your wand comes in handy.  Grats on getting it now go get it chanted and enjoy the power of the benediction.
---
&gt; this will be at like 40hrs/week status
---
oh, you sweet summer child
---
Lmao fuck off
---
I'd says it's more of me showing that it's always been the unpopular opinion. But since recent changes maybe things are changing?
---
So, I don't know where you play, but I can tell you this. If you are not on a RP or RP-PvP server, I would switch in a heartbeat.
---
Dude, you are clearly the salty one here lol
---
Let me ask you this.. Why a TBC with changes rather than an extension of classic?  what is to say that classic+ can't be the parts of TBC you want?  Why can't we add Karazhan, updated talents, etc to classic+ instead of releasing TBC? 
---
Not saying that's what I want but the counter could be made to your argument.  What are the parts of TBC you want?  Do you want Outland? Do you want level 70? Do you want 25 man raids? Or do you just not want flying / arenas? Much of TBC could be incorporated into classic+
---
what is this post even
---
Your point is, but meh gold, not really a winning argument
---
Arthas was the ultimate chad
---
Can you buy the Nightfall plans yet?
---
Because a warrior wouldnt have to spend that "plenty of time" to farm a rare drop that you may not see for dozens for dungeone runs if the fucking hunter would go look at a list where someone did all of the decision making for him and saw that he can get an actual Best in Slot trinket from a quest that starts in LBRS and ends in UBRS, and another trinket that he can buy from a book off the auction house for cheap and go into DM north and turn it in after 2 trash packs. 
---
That doesnt even account for the other trinkets that are much easier to farm than the HOJ
---
We had a pally that wanted the Azuresong Mageblade because it was technically an optional BIS item according to 1 list out of 4, but we told him that he wasn't getting it because it would be stupid to hand it to him over the 15 casters who would benefit a lot more when that blade is an actual best in slot item for them. 
---
If you are so casual you dont plan on raiding... mabye, but it doesnt excuse the absolute lazyness and shit attitude of someone who cant be bothered to google for 2 seconds and see a list of great options for them to use.
---
The lazy man's gold farming, profession cooldowns. Arcanite transmutes and making mooncloth. Usually 10g profit on the bars and 15-20g on the mooncloth. Also making a few raiding potions when the profit is right.
---
You are arguing multiple different points here tbh. Saying anything but arena would be a waste of time as a pvper is pretty silly.
---
Also, a fully t6 geared player is only losing to a player in blues if they do something horribly wrong. I mean, when t6 was current most arena players were using multiple t6 pieces. 
---
“This is how you play as a pvper after resilience” is where your post went wrong. You clearly aren’t a pvper in any respect, so I’m not sure why you fee you can comment so matter-of-fact on the subject.
---
Tbh you sound like the type of person I mentioned in my other post here; “raiding is the best and wearing raid gear should net you a kill every fight regardless of skill”. That’s mostly what arguments like yours boil down to, and honestly it’s still not far off rofl. Through the entirety of tbc high level arena players wore raid gear.
---
ur username is bad content
---
But probably not actually this, as computers have some unique challenges in creating anything close to 'truly random'. So who really knows what the actual odds are
---
It would be. A lot more bitching though because of the increased player count.
---
Nah it doesn't, that'd be your shitty reading comprehension playing a spook on you.
---
The Healer is OP. Lol
---
They should create new vanilla servers during that time. Vanilla should always be an option.
---
&gt;I think the chance of atleast 3 people rolling 100 is more what people are interested rather than exactly 3 people rolling 100.
---
exactly this.
---
He didnt get it for rolling first. He got it cauz he won the second "internal" roll
---
What we get by adhering to these social norms is a community, and there is a very high chance that when you're playing as x class that you won't have to roll against every party member on an item that is clearly best suited for you.  The benefit of having such a community is rather obvious, whether you're the selfish type or not - you benefit in the long term.
---
You sound like a competent player, any group that doesn't give the tank leader or assist should be a red flag.
---
Isn’t there a macro to make marking super easy? Just target and hit the hot key.
---
I never had a problem with the second half, but those white ghosts still terrify me.
---
It made raiding sets fairly unusable in PVP bc you would just get dunked in if anyone touched you
---
Is it worth not having a SW:P applied to your target though? In order to spam rank 1 you can't have a higher rank applied.
---
What's the difference between that and now? I probably have the most time clocked in BC out of any expansion, and I never once complained about flying. In classic if you dismount to try and kill someone, and they mount up and run away 100 percent faster than you, what are you realistically going to do? I'd think being 200 feet away from the person chasing you likely has the same effect as being 20 feet above them. But keep throwing flawed logic around like its candy, it's not making you look amy smarter.
---
And please read carefully! A warrior rolled need on inventor's focal sword because he saw the 1% crit. He didn't read that it is for spells. Luckily, the caster in our group already had one.
---
Why troll him by re-applying it? 
---
As for how to handle it, you could have just cast a different blessing on him after the group cast and it would have overwritten salv.
---
I got my feral tank buddy to put on thorns and stand at the cave entrance and just tank the skellies for the duration of the fight.
---
Cruel/quick, friend. Winged harpoon. I had no idea it would be so in demand. 299/40. I was told if it was 300/40 it would be worth much less because people would think it was duped. Some rich barb was incredibly happy.
---
You gotta anticipate the damage. Start casting when the tank is already has full health.
---
Could you be less specific?
---
I think if they do TBC+ the only way that makes sense is to do it like Jagex did OSRS and expand classic into TBC and then start adding features to turn it into TBC+ so that we end up with only retail and TBC+. That's really the only way I see to get around the issue of splitting the community.
---
Kinda sucks when you wanna level a new profession and go back to "starter zones" where normal mobs won't bother you from mining or something. But now you agro everything there still
---
In a BG, a dwarf rogue with 0 resistance on gear will open up on you. He will have 52 resistance.
---
Druid buffed him with MOTW for 27 resistances. His racial gives him 10. His frost reflector, 15.
---
Now you tell me. Is 50 penetration useful against this guy or not?
---
We don't play in a vacuum... And you don't need everyone you meet to have resistance to make this better. 1 in 4 and it will still be better. Just because of how massive of a difference it is. And it won't be 1 in 4. Everyone who's good will have some resists while engaging your mage.
---
I've been actually reading the quest text this time around and the Horde really isn't that bloodthirsty and Thrall preaches the importance of accepting those who are different than yourself.
---
&gt; And i think a lot of people would do the same.
---
A lot sure would, but then again, if private Vanilla servers were so popular, 15 years after the original release, why should we assume that Classic won't remain somewhat popular, even if they decide to release TBC?
---
&gt; And then blizzard would just think that i and all those people prefer TBC which would be wrong.
---
Exactly, if Blizzard allows people to just transfer or copy their level 60 to TBC servers, it will hurt Classic a lot more than it would if they made players who really wanted to play TBC so bad actually have to start new characters from scratch.
---
All that being said, I like the idea of "Classic+" a lot more than TBC. I've already mentioned a "Phase 7" consisting of Arenas and Karazhan a few times in the past, which I think would be a better direction to take, for the sake of Classic's longevity and popularity, than it would to launch TBC servers and to allow Classic characters to be transferred or copied there.
---
Thats why you join a guild with scheduled raids 👏
---
Scholo also takes longer for many pugs. I wonder what the gph would be for both, but with 1 orb reserved the rare probably isn’t too different with less time spent.
---
Also this
---
Can I be your friend who plays on a server by himself and is only just reaching level 30 tonight if his kids behave?
---
do the original devs get residuals?
---
Yeah had a hunter keep trying to steal mine so I finally just killed it instead of trying to tame
---
OP clearly doesn't understand how much work is required to get things like this fixed in a company as large and global as blizzard
---
Improved talent trees... do not require TBC content at all to be implemented.
---
Blood elves ruined (yes, ruined) the Classic idea of the Horde, and Draenei were based on one of most blatant retcons in the history of WoW. Not to mention that Draenei lore with their spaceships until this day works only when ignored. 
---
Arena pvp was interesting only because people were stuck on their mains from Vanilla, and thus needed to improvise to create semi-viable comps. Today everybody will go for cookie-cutter comps from day 1. It won't ben fun, it will be just a worse version of retail. 
---
Flying controversy doesn't even need elaboration. 
---
Finally, TBC made all Classic content irrelevant. It effectively SHRINKED the game to 1 alien continent. 
---
WoW went to hell mostly because devs built upon features of TBC.
---
I think in BC it got pushed up again higher than 16 until they were able to restructure how debuffs worked making it unlimited. It was always a technology issue and not a balance one. This is a #nochange I think we didn't need. 🤷‍♂️
---
I just thought having a good spellhit gear might come in handy with pickpocket gold farms
---
Please follow your own advice.
---
Classic is generally returning players who have no interest in retail, not new players, myself included. Some are new mainly because they started post vanilla. It's not about new players. It's about switching the current subs to a less profitable model. A record increase in subs is just the result of pent up demand from people who have already been waiting for classic. Not new wow players
---
I think tbc will be released as well. It's easy money. My point remains the same that they want you playing retail, not classic even if the server load is cheaper to maintain and all of the codebase is already established
---
i heard hit % doesnt mean anything in pvp or am i wrong?
---
Entropy proves this wrong.  Eventually the entire universe will run out of energy, and nothing can be done about it.
---
Hey, you're the one that said *any*.
---
You can always start a go fund me to buy wow gold for a wardens staff. Oh wait, no one would donate money to you for something as silly as that. Why would you expect me to do the same in game for a pug?
---
It’s a guardian not a non combat pet
---
You can download an addon called MarkMe that puts a moveable bar on your screen with pictures for each icon and you just target the mob and press the icon and it marks them. It makes leading groups 100x easier and saves on buttons on your bar.
---
Is that something you could open a ticket for and maybe a GM could switch the items for you?
---
never said anything about my gold. My argument is I don't know you why would i give you something worth that amount of gold, something I can potentially trade for an item? I don't owe you a thing and I did the same amount of work as you to see the item drop. It's not on the loot table, it should be rolled for the entire group since it is bind on equip. I don't need a winning argument, when the majority agrees with me the boe = need.  You haven't changed my mind.
---
This is not how you gain acceptance, friend
---
&gt;The game has never ever gained this many subs in a quarter. If its worth it to spend money in retail, its absolutly worth it to use it on classic.
---
Would those people buy expansion packs though? Thats the issue. I think those numbers would get them to bring other old versions of the game.
---
I don't feel like you actually read anything past my first sentence.
---
I have been making Mooncloth regularly, but you know that's 15g every four days.
---
Wtf is Mighting hunters?  Take their pally license.  Wisdom or Salv for hunters, might for the pets.
---
he went on to explain what?  i think you forgot to include the entire point of your story
---
It's needed for pvp, just not as much as pve
---
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
---
never has that issue might be a us server issue. Are you in the US?
---
30 33 and 27
---
Smartphones are great, a second step to transhumanism. Smartphone games are not.
---
Youncan get away with prebis in BWL, but AQ will need BWL gear unless you're getting carried.
---
Good news, though. Everyone will be running everything every week, so it will he easy to find a guild still running MC and BWL every week even in phase 6.
---
Because the horde refuse to transfer. You expected the alliance to stay in the same unbalanced situation the horde have avoided putting themselves into despite the possibility it would bring balance. The horde have non stop posted heartseeker would be dead since day one despite watching a huge alliance transfer population. Instead of transferring themselves to form a new server, they decided to stay and enjoy the imbalance.  The horde need to organize a large transfer, just like the alliance on skeram did, and take a leap of faith that it will work out, rather than sit on horde dominant servers and complain its blizzards fault. It's the hordes fault for not moving just as much as the alliance for doing so and for blizzard allowing it.
---
Exactly.  If they simply continue with TBC, I'd essentially be done with the game (wasn't a huge fan of that expansion).  Classic+ would keep me interested, and invested.  New dungeons, new raids, new offspec gear.
---
I think that they need to find a place for micro-transactions in Classic+ to keep the developer team paid and happy.  Small things, like appearance changes, paid realm transfers, etc.
---
&gt;  DAILY QUESTS
---
FUCK. THAT. I rather have nothing to do than to feel obliged to do something.
---
Piggybacking off this, strictly for PvP and using Broken Tooth: would Bite, Claw, Dash, Prowl be the optimal choices? Thinking in terms of BGs down the road, I would assume Growl then becomes useless.
---
&gt;I wanna know what world you live in where a week starts on a Tuesday. 
---
Literally the World of Warcraft bud.
---
This is probably the best path forward, but they should also release fresh vanilla / TBC servers on a regular schedule that have transfer restrictions for a certain about of time ~3-6 months.
---
You’re pretty late to this topic. Do you just sift through the replies to old threads looking for stupid shit to say to people who weren’t talking to you?
---
A Hunter once told me that Kings yielded the bigger damage in the stat screen. Then later another one preferred Might.
---
Can someone clarify this?
---
Theres some catch up mechanics dont worry
---
Ironforge gang
---
Even with pseudorandom it still is really random. The randomness factor can be minimized if the random function is known and then is tampered with. But we can't do that unless we have access to the server software.
---
That's coming in Classic+
---
hmmm umm, well you dont look great here. I've been whispered to heal, and I'll ask for 10-20g, all unneeded drops, or first orb. Usually I ask for 5-10g and all drops. People usually accept not an issue. But going out of your way to whisper him asking for all orbs is ridiculous, you sound like a child, especially with the shadowlands comments and calling him worthless because he tanks in a guild.
---
can’t they just FD + drink in that case?
---
Also gave all classes selfheals that ruined pvp in my opinion.
---
Cata was an amazing expansion, don't sleep on it.
---
By far the best talent tree design, Class design overall was amazing and still focused on class over spec, most balanced PvP the game ever saw (specifically Season 10), 2/3 raid tiers were AMAZING with the third not being THAT bad.
---
I would play the living shit out of a Cata server, would MUCH prefer it to Classic lol...(I have been having tons of fun with Classic though).
---
God bless a pocket healer.
---
Congrats, Dire Maul was released early. I'm talking about phase 2, though, which looks to be on pace with the original vanilla release. 
---
Vanilla wow gap from launch to 1.3 -&gt; 105ish days
---
Classic wow gap from launch to world bosses/honor -&gt; 100 days (assuming a 5 december release date, which looks to be early.)
---
Yup, you're 100% right that dire maul and only dire maul was released early. But to use that as an example of how they're "rushing to release content earlier" is, to me, obviously stupid. 
---
Phase 2 is looking to be dead-on with tracking the original release of patch 1.3 
---
"Check the dates if you're gonna start talking shit. Ty" Amazing, classic reddit reply. "Hey, I picked out the one part of this that proves me right, and you better believe I'm gonna be smug about it" 
---
Giving me nostalgia for 2005 only difference is we were fucking kids back then....
---
But why would you do that when enhancement shamans and their stupidly high windfury proc rates exist?
---
Yes, read what I'm saying. The point of them is not for the hardware side of things because they should be on the same physical hardware. But they're saying it will cause increased queues, so who knows what they've done.
---
Yeah.  I went combat rogue out of personal theory crafting. in Vanilla was pretty much the only combat sword rogue out of the top 20 guild across both horde &amp; alliance on my server.  People thought I was stupid and dumb.
---
But my guild was mind blown by my unbelievable dps.  Word got out and slowly more and more rogues would send me whispers for advice on making the switch.
---
Eventually about the end of BWL it became common knowledge combat sword was OP for raiding.  Everyone had one or more in their raid.
---
I think you just changed my life. 
---
Can’t believe I didn’t think of that hahaha
---
Twas but a scratch
---
Start here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dtdbw1/unpopular_opinion_instead_of_pushing_phases/f6we4ex
---
Probably true. I just hope that a little piece of the magic of vanilla could be reignited in retail. 
---
I am not sure how shadowlands is gone be, but I must admit that I felt good watching it. I am looking forward to it. There are aspects of retail I like, but yes.....it’s far from what wow used to be.
---
Zugzug
---
Cataclysm at its core was an amazing idea. I loved a lot of it, and only stopped playing halfway through the first tier because I burned myself out going 4 nights a week in high school with a bad guild. What was bad about Cata was none of the old world things. It was the fracturing of class identity into specs, the introduction of LFR, and the lack of content/terribly implemented dragonsoul.
---
Dunno. I quit after Nax in WOTLK. I was still using raid gear for arenas then though.
---
I’m just counting on classic +
---
No. I don't care about world pvp and I don't want the rest of the content to be delayed because of it.
---
Cata has flying mounts, lfr and lfg.  If those get added to classic it no longer is classic.
---
Because if she can do that crap to the Alliance, there's little stopping her from also doing the same to the Horde.
---
Ok makes even more sense you hate pvp and esport, but that is ok, seriously what class do you play?
---
Wait, were you the skinner, or was the druid the skinner?
---
The loot from skinning should almost always go to the skinner, as they took the time to hit 300 and get the dagger for +10 skinning.
---
You are right about that.
---
Classic pvp is kind of wack, it's more an indicator of who has more time to commit to grinding vs skill. Also classes balance is wack and there aren't even BGs out yet.
---
TBC and beyond was a lot better for pvp in terms of skill based ranking with arenas and then eventually RBGs
---
Hijacking your comment for the play to win mentality which I love. The only downfall of doing classic+ is swinging and missing. They know they will have at least a solid audience for BC. But here’s where I think they overestimate things. Classic is doing great because it’s fresh again. It’s what people want. But that will deteriorate over time. Once it’s no longer new people will stop playing. BC will be “new” but the deterioration will happen faster than it will in classic. The 2nd part is the optimization game. People saw it off release in classic. I don’t think it’s good for WoW to keep releasing an already beaten game. They should take what they have learned from the success of BC and wotlk and implement things that people like in classic+. We know making continents and content that requires flying starts to hurt the game down the line. We know dungeon queues hurt the game. Let’s not go down the same path. There’s a real shot at making the best MMO again. You don’t get that opportunity all the time.
---
And it all sucks.
---
The only reason I didn't totally hate myself leveling in classic is because I could spam dungeons.
---
I've cleared all content as a wonky full resto/enh 1sec ghost wolf spec and I've cleared all content as 30/0/21 and DMW gives me trouble even as deep resto with 400+ healing. Some parts are just rough.
---
We aren’t talking about classic, we are talking about private servers, you derelict.
---
.3 repeating of course.
---
It's fascinating how, in cinema, and TV we are constantly(these days, anyway) inundated with hero, or heroes who save the day, and are the reason for the story. Or at the minimum, the story revolves around them to a very large degree. Sure there exist the usual and typical tale of the underdog who eventually wins over the respect of X group and saves the day. A hero, all the same in the end to be admired and worshiped.
---
But here we enter this world where we're a nobody, or at best just someone who helped advance certain events along. And even there are cases where sure you did do something, but in the end on the larger scale of things, you're just a grain of sand on the beach. Endless NPCs call you inconsequential and treat you no better than an errand boy.
---
And we love it.
---
Choosing burritos was appropriate because this is a shit analogy.
---
Your analogy might work if **all** servers were heavily Horde biased, but there are PvP servers that have too many Alliance. Heartseeker is the one I'm most familiar with because it's where most of our Alliance went.
---
On the 14th they'll reopen transfers from Skeram (mostly Horde) to Heartseeker, which is fucking stupid because it just means more Alliance will flee and the balance on **both** servers will get worse.
---
I think worgen don't have pockets though, at least the ones in duskwood don't
---
That's cool but its 2019 and I can get playable lag free community servers for free. Im not gonna keep paying blizzard for this shit show
---
this is definitely once of the better launchers in terms of looks I grabbed it a few days ago it's awesome.
---
The best warrior parses are mostly blues.  The gear threshhold to be better isnt really that high and its only going to get worse from here.
---
The decline began with ToC
---
Yeah, no.
---
She will :-) Australia is our home. She just needs to focus on making sure her family are taken care of in the US. I'm going adjust work so that we can play together as best we can :-). The officers in my guild have been amazing in taking on extra duties so I can focus on RL - for that I am so fortunate :-).
---
It is good for off-hand hit rate but there may be better pieces of gear that would sim higher
---
At level 60 you generally stop questing and start exclusively running raids/dungeons and pvp. I would drop growl at this point and replace it with prowl, makes it so you don't have to dismiss your pet and it won't ninja pull based on positioning. For leveling Dash bite claw growl.
---
Classic was great for nostalgia and the difference in community was great at the start!
---
But for someone with a job, wife, 2 kids and lots of other hobbies its just too slow to advance for me, so switched back to Retail for the QoL and speed of leveling. 
---
Was fun while it lasted - wonder how many others dropped out after a month or so?
---

Hah, science will have sorted that eventually.
---
Flat Earthers don't believe in Australia so that means I don't exist :o
---
Yea just telling you what a warrior said in zf, with growl off he still couldn’t hold aggro over pets auto attacks so he requested cower
---
It's not actually classic unless you fall through the world
---
yeah. for example flameguard gauntlets and the flamewalker legs from MC.
---
Oh great! So it isnt indefinitely! Good to hear and again good luck!
---
I know where to start. What I saw was someone come in super angry that anyone dared to not want dire maul released early, along with making shit up nobody said. Then using "the game didnt literally explode the day it was released" to disprove those made up arguments. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dtdbw1/unpopular_opinion_instead_of_pushing_phases/f6wmy14/
---
Going back to “vanilla continent” was good. Then it was destroyed since we could bypass anything with our flying mounts :(
---
Skeram doing our part as well
---
Thanks friend. Thanks :-).
---
Once you have epic mount and decent pre raid gear, it can feel like there is little to nothing to do unless you wanna farm minor upgrade runs for hours.
---
Cataclysm was not Classic+.  Classic+ implies adding to existing content.  Cataclysm literally changed everything, including all the zones.
---
Cataclysm was built upon TBC/WOTLK design. Blizzard tried return the game to its original state using wotlk mechanics.
---
This is better than the Core Marks rifle, and you can get it from running Strat live:  
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13380/willeys-portable-howitzer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13380/willeys-portable-howitzer)
---
You want the slower weapon because it hits harder so when you use multi or aimed shot you get the most damage per mana/time.
---
Horde imbalance on release PVP servers like Stalagg and Skeram are what caused this. You snowballed it by continuing to roll there and drove the Alliance out. You have nobody to blame but yourselves.
---
Of course we would run to Heartseeker, why would we want to be completely miserable in the world?
---
They're about to drop the hottest album of 2019
---
How much rage do you get for a parry again 🤣
---
It will have good raids and M+ (can't speak for PvP as I don't play it) and the rest of the game will be utter dogshit. I guarantee it
---
They can but turns out the damage lost from autoshot is more than the damage gained from having mana.
---
With the exception of fights where you're forced to not deal damage anyway, but those are rare.
---
I personally like the number pad
---
Layering was the shit
---
Way too soon.
---
&gt; What I think most people want, is for TBC servers to be new servers, and separate from classic. That way classic wow stays alive
---
People always overlook the whole reason private servers have existed and what drove blizzard to make classic in the first place.
---
NO ONE WANTS TO SIT ON A 2 YEAR OLD SERVER WITH NO NEW CONTENT.
---
Once Blizzard makes a TBC server, it doesn't matter if you allow character copies, classic realms will die because there is no incentive to play them longterm in Phase 6.
---
Guess what happens then?  If blizzard doesn't provide _FRESH_, then pservers will simply resurrect the "fresh" cycle that has been going on for years prior.
---
we'll see how it goes :)
---
I asked because I legitimately didn't realize that he was also here posting comments at the same time. Then I looked and realized who you were talking about. Honestly man... I was just hoping to see you come around and admit you were wrong. I really can't believe you are still making shit up and sticking so hard to it.
---
Are you talking about mage vs warrior matchup in classic or tbc? If tbc yes the matchup is fun as hell, in classic, if the mage know what he's doing you won't be able to win as a human.
---
&gt;I much rather they do Classic+ and here's why.
---
&gt;Classic+ can be it's own WoW franchise!
---
Yea, but... it would be better to TBC+ rather than Classic+. I do enjoy classic, but the balance of it is utter shit for actual long term play. I get it, no changes blah blah blah
---
But...
---
Class balance in classic is utter shit. There is no arena. Many of the most iconic abilities actually came in BC. 
---
Classic+ would literally just be implementing BC anyway.
---
Transmogrification was the most popular thing they ever added.
---
It’s good with a dedicated group. Doing it solo and in small amounts means your efficiency falls off a cliff in travel time getting to the instance, waiting for everyone to get there, getting another healer after your’s internet dies etc etc. Solo questing with opportunistic dungeons will be much much faster.
---
Here's windfury totem instead
---
You’re not really doing anything but looking like a pussy
---
A decent amount because it decreases your time until your next swing via the parry haste mechanic
---
I live bear chicago
---
So Blizzard got the actual numbers while private servers based theirs on numbers people came up with by watching old videos?
---
damn wtf that drop rate is horrendous....either way I will be trying this lo. Thanks.
---
what are you talking about? they have 6 years of content in the original trilogy and then they can do classic + it's smart business 
---
just cous u want classic+ doesn't mean a lot of people don't want tbc and wrath. Do you really trust blizz to make Classic +? they haven't made a good expansion in years
---
I don’t want some stupid gnome inspecting me. Hellz no!
---
that is warriors in a nut shell from start to finish from vanilla to BfA. we got no gear we shit we got some gear we gods now!
---
normally blizzards "fix" warriors has been to just nerf us every patch or make us worthless at the start. then ofc they had the good idea of giving us one tool that is no tied to gear in WoD and we would have been god from start to finish but ofc warriors is always the class that get the heel turn nerfs as quickly as something is even close to being too good.
---
Bm spec + fast attack speed will do that sometimes.
---
The spec is good but I do want to add that you can farm with flamestrike/CoC as any spec. So don't respec unless you're planning on farming ZF for a long time.

You dun lost ya damn mind!
---
I use classicAuraDurations to show all debuffs
---
Sorry by indefinitely, I just meant we have no idea when she can book the return flight.
---
It’s been tough on stalagg to find people for SM, ZF, and Mara
---
I've *been* winning it as human.
---
Both classic and tbc.
---
Yeah but even after waiting a few seconds, warriors will lose to snap-aggro. I think hunters and warriors need to petition Blizzard.
---
and thank you Maze :-)
---
Why are there so many recent threads about Warlocks?
---
U sound triggered
---
They are terrible things I agree. But isn't the best solution to release Cataclysm without these things. Blizzard could not remove them back them.
---
If you're like me and can easily get sidetracked while doing quests, go with dungeon leveling.    
---
When people tell you that leveling via questing is faster, it assumes that you will not be getting sidetracked and you will follow the most efficient questing steps possible.  As we know though, it's very easy to get lost, die multiple times on a single quest or get sidetracked and do stuff like mining/herbing.  So if you're a min/max god and you know the quests well, go with questing.  But if you don't want to get sidetracked and want to stay focused on leveling, dungeons are a great alternative.
---
I liked dailies when they had a cap of 25. When they removed the cap i felt required to do every single daily and that pissed me off.
---
Classic through wrath fledges out the warcraft story.. the games feel synced together and all feel like an mmo rpg.. they can build an esports seen with tbc arena. Go make your own pserver if you just want modified classic.
---
You can also give tanks freedom which will overwrite their salv. Or bop but they may get more annoyed with that.
---
Alchemists?
---
Salvation for everyone. I don’t trust any of you heathen dps
---
people want more content on top of classic that is not how i would go about things i would be more about filling pot hole like alliance questing experience, retri paladins, certain quest items, racial balancing and retuning boss fights (making raids 25-man would be a totally okey thing for me) oh and "fix" trash epics like vendorstrike to be "hey it might be trash but it beats my dungeon blue"
---
there tons of more minor things like AoE looting, slam not having spell pushback.
---
BoP are need greed standard as you said, stop swaying from that, thats established and a mute point.
---
Greens are generally greeded cuz noone cares (1-4g a piece) BoE's that are bis for a class are need by everyone. Because of the potential they have for resale, gear trading or use. The biggest difference is these are tradeable between players thus they are sought after. I don't care about a piece that will net me 3-4 gold, but a piece that will get me 2x freezing bands, or some other pieces I can fill in lacking slots, absolutely it removes hours of farming.  I'm sorry you don't understand. But that's the way it is. If you don't like it run your own groups with your own loot rules.  As I have said before god speed.
---
Interesting, thanks for the info.
---
Greater Blessing versions of each last 3x as long and apply to every member of that class in your raid. Put Greater Blessing of Salvation on one Warrior, *every* warrior gets it. Arms and fury warriors absolutely need the threat reduction, and there's usually more of those than tanks, so it's faster and easier to greater salv all of them then have the tanks cancel it for regular versions of something else.
---
Surprised more people like the DM and Earlyish phase 2
---
Im still a lowie, and a noob. 
---
So i maxed out the talent that gets me mana reg after i kill smth, and the wand dmg talent. Now.. im on a pvp server, but i want to heal some dungeons as i level up - can someone recommend me a specc in which i can heal dungeons and still be a danger in open pvp? Or is this impossible?
---
Is today opposite day? Did I miss the memo again?
---
Is it even possible to be any more WRONG this?
---
You’re right, if you’re paying for a video game you have nothing to do in, you’re pissing away money. And that is entirely your fault, and Blizz should not be expediting updates just so your dumb ass isn’t pissing away money.
---
It’s almost as if you have the ability to unsub...
---
Also - you have *nothing* else do to? In 2.5 months you have completed *all* of the content P1 has to offer? That is extreme levels of basement dwelling. No reasonable person would be expected to keep up with that pace.
---
I don’t care how much you play, I only care when you start demanding the game be updated to keep up with your lack of a life.
---
I know, I was snarkily replying to the "what world you live in where a week starts on a tuesday" with the world of warcraft where for 15 years my week has started on a tuesday.
---
you're hopeless. good luck with your life. I'm blocking you now.
---
The two of us will be 100% fine, I just don't know when I'll see her next and it's getting to me a bit at this second hence staying away and on Reddit :-(. ANYWAY thank you for the kind words, and I hope the RNG gods are in your favour going forward!
---
Thunderbrew's a helluva drink.
---
Lol this is going to be the nail in the coffin for stalagg
---
You realize teleports and portals use different reagents right?
---
As far as I remember, there were only 10 dailies you COULD do. Like, a literal 10-per-day cap.
---
I remember doing them most days and it took under an hour each time.
---
Are you trying to say that Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker is not a hunter weapon?
---
In vanilla i farmed 300+ times for this item. First time i solod mara as a 57 priest in classic it dropped. Can confirm it exists and can confirm it is one hell of a weapon. There is no internal cd, and can proc multiple times off of an aoe, and happens to proc off of strange spells such as mind soothe and mind vision (though i think there is a limit to how far away from yourself it will proc). Also the dmg from the proc stacks with +shadow dmg. Wish you the best of luck good sir!
---
Holy shit...what an arrogant dumbass.  Has no idea what he's talking about lol
---
...will you make me Chicken Kiev while I grind Wintersaber? :-P :-D
---
Great reference
---
No mage should be using fireball, in current content half the mobs are immune to fire damage meaning you should prioritize frost damage. 
---
And because of that prioritization your frostbolt will do more damage than fireball even on mobs that are not immune.
---
&gt; Just like there are many people who will show up for TBC and didn't show up for Classic.
---
I *really* doubt that. The group of people who love BC but think Vanilla isn't worth playing is small.
---
TBC. I think that's where my friends and I had the most fun.
---
But what about if the BC servers run in parallel with Classic? You can choose when you want to bump your character over to BC? That way, people that want to stay in classic can stay in classic.
---
Classic plus !!!! Let’s do naxrammas worth it
---
I've been preraid bis for a month now. I've replaced some of it with mc gear already. It's not like I'm rolling on bop pieces for other classes. But BoE epics fall under a different set of rules. You'd be an utter fool if you passed 500-1000g to some random pug.
---
That’s a good idea actually
---
Still, that doesnt change the potential for the roll.
---
Divide by 3!2!/5! = 1/10
---
I think
---
Maybe 😀
---
I mean at the same time I’m being asked as a rogue to open up on targets with 300 health, when 2 aoe people are in group and that’s 3 hits from blizzard. So using our brains is a two way street. The tank doesn’t need agro on those mobs and needs to open up with the rogue on the main target. Mixing in feints as a rogue is important too.
---
I could probably find some Ukrainian chicken somewhere on the internet, yea
---
Well that's your perspective. Rn in my server you cannot turn in any quests at the keep because the ony attunement is constantly busy. Has been all week.
---
Ah good point, I forgot you guys exist.
---
The way he phrased it
---
"think about wow classic it is a major expansion coming into that universe in an off year"
---
makes it sound likes hes already implying that there is content coming down the pipeline ready rather than they need to do the unbelievably difficult task of constructing an entirely new content expansion for the universe. 
---
they see wow classic as delivering expansion level content during offyears when they are developing retail wow (or at least that is my take on it)
---
If everywhere you go smells like shit, you should check under your own shoe.
---
I did the same thing with 5 in wands and 5 in spirit tap and the rest into holy. I run with a couple friends so we have a tank and are able to get insta groups for dungeons. All depends on what you plan to do to lvl.
---
I hated belves (and paladins for that matter) coming to the Horde. I still refuse to play one on my retail characters, even though it's a DPS increase for my DK. I prefer Classic+, but Blizzard is probably going to take the path of least resistance.
---
&gt; Is it really the horde's fault?
---
Yeah. It is. When their world was dying they left it and came to ours. They can simply repeat that step.
---
I mean that's not what I meant but I'm definitely onboard to try new things.
---
These transfers aren't about balance,  they are about queue times. They've said it since the beginning that the servers being offered xfers are going to experience extended queue times when the layers are dropped.  People who can't play on a nightly basis because of a queue will quit 10x faster than those who can't find an opposing faction player to kill.   
---
At the end of the day, those who complain about the imbalance while sitting on a server that offers free transfers only have themselves to blame. If enough of the horde would have just transferred when they were offered, it wouldn't be like this.  They refused, claiming dead servers, alliance imbalance, and shit-talking every alliance player for doing so. Now you'd rather force those 10% alliance players that stayed, to stay further on a queue timed server, being completely outnumbered and farmed as well as those without a guild scouring for a group everynight just so you don't have to do what is necessary and move.  So yes, it is partially the horde's fault.
---
Who cares? If you have two games and one is doing better, why care about it? Runescape is the same. The retail version you can pretty much buy everything, gear, lvls, money, you name it. There are a bunch of people who love that game and spend alot irl money on it. Then there are people who prefer the old school game. They don't spend irl money on it, besides membership.
---
Goes for alot of games out there. Sometimes the old or original version is just the best that was ever created.
---
I wonder how many of people complaining picked horde just to be on winning team and refuse to play as alliance unless it has has an overwhelming advantage
---
&gt; Because of the potential they have for resale,
---
this is the definition of greed though that is my point, it you are needing on it to sell it or trade it you don't need that item it is purely for greed, i get that all the others you greed as they are not worth the same but it is still Greed that you want the item for no matter how you sell it to yourself to make you believe that it's not a ninja move to need on something to sell it that's exactly what it is
---
(alliance exists)
---
Oh yea. The "goodbye" routine.
---
I'm sure I'll hear from you again. :)
---
Fury can work in PvP, I did it for a good chunk of vanilla. It has many 1v1 matchups where it is better than arms - Arms becomes invaluable in any group PvP involving healers, though.
---
In PvE, Arms DPS is a bit of a joke, on par with something like a ret paladin.
---
If you want to do organized PvP, arms. PvP in general, either works. PvE, fury or prot.
---
Possibly I pugged a lot hit 50 pretty quickly then quit but at that level it was just a air fest. Also was a pretty wicked learning curve from retail for most who didn't even really know what was threat or if they did didn't care
---
Even people I ran with consistently still fucked around Because they knew I could hold threat
---
Had to explain to many a tank what stance dancing was.
---
But everyone expreinces things differently so to each their own.
---
Fat lootz.
---
Those are female ogres
---
I mean.. Warlocks doing dots and fear *is* the way they have to level if they don't go deep into Affliction and set up a drain tanking build. The void walker is utter trash and totally incapable of holding threat even on those dots, so the *intended* leveling style is inherently broken.
---
By all means you do you but if I was 2 manning dungons with a friend I'd probably split my profits from gathering professions.
---
Can we have TBC+ please? Bring out TBC and then go be free to do whatever, fuck the panda shit!
---
I've been tanking successfully as 30/21 (healing is my main role) and just picked up Quel Serar. Good thoughts on picking up Briarwood Reed and other pieces. I had not considered those when looking for the finishing touches to tank set. Thanks for this!
---
This. So the probability would be the probability of three random numbers out of five being 0.995 or greater.
---
p = (.005)(.005)(.005)(.995)(.995) = .000000123753125, or .000012%
---
At least I think that's how it's done. Been a while since I've done some probability analyses.
---
He got it on his first cast so respectively he had a 100% chance to get it.
---
*laughs in TBC prot pally* &gt;!for ten seconds, then I go OOM from not getting heals because I didn't take any damage!&lt;
---
I'll never forget tanking Kara in a dress.

Really? You can play a few hours a week and do nothing but smack board and you'll eventually be 60, no clue necessary.

I forgot Rogues couldn’t learn/equip axes until WotLK and was getting visibly frustrated at this until I remembered I never played my roflsword-Axe build with Flurry Axes until WotLK.

But nah, my wife and I played rust prior to WoW... Which was her getting shot at by someone, screaming out for me to help her and doing my best to save her :P. So WoW is a much more tranquil game for married folk like us. :P
---
Nice.
---
Of course, and I have that. The problem there is there are 2 raids which reset every 5 and 7 days. I enjoy doing 5 man dungeons quite a bit, especially for gold generation, and my point is that I can very clearly see a population frequency decline on the server I'm on in relation to how easy it was to form those groups weeks ago compared to today. I see the same thing stated all over this Subreddit as well.
---
Perfect for me, getting tired of pvp on kromcrush and cant transfer pve. Might as well
---
Am I a bad person for always intentionally buffing guildies with the wrong buff, ie: Might on Mages
---
At least theres finally a statement saying "WHEN LAYERS ARE REMOVED YOU WILL EXPERIENCE HIGHER QUEUES AGAIN"
---
So all those fucking idiots on this sub saying bUt LaYeRs DoNt AfFeCt PoPuLaTiOn can shut the fuck up.
---
&gt;catch up
---
Funny you mention catching up, what every single patch has in mechanics, allowing people to try to catch up and do content. Specifically though, it means low M+ keys and LFR. Unless this casual player with scarce time every week seeks out a Mythic raiding guild in the middle of an expansion, tries to find the gear each week to make them relevant, and grinds their HoA to unlock the traits they need on armor pieces they don't have yet, then they are NOT Mythic raiding.
---
Without a solid support system like a guild (not one that just invites guildless players from Org/Dalaran with scripts), I don't see a casual player being able to level up in a week to do Heroic raiding content. No way in hell, let alone Mythics, which still require the gear and the availability of a guild that gives a shit.
---
They did exactly that. There was plenty of data a week in and there are some 50% servers. It's on them.
---
I have three questions regarding to being a healer in the upcoming honor release:
---
1) What is the recommended talent for doing BOTH the PvP and raiding content? FYI, this is what I'm currently using for raiding https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5012301305001-025051031300055
---
2) For PvP, how should you rotate your spells? Would it be different from raiding? Also what should I be casting at the enemies? 
---
3) If I take up power infusion, how should I use this in PvP? 
---
Thank you and I appreciate your help.
---
Interestingly, my least favorite part of BC was the arenas (and, specifically, how they were required to get good pvp gear), which you didn't mention.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that there are many issues people had with BC, but not everyone had the same set of complaints.
---
I mean, you'd have to get an incredible dagger for it to be better than swords. It's much easier to just Shadow Strike and keep Slice &amp; Dice up, and nine times out of ten you'll get more mileage out of that while levelling, since you'll only ever be behind a mob while in stealth.
---
It helps increase the rate of skill increases. Maybe it'll help him git gud.
---
I use the WoWhead warrior tanking guide right now. It just feels a little vague on when to switch to fury prot. 
---
I'm also still using a sword and board so survivability is fine. The rogue in my group is slowly catching up to my threat generation in defensive stance but that's really only when he gets lucky with crits and sword spec procs.
---
That's awesome man. I'm glad to hear that for you guys. I don't mean to say it's the same way for every guild on every server, just that we should be realistic and understand the terms in which Blizzard was stating their subscriber numbers.
---
The alliance on skeram didn’t organize anything past being upset they weren’t the ones doing the corpse camping. Before transfers it honestly was like 3:2 ratio, not great but not terrible. Like the guy above me said, allies just looked for the path of least resistance. Instead of coming together and organizing actual pvp, they cried and left. Now the server is boring for both factions and will continue to get worse. There needed to be some sort of moderation and control with faction balancing.
---
This, this is your answer, "Only on populated servers where you can LFG w/o deadtime".
---
And I'll chime in too, Yes. "Dungeon Crawling" is funner, faster, and true multiplayer.
---
If you haven't rolled yet, roll on Faerlina.
---
**Also Paladins are better tanks than warriors.** When I build groups I start with a paladin tank. Hunters are notorious for being shitty, trust me, I'm a hunter, most hunters are awful at their class and trust me, the same goes with warriors; most are absolutely bad at tanking. 
---
To tank with a warrior, you have to macro and tab target your ass off and even then, a pally with blessings of salvation and consecration will hold agro better than you.
---
well sure but they should just have their add-ons sorted or be prepared to click it off everytime
---
Ah I see.
---
You're sitting here coming up with conspiracy theories about how evil Blizzard is totally going to rush everything out in classic without once even asking yourself the question of why the fuck they would be so desperate to do that when the longer it lasts means the longer they'll be getting money from it 
---
Also that guy called it "math" because it was literally that, math. You claimed they were rushing "at this pace" and so he took the current pace of 2.5/3 months per phase and spelt it out for you. You're the one who decided to randomly speculate that it's all just probing and that they're totally going to start releasing at an even faster rate with literally 0 proof while acting as if that was an obvious fact.
---
Are you saying race isn't real?
---
You have accurately identified that every problem in your life is your own fault. You are more fortunate than most.
---
TBC killed world PvP as a whole, and resilience did contribute to that. And yes, if you wanted to be a top arena player you absolutely needed a large amount of resilience gear.
---
Hell, our guild needs 1 leaf before we have to either sell or delete.
---
Curious though... does the Domo chest work like the DM chest? Can we kill the boss then have a buyer outside the instance come in and get ML’d the leaf?
---
Gotcha.
---
I'm sure it's a mix of many scenarios for many different people.
---
also if you dont have it, download exorsus raid tools
---
I empathize with you as your healer that has to frantically spam flash of light from player to player
---
Deep prot until you get good raid gear.
---
Alliance that's still on Stalagg here - Horde are just as bad about it. The other day I got camped on my alt, so I parked my 60 paladin out by my alt and killed the dude three times. He brought out six, literally six, horde 60s for me. These guys formed an actual raid group for one Alliance.
---
I don't think those were "poor" design choices though. They were par for the course at the time. FWIW I played Ultima Online, Anarchy Online, Dark Age of Camelot, EQ, Starwars Galaxies WOW and some others that came later as well. Most of my game time was spent in UO and SWG, before WOW. These design decisions are what made the game world feel like a real place. Long flight paths, corpse runs, having to go across the world multiple times to complete a quest. You're *invested* in your character. You're not just hacking and slashing your way through a game as a God. Real investment, real loss upon failure. 
---
MMOs have a terrible habit of removing all risk from the game as they evolve. Too many people want MMOs to be like single player games where you can set the difficulty level on EZPZ and be a God tearing through the world. That's fine in a single player game but it absolutely destroys MMOs. Looking back on some of the best MMOs I've played, they are the ones that had real risk involved or real challenges. You don't want to be a God in an MMO, you want to be a person struggling to get by next to everyone else who is struggling. Struggle builds camaraderie and strong bonds, fact. It's human nature. Vanilla WoW wasn't even on the terribly high end of the struggle spectrum but it had enough to form those bonds, while attracting people that couldn't handle the even more daunting trials of games like Ultima Online, Everquest or even Starwars Galaxies. Sure, you don't lose any gear or experience when you get ganked in STV, but that long corpse run is enough to make you want to win or take care to look over your shoulder. Same with engaging PvE content, don't pull too many because you're gonna walk half way across the map if you lose. I really wish someone would come up with an MMO that was built on the struggle again instead of making you a God next to other Gods.
---
Not everyone plays WoW on easy mode.
---
I love my Priest but part of me wishes I had rolled a Warrior or a Druid. Both classes due to the ability to tank and a Druid because (at least in my guild) are just showered with raid gear. Feels like there are way too many Priests everywhere.
---
Thanks Thraex all your vids have been very helpful
---
I'm pretty sure my guild will just continue raiding whether we have it on farm or not. Just like we keep raiding MC on farm right now :)
---
Yeah. The horde are the good guys in Azeroth...
---
Why not Stoneskin gargoyle
---
Ok internet big man
---
BoEs are a bit different.
---
That Warden Staff dropping means I can sell it to buy a BiS BoE for myself.
---
We were all there. That item wouldn't have dropped without all of our help. Everyone is entitled to BoEs. That's my logic.
---
BoP shit is obviously different.
---
Bigglesworth?
---
Ummm so dump my "ALL" my amazon stock before 2021?
---
Can you skin centaur (like magram in desolace)?
---
They're on Skeram.
---
Just grind dungeons for raid gear.  You're going to be running them anyway, might as well do it while you're still getting xp for it.
---
I played from Beta to Cata... started a company and stopped playing.
---
I started playing classic and am having so much fun.  But the part I loved most still exists... meeting wonderful people I would have never met before.  The real nostalgia for me was sitting in Orgrimmar and chatting with people.. and eventually running something.  Or helping my guild prepare for raids... that unity and level of friendship for someone I may never meet in person is unique and inspiring.
---
WoW Classic is about the preservation of an MMORPG, something that so rarely happens. Moving it to TBC would destroy that.
---
Classic+ would need to be optional, modularized content with some alternate, but similarly powered and skinned gear that would at most, change some BiS lists. Anything more than that would destroy the preservation effort of Classic.
---
So are you just going through and killing lashers? no bosses?
---
You can master loot in a small cave area to the right after you port in with scepter. Don't listen to these people that say you cant.
---
Thanks for the advice. To include Wisdom is a good idea. Haven't done it so far because if I was already losing out with the initial burst of threat of an SoR, I just thought using SoW would just make things worse on bosses. Will try what you recommend (using max consecrate + SoW) and see how it goes.
---
Which server is this ? Think we got a Death and Taxes guild on Thunderfury
---
I wouldn't of resubbed tbh. I love it and I will have to end it soon because I do not want to get addicted and would like to explore new hobbies.
---
I'd switch factions pretty quick just so I can kill my guildies when they have world buffs when I finally decided to quit
---
Oh like on heartseeker?
---
Well, a dream of mine is to one day work towards Thunderfury so that’s part of the reason to stick with Warrior
---
And then there's [Fengus' Ferocity](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=22817/fengus-ferocity), which says:
---
&gt; "Attack power increased by 200."
---
But it only applies to melee attack power.
---
Fitty Fitty if My math is correct
---
And my guild is the same with only one person level 60? 
---
Good job, your anecdotes prove nothing.
---
Let's be honest here even if you didn't rush you would be in the same situation with the amount you probably play (before you had nothing to do).
---
They’ll ruin classic+ just like they did retail by listening to the player base about instant gratification and the dumbing down of all RPG elements.
---
Against the grain?
---
This whole sub is one big "everything new is bad" circlejerk.
---
DPS warriors with tier pieces? Yea i bet their dps do suck then.
---
Thanks for the advice. Was thinking of using an enchant on shield, but Ill do what you suggest and put Spikes on it (currently using Argent Defender).
---
If they're unable to maintain the same server populations without layering, clearly the point of them was to help with resources.
---
It doesn't matter whether it's physical hardware, virtual hardware, or otherwise. Layering is there to ease the load on their infrastructure.
---
Okay boomer,
---
But seriously though, no we didn’t back always help others out back in classic.    You can’t help stupid, instead you point them to where they should be questing
---
Yeah the relief I felt seeing it finally drop only amplified the WTF as I notice the lock hit need.
---
Here are the things in retail which I can't stand
---
* cross-server group finder
---
* awful inflation in economy
---
* daily quests
---
* forced progression treadmill
---
* exp requirements on lower levels were too low, mobs were too easy
---
Don’t forget Herod. The first transfer to Heartseeker hurt the balance a lot.
---
Yeah. If someone made an eve clone with even marginally more interactive space flying or combat I'd probably never okay anything else.
---
I realize everything else in EVE works because the combat is the way it is, but man is it the most boring thing to play.
---
Atmosphere is insane though. I still think about just sitting in a station looking through all the menus and market and shit.
---
I dream a dream of a finished azshara  
---
I dream a dream of a finished WinterGrasp  
---
I dream a dream of a finished desolace
---
I dream a dream of uldum as it was intended  
---
And maybe even, if i dream hard enough, of a Vanilla karazhan.
---
I work outside all day. I prefer to spend my free time indoors.
---
Why did the nelf wisp come out the side the horde druid left towards?
---
God I am so glad people don’t care about iLVL......
---
The true cause of all of this shit started at the beginning by blizzard slow rolling servers out.  The fact that so many chose horde, or so many alliance transferred off when given the chance is just a symptom of the initial fuck up of only having 8 servers in the US.  That was truly the mistake.  But now people are either attached to the server or have a less than desirable playing experience because of that decision, and it's just been a trickle-down effect of bullshit ever since.   And we are blaming each other or blizzard's attempts to fix that issue rather than their underestimation of Classics popularity from the start.
---
Muh guild. I also kind of like being on the underdog side although leveling can be a bit ridiculous.
---
Yes, horde on skeram should transfer to a 10:1 alliance horde server, a server that has so many alliance because they all fled skeram when it was 40:60 alliance horde. Sounds fair
---
Is there anyone who could throw me a working Bloodfang discord link? I tried to google it, but only found expired ones.
---
Classic+ could only really include things that were planned but unfinished for pre-TBC content. To basically go another direction altogether with WoW is an interesting idea, but ultimately it's a big "Fuck you" to TBC and beyond players that got on board with Classic in order to justify the re-release of other archived expansions.
---
I hope so.. I hate people who exploit shit like this
---
Shhh, you'll give away our secrets!
---
No Only a spell Power one
---
Yeah because layering had nothing to do with how packed locations were. Not at all.
---
Pretty much all the dungeon epics are listed around .2% according to wowhead data, 40% of the drop chance you give it.
---
A hunter that doesnt want every buff even water breathing, is new to me
---
You'll be able to heal effectively in dungeons with a dps spec for a long time. Until the mid 50s
---
Might have been me.  A "melee hunter" won it over my warrior.  Can confirm, was tilted
---
NO that's not right.
---
Blizzard "allowing" it - that's such a negative way of seeing it. All Blizzard does is open servers to meet perceived demand. It's up to customer to decide where they want to go, and why.
---
We've seen it for ourselves. No matter how much people say they want it, nope we've seen ample evidence to the contrary. People roll on PvP servers where their desired faction has the numbers advantage, full stop.
---
Why should X faction roll off the server in an organized effort, if they don't want to? Everyone has access to the server board. They can see for themselves which servers are "full" which are high pop, so on and so forth. And they choose to go somehwere, where it's low-pop well that's a customer decision.
---
But I am not gonna say "oh it's your fault" like gimme a break. If they stay to enjoy the imbalance well than there you go man, people in truth don't want a fair fight...we all know this.
---
I didn’t realize this was classicwow. I wasn’t paying attention. My mistake sorry!
---
You can stop here. All the information is in the title, the rest of this thread is an I told you so circle jerk.
---
&gt;But for PvP you want the best gear which means raiding.
---
The PvP gear is way better itemized, but raiding for PvP gear won't make you hate the game
---
Yeah but add in the risk of either being screwed by your seller or by Blizzard discovering that and it doesn't sound worth it. Besides, I consider one hour of farming gold more enjoyable as one hour of working.
---
No dps ever obeys the marks anyways. They gotta get up on the damage meters
---
I enjoyed my gold more than massive stacks of dark runes, orbs, Major mana pots etc.
---
You're more than welcome to, but when your service comes a dime a dozen good luck getting someone to purchase it.
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
EVE has done amazing. It has still been a decade long struggle.
---
Thanks for the info on the proc rate. I honestly didn't understood why FA was placed on BIS list as the dmg seems so low. Was thinking instead to maybe go for Quel Serrar if things didn't improve but you make a strong case for FA.
---
Idk why they all attacked without letting the tank build threat at all. What idiots
---
Really wish i could transfer from Kromcrush to deviate for rp or just a pve server.
---
no
---
Then if it was the other way around, "is it really the alliance's fault" then I'm confident you would be in full agreement too.
---
If you can /tar it then the scan will work.
---
Yes, his wife is across the world but his main concern is internet points, because those will do...... something for him.
---
Youd be surprised what will piss people off, ive shit posted in chat (as a lvl 29 mage) 
---
**LF healer and 1 dps WC all cloth leather and mail on res, 1h and 2h FFA, all blues on res, cloth and greys round robin pst for info.**  
---
And have gotten so many nasty DMs of people pissed off that “this is what the game has become” and “kys” ive had to put people on ignore because if I log in they spam me with shit😂
---
But TBC isn't Classic WoW, either. It threw away so many aspects that made Vanilla good: the world of Azeroth that we all love, the unique items scattered around 1-60, the fact that every zone held relevancy, the world PvP, the interesting dungeon design. 
---
And it replaced it all with its own shit that it just crammed in there. TBC Outland is a complete and utter mess both from an artistic and a gameplay perspective. The races completely spat on the established lore, introducing over the top sci-fi goat people into the Alliance and an elven race into a faction whose aesthetic and theme didn't mesh with them at all. The dungeon design is all just linear hallways with reused assets galore. World PvP was killed off entirely and replaced with goddamn flying. Even battlegrounds were killed off and replaced with a new PvP system that was never experimented with before and was entirely unbalanced, forever changing how PvP was balanced and leading to homogenization
---
The reason I put my faith into Classic+ is that as long as they dont make the magnitude of mistakes that TBC does, I will be far happier with the final product.
---
Maybe you were that rare singled out asshat but most of us weren’t.
---
I don't know man, the main complain about TBC and WOTLK is the dead of world pvp (cause flying mounts and LFG system directly).  
---
I imagine Classic+ meaning TBC without this 2 functionalities (and some landscape changes of course)  
---
But I don't see this as a major change
---
The build looks okay, you still gain access to your main pve cds but lose imp slice and dice which is probably one of your most important talents at endgame. You also dont get any of the important pvp abilities like imp sap or prep, having better stealth will only really effect your ability to stealth past mobs. I've been running a similar build except stretching down to prep, dirty deeds and hemo in sub for more pvp viability while still being able to do pve content to gear up. Plan on switching to the standard cb hemo build after I've got some decent gear
---
I was 2200+ in 2v2 and 3v3 for the first 3 arena seasons in TBC. Resilience made some classes almost unkillable towards the end. We were in 45 minute long matches by the end of season 3 on a consistent basis. At that point it was literally waiting for one person to make a huge mistake or have to go to the bathroom. It also made it nearly impossible to progress because one bad loss might take 7+ hours of arena to bounce back from.
---
almost entirely useless because summoning stones
---
We have a warrior that just got his HOJ on his 126th run. He has linked it to everyone in guild lol.
---
I think it's because most people enjoy ganking more than actual competitive PvP
---
Not sure why you think TBC will naturally be "where everyone goes". Sure, that's what happened with the expac when it was new, but there's probably a lot of people who will want to stay playing classic even after TBCclassic drops
---
Holy fuck you are stupid, thanks for the sick analogy
---
Good to hear that. I couldn't do my marriage across such distance for long-term but at least you can be together in wow when possible. Good luck to you both!
---
Demonic Sacrifice - +32 agility, +10 nature resist for 30 minutes
---
Do you have any specific raid frame addons you recommend? I've been trying to find one that shows me the incoming heals but haven't had any luck.
---
Horde on Stalagg.
---
The dagger is trash and not worth the farm.
---
It is effectively 12 spell power for mages, and even worse for warlocks.
---
How do you address the fact that there just aren't enough alliance to balance the servers?
---
I am not sure private servers got it right. There were things which were behaving weirdly.
---
For example fury warriors blood craze  would activate when you are sitting down so it was even advertised as a levelling tip for warriors on private servers. In classic being hit while sitting correctly doesn’t trigger blood craze. Like how it is supposed to be.
---
Wouldn't new portals be new zones though?  Or would you use content from Legion and say one of the portals goes to Argus and just redesign that zone and others like the different zones from the legion invasion portals on Argus?
---
But there are also parts of the current contents that exist and if you want them to reuse future content anyway, then why not just pull in the karazhan raid instance since it is already there?  Or add in the blood elf areas?  or add in grim batol since that is in the game currently and add in the cata instance for it?
---
I played classic, and still like it (but not currently subbed) as I'm here but its TBC that would make me stay. I mainly PVP and Vanilla pvp is sat behind the honor system which is outpaced by raiding gear, and I have more skill than I do time so heavily prefer the skill based gear progression. I also prefer the PVP gear and PVE gear separation that came with Res.
---
 Additionally I actually liked the raids in TBC which I didn't so  much in classic. The leveling experience is a drag ofc but you only spend a short time doing it and really its all about max level. 
---
If Classic + addressed PVP gear (Important) and the honor system (Secondary) that would be a different story. I would compromise on Res stat but that leaves the window open to raiders using pvp gear, I guess they would have some issues with that.
---
Stalagg too
---
It's honestly a brilliant move.
---
Starting a new character? There's a short intro (10 levels), then you get to pick your favorite expansion and play through the whole thing. Then you just jump right into Shadowlands.
---
I wonder if that implicitly means that you won't be able to one-shot every boss in MC anymore, since MC would be scaled for level 50.
---
I tend to prefer the standard 19/32 build with picking up riposte.
---
cool
---
I use math that’s beyond me to even get into = 
---
Calculator. 
---
Those were my breakpoints with my Regen on the fights I’m in that last as long as they do for my guild. 
---
Ymmv
---
It’s too late because they would have to admit their mistake
---
Heroes are literally one of the oldest archetypes, it's nothing new and they will continue to be around as long as people persist.  It's not just modern media.
---
That might be where the graveyard is. The whisp is running back to it's body.
---
Vanilla only lasted 3 years before BC and the first year was arguably nothing but Beta testing on live servers.... seems pretty on time...
---
Shouldn't be that surprising.  The most efficient gold farmers are Mages and Hunters (*maybe* Warlocks as a third)
---
That might be it. I have a few +dmg pieces I switch to when I'm out grinding.
---
The fun isnt the gear, the fun is the challenge. It's the reason I play the game
---
&gt; I mean if you don't like arena fine
---
It wasn't fine in TBC, though. I hated arena, but I still did it because I felt I had to because Blizzard decided that you *had* to do arena to get good PvP gear.
---
IMO the arena rating specific rewards should have been restricted to cosmetics (titles and the like). Give people more honor points for having a higher arena rating or something, fine, but you should have been able to acquire the same pvp gear doing world pvp or BGs.
---
BRM is mostly level 60s. 
---
"lame" would be targeting leveling zones like Un'goro or Feralas.
---
Yeah Nathanos was already back for a while and possibly already had his new model, the cousins soul being used for his body was kinda of a back story to how his bones had skin again in the new model.
---
Petition approved.
---
There won't NB be any alliance to pony it up. So they'll have to buy a ton of new accounts to transfer those mats to.
---
I started in vanilla beta and played through when the cata patch launched (it was so awful). I came back for a short time in WoD and the game felt lifeless, then came back for legion again for whatever reason and that really was a solid time to play. I don't know what they did but they somehow managed to trip into a reasonably successful system (up until the later patches of legion imo, the endless artifact grind was awful. NEW GEAR BLIZZ, WE WANT NEW GEAR).   
---
My point, Legion was actually a solid spot to start for a lot of people imo, it's too bad BFA was awful. Classic is so good so far.
---
It's....not a solution, though. The destination is worse by a large margin. Heartseeker is around 90/10 Alliance favored compared to Skeram's 70-75% Horde favor. Solo transferring off as Horde does nothing for the imbalances and puts you on a server with a dead AH, dead raid scene, and oppressive PvP.
---
1. Blizzard does not acknowledge balance issues, never have.
---
2. Allowing faction specific transfers would tacitly acknowledge a balance issue on a given server
---
3. Blizzard doesn't do 1, so they won't be doing 2, either.
---
You realize that by transferring they just create the same situation but with anhorde minority right?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX7H-jJB7TE
---
Outlands would kill classic.
---
There will always be more horde total on pvp servers versus alliance. The racials are more fun, and give you more options for race/class choices. Super serial pvpers are probably going to be Orc, undead, or gnome. Gnomes cant be hunters or priests. Its a simple numbers game. The distribution of these players cant be forced either, and you go in totally blind.
---
Faction based Server Queues, free faction changes from dominate to less populated factions..... That is the only real solution. If being horde meant it took longer to get onto the server some would change.
---
Another option is boot the #nochanges policy and give Humans  EMFH.
---
Either or a combination would greatly help.
---
Sever transfers however will never fix faction balance and they are not even intended to. They are simply there to fix server crowding issues.
---
advantage in pve, not in pvp, which most realms are based on.
---
horde have the far better pvp racials.
---
&gt; put sidegrades into the game at those levels and for those raids
---
Nobody would play.
---
Well, that's an exaggeration, but far fewer people would play if they got no new gear/progression from doing so.
---
Anyone who spent a lot of time on pservers )and played actual vanilla) knows they didn't get it 100% right.
---
But they were closer than classic is.
---
Try to keep up, jesus.
---
&gt; Yeah, that's how racism works. Hating people for where they come from. It has nothing to do with race, ***it's a misnomer.***
---
I dont know about the murican server balance(its seem really bad tho) but on eu realm there is no alliance dominated servers, maaax 50-50 but even that is rare now because even the horde fleeing from their ruined servers to ruin the good ones. too.
---
1- No instance, they are just out there fucking around.
---
2 - Whoever gets the tag on the boss gets the loot
---
3 - I believe it was 2-4 days?
---
4 - Nope
---
The bosses do have anti deathzerg mechanics.  Kazzak is definitely the more entertaining one.  At 3 minutes Kazzak enrages and pulses out shadowbolt volleys and kills people pretty fast.  Once he enrages the fight is over because he heals each time he kills someone.  There is a lot of trolling which can happen with Kazzak if people have low level spies out to check for him which are prone to dying.  Kazzak also can throw out a debuff which which causes people to explode if they run out of mana.  On pvp servers you are vulnerable for the opposite faction throwing Arcane bombs on these people and causing spectacular wipes.
---
Azuregos and the Emerald Dragons all use the same anti-death zerg mechanics, but in different colors.  If you die in combat with one of the dragons you get a debuff.  If you get within 60 yards of the dragon with the debuff you are frozen for a minute or so.  If you try to zerg down the boss after dying, you still just be chain frozen until the dragon leaves combat.
---
title of your sex tape
---
Heartseeker is overly imbalanced with alliance. Opening transfers of Horde only would help even it out
---
I was on my tank, I said "I'll come heal on my main"
---
&gt;they can't fix it, because to fix it means giving alliance a shit ton of pvp racial like every man for himself and etc. etc. etc.
---
That's why I suggested prioritizing queues.  Everyone has a pain point where something becomes not worth it, if Alliance get instant login and Horde get a 3 hour queue - things are going to balance themselves out.
---
Obviously, he's playing WoW.
---
There is a difference between having 60/40 splits on some servers, and having basically Alliance free servers and some 90% alliance/10% Horde Servers, everyone who couldn't give a fuck anymore transfered too.
---
Icy veins info dont make bad hunters. A large portion of the hunter population are just bad players.
---
This dude is heated, dang
---
Sadly, this is pretty much the truth about Blizzard,
---
Oh you thought I meant level? lmao
---
Its too late jaina, we have to purge the entire game.
---
We have one one on Whitemane too
---
If TBC is announced for 2021, I am probably dropping blizzard completely. There is so much content in each expansion, the whole point of doing this was to experience it to the fullest and 2 years isn't nearly enough. I would rather have classic + but if we are going through expansions they should span 3 years at least.
---
Isnt MS damage related to weapon damage? Therefore isnt using MS which dual wielding ineffective?
---
I'll let you know when I find a time machine :P
---
And yeah, I'm hoping with the precedent they set for Dire Maul releasing earlier, that phases won't be set in stone, all-at-once sort of deals. That's optimistic though
---
the problem is overall population, not just individual servers
---
if the overall pvp population is 60 horde 40 alliance, this will not happen.
---
you will always have more horde than alliance, the best they can do is try and make things better, but here is the thing, people want to be on advantage side and people also want 50/50
---
if you want 50/50 reroll on another server, because it seems that your fellow people on your server wants the advantage.
---
I'd rather have Classic+ if it incorporates a lot of things people like about TBC. I want Arenas as a form of 2v2 PvP, I actually like flying mounts (maybe a capped height and an ability to dismount people for world PvP though), and I like the direction that class and spec balance took.
---
But I'd rather not rehash old content, so would prefer new raids with new talents and new gear.
---
Frost shock, purge, repeat.
---
I've heard the freedom of Vanilla described as "Do what you want because it doesn't matter; everything rewards you in an equally shit way (unless you raid)".
---
As soon as you give people decent rewards that outweigh simply grinding mobs or dungeons for money and drops, that's what they're going to do.
---
That's really dumb considering Blizz has always said that queue times would be long on packed realms and that's why they offer free transfers.
---
The raid itself doesn't cause all of the burnout, the excessive farming of materials for flasks etc is what causes the burn out. That's why guilds are stockpiling what they can now.
---
Yeah but it would've taken longer, I even wish that I started a lot later so the content drought wouldn't have been as bad. I cleared all the content two months ago and new raids seem to be far in the future.
---
I'd love to play more but the only way to progress my character is through the two hours of raiding that's available each week.
---
Then who cares?
---
If you want to sit around with your Naxx BiS forever, and spend every week trying to get your guild's Naxx run just a bit shorter, then fine. But most people would get bored since there's nothing new to work towards.
---
Yeah definitely agree, but figured it was worth noting either way.
---
I would believe this if AV didn't exist.
---
It's 100% true that if you look across PvP realms, Horde outnumber Alliance.  Suppose the ratio is 55/45 Horde/Alliance.  This should be the target population ratio for every realm.  When Blizzard sees two realms hugely out of whack, they should restrict transfers by faction.  Take Skeram and Heartseeker for example.
---
Skeram - Large server dominated by Horde 70-30 by many estimates.
---
Heartseeker - Smaller server dominated by Alliance 90-10 by some accounts.
---
Opening Horde only transfers from Skeram to Heartseeker would serve to balance both server population and faction balance on both servers.
---
So like, what's the deal with the giant wooden fork and spoon man?
---
We did it reddit!
---
I don’t mind him as a villain/ pawn of Sylvanas, but playing the Horde side in early BFA felt awful every time I spoke to the guy. 
---
“Speaker of the Horde! Humph!” 
---
Like wtf dude, what is your problem with me?
---
Definitely in the top 10 meanest quest givers, lol
---
so... what's the mechanism that will make queues appear in phase 2?
---
Frankly, I think Arena epics were a mistake. They are just way too easy to get. It might be justified if Arena was a big part of the game, but it was never super popular and the mode has aged really poorly as better competitive games came out.
---
If we get Classic+, I really hope they don't make Arena the focus of PvP again.
---
I don't disagree and that's why I think intervening with queue times is still just a bandaid fix if they're ardent about no changes - but point is it's still better than doing nothing and letting the issue fester
---
Have fun PvPing on a server that ends up being almost entirely one faction (like on retail)
---
that is doable day 1, but now, the amount of complains will be too much.
---
unless they do something like free faction transfers on top of it or something like that.
---
They actually kept their promise, bye layering 👋🏻
---
Or maybe they just want anyone to get the eff off the server so they can remove the last layer without you sitting in queues for hours during primetime.
---
They're basically asking Blizzard to force them to transfer to an Alliance dominant server, because they won't do it willingly. I've stuck around on Stalagg as alliance on principle, but it's a pretty tedious experience.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Look at his comments.  He's arrogant, he's a dumbass, and he's wrong.
---
Does not understand that "server population" !== "server capacity".
---
Right I disagree that 2.5 months is enough time for P1 so I must be triggered. Meanwhile I have a plethora of basement dwellers crying in my inbox.
---
I am enjoying the game at my own pace. That’s why I’m advocating for delaying the honor update a few weeks so I don’t have the basement dwellers running around farming honor while I’m trying to quest. Cause that’s gonna effect my pace, and I don’t think the update cycle should only cater to hardcore players. 
---
And simply suggesting that opinion is enough to get people like you all worked up. Probably cause you have nothing in your life outside of this game. You’re so sweaty you can’t even imagine a less hardcore player having a different opinion on the update schedule.
---
And hope that a healer and 3 dps also need gear from that dungeon?
---
In general, Robe of the Void and Ban'thok Sash are better than the T1 pieces. 
---
However, you're using a spec that's far from ideal in a raid, so those stat numbers you posted will be inaccurate.  Hit will probably be worth far more to you while crit will be worth less, because you don't have ruin/bane/imp sbolt.  The biggest thing you could do to improve your dps would be to respec to sm/ruin or ds/ruin.
---
Farming, selling world drops and stuff like that.
---
And a lot of the actual classic community dislikes a lot of things that were implemented in TBC/wrath; like end game continents, flying mounts, heroic dungeons, obsolete raiding tiers, low level XP squish, Dungeon/raid finder... the list goes on and on. Classic+ would be a way of taking some of the good content, e.g. dungeons and raids (the only thing end game players care about really) without implementing all of the stuff that ruined WPvP, immersion, and RPG identity.
---
I also find it funny that you included Wrath in that list... Which literally just lifted raids from classic and remastered them for Wrath, like  Ony and Naxx. If you were fine with wrath doing it, what's the issue with classic+ doing it?
---
You're either being obtuse or you're just really stupid. The VAST majority of Horde players, myself included, rolled on a popular server hoping for a perfect (or at least close) faction balance. It's not fun playing on a server with a significant disadvantage - but it's also not fun playing with a significant advantage either.
---
This isnt possible though. When you picked your server, you had no idea what the ratio of horde to alliance would be. Even if 100 players """"colluded"""" to pick a server, thats a drop in the bucket of the totals. I agree its customer driven but there isnt a greater conspiracy. If I was on a server that was 10:1 alliance to horde as a horde, and they offered me a transfer to a server that was 5:1 horde to alliance, id feel obligated to take it. Corpserunning constantly while trying to mine is a lot worse than a zone overcrowded by your own faction.
---
Because we are old casual players. Not in college or have enough time to really care all that much.
---
I don't know why they are offering transfers on Blaumeux still. Haven't had a queue since layers were removed. Population is healthy and seems mostly balanced as far as I can tell.
---
For that i totally agree, it was a dumb feature that was  a fucking pain for casual player and other who wanted to pvp for fun. But if you compare it to rank 14 in classic. Classic was way worst. At least pve gear was good in pvp in classic.
---
I wish the Druid code was real. I’ve been ganked in moon glade twice now by lvl 60 Tauren.
---
Same as the others, I do this all the time without PI. Constant 40g/hr
---
Not really. The reason many people unbind them is because of the chance you accidentally activate it, similar with bloodlust.
---
Not quite. You are off by a factor of 10 because you don't take onto account that part order doesn't mater.
---
In order to get this you need the number of combinations of choosing 3 party members as the 100s rollers.
---
This is 5 nCr 3 = n!/(n-r)!r! = 5!/(2!x3!) = 10
---
(.01^3)×(.99^2)×5!÷(2!×3!) = 9,801/1,000,000
---
Uh. I care. That's why I said I wanted it.
---
Yeah I'm real worried that a Classic+ will include continued garbage spec balance, garbage itemization on items, non-competitive PvP, and the awful+frustrating loot experience of classic (only one spec gets your tier set, other specs have to usually roll down in armor classification)
---
Just curious what’s so good about this pet?
---
Arcane pots... I knew I was forgetting something :)
---
Yeah I personally thing a two prong approach with faction specific queue times and transfers is their best shot of addressing the problem
---
Allowing unbiased transfers like they're doing now is *worsening* it
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. 39 twink bracket is probably the 2nd most popular (next to 19)

Why should a healer get to reserve them if the tank can’t? Realistically everyone should roll for spots, winner gets first orb, second highest gets second orb and so on. Especially if planning on multiple runs. Calm yourself down and build your own groups and reserve the orbs if you’d like.
---
It proves that your narrative of everyone who's 60 and raiding must just be a basement dweller or antisocial introvert with no greater responsibilities is false.
---
The overwhelming majority of people in the active raiding community, from what I've seen on Stalagg, are of the same demographics. This isn't Fortnite, the average player in Classic is easily in their 20's and none of this should really be surprising.
---
get The Outer Worlds!
---
&gt; Who cares?
---
Their boss cares. You wouldn't want to pay someone if he does a worse job than the guy before him.
---
Not true at all. There are several hardcore Alliance guilds on Skeram that have embraced the challenge of playing on a tough server and have no intention of leaving.
---
Auto Hotkey does this and can be used while playing wow I use it for one button rotations on retail.
---
Buzzword game on point. But yeah I would imagine that most of the alliance that couldn't cut it on a contested server are not worth playing with. 
---
Shame to see a server in such a state. If only they would have handled transfers better. Hopefully your server picks up to a healthy state.
---
I don’t want to make too general of a statement but for the most part if you are losing aggro it’s your groups fault not yours. 
---
Make sure you mark a skull target and keep hold of that one target, as long as you throw in a few thunderclaps it will keep the others off the healer.
---
If you have mages/warlocks/warriors who are running in and cleaving instantly theres nothing you can really do to hold aggro.
---
Challenge? All the content was piss easy 14 years ago and it'll be even easier this time around. The fun is character progression. If I wanted difficult raids with shitty character progression I'd play retail.
---
It is very possible and I highly recommend the following spec, as it will give you great solo questing ability and also great heals in dungeons. It is worth noting that, imo, shadow does not give you a massive damage boost until you are able to get shadowform. Add in the fact you can farm SM for several levels beyond 40 and I think it's worth doing the following:
---
(This spec is only used until you ding 40/45, then you go full shadow spec to get shadowform + 5/5 wand)
---
Disc: 5/5 Wand
---
Shadow: 5/5 Spirit Tap. 2/2 Improved Shadow Word: Pain
---
Holy: 2/2 Healing Focus. 3/3 Improved Renew. 5/5 Divine Fury. 3/3 Blessed Recovery (especially if you are on a pvp server). 2/3 Inspiration. 3/3 Improved Healing.
---
This will get you to level 39. After which I suggest you go 5/5 wand and full shadow- grabbing shadowform at 45. OR Going full shadow at 40 and getting the wand spec back to 5/5 at 45. Wanding is still a great source of damage, even in shadowform, and will keep you from going oom and drinking too much.
---
Personally I've been grinding for 3 levels post-40 and I think I have sat down to drink like 5-10 times, and only because I goofed and pulled too many and had to burn through mana.
---
I mean the belt and boots both exist, and very shortly the pvp trink will to.
---
And the better mages I'm fighting will try to do things like juke the reflector or change strats up after their bloody introduction to warr v mage's reality - the thing is, I've got a fire reflector too.
---
And if I feel like a dick, a FAP is basically an "I win" button. Pop one before the first nova and a mage has two options - die to the warrior who spent 40s or IB CS IB and then fight from an extreme back foot.
---
Much as I love me some classic, I would prefer TBC over Classic+ if for no other reason then because I don't think it's even possible or realistic for them to do the latter. Also, TBC will always hold a special place in my heart as it was when I really delved into WoW and started raiding for real.
---
&gt; Your experience is just one experience. Those guilds are a combination of bad attitudes, poor leadership and I doubt many of those guilds continue to survive. 
---
&gt; Find a guild of like minded people. I joined a guild who's main advertisement was their political view IRL. Not that those thing are always going to be good, but because many of the people can related on a level other than loot in the game, it creates solidarity in the group as a whole. The leadership cares about helping the people we have learn their class and roles and do the best they can instead of trying to recruit 40 "try-hards" who're going to quit as soon as they get some chase loot. 
---
&gt; I'm the rogue "officer" but I'm one of 7 rogues on the main roster and we've been having a blast rolling against each other on all our tier (because we know, hey, we're eventually going to get it all and it's barely an upgrade from pre-raid BIS) and are excited for each other to get loot. Big loot like Brutality Blades and Perdition are loot council'ed based on attendance, contribution, consumables, and work being done towards bis/pre-raid bis. We all get EXCITED for the other people because we can't wait to see who's going to be on top of the meter next time after getting a core-hound tooth, etc. 
---
&gt; TL;DR I hope you find people/a guild with better attitudes like your own, because they do exist.
---
It’s great for pvp so keep it
---
good one millenial
---
What isn't irrational, is what happened, why it happened and what we have today. capiche?
---
Lmao haHAA
---
Lol you alliance on Skeram are the same way, never 1v1 always 5v1.
---
I think you should be able to move on with a character in tbc but not in classic anymore. Keep classic but have the option to transfer a or as many characters as you want, but be able to leave however many you want on classic
---
I guess I wasn't the only one who clicked this as the top pinned topic assuming it was the daily QA thread...
---
There isn’t years of content to do in these expansions.
---
Former Skeram player now on Earthfury here, so far haven't experienced any issues with server population of imbalance. I love pretty much everything about it

&gt; One horde only from Herod

And then nobody opts into the transfer...

&gt;lot of trouble holding agro
---
&gt;do both tank and dps.
---
You'll have more trouble holding aggro and be less tanky. I know fury prot tank are trendy but they're shit. Dont, keeping aggro with a warrior, its the easiest class for so... I suggest you should investigate into keepig aggro instead of respecing, by that I suggest to read about the class, get yourself some addons to help, getting better at leading cuz a tank that lead a group is the greatest to spam dungeons quickly. There is definitly a reason why you dont hold aggro well, maybe its your group that cant focus the same as you. I mean, all of this is only if you want to stay tank ! If you just dont have fun and would rather go dps, go full fury but dont be that fury tank guy, we hate them
---

---
I wish i could upvote this response more. Literally said everything I felt on this topic but more literate than I would have been. Thank you.
---
Skrew this  ninja
---
if your healers are not coordinated then high healing done and low overhealing is likely the best metric to judge on. However I would advise working with your guild leadership to discuss how to coordinate better with healer assignments and roles, then the metric should be performing your task in that context.
---
And then turned into a mount
---
&gt; You will be splitting the playerbase between the Classic servers and TBC servers. There will be a massive outcry if people can't remain on the Classic servers.
---
Why can't we just say "tough shit"? The people who have done nothing but re-play classic content on a cycle on multiple private servers for the last decade shouldn't be the ones we cater to. They're a loud and often angry minority.

Deep prot until you cannot hold threat anymore aka post bwl. Fury tanking costs healers too much mana and threat from dps isn't high enough to warrant it
---
I swapped largely so I didn't have to drink as often when healing; with a good group I could have probably stayed shadow without issues.
---
Did they talk about this specifically? Because based on the other stuff they talked about, you would assume that MC would be mid-20s content since theyre just cutting levels by 60% (120-&gt;50, 100-&gt;40, etc).
---
I think people are kinda OK with being that, regarded as a cut above the others. But by no means should they ever *be* the reason for the game.
---
it's because he's level 53 doing BRD runs likely with at least a few DPS who are level 58-60. He's just not going to be able to hold threat.
---
Imagine needing 25 people to kill ONY... KEKW
---
True, the epic pvp gear in Classic is basically unobtainable for people who don't pvp *a lot*. I guess we'll see how it really feels after Phase 3 comes out with BGs. I remember getting to Legionnaire back in vanilla (was that rank 7 or 8?) and I played a lot, but I was also much younger and as a result probably wasn't playing very effectively.
---
At least the BG faction rewards aren't terribly difficult to obtain, they just require some time commitment, but you can spread that out over several months if you want.
---
This type of restriction would never work brotha, people just wouldnt make a character on that realm period. In the lens of pvp, horde just has more going for it. The fantasy is stronger imo with 4 very unique races with super strong pvp racials. Alliance have humans (you are this irl) dwarves (stubby human) gnomes (baby human with very strong pvp racial) and elves (pretty dope imo), Horde have 4 races that feel unique from each other due to appearance and class choices, and dank racials for each

---
But if I do that.... I won't get big crits. Oh no.......
---
I used to enjoy raiding, but having to fit it around life isn't fun and eventually something has to give.
---
Plus, the Horde scum on Skeram can’t take my precious thorium/crystals if I just solo DME &lt;taps forehead&gt;
---
Very unlikely. The classic team already has everything created from previous expansions. I imagine their job consists of coding and bug testing. 
---
Classic + would require a development team to create new assests, audio, story design, etc. Also the huge mind fuck that would be how would it effect current lore. Like I'm sure they would just do a "reimagining" of tbc rather than completely making something fresh.
---
Yeah you move with a guild to balance out. Or chose a server that is more balanced. You’re complying about imbalance but chose to take no action of your own to fix your problem. You know if you stay on your server there will be imbalance. This isn’t going to change unless a lot of horde move but you’re unwilling to transfer to one of the many servers they are asking you to transfer that are more balanced. Why don’t you be proactive and transfer to a more balanced server instead of complaining like you can’t do anything.
---
At least someone understands that Blizzards decisions are made to please shareholders and they really don't care how much you all whine.

---
Isnt it better to just have a Resto shaman?
---
You get to pick your choice of expansion, and you only played through one. It sounds like all other expansions are going to be scaled from 10-50.
---
So if TBC was your fav expansion, you start Hellfire at 10, and hit 50 by the time you're finishing up Nether thing and Shadow thing (sorry forgot the zone names lol).
---
I really think it’d be prudent for them to add in game surveys/polling for questions from active players to solicit feedback on what’s truly wanted.
---
I think if they had a questionnaire on content pace or classics future they’d be able to get a broad amount of actionable feedback from the people playing the game.
---
E.g what would you like to see after Naxxramas? 
---
Classic only
---
Classic +
---
This serves as the macro question.  
---
Then ask a question a layer deeper.
---
Why did you vote classic only? 
---
Don’t like TBC
---
Worries Classic+ would be done poorly 
---
Naxx forever
---
How would you like classic+ to be done? 
---
Existing Azeroth content only?  Kharazan/Hyjal/grim batol
---
Fresh stuff is okay, but we stay at 60.
---
Profession and pvp patch.
---
Stuff like this done every few months could help them gather where players hearts and desires are.  Many folks are in this for the long haul.  It was passion that made them finally listen.  I think they’d be apt to hear directly from their active players.
---
Here's how you do it - TBC first, and maybe wrath next (though I'd probably hang around in TBC).  Then, make a TBC+ srv where all other versions can transfer.  Yes, you will need a system to fairly move people, scaling levels, gold, and perhaps a gear/mats trade/currency of some sort to keep people around where they progressed.
---
Keeping up 3-4 different srvtypes isn't a huge deal if they do it right, they won't require much maint. - can always servermerge when needed, and as for bugs, either fix or ban exploiters, easy.
---
TBC+ Can scale a lot of lvl60 content to 70, remove Shat as the hub city, keep flying only in outlands, and expand zones/raids in azeroth and outlands.
---
It doesn't matter if only 3-5k play on a particular version, as that's enough to fill a server.
---
If it’s an upgrade that you will use for your main spec, you need. Simple. Who cares if it’s BIS for someone else but technically only prepaid BiS for you. An upgrade is an upgrade. OS rolls is a different story.
---
I hate all these trendy fury tanks. That’s a stage of Vanilla, but it’s not this phase. It’s horrible to heal and every trendy fury tank lacks all awareness to realize they’re almost being KOd every few seconds.
---
Same people that immediately pull after a near-wipe kind of people
---
Wildstar had excellent combat that puts wows at the time to utter shame. 
---
You're just talking through your rose tinted glasses. Which is the only reason wow classic did so well. Although that'll die off soon enough. Already is, tbh.
---
My original equation also works for mahes.
---
FYI- 
---
     Druid/pally/hunter/shaman - 15 + (Spirit/5) mp2
---
     Warlock - 8 + (spirit/5) mp2
---
It is like you ignore all the other shit that I type out and argue about whatever the fuck you want. It was an example of how "Yea technically that is better than the shit you have but that doesn't mean its good for you". 
---
BiS lists also list out easy to obtain items. This fuckface can't be bothered to go look up anything and wants justification for being an asshole and taking an item that is a slight upgrade over someone who got a rare best in slot for 6 phases.
---
Back when male NE didn't run like they have a giant stick in their ass
---
I dont know how you guys do it! Good on you for taking up tanking in the first place, game needs more of y'all.
---
Then you have to travel to ironforge to finish the job.
---
Do you know if this changed in burning crusade to give ranged AP?
---
Arena has a hardcore base, but that base is very small. It has had a outsized impact on PvP design.
---
I would be happy just giving the few people who enjoy arena Build Templates so everyone else could just ignore the mode. Then Blizzard could focus on redesigning PvP in a way that engages more of the playerbase.
---
The extra ~850 armor on Cloak of Warding is a big deal.
---
Because then nobody would transfer.  Why would anyone willingly go from a dominate faction to an underdog faction?  They wouldn't... for the same reason that minority faction flee's because they are tired of being the minority.
---
Unyielding Maul (which is superior) is being sold for as little as 35g on my server by hunters who solo tribute runs.
---
If you are too poor for that, save a little better.
---
I cling to the concept.
---
I know it will never occur and do not trust this dev team what-so-ever to ever succeed in doing it well.
---
But damn how cool that would have been.
---
You all want them to fucking destroy TBC like they did for Classic?
---
I think TBC talent trees are garbage.
---
I get that I'm alone in this.
---
Just weird that the thing I hate the most is the first one you listed.
---
Yay anime elves.
---
i'll check it out, thanks!
---
Didn't say they should - that kind of imbalance isn't fun for anyone. The guy I responded to thinks that Horde transferring off of Skeram is the solution to the problem. Except Horde can only transfer into a server that is far more imbalanced than Skeram was for Alliance.
---
Ah thank you!
---
No, 1 in a million divided by 10 gives you 1 in 10 million. 1 in a million times 10 gives you 1 in 100,000

You cant blame all Horde for playing a more fun looking faction. Its a fantasy game and horde has better fantasy. Who wants to be a human, a stubby human, or a tiny human, when you could be a savage orc with an insane racial, spoopy undead, wily troll, or big bad tauren
---
The server Thunderfurry
---
&gt; those who wanted to actually enjoy the game and gone to a balanced servers
---
That's the thing, though. They didn't leave to go to a balanced server. They left to go to a server which has the same problem but in favor of alliance.
---
That's all well and good and nostalgic. But at this point the player character has delved several ancient ruins, fought in the blackrock mountain, and done many notable things of their own. Despite not being a thrall-tier hero they aren't some random worthless peon.
---
"My lifei s empty and meaningless without your guidance" is definitely an over the top and kissass thing to say.
---
Words of wisdom
---
I mean historically Blizzard ( and Blizzard-Activision now) has been doing this exact thing every quarter for the last 12 years at least, arguably longer.
---
So in other shocking news, fire is still hot.
---
You're fine to have your opinion man.  I too would want delayed content if I was slow because leveling from 50-60 during Phase 2 is gonna be a real pain in the ass.  
---
This little argument with me posting my opinion and you jumping down my throat saying the game should not cater to me because I have no life.  For someone who is not triggered, you certainly resort to ad hominem attacks quickly.
---
Blizzard doesn't care about faction balance. These transfers aren't for faction balance - they are 100% about them getting rid of the last layers.
---
Furthermore, server transfers could never solve faction balance issues because the issue is total number of horde vs total number of alliance in the region. If you want to solve that problem you need to convince a portion of the horde players to play alliance. You can't do that without changing the game because asymmetric factions dictate where people chose to play (primarily Paladin vs Shaman and Racials).
---
They could have tried to tackle the faction balance issue from the drop by limiting character creation on skewed servers, but there's no guarantee that has the desired result (i.e. getting someone that was going to play horde to play alliance vs just not playing at all). At this point, the only real solution is to allow free faction swaps on imbalanced servers (if that's even possible within the classic architecture) and hope for the best.
---
No matter what you want to do for the faction balance problem, know that the server transfer thing has literally nothing to do with it. It's a non starter for solving faction balance issues. They are simply trying to get rid of layers like they promised (and yeah, they could have done a much better job at launch to solving this problem).
---
You can't keep things at 60 unless you do a stat squish every so often. By the time Naxx rolled around, people in Naxx gear were 2shotting each other and 1shotting everything else. 
---
Would be stupid to have Kara/SSC/TK in Vanilla at 60 because the items would either be no upgrade over Naxx, or you'd be nearing the point where people have 100% crit chance. 
---
A stat squish would infuriate people and invalidate old content, and you wouldn't feel any stronger for moving forward.
---
Leveling up to 70 is the only way that makes progression make sense.
---
There's a human rogue from &lt;Reign&gt; who pops perception and ruins our lives in the Silithus hives whenever he/she is around. We basically have to just do our best to avoid Hyperskaya(?) because we will get 100-0'd period. That person must be swimming in arcane crystals, mad props.
---
I give my blessing of might to every person I pass. Warriors and mages alike. YOU get a blessing, and YOU get a blessing, EVERYONE gets a blessing!
---
:) Just make sure you pre-pot one, and have the other ready for popping mid fight.  We did this last week and shazz literally died in like 45 seconds.
---
&gt; there's a good amount of modern WoW players that have tried Classic and won't go back to modern wow
---
How many players do you imagine gave up retail after trying classic for the first time?? Not that it matters (they share the same sub) but it seems like that number is wildly insignificant compared to the number of players who were tempted top come back for a nostalgia trip.
---
There’s also a lot of bones everywhere, and the traditional drawing of a bone, when cut in half, is a shaft with two circles on one end.
---
WC3 Reforged == WC3 RoC/TFT with updated assets, the story is not changing
---
ph3 i think
---
It’s due to Regrowth being the best for sniping. Not much healing is needed and Regrowth Crits are .5 Seconds faster, massive and keep targets topped
---
Deep Resto is actually pretty shit but it’s good for heal sniping and screwing over other Druids :P
---
This video should be on the front page or /r/classicwow, spammed on Blizzard's twitter, classic forums, the front page of the damn New York Times even.
---
Oh interesting, thats not how I assumed it would work. I knew you could go back and play through however you wanted, but I was under the impression it was to level cap and you could hop around to the different areas.
---
worst part is, when shit like this happens it's ALWAYS the other guy that wins the roll. This is how a tank in my Mara group lost out on a guaranteed Blackstone ring to a warlock :(
---
You can always level more classes though!
---
You got it! In another note, i never know if I should be giving druids might or wisdom.  I’m talking about when out running and passing a player on the road. Usually go might but it’s only 5 min so not to big a deal I guess.
---
Better than your neckbeard reply
---
I was talking about Classic. You must be slow.
---
It has nothing to do with queues. It's only about faction imbalance
---
1. Re spec as required since a lot of the good spells for PVP are in shadow and PVE in disc.
---
2. Spec blackout and spam rank one SW:P. Dispel magic as required and silence casters at clutch moments.
---
3
---
 I don't know.
---
4. If your gear is all "BIS" non tier without stamina and intellect stacking you are going to have a bad time
---
I thought they said in a post that servers were down to a max of two layers or less?
---
That looks like a PVE spec to me friend, but it also looks like a good spec to play as combat.
---
PvP server doesnt mean you should level with a PvP spec, you should choose a spec that allows you to kill efficiently with little downtime. the spec you linked will do just fine but its not a good PvP spec for 60, just so you know.
---
They don't expect you do, its just competitive. It rewards players who play the most..... which is relative.
---
If everyone were reasonable, well adjusted human beings then it'd be different but...... in this case the most savagely disgusting putrid filthy nauseating decaying vile horrid wretched souls will reign supreme.
---
So, seriously, if you see people who are rank 14..... the odds are they are far too gone to even speak to.
---
I wonder if anyone's reached rank 14 and then gotten banned, or lost their computer or something...
---
At what +healing should I be consistently downranking? I'm just beginning to gear up for preraid BiS and am mostly using rank 3 of Greater Heal and rank 4 when the tank is below 50%. Is this wrong? I was just looking at IcyVeins and they don't even mention rank 4 of Greater Heal. Don't have an exact number, but I believe my +healing is probably only around 100.
---
Exactly this. Que times are what caused this not factions. I feel bad for ANYONE, horde or alliance, who has their experience ruined from a que. If you got btfo in wpvp you could do something about that. Party up, make a big stink and get players together to go fight. Camp low level towns to piss off horde, whatever, thats the game! Thats what makes it fun! Sitting looking at the que slowly tick down with your peen in hand is the fastest way for a player to cancel their sub.
---
I mean sure you could test whether the subscription base stays strong if Blizzard decides to delay content but I'm not sure they're gonna do that.  I'm not saying they need to release BWL tomorrow I'm just saying the pace they have set seems more than fine and I don't see a reason to delay things.
---
ok boomer
---
The overwhelming majority of people are not in top guilds.
---
Top guilds are also are built and play differently.
---
So again your comment comes off silly like your last.
---
of Warcraft
---
It instantly got downvoted when i posted it on /r/classicwow, because this sub is filled with people who have as much clue about balance as the blizzard devs.
---
You wish hunters had those shoulders.
---
Can a warrior do it?
---
But you didn't even test aquatic form!
---
If you run them away from you it breaks easier
---
If you are a PVP player there is absolutly no need to do anything else, in classic you HAVE TO go through the entire content for the absolute best gear. Thats how an MMO should be, this is not a e-sport PVP game...
---
They do know a lot. Since I was young and stupid. But now I don't use any of their services. They know less.
---
What is a 'jump' run? Is that in BRD? jumping out the window?
---
I don’t know how much you play the game. If you consider a personal attack when I call the hardcore players no lifers, that’s your own problem.
---
And if you expect everyone to be level 60 ready to pvp 2.5 months into the release of  the game, you’re probably a no lifer. Again, if you find that offensive, that’s your problem.
---
It might suck realizing that other people actually have lives outside of a video game if you don’t. But for the third time, if you have a problem with that, *that’s your problem*.
---
If you have no problem being a no lifer, cool! I don’t really care either way. But don’t expect everyone to be okay with an update schedule that caters to your lack of a life.
---
No, this was on Shattered Hand, early 2006.
---
Said differently, this should remind Hunters that they can wield spell power staves and gear as well. Arcane shot scales with SP in an interesting way.
---
I do because tbc was the beginning of the end for people like me. Really not into hordish elves and paladin's lol.
---
Just go back to Arms so you can level a bit on your own. Dont need to be prot unless youre MT in a raid, which you are not doing until 60.

I would’ve sold that shit and made 4K by now it’s been 12 days bro
---
It would be interesting to see which patch they choose for Wrath. When they eventually get to that patch with the pre ICC stuff that has the Group Finder, I think they should leave it out.
---
Not the original client, a frankenstein re-created client named 1.12.
---
Where are you getting your info? In my experience, he shadowbolts and heals anytime someone dies before the enrage. When he enrages you can’t possibly win but you can win pre enrage with greater shadow protection potions and good healers. You can also ruin an attempt for a guild by running in and dieing healing kazzak up. This works with hunter pets fir same faction as well.
---
This is Blizzard's attempt to avoid using competent modern servers.  
---
"We gave you the option to move, it's not our fault that large scale PVP battles lagged your server" -Blizzard
---
They'll be able to find a healer and 3 dps that needs gear from that dungeon.
---
He made two completely different statements. I'm pretty sure this isn't a problem with understanding as much as it is a problem communicating.
---
*Green Moses
---
My point is that even if the lag were fixed, world PvP is still very much irrelevant because of DHKs.  World PvP will never be a  relevant source of meaningful progression in Classic, period, and acting as if that isn't true belies everything we saw during Vanilla after the implementation of DHKs.
---
Warding with +50 armor enchant, no doubt about it.
---
Not really. Just keep moving on. Learn to have a little bit of patience, or to give two shits less.
---
Not sure if joking or simply a mouth breather.
---
Sounds like I'm on the wrong server. Everyone is super uptight about class specs even in dungeons.
---
I was close to being in your situation, my friend group was horde back in the TBC days, but the ones who played retail more recently (and myself in legion) were alliance. Eventually we settled on horde as a back to the roots kind of thing. We didnt think the imbalance on some servers would be this heinous.
---
what we really need is a time machine back to launch, back to the early character creation, and each server should have had a heatmap of sorts indicating faction balance, with a kind of soft cap from the very start. If a server is approaching 60+% one faction during the PRE launch phase when you can only make 3 characters, stop letting people make characters there lol. Of course this offers no recourse now, but might have been effective at launch.
---
Blizzard should just make a super server, combine Skeram and Heartseeker, and make it permanently 2 phases haha
---
Actually, they'll just blink out of the stun. This works well for every class BUT mage.
---
Transfers are here to reduce server population not to balance out factions.
---
I have a general kill order (healers --&gt; CCers / Casters --&gt; high dmg targets --&gt; beefy targets), but this can change on a situational basis. For example in BRD some groups like to go for the marshal's first (squishy healer dwarves) while other's prioritize fire elementals (very high dmg that can hit the entire party if oriented wrong). It comes down to what your group is and what you're facing. If you have a druid tank, 2 rogues, shammy, and a mage as your group, you'll have interrupts / silences for daaaays, so you can focus the high dmg target and just kick / silence any heal attempts. If your group has 0 interrupts, obviously try to burst down the healers.
---
Also, there was a post a while back about mobs in SM. I have not tested this, but apparently female mobs tend to be stronger. So to add to your issue of who to prioritize, now you can take gender into account too! If there's two healers and one is male other is female, go for the female first.
---
not a boomer but thanks :)
---
Why is this guys enjoyment more important then that of the Alliance who dont want to fight 1v5 all day
---
The fact you're justifying HoJ to a hunter cause they have wingclip, raptor strike and auto attacks just shows how dense you really are. Bet DHC is ok to need on as a warrior over a hunter cause hey... we warriors do pull with guns so clearly an upgrade!
---
IMO don't feel pity for them. Feel pity for those people who are truly addicted maybe, but there are people who legitimately have lives that allow them to play that much AND they want to do it.
---
More power to them, I say. If that is what they enjoy then go for it. I hope they aren't ultra addicted, and if they are, I hope they eventually break out of it.
---
I play horde on skeram and I want to fucking move. Everything is overfarmed, world pvp is borderline nonexistent, and the general attitude on the server is toxic af, and i don't want to be anywhere near a turbo tryhard guild like ONSLAUGHT.
---
Free transfers opening on the day that honor system is added will make unbalanced servers even more unbalanced and a train wreck to gain rank.
---
When you get brutality blade or viskag
---
Well it appears to be an article regarding an NFL team that was losing, but then won instead, followed by an ad for a shitty video game that has a character creation screen that ripped off WoW
---
The queue applies before you login and character select, and belongs to your logged in session.
---
I would hate to switch characters and get a queue
---
If you're tanking dungeons, please go arms and get a decent 2hander so you have access to some tools to get a quick threat lead on AoE. I don't want to wait 20 sec for you to stack sunders. I prefer 30 min clears over 50 min clears. A healer should have no issue healing a warrior in plate gear wearing a 2hander if he does smaller pulls. This will keep damage high and ensure a faster run. Rather than doing 1 bigger pull, you do many small pulls of 2-3 mobs.
---
You need to mark targets and get the dps to focus things down as a group. You will never hold aggro from multiple targets if each dps attacks something separate.
---
Deep prot is the easiest to hold aggro with. Charge in and use Demo Shout or pull and use Battle Shout just to get some initial aggro on everything, then tab SS/Revenge/Sunder. Auto attacking is also a big part of your threat.
---
il buy one for 10 copper w/ me.
---
Yea and people can enter arenas naked, whats your point?
---
What I didn't like about TBC was that from the minute you went through the dark portal you were picking up gear that would replace anything from vanilla. Even greens dropping off helboars were upgrades to items you had raised for months to get.
---
It made all the 60 content of vanilla immaterial. Best to run straight into hellfire peninsula at 58 to get better gear than running any more vanilla content.
---
I never liked that. It should have taken longer to replace those hard earned purples.
---
Took me 16 years, too, friend. Pass on the info
---
I'm fine with TBC but after that it needs to go TBC+
---
I apologize for this buddy :( I never gank unless attacked.
---
I was there on Skeram with a 7:1 H:A ratio. I'll never gank anyone again. If you see Micro polymorph you I'm just trying to heal you &lt;3
---
Use it for your big cooldowns (vanish, blind etc...)
---
And the people you see, no interactions because you will never see each other again. I really enjoy seeing familiar names and guilds in classic even though I'm not very social.
---
Faction based server queues.
---
I think Faerlina actually has 2 layers, we will see what happens tuesday though.

---
If you just want to tank dungeons I'd go deep prot with reduced taunt CD.
---
If you like to also dps or pvp, then go deep arms maybe 31-20 or 31-5-15
---
Most important thing about tanking dungeons is what mobs you are targeting, and how you use your taunt. 
---
Your taunt is not just a threat ability. It gives you the same threat as whoever has aggro, and puts the aggro on you. This means you can do absolutely nothing to a mob, taunt it at 50%, and then do 1 threat ability, and you will hold aggro until it dies pretty much. I would recommend keybinding skull and moon´, skull for focus nad moon for whatever CC if you need it. You don't always need to be marking stuff, some groups do fine without it and it's a bit of a  hassle. The focus target is usually obvious anyway. So on pulls, go in and make sure you got aggro on everytihng but skull, give it all a couple of hits so the healer or some huntard using multi doesn't pull aggro, then taunt the skull. It's okay for your dps to have aggro on skull for a little bit, the world won't end because of it at least if it's a melee tanking aggro, if not then a early taunt is nice to keep it all in range. NEVER waste your taunt on a healer overaggro or something like that, if you can get aggro back with a sunder, then always do that. Your taunt is super useful for when dps goes crazy, use it for that

&gt;a less populated server that might be more balanced 
---
Unfortunately I don't think that's an option. They have to choose if they'd rather be badly outnumbered or be playing on a near-PvE server.
---
Is that not what I just said?
---
I think it’s called that because In the alpha or beta the undead could speak common and they keep cursing and talking shit to ally when they killed them to the point they took it out of the game and named it gutterspeak.
---
The most fun I ever had in Tol Barad was after everyone already abandoned it except for a few doing dailies. 1v1s aplenty, small skirmishes whenever you wanted.
---
The actual zerg vs zerg part of it was awful.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/91217n/where_can_i_download_the_1121_client/
---
No, it's LITERALLY the 1.12 client, created by Blizzard. You have no idea what you are talking about.
---
1. Unless you're the guild's designated shadow priest, you're likely going to lose any 1v1 you end up in. Another poster in this thread had [This](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500222133525101-2050510303) build, which is a pretty good balance of healing and survivability. Also, healing focus is significantly better than imp. renew.
---
2. With a non-shadow build, your options are to fear, watch as the 70% of the horde population who rolled undead just ignore it, PWS, renew, and try not to get interrupted while you wait 30 seconds for fear to come back up.
---
3. Use PI on yourself if you're alone and you're hardcasting, or use it on any casters you bring with you asap so they can hopefully explode someone.
---
We've just started to get the paladins to heal our pets to pad meters.  Now if we can just convince them to start buffing them too...
---
Is using it for cold blood worth while?
---
I don't think you skin it
---
There are only two outcomes when meeting another druid so far for me. Either we are best buds or it's an instant fight to the death.
---
This needs to be on the front page of reddit.
---
Again, if you are farming for a low drop item, not reserving the item is the worst decision you could do.  Assuming the hunter would pass or just greed flies in the face of every 'huntard' meme and 'casual' stereotype.  It's like parking your gold plated Lexus overnight in the middle of gang turf of Chicago.  It's implied no one should take it from you but you put yourself in that situation.
---
"Technically better than the shit you have" is how RPGs are played.  A +1 to stats or a +20 is an upgrade.  And to deny a player a huge upgrade of a dungeon blue item because it's BiS for someone else, without considering that level of upgrade is absurd.  If I told you that the damage parse from the warrior would not even have a difference of 1% due to the trinket but pushed the hunter's damage 5%, would you still say, give it to the hunter?
---
This is how I'm going to gear for raiding.  If a piece is not on my BiS but would be a huge upgrade over my current gear, I'm going to need.  Unless reserved, I don't care if it is BiS for someone else or that I could get my BiS tomorrow.  I have no guarentee over anything happening in game.  Gaining +20 in stats while the other player is getting +1 or +2 is laughable when demanding I pass.
---
You can be in 2nd, 3rd, 4th pre raid BiS and still make the raid roster.  Asking to join in quest greens from level 45 because no one let you roll on major upgrades "it isn't BiS for you" is going to be rejected.  So yeah, on blues, if it is a meaningful upgrade roll.  BiS has 0 place in determining who can or cannot roll.  A player can choose to pass but shaming them into passing because big dick dps warrior wants his 1% dps upgrade is fucking stupid.
---
44. mind flay rank 4, you can get shadowform and nearly max out your wand spec. before that, it's better to stay 5/x/5.
---
"You lost me here. What does this mean?"
---
I was supposed to say "buy the new expansion" and wrote "be the new expansion" :D

"The question is, would those Classic people actually put money down to pay for expansion packs?"

Just as much as the retail players pay for expansions? :) Beside it doesnt have to be an expansion, it could be a patch, if blizzard felt generous, hahahaha :D

Alliance is fucked
---
It’s more than 2 mobs, AoE it is!

Pretty much what he said. Your only objective is to keep the aggro off the healer. It's the dps duty to manage their threat to stay under yours

If you read the recent announcement, I interpreted that to mean they are restricting the servers to one layer, which means 1x session capacity.  Say a server has 2 80% full layers.  Come Tuesday there's gonna be 60% of that servers pop sitting in a queue.
---
They did fix that by adding rating requirements.
---
Bad idea IMO, now he'll just be back for the next few days still trying to get it. Killing him THE PLAYER is one thing, but killing BT just screws you both over.
---
It's literally what they said.
---
This. My Druid buddy took all the adds and it made the whole event a joke. Never potted, no oils, no consumables except for night fin soup.
---
The thing is you have to remember it would also be a modern blizzard implementation of BC. BC is my favorite expac, but a TBC locked on patch 2.4 leading to joke heroics, joke t4, extremely easy t5 and the same stale arena meta for however many years it goes for? No thanks.
---
But that doesn't fix the problem with queue times which is the whole purpose of free transfers lol
---
Uhm, these transfers have been up for weeks already. When people come flooding back to the game for p2 and all the layers the queues are going to be massive, except on the servers they are offering transfers TO.
---
So yeah if you want to force people to sit in queue for hours just so you'll have a constant stream of victims to gank then that's on you. Thankfully Blizzard are thinking about the gameplay experience of all their subscribers, it's not just about you.
---
Nice! I did something similar. I like that graveyard spot because it's hard to see you on the low ground and it's closer to two of the three spawn points than the super high cliff area near the west-most spawn by the dwarves. A few hours in to scanning, a skull level night elf hunter beat me there with his mount (I was lvl 37) and I was hopeless to stop him. So I let him have it, wrote the timer down, came back in 6 hours sharp, and whaddaya know who do I find patrolling the north spawn point 6 hrs and 7 minutes later... Mr Cat himself, all free and ready to tame.
---
Did you read my earlier comment?  It's because the queue is tied to you as a logged in session not your character select. 
---
In order for factions to have separate queue, we would need the queue to apply as you select a character
---

---
&gt;making gameplay decisions based solely as a short term shareholder-facing talking point.
---
Define "solely"
---
Leave! It is the best thing I have done. I was getting severely burnt out as Ally on Herod. Swapped, and the game is great again! No more 5v1 everywhere you go.
---
Yeah, you've pretty much proven yourself to be that. The **client** is 1.12.x. This was available freely to anyone who played Vanilla and was reuploaded all over the place. It was released by Blizzard. To connect to a private server, all one has to do is change the connection info. The **server database** was **not** available to the public and is a homebrew creation. Go read up on what the term client and server mean..
---
My brothers and I started playing wow on the Gurubashi server in 06 but by the time we got to 60 the game was in TBC pre-patch so we never really got to raid. For Classic, we rolled on Grobbulus, started our own raid guild and two nights ago we crafted the server second Sulfuras (first shaman) with the help of our awesome guildies.
---
At the same time, I don't want to spend forever in the same zone.  Give me the option to dump some quests, if I'm high enough, so I can move on.
---
I'd argue that was a separation that very much needed to happen. I love the world, RPG and PvP aspects of WoW but have virtually no interest in raiding. Which was perfectly fine until raiders (many of whom, judging by how they played, had never done PvP before) starting waltzing into BGs and roflstomping everyone due solely to the superiority of their gear. And the only way we could hope to compete with them was to dive into a side of the game that made the whole thing feel like work to me.

In Classic, if you want to get better at PvE, you do PvE content. If you want to get better at PvP... you do PvE content. Resilience wasn't perfect, but it made sense in that respect and gave those of us for whom raiding holds no real appeal (which, I won't pull numbers out of my ass, but I have to imagine that's a not-insubstantial portion of players) a way to progress in a completely different type of content we do enjoy.
---
Wow classic+=world of diablo expansion. I'll be honest, I just want to sinister strike with warts leg.
---
I don't think this is exactly representative of the issue.   It's more like:
---
1. You have 2 tortillas, 24lbs of chili, and 25lbs of cheese.  Everyone emphatically tells you that you don't have enough tortilla's but you push forward anyway.
---
2. You decide to let the chili and cheese pick where they want to go.
---
3. You quickly realize that 2 tortilla's is not enough so you add 2 more tortilla's and ask everyone again to pick where they want to go
---
4. You fold up the burritos.
---
5. Everything is overflowing so you repeat steps 3. and 4.  7 more times.
---
6.  Tortilla's 1-5 are still overflowing with chili and cheese,  its getting everywhere.
---
7.  You repeat Step 3 again but ask the chili and cheese that have already been in a folded burrito for quite some time if they'd like to move to some of the brand new tortillas you just bought.
---
8.  Some of the cheese agrees, and all of the cheeses friends agree too.
---
9.  Burrito's 1-5 are still overflowing but now they have 20% chili and 80% chese or vice versa.
---
10.  Now there are Several dozen burritos, miraculously and by pure accident a few of them actually have an even amount of chili and cheese.  The rest are *disgusting*.
---
11.  You ask some of the chili and cheese again if they want to move.
---
I see lots of posts on this topic are being downvoted :(
---
Finally a true wow killer
---
Fury Prot is garbage for tanking unless you have 1k AP unbuffed.  That said, it’s unlikely you’ll be tanking unless you’re running the pug, so being ghetto fury will at least let you beat the tank for DPS.
---
&gt; those who complain about the imbalance while sitting on a server that offers free transfers only have themselves to blame
---
bullshit. several of the transfer destinations are DEAD period without even taking balance into account, no one should be going to them unless they are merged. Heartseeker vs Earthfury (which are the only options if one wants to stay EST and get out of Faerlina Herod etc) is a literal joke. why is heartseeker still accepting Alliance which is already 90% of the pop while earthfury is 1/2 heartseeker's size with plenty of room for alliance?
---
The fact that Blizz went waaaaay out of their way to break the classic census mod (and websites) when census was working through every day of WoW's existence and is currently working perfectly fine on retail really says everything we need to know about their approach to "fixing" these very real problems.
---
Finally they had a PERFECT chance to make this work right from the start, based on years of previous experience, and completely blew it. wildly missing the launch numbers then dripping new servers randomly here and there, then announcing transfers in the middle of work days with two hour notice so players missed reserving names.... SHITSHOW
---
He’s not wrong. I don’t know how people thought the two were unrelated
---
And in TBC you HAD to raid if you wanted the best pvp gear.
---
Yes resilience gear was available but it wasn’t the best piece in every slot. WOTLK was the same, most arena players were running about 50% pve gear just like tbc.
---
I mean it’s pretty situational but I guess I would use it for Cold Blood in PVE and would save it for defensive spells in PVP.
---
Why are you linking a census that’s nearly 2 months old, what world do you guys live in where you think that would still be relevant?
---
I cant speak for everyone, but if I had a choice between rolling horde on a server that was 60/40 H to A or 45/55 H/A with equal overall populations, id pick the 45. But sadly that was never an option. We picked Herod because it sounded cool. We didnt leave because we feared the inevitable total population decline on a medium pop would be worse than que times during high activity. If blizzard added ANY kind of indicator even not explicitly stating the faction balance during the early character pre-launch phase, we wouldnt be having this conversation.
---
As i said in a different comment, we are eating shit and asking for seconds because classic is so damn enticing, but blizzard is shitting on us with how they handled the launch (remember like 10 total realms for the whole world? lol) and the transfers now
---
I mean wisdom only makes sense if he's letting mana regen during a fight. If he's spamming shit stopping regen then he only gets benefit from it in between pulls. And in that case if there are other people drinking then he might as well just do the same and get kings instead
---
But there os 171 Armor difference between this and Cloak of Warding.
---
hahahahaha wow. really pulling out all the stops for this one arent ya.. hahahahhaa
---
The thing with a relaunch is keeping the stuff people accumulated over time... If you decide to wipe the slate, that will piss off people!
---
I'm eager to see where they might be going with this, the leveling changes in SL seems to try to resolve some of the concerns for new players (too much content to get "started"...)
---
Classic did kind of put the nail in the coffin over my desire to keeping trying to play retail.  I've gone back a few times, enjoyed some aspects.  It never captured my heart though like it did back in Wrath and BC, and the azerite thing downright left me so frustrated I'm not sure I was ever going to go back anyway.
---
North? That guy is for the birds.
---
Lmao. How long till all the people who join PvP servers to "mostly pve" transfer?
---
Alliance gets lore and detailed questing.
---
Horde gets tons of quest hubs to kill turtles.
---
Can't have them both.
---
We’Re A gOoD cOmPaNy
---
Grats underbite.
---
Fuck the lore, go all in on gameplay mechanics and do whatever it takes to get there. The lore is a sideshow, it has zero effect on your subscription.
---
I've never heard one person say they want an advantage, pretty sure you just pulled that out of your ass.
---
Most people just want balance. They also don't want to be significantly outnumbered because it makes open world gameplay completely miserable.
---
I think he is strictly the best straight DPS pet because he procs frenzy  (gain 30% attack speed for 8 sec after critting) the most (with his 1.0 base attack speed). He's also nice vs casters because that attack speed causes even more push back.
---
What's the point of opening the transfer if nobody would opt into them anyway.  It would be one giant no-op
---
Dire maul east. You jump down a number of areas to avoid fights. You kill 3 bosses and get herbs as well as rich thorium veins at the end. Weapons can vendor for 4-5g a piece and if you get 1-2  a run youre in great shape. Essence of water drops sometimes and sells for over 20g on my server.
---
Join [Fight Club's discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/RbCZJtw), and check out their resources.  They are the Elitist Jerks for classic warriors.
---
Your post confirms exactly what I have said, yet you're apparently just too ignorant of how the internet works to understand that...
---
We need to encourage blizzard to work with the community to come up with SOME kind of balance plan.  Once all the PVE is on a farm, the only real endgame for classic wow is pvp- even if you're on a pve server.  They need to come up with a long term sustainable solution for balancing faction numbers.
---
Haha gay bad epic lulz
---
I didn't like that PvP "Resilience" stat or whatever it was called either. I kinda liked the idea of PvP'ing with PvE gear
---
I won’t have too much of a problem doing the actual tanking (tanked in every expansion since Vanilla) but a quick google search gave me some great tab targeting auto attack macros.
---
Thanks, I’ll throw these in to my rotation for sure
---
Good catch but isn't he a Boss that you kill? Can he also somehow buff you?
---
Winterspring mount, get a life
---
He shadowbolts and heals before the enrage too.  His enrage is just for a lot more damage and faster.  I didn't mean to sound like he doesn't do it before then.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
Just checked and apparently they really went back on the decision to change the story.
---
The more you know.
---
I don't really buy their explanation of "it definitely wasn't because Reforged is too much work already without doing that" but whatever.
---
Mage/Priest from gear,
---
Hes in Arcanist in the last photo and shes got proph and truefaith.
---
Is it though?
---
It's not the hordes fault either.  Many of them want server balance as much as we do.
---
What fun is rolling a pvp server when there is no one to pvp with.
---
Hi just curious what all your guild rewards EP for?
---
There are lots of things about TBC that I hated - dailies, Outland, level 70, and flying mounts. They sucked.
---
Classic+ is the way to go! Go back and fully complete zones, add new lower-level dungeons to refresh the leveling experience, add more world raid bosses, make some interesting world PvP events and new raids, and add harder dungeons aimed at raid-geared players with rewards that aren't all gear based. Give us some more stuff to do that sticks to the Classic vision and don't cater to convenience! I'm probably echoing what so many others have said, but if TBC is the natural progression for Classic, then I guess my Classic and WoW experience will die at the end of Phase 6.
---
Classic+ should avoid new continents, level caps, and anything that drastically shifts the balance of the game. I agree that Blizzard should take this as an opportunity to take the game in a different direction than expansions like TBC and WOTLK took it. I still played and enjoyed those expansions, but you can see the makings of a philosophy that prioritized the casual player base in those expansions.
---
So arms/prot should just be the way I go?
---
Same in French and almost the same in portuguese.
---
That’s just not true.
---
I WAS a top arena player, and I was ALWAYS wearing multiple pieces of pve gear, roughly half my gear even. Most high-end arena players ran with lots of pve gear. I mean, depending on your class you could even wear nearly full pve gear.
---
Resilience is just a stat, saying it helped kill wpvp is such a massive reach.
---
Thank you both
---
“Hope blizzard has a good solution” LOL. Do you also still believe in Santa?
---
I have a cancel macro bound to my sunder armor. He's an idiot.
---
Hunters: He's a little confused, but he's got the right spirit.
---
Queues in PVP servers should have been faction-specific with an informative message saying what's the estimate queue for both sides. Free transfers should have had faction balance into account.
---
Is this Lucifer?
---
Yeah the announcement is about queues, but the complaint is about faction imbalance.
---
I am on Anathema, and the idea that it is a "dead" server seems way off to me. I'm currently on level 45 and there are tons and tons of people leveling up. I've seen people everywhere and had zero difficulty finding dungeon groups, even for unpopular dungeons. Examples: Ran Uldaman on Wednesday (very unpopular as far as I can tell) and encountered multiple other groups on the way in/out. On Thursday had some WPvP in Tanaris involving around 15 people.
---
The nature of the playerbase on the late-opening servers and the day one megaservers is hugely different. The big servers are full of longtime WoW addicts who wanted to rush to 60. The newer servers are full of people who signed up a couple weeks in or later -- people who hadn't played in ages, people who were new to WoW, people who weren't waiting on opening and signed up AFTER the press coverage about the massive WoW classic launch.
---
It's a different community. In particular, the density of 60s is much lower. The fact that not a lot are raiding yet doesn't mean that nobody's on there, nor does it mean that people won't be raiding in the future.
---
Depends what they are against. If its a clothy i would say rogue. Anything else a warrior. Speaking generally
---
NO CHANGES
---
You can 2 man angerforge with rogues
---
Yeah, if you do a "tribute run" in Dire Maul North, he'll become neutral and you can talk to him to get the buff.
---
Not by design.
---
Because you can double dip to be efficient
---
If you grind your bis while leveling you save time later
---
Neat thought Blizzboy.   So please point me towards Blizzards published realm population info and faction census and demographics so I can make a decision and feel comfortable with it.
---
I really appreciate your help tracking down that link for me.  I'll wait here until you come back with it.
---
Thanks again,
---
I'm ironically too lazy to make the macro for this but manually pet passive &gt; FD &gt; trap works for me every single time. Give it a second after putting your pet on passive as there is a slight delay but I really want to stress that I've been successfully doing this since I started playing lol
---
You probably aren't wrong tough, even though you mis-heard. If they can do Classic stuff in odd years and retail stuff in even years to have a steadier cash flow from the game I think the business side of the company would love that.
---
Man. You people are more delusional than I thought. I'm glad that /r/classicwow isn't actually doing game design.
---
Exactly. Most modern mmos are a joke tbh; what's the point of an mmo if most of the content is single player focused? Literally just make a single player coop game instead or something.
---
My cats! They literally will not stop jumping on my keyboard lol
---
and the hunter wins both.
---
guild stats are on warcraftlogs classic under "progression"
---
you can run the pop stats manually with census addon (don't rely on websites since they are completely inaccurate)
---
agreed
---
What's the chance of having three children who are all daughters? 1 in 8  
---
What's the chance of having another daughter if you already have two daughters? 1 in 2
---
Careful, you might trigger a certain rogue.
---
If it makes you feel better forsaken just tolerate the horde with an alliance tenuous at best... So really you are just RPing your race :)
---
i want TBC, if only 'cuz it comes with Draenei, my favorite race.
---
I think at this phase in the game. 2 weeks is quite some time and would make a big difference, that’s all.
---
are you kidding me right now
---
years of wow progress data says that people want to be on the dominant side, not everyone for sure, but there is a reason why people gravitated to one server or another even given the same time zone and region
---
Warrior is the weakest class alone assuming equal gear. Regardless if it's low, mid or full bis gear.
---
I think like 4 of them are still at Blizzard.
---
Should I switch to a Pickpocket build for 50g over my PvE raid spec I have on right now? Trying to get my epic mount (400g away) is it worth it to switch to pp spec to have less downtime?
---
I mostly don’t like the aesthetics of TBC (too sci-fi) and the fact that it takes you out of the old world instead of just supplementing it with new stuff. I’d rather have hyjal and stuff than outland.
---
I wasn't aware that they were even planning on retconning it, I had to look it up after I commented to double check and learned that they recently announced they weren't retconning it.
---
Thank god, WC3 is the last bastion of good Warcraft lore
---
good job blizzard, you are ruining the game nicely. Now everyone can go BFA!
---
Thats not entirely true, by sixty you've interacted with a lot if major characters. Were not grunts being built at a barracks, we're heroes being called in the altar of storms.
---
Appears to be a lawsuit.  Haha.
---
I used Shadowed Unit Frames.
---
You can just set your configuration for two lines shown and 10 buffs on each line.
---
There are several servers that have been at 1 layer for weeks without any queues,  but are still being allowed free transfers.  That is the issue here.
---
Sounds like a lot of posts on this subreddit.  "I don't play that much or have any idea what i'm talking about but here's a *VERY* strong opinion that I have about it."
---
PvE ≠ raiding.
---
I thoroughly running questing, running dungeons, doing professions, etc. Raiding, however, has never held any real appeal for me, and the few times guildies have gotten me to try it I've been bored to tears.
---
Which is perfectly fine. Not everyone enjoys the same things, and designing the various elements of the game for mass appeal is how we go retail.
---
What's not fine, however, is raiders waltzing into BGs and roflstomping everyone there simply because their gear is so much better, and the rest of us having no recourse but to surrender to raiding ourselves if we actually want to compete with them.
---
Resilience wasn't perfect, but it was a damn sight better than the old system of "If you want to get better at PvE, do PvE. If you want to get better at PvP, do PvE."
---
You have to be willfully ignorant to not know that we can recognize the differences between groups of people on a genetic level.
---
yea spec won't change that scenario
---
The birds?
---
If they have a brain they’ll reply that a classicwow reddit poll skews towards more hardcore players
---
Hey at least they made it themselves, horribly, but points to them for at least doing some work for that ad.
---
The concept if Classic+ is a constantly shifting set of features, so much so that you may want to explain what **Classic+ is to you** first.
---
As soon as TBC is released I quit. I could never stand Blood Elves on Horde. If you want to play a pretty boy play Alliance.
---
Dude you are legit so fucking dumb, you start off by saying the chance it’s closer to 30% when it’s 63% or whatever and you just keeping “it’s not useful to me” like Jesus ur fucking stupid guy.
---
You make me feel.
---
You make me feel like a nurtal troll woman.
---
Poor poor Chromie.
---
Feels like you want WoW 2 rather than classic+
---
Blizzard 👏🏻does 👏🏻not 👏🏻care👏🏻
---
Even if your personal attacks are not directed at me per se and they're directed at someone else or a hypothetical person they still are personal attacks.  I just don't think it lends a lot of credibility to your arguments.
---
If your argument is that you personally do not spend a lot of time on WoW and therefore you personally do not want to see new content at a fast pace, fine.  
---
If your argument is that the game should cater to people who play 10-12 hours a week or less my question would be why?  Don't you think those players will continue to play even if new content is released at a pace faster than they can experience it, at least on average?  
---
If you quit the game because the pvp honor system came out at a time when you are not max level I think you would be in a staunch minority.
---
Clearly
---
This is exactly it.
---
I don't know what people expect. They have the option to move, but it's a community effort. Everyone keeps saying "welllll heartseeker is 90% alliance so I don't wanna end up on the other side of it"
---
Well someone has to
---
All thanks to my guild. I never thought I had the opportunity to ding LVL 60 in MC
---
The main ones are showing up on time and getting raid boss kills. I am there for most of that.
---
However my guild gives suplimental EP for doing things like getting guildies attuned, farming mats for gbank, or just doing 1 dungeon a week with only guild members. I can't keep up with that, so people always have a big edge on me in EP. Always topping out before I do, so they can bid, get an item, and yea I will eventually get one, but not after having mine decay for a few weeks because I couldn't win anything. Overall they will always get more total points to spend on gear than I will because of this. Just feels bad to me.
---
Pvp set is t2 equivalent,  but then you still need rings and trinkets and the other items from pve, and weapons,  and then AQ and Naxx gear is just far superior. Even if someone gets rank 13 you still have plenty of raid gear you want to improve upon.  
---
"You pve to pvp" is true
---
Yea, it's like 3 min from ironforge. Can't fuckin take it anymore
---
If Kaplan is such a genius, why isn't Starcraft fixed, or Warcraft, or WoW, or HotS, Diablo, or Titan or or or...
---
Give the people paid transfers to any server
---
this conversation isn’t going anywhere 🤨
---
You didn’t think you would, but you did.
---
still cant come up with anything original? or are you afraid youll get banned off your social media for talking like the little bitch you are? :)
---
In group PVP with pocket healers, warriors are god tier. Without pocket healers or in 1v1s they’re trash tier. Rogues are sort of the opposite, extremely good in 1v1 but pretty useless in large team fights. Small team fights they can screw a healer which gives them value though
---
I’d rather have classic+ but I know it’s highly unlikely. Besides that I’d want the xpacs without flying mounts and LFG. I know that’s also unlikely.
---
After that I would be okay with the first two xpacs- but not thrilled.
---
wouldn't have been able to cheap shot tho
---
What you're suggesting is not realistic. 
---
Rogue specs vary but for the most part, a rogue is a rogue is a rogue. Same for hunters, same for mages, same for warlocks.
---
You cannot just "creative" your way around the simple fact that gear is either: going to be a sidegrade and no one will want to do the raid, or, it is going to be an upgrade and people will be sitting at literally max stats. 
---
You're talking about "content" but you're ignoring the simple fact that people want to raid new raids and if the new raids are dropping sidegrades they will quit, and if they are huge upgrades, the game will break.
---
You need a stat squish or a level up and you can't say "neither" until you address that problem and stop ignoring it.
---
Blizzard would fuck up Classic+ immediately, case in point; Cataclysm, MoP (in some respects), WoD, Legion (imo) BFA, and probably Shadowlands.
---
meanwhile they are 4g per 1 here
---
Oh boy now we're begging for layering to go into 2020.
---
This subreddit always give me a good laugh.
---
You use it for what you need it for.  Popping it to get another kidney shot would be weird since you probably wouldn't have the points to do much with it.
---
This didn't age well.
---
Also, when asked about customer retention on the call regarding Classic wow, Blizzard basically hardcore dodged the question saying something like "we think of WoW as one community"
---
Neat thought indeed. I don't want 50/50 balance. I want to be on the 60/40 or 70/30 favored side.
---
Yours truly.
---
Nobody can achieve 100% uptime, what are you smoking?
---
Besides, warriors have better uptime because they'll just spam Hamstring every global and they get Flurry on top of that.
---
Charging for TBC or Classic +
---
I'm and undead priest. Looks like youre alliance?
---
Okay first of all, big yikes at your green-fever and "nothing personnel kid" comment; second of all, bear in mind that many of the allies you mention are only present due to Malfurion seeking them out, Cenarius specifically being a [good example] (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Malfurion_Stormrage#War_of_the_Ancients).
---
&gt;"Malfurion...quickly went to seek out the demigod Cenarius."
---
Third, you talk about Chad moves but fail to acknowledge that Malfurion is the original Chad-Daddy who sacrificed his immortality to save the day:
---
&gt;"Even with the help of Cenarius and Alexstrasza the Dragon Queen, Malfurion knew that his people could not stand up to the constant barrage of demonic invaders. Believing the Well of Eternity to be their gateway, Malfurion decided that it must be destroyed. **Knowing that its destruction would render them mortal** and without any magic, the night elves reluctantly agreed to storm Azshara's stronghold and bring an end to the invasion."
---
Hell, he even got betrayed by his own brother who gave his enemies a warning and due to that he decided to attack sooner:
---
&gt;"However, Illidan, spurred by his addiction to magic and his frustrated love for Tyrande, refused to give up his power, and left their resistance to warn the Highborne. Knowing that Illidan would quickly reach them, Malfurion attacked immediately to retain some surprise."
---
Fourth, they still almost lose but Malfurion himself comes in to save the day (real talk: this is the "near single-handedly" I referred to earlier, and my question was only rhetorical, but you seem to have gotten awfully defensive about some dude on green-bean cans):
---
&gt;"Azshara and her highborne were prepared for them, and her chaotic magics ripped Malfurion's forces to shreds. But it was the sight of Tyrande falling to the hands of Azshara's former Highborne, now transformed into satyrs that gave **Malfurion the strength for one final strike**."
---
In case that wasn't enough for you to stop metaphorically drooling over thrall like he literally drools over everything, here is more proof that Malfurion was largely the singular entity responsible for saving Azeroth in the War of the Ancients. He traps Sargeras himself:
---
&gt;"**Malfurion cast a spell to create a gigantic gale that would rip all the demons from the ground and send them on a one-way trip into the Well and to the Twisting Nether.** ...Although Sargeras knew that the portal was closing, he tried to do the unthinkable - step into the portal to recreate it and enter Azeroth. **The portal finally collapsed and trapped Sargeras in it.**"
---
Then we have Thrall, who has...ran away from home literally like three times now lul. There's also some shit that went down between Malfurion and the old gods iirc but I don't care about trolling you enough to read more than one wiki page.
---
When I run with friends they know I'll handle any mob I pull off them and they just let me be I'll eventually bring it back to a tank, kill it, or it will be sitting in a freezing trap while we kill everything else.  Hunters have so many good utilities to help groups.
---
Like I get that some players aren't interested in learning how to play the utility side of thier class and just want to pew pew, but feign death aggro drop is some pretty basic stuff.  I'm really floored at how hunters get a bad name.
---
Yeah, their announcement of the change made a ton of sense too. Their argument was that, currently, you only got to play through like 2-3 zones in each expansion, then you hopped over to the next without finishing off the story. They wanted to adjust that so you played through an entire expansion, but obviously didn't want to make players go through *all* of them.
---
All the non-current expansions are still going to feel super empty, but I really don't think there's anything to be done about that.
---
Grandmarshal, backpedaling and clicking. How things have changed.
---
Where do you get that information? I think they’re gonna force everyone into tbc.
---
I've had to explain this to about half the priests I've grouped with. Somehow I'm always surprised when it happen, but I guess it's just natural to do because that's what you'd probably do while soloing. Anyways you're not alone.
---
Oh, except pallies, feel free to shield them all you want, though to be fair shield is terribly mana inefficient.
---
Agreed.
---
&gt;  I don't want to wait 20 sec for you to stack sunder 
---
I don't want to wait 20 sec for the healer to drink between every single pull cause they go oom trying to heal an arms warrior doing his best tank impression. 
---
I don't want to wait 10 minutes for everyone to corpse run every time some dumb fuck DPS face pulls and the faux-tank dies cause he has no mitigation.
---
I don't want to be the "you should go play retail guy" but if you want to perpetuate poor habits of DPS, and execute strats that feel 'fast paced' but lead to less efficient, overall slower, and frustrating dungeon clears, then you should go play retail.
---
All i read was “I forgot but you shoulda known even tho I didn’t say it”
---
Oh, Fair nuff, I looked at that list and it looked like it was 100% of the layered realms.
---
Maybe the Hordelets should transfer then.
---
All the comments on this topic basically amount to Horde players bemoaning the fact that they won't have as many people to 5v1. The world's smallest violin is playing.
---
Quite a few people have reported not getting the buff near the flightmaster or while in the flightmaster tower.  More have reported that they have not gotten the buff while inside the auction house.  My suggestion is to stay outside between the bank and auction house to ensure it isn't terrain based.
---
Holla holla grind dollars!
---
As others have said, if you're not sure if/when to switch to fury tank build you probably don't need to. It is a niche spec and honestly has limited advantages. Deep prot in the last grind from 55-60 is really best if you plan on dungeon crawling. An arms/prot spec isnt bad either, but is a bit harder to play and still only show minimal gains. Sweeping strike + WW with a slow two hand can help with AoE trash groups, but that's really the only benefit. Also being deep prot helps mitigate lower gear/level while grinding dungeons for xp and gear. 
---
On a side note, I'm happy to see the arms love being shown in this thread. Arms/prot is my favorite spec overall, even though I'm deep prot atm as well. I wrote an analysis of arms and fury tanking a while back when fury tanking was still the band wagon and it got downvoted and flamed to hell by fury tards. Glad to see other people have done independent testing and came to similar conclusions.
---
I kinda hope they dont have to chose just one patch to base the xpac off if they do BC/Wrath.  Hopefully going forward they have backups of the other patches to reference and maybe we can get things like major talent updates, etc with each phase/raid tier?
---
I seem to remember DKs changing a toooon throughout Wrath, it'd be weird for them to just use the 3.3.5 (or w/e it was) patch version of them.
---
Sword and shield or dual or 2H?
---
Indeed. And there is more genetic variation between various groups of Africans than there is between all the other 'races' combined. Funny how science doesn't align with your superficial social construct, ain't it?

Tanks are the backbone to any guild, most people decide which raiding guild they want to join based off 2 things, raid schedule and the quality of the tanks.
---
Mythic + was a cool system, but it’s design philosophy is inherently different than classics
---
RIP that first Tuesday raid after patch day
---
No, the annoying little dipshit is the one gorilla that spawns in the middle of the main road in STV.
---
I call him Steve. Steve is a dick.
---
Just depends on situation. This morning I was doing 5m DME jumps. 2 war, warlock, Hunter, me healing. I kept mp5 on the Hunter and warlock and we never had any downtime due to drinking. They never drank and I myself would only sit to drink at the start of each boss pull and then stand up a few seconds into each fight. No issues and we kept a good pace.
---
Works perfect b/c they already blinked to disengage, Blink will be on CD.  Unless there saving Blink just for the chance of being stunned by a SP (highly unlikely), but if they are then there in range of shadow spells so doesn't help them.
---
Well, that’s an answer from someone that’s not creative, my participation here is over.
---
I see, don't think you can hold your own.  That's cool though,  good thing you're coming back with that link so you can make a decision to find that favorable server with data from Blizzard.
---
If blizzard allows alliance transfers to heartseeker it'll be 9:1 and it'll die shortly after. Hopefully blizzard decides to not fuck this up.
---
And enhancement shaman won't be doing enough dps even in full dps gear to make up for the dps lost on the warrior group. If the enhancement shaman in your group insists on going pure dps despite not having stormstrike, then your raid is better off bringing a 2h fury orc warrior instead and giving him Nightfall and putting a resto shaman in your warrior group
---
Aap and the speed runners swear questing is the fastest but I’m with you, tank dungeon grinding feels the fastest, to me at least.
---
First 1,000,000/(1/10) is 10,000,000.
---
Second, it's not 1,000,00, it's 0.000001
---
The ranged thing is really important. I've met a lot of mages that will stand in melee range throwing frost bolts, thinking it's no different than being at range. Ignoring cleaves and other obvious reasons to stay out of melee, they actually can pull threat easier because they are within a certain range of the target and so only have to meet the 110% threshold instead of 130%.
---
No, it does. That's the psuedoscience you are pushing.

---
Unless they are a pally they need damage for rage.
---
If you have fast ques, yes, otherwise no.
---
Only with a healer. Which splits the gold in half. And only a specific type of dm farm called a 'dm jump run'. You can find a how to from skarmtank on YouTube
---
I came here to say this.  If you are 53 and you have level 60s in your group, swapping from prot to arms/fury is going to do fuck-all for your chance to hold threat, it will just burn through healer mana faster.
---
lol what the fuck
---
&gt;Pvp set is t2 equivalent
---
Stat wise PvP gear is closer to 2.5 but the big benefit is that the stats are itemized *much* better, particularly for DPS specs.  Tier sets are particularly bad for hybrid classes unless you want to heal
---
You can sinister strike and slice and dice with a dagger...
---
TBC was the absolute best version of wow imho I would absolutely love if they made TBC
---
Is this about classic wow?
---
This but with farming dme for lionheart helm mats
---
I’m hoping for classic+ in order to keep the game alive. If they do TBC will they do Wrath after that? Many people consider Wrath to be the pinnacle of WoW, but others consider it to be the beginning of the end in terms of daily quests, etc.
---
Assume they do TBC and/or Wrath, surely they won’t do Cata? So will we have TBC+ or Wrath+? Releasing more expansions just delays the issue.
---
&gt; Burrito's 1-5 are still overflowing but now they have 20% chili and 80% chese or vice versa.
---
The vast majority of PvP realms are horde-dominant. You're making it sound like a 50/50 split. That's incorrect.
---
Yeah honestly not even reading that, sorry treehugger, get burnt.
---
That same argument was used when the transfers to Heartseeker were opened up and its turned out to be complete bullshit.  They are leaving it open to alliance transfers because the game will be unplayable on those servers for 1000s of people due to que times and the horde simply refusing to move.  They will lose subs from both sides more rapidly from que times rather than server imbalance because a healthy percent of the population doesn't have time to come home from work and sit in line with the hopes that they can play in that small of a window that they are allowed online.  You can call them dead all you want but the cause of that is because you would rather sit in line to play and be guaranteed a population advantage rather than start moving in mass and contribute to the population of a destination server. Heartseeker is the perfect example of just how fast the server can go from "new" to "high" with the coordination of a few large guilds.  Unfortunately for the overpopulated and destination servers, it seems that only the alliance characters are motivated to do so.
---
Wow classic is old fucking garbage that is only passable for a 2004 game.
---
Where can I as a first time ally learn about onyxias time in stormwind? Ony pre?
---
it could cause a faction imbalance, absolutely.  But their goal here is to distribute total population more evenly amongst the servers.  Which free transfers from high -&gt; low pop servers would accomplish.
---
Faction specific transfers does next to nothing in faction balance and total distribution.
---
I fucking hated cata lol - I would be so sad if classic died for cata to happen again :(
---
wow crazy you sim higher in dagger spec with daggers
---
Why would you not have your hunters give Trueshot Aura to your melees?
---
Sounds like you didnt spent ur time researching pre classic launch which you had plenty of time for. ;)
---
The transfer servers are just as ally dominated, no sides wants to be overmanned and absolutely no side wants to be undermanned. Also the guy in the video is playing ally btw.
---
Hammer of Wrath technically provides an execute phase damage boost but not as much as warriors.
---
Save it for the oh shit moments, and use it on big cd's as mentioned, if you want bigger value from prep try to reset more cd's than one
---
Viskag, Deathbringer, Brutality Blade are all worth breaking the set for. If you are human then scratch Deathbringer. If you are Orc then prioritize Deathbringer but even Viskag and Brutality Blade will be upgrades over Dal Rends.
---
You're getting two items confused
---
There's the Tranquil Mechanical Yeti and the Mechanic Yeti. The latter is a 5 (10?) Use item you get from the quest. The former is a craftable item
---
Except when cloth is shadowpriest. Or warlock if you're not UD.
---
Mad because illiterate, just like Thrall.
---
Using a 2hander and popping sweeping strikes, even if only to get a quick threat lead and immediately slap on a shield afterwards is far better than going deep prot. There's really no room for discussion unless you're planning to use a bunch of thorns effects and engineering to pull threat as prot.
---
Well as a boss, I was the one who's idea it was, to expand and change the game. Can't put the blame on the employees for that. At the end of the day I'd be happy if I make a new product, people buy it but complain that they want the old one back. I release the old one and get tons of sales, while the "new" product still sells. Win win for me.
---
this is the aspect of Classic that truly sets it apart from Retail!
---
I just want WoW without micro-transactions, transmog, LFG and dungeon difficulties.
---
No need to merge servers when you can allow players to freely migrate to them.
---
TBC is going to be a 100% success, classic+ could easily be ruined.
---
TBC will bring a lot more players back in my opinion due to rated arena, pvp vendors, rating requirements for pvp gear.
---
TBC has a lot more class balance, a lot of good raids, and dungeons too.
---
Whereas classic+ the classes will be overpowered from gear inflation, and you can never trust Blizzard to do it right, if there even is a right way to do classic+,.
---
Overall as a pvper myself, I would much prefer TBC, I've been sticking to classic as much as I can at the moment but I'm not really looking forward to phase 2 as the world pvp isn't going to be very fun in my opinion, but the thought of TBC in the future keeps me going.
---
Rogue. Warrior just gets frost novaed once and then 2 shot
---
I love the idea of classic+ but have absolutely 0 trust it will be implemented well so I'm team TBC.
---
I'm happy with either TBC or Classic+ as long as they keep the existing Classic servers separated, and create fresh servers for the expansions.

I hope Tauren can be Tauren. Would like to play a Tauren Tauren.
---
I agree with you sounds super shitty you should put them on blast. The worst ninjas are the ones who knowingly intentionally don't post that their runs have reserves because they no one will join, then pretend that they forgot to post when it's already too late.
---
Don't believe for a second it was an 'accident.' These guys knew what they were doing from the start, which is why they needed PUGs for Onyxia, which my guild downed with 27 people.
---
Goes both ways mate.
---
Devils advocate argument - but why would blizzard invest the time and resources into fixing server infrastructure when they can eliminate the problem entirely with BGs?  They will likely just release WSG/AV in early January and call it a day with WPvPers. 
---
We really feel like just an annoyance to them I guess.  Better to gimp wpvp and negate the real problem until the the patch that "invalidates" wpvp comes along and then everyone forgets and is happy?
---
Bitch I will, and I'll wear that dress with pride as a holy paladin. Big talk for someone whose biggest hero runs away from home every time things get too hard, though. I'm guessing you follow in Thrall's footsteps being all bark and no bite, but the bark ain't even Bark*skin* like milf-banging-malf has.
---
And if it's the largest increase in raw numbers, it's somewhere above the 2.5M subs gained at WoD launch.
---
I was pretty pissed. I clearly had the game. If it were me coming up on another hunter I wouldn’t have messed with him. It’s like the Rohk quest. I don’t gank the Orc trying to do his demon because I’m not a cunt. 
---
...I’m a *dick* because I kill the Orc while he’s doing other innocuous stuff.  :)
---
I think you're absolutely right. 
---
They're going to bring retail back in line with what we all miss from classic. See the changes with Shadow lands in the form of level crunching. This is how they will inevitably try to bring classic players back into the retail fold.
---
It doesn't make good business sense to maintain two versions of the same game. They will try to condense the player base.
---
Mtx is usually driven by a few whales rather than the playerbase as a whole though.  3milx12-15$/mo is a whole lot of gtd money
---
Pretty sure that’s against TOS. If not stated in the LF message then they can’t keep or it’s against TOS. Not taking anyone side but based upon him admitting he forgot seems pretty clear cut to me. Off the top of my head, without looking it up, pretty sure I’ve read repeatedly that if the reserve is not stated at the beginning then it’s against tos.
---
You say that, but last MC run was rogue night...we had 4 in raid and think all got one piece and one got 3.
---
Locs are t1 gold farmers
---
Around 400+ in pre-bis.  Almost 700 in BiS BiS.
---
It’s a silly conspiracy theory, has nothing to do with balance. He’s trying to claim they want to spread the population out thin but that makes no sense because the xfers are going TO lower pop realms. Yes some of them are from very low pop realms, probably to give people a chance to get out of that hell.
---
Gonna delete your account for good my dude?
---
I definitely want Classic+
---
I distinctly remember liking BC a lot more than Vanilla. So I personally am hoping for just BC servers. I want Arena PLZPLZPLZ
---
Honestly I don’t remember. It wasn’t just a forum post, it was like one of those ign websites or something. Was a speculation based on “anonymous sources/insider info” so it’s to be taken with a grain of salt of course. 
---
If they force everyone into tbc I hope at least there will be fresh servers. I don’t really want my tbc experience to start with all those hardcore progressionists launching off at 60 in full tier sets from classic. I liked the way it built up in classic.
---
So the company can expand and create more great games?
---
Wat? I was wrong about the original math, but were talking about what it means, not the actual number.
---
This is why Dal Rends is overrated. In most cases it takes way less time to buy a Krol Blade. One you get Viskag or Brutality Blade you won't be using either Dal Rends since Myrah's Song will be your OH until you get both raid swords
---
Put a queue on the dominant faction while offering free faction Xfers until the population is withing say 5% of each other or whatever.
---
I would say no. I spec for COC, and Flamestrike.
---
But once you learn to play around their ranges and with the leeway it is much faster.
---
People don't want to be in the dominant side, they just REALLY don't want to be on the non-dominant side.
---
Interesting bit about the 5-set being buggy. I found that if you send your pet without attacking any of the bosses and then set it to passive you should have a successful pull.
---
Point is if you take all the PVP servers and mash them together and find that there are more Horde than Alliance, there is no way to make all the servers balanced.
---
Horde simply outnumber the Alliance. Whether that's cause faction loyalty or cause PVP players want ezmode racials is largely irrelevant.
---
If you want faction balance but nobody wants to play on the Alliance instead of Horde then yeah, you're kinda fucked.
---
I for one cant wait for ez ranking on a Horde dominated server. Since we are the underdogs we will get to choose engagements in groups vs the mad bands of Horde searching desperately for an Ally to kill, only to find our pack instead.
---
I wish that was me. We run 10 warriors and 7 rogues.
---
Ur wrong but ok
---
Frostadamus did a good video on this.
---
TOS does not stop ninja looters from ninja looting...
---
Well, I just watched that in its entirety.
---
Think I'm gonna take acid after work to wash off the stink lol
---
*merrrrrrmaid*
---
The best part is people who have this attitude are still full on 60 in classic and complaining about how gankers here are just assholes "who couldn't make it in real competitive "retail PvP"
---
I feel like mages have the most competition for gear.
---
It is preying on classic wow's hype though
---
Why do you spend so much time on a sub for a game you hate lmao
---
When is Blizzard opening paid transfers?
---
I was a multi-glad in BC/Wrath as well and I honestly prefer the long games. I liked timing my CDs with the enemies CDS and finding that small window of opportunity to try and blow up an enemy while their teammate is CC'd. Much more so than current Classic PvP where I can just nuke a target in a 3 second stun. Additionally, long games seemed like it only pertained to 2v2. Never had a 3v3 game last longer than 10 minutes. 
---
&gt;It also made it nearly impossible to progress because one bad loss might take 7+ hours of arena to bounce back from.
---
That has more to do the matchmaking system / queues matching you with teams lower than you, than it does with resilience.
---
I use shift 1-&gt;= for my mouse buttons. they're probably doing the same thing
---
Poor indie company Blizzard can't afford to make good games anymore.
---
You all have gmail right?
---
If you choose to increase your playtime by a whole day just because you don't want to play effectively, that's your choice.
---
The chances that it would be a picture of a screen instead of a screenshot? Very high on this sub.
---
No I didn't.  You inferred that.  I did not imply that.
---
Nor do I care about a light imbalance like the overall population on PVP servers of ~ 60:40.   It's not my fault the alliance is filled with carebears.
---
But perhaps if blizzard would make population or faction ratio data available, and in the worst cases limit transfers based on faction,  the problem might be able to be corrected and balanced back out.
---
Same. Played in TBC and WoTLK. Been playing WoTLK private server casually in my hiatus, Classic wow is the shiz! The player interaction and community cannot be beat!
---
&gt;milf-banging-malf has.
---
Malf withers like a syphilitic schlong if Tyrande hasn't texted him back in 30 seconds.
---
Chad Green Jesus tells the rest of the horde to sort shit out for themselves because he's done taking care of their asses and they need to grow the fuck up.
---
Classic+ is a nice idea, but naxx gear is already so powerful that further progression in the lvl 60 space just doesn't make sense.  Sidegrade progression isn't going to keep many people interested for very long.
---
That aside, putting faith in current-day blizz for new content is spotty at best.  Classic works because it's a 14 year old game that many of us enjoyed, and blizz didn't have to really *create* anything to make it happen.
---
Yeah TBC (altered) would be amazing. Remove flying (aka they need to do some changes to the world), no shared city, no resillience (balance out arena gear) etc.
---
Shoulda just rolled PvE in the first place
---
played a rogue in vanilla and playing it again now
---
i have had none of the issues people bitch about :/
---
Not mad, disappointed
---
Parental guilt leveling right there....
---
Before tbc dropped they did the same thing. Opened free transfers to other servers and let the players decide to move.. until they didn’t and blizzard threatened to move us themselves if we didn’t move. That got people to finally transfer. Blizzard was smart enough to include the fact that if you got force moved there would be no guarantee your friends would be with you.
---
Then why do so many people play it? Seems like it is passable for a good game even in the year 2019, hence the huge playerbase. Wildstar was dead on arrival lol.
---
The fact that there are no flight points, no vendors, no quests make this zone amazingly creepy.
---
My AoE can’t target individual mobs
---
Enhancement shamans back in vanilla were known to have to biggest hard drive space as they had to record 15 hours of gameplay for their 10 minute PvP montage. They had to cut out all the footage of them running after enemies, awkwardly swinging at them in hope for the proc only to get kited again. And that was before Winfury was fixed so it couldn't procc off itself anymore. There are still people that believe enhancements will be of any threat to anyone in 1.12 but those are the same ones that fell for World of Roguecraft.
---
Not a WoW player here: I just want to do my dailies on Quel'Thalas without a thought in my mind. If I can do that once a day for the rest of my life, I'm golden.
---
Compelling stuff here
---
1. I believe they do about 20%-30% less than the top 3. Which puts them right above tanks and other specs limited by spell resistance/immunities (ie fire elementals immune to fire dmg)
---
2. You should have enough spell crit and dmg to just work with what you got. As holy you'll have holy shock and judgement. Feel blessed, because ret doesnt.
---
PvP is fun, 1v3 is not. Pretty simple.
---
Question about these. Am i able to use multiple free transfers on a realm? Also am i able to transfer from a east coast server to west coast? Any insight would be great, thanks all.
---
Oof someone got rekt in wotlk
---
Where do they make people like you?
---
I just wish I could transfer to any different realm of my choice at least once.
---
Ive been in similar positions man, hit me up in DM's if you ever want help figuring things out to do together online. My partner and I spent a lot of time finding things to feel closer while being apart for months and months.
---
Massive dopemine hit lol
---
Stalagg horde here, I like to roam the world on my mount instead of FP at times when bored and I barely see *any* alliance out there.
---
It's.... worrisome for phase 2.
---
There was a game like this that blizzard sued and it got shut down, same thing will happen here. Anyone who sees that on a game that plays wow would chuckle and walk away, for the most part. Though I appreciate the humor here just giving you a hard time
---
1/3 it seems
---
Have you tried /world?
---
Wild star was not very good. You may have liked it more but that doesn’t make it better. People like wow for different reasons. Not everyone is looking for the newest turbo nerd golden treadmill. A lot of people just like the older style of RPG. Just because you don’t think it’s good doesn’t mean it’s shit. What a sad life you must live if everyone who has a different opinion is an “addict”
---
That's how we roll here. He has the kid, he should know those tactics.
---
Do remember that the game is baked into the retail client, they could still incorporate talent tree changes, arena, etc without necessarily committing completely to TBC.
---
Faction transfers would at least be a start, because that's the only way they can potentially get large numbers of horde to play alliance. Might be too late though for the same reason its only seemingly alliance leaving horde favored servers while all the horde want to stay put (horde could just as easily all transfer to Heartseeker and create a balanced server btw...).
---
Someone wasn't elite enough to go to [Top Gun](https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=115589).
---
Daring and creative as well.
---
You know what they say about horses and water
---
Have fun with the server imbalance, sucks to be you.
---
The issue is, 
---
In generally if I am not mistaking in U.S.E. atm, there are more horde players overall than alliance.
---
If I am also no mistaking, doing this might actually fuck other servers drastically as you might have picked a server specifically for this imbalance, which will be changed. Can they be unchanged back?
---
I am okay with TBC, some of the classes I like playing get a lot better in TBC. With that being said, I would be equally happy with Classic+ , the more WoW the better.
---
Sure, yea, i'll pay you 20g after we finish the run.... (&gt;.&gt;)
---
Well the point is that by fixing the queue issues in this way, you inadvertently give people the means to "solve" their faction not being great problem.
---
Hundreds of thousands of people rolling on shit every day. It probably happens every day.
---
Any ranged DPS on my server can pick whatever dungeon group they want with no queue.
---
Rogues can't even get into the groups.
---
I know lmao i'm just tryna justify my shitpost
---
&gt;Pretty sure that’s against TOS. If not stated in the LF message then they can’t keep or it’s against TOS.
---
Ninja looting isn't against TOS. Changing the loot rules, that have been stated, is
---
They have a solution in retail it's just a very shitty solution that makes people not like the game. Layers suck
---
No, I think every player should move around to make the servers as imbalanced as possible.  Force Blizzard to acknowledge the problem and present a solution.
---
Playing rogue correctly can win dmg meters overall is satisfying. Suggest making your own grps to reserve items for urself. I farmed LBRS for few items and geeting UBRS key. Then making my own pug for jed/rend runs quite easy (reserving only MH only) once you get decent gear the rotation if played correctly is fun. Combines with some buffs like wf or bshout its fun to push high numbers.
---
I agree that a lot of those talents are hugely valuable, but outside healing Focus for two points the rest of them you are only going to get one of those talents if you are pre-40.
---
Why do you think it should be catered to the people who play all day every day? Literally everything you try to argue can be argued in the opposite.
---
Why do you say that? I've never been beaten in overall damage or interupts in a dungeon.  
---
In my experience tanks love a rogue who does good damage without pulling threat and interupts/stuns whenever it's helpful
---
I find this statement truthful.
---
I agree that content is releasing at a fine pace, but do understand that a survey of /r/classicwow users is definitely going to skew more "hardcore" than the general playerbase. The people who like the game enough to seek out this subreddit are generally going to be people who play it more often than average.
---
I honestly thought the server transfers were to help those that were stuck waiting in a very long queue to play.  I had no idea that it might also affect the Horde/Alliance ratios.  I completely forgot about that being a thing back in the day.
---
Really? It looks like there's warriors everywhere, did you manage to find a raid spot?
---
the blackout part is something I'd be very interested in, too - as much as I've tried to fit it into end-game healing builds, I still haven't found out what the best way would be.
---
what I can help you with, however, are macros. probably the most important thing as a priest is a mouseover dispel macro bound to one of your mouse buttons\*. if you want to decrease the number of button presses you need, you could start combining shit into the same keypress - I remember using a mouseover macro that threw shield on friendly targets and silenced enemies, no functionality lost, but one less thing to hotkey. you can also do the same with healing and damage spells, but be careful with that as it can take *a lot* of getting used to. it's great if you're a shadowpriest though - you can use the same keys if you're out of shadowform for damage, but if you target an ally, you'll heal them instead.
---
*just to avoid mental fuckery, because mouseover macros bound to keypresses are akin to holding a gun in your right hand and pulling the trigger with left, it tends to feel unnatural.
---
not really that rare of a drop. I got mine as the tank too, but only because the healer already had it
---
Sappy story = karma?
---
Stop asking for upvotes
---
The dwarves are titan races, same as humans, trolls are the ancestors of elves and trolls were on Azeroth before the old gods much less the titans. Azeroth wasn't created by the Titans, Azeroth IS a titan world soul that at some point was discovered by the Pantheon.
---
I cling to the idea, not to the hope. We all know Blizzard will fuck it up, but we would like them not to.
---
That I'm totally guilty of, indeed xD
---
I've always admired your line work.
---
Blizzard opening faction-restricted transfers translates to: 'X faction is dominant on Y server', which is something that I think Blizzard has never admitted to
---
Multiple comment chain making up fantasies about my life. More proof you're a triggered basement dwelling no lifer! 
---
Now I'll do some personal attacks - you're both absolutely pathetic.
---
\*Barracks'd and zug pilled
---
Mind Flay is forever my idea of 'melt faces.' For that reason I'd say no to disc. That being said I follow the cookie cutter idea of shadow dps to level with, and holy/disc/spirit tap to be lv 60 with.
---
I still don't understand what classic+ is.  Is it level 60s raiding karazan, ICC, etc..., with the same class imbalance that is in vanilla?
---
Any Horde on Pyrewood Village and thinking of twinking should come to Nethergarde Keep.
---
That's not its intended usage.  You're supposed to slap it on whatever mage is highest on the threat meter to make an offering to the rng-god.
---
I wish I joined a more casual raiding guild. Not like I'm unhappy with my guild, it just feels bad trying to learn MC when everyone else wants to speedrun
---
It's connected to the lag. None of these servers can handle 1 layer without massive queues and lag. So they deperately open up transfers so they dont have to fix the first two problems.
---
What ends up happening is that certain servers will simply die. 80-90% horde. It will be a PvE server at that point. Oh yea, and the lag will probably still be there.
---
I've seen everything and still people can't reach 5k, just play the game holy...
---
I have 5k and I didnt farm a single day
---
Exactly. Same shit is happening om shazzrah...And when i told some of my fellow horde noobies that fighting 1vs 5 is kinda boring they got offended and called me shit at the game lol. Realy sad that the servers are unbalanced.
---
Classic+. Fuck flying mounts.
---
I’m on heartseeker as horde. Was in Gadgetzan last night and out of about 40+ people in the town I was the only horde that I saw. We are so alliance dominant it’s not even funny.
---
Caveat: since most of these allys came from an over populated server they are generally nice to the horde, at least in my experience. We all respect each other while questing. Though I’m only 45 I can’t speak to end game questing or level 60 or what that will look like in phase 2.
---
Except they do when they are faced with incredibly long queues, something that will happen again come Tuesday.
---
I nearly rolled on Skeram (even started there, but could only fight the queue boss so long)...ended up on Thunderfury and its been great.  The server isn't huge which may be an issue far down the road, but its got a healthy population and the horde/alliance ratio is balanced good enough.
---
I honestly don't have any fun stomping someone in a 5v1. I love a good 1v1 or even a chaotic slightly mismatched 12v16, but there's no fun if there's no chance of losing.
---
Because I think that people who play a lot are more likely to quit due to a lack of content.  I do not believe that people who play a little will quit because other people are playing and enjoying content that they cannot yet enjoy.  As I mentioned, I think that if you quit when the honor system rolls out because it comes out before you hit 60 you'd be in a very staunch minority of players.
---
I actually think giving people something to strive for keeps the game fun and interesting.  A lack of content is what makes the game bad.
---
&gt; From Blizzards perspective, doing TBC is the safe, obvious play (and what they'll probably go with due to it's predictability and the lesser resource requirement for the dev team). It's a beloved expansion (by most) and the content is already fully mapped out, however it would also signal that their goal here with the whole Classic subcategory is just to milk nostalgia for a few years until they've exhausted the Classic trilogy content (or whenever they would choose to stop) and then call it day.
---
This is why I think this is the most likely option. :(
---
Acknowledging balance issues doesn’t make them any better. Forcing server transfers for the dominant faction won’t make customers happy, either. 
---
Imagine if blizzard came out and said “X server is 80-20 horde”. No alliance would want to make characters there, and the current alliance would probably want to transfer somewhere that has a better balance, making it worse.
---
I think the usual guess is also Blizzard's reason: players wouldn't self balance, they would double down on the imbalances by choosing dominate factions.
---
Understand that tanks don't have significant AOE damage abilities. Warriors actually have no AOE damage abilities they can use in defensive stance. We can use WW or TClap, but neither get the threat bonus when we use them and it will certainly hit weaker than your WW.
---
Generally speaking you need to give your tank at least 1.5 seconds per mob they pull before you do any AOE, or just be okay with having aggro on stuff. Be more patient about charging in right off the bat, especially if the tank is pulling vs charging in himself. Target something weak that you can handle pulling aggro on (like a caster or healer) and open up with MS before you start cleaving.
---
Often times if you can give the tank enough time to sunder each mob once by delaying your first WW, then your WW won't pull aggro and he will be able to multi threat with tab/sunders enough to keep aggro. It's the big charge, Sweeping, WW, burst that really is a pain to deal with. The tank needs things hitting him to generate sufficient rage so it just keeps snowballing out of control if you snap aggro off him right at the beginning.
---
No I don't but nothing forbids you to do it, just know that if you start doing that on one item people will ask you to do the same for others and it will quickly become a nightmare in my opinion.
---
In my formula a belt is a belt  so the only difference between the mana igniting belt and a T1 belt is the iLvL (71 vs 66) making the mana igniting belt 157,5DKP and a T1 belt 120DKP.
---
For the staff of dominance vs Mageblade it's a 2H weapon vs 1H so not the same slot modifier (1.5 vs 1) because with the Mageblade you also need to loot/get an offhand.
---
In my loot table Staff of Dominance is 300DKP and Mageblade is 210DKP (the Fired Rune Grimoire is 100DKP making the combo 310DKP for example).
---
You don't need to speak french to understand/use my loot table spreadsheet it's just that the items name are written in french and the links send you to the french version of Wowhead Classic, you can just change the site langage after landing on the item page if you want.
---
Check your DM for the spreadsheet link, hope it will help you :)
---
You mean 2 ubrs runs and 1 lbrs run, all standard start to end runs, and 4 dragons vs 3 brd runs prison runs including an escort and 1 ubrs run and a 25 elite dragon kill quest.
---
This was so funny to me loll, thanks op
---
I don't want a ton of Horde transferring to my server.   Let them languish with nobody to kill, reroll to alliance,  or pay for a transfer.
---
People who still play retail, ofc they think wrath is the best.
---
Heh. 
---
Horde on overpopulated servers: HAHAHA RED IS DEAD FUCK OFF IF YOU DONT LIKE BEING CAMPED FOR HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY!
---
Also Horde on overpopulated servers: Where did everybody go? Guys come back I need you to farm honor! Come be a glorified NPC!
---
I legitimately got bored on my previous PvP server over player imbalance issues. I was playing PvE while alliance weren’t getting to play at all, because two dozen horde were roaming every single place they tried to level and rolling over them all day every day. 
---
The server transfers are to give people who actually want to play the game alliance side an option to head elsewhere and enjoy themselves.
---
It's not only from before they broke census it isn't even up to date to most recently after census was broken. The new data is insubstantial currently as well because not enough people are uploading and people from the less dominant faction are much more inclined to actually spend the time to manually click the who button 3000 times
---
Yup. Heart seeker essentially got all of Stalagg’s rage quitters. Not the greatest pool to be in.
---
reaction andy
---
How much is that thing worth? Seen it on the AH recently for about 8g.
---
(Shadow priest here)
---
Sell princess mara runs. You can use master looter and take all the drops for vendor and charge a flat fee for blackstone ring on drop, usually 10-20g. Can also make good AH money selling herbs and/or mining ore/stone. If you can’t find any buyers, it’s still worth about 30g/h in vendor gold. Herb and ore g/h varies by server economy but on mine I would estimate herbs are worth 12-15g/h and ore is worth 9-12g/h. 
---
Make sure to kill tinkerer first, as you need to make each run last at least 12 minutes to prevent lockouts. Use an alt and invite to the party for resets to save time trying to find someone. Also make sure to bring barov’s trinket to trigger her dust storm, and a few mana/health pots don’t hurt either. But I RARELY die now so if you have your pre-bis gear should be super easy. YouTube has multiple examples of how to path when kiting her. Best of luck!
---
Honestly, I don’t like either idea. For me, TBC was the beginning of the end of what made WoW so fun and special. If blizzard decides to go down that path, I will not follow suit.
---
With regards to a classic+, I’m not eager because I simply cannot trust the current blizzard staff to make the game compelling and fun. From my perspective, blizzard is a shell of its former self and its core values don’t align with making great games anymore. I haven’t played one game they’ve made in the past decade that has kept me around for more than a couple months at most, let alone 15 years later.
---
Warriors need single target threat abilities to be able to hold off against DPS. With 2-3 targets the tank may be able to use a single target ability on all of them before your aoe pulls. With 6+ targets the aoe will pull.
---
One easy trick to do is to kill first priority to zero before opening up aoe. Alternatively communicate with your tank and healer to see if they mind you taking some aggro.
---
In general, it's ideal to pull aggro on caster mobs because the tank does jack all to mitigate damage and you can focus on interrupting casting.
---
I'm just talking about tanking lvl 60 5 man's in general, but yea tanking when you're under leveled will always suck
---
You just keep saying the number isn’t useful to you when he says the number is useful information.
---
Just watch out for any collages on here regarding new girlfriends that a guy met in WoW.
---
Heart seeker is clearly not 90-10. That’s ridiculous.
---
More like, I'm gonna be spit on bc I look like the most unoriginal gnome you can met.
---
Good ol China.
---
It's also amazing how many mobile games are exactly the same game, just with different art styles / graphics.
---
TBC with the changes I would like is effectively classic+.
---
No major hubs to split the population.
---
No flying mounts.
---
Zones compacted, and are now lvl 60 instance level hard (group level zones, basically)
---
No level 70, no Heroic dungeons.  
---
Provide alternate leveling path gear.
---
Introduce new races and classes, and races.
---
Most instances are 10 or 20 man raids with the exception of Vashj, Illidan, Kael.
---
Comb through the sunwell stuff with a "is this stupid?" tag.
---
Make opening the portal an AQ40-esque event.
---
Who has fun 5v1ing people?
---
I guess a lotta people who play WoW got bullied as kids and take it out here. 
---
Why don’t you go beat some 7 year olds at basketball and laugh in their face?
---
I think that is called retail.

They're just being true to the wow lore.
---
It's your own problem if you burn through all the P1 content in less than 3 months. There is no lack of content in Classic right now, unless you no-lifed through all of it. And that would be your own problem.
---
Been playing horde over there since opening day. The server population has risen quite steady since and is perfect atm imo. Please stay away... jk. I’m sure you’ll like it here.
---
**You're trying to solve an impossible problem by ignoring an obvious solution.** It's not possible to make pvp servers balanced, period. The best you can hope for is less unbalanced but it will always be unbalanced overall because there are FAR more horde players on pvp servers. 
---
If the balance bothers someone enough they are able to do something about it, reroll. Rerolling is a terrible option but it's far more idiotic to think you can balance pvp servers with their current population split. One is a terrible solution and the other is literally impossible. Use common sense and decide for yourself is it's worth rerolling or dealing with pop imbalance.
---
No that’s not what I’m saying in the slightest. People assumed that each of two layers was capped at 3k because the server could handle 6k people in total. They thought that by removing layering the server would still manage 6k people, but they would be on the same single “layer.”
---
Meteor Shard? Swinetusk Shank? Toxic Revenger? There's plenty of options.
---
A rogue rolling on hypnotic is dumb.
---
Beautiful.
---
It’s not too late to roll horde before P2.
---
Jesus dude calm down.
---
I quoted the sentence that implied that. If it read "Burrito's 1-4 have 20% chili and 80% cheese while Burrito 5 has 80% chili and 20% cheese" then I wouldn't have said anything.
---
I haven't defended Blizzard at all in my comment.

Lbrs then ubrs for rends head then ubrs for dragons eyes then 4 world dragons then ubrs for drak blood.

How? Naga farm all day? Or the other pearl farm if you know
---
It’s scary how easy it is to find someone’s Facebook or twitter, and a few clicks later you know they’re married, where they work, and how many kids just from their social media. Which to your point, is why I try to act on the internet as I would to a colleague I might see in a meeting in the future, even if I haven’t worked with them directly yet.
---
That’s far from a solution considering how horde favoured retail still is, not hating just being honest with saying they literally have never cared about balance.
---
Do you understand double standards, and contributing to the problem?
---
I play ally on stalagg and have a great time, but then again I’m not dogshit at pvp
---
Yeah, when people think of TBC, they remember Karazhan and Attunements, not the mindless Heroic Slave Pens farming after 2.4.
---
I literally deleted my 49 alliance rogue and rerolled horde. 
---
It really is that bad
---
Every PvP server I've ever been on has had miserable faction balance issues.  Counting on Blizzard to not screw up PvP is like counting on the sun never rising again.  It's why I refused to roll on a PvP server this time.
---
So, by staying, I am helping to solve the problem? No, I’m staying even.
---
Yeah... I even provided sources that layers would impact queues.  BS still persisted.
---
Only downside is not being able to DE BoP items but yeah still totally worth the alt having enchanting
---
Yours is the most rational and concise comment, and also the most downvoted. we live in a what?
---
what is emfh `?
---
Maybe in 1v1s,  in group pvp I'll take paladin over shaman every day of the week.
---
But it was caught on the first cast so if you only cast once then you have a 100% chance to catch it.
---
TFW there have always been dailies in Vanilla. 
---
Sometimes I feel like the #nOcHaNgEs people complain about stuff they have no clue about.
---
There's all kinds of repeatable/daily stuff  in Vanilla. While it's on the same level as TBC, it's clearly there. 
---
Maybe some of this community should be called the #CaNtThInKfOrMySeLf community.
---
On Herod it’s the same. I was trying to get to LBRS last week and had to corpse run 6 times to get in. It’s fucking stupid
---
Server imbalance doesn't matter in retail
---
Again I think you're in the minority with that opinion, but time will tell.  I'm sure Blizzard is monitoring these things and will release content as they feel appropriate in order to keep the highest number of people interested in the game.
---
Without the level increase the gear would (further) break the game. 
---
Best example of this I can think of is the how tanks vs bosses work. (For simplicities sake I'm not going to account for shields and block value, or crits. They make a real difference but complicate the math a lot.
---
In all blues I'm sitting around 56% damage reduction, 25% avoidance (dodge/parry), and around 6k hp. 
---
In T3/Naxx level gear I'd be around 70% damage reduction, 50% avoidance (dodge/parry), and around 6k hp, and 10k hp
---
In my current blues, if a boss attacks once a second now for 1k dmg it'll do ~460 dmg after armor and I'll avoid it 1/4 of the time, an average boss dps of 345 damage or 5.75% of my health. 
---
In that T3/Naxx gear, if a boss attacks once a second for 1k dmg it'll do ~300 dmg after armor and I'll avoid it 1/2 the time, an average boss dps of 150 dmg or .15% of my health.
---
Now to get a boss to do 5.75% of my health in Naxx gear they'd have to have a dps of 575. That means each hit needs to land for 1,150,. Before armor reduction then it needs to swing for ~3825. 
---
There are a lot of problems with scaling when you get to this point. A string of unlucky rolls in Naxx means the tank is gonna take 3 hits in a row w/o avoiding and be dead in 3 seconds. That same boss if it hits a melee they'll be dead in two shots or less with no chance of being saved. At current content that would be much closer to 6 seconds. 
---
Most expansions have this problem. It's why in Sunwell there is a hidden debuff that reduced tanks chances to dodge by 20%. Tanks were having the same problem so Blizz corrected it by reducing the chance to dodge so bosses wouldn't have to hit as hard to obtain the same dps.
---
TLDR; tank scaling and rng drives boss damage to extremes and rng can shit on you.
---
I dont like what TBC means for the future of classic.
---
Next is wotlk then cata.
---
I quit in cata. Why would I want it to go back the way it was?
---
Classic+ could start with literally tbc. Just tweak a few things so you can say it's not going down the same path.
---
I dont want to play for a year just to quit again
---
Right, unlike you who knows the inner working of classic wow better than the devs.
---
You think you do, but you don't!
---
It's people not understanding how and why the spec works (and why it is used) or people who use it as an excuse to stay in DPS spec while "tanking" and finding groups faster.
---
If you know your way around tanking, understand the limits and possibilities of the spec and have good gear, then fine, by all means.
---
How does the transfer work? Will everything in my bank move with me?
---
But healers are overrated in general, at least my raid has an abundance of them. We did the last MC clear with 12 healers, I think if I wouldn't have specced for PI, I'd honestly feel completely useless.
---
Again,  I didn't say you did.   I don't know why you chose to take that as a personal attack It really was not directed at you.  I didn't say "how are you arguing against this"   I actually assumed a general agreement regarding the faction imbalance problem on some servers.
---
I'm perfectly calm
---
Attempted callout = attempted karma?
---
Yes to all.
---
Because you'd still have insane issues with world bosses and such. Also if they ever to decide to go with the tbc route servers would need to get fixed
---
I want Classic+ because I want to see all the what ifs! What if Cataclysm never happened, would I be able to travel to Uldum. Would the walls of Gilneas come down? The classic WoW lore was like a garden of fun plots to uncover. I want a version of Classic+ where WE discover these places. I want to apply the Classic philosophy to the whole of Azeroth. These zones that never were opened before for one reason or another, they HAD to have had a reason why an adventurer didn't stumble upon them. I want a version of Classic where there is NOWHERE on the map that cannot be filled in. I don't want to fly there. I want to experience it with all the fun a difficulty of Searing Gorge. I want to check in at Kara or try and help the Blood Elves of Silvermoon BEFORE they joined the Horde. I want to see Zandalar through the eyes of a Darkspear troll who just hit Zul'Gurub and discovered Hakar. Would we be able to establish Honor Hold in Borean Tundra earlier.   
---
Gameplay/design wise. I want to do a quest/raid to "attune" to the new zones. I want to finish Uldaman and decide that I'd rather try and find MORE titan facilities to level in places like Sholazar Basin. After beating Cthun, I want to try and track down Nzoth or Yogg Saron. Direct questline style. I want more RPG in my MMORPG and Classic+ is a great way to take WoW and treat it like a writing first draft.
---
Same i feel mages and warriors are in a worse spot. I really enjoy hemo sword spec in pvp its so strong atm
---
While this can look a bit intimidating it's actually quite simple if you break it down. For my example I'll use the probability of getting a 4 when rolling a 6 sided dice. 
---
* (1/6)^y = chance of you getting a 4 y times in a row
---
* (1-1/6)^y = (5/6)^y = chance of failing to get a 4 if you roll y times. (there are 5 sides that are not a 4)
---
* 1-(1-1/6)^y = chance of not failing to get a 4 y times in a row. This means that at least one of the rolls was at least a 4.
---
&gt; Personally I wouldn't mind some kind of time travelling alternate universe plot device to justify the new direction
---
You just figured out the long con.
---
Blizzard spends the next two retail expansions bringing mechanics back towards Vanilla WoW starting with the level squish in shadowlands.
---
Meanwhile Classic+ has two expansions of its own. With its own story in an alternate Azeroth where the dark portal never reopened. They keep the experience mostly the same but add a few controversial things from retail (like daily quests) that’ll drive some people away but the majority stay.
---
Then, bam, the next expansion for each game is a shared expansion where the timeways collide with Retail and Classic now finding themselves in a shared universe.
---
Fast forward half a decade after that where enough people have now left the game for Classic private severs that Blizzard decides to announce Classic 2, which eventually gets its own timeline that tells separate story from Retail and Classic 1 until BAM, that merges into the timeline too!
---
This process repeats until our children’s children are now slaves to Blizzard Entertainment.
---
The long con.
---
You can't beat clubbing.
---
Onyxia is fucking with the ogres in Dustwallow.
---
From the "Identifying the Brood" quest chain:
---
 Stonemaul Village was invaded by the brood of Onyxia. But why would the daughter of the black dragonlord, Deathwing, descend upon our lands?This is most troubling. Surely, Onyxia was driven here for a purpose beyond laying siege to a small band of ogres.  
---
Notify Mok'Morokk at once! Action must be taken. 
---
 Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch.  
---
Make haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them.  We will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground. 
---
TL:DR:   OH GOD THERE'S AN EVIL DRAGON IN OUR BACK YARD AND IT'S GOING TO KILL US ALL

They could jncentivise it  Free month if you switch. Or 500 in-game gold.

---
This is where I would post the Michael Jackson popcorn gif if reddit allowed in line images.
---
Flying mounts only mountable at the Gryphon / Wyvern master's would be a good compromise in my opinion.
---
I want classic+ because their is clearly so much content in vanilla that they wanted to do back in the day that they couldn't or didn't get to do. Instead they went to Outland and only got back around to (making a mess of it) it in cata.
---
There are instance portals to: hyjal and stormwind sewers. There are massive gates entrances to the timbermaw hold and grim batol, perhaps vanilla Karazahn or the emerald dream. There are zones like uldum, and hyjal as well as the twilight highlands that were added in cata that we could see a vanilla version.
---
You could take the option to make gear sets in these new raids that add needed abilities or effects to hybrid specs that aren't as viable. Dual wield to enhancement shamans for example. Only slightly improved stats to stop gear bloat. As Naxx gear is  really op.
---
Basically classic has so much yet to offer that going to BC would feel like a disservice to the amount of community time and effort spent getting classic in the first place.
---
Let's  enjoy classic, and start talking classic plus around ZG. So we can have something for after nax on the development cycle. Then let's start talking BC around Naxx so we can have some BC hype after classic +.
---
More old school wow rather than rushing back through it for a quick buck. Thoighlets be fair I'm expecting to have to pay a premium for this stuff in the future because blizzard is ran by the finance department these days.
---
In raids it's pretty much like you said, you're just competing for the heal. You spam flash heal, maybe R5 and Max. 
---
In my guild, we clear MC in about an HR so there's plenty of healing to go around. While some people are drinking, you are supporting half the raid by yourself. Etc. 
---
I enjoy it, but it's not for everyone.
---
the quest giver is in booty bay
---
still in booty bay!
---
It does seem like a poor time to squeeze in last minute population balancing. Surely by now they realize that the high pop servers have high server loyalty, and the unbalanced servers will likely just become less balanced?       
---
          
---
What they really need to do IMO (but won't because everyone will want to crucify them for it) is close character creation on the problematic servers and just start transplanting social groups off of them and onto their other servers. Respect friends' lists and guilds to the greatest extent you can, keeping the social roots intact, and move them to redistribute and balance populations.       
---
         
---
Yes, this would mean you might wake up tomorrow and find that all your guild and all your characters are how on Heartseeker when they were on Faerlina. But if done right, you're now on a server whose population is better managed and curated. Use your established social circle to put down new roots and grow your community in its new home.       
---
            
---
People wouldn't stand for it though, and I can't blame them. But to me, that's what the *real* solution to this is. Voluntary relocation doesn't work.
---
&gt;Yeah TBC (altered) would be amazing. Remove flying (aka they need to do some changes to the world), no shared city, no resillience (balance out arena gear) etc.
---
Sooo, not TBC, more like Classic+ is what you're saying...and it's what most TBC people are saying
---
DD was truly fucked when it didn’t release alongside grobbulus. Immensely important for an rp server: you don’t start your rp then 5 hours later go “oops haha time to restart”.
---
Grob adopters stayed there.
---
&gt; their goal here with the whole Classic subcategory is just to milk nostalgia
---
Have you been paying attention to Blizz at all? They’ve been doing the same thing with all their IP. WC3 reforged, Starcraft HD, the entire concept of HotS...
---
Most of the t1 pieces for mage is a bit of a letdown. The set bonuses after the 3 set one is close to useless.
---
You want to use the head, the boots and the wrists from the t1 set, when you get the t2 head, just put it in the bank to look at :) T1 is simply better. Hit ftw :)
---
Belt: Ban'thok Sash, or even Clutch of Andros is better than t1.
---
Gloves: Hands of Power are better than t1, hands down ;) Even green "of frozen wrath" gloves can be better.
---
Legs: T1 works, but t2 of ragnaros is better. I think i'd go for t2 even if it meant breaking the three set bonus from t1...that one might be up for debate though?
---
Shoulders: Boreal Mantle is better than t1. So is Burial Shawl, and even greens with the suffix "of frozen wrath" can be.
---
Chest: Robe of the Archmage is your go to here, but it requires you to be a tailor to equip, so if you're not a tailor, go for Freezing Lich Robes or Robe of Volatile Power over the t1 chest.

---
a lot of top guilds are ally on skeram. The ally have way more good players than the horde do.
---
I enjoyed 25 man raiding but not nearly as much as 40 man.  You felt like more of a team in the larger raid, because you were working in sync with more people at your specific role.
---
Cool. My server is 50/50. It's fun. Some nights BRM is controlled by horde other times it's alliance.  
---
 Horde tried to raid SW last night and got absolutely stuffed lol never even made it past the front gates.
---
You need to read more patch notes. "Server optimizations" is a pretty common thing to see across all of gaming. But of course you just _want_ to complain.
---
It's crazy how good the writing is in vanilla, i miss when wow had a soul.
---
I liked resilience for the first couple of seasons, it really went overboard from season 3 on. In season 1 with less resilience there were more viable comps, by the end of TBC it was all cookie cutter comps designed to beat resilience via CC or huge burst.
---
That's how it's always worked, isn't it? You queue to log your account in to a selected server. Once you're at the character select screen, you're logged in. Going to character select doesn't log you out (even though the button says so).

North is a bitch boy anyway.

Fully upgraded grunts use arcanite weapons and armor, so that's pretty fitting

Damn this didn’t age well. Sorry for your loss mate.
---
For me, I'd suspect FoW would be important for solo grinding, since the OP's looking for an all-round spec. I can see your argument though where PvP is concerned.
---
I'm not defending Blizzard and they should allow faction specific transfers, but most people won't take them.  If people didn't evenly distribute before, what makes you think they would now?
---
Blizzard could do whatever they want, the problem is the community.
---
All alliance SHOULD leave.  Any horde player who says they didn’t know it was going to be overpopulated is full of shit.  And they didn’t complain when they were leveling and murdering every ally 5v1. 
---
LEAVE THE SERVERS.  You’ll be going to a server where you will at least have a chance, but there will still be plenty of pvp happening.  Let these horde players sit around holding their dicks in phase 2.
---
Git gud son, you dont do BRD runs at level 10? Pfft
---
Skeram is WAY worse than our server, albeit our server is not very good. Tried to enter the arena with a fellow 60 last night and literally just 15 horde there of all levels lmao. We were the only alliance so we just slowly backed the hell outta there.
---
Is there any information since the census addon about faction balance on each server? Kirtonos was crazy imbalanced (like 2:1 horde favor) and I don't think it's gotten any better. In a similar vein to faction specific transfers I would LOVE to see faction specific server queues.  
---
I hate waiting in a queue to log in as one of the 4 people on the server playing alliance.  I think at the very least this would help alleviate the threshold to which a faction disparity can exist.
---
Well, fundamentally, each layer is a "fraction of the server max."  
---
Anyone who believed it would still handle 6k people fundamentally misunderstood the point of layers to begin with.
---
🔴🔵🔴
---
Yeah except it kind of doesnt.
---
Priests, paladins/shamans, druids all can heal.
---
Only druids and warriors tank.
---
There are way more limited number of tank spots in raids han DPS meaning lots of warriors will respec to DPS.
---
Tanking also is expensive for repair bills and if you want to do PVP you're eating respec costs too.
---
Plus there is a lot of pressure for you to know everything and lead your dungeon or raid team. So lots of would-be tanks bow out and become DPS.
---
Tanks also tend to get geared first in raids. Which means they quickly go from needing dungeon gear to not needing any dungeon at all except pure gold profit.
---
Tanks are by far the least populated of the three roles, get gear faster than most, and quickly wont need any dungeons ever again.
---
Hell we dont even have any really difficult dungeon drops like HOJ or Briar Reed or Pattern of Archmage that require major farming. Most of our dungeon loot is pretty easy drop rates.
---
They don't have to acknowledge balance issues, just silently close transfers for one faction. It's not like most people would notice anyway.
---
Yep. It didn't even need to be a flagship game, they could have released it as a mini-game addon or a small DLC for people to tool around with. I think someone at Blizzard actively dislikes Starcraft and sabotages things related to it.
---
Say it louder for the people in back
---
2x xp for the underdog bam
---
You give it to the warlocks and hope they crit, they'll pull aggro on kelthuzad from MC it'll be so much threat.  They have no threat talents.
---
Warchief's blessing, blue weapons, and improved cleave, sorry you don't know how to play the game, but I do.
---
Do you notice a difference when solo farming/questing?
---
Let's rework that.
---
You shouldn't have &gt;7d played to 60, there are guides. Not using guides your fault. A little over 2 hours a day or 14 hours a week.
---
Or, 1 hour a day, and a 8-10 extra hours alotted over the weekend.
---
How is this not manageable?
---
Again, MMOs aren't for you if you can't get that much time in.
---
Oh god no not more transfers from Stalagg, it already takes like an hour to find a group on ally
---
I don’t cling to the hope of it but the idea of it. Would be awesome.
---
Exactly. New blizzard of barely capable of maintain the old tech of their predecessors, let alone producing anything new at remotely the same quality level. It's like the orcs of warhammer 4000. I'd be happy with permanent Classic. Getting every combination through naxx will take a lifetime. I doubt Classic+ would be worthwhile unless they managed to contract with the original devs
---
But you were wrong...hahahhaa
---
If u wanna spam brd/other 5mans till 60 stay prot and practice ur optimal threat rotation
---
That Mage knew exactly what he was doing. He Poly'd you so you'd regain HP hoping you'd likely kill the Rogue. He could've ended you then and there but decided to Polymorph you instead. If he's that high of a level then he would know that Polymorphing an enemy has them regain their HP fairly quickly, he could have easily done something else but decided against it. He is the true MVP here. He likely hated that Rogue and said fuck it. You and that Mage should team up more often lmao.
---
Every Man for Himself
---
It’s probably not far off - 80/20 more likely
---
Not joining the underdog side makes you a bigger coward / loser than people that play on PvE servers. Change my mind.
---
Assuming you are Alliance, Warriors are an unstoppable force because they have priority on dispels and freedoms. Especially with a Paladin who plays correctly on the front lines with all the warriors.
---
Rogue is usefull here, kill one torch guy, loot it and vanish. No need to clear that much.
---
Make honor gains scale based on current faction balance? In other words, if there's a 70/30 A:H ratio at a given hour, Horde players get a 20% boost to honor gain that hour. Would give incentives for PvPers to move to imba realms, and over time things might tend closer to 50/50.
---
Who is that?
---
[The only reason we need](https://tenor.com/view/bruce-banner-big-monster-thor-ragnarok-hulk-gif-11571578)
---
you'd look like a clown waiting 9 seconds to dps on a trash pack of a dungeon lol
---
I played EQ from a week after launch through Velious.... I remember my gear getting replaced each expansion.  Maybe not as quickly as WoW (like you said, some greens were better), but it definitely wasn't useful for too long.
---
This is literally the best part of vanilla. You're a base level peon who is working their way up to becoming a hero and taking part in some of the greatest events that ever happen.   
---
It feels grounded, it feels as real as fighting internet dragons ever gets. Meanwhile in BFA/legion you're near single handledly fighting a sky demon who stabs the entire planet.
---
Same here on all accounts - feels pretty good right now. Let's see..
---
Blizzards “solution” will be paid transfers.  Get out while you can for free.
---
I solo farm lashers on my paladin in about 12-13 minutes per clear.
---
&gt; Deviate Delight
---
DD is most certainly not dead -- you can prove this by binding a key to "Open Chat Panel" in keybindings under *Interface Panels*. Join /LookingForGroup then open that pane and just count the number of players.
---
During prime DD has well over 500 Horde alone sitting in that channel, and Horde is the lower faction. Orgrimmar General will have tons in the channel, as well. You don't need a census to get a gauge on a server, and DD is definitely not dead.
---
That's exactly what I mean. Alliance and horde favored different personalities and this fit with the lore. In tbc the game legit became about as "sucking as many people in and making everyone happy" which makes sense for business but not for art (RPGs are an art)
---
How dare you use actual evidence! I only transferred because "insert excuse that makes me the victim of my own actions that were obviously out of my control".
---
I've blown a lot on mats for both the decilsaur set and now lionheart helm. It's not cheap.
---
Wow I couldn't imagine playing a game for a couple hours while being the sole person responsible for a baby. Fuck is wrong with ppl lmao
---
For me I'd like to see the best of both worlds. Release up to WotLK, then start Classic+ and either prune or grow based on playerbase feedback.
---
Faerlina already has queues around prime time, during phase two expect 5+ hour queues.
---
I was just looking at that mace last night, its up for 50g I think I might pick it up.
---
1. You dont. Specifically for other classes. Unfair? Whatever.
---
2. Besides the point. Shouldve been added ages ago.
---
I'd play either.
---
This is the way to go.
---
Bottom line if you're in my raid team I have incentive for you to get geared so my runs go smoother.
---
Helping you helps me.
---
Helping some rando pugger who needs Strat Live literally has no benefit for me for the time investment.
---
No loot, not a good gold income, and no major drops worth getting. Just a big old waste of my time unless they offer to pay me.
---
LOOOL EPIC MEME 
---
GAY = BAD
---
Before they nerfed /who there were 5 or 6 servers that were decently balanced - specifically Blaumeaux has near 50-50 probably still, probably no worse than 55-45
---
I know that was exactly why I mentioned it, because I KNOW it's a bad talent, but for the way I play the game it's quite useful, I rarely kill 1 mob at a time.
---
Keep up the good work, mate.
---
Guess I'll put your boy Taxes on my kos list then
---
&gt;In season 1 with less resilience there were more viable comps, by the end of TBC it was all cookie cutter comps designed to beat resilience via CC or huge burst.
---
That has more to do with arena being in its infancy and people having no idea what comps were the best. Nothing to do with resilience.
---
All these math nerds tho!
---
Maybe the horde guilds should transfer before it's too late too.
---
Well, he's effectively admitting that we knew what we were talking about and we were right.
---
Apology accepted.
---
That would motivate the guild to transfer then. Might be a great solution.
---
Why the fuck are you even playing Classic then? The game is a grind, classic players want grindy things, which actually mean something, instead of random purple generator 5000 with forced capped daily quest simulator.
---
Guess I misheard info before initial release. Just feels like it's moving fast. I've skipped a lot of easy kills because I wouldn't get honor for it. I feel like that won't be the case as much once honor system hits, and I'll get destroyed much more in these last 10 levels
---
Def a top 3 I idolized Nition and Eviscerate(Akrios) when I played rogue in vanilla. I joined them on my shaman in the later half of TBC. Hated sounds familiar.
---
They can't really merge servers, names would need to forcibly be changed for players, it'd only work no if players or guilds shared names between either of the servers.
---
Down for TBC right about now.
---
Thank you for the very kind words.
---
North run me through ubrs please I need ony attune
---
Have you tried playing on a sever where this cant happen?
---
You literally chose to play on a place specifically where this happens
---
Mind Flay for dayzzzz
---
Why should any player care about solving the problem if it doesn't benefit them?
---
I ran BRD 127 times for my Hand of Justice. It is mind numbing, but I like min/maxing.
---
I just wanna leave herod for a pve server.
---
Would motivate your guild to transfer improving the balance on both servers though
---
So don't let them.
---
"We are sorry, but the faction you have chosen is full on this server.  Please select the opposing faction or choose another server with a healthier balance.  Thank You."
---
Problem solved.  It's simple but they won't do it.
---
To say resilience had nothing to do with it is unfair. By end of TBC you had people running prot pally/warrior/frost DK etc... Then in WOTLK you had like African turtle and other comps that were designed to exploit resilience. I arena'd a lot back then and really enjoyed it - but in hindsight it was complete garbage unless you were playing a top 3 comp/class or willing to re-roll to whatever the flavor of the month was every season.
---
&gt; because you can't make people take a transfer, and why would they when they're the top dog?
---
Put Faction based queues on top of faction based transfers. Want to sit in 10-16 hours queues every day, to be the "top dog"? I doubt it.
---
3 uses
---
This a million times. 
---
Why redo the same mistakes twice?
---
It's the general idea bro, he can figure it out from there and adjust per mob.  If you don't want to pull aggro with a warrior tank who has to tab all over.  
---
Your input is helpful for op who is worried about pulling aggro like a good dps should be.
---
You see those memes.... so I started blasting... that's about you.
---
You think you do
---
My dream for Classic:
---
Vanilla - TBC - Wrath, kill Arthas, quit WOW and never look back.
---
Just like I did the first time around.
---
I wouldnt play Classic+
---
Omg remember the crybabies complaining about that happening in retail? Those people would throw a fit out of this dimension if any of the improvements that make retail awesome found their way into classic.
---
Makes it a lot more fun! :).
---
Then dont play on a pvp realm, if u decide to play on pvp, deal with it
---
As a tank, I like leaving the least dangerous but easily killed mob for last, as they provide safe damage based rage.  The 'stronger' mobs should die first because they usually have CC or the potential to spike damage and kill me if they get a spell crit/healer is going for a long cast heal.  Kill order is always by danger order rather than fastest way to reduce overall enemy DPS.
---
I mean I personally don't mind, my boyfriend is just new to WoW, saw how much I was enjoying Classic and wanted to join to play, and did so on the same realm.
---
I just don't see the point for level 60s' to kill level 30s' for no reason, especially since Phase 2 isn't even out yet...
---
Depends on your server probably but I love it.
---
Wheres the suicide bot
---
Having played alliance all through vanilla,  and now playing horde in classic I have to say I miss SW and IF (darn can suck it).  The stormwind music is my favorite from the game and I use it on my d&amp;d playlists.  The canals of SW and the lava of IF are so flavorful and cool.  UC is my favorite horde city with its toxic green slime dripping everywhere. I find both TB and especially org to be quite meh.
---
That's CAPTAIN Tauren to you
---
Yep, at least for me. I had to do like 10 reloads an hour in raid because that option was not ticked.
---
They just don't have strong enough wills.
---
nah it´s 100% when it drops and 0% when it doesn´t drop.
---
It's just a part of the game. But I get the feeling your boyfriends mental health is an underlying problem.
---
I'm assuming you're on a pve server. PvP server it wouldn't matter as all your characters are the same faction on a particular server.
---
I don't know how they'd do it for pve servers.
---
The actual suggestion in retail is to get rid of horde vs alliance and just have it be races.
---
why did you roll on a pvp server lol...
---
Yeah, except players who put in the tiniest bit of research are already doing that.  As long as Blizzard doesn't advertise their rationale, it shouldn't drive faction imbalance up - certainly not to nearly the degree that non-faction-specific transfers have driven faction imbalance up, anyway.
---
If you spec Holy / Ret and go something like 33/0/18, you can grab Seal of Command and the +5% critical and it's really not so bad. Throw on some spell damage pieces with your ret gear (a ring or a trinket here, a cloak there) and go to town.
---
Parses are pretty meaningless for healers right now. The worse your guild is the more healing is required. The top parses are going to be cheesing and heal sniping.
---
&gt;whereas TBC is tangible and we all know what we'd be getting.
---
Yeah, we know what we're getting. But for many of us, [it absolutely sucks.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dtg25u/z/f6x81jd)
---
That's why I'm wanting Classic+. Maybe you're right that it's a pipedream, but I'd rather wish on that cause than play what became the beginning of the end of WoW.
---
Why would it be?
---
You're pretending that faction based queues don't create new problems.
---
*It's Phase 3 and you have to wait 30 minutes in a queue to login to the server so you can queue again for battlegrounds in a shared battlegroup.*
---
What neck?
---
Yea true, but still, I don't personally get it. The only times I've actually been attacked like this is always just people that are over leveled and can stomp you...
---
It's not an issue in practise, your pet does not have enough DPS to pull aggro. It might do if you accidentally leave Growl on auto, but even then if you're giving the tank time (like DPS should) then it probably won't pull aggro.
---
Of course you should have growl off though.
---
I played Planetside and Planetside 2 (and left P2 and came back years later for a month or two) and left those games because they are all about pvp but they can't handle the big battles. At a certain point you just have to decide if a game is going to be able to meet your expectations and what you want out of it, and if it's not, just move on. Like I said before, Rimworld is fun. If you're anything like the average gamer (or me) you have 10+ unplayed games in your steam library. Take a break and give one a try, monitor the patch notes and look for "server optimizations."
---
Agreed. Currently I see plenty of one-sided battles happening in both directions, but it's not like I'm checking out multiple zones at the same time. Hard to have an overall picture, everyone just has, "A bunch of the other team killed me TWICE this server is AT LEAST 80% (the team I'm not on)."
---
And 52-60 almost everything that drops thats an upgrade is gonna last you a LONG while.
---
Yes it did.
---
Ok..  it still isn’t a problem for me. Ive been in massive battles and no lag. No lag for my raid as well.
---
Cant remember, some int/sta/spi one
---
Yes, and if you attack a fellow druid, you should lose Cenarion Circle rep.
---
Man, there's so much cool shit they could do in classic with the reputation system to make actions carry a lot more weight.
---
You have output right there.... it got up to 525. The consecutive # is the # of full censuses it has completed...
---
But muh slippery slope
---
Acknowledging balance issues doesn't intrinsically make them any better off, sure.  But if they HAVE to acknowledge balance issues to actually, ya know, fix the balance issues, assuming that acknowledging the balance issues wouldn't actually help is just begging the question.
---
Says the guy who responded seriously to a joke post...
---
Are you alliance? Heartseeker sucks ass, boo heartseeker, booooo.
---
Are you horde? Listen here, heartseeker is the best server there is. No contending.
---
Sincerely, an alliance player excited for P2.
---
I'm trying not to be judgemental but you're not wrong
---
Do a random temple run or two, but you shouldn't need much gear to really do BRD.
---
The dominate faction has no reason to transfer away. This is why restricting doesn´t do shit.
---
Everything yesacabbagez wrote is correct. But you're right, the heal mechanic and the shadow volley are present throughout the fight. It's just that his enrage mechanic makes the shadow volley go nuts, ultimately utilizing his heal more and makes him unkillable/wiping the raid.
---
I mean I don’t think warmode made balance any better considering alliance has a quest to kill 10 horde a week and receive loot that’s equivalent to the current mythic raid tier.
---
I was thinking more of raids, I got my mage to 60, did my first MC and there was 11 other mages rolling in my gear too Lol
---
It’s odd that you blame the faults of the video game on a single player, or even a group of players. Blizzard has the statistics, and if their current model of faction dominated servers with cross-realm BGs is profitable, they will continue to operate in such a manner, as they have for many years.
---
That’s what happened in tbc... i was one of those hardcore players and still am. You are more than capable of getting gear yourself.
---
Nobody even does it anymore because it’s too far away most people don’t even bother
---
I like how you have to lie about what this is in order to dismiss it. It's not "massive fixes across the board," it's server performance tweaks and optimizations. Go read through patch notes for any game with an online component and you'll see that phrase over and over again. It's entirely normal. And it makes sense to put those optimizations in the patch with world pvp.
---
You are not very smart if you think a survey where nearly half of the respondents have fully cleared MC 2 months after release is representative of the population at large
---
Kill 'em
---
Yes and that panel actively updates when it issues a new /who. I told you what did cause it to initiate a new one, and I told you what didn't. All of those results are from manual clicks on interfaces.
---
Except everything doesn't reward you in an equally shit way in vanilla.
---
The order of rewards goes: Raiding &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; super hardcore PvP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; semi hardcore PvP&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 mans &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anything else.  
---
Vanilla is literally either raid, live your entire life inside of BG's, or don't progress your character.  
---
Where is this freedom I keep hearing about?  You can choose to not progress your character in TBC as well if that is what you call freedom.
---
Trust me, you’ll notice when you get to Gedon.
---
- In Vanilla Horde is much more thematically and aesthetically interesting than modern Horde and vanilla Alliance
---
- Horde is thought to have the better leveling experience in Vanilla, having more zones, better flight points, more quests, better access to dungeons
---
- Horde racials are extremely overhyped in both PvP and PvE
---
When the new models were introduced in the WoD pre-patch they were a toggled option. That option no longer exists in retail. Don't ever open the door to changes with blizzard. You give an inch they take a mile.
---
So for that reason I have to say #NoChanges
---
Ret pal = best class/spec in game
---
Yeah I mean that’s why I prefer classic too. There are no gear shortcuts and the shortcut gear just isn’t as good.
---
On the other hand, by far the easiest way to farm karma in here for a while as "dae slow down and smell the roses and not rush to 60". So you're saying that people upvote the idea of being super casual even if they actually aren't?
---
Sadly cannot upvote multiple times
---
Sorry your boyfriend is having a hard time.  To be honest though, if something like this is going to upset him to that degree, you guys are not playing on the right server.
---
The rest of the gaming community cannot be expected to know or cater to a person playing on a server that allows this kind of interaction getting upset over something that is allowed in the version of the game you guys are all playing.
---
It's cliche as hell, but things will get better.  He needs to put himself in the right environment for getting better though.  Please re-roll your characters on a PvE server.  I really do hope for the best for you both.
---
Have you ever played Counterstrike? You know when you choose a team, and sometimes it says one team is full and you have to join another team? I dont want wow to be like that. Theres no way that you can control who plays what. That's why blizzard doesnt interfere.
---
I don’t trust Blizzard to create a Classic+ that wouldn’t split the fan base.  At least with BC we all know what we’re getting.
---
But you are a part of a mythical platoon that seems to kill everything. Onyxia, Nefarian, Ragnaros, Freaking old god and driving the Scourge away by clearing out Naxxramas and defeating Kel'Thuzad. Absolutely insane feats. The only reason you aren't called a champion etc is because of bad writing. Killing all of these, wearing the most powerful items mortals have ever touched and then being put to collect some devil shit on Hellfire doesn't make any sense.
---
Why’s that? thought not many on either side had taken the bait
---
Yeah, I am sure the relatively small population of pserver veteran who have had their guild rosters filled since launch and hit 60 in the first 2 weeks are the people playing shitty in PUGs, not the overwhelming majority of people who have a mythic+ zerg mindset from retail, how foolish of me.
---
Never heard it before, bet it's great if you know it.
---
Is the lmaoooo a part of the meme too?
---
PvE masterrace.
---
I always say focus the healers or any fear/Mc mechanics.  But that’s from a healer perspective
---
This is the real problem. As a raid tank that doesn't need much from 5 mans anymore, I'm rarely willing to tank for PUGs if I don't have any guaranteed income. Two wipes and any gold I'm making from drops is wiped our by the repair bill. I've even had Strat Live where I reserve first orb and we didn't get a single one, so it actually just cost me gold...setting aside time.
---
Felstriker as Alliance was a terrible experience leveling and max level isn’t much better dungeon groping is hard at 58-60 and so much worse while leveling
---
The way you "solve" n^2 object communications problems in programming is to avoid them completely, make n (in this case, number of players) as small as you can reasonably can, or filter messages between objects. In WoW terms, every one of these solutions would have an impact on gameplay. Look at other MMOs that reduce the radius around your character for who gets loaded in. Look at EVE's "time dilation". Look at how modern WoW uses sharding to partition players. Look at how many MMO-like games that have come out in the last 6 or so years (e.g. Destiny) actually just filter players into open world instances of no more than ~50 players total.
---
Those are the solutions. Not "more hardware and ram".
---
You have to run graveyard, lib, armory and cathedral to get the quest reward.
---
You have to go to travel all the way to desolace and complete a quest chain to get the quest. Then you have to travel all the way back to scarlet monastery (pain in the ass on its own for alliance) and run graveyard, library, armory (You don't get anything from _any_ of these dungeons aside from a completely sacred DO NOT ROLL on dagger that drops almost every time.)
---
*THEN* you have to find a group willing to take you to fucking cathedral at 34 (or lower since a lot of people run gy / lib at 30-33).
---
Then you can get your dagger.
---
***Or*** you can tell /u/daveynjones317 to suck your dick and if he can't handle spending another 20-40 minutes in lib to get his upgrade he doesn't have to group with you ever again. And honestly, you'd both probably have a better time for it.
---
I think if they simply did this, there would be no issues:
---
Server A has server imbalance favoring horde. Horde from server A are allowed free transfers to servers b, c, and d because those servers are balanced favoring Alliance.
---
You don't know by how much. 
---
All they'd have to do is say they will be "offering free transfers to certain servers based on the following criteria: Your faction, and the servers population."
---
They wouldn't even have to acknowledge it's for server balance. They could even alternatively say it's to help low pop servers.
---
It's percentage based, so no. 1/10, 10/100, 100/1000 all mean you need to be better than 90% of the population.
---
I don't see it happening but I'd still prefer it over tbc.
---
Blaumeux seems perfect to me not sure why someone would transfer
---
It depends on how complete some of the classic+ content is. Like we know the Dragon Isles were cut from the original. If they were like 75% complete and sitting on a hard drive somewhere I would trust them to be able to polish it and release it as a "what if" sort of thing. But I absolutely don't trust them to build new classic content from scratch.
---
Thank you for the tips kind stranger! I actually use the 5 second rule addon since I'm in and out of forms a lot while solo questing/farming (along with druid bar that shows your mana while in a cat/bear form). Nothing while in form triggers casting, including faerie fire (feral) from what I've seen. But being able to calculate my mana regen with your calc will be super helpful, especially when I have the 15% while casting talent. Makes it super easy to compare spirit to mp5
---
I think it should a “dlc” like it was before but free.  Just knowing your have a certain amount of time until it launches.  No reason splitting the fanbase of classic in two different set of servers
---
Many people may believe retail has gone to shit - that's fair. 
---
I personally believe that retail hasn't necessarily gone down in overall quality - but instead has changed so much that it no longer appeals to the same players that it did 15 years ago. So, it's not that Classic is successful because it's "better", classic is successful because it's an entirely different game which has already proven successful in the past.
---
Blizzard is essentially operating two independently successful games which share the same world/story.
---
So would it people rather play with the community they’ve built or with their character names?
---
As alliance is like to see them put the wildhammer rep to use. Maybe at exalted you unlock a quest chain where you save more griffons. And the reward is a wing clipped griffon. Give us a rescue that was hurt during the quest line and that becomes our mount. Maybe have a different aesthetic choices to choose to rescue so there’s multiple variations and you can still have the attachment of the one you get as a reward being the same look as the one you saved.
---
50-60s sounds about right. 
---
definitely some realllly low roll runs tho
---
In addition to the points made here about flat numbers, being on the overpopulated faction means long queues when bgs come out.
---
Yes i know. Thats why he responded to me because he realized how it reads. People are gonna engage him without shadow pots snd get wiped lol.
---
Very well said, I wish I could up-vote this more because you made great points that brought us into BFA.
---
 I am enjoying MC and our guild is getting enough players where we might even feild two teams. I can't wait for the next raid and beyond. I haven't really thought about going to BfA and am unsure I will venture into the Shadowlands. I feel back at home in Classic and I would love for Classic+ where they keep the integrity of the game while adding more lore/content and finishing things they never had a chance to back then.
---
I feel no reason to rush the Classic experience only for them to bastardize it and make the same mistakes all over again.
---
Molten Core is challenging
---
It was an upgrade for atleast 2 people in the raid, I would say they needed it.
---
But you should know the odds of lower numbers means higher varience. It's easier for a dedicated player to be rank 1 amongst 9 randoms than rank 1 amongst 999 randoms. Simply put, if you are in the top 1% of players, the chances of you being rank 1 are higher in a room of 10 players than in a room of 10,000 players. 
---
Also you grossly overestimate the problem solving skills of a 5 year old.
---
Man you really could have simply not made this post. Like why not go play retail when it very obviously, even by your own admission, has what youre seeking? Instead youre doing what ive seen *so* many other posts do, which is ask that the game caters to their weird needs.  
---
Rank 14 is held in such high regard *because* of how absurdly difficult it is to obtain. If you made it easier then you remove that status. People like classic because of how hard gear is to get in the first place because it makes things more rewarding, that is the same reasoning behind the honor system and achieving rank 14, you are literally asking to remove that.  
---
Seriously retail is *right there* for you. Go play it.
---
They don’t call me the other slayer for nothin’.
---
What actions?
---
I think it mainly depends on the time/golds you are willing to invest.
---
Mining only require time to be maxed, where alchemy mostly requires compos and recipes.
---
About goldmaking, alchemy can guarantee you 5 to 20g every 2 days through transmutations. Altough you are going to need sone rare recipes if you are willing to make good gold out of this profession.
---
On the other hand mining can simply improve your herbalism farming time. And it's a quite reliable way to make gold.
---
To summarize : 
---
-if you are already spending a couple hours farming herbs and only aim at maxing ypur golds, go for mining.
---
-if you are willing to guarantee yourself a minimal income, already have rare alchemy pattern, or simply want to be able to craft your own potions, go for alchemy.
---
Skeram doesn't have a queue nor multiple layers. So how does opening transfers solve a queue problem that doesn't exist? They are just screwing my server over because it has a high population. Nevermind that that population is mostly horde. As if they'd leave to go to a completely dead horde server full of alliance raiding guilds (heartseeker) or go to a server that is dead on both side (Arcanite Reaper). Skeram shouldn't have transfers open, bottom line. Horde character creation should be disabled. Either roll alliance or pick a difference server.
---
Not waiting a gcd per mob before aoe is 110% clown behavior
---
Yeah, throwing my 2c in here, I am a level 51 warrior, I would love smaller pulls of only 2-3 mobs, after ZF they basically don't exist
---
It's because I presented a solution to the insufficient data problem but you wanted to compound on the "insufficient" part. There's a solution, and you spreading bullshit that the solution doesn't work is false.
---
Now get punked and welcome to my block list.
---
Retail WoW got worse and worse year after year for a reason. Many design mistakes and decisions have been made over the years that ruined the game.
---
Payed character transfer and faction change is one of those things. Yeah I know it is so convenient to just pay 20 bucks and transfer to a realm where the grass is greener for your faction. But is that really the right decision for the overall enjoyment and health of the game? History has shown that it isn't.
---
It's like Blizzard did not learn from the mistakes of the past. We have a 2nd chance here. Another shot at not gradually ruining the WoW experience year after year. Can we please not, Blizzard?
---
I think the guaranteed kills and easy questing outweigh that.
---
Because Blizzard is a multibillion company and we should expect it to handle wow better than pservers. It's really that simple. a few hundred players sending numbers at each other should be fixed and working after 15 years of technological progress. Let's stop making excuses for Blizzard incompetence. They haven't even fixed feign death or vanish.
---
Fuck off zoomer
---
Oh I agree. The old honor system, especially once BGs release, is entirely biased towards those who can play the most and nothing more. Rank 14 will go to pre determined people in big guilds who grind 18 hours a day and/or account share to basically never stop.
---
Gaining points that you can spend on gear once you reach enough is a much better system and a lot closer to how PvE progression works... the best and most dedicated players will be kitted our much sooner but those who show up consistently will eventually be able to get everything they have.
---
But it’s almost certainly not going to change, so if you can’t have fun with the old system that sucks but such is life.
---
That's the entire point you dingus---To use queues to gradually pressure players into moving to a server without them.
---
Yes, It'll take time but that's another of its strengths---It lessens the impact on server identity and community by having players move and integrate in a steady stream rather than in giant crushing waves.
---
That's the one.
---
But it scales with spell damage, not AP.
---
Oh noo some random moron on reddit is blocking me
---
&gt; Both horde and alliance both want relatively balanced pvp servers for the most fun for both sides.
---
Yeah, that's exactly what we're seeing come out of the transfer process. Server transfers aren't even about faction balance to start with.
---
You should be begging Blizzard for an option to faction change for horde &gt; alliance only on servers with massive balance issues.
---
My guild is just a bunch of tryhards so yeah that's what they all suggest lol
---
taking advantage of free transfers offered by Blizzard in a way that exacerbates faction imbalances instead of reducing them.
---
The very thing the OP wants to stop.
---
I just want off of Thalnos for 2 reasons. 1) I am a pariah on this server because I speak my mind. 2) There are a brazillion brazilians.
---
Quite the opposite experience here.
---
Deep Prot warriors have threat issues from what I’ve witnessed. I rarely, if ever, have threat issues. Fury/Prot has so much threat output that a good tank shouldn’t have any issues holding threat.
---
I played the shit out of SWG(I completed a set of Mandalorian armor...I lived in The Deathwatch Bunker for months) and Lineage 2 before WoW.  
---
SWG was a sandbox MMO, WoW was literally never anything like that.  Vanilla is no more like SWG than TBC is, in fact I would argue it is even less like it, as the ways available to you to progress your character are fewer in vanilla than in TBC.  
---
The NGE happened before TBC was launched, SWG's attempt to mimic WoWs success was it trying to copy vanilla.  Yet I have people trying to tell me that vanilla is more like SWG pre-NGE than post?  Is that some kind of joke?
---
World PvP was absolutely destroyed by BG's, don't kid yourself. Tarren Mill stopped regularly being a bloodbath when BG's came out, because any hardcore PvPer was far better off in BG's than world PvP.  You could not grind rank10+ in world PvP once BG's came out, it was literally impossible.  
---
You are absolutely wrong on basically every point in your post.  Well done.
---
bad meme
---
Seal of Wisdom is great for AoE threat. Seal of Wisdom is affected by Imp Righteous Fury. I think mana gained is a 1.0 threat and would be 1.9 with Imp RF. 
---
I judge righteousness, drop consecration, SoW and auto attack till end of fight. On longer fight I might use another Consecration or if there are lots of mobs I might drop some rank 1 consecration. Usually leave fights with 75% + mana. 
---
Bosses are another story. Let me know if you know how to hold aggro on a boss!
---
Gtd will be leashed to blasted lands
---
Well, you're not, not by that stage.  You have the druids of the cenarion circle telling you to avoid the pirates in the barrens not out of concern, but because they'll be a waste of your time.
---
Not everyone can leave though and even if they do they also fuck the balance of the server they leave to. The problem could be so much easier solved by Blizzard restricting server transfers and/or adding incentives to balance out server populations (e.g. faction specific queue times)
---
I just want to move my alliance characters from Deviate Delight to Grobbulus and vice versa
---
I mean they don’t have zero reasons to do it. They just have may more realms not to do it. They’re not going to dig up 15 year old development tools to build new content with old fashioned graphics and they’re not going to update all the models in the game to conform to new graphics. and that’s just one of a million reasons why classic+ just isn’t feasible. It’s a nice idea though.
---
Dead on imo. I enjoyed the 40 man raids in vanilla but became disinterested in BC raiding between this and the arrival of pvp resilience gear. I didn't feel like putting in the extra effort in harder raid encounters when most of the gear wasn't really needed for pvp and arenas.
---
Why not allow once only faction changes. From the dominate faction to the lesser. Until it's 50/50 and end it. Seems simple enough but I guess that was not in vanilla so no changes right
---
Elemental water, elemental earth, jujus, free action potions, restorative potions.
---
if you learn nothing else at least please be certain that ONLINE POLLS (especially with a very specific demographics like this sub) have no relation to reality. like ever.
---
I've taken census on several servers and the level 60s range from 30% to an absolute max of 40%. this is very consistent across servers, factions and time of day
---
I just don't understand it honestly. Alliance players should be grateful that so many horde exist on their server! It reminds me of a time, my now wife, switched to an open relationship, technically it is still open. She would come in with troves of men every week, occasionally some women. Most of the time I would have to take out the cot and sleep next to the bed, since it was so packed. Basically, the Horde may think they have the upper hand in this wPvP situation, but it will be easier for us alliance players to get Rank 14.
---
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about if you think prot was viable in TBC. Please find me a legitimate source (PvP video at high level rating, etc.) that supports your claim that prot was viable in arena. I also know you have no idea what you are talking about because you think DKs existed in BC.
---
Drastically oversimplifying the issue.
---
The issue is there are more horde across all servers than there are alliance. Meaning even with a perfect distribution of players it will be like 60% horde every server.
---
The only real way to fix faction balance is for horde players to roll alliance.
---
Are BGs cross realm? Otherwise good luck finding a BG on a server where your faction is 90% of the players.
---
That episode is actually really good. I’m not normally one for SP but I must concede it was well done
---
This is more like a zoomer post.
---
Queues should have been faction-specific since launch. How could they possibly make anything worse?
---
Half the work? Blizzard might literally have a million times the resources that pservers run out of some euro's basement does. stfu stop making excuses. It's been 15 freaking years, we should have 200 ppl casting numbers at each other without the game taking a dump.
---
MORGOOOO -stooped
---
Ret damage is pretty much all about autoswing and seal of command. Both of those scale with physical stats.
---
You need weapon skill (if possible, very rare stat), hit, crit/agi and ap/str. Mana stats are useless, since you regen more mana than you use for damage (thanks to JoW).
---
Except that’s not true. Most people who’s faction outnumbers the other greatly don’t want that to change. Hugely overpopulated servers that have transfers opened up just become more imbalanced as the lower faction gets the fuck out of the hell they’re in and the other complains they have nobody to kill.
---
Seriously... if they opened up the option would you swap a near PvE experience for being ganked and corpse camped daily in the hopes enough others would pick it and eve it out? Or would you quietly stay and hope that other people took that option for you?
---
But you don't have to be #1, you have to be in a top percentage.  You're the one making a false analogy.  And being percentage based makes size irrelevant because the winning pool increases in size just as fast.  It's really very, very, basic math.
---
Yeah there we so many changes in TBC that had huge unforeseen negative effects on the game. The world already at that point became a series of content portals.
---
&gt; I’ve already seen multiple scumbags talking about setting up a kill trading system where they just keep ressing with a healer getting X amount of HK’s per minute. 
---
There is a decay in the amount of honor you gain from killing the same person. After 10 kills its gives nothing and the total honor gained from spawnkilling someone 10 times is only like 3-4 honor kills worth. Now it's still good but it takes a LOT of characters willing to be honorfarmed to make any difference. This is also VERY easily detected by both other players(who will do anything to get other rankers banned), and by blizzard looking at logs.
---
&gt;competition, que times, and lag 
---
Competition sure. Queue times should not be a factor. All the rankers will know at what times the queue starts and work out when to sleep and when to log in to pvp, and there's many ways to log in early and stay online to completely skip queues.
---
As for accountsharing, it's possible. Usually this stuff is fairly easy to track for both other players who find it suspicious how someone changes playstyle or tone in chat etc. and also fairly easy for blizzard to check, but good account sharing is almost impossible to track so it could be an issue. HOWEVER i don't know how many people actually want to  share an account for 3 months, im sure there will be some but it won't be "all rank 14s"
---
But yes all this depends on the ranking community being good at reporting suspicious rankers, and blizzard actually reading the reports
---
On a low level warrior?  Good fucking luck.
---
This guy is arguing in favor of server health.  Server health trumps not wanting to pvp on a pvp server.
---
You pick a server not knowing the ratio, you hope it's close to even as possible.  You pick pvp knowing you will have to fight.
---
When you end up having to fight, you shouldn't be allowed to just abandon your decision WITHOUT starting from scratch.
---
Honestly get a free transfer and run.  Not sure why anyone rolls on Faerlina unless they are a streamer or Fanboi of those streamers.
---
It dropped from boss, not from skinning it. Its not pristine hide of the beast (which is another item from the dog boss in ubrs)
---
Pally main here, love ret but I understand wanting to be “actually useful”
---
I don’t have numbers but for healing you just need the right gear, and a good few points in holy. Sadly it’s time consuming collecting the gear to heal, pvp, and quest but you can stick with one build
---
Holy talents:
---
Divine 5/5 int, 5/5 improved seal of righteousness, 3/3healing light, 2/2 improved lay on hands, 5/5 illumination. 
---
You can dip 8 points into prot for 3% hit but going all in on ret, and getting your hit from gear is better. For ret talents skip seal of command, improved seal of the crusader, and whatever is to the left of conviction
---
I wish they would allow faction changes. I would be on Ally in a heart beat to even the ration. I wanted to world pvp not just run past 10 horde to find one Ally
---
They really should just release paid server transfers and let people sort it out themselves. But honestly doing these free transfers right before phase 2 is going to ruin what little world pvp there was going to be. Only good server seems to be faerlina which sucks.
---
You're clearly someone who just wants to complain and will do whatever mental gymnastics needed to allow you to do so. Have a nice life kid.
---
&gt; Horde on overpopulated servers: HAHAHA RED IS DEAD FUCK OFF IF YOU DONT LIKE BEING CAMPED FOR HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY!
---
lmao skeram
---
Ok bro.  Well why don't you do a little research on this new thing called the internet and let me know what you find.  See if you can find some other players who understand the rank system Dynamics on unbalanced servers.
---
If you can't trust your guildies to not collude(have a rule against it), then why the fuck are you in guild with them?
---
Those are the key binds I have set up. The lower action bar is form specific and the upper one stays the same so I have healing stuff up top and the form abilities on the second bar. The S means shift  healing touch is SE Shift+E. Obviously those don’t work in form but out of form they do. In order to do this I just shifted to each form and then placed the abilities where I wanted them. They keys always stay the same in cat E is claw and in bear E is maul in caster form E is wrath. I would highly suggest playing and yes there are so many abilities that you need to start putting modifiers on them using shift or control.
---
I made alliance on argual :)
---
People here act as if Classic is 1000 times better than retail. It isn't. I enjoy Classic. The Leveling, Professions are useful, and eventually the Non Timer Warsong, 2k Point Arathi Basins, and Endless AV. Gear in Classic actually has a Best in Slot (Fixable). Raiding and Mythic + are far more fun for PVE content than any of the Classic Material will have that is currently designed.
---
But, there are more raids coming. There is something to look forward to. Once you have Naxx on farm, there is nothing coming after to get gear for. The only exception would be if they announce Classic+.
---
Thought bgs we're going to be cross realm?
---
This would be pointless.
---
No ones going to transfer from the dominate faction to a server where they are outnumbered.
---
Oh, it is. I want more horde for P2...
---
Because the point of these transfers isn't to create faction balance. Blizzard is trying to make their larger servers smaller by letting people on big servers transfer to small servers. 
---
Combining two low pop servers into one high pop server is literally the opposite of what Blizzard wants to happen.
---
Yeah, the emulated 1.12 server is doing virtually zero load compared to the current 1.13. Sorry you can't understand this.
---
What about #nochanges ?
---
Oh yes most definitely. The wiping on him is certainly very snowbally, punishing, however you want address it. I'm really looking forward to seeing how it will play out. On the more-or-less evebly-factioned servers anyway.
---
Kinda regretted moving to Bloodfang when it first opened but now im so glad i did it, the faction split and population is very healthy now. You can always find a group to do things with while at the same time get questmobs and recources out in the world with low competition from other players
---
They need to release a game like Warhammer End Times Vermintide, but in the Starcraft Universe. I would play the absolute shit out of that. Play as Terran or Protoss fighting hordes of Zerg? Yes please!
---
dam i went the way around &gt;&lt;
---
since argual has more horde though, once i reach lvl 60 will i have more fun since i would see more horde around? or just more likely to get killed heaps? &gt;&lt;
---
I played alliance on another eu unbalanced server. When the add on worked it reported 68% hoard. 
---
That’s 2 horde  for each alliance.  
---
It was so bad that in the 20-30 zones lv40+ on mounts was corps camping and just forget fleeing as they was riding.  Once you hit lv30 you went from gear1 to full stop. So I rerolled on another server.  
---
I shed no tears over those asholes going to have a Shitty phase2. 
---
While on my new server its better ballanced  am
---
Is that an add on to add class color to name in chat or is that a setting in chat window?
---
Mirahs song is better than dal rends tribal guardian by itself?
---
I was gonna post this earlier haha
---
Because it’s obvious? If the server capacity is 10k (for example) and there’s 2 layers with 5k each, the removal of layers should make the 10k players be in a universal same layer.....It’s their decision to not do this.
---
Not interested in what retail did to overall gameplay - especially class homogenization.  
---
You misunderstand me, however, concerning Rank 14. I don't want it since I won't be worthy. What I'm getting at is how the system in classic demands a certain level of dedication for even the lower tier stuff, and that it's unsatisfactory to think one might not play for a week due to more important commitments, and ultimately lose out on where they'd worked up to previously. I'm not against challenge, or rewarding people for their time and dedication, but more discussing that the minimum threshold required to be at least somewhat competitive is ultimately let down by a system that actively works against you.  
---
  Classic: Play 30 hours one week, get your honor, get your rank. Miss one week - lose your rank, have to spend more time trying to earn it back just to be able to access basic gear.
---
Retail: Play 30 hours, hold honor, miss week and still have honor that will eventually afford gear since it doesn't vanish.
---
Also Classic: Run tons of dungeons for PVE rewards that you may or may not receive, in order to be competitive in PVP if you can't access the gear, but ultimately spend your time doing something you don't want (PVE) to make 'progress' in PVP.
---
I completed the Smithing Tuyere quest in SG and was able to do the Gnomeregan teleport-quest.
---
If people wanted to avoid PVP, they probably should have rolled on a PvE server.
---
Well anyone still on these servers has had 2 chances to drop to a non queue server already, but if they are horde sure you can dodge the queue and jump on another server. Or you can introduce a faction queue which is also a good option.
---
Sure bro, and while we're at it maybe you can go learn some basic math and stop being ignorant.
---
Yeah if the only change was to bring in class balance then I would support classic + even more. More raids would be cool too but they’re not going to dig up 15 year old development tools to build new content with old graphics (and they aren’t going to update all the existing graphics either). 
---
Maybe like a WoW classic remastered that was a total rebuild of a vanilla-like world with modern graphics and new content instead of new expansions to retail (just let retail die. it’s too bloated to ever be saved now).
---
The already confirmed they will be.
---
Classic+? Sure
---
Tbc without flying mounts, badges, or resilience? hell yes
---
Tbc? Eeeeh I'll take it.
---
Blizzard implodes and private servers take over again? &lt;--- this one has my vote
---
Why is everyone assuming they will keep classic servers if they release TBC?
---
Heartseeker could benefit from some alliance leaving. Unfortunately I dont see that happening lol.
---
Because I want to do Karazhan at 60. 
---
Because I want to see what Grim Batol would've been like in classic. 
---
Because I want to fight through the hordes of demons in south Winterspring and throughout Hyjal at 60. 
---
Because I want to see what Timbermaw Hold looks like, their real stronghold in Azshara, not the small cave between Felwood/Moonglade/Winterspring. 
---
Because I want to see Uldum - No, not the "Uldum" that we got in Cataclysm, the one we were promised at the end of the Disks of Norgannon quest chain, the Titan Arcvive, the Titan Workshop. 
---
I want to see more quests in Azshara. 
---
I want to see the areas east and west of Burning Steppes.
---
I want to see the area to the east of Wetlands.
---
I want Gilneas to open up in Classic.
---
There is so much room on classic Azeroth to fill with content that fits the style of Classic gameplay and balance.
---
No, the Domo chest doesn't work the same. The Hunter you want to sell it to must be present for the fight. Just have one of your Hunters who already have the leaf step out for the fight.
---
Do the missing diplomat quest line, it explains everything. Also Nobbel on YouTube has a pretty good video about all of it.
---
I see so many people talking about horde just killing every alliance 5v1 on Herod by my experience was completely different. As a horde leveling on Herod in the first 2 weeks I always felt like there was ALWAYS several Alliance around and ready to kill me and that there wasn't as many Horde (Again from my experience). However it does seem to have changed now as I see many more Horde than Alliance running around.
---
Faction changes. Once and only dominate faction. That would solve it but no changes.
---
People around here assuming things and presenting them as facts?
---
I'm gonna need some proof on that one, bub.
---
not actual classic subscription numbers, or mb I missed them
---
It has nothing to do with inactives, so I'm not sure what you're mentioning that.  
---
I'm not naive enough to think you're ever going to get 50/50 servers, because the overall wow population tends to favor Horde for various reasons that have been discussed to death on retail reddit/forums. We've known this for years and we knew Classic would tilt Horde.  That said, there is *no reason* Blizzard shouldn't have prepared for what they *knew* would happen in Classic since it's already happened in Retail.  If they had simply installed faction-specific queue times AND faction-specific realm transfers from DAY ONE that allowed every server to be at worst 60/40, they would have taken a HUGE step in the right direction with Classic.  Yes, Horde players would bear the brunt of the queue times, but they would know this going in and would have the choice to either try another server or try Alliance out.  It would have been such a positive change for the short- and long-term health of Classic, and I guarantee you'd start to see Retail players clamoring for the same treatment.
---
The majority of servers in vanilla were 5 guilds total clearing end game content between the two factions.
---
Often times you had maybe 2-3 guilds that were doing it.
---
Hell I am not even certain 5 guilds cleared Naxx on the BATTLEGROUP we were in, because there literally were not enough well geared warriors on the server to reliably do 4h even when you consolidated them.
---
Dead server IS an exaggeration, those "dead servers" are the equivalent of high pop vanilla servers. The idea of a DOZEN of raid guilds for a faction only really came about in expansions as good players transferred to those servers (like Zul'Jin for horde).
---
Hell if a guild has two raid groups in classic they may have as many end game raiders as a lot of the low/medium pop vanilla servers had for a whole faction.
---
Humblebrag post
---
...caster gear?
---
Idk, some of the equip only gives +healing, not +spellpower for heal/dmg.
---
why are elemental earth and elemental water good to save for Naxx?
---
I'm Horde and want to move off Skeram too, but I can't convince my guild (or even just the few RL friends I have in that guild) to move.
---
Or the same art style, as the case may be.
---
Yes exactly I’ve only met nice ones once or twice .. ganked in moonglade and redridge by them a lot though
---
I want to keep the 40man raiding in tact.
---
literally doesn't matter, you will find guilds that raid on all hours on either timezone
---
I can confirm that it does proc off of mindvision. And yes... many shenanigans have been had.
---
People wouldn’t see as light at the end of the tunnel. They would see it as prison they can’t escape from.
---
If they announce a TBC where your Classic character is transferred forward, I will definitely be hitting 60 to be ready.
---
I play Ally on Stalagg and watched the balance shift from 60/40 H/A to at least 75/25 H/A (or whatever it is now) when they introduced Xfers because people were having a hard time leveling. I would watch people discuss leaving in world chat through the various zones. If they don't make the xfers faction specific a few realms have potential to die. Then what?
---
It's because people like him are clearly invested in Classic failing.
---
A ton of people spouting that "bbbbbut i thought #nochanges amirite guys?" crap seem to take great satisfaction in shit going south and get butthurt over any solution that would solve the problem without having to resort to drastic sweeping changes.
---
They act like just because they had 250~1500ms at all times that every single player had massive unstable latency (Even though latency varied wildly depending on where you lived, what internet speeds you had access to, how far you were from the datacenter, and when you were playing)
---
They act like just because they had to stare at the ground in org/ironforge to get more than 10fps that nobody could get more than that (even though any mid-range gaming PC was able to max it out and get 60fps in raids and BGs)
---
They act like just because their server was an unbalanced shithole then every server was an unbalanced shithole (Even though the majority were under 60:40 and only a tiny handful reached 80:20 or greater.
---
They act like because servers occasionally had periods where they'd shit the bed for a couple hours and during certain major releases, everyone experienced dozens of crashes every day for the entirety of vanilla
---
My server is PvP and a 50/50 balance. Grob Mob!
---
Its should proc off of everything, fear, dots etc. It only procs off the initial cast though.
---
Sulfuras for sure my east coast brother
---
The thing is no miner is ever going to want to split since that's the most lucrative part.
---
Could be some casual guilds that dont care. I know a few guilds that dont bother uploading ony logs.
---
I play on a pretty balanced server almost perfect 50/50 too....
---
Can't imagine how it is to be alli on herod.
---
Faction queues MIGHT have helped but it needed to have been done at launch. The rest will not fix anything, because players on overpopulated factions have no interest in switching factions or servers.
---
The in only solutions blizzard will ever implement are server merges and putting phasing/sharing/whatever the hell its called when people from other servers all play together in various areas... something people also don’t want.
---
You can get to 60 solo without ever grouping up with anyone or doing a dungeon. Hell, you could get to 60 and never even see a roll popup because you weren't in a group when anything dropped
---
I guess he means for "Greater Frost Protection Potion", but only a few bosses need those. There will never be a shortage like for the other Elementals. So i don't know?
---
Arena run is referring to the Ring of Law ( which you can probably find in a guide). All that is required for an arena run is to enter the instance and go through the 3 locked doors on your left. Once you are through the 3rd door go up the stairs and jump into in the Ring of Law. Walk into the center and fight the boss there.
---
In the arena it's random which boss you fight but it can be any of these bosses:
---
* Gorosh The Dervish
---
* Anub'shiah
---
* Eviscerator
---
* Grizzle
---
* Hedrum the Creeper
---
* Ok'thor the Breaker
---
Then run out of the instance and do it again!
---
People also do Arena / Angerforge run where when you exit the arena you follow the path till General Angerforge and kill him then run out and restart. 
---
Since you're only allowed to do 5 instances an hour people do anger force to waste time since you can do a arena / angerforge run in about 10-15 mins.
---
all the pvp racials? escape artist is excellent, stoneform is also really good. Escape artist is arguably as good as WOTF.

I think you mean to say that the odds of him getting it on his 600th run are the same as on his first run. His odds of getting it *within* the *next 600 runs* is phenomenally higher than within his first run.
---
I know, I'm saying they've destroyed it again. Cross-realm was their solution and it failed.
---
Btw

So just wear my ret gear even if I have some epic healing gear, regardless if I don't have Command procs?
---
&gt;Mana stats are useless since you regen more mana than you use for damage (thanks to JoW).
---
I was fighting some undead in EPL and that actually seemed good - I was able to constantly be judging, having consecrate down, holy wratch, exorcism, holy shock and not running out of mana.
---
So why don’t big horde guilds transfer to alliance dominated servers then?
---
Is all of this possible to tank at 52?
---
&gt;Most people who’s faction outnumbers the other greatly don’t want that to change.
---
Add faction based queues and see how that changes VERY quickly for most of the playerbase.
---
Someone couldn't get into BRD lol
---
So. I've on several occasions had someone tried to tell me that while pve classic content is easy, the real skill is in player vs player battles.
---
Clearly.
---
&gt; Yes but classic doesn't rely on well tuned pve content to be fun. Raiding is a side attraction in classic, something you do to get gear for pvp. It's the main show in BC.
---
Everything there's in classic there's in TBC and more. You can't say "oh bro it's the leveling experience" when TBC leveling is the exact same but plus 10 levels that's by far the slowest in the game.
---
Ill second thise, simply put we have many guilds on both sides raiding at all different hours, even have pugs running the weekends. Very active server.
---
Dope
---
im probably completely wrong here but dont we need frost resist gear for Sapphiron ?
---
Idk man... my faction seems like a bunch of pussies... they see you getting 2v1'd and run right past like they are fucking blind.
---
Only wows biggest quarter since ever due to Classic according to the earnings call that just came out.. but definitely dying lol
---
I think a lot of Horde would switch to alliance, they just aren't going to reroll and start at lvl 1 which is reasonable.
---
&gt; Arena sucked.
---
How come?

As I anticipate most tanks will want to know who in their guild they can use for Ony cheese, I modified the existing scripts to output a list into chat of everyone in your guild who has a lower GUID than you.  Hope you find this helpful.
---
/run g1 = {GetNumGuildMembers()}; g2 = tonumber(g1[1]); i=1 repeat local info = {GetGuildRosterInfo(i)}; if info[17] &lt; UnitGUID("player") then DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(info[1]) DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(info[17]) end  i=i+1 until i&gt;g2
---
Roll pve and quit bitching then
---
Lol, you're clearly someone who just wants to defend blizzard no matter what and will do whatever mental gymnastics needed to allow you to do so. Have a nice life kid.
---
Please do explain how optimisation will change their entire server structure which is built entirely around layers and being able to offload as much as possible onto different layers to prevent lag, instead of ramping up server power to handle sudden massive increases in demand.
---
Great, thank you !

Have an upvote

Yes ironfoe allows u to speak dwarfish
---
I live near Michigan and play in a European server.
---
Ping is not a problem, but are you sure you can make raid times? They almost all start at 7pm or 8pm server time for Ashbringer.
---
Heartseeker isnt any better since its alliance dominated.
---
Bro you just listed how you can actively participate in pvp to stay competitive, if you cant pvp all the time to get r14, then do dungeons/raids, get geared that way. Yet somehow this is still unsatisfactory because **you** personally dislike doing dungeons? Again man, retail sounds like it has what you need.
---
Because I replied to your provocative comment? Ok buddy, seek help.
---
I would tolerate neither.
---
Probably skip playing so obessively during the first week when the game was unplayable and had heavy queues.
---
I healed as a circle of LOL priest in TBC and I've been healing Onyxia and MC in Classic. Healing is like the lowest stress job when things are going well and highest stress when things turn to shit. I honestly have the most fun goofing off in raids since party chat let's me shit talk with other party members, or in the guild specific chat channel.. it is not very glamorous but it is a super necessary role. If you are the MT of a guild or is super shitry when you do not show up. If you are the tenth healer they can survive without you. If you are a priest you can become a stupidly great PVP asset when you do not have to have. 
---
Goofing off in a raid is possible when there are lots of healers and you are on point.healing in a raid with raid damage is infinitely more interesting than spamming shadow bolt or four different abilities ad nauseam. Onyxia has chaotic damage coming in which allows that predictive healing come into play  and
---
Yep, alliance is the true pvp faction and has been for a while.  No OP racials and less players.  Real pvpers want to be the underdog, not the zerg faction.  But even this has to be within reason, no one wants to play on a faction that has &lt;10% of the realm pop because that's not pvp, that's rape.
---
the guild might not care, sure. many don't even have "official" wowprog pages / calendars.
---
But you cannot find 40 people that refuse to log. the vast bulk of wowprogress reports is "personal" logs, but those still end up in the guild stats if enough people in the run are from same guild.
---
Clearly, you're an inferior, low-effort species of troll.
---
Know your betters.
---
Arena only should be pretty easy to tank at level 52. Angerforge is level 57 and would require a good group if you wanted to tank at level 52.

Here are some *generalizations* which hold true:
---
- girls tend to be distracting.
---
- girls tend to be annoying.
---
- when someone is playing like they're new but they're level 50 and they're glued to the side of a much better level 50 player, whaddya know... it's someone's wife. I love (hate) when scrubs get carried through the game and then completely and utterly lack in 5-man content.
---
Yeah I understand everything I mention can be applied to male players, too. Just making some broad generalizations, but I would not be here with my two cents if I didn't truly feel this way.
---
Better gear how? I'm not familiar. I do know that ally I better in pve because pallies are OP.
---
I never really understood the Horde boner, or those very loud ones you see everywhere (including here).
---
I play horde on Arugal, you're going to be camped non stop. Especially in the following weeks, there will be no mercy. I've seen a LOT of discussions about it in guild chat, trade chat, and general chat.
---
I think the idea of classic+ is highly unlikely. People use OSRS as an example, but the levels of complexity between the two games is vast, and the development costs even larger. If they roll out a TBC classic they make money hand over fist with VERY little effort. The major criticisms of TBC (flying, dailies, catch up badge gear, lack of world pvp) is either a small issue, or wasnt an actual problem at the time. Let's look at lack of world pvp for example and flying mounts being the main criticism for the lack thereof. By the end of Vanilla people were botting in BGs and leaching honor. There was no real world pvp. There was forum post after forum post waxing nostalgia about south shore vs Tarren mill in 2006. The opening of the portal, and shuffling us all through into one zone to quest made for massive pvp those first few weeks. The addition of meeting stones also led to groups of players pvping for long lengths of time in order to control them, with pvp also happening around daily quest locations. World pvp didnt disappear. It just changed how it happened. If anything TBC saw a return of it more so than the last roughly year of vanilla. 
---
Let me touch on dailies now- 
---
First, I hated them. I rarely if ever did them back then and you have far better opportunities to make gold doing other things if you understand the TBC economy. Thankfully though there arent very many of them in TBC. If you dont like them (and most of us dont) then dont do them.
---
Catch up badge gear- if we look at badge gear in TBC, it comes really in two waves. The first, was available at release with items like Bloodlust broach. Most of this gear was only ever so slightly better than heroic gear with Kara gear being better than or equal to it. The second wave of badge gear which saw things like the xbow added weren't added until very late in TBC. By then, if you were doing higher raid content, the badge gear was either a downgrade, or a side grade at best to what was already available to you. For those still stuck doing Kara and the occasional Mag or Gruul's pug they were an upgrade. But they weren't entire sets of upgrades, the cost of them was high, and what were you going to do with them anyways, pug Kara faster? And sure, ZA had catch up gear too, but people forget that those encounters required groups that were at least in some T5 gear already to competently complete. 
---
So for me, all the criticisms of TBC are counterable for the most part. Whereas Classic + just doesnt make sense to me. I really dont understand the idea of trusting the current development team to essentially make a brand new wow that costs millions in development money and years worth of time, without Activision-blizzard shareholders trying to fill it with microtransactions. Not to mention they'd essentially have to run 3 fully seperate WoW based projectsv(classic, classic plus, and retail). They would be better off putting that development money into trying to fix retail (which is what it appears they're trying to do now).
---
Again, for the time and money investment they would be better served doing TBC, then Wrath, and then having the community vote on whether to start back over again, do a + type game, or continue into Cata (my least favorite concept).
---
mAyBe pVp IsN't fOr u bRo - every hordie when you try to have a discussion about faction imbalance on the toxic herod sub.
---
What????
---
&gt; it will be like 60% horde every server.
---
So? Oh noes it can only be 60/40 at best, let's completely ignore faction balance and let it get out of control so every server is 90/10? What the fuck kind of solution is this? Did someone inject something into your head to dissolve your brain?
---
Ik. But idk if the mobs will be green or not. If they are that's great. I'm a mage so I can aoe farm
---
It’s this kinda thinking that led to retail though. “I don’t like this portion of the game but I want equal rewards to those who do it”. Then Blizzard says “Ok here you go” and now everybody has epics and looks the same. 
---
The good gear is deep in blackrock mountain. You need to travel far with a big group to get it. And you only get a few pieces per week so there’s a limit. You only need to raid once a week, if you don’t want to put in the effort to venture into the mountain with your guild then don’t complain that you don’t have the gear. Just play a different game where everyone’s automatically on an even playing field.
---
I think this is the key. Elite Ally guilds will be better than fine on pvp servers. They will get to dictate terms and can seek out and engage softer targets a lot easier than their counterparts once the Horde have driven Alliance out of the zones.
---
Fury/prot does not have particularly good opening burst threat or reactive threat gen, which is the two things you need in dungeons. It does give somewhat better (comparable till you're deeply buffed, really) threat on sustained single target fights, but man, fuck your sustained threat for running dungeons, nothing is gonna live that long anyway.
---
Cheaper Sunder, moar taunt and a stun is infinitely more valuable for opening scenarios. 90% of the time you spend in dungeons is spent in opening scenarios, and then stuff is dead.
---
Same thing with SS vs BT: one costs 20 rage, the other one 30. 20 is better for openers. 
---
And if you're Tacmas / prot you can charge to build rage and assert dominance. This is better than an extra 25% threat on the 10% of fights that last 30s+.
---
The real problem that tanks have is holding threat on multiple mobs, and Fury/prot does nothing to improve on that.
---
It's fun though. That's the main reason anyone would go for it.
---
Not everyone that's 60 wants the P2 yet. I have a 60 and 31 alt, but know people IRL that are nowhere close to me. Some people actually care about how other are going to be effected by the faster content.
---
Try get a tank and 1 dps to grind the drop in winter spring for an hour or so. It's in the guilds interest.
---
unironically is
---
My private server a couple of years ago had a good system that made it so you had to pay an exponential amount if you wanted to switch factions. So if horde was slightly larger you could pay for 2 dollars to swap to alliance but you'd have to pay like 25 to swap to horde from alliance.
---
google a wow classic horde leveling guide! there's tons and will prob be more valuable than the sub.
---
&gt; I am a pariah on this server because I speak my mind
---
People who say that or, "People don't like me because I'm honest" are usually complete pieces of shit with no tact who are full of themselves.
---
Let's say Blizzard released a new server that started on phase 6. How long would it take a poopsock guild to kill KT? 
---
What would be the biggest hurdle for them to get though with limited gear, 4 horsemen?
---
Wah.
---
Well the holy spec is so overkill atm that it's the best option anyways.
---
i noticed this as well, very weird i can't think of any other items that have decimal stats on it
---
As I said, it has what I need in part...  
---
It completely lacks in charm, class diversity, mechanics etc etc etc. You're not really interested in discussing any of that though, as far as I can tell.
---
Meanwhile Grobbulus has a near perfect 50/50 split and a very healthy community...
---
Ahh yeah the classic "I don't have anything else to say so I'm just going to say you're a liar"
---
Good talk man.
---
What we gain in flight time we lose in corpse runs to the horde zerg that seems to permanently reside in BRM.
---
10v1 or more as is horde tradition.
---
Just want to add for people who don’t know, 1.1 was the release version of the game
---
Sadly, yes, I have accepted this.
---
I was gonna go with millennial.
---
Yeah the whole sentiment seems to come from players who say “Well I don’t want to do x but I want equal gear to those who do x or it’s not fair”. Not sure why Blizzard caves to these players.
---
&gt;avoid using competent modern servers. 
---
No hardware changes are going to fix bad software.
---
Well thats good to hear, glad your server is doing good. Its just ironic and honestly quite funny how you said to stop bitching and just leave while thats exactly the problem thats being discussed in the post, of people leaving
---
Well aren't you edgy and stupid.
---
So many bad ideas in here.
---
They could divide the queues. Each faction restricted to half of the server cap. That would do wonders and they are pissing people on the megaservers off anyways.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI-S41EKXV0 
---
They legit stole the level up sound
---
dps warriors are the most competitive for raid loot.
---
But yeah at least they can get 5mans easy.
---
If Blizzard increases the capacity per layer they can fit more layers on a server without affecting the population cap. This is exactly how they got from 10 layers to 2 layers according to their october update:  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-layering-update/320767](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/realm-layering-update/320767) 
---
" players have leveled up and spread out around the world. This allowed us to accommodate more players per layer, which means fewer layers required per realm. "
---
so if they changed the layer capacity from 3k to 6k they could go from 4 layers on a 12k realm pop server to 2, without affecting the queue times.
---
Chest and shoulders are the same too
---
This is entirely wrong. You DoT rogues because the damage will break stealth.
---
No, because horde would only be allowed to transfer to an alliance heavy server in your scenario
---
I don't disagree but honestly if Blizzard doesn't make faction specific transfers.....I don't blame people for not wanting to get camped for hours. You can call them soft all you want but that shit isn't fun.
---
Even though a 60/40 split isn't that bad the 60 can easily dominate a server obviously because no matter what they will have the numbers.
---
This comes down to what exactly you consider "PvP" befor you tell people to play PvE servers n stop being a baby. I like fair PvP and I don't consider ganking lvl 48's at 60 fair PvP nor do I consider 6 people ganging up on 4 people fair PvP. So when you push people out do be surprised if they leave because you have a different definition of PvP.
---
So if I was in that 40 part of the split and my enjoyment of the game was being stripped away over something like getting camped at a FP you bet your ass I'm xfering or Quitting.
---
And Wrath which also includes that feature is somehow worse?
---
If the fury tanks that you’re talking about don’t have a shield/OH macro swap, they’re not good at DW fury tanking. If they do and just don’t do a good job at using it, they’re not good at DW fury tanking. There are very key, significant differences in GOOD DW fury tanks and piss-poor DW fury tanks.
---
There are good healers, there are bad healers. There are good rogues, there are bad rogues. Let’s not create a “lump sum” of an entire spec because you personally haven’t witnessed a good rendition of said spec.
---
I don't disagree, I think faction specific queues are a good idea. All I'm saying is that you can't make a point for current populations when they are expected to go back up very shortly.
---
Back in the day I would sometimes go to an j ternet cafe. And the owner was working on getting rank 14. He got rank 14. All he did was play the game and run wsg.

You had me trying to decipher some cryptic shit for like 10 minutes.   I re-read that post 3 or 4 times.  Looking for video links, checking upvotes, I almost went to their post history.   When I finally figured it out, I almost fell over, completely overwhelmed by my own stupidity.
---
my guild is all full of dad gamers with full time jobs and we have MC / Ony on 2 hour per week farm and most people are working on their alts in the lvl 30-50 range with nothing left to do on their mains but farm.
---
Yeah it used to be that you put in effort raiding to get stronger in the world and just in general. Then it became you put in effort raiding to get stronger only in raids.
---
Does it? 
---
If you only allow transfers to realms with balance issues doesn't that help fix it?
---
Horde overpopulated on Sever A, but underpopulated on Server B?  Allow horde only transfer from Server A to Server B. It will balance out populations on both servers, no?
---
Thats because we played on a PVP server when WOW was first released and I don't want to have to deal with ganking this time around.  *laughs in PVE*
---
Warriors are def in a worse spot in raids imo.  And I'd agree with mages too, good luck getting gear in raids as a mage when there's a shitload of people competing for it.
---
This just reads as a horde that doesn't want to lose him HK farm. You can't be serious.
---
"hey! The Alliance is running away from the server because it's not f7n for them, Blizzard make it so they have to put up with being farmed! Don't let them leave!"
---
Nope, that is incorrect. There is no "global" threat reset. The only threat reset throughout the fight is her fireballs (in P2 she targets the person with the highest threat, reducing it to zero - if multiple people are hit, the person with the lowest GUID has their threat reset).
---
It is correct that dots make it slightly more complicated though (competes with the tanks for threat, like damage always does), but whether it is before or after she lands doesn't matter (unless it's enough damage to make her fireball you while still in the air).
---
Have you been to start? Or is that primarily ally in the northern part?
---
What kind of response is this?
---
He isn't even arguing in favour of the current system, only pointing out a limitation on how it can be resolved and the only actual fix for this limitation.
---
So everybody on the dominant side on every server, alliance included. Nothing unique here. Too bad the other servers arent high enough pop to ditch on a free transfer.
---
Yup.
---
Not all sexism is necessarily bad.
---
I'm failing to find the latter half of what you quoted then responded to even being posted. Who the hell are you talking to???
---
Why not all of these things. Some servers run classic only, new ones go one with TbC and Wotlk and if done right Classic+could work. All at the same time and people can choose where to play . Having options is always better.
---
PVP racials is the biggest noobtrap for players. Alliance has Holy Paladins for PVP which are unstoppable in an organized team.

Arena run if someone has the key you basically run straight to the arena killing nothing so it's just the arena fight.  Consists of first wave non elites might be 10-20 if its the spiders or bugs.  10 or so if basilisks or bats.  After that just a single target boss nothing special about any of them, pretty simple.  If its aoe run with arena you'll clear a room full of non elite dogs with 1 or 2 elites with each pack but still no other bosses.  If you also push to angerforge(boss) after arena for hoj drop there are fire elementals that will hit you hard so always skull focus target those first.  Bunch of non elites with anger, at about 30% he calls for help and another pack of non elites with 2 elite medics run in.  Just pick the elites up, with decent dps the boss should die as they are coming in,  aoe takes out all the little guys very easy then just kill the 2 elite medics.  Arena/ anger run complete.  If they also want golem who is the room right after anger clear the whole room or he will aggro them when you pull, common tactic to line of sight them to the entrance you came in at using that pillar corner so they all group up and aoe can do their thing. On the boss kill the 2 big obsidian guys first, the boss will run out of the room looking for his helpers, don't follow him just watch for him to come back 5 to 10 seconds later so you can pick him up also so he doesn't wreck your healer.  Finish the obsidian guys, kill boss.  Complete.
---
I didn't say it was bad. I said I don't care one way or the other 😳
---
The main problem I see with that proposal is imagine a guild not able to raid because many of it's members can't log in due to faction que. Instead of raiding they will RAGE on the forums
---
I believe your proposal while flawed is viable
---
Yes!!!!!!
---
While I don't disagree with him about girls bringing a fuck ton of drama to guilds, you don't actually SAY that.
---
You just say, "we have an online application process.  Fill it out and we'll review it".
---
but we weren't on Stalagg...
---
You want all your characters to honor grind at the same time? 
---
I have no problem with boxing, it's handy and fun to have multiple accounts.
---
But doing pvp with multiple characters is horribly classless and you will never be honorable no matter how many kills you get.
---
I do because I feel it’s the only way to bring back the real feel of “experiencing wow for the first time” without having to actually replay classic all over - new areas - same gameplay - same leveling experience.
---
If only there were servers that weren't horde dominated. The solution isn't merging... We literally need more people to play alliance instead of horde.
---
it doesnt matter
---
I could be wrong but what I think that poster is saying is that it's an advantage being in an elite guild on the minority faction. All of your casuals are driven out of the zones and mostly off the server by the other side so you get to dictate where fights happen by targeting *their* carebears. Being in the dominant faction without BGs will make it harder to rank up.
---
There's no rather about it, merging servers would require forced name changes, which would annoy a ton of players, regardless of if their community merges with another. Why does one person with a name have priority over the other with the same name? It's literally the only reason they haven't merged servers like that before.
---
Cmon bruh really? You can't be that dense can you be.
---
I believe it is the target with the lowest GUID (unique character ID, based on the time of character creation) that has their threat reduced, and not necessarily the one with the lowest threat.
---
In any case, have two tanks stack during P2 so that both are hit by every fireball. This way one tank remains super high on threat while the other tank has his threat reset repeatedly.
---
Yeah I started late, only 46. It's tough to get on the track of those with more time on their hands.
---
