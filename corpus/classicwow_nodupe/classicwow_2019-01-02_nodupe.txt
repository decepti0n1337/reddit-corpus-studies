Certainly not, presumably 39 other people checked off on his attendance.  If no one wanted a Ret Paladin then he shouldn't have been invited.  The only two people I see in this conversation is a person enjoying his game, and a person that is mentally unstable.
---
---
---
Usually I’d agree with this, however I’m not talking about social politics here I’m talking about a corporation who is making massive bank from game impacting micro transactions. 
---

---
Step back dip your rose tinted glasses and take a long hard look at blizzard and the rest of the gaming industry. When it comes to large gaming companies exploiting people willing to pay to win or those who are time poor, classic wow is ripe for the picking. The game takes time to get things done and with the community aspect back some players fun lives and dies by their reputation and they will do anything to succeed. 
---
There is a market for the wow token in classic, and any publicly listed company will slip down any slope to keep share holders happy. Especially when your stock has taken a 50% hit in 12 months. 
---
It’s a logical fallacy for a reason. 
---
Absolutely right. See you in voting hell for pointing this out, this sub has a hardon for "sticking it to the meta".
---
Not sure who you expect to "troll", you're simply not going to get invited to everything...
---
Exactly this. And the point is, if someone is not cool with it, that's okay. 
---
yikes 
---
Shit he has a point.
---
I'm talking more about recent news, not Blizzcon panel stuff. The whole point of the post is the only thing we have to criticize at the moment is Sharding and Looting because that's pretty much the only changes from Vanilla we've heard about at this point.  Yet there's been an influx of posts saying Classic will suck because of recent bad press from Blizzard. Those posts aren't about Classic and are pure speculation. Aside from that, you make it seem like thanks to people posting every hour about Sharding ("What if we never voiced our opinions about sharding") that Blizzard has backpedaled and changed their stance on the subject. Not saying we shouldn't criticize those 2 main topics from the panel, but you're insinuating that they've made a difference at this point. 
---
Nah, it would’ve caused massive political upheaval. isildur is king after all. Plus they were like 2nd or 3rd cousins, Elrond wouldn’t have been able to bring himself to kill him.
---
But that's pure speculation. We don't know how Classic will turn out. My point is that we should hold judgement on the game until we get more information about it as we get into beta and into launch, not saying that because HoTS  is dead and Diablo is ruined that Classic will be the same.
---
Basically the system you are proposing was AQ/Naxx. A mix of drops and “pieces” that could be used by a variety of classes to ensure there were no dead drops. Probably the best system possible.
---
Making the game worse by killing the boss a few seconds later than with an optimal toon in that slot?
---
It's funny how someone can ponder a question for days, weeks, even months and the answer was 4 seconds away the entire time.
---
Voicing concerns/ complaints is fine if it's based on facts. Asmongold and others played BfA beta and compiled their concerns in the hopes they would be fixed. We have little to no data on Classic at this time, so concerns based off speculation on how other franchises are atm isn't productive or helpful.
---
I have been RPing in WoW for a while now, yes. In WoW and just about any other MMO, the great thing is that you get to **interact** with the people around you blindly. Why limit yourself to ONE custom arc when you can't RP anywhere else? Guild RP is good, but if your only means of roleplaying out there is via a specific set of people, things are gonna start getting irritating.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Let's use the Scarlet Crusade example for this. Currently, in lore, the Scarlet Crusade has pretty much been wiped out by Death Knights. Let's say you want to RP them in BFA. You play pretend and set some timeline rules with your guild, and then what? You won't be able to interact with other guilds/players out in the world.
---
I don't care about loot trading, add it or keep it out, fine with me. So I don't really care for your arguments against loot trading either. 
---
The point is many of those against loot trading see themselves in the NOCHANGES-camp... while at the same time being against GMs handling loot accidents. That's just hipocrisy, because GMs DID handle loot accidents back in the day. So most of those against loot trading want at least one change (and yes that DOES affect gameplay, loot mechanics are part of the gameplay) while at the same time they're screaming NOCHANGES and I'm really getting tired of this. 
---
I wouldn't say I was suspicious all the time, but yeah, it was a good feeling to know you're in a group with decent people. If the communication is fun, and all participate you could be pretty confident there was no ninjas in the party even if you just met everyone.
---
Do you mean t3 gear or t3 set pieces? The set pieces don’t contribute at all to DPS. Naxx has a number of items that are extremely good for kitty DPS but quite a few of Druid’s bis gear aren’t from Naxx so you can be quite strong without ever making it that far.
---
I’ll stick with my final paragraph. If your account gets stolen I don’t care....
---
I’m not sure how you can compare a wow token to a random drop, you pay blizzard you get a token. Someone buys that token you get gold. Nothing random about that. 
---
You’re correct about the game not being fair, that’s how it should be. Why would anyone want to even things out by adding a wow token into the game, so people can risk free buy an advantage over those who can’t or don’t want it. 
---
I’d argue that more people in classic will want to buy tokens to sell for the exact same reason you say they won’t. Gold is scarce big guilds will sell carries for it, a minority will farm for it the rest will pay blizzard for it. 
---
And lastly you are correct about gold sellers. They will be there in classic as they are still there in retail. But they will get banned, the people who buy from them will be banned also and that is a good thing. 
---
On retail, rolling need made an item BOP only for BoE items. If a BoE drops anywhere and you roll need on it then it will bind to you. That is not the same for items dropped from bosses. That is how it functioned in retail when they introduced loot trading. You could trade the item to a party or raid member for 2 hrs after you acquired the item.
---
Equipping the item would bind it.
---
RELEASE YOUR RAGE!
---
Didn’t know Nixxiom was so gud at feral.
---
Right? If he was gearing and rolled need and the other players didn't need the item as well they would pass on the item to let him get it.
---
They've given us 10+ years of reasons to shit on them when it comes to WoW. And we'll keep doing so until they give us a reason not to. 
---
Yah it was. But that guild never killed rag. Never got to bwl. I felt bad but. I was never going to complete the TF with them anyways
---
At OP's point where you do less damage than the tank, you might as well just /dance around the boss. It also doesn't sound very fun to be doing less damage than a prot warrior
---
It’s so much fun that I never thought about switching my main even 12 years later. You do a lot of pocket healing in premades, but I would always slap on my feral gear against low rankers or pugs and murder them to make them feel bad.
---
People would try to run from me sometimes... You ever try to escape a Druid with feral charge, roots, war stomp, travel form, free action potions, and PvP trinkets? Lol good fucking luck.
---
I unstand why someone wouldn't want their potential rewards randomized.  I hated random stats on items more.  It has been years but I think they put two decimal places on items in Diablo 3.  Weapon rolls 74.65% dps out of a possible 70.00-100.00% DPS spread.  I'd rather know that I will eventually get something I wanted in my lifetime than this pile of unrealistic expectations.
---
Be useful or be a pirate, yarr.
---
&gt; When Blizzard still had control of the game, they nixed it, and for good reason: servers need to be self-sufficient and self-correcting.
---
Prove that third party black market gold farmers were “nixed” before the WoW Token.
---
Totally forgot AQ had the scarabs/idols, but yes that system.
---
Making the game worse by not doing their job as a DPS properly and not switching to a job that they can do properly (healer).
---
Expecting to get carried by others. I'd not yet call it being an asshole but it's definitely not a friendly or helpful way to approach group content. 
---
Yes we say no changes but at the end of the day blizzard has a narrative, to cut costs. It's been painfully obvious in BFA and blizzcon. So instead of just screaming no changes (counterproductive because blizzard already said there will be changes such as loot trading) we are proposing a change that will not have such a drastic change on loot mechanics. What's your issue with that again?
---
You can always 'have fun' playing a single-player game, where other people's time and enjoyment isn't at stake. Don't be surprised when other people opt for group members who care more about results which EVERYONE benefits from, who put up with boring builds and grinds to get them in order, than people who just barely pull more weight than an empty player slot because they're 'having fun'. Really, getting out-DPSed by a tank as DPS, is not only pathetic but entirely unacceptable.
---
I don't care about meme-spec players who perform well enough that their weaknesses are minimized, but the person in OP was clearly a shit player playing a shit spec, and then instead of apologizing for dragging their group down, doubled down. That'd be an instant kick and ignore from me. Those types of players never improve or learn why no one likes them because they're delusional to begin with, so you need to cut your losses and move on from interacting with them as soon as you can. Good thing OPs example won't happen Horde-side, at least.
---
It’s like when you’re at work, and that one person is outside smoking cigs all night while everyone else works. Did you get through the night? Well yeah. Was it awful? Well no. Does that make it right? Of course not. 
---
&gt; I tanked all 5 mans, UBRS and ZG many, many, MANY times back then.
---
Decade-old experiences are no evidence of future performance. We're not in 2004. Player expectations are no longer the same as those from 2004. Unless you believe otherwise?
---
&gt; And you are wrong, because not every people in Classic will think like you do in pservers.
---
The first time, sure. But after being burned by a Paladin tank, Balance Druid, or Elemental Shaman (outside PvP) they will quickly get over the free lovefest.
---
It's just my opinion, based on playing both pservers and retail but honestly? I think mine is the more realistic, less pie-in-the-sky utopian opinion.
---
&gt;Yes we say no changes
---
&gt;we are proposing a change
---
Hipocrisy, that's the issue. You can only pick one. 
---
The problem is that Blessing of Salvation makes everyone else feel bad. If you were a healer you'd be able to give them DPS boosts, not Threat nerfs.
---
Man, DPS players are going to whine at the thought of a Paladin tank. On pservers they already do.
---
So you agree that we should voice our opinions, but not all the time? Are you ok? This forum is bogged down with low-tier memes, the same questions that have been asked for the past 10 years, content creator's crap content, "what class should I pick" etc etc... This forum was created to share all things Classic WoW. They are implementing conveniences for themselves that a majority of the community hates. We don't want them. If YOU are getting tired of seeing them, maybe YOU should take a break from here.
---
Again, I think it really depends. Most of my practice comes from pservers where I mostly play Alliance. I tend to think of the 30-40 range in these intervals: 30-32, 33-36, 37-40
---
For 30-32 as Alliance you can choose between these options: 
---
-Hillsbrad/Arathi round 1 (I forget which quests, but there are a few, some of which chain into quests to be done later; I almost always choose this option; can be dangerous in terms of PvP)
---
-Shimmering Flats (awful on crowded PvP servers, potentially worse than STV because everyone is in the same general area, and some turtles are Orange if you’re 31 or lower; I sometimes skip this on Alliance)
---
-STV round 1 (First set of Kunzen quests, first set of Nesingwary quests, as well as a couple of the lower quests from Booty Bay, as you may have chain quests there; only reason not to come to STV is if it’s too crowded/camped to quest)
---
The only other zones I can think of for this bracket are Gnomeregan (great loot and 8 quests or so) and Eastern Ashenvale (not worth the travel time for Alliance). I may be forgetting some but I will try to be thorough.
---
33-36:
---
-Desolace (Highly recommend any Alliance who plans to run Scarlet Monastery a lot to choose Deso; great hub even if you are skipping dungeons, very widespread; travel time sucks, but I will always quest here on any character)
---
-Dustwallow Marsh (I put it in this bracket because I like to go to theramore around level 35; I consider Dustwallow 35-37; great option for Horde and Alliance!)
---
-Hillsbrad/Arathi round 2 (not too many quests, but 34ish is a great time to knock them out; again, very high chance for world PvP)
---
-STV round 2 (There are many quests in STV that are perfect for the 34-37 range; try to combine round 1 and round 2, and you have the potential for 32/33-35 in one trip!)
---
I can’t think of any other zones worth questing in at this level range.
---
37-40:
---
-Arathi Pirate quests (kinda shitty quests, only a few of them, terrible if other people are questing there; go around level 38/39 if at all)
---
-Badlands (recommended; involves a few Alliance chain quests; head there in the 37-39 range
---
-STV round 3 (best to save this for some time in the 39-42 range imo; basically finish everything you can in the zone at this point; there’s some stuff that is ok there in the 41-43 range, and that range is pretty sparse for quests.
---
-Swamp of Sorrows (not many Ally quests there, but the trip isn’t bad, and it’s pretty decent xp in the 37-39 range.
---
I can’t think of anymore zones off the top of my head.
---
My personal leveling route is:
---
Gnomer &gt; Arathi/Hillsbrad round 1 &gt; STV1+2 &gt; Desolace &gt; Dustwallow (hearth to Menethil and boat; do not walk from Deso) &gt; Badlands OR Swamp &gt; STV 3
---
&gt; You WILL be more dead than alive as a lvl 30 trying to kill lvl 30 panthers/tigers/x
---
Even on crazy popular pservers with 60s camping Nesingwary, this has never been true of my personal experience. This is an exaggeration imo
---
I mean... ret dude is an idiot, but why message him bitching about it?  Just add him to the block list and move on.
---
You can choose to read 1 or 2 lines out of any response and declare hypocrisy. Obviously you're incompetent to understanding a narrative and figuring out the best possible action to achieve that narrative. Stick to your close minded thought process
---
But ret pallies bring buffs, can keep up judgement of wisdom to help raid dps, give their party resistance buffs, and can bring utility to a lot of encounters as an aoe offtank. Lackluster dps is not the only contribution they bring to a raid.
---
Don't have a video on it but it's the most basic thing you can do in video editing (apart from trimming the video)
---
All you need is a video editing software that can use more then one video layer (Sony Vegas pro or adobe premier pro. Both of these are the more common ones, there are others out there aswell)
---
Get that software and then look up how "key frames" work for said software. Don't need to go in depth in it, just the most basic knowledge is needed to pull this of.
---
Oh, and photoshop could be good to use if you need to edit the picture so it matches what you are attempting. 
---
This is gonna work great until everyone on the server knows not to invite you cause you're a bad player and a shitty person. 
---
The title asked if meme specs could be made more fun, and the reply was that they're fun the way they are and this is why.  Not sure what you're on about.
---
Loot trading as a "solution" to sending GM tickets shows you the level of game design (or rather a lack of) currently at Blizzard. This is mostly reflected in the retail WoW.
---
You can literally prevent accidental loot distribution by e.g. slightly changing a UI, move the f away "need" and "greed" buttons away, add confirmation dialog before loot finally moves to someone's bag (trivial to check whether the class can use the item; color the button/text green if its plate for plate wearer, yellow if mail for plate wearer or red if you try to give plate to cloth wearer). 
---
I agree, they don't invest as much in GM as they used to and want to keep those investments minimal for classic as well. I mean look at this retail game screen when you try to send a GM ticket:
---
https://i.imgur.com/idOeyPi.png
---
Can you imagine if you use say Adobe CS suite (with monthly fee), and when you try to get help, you get a screen "Oh well just check StackOverflow!"... jesus.
---
Because people didn’t really start saying it til a couple months ago, despite the buyout happening a decade ago.  The signaling is just funny
---
I'm ready. There's going to be people who out-right quit because they put hours and hours of work in but their prot paladin isn't being invited to tank raids.
---
I would highly recommend checking out his guild's logs and seeing where he places among them before rolling a feral exclusively because of these clips. Also consider the effort to get where he is. If you still want to, go for it.

this is why enhance shaman gets relegated to using nightfall (and isn’t even an optimal nightfall proccer) and ret just doesn’t exist. feral druid requires a lot of effort and farming for specific things to be somewhat competitive.
---
it’s not that these specs do marginally less dps than classes like warr/rogue/mage; they literally do anywhere from 30-60% of their dps. it’s a MAJOR hindrance.
---
Perhaps a useful piñata?

Genius
---
**Pygocentrus piraya**
---
The fish Pygocentrus piraya, often called the piraya piranha or San Francisco piranha, and sometimes sold as the man-eating piranha, is a large, aggressive piranha from the São Francisco River basin in Brazil. It is one of the largest piranhas, reaching a maximum length of 50 cm in the wild, and is sometimes considered the most beautiful, with its orange to yellow belly coloration, silver eyes, and rayed fibrous adipose fin. Like most other piranhas, P. piraya is laterally compressed and roughly circular in profile, and bears a mouthful of very sharp teeth. The lower jaw is thick, strong, and protruding.

---
Came back to retail, no idea why they got rid of the post-exalted 999 rep.
---
Just changes for changes sake.
---
how are you going to troll tryhards as a meme spec when you’re never going to get into a group of tryhards because you’re a meme spec? try using your brain next time.
---
You'll get invited to a raid. They'll let you stay for the first boss, and then you'll be kicked and locked to that raid ID.  
---
You'll end up trolling yourself.  
---
Nah, it's really just a binary choice. 
---
You either say no changes (NO changes - that means zero changes) or you don't. You want at least one change. One is not zero. You're not for "no changes". It's really simple. 
---
No need to insult me for pointing out the hipocrisy. I didn't make the rules of math, but one does just not equal zero. 
---
Anyone who leads a raid in Classic and accidentally invites a meme spec without realizing it. Just let them stay for the first boss and then replace them. You'll be doing other raids a favor for that week.  
---
&gt; utility to a lot of encounters as an aoe offtank.
---
Who the hell is funneling tanking gear to a Paladin in this guild?
---
The Warrior will AoE offtank because they actually have the gear to.
---
I played mostly male Trolls from Vanilla to WoD... the new Troll models seem very bouncy indeed... kinda alienated me from my favorite race...
---
For the majority this is true. But there's not really an issue with "meme" specs if they go deep with grinding full pre bis and full consumes, including dark / demonic runes, shadow oil, blasted lands buffs etc. I did it as an enhance and was consistently top 10 on fights that weren't melee unfriendly. Ret has better gear options in aq40 and naxx and can push upwards to 800 dps which is more than enough to clear even the hardest content. Unfortunately it's simply not worth the time investment to do consumable / gear grind for most meme spec players and so they give those specs an especially harsh reputation in pve. I'd gladly take a deep af ret for extra blessings or enhance for imp wf totem and to allow and free up a resto sham to remain in a caster group for caster totems, notably tranquil air for warlocks or fire mages. 
---
so much judgement and hatred over a video game in these comments. sad to see you suffering. 
---
They start to feel better once they realize they can aoe / cleave the pulls alot easier. But hey can still have a paladin healer and have twice the buffs. It's not like dps will only go with a group if they have a paladin healer instead of a priest just cause the priest doesn't buff dmg like the paladin does.
---
Totally agree. Unfortunately most guilds from vanilla always seemed to have this shadow cabal of officers that had their favorites. Vanilla was also pretty brutal when it came to gear drops. 40 people having to split a few measly epics usually left quite a few people feeling salty, add in the feeling that other people are a priority before you makes the whole thing feel like a waste of time. 
---
Unfortunately, tanking as holy spec (with the correct gear) is probably better than healing raids as prot spec.
---
But I'm still going to do it any way.
---
Cos game looks like a shitshow with loot trading, automated reports, no progresive itemization, compressed content which make game stale for monthes. sharding at launch looks the most harmless in this line, though it sucks badly aswell ofc.
---
Its not to kill hype, thats just what i think, and very confidently not just assumtions of speculations. I wont even play it mostlikely, i have enough grasp on vanilla wow and how it works to get how the game gonna be with all these things in place. (not to mention legion client engine and how it will affect all the micro moment of the game).
---
The problem is a ton of ppl here havent played vanilla for years on ps, so they dont fully have a grasp and dont fully understand all the applications of these things and how it gonna affect the game.
---
So they probably still think  these changes are bad, but think its kinda ok and not that big of a deal, they dont grasp how really bad it is and to what extent and how the game gonna be with all these things. op included.
---
I mean, obviously don't wish harm on anyone, but you should be doing more DPS than the tank. I wouldn't want to carry you either.
---
They've already confirmed no 32 bit client.
---
Blizzard thinks most current wow players who “give it a shot” won’t make it past 20 
---
Yeah, you're spot on. Why not just ask to bid on ret dps items, but in return you heal with some hybrid spec while wearing healing gear. 
---
Hunter tourists won't make it to 10.  6 to 10 without a pet is hell.
---
Haha epics memes friend you really showed them with your EPIC TROLLS xD
---
Ret Paladins offer utility and are quite fine Noghtfall wielders though
---
The “holy trinity” paradigm of Tank/Heal/DD really made the MMO genre stale and it’s playerbase obsessed with numbers
---
I fucking lost it
---
tfw you're a felucca and you don't have a foremast
---
Its funny because the people who buy gold are the same people who will get bored after a week playing classic. Something something journey vs destination...
---
I’m sorry but DPS is almost entirely irrelevant to the completion of basically any 5 man dungeon in the game... “making it harder” for other people is nonsense...
---
If you can’t clear 5man Vanilla content, it isn’t because one of your dps is Ret...
---
It reminded me of my TBC days, when I was dueling as a ret outside Orgri gates. Every third player running by usually messaged me like "learn2heal, noob", or "kill yourself", or just did /laugh and /spit. I didn't demand anything, I never raided or cleared a dungeon as a ret (I was mostly prot then), but they were still trying to humiliate me.
---
Your last statement starting with how blizzard handles it really hits the nail on the head. There are many ways to handles this and everyone seems to agree its all about the "how" really. I myself think about it a lot and can see how stressful it can be for the people running the show. This is where i see the #nochanges mindset come into play, becuase its the more predictable environment for everyone leaning towards more positive than negative. Player base and Devs alike. Changes could be good yes but then comes the concern for the future.
---
 Say they shard starting zones at first. What will happen when everyone is no longer in shards? There will be a large percentage of players around the same area due to unhindered questing. Sure it'll be less than launch for sure, but will it be enough? Okay lets shard it up again in redridge, will that be enough of a separation? What about when an Un'goro Devilsaur mafia war outbreaks, the AQ40 opening ceremony, opposite faction city raids, Tarren Mill vs. Southshore esc. stuff? Will they have to shard these very populated events that can/will occur and break the immersion of an MMO? At the end of the day i personally think sharding is just a band aid fix of an idea for vanilla that should not be implemented as much of an innovating and cool thing it is for the modern day game.
---
I mean during t3 content how does feral stand against other dps. I’ve never raided with a feral
---
The group is probably a better judge of that. If they didn’t kick him...
---
Your definition of dead weight seems pretty exaggerative in this context...
---
Because op IS the ret idiot 
---
People like you will ruin this game
---
I never got called out for being ret ever and raided up to ZG, but that was a simpler time so who knows how it'll be.
---
This. Do people not remember raid lockouts a being a thing? Getting kicked early on was a waste of an entire weeks reset.
---
If running with a Ret Paladin makes the game worse for you, you are the reason WoW has been dead for several expansions
---
+1 to this. Level 20 is the real inflection point. It's when you realise that, yes, levelling up is getting harder and harder and corpse walks are never getting any shorter. 
---
Are people downvoting you because they disagree, but have nothing to contribute about why they disagree? I can’t figure out Reddit. All you did was express your opinion
---
There are 6 paladin buffs though. Not every guild will have that many holy Paladins.
---
No one is suggesting you give tank gear to the ret over the MT, or even the 4th OT.
---
Now think about if everyone went meme spec. The raid would never get done. Why do some people have to continue but others don't?
---
People like you will save Classic
---
Back then we generally used forum and a special Ventrilo channel for cross-faction communication.
---
Level 20 before they quit to go wah on the forums and write a big list of changes they demand be put in the game 
---
 Ow think about if everyone went healer. Zod, what a contentless argument. 
---
IMO I’d prefer to start dosing sooner than having to sit with my thumb up my ass waiting to start
---
Which memespec are you rolling in Classic?  
---
Downvoted for speaking truth...
---
Yeah, private server players are the polar opposite of patient...
---
10 years ago, people usually didn’t leave dungeon runs until after many wipes; private servers, you’re lucky to have nobody leave after 1 wipe
---
As I posted above, I will be playing farming Frost Mage and Cookie Cutter PvE Warrior... maybe a Hunter alt as well...
---
Cute presumption though
---
I don't know how much clearer I can make it.
---
If I ask "how can I make my pile of rocks bigger" I am not inviting you to tell me about how the pile already seems big enough, to a certain kind of person who deliberately goes out of their way to make life difficult for themselves so they can feel like a special snowflake.
---
OP wanted to know if there were viable changes to make failed PvE specs worth using in endgame PvE. They didn't ask for someone to waffle on about how they enjoy noodling about with failed specs despite the fact that aren't worth using in endgame PvE.
---
Classic
---
They don't bring any utility a holy paladin wouldn't bring, and they are not good night fall wielders. 
---
No you're cute  
---
I never said anything about opinions. I've said in the post to keep the complaints to things directly associated with Classic. Not speculation on how things will turn out based off other games or the state of Blizzard in general. The problem is that we don't know much about Classic at all. The only information we have is what was shared at Blizzcon. Criticizing sharding or looting changes is FINE. My personal opinion is that we've already beaten the sharding and looting horse enough to get the point across, but that's it. Once beta comes out and then launch, there will probably be plenty of things to criticize, but until then, hold off on posts like "Classic is dead because Blizzard killed HoTS and Diablo" or "Classic will fail because Blizzard is evil".
---
Damn that's pretty on point and very cool. What would you say for kitties and rets though?
---
Warrior wielding nightfall is kind of a waste imo; hunters usually have more pressing matters to attend to than keeping up a debuff in melee; who else is a viable Nightfall wielder in Alliance?
---
Do raids actually bring enough Paladin healers to cover all pally buffs? If not, I fail to see how the Ret isn’t the most valuable Nightfall wielder...
---
I've been playing blizzard games since before they were blizzard :)
---
I think to 20 should be pretty fun for most people considering it's going to be super busy/populated (yes, even with sharding). The grind sets in a bit in the 30s, especially for classes without a 'travel speed' ability. 40 is definitely a nice boost with the mount, but the last 10 levels are a real slog. Quests are few and far between and spread out across the world. I think a fair few people will quit once they hit 60 as well once they realise there's almost no way to get gear or progress at 60 apart from group content, especially before pvp gear is released (and a lot of people just don't like pvp).
---
It's a bit annoying but really only a few hours at most and you have the idea of getting a pet at 10 and becoming the easiest levelling class  pulling you on. I doubt many will quit before 10 that bothered to download the 5gig client in the first place.
---
I had a really good (and massive) 21" CRT for the first year or two of Vanilla and switched to that exact Dell 4:3 monitor afterwards. So this hits extremely close to home. 
---
When they realize how crazy world PvP is gonna be on a fresh vanilla server in the first contested zones. STVietnam will be where a lot decide they either can’t stand it or they can’t get enough!
---
Video games are more dynamic than ever now, they are not binary in nature. There are things that were in vanilla that are removed in classic, take wall jumping for an example. I guess I need state that I don't classify myself in being the #nochanges group that you're referring to because it's ludacris to think that it's a good idea to deliver vanilla with crucial flaws and bugs that weren't fixed until TBC and onward. Why would anyone want someone to be able to wall jump outside of warsong with the flag? 
---
But if blizzard is saying that certain changes need to be implemented in order to reduce tickets and increasing gm availability (aka cutting costs), why would you try to argue no changes when clearly it is not going to happen? You can say it's hypocritical to propose a different approach and change challenging the original but there is no other choice for us at this point. It is literally pointless to try argue no changes because inevitably there will be. Now it is our job to ensure that the changes put in place do not drastically disrupt the vanilla experience. We should be able to honestly say that after playing classic that it feels like authentic and faithful recreation to vanilla wow as blizzard stated they would deliver. Otherwise it defeats the entire purpose and reason for classic wow to exist.
---
Some points you brought up about druids are incorrect, ferals held Aggro much easier than wars, but they had basically no survival cds, which is why wars are still the best.
---
Otherwise some items are interesting
---
They suck as rogues? But mah bonus stealth MS!
---
It came with the patch that added paragon rep boxes so it probably had something to do with that.
---
What is actually reads it referring to
---
The prot warrior that isn't currently tanking uses nightfall. Your rogues don't need wisdom, your tanks don't need salvation, your mages don't need might, your warlocks don't need sanctuary, etc. 
---
Ignorant here in classic wow, but wasn't ret sometime asked to cleanse and heal in order to let healers keep some mana?
---
Ragnarok Online my dude... the older version of that game has a special place in my cold, black heart.
---
We should either make a pinned post about things that the community would like addressed (sharding, loot share, etc) or just leave it alone. I want blizzard to listen to us too but literally the top post in this sub daily has to do with it. Have a pinned thread where we can voice our concerns so it doesn't consume the rest of the page and it gives blizzard an easy way to track our concerns. Literally a win-win.
---
&gt;having this drop off a boss was the equivalent of getting socks for Christmas.
---
I love the warn fuzzy socks I got for Christmas this year! 
---
I figure there'll be two main groups.
---
The first won't make it out of the 1-10 zones.  They'll die repeatedly from overpulling or wandering mobs, or get upset about having to actually find a group for group quests, and give up right away.
---
The second will make it into the 20s and will start to realize just what the word "grind" means.  They might make it into the 30s, but eventually the levels will slow down too much and they'll make the decision that any meaningful rewards are going to be too much of a time and energy investment and cut their losses.
---
Nah, that’s just a knee jerk emotional reaction. I don’t really have a position here. Just calling it like I see it. 
---
Blocked as well. 
---
Westfall will drop a good bit of ppl. STV is the real test. 
---
After STV in vanilla, I remember grinding two entire levels farming mobs on an island in Feralas just to be left alone. Not even gonna start on BRM.....
---
Isn't the only prediction that came true here the fact that the Nost team split?
---
&gt; The port warrior that isn’t currently tanking uses Nightfall
---
That leaves gaps in Nightfall uptime in the event of tank swaps, and don’t Warriors scale better with better weapons than Paladins do? In other words, wouldn’t it be better for a warrior to have a better weapon equipped when not tanking?
---
Also, I’m not just talking Blessings (even though if someone is missing a Blessing they benefit from, there should be another Paladin in the raid for sure), but Auras as well. 
---
If healing is totally covered and you’re missing a pally buff, do you cut a Resto Druid/Holy Priest to bring in a Holy Paladin and a High DPS, or do you bring a Ret to Nightfall?
---
The difference is with alliance, attacking Nathanos would set off the PvP alarm, and since he is the only  thing that can do so in the zone, Horde WOULD FLOCK to his aid.
---
Alliance groups had probably less than 3 minuts to killing him before getting totally overrun by horde looking for pvp.
---
As a result, MOST alliance never attempt this quest because its just not worth starting a war in EPL over.  Once horde got the alarm, the zone became a un-playable BG gank fest to level in if the population was even split or horde favored.
---
At least, that's generally how it worked in pvp servers.
---
yep
---
Except it was not accepted in Vanilla at all. I was a Ret Paladin in Vanilla, I would only raid as DPS after we had said raid on farm, and on progression raids I would heal. Almost no guild ever took Paladins to raids as anything but healers. It's not going to be any different than it was. 
---
    &gt;corecraft
---
It's more like you have someone at work that has some sort of disability and cannot produce as much output as the rest of the workers, despite putting in equal effort.
---
In ZG, Ret is more viable due to smaller party size and how strong Paladin buffs are. Also lots of stunnable mobs by HoJ.
---
They need to introduce seasons.  Every 2 years launch a F R E S H server or progress to other xpacs.
---
no
---
The blood elf paladin quest for their epic mount involved, rather than purifying a death knight's horse like the alliance paladins do, burning down the chapel in strathholme and massacring a bunch of paladins basically out of spite and to prove the supremacy of the blood knights. The blood elf version of paladins is much more elitist, opportunist, and self-driven. It's actually more realistic, in a weird way, but far apart from the idealized fantasy of lawful-good pure-of-heart crusaders that the alliance have.
---
Great thank you! I got some shitty meme videos to make.
---
[removed]
---
I didn't read past "pile of rocks" but I hope you got that out of your system.
---
A new guy started at work last month, and he didn’t know what Alt-Tab meant/was. I work in tech support, and this dude has a relatively technical background. I really thought he was fucking with me but nope. 
---
 Are prot pallys used at all in raids?
---
How so? 
---
That it’s greed only. All I have heard from blizzard is loot trading will be in the game. No rules of how it’s going to work. If you have info on if its greed only then please provide a source. I’d like to read that.
---
It’s how loot trading works mate. 
---
IMO 20-25 is the real noob check. You have to grind a lot of extra mobs as questing is pretty scarce and widely spread - at least for horde. No easy zones where you can walk into at 21 and leave at 24.
---
Not out dpsing the tank is just the player playing bad.
---
Well, short answer, yes. Long answer, between the racials you will have, your opponents will have and the fact that two classes are faction locked, it's a big deal. Racials mean a lot more in classic just keep that in mind.
---
Playing with music enabled this time through.  It's my only regret.
---
Agreed, I think those who get their first mounts will probably stick around to get the better one later on.
---
Kitties are fine, but they could use better itemization. Paladins are boring as fuck so I don't know or care. 
---
A friend of mine had that. We had regular LAN parties where i stocked up on movies and pirated games for the month.
---
I'm not in the image
---
&gt; IMO I’d prefer to start dosing sooner than having to sit with my thumb up my ass waiting to start
---
You'd be surprised, at least on pservers, how much people are willing to wait an extra hour for a Warrior / Druid, than wipe for three hours because someone they don't know/trust wants to level a memespec.
---
If only people would realize this
---
Good question you have there! Not sure if it will really matter down the line but the Primal bat gloves will only become available with the ZG patch, so much later than you might be getting the Devilsaur set.
---
Removed rule 7. Easily google-able. 
---
Good times. I remember I was always stoked to see bbb ip addresses on my DC++ connection list because they were high speed, probably because bbb gave people symmetric lines. Over here we had a lot of 2/1, 8/1 etc so we enjoyed bbb over here too :p
---
And you know 100% it will still be that way in classic?
---
No at all. 
---
Exactly. Progression raiding is about putting in the work so you can have fun with the gear later. If we got something on farm and you want to go Ret for fun, I wouldn't care but I'd be pissed if I was min/maxing and someone else in my raid wasn't.
---
What faction have the better racials? What races have the best racials?
---
No. It's absurd to assume that you're only able to PvP efficiently with one of the factions. Each race has pros and cons, and some racials are better than others, though at the end of the day your skill is going to matter significantly more. 
---
The only time faction is a big contributing factor is if there is a large imbalance in populations. 
---
Wotlk is when the hybrid tax stopped existing. Before then, it still sucked ass to play some specs since you were still a buff bot. Like nobody took moonkins or feral dps seriously in tbc either.
---
More people enjoying a healing spec would be a huge boon for the game. Healers and tanks are the bottlenecks. Also, healers actually contribute.
---
This seems to me like one of those tactics where the extreme side of something is shown as a blanket statement for the masses. 
---
1. Ret is arguably on the lower end of the "memespecs" in general 
---
2. This player was doing something wrong, very wrong.
---
There are actually a lot of "memespecs" that come launch people will be very surprised to see their numbers. This is not 2004 anymore, a lot of people have discovered some interesting things and still do to this day about the original game on how to optimize dps and utility in ways people couldn't think of then.
---
&gt; No one is suggesting you give tank gear to the ret over the MT, or even the 4th OT.
---
Then why did the guy I responded to say that one of the things a Ret Paladin brings to a raid is AoE off-tanking?
---
Ain't no Ret offtanking without the necessary gear. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! Did anyone actually play during Vanilla?
---
Who ever took the screenshot is the ret, I'm only assuming its you.
---
I'd say the grind starts to slow down right around level 20, when you really realize "fuck, this is going to be awhile". So I think most users who make it to 25 are breaching that "breaking point". 
---
The dungeon was completed (presumably without anything to do with DPS numbers), and Paladins provide innate utility which is more valuable in 5 mans than 40 mans, because in 5 mans, unless you’re running a few Paladins, you probably don’t have all pally buffs running
---
Coming within the week will be LFG posts for this sort of thing. Removing for now. 
---
Osrs has been our for 6years. All content has to be voted on by the community and has to pass with a 75% yes. So no they can’t kill the game unless the players vote yes for it.
---
Did you mean to spell pariah?
---
Personally, I’ve been playing a mage and have been playing mining/skinning and have found that skinning is more profitable simply due to the abundance of mobs you’re able to skin. Ores certainly aren’t a rarity by any means but they’re far less available than mobs you’re able to skin. It’s nice to have lots of money, however if you’re really passionate about PvP and are playing a warlock (which gets a free mount at level 40 anyway) is just go mining / engineering 
---
You bring in a holy paladin and have either a prot warrior or hunter use nightfall.
---
A ret is literally half a player when compared to something like a mage or warrior, they're simply not worth having in your raid unless you have fewer than 40 people available and you just need warm bodies. 
---
Sometimes sacrifices have to be made
---
Hafsteinn for MVP. If you're going to get ret then carry your own weight, everyone else has to regardless of their spec. Choosing a bad spec means you have to try HARDER not propagate the retlol meme.
---
Juicy comment section
---
What rules should be enforced? Were there rules on RP servers in real vanilla? Not saying it should be the same, I just really had no experience on those servers back then.
---
The pserver community isn’t the best example though imo; in my experience, most pserver players are pretty skilled at the game, but severely lack patience and do not care about the long term consequences of things like leaving dungeon groups after a wipe, flaming others (as evidenced by this screenshot in OP), outright refusing to help with quests party members may need in a dungeon because they don’t need it themselves and it would take an extra 15 minutes, etc.
---
This isn’t the experience I had back in the day and I sincerely hope this isn’t the kind of people I will play with in Classic.
---
Also fwiw, I don’t think Paladin is a “memetank” until endgame, and even then I feel that is a harsh description
---
Quel'Serrar had a very interesting questline and I believe was a very good tanking weapon. More equivalent to Benediction in terms of tier.
---
&gt;This is not 2004 anymore, a lot of people have discovered some interesting things and still do to this day about the original game on how to optimize dps and utility in ways people couldn't think of then
---
Not true, if you check websites with pserver logs on raids, you'll see meme specs always at the bottom.
---
I think there will be more waves, one around 20lvl, second one around 40lvl and yes I think some tourists will get to 60lvl do few dungeons and quit. 
---
Stranglethorn Vale
---
Oof. I am hoping after the email today I get it sometime this week or next. If it's already here I can only assume someone took it...
---
Yeap, it's a ret who got mad over a holy pal complaining about him being a dead weight.
---
Just gotta make up for with with off heals, BoPs and Salvs.
---
Then where is the typo
---
Sounds like class quests had major narrative differences, even if they were functionally the same. This is helpful, thank you! I assume that Draenei shaman quests were also pretty different from Horde ones then.
---
I don’t think you understood my last question.
---
Assume your raid doesn’t need more healers, but is missing a pally buff. Why is Holy more valuable than Ret in this situation, when more healing is unnecessary?
---
Should you kick a non-Paladin healer, recruit a new Paladin healer AND a Mage/Warrior/Rogue or should you recruit 1 Ret Paladin to be the Nightfall and buff bitch?
---
A 13 minute video that should be about 3 minutes. 
---
Depends on what you want to play?
---
If you think Ret palas are terrible go watch one of Esfands raid videos. Now if you do less dmg than a tank you're either specced horribly, geared horribly or playing horribly.
---
I never said they were going to be at the top did I? All i said is there are some cases people would be surprised. I've seen feral go toe to toe with some "OP" specs until Naxx, yes they have to work like 10 times as hard as everyone else to achieve (farming gnomer and such) and theres probably a million reasons to just throw another mage in instead but they can do it. 
---
Well, esfand is the perfect example that ret is garbage, he got all the gear, buffs, minmaxing everything and still did shit tier dps.
---
Why don’t warlocks need BoSanc? 
---
The fact you have to explain to supposed vanilla fans that buying gold is bad is so unironically worrying. 
---
Locs are cheating!
---
Quel was very much like benediction.
---
Usually replaced by a good weapon in BWL
---
If you really don't want to play Horde, don't.
---
Altough their racials are for some classes better than the Alliance counterpart it will most of the time not come down to just said racial match up.
---
  
---
I would suggest you go Alliance if you don't want to play Horde and should not feel forced to play Horde just for PvP.
---
One time my neighbors moved out and left their garage door open. My best friend and I stumbled a box of old magazines. I'm now 36 and still think of that as one of the best days of my life.
---
It might be a contributing factor though. What happens when your group doesn’t quite have the gear to down that final boss... well that and the retadin is doing less dps than the tank? If they had any dps that could pull its weight that boss would die. 
---
A game we spend a lot of time and effort in. We don’t like it when we do all that work just to have to carry someone else.
---
Ret sucks, but man do I love the autistic screeching that it causes
---
Timeworn Mace was good as was Quel Serrar which both came from Dire Maul. Quel Serrar had a cool time line where you had to go kill Onyxia and stab it in her. I actually could never acquire Quelserrar and used the sword from ZG the bloodlords defender. Also, there was a rare blue weapon that was really cool as well called Fiery Retributer that the OT in my guild used back in the day.
---
Playing during vanilla doesn't earn you any validity. The game changed more during vanilla than during any other expansion. Also, if one played mage during vanilla how the hell are they expected to know anything about paladins and especially ret/prot paladins?
---
As for your argument, a holy paladin can AoE tank most stuff in raids. Only place where I'd take a dedicated prot paladin is possibly Fankriss because the worms hit super hard and if one of the worm OTs can't get aggro fast enough they will cut an ungeared paladin tank to pieces immediately. 
---
We try and always bring one retri paladin to raids. He'll swing his Nightfall and do some dps while increasing the dps of the mages and warlocks by 15%. Assuming about 10 such classes in the raid you get an extra half a player's worth in raid dps, in addition to his own which is about half a decent dpser depending on the boss. Nightfall duty can also be thrown on the offtank but we prefer them just equipping their fury gear and go with that. 
---
The biggest problem with the ret imo is that it's very boring to play and doesn't go high on the meters, which means players lose interest in them and stop showing up to raids. So usually we have someone who PvPs a lot go ret in raids. It's always contentious to give a powerful item to a ret or a boomkin though. 
---
I also have to wonder if it's not an alt or PUG run seeing as he is so far up the meter considering his gear progression every other DPS should be blowing him out of the water.
---
As a warlock you will have some more gold to spare come lvl 40 as your mount is free. However I would still go with Skinning and mining in your case early on.
---
Most of the engineering goodies that are usefull for warlocks come later on (imho) so it might be worth it to profit from that skinning cash whilst lvling and just switching over at lvl 60 when you have all them matz anyway.
---
You don't need more than 4 blessings per person in a raid - might/wisdom, kings, salv/sanct, light. Even light is a bonus but not required on anyone but tanks. Literally the only person in an alliance raid that would benefit from a 5th blessing (might + wisdom) is the ret paladin himself.
---
What exactly is token level prices?
---
People keep talking about tokens increasing cost of other items, but how are people gonna get the gold to buy a token in classic? How much are they gonna sell for? Cause I doubt anyone is buying any token in classic for 1k in the first bit of a server.
---
As a rogue main I do love that crit buff though. I’m for bringing at least one feral lol. The feral in my guild runs in to decurse on shazzrah. He gives out innervate and of course has rebirth. He occasionally off tanks those few times we need it. He more than earns his spot. That’s what a non meta spec player must do to be welcome in raids.
---
I think this thread has changed to progression raiding and not raid farming like the post seems to imply.
---
That was a joke on autocorrect dude
---
I did a lot of healing with the reckoning bomb spec which was mostly prot. I needed a lot of potions but not that bad. Never tried the hardest content like Naxx or AQ40 with it though.
---
While I kind of agree. What I found insane  was that when I came back to WoW right before BFA (left during Wotlk) that I leveled several characters to in their 30’s and 40’s and literally nothing felt meaningful. Most kits main rotation was filled out by level 20-25, no gear felt any more meaningful than the last, it was all just a linear stat climb. 
---
So in that sense, getting blues in early dungeons provide a significant impact, or it at least felt that way. Same with class quests such as whirlwind axe etc etc... I foresee people that are looking for meaningful rewards will remain around because they will be willing to grind for those. 
---
World PvP more comes down to a faction populations.  If you want to always log in and have players to fight then play against the faction that has more players.
---
To answer your other concern, Horde does have better overall racials.
---
Not to my knowledge. Warriors have it covered. Even druids tank more than paladins in my experience.
---
Some classes like mage and hunter get benefits from rank 10 gear. Druids really dont :( other than looks haha
---
Having an ongoing war between the Alliance and Horde that takes place on scheduled events over pre-determined objectives like capturing and holding a specific building in a zone (like Thunder Axe Fortress' Command hall in Desolace) eventually resulting in a victory for one faction may be awesome.
---
We're talking about the instant gratification crowd from retail wow. 
---
How are you going to camp a million people lol
---
I'm sure the Chinese fans also care about themselves too. Nothing wrong with supporting the Chinese market - they make up a huge chunk of the WoW playerbase.
---
Those players are probably assholes to everyone and not just you. 
---
He’ll join a group of failhards and then eventually they’ll have to decide which ones need to respec to take down raid targets 
---
Except this guy seems to have done it on purpose leading me to think the smoking example fits more.
---
I'd suggest getting engineering from level 5 on.  You're going to need those stun grenades for PvP encounters.
---
I don’t even recognize my guildys/friends by their faces in WoW. When I try to find my GM I just look for a Tauren in plate or PM him. 
---
The AH mount. Other than that yeah it’s basically useless unless you don’t have it.
---
Agreed. Playing a meme spec is one thing. Not doing more dps than the tank? That’s unforgivable. 
---
Feel free to keep downvoting me. I’m just asking questions. The fact is no one knows how it will work in classic. They specifically mentioned master looter. My hope is it will be confined to raids.
---
Honestly no, I never recognized people by their characters appearance. Everyone had same face except for the Forsaken and Female Dwarves who purposefully looked ugly or tried to look cute. 
---
Every Fem Troll took the cute face and Mullet. I don’t even remember m Orc Hunter friends character, I just remember it’s name.
---
Corporate greed at the cost of content is always a reason to shit imo 
---
Exactly what I was going to say... well without the forum crying anyways. 
---
I mean there are servers that aren’t pvp.
---
&gt; I don’t think Paladin is a “memetank” until endgame
---
I guess it's a semantic issue. My definition of a memespec is one which is not viable in under expected circumstances. 
---
For example, overleveling / overgearing a dungeon is a tanking mechanic for Paladins. Having your teammates not do their full DPS is also a tanking mechanic. 
---
Even our talents are a meme: *Anticipation* raises your Defense. Good for tanks, right?
---
Except in Classic Defense raises your Dodge + Parry, two stats that are anti-synergistic for Paladins. Paladin hold threat by dealing Holy damage via Redoubt + Sanctuary + Holy Shield + Righteous Fury.
---
*Not* getting hit actually makes you a worse tank.
---
You have to admit that's a meme.
---
Wouldn’t the community then immediately start publicly shaming them?
---
I know I’d call them out in Orgrimmar.
---
Yep and a few hours to go from 6-10 will blow their minds.
---
Horde Ret absolutely shits on Alliance Ret, its not even funny. 
---
Seal of Blood is your blood elf racial ability, this is great because Judgement of Blood refers to your melee hit chance when used, unlike Judgement of Command which refers to spell hit rating. 
---
The second great thing about this is the fact the SoB slightly damages you meaning you can take advantage of Spiritual Attunement, a new mechanic introduced in TBC to increase the viability of protection paladin. Basically whenever you get healed you receive 10% of that healing as mana back. This is enough to sustain a horde ret fully, allowing them to pot haste whereas an alliance paladin will have to pot mana on a decently progress fight. This also allows the horde ret more liberal use of consecration for AoE.
---
The Haste point is important since haste% is an outright better scaling stat for horde as seen [here.](https://i.imgur.com/yzRyyP0.jpg) Issue is noticed again when you have a somewhat organised group with 100% drum uptime.
---
The next great discrepancy can be found withing seal twisting, judging(off-gcd) + swapping to SoB immediately as a melee swing hits and still benefiting form the SoC proc.
---
Decided to give a private server a try last month. I love it.
---
He did top 5 dps vs Magmadar with pre raid BiS, meaning he didn't have any epic gear at that time. That's far from terrible. I mean i guess if you wanna compare to warriors or rogues on private servers yes, ret will not beat them no matter what. They can simply output more dps no matter what you do on ret. On classic however we still don't know how over or undertuned the classes are with the actual true data in the game. Some say warriors are incredibly overtuned on private servers and that they don't remember warriors being that strong in vanilla. Anyway we'll just have to wait and see. We can only speculate. All im saying though is that you can definitely make ret work a in raid if the ret knows what the fuck he is doing.
---
Lol if they think corpse runs at 15-20 are bad wait till they die to king mosh and realize the only gy in ungoro is on the other side of the zone.
---
Since you are a warlock, and you get a free mount I would recommend Engineering and skip skinning. 
---
Skinning isn’t going to make or break your income, and really doesn’t provide much money until heavy leather and above. (At the point where Engineering can benefit you) Then once you factor in the time it takes to skin each mob, I’d say you are better off skipping the extra pocket change.
---
I bet he's a keyboard-turner too.
---
I never saw shaman specific gear until the tbc pre patch. We killed ony and got 2 shaman helms. We weren’t happy. It happened to everyone if I recall.
---
I would imagine most srart dropping off around level 30
---
Besides passion projects people run from their basement thats basically every major game company
---
Only retard would think like or think I'm thinking like that.
---
10 minute spawn timer on a pet that shouldn’t be the way he is with the talent tree the hunters have. It’s authentic as fuck though guys.
---
Guess what - people WILL buy gold in classic, but it will be from unauthorized goldsellers, and not from wow tokens. You are naive if you think tokens are the cause of the problem
---
People are allowed ro have a different opinion than you
---
The person in the screenshot clearly expected to be carried. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was afk half the time.  I don’t mind meme specs, my guild takes a ret to zg and to mc. He brings consumables, has pally power, big wigs, etc, and comes ready to raid. 
---
Use: Don't eat me.
---
This is just cherry picking the best type of fights where when done properly they excel but do to the short duration of the fights other classes can't ramp yet.
---
I don't need to explain to you why buying gold is a big no. If I do then there's no point in continuing this conversation is there? Blizzard selling gold is not the answer and never will be. Certainly not for classic WoW.
---
I was on an RP server in vanilla and it was only done in shadowy corners because it could tarnish your rep. RP was basically a cardinal sin. Rp servers have a lot of benefits that pvp servers don’t.
---
&gt;thinking blizz implemented tokens to combat bitters and gold sellers.
---
They brought out tokens to combat massive amounts of players quitting during wod, people with large surpluses of gold ended up buying 1-2 years worth of sub with their in game gold.
---
It had nothing to do with gold sellers, everything to do with making $$$.
---
I had friends that were still on dialup when i graduated in 07 because they didnt live in town and its all they could get at the time (or satellite, which was super expensive and useless for gaming because of the lag)
---
tl-dr: Basically an RP Friendly "Faction War" which takes place in certain zones, kind of like TF2 Control points except it's zones.
---
Just play horde.  Then you don't have to worry about ret pallies.
---
yeah i mean realistically its like 2-3 days /played to 40 so i am sure people who are used to going from level cap one xpac to level cap inanother in 10 hours wont know what hit them
---
I would say until around 40, thats really where grinding whole levels on mobs starts getting common, and i don't see new players having close to enough gold to buy a mount at 40 which will result in an even slower leveling time around that level bracket
---
Also par for the course for Ret. Not enough mana and abilities to maintain good damage.
---
In vanilla I talked SM all the way to Mara. They changed rockbiter I believe and by the end of vanilla it was basically not viable or possible to tank any longer as shaman. Paladin tanks are vable I believe but I played horde so not really sure there.
---
This is why I love PvP. 
---
you misunderstand what im saying. I mean you cant sell your retail token for gold in classic because if you buy it from the AH you *must* use it, im not saying anything against what you are. Just adding that the person you were responding to is proposing something that just cant be done, even in retail now. If a token if bought in retail with gold it *cant* be relisted, it *must* be used and converted to 15 dollars bnet cash.
---
Mid 30's for sure. That's when the grind officially turns into a slog.
---
What about Hyjal content? Zone was done. Might as well use it if classic is a success. Maybe a raid beyond Naxx in that zone.
---
All vanilla was , it’s nothing compared to warmode. You can’t move without getting into fights in certain areas and using a flightmaster is suicide. I don’t think that is what tourist will see as breaking point 
---
Was on dialup for all of WoW vanilla.
---
Ah yes.
---
Yeah, powershifting MCP farming ferals can put out some massive damage. It's difficult to do, but it can be done.
---
Ret just does not have the toolbox to compete. You can funnel the best minmaxed gear to them and they'll still be subpar.
---
Isn’t the mage pve vanilla rotation filled out the moment you create your char ?
---
That doesn’t make much sense to me. Tokens don’t generate gold, they if anything, take gold out of the economy.
---
You can see that currently on retail.
---
When there was abundant gold the tokens were 250k+ BfA with its million gold sinks yanked it to 100-112k.
---
The pirate ship mount made it spike for like 4 hours then drop due to the lower amount of gold being generated and transferred around in the economy. 
---
Also people could do that in Vanilla already, it just wasn’t allowed/supported. Tokens were made just to be a legit way to do that shit and make blizzard money.
---
Damn it must be nice to have a 3month vacation regardless
---
Critic is okay. But most people here are just insulting. 
---
Well it’s also to make a legit way. People are less likely to buy gold and boosts when there is a legit way to do it.
---
&gt;Edit: Just went back and watched esfands video on magmadar and he had BiS BWL gear on lmao and still didnt rly go high dps. You might be right.
---
Yeap, take a look at his raids: https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/Raids/?page=0&amp;charid=307186
---
Even with his guild funneling gear to him, he's always doing the same dps as the tank and sometimes even less.
---
Do they not have a ground floor/initial value like the WoW token?
---
I'm sure of it, but they used my spec as a justification to be as offending as possible.
---
I've had a shaman tank LBRS fully for me and do relatively well. I'm certain a paladin would have no trouble inside Scholomance and Stratholme. That's not to say that shaman can't tank those UD dungeons but I know paladins will have an advantage. But it basically ends at raids. Unless you find a guild willing to funnel gear to a chosen shaman then I don't forsee a shaman or paladin tanking.
---
I came here to poast this.
---
Thottbot 
---
Classic doesn't need to be "saved".
---
&gt; Hope you enjoy! 
---
Nah. I shut that shit off at 10 seconds when the garbage clipping shitmusic started blaring.
---
Yeah, but we're comparing classic with retail. You run retail Scarlet Monastery few times faster than in Classic version. You simply can agro sick portions of trash, do insane amount of damage and guess what? Your healer don't even know about existence of food in this game. Cmon, your party would die only if tank and healer are suffering a stroke at the same time. 
---
That’s a good point, a lot of ppl just insult with no actual critique.
---
I thought he did it on purpose
---
Same
---
For sure, I’m just saying they are assholes in general. Imo, it helps you weed out shitty players on your server. Not that you deserve that kind of treatment.
---
I’m not talking about inflation at all. My problem is with blizzard fostering a pay to win atmosphere with wow tokens in classic. They are not as impactful in retail because the game is designed around it where as in classic it is not. You can buy BIS items with gold that stay BIS until Nax..... which is pay to win and pay to win is bad.
---
Where as before blizzard would ban you if caught, there was a stigma involved in buying it which kept the rates lower than if it’s a legit way to get gold
---
Iv posted multiple times about this and people keep talking about inflation, I am well aware that wow tokens dont cause gold inflation. 
---
Yeh maybe at ur kindergarden 
---
Yep pretty much this. I've realized it's not worth asking them of this. Their only hope of any new decent content will be with retail unfortunately (that is if it they take lessons from classic)
---
A selfish mindset will find the system frustrating.  However the RNG is not an issue if you consider how your guild is advancing as a whole.  This was especially rewarding in vanilla as your guild had a reputation on the server and the presence of having your raid-geared guild mates was something to be proud of.
---
Legendary weapons are a big example.  Obtaining one for your guild is a huge status symbol that elevates all the members of your guild in the eyes of players on your server.  Not to mention the fun of using one to wreck house in a BG.
---
Ok and no mater what that’s going to be the case. People will trade gold for gold allowing people to buy BIS which will be expensive and unable to be acquired for a long time.
---
What about after the first week? I can see them having successful launches because everyone wants to play them... I’m more interested in continued success after launch.
---
The caveat to this is that it's much more difficult to gear a spec you are not raiding with
---
You die spongebob or live long enough to become squidward.
---
I literally never saw a a single shaman tank for the entirety of vanilla and I don't understand why people think it was or is a thing.
---
This is me. Might not even play classic. I like tanking but holy shit I leveled a warrior to level 39 back in the day and rerolled into a paladin and was never happier. Not instantly dying when a runner draws another mob to you was the greatest thing in the world. 
---
do you think osrs is imune to the grave like all other jagex project
---
I was using my good old 30 something inch CRT until 2012, it took my house burning down to finally get me to upgrade lol. God damn thing must have weighed a hundred pounds. I remember HATING widescreen at first now I can't imagine not having it. 
---
I don’t think it’s ever been a lock. It’s usually Hunter or Druid 
---
If you're going for sabers don't forget about the winterspring saber.
---
+hit is absolutely the heaviest weighted stat til cap. For pretty much any class. Doesn’t matter how hard your attacks hit if they aren’t hitting.
---
He’s still never been beaten 
---
Something you'll quickly learn on this subreddit is that there is a large, vocal contingent of people here who have never played classic WOW.  They are convinced it's some hardcore promised land (WOW was always a fun, casual themepark from the very start) where every spec was viable, every player accepted, and yet was only for hardcore players somehow.    
---
You dont deserve to play a meme spec if you suck mate.
---
I hear ya.  My heavy ass CRT left a noticeable bend in my wooden desk.  I finally replaced it when I realized even at full brightness, it was super dark.   It lasted me 12 years though.    I used to hate widescreen too.    Most DVDs I have from the 00’s are fullscreen.  I avoided widescreen if possible.   Now I’m like “fullscreen?  Bleh!”
---
I'm pretty sure pre-nerf C'thun was proven to be impossible to defeat even with BiS for every raid member. 
---
So much this 
---
I want it just like it was, first imposssiiibuule then nerf :) 
---
It’s wow classic which is enriched.
---
&gt; He'll swing his Nightfall and do some dps while increasing the dps of the mages and warlocks by 15%. 
---
Or you can just have your OTs or a fury swing and not have a waste of a raid spot in your raids. 
---
I leveled as enhance from 1-80 when wotlk came out and the rewards for perseverance were huge. It was so rewarding when I finally got dual wield at lvl 40(I think). The payoffs are huge and meaningful in older versions of wow and are one of the great things about it.
---
I loved STV. Sure lots of time was wasted ganking and getting ganked but by the time I got out of that zone I had turned from a keyboard turning nub to a decent pvper that understood my class really well.
---
Curious to see how people woth this days knowledge would fair against it. I dare say the "math" that proved it impossible might be proven wrong.
---
That’s my line of thinking, why even bother hanging around for classic wow if you don’t trust blizzard to release the game they want? 
---
No,it isn’t. Not at all.
---
Isn't it viable to have a Ret pally with Nightfall ?
---
The AH prices would drop if anything. Tokens remove gold from the economy due to AH tax. 
---
I want the game recreated as vanilla,  not ques and logistical issues. That’s an idiotic stance to have.
---
You are right, OP. All the BFA refugees are filling in, fueled by their feelings of betrayal of Blizzard having completely butchered BFA while ignoring it was the B team that is responsible for that mess, and a completely different team is working on Classic which is a project that has a completely different design philosophy than BFA.
---
They are just emotional and it is getting annoying. A lot of them are right that we should be loud about some of the issues that have been risen around sharding and loot but it is becoming a bit much.
---
I would rather give the Classic team the benefit of the doubt instead of seeing the flaming day in and day out. The worst that can happen is that we get to Beta and there are still some issues and then some actually make it to live and so people dont play. 
---
We aren't obligated to play at all yet these people freak out despite the fact that the team actually in charge of Classic has said nothing but the right things regarding their design philosophy behind Classic and what they want it to be.
---
No. They suck at every single aspect of tanking because of their huge issues that are rooted in their talents and mechanics. 
---
* One of their mitigation procs is only up after you get crit. You don’t want to get crit as a tank.
---
* Prots have no threat and no taunt. If they lose aggro, they have absolutely no way of getting it back outside of some BOp gimmick that isn’t going to work half the time. 
---
* Huge itemization issues. They need spell power to have threat generation, defense/stam to be tankier and int/mp5 to not be oom 30s in the fight. It’s impossible to itemize for all that. 
---
* Their only niche is aoe tanking, and there’s no fights or trash packs that are worth bringing a prot pally to. 
---
You'll be happier if TBC/Wrath Classics are launched.
---
Buff pre-nerf. Go hard or go home! ^^^/s
---
"the Crowd Pummeler 9-60 is located in the first big room, if you come from the back entrance that requires the workshop key to go through the doors. If you are faceing the elevator that would take you to the bottom level of that room, then look left and after 2-3 mob pack he will be the next one.".   
---
I guess a pretty fast farm if you have workshop key
---
Not to mention I was using 1600x1200 res on crts since like 1999.
---
It was a pug (Onyxia iirc when this was originally posted on a pserver sub). Nobody gave a shit if there was a meme spec. 
---
People did give a shit when they realized that the meme spec was underperforming to the point that they were outdpsed by the tank. 
---
It was an ony pug, not a dungeon. 
---
I raided with my Ret Pali towards the end of Van. No one cared, my DPS was pretty bad but not the worst. We cleared everything fine, mostly because we all knew the fights.
---
It's a game, people need to remember that.
---
Watched this so many times.  The vid that got me into raiding 
---
Twelve year old me was rollerblading in 1995 and passed a roadside recycling bin stuffed with a decade's worth of Penthouses. Hiding them all was tricky.
---
&gt; lol @ the phone text: "Tarren Mill 20 ally log in!"
---
AND it would have been $0.10 per text. Few bucks to the whole raid.
---
IDK if there's any exact numbers given for the pre-nerf state of c'thun. It was said to be impossible but it would be cool to see how that compares of 13 years of optimization. Kinda hard to discuss with literally no numbers to go on tho.
---
metacrawler baby. search the search engines!
---
Just to note, MMO subscription numbers aren't published as a general rule. If they are published they will be significantly after the fact or a part of marketing. WoW has no need to market their size relative to the overall MMO market because it's the seventh expansion and no one else has even four these days. Except EverQuest, but that's another can of worms.
---
I think I see what you’re doing. When you run out of energy, you’re shifting back to normal form and then immediately going back to cat. Using the form shifting talent, you’re getting a certain amount of energy to work with instantly, but you’re also timing it so you get a tick of energy right when you switch. Is all of that correct?
---
Engineering is an incredibly expensive venture that's going to be a drain on your gold with very little of the profession giving back. However you've got a couple of options - You can go Mining/Engy if you're fine with some of the extra time needed to get to 60 if your plan is to skill up professions on the road to 60.  
---
Personally I would go Tailoring with Enchanting/Herbalism/Skinning because if your goal is PVP then some of the best gear comes from PVE content and your Bloodvine Set Bonus from 300 Tailoring is huge for every raiding Warlock in Patch 1.7.   
---
At this point in the game (Realistically Patch 1.4 / Patch 1.5) you should be geared enough that as a Warlock - you can start farming Mara / DM East by yourself for gold income and drop Enchanting/Herbalism/Skinning for Engineering - use a 1-300 guide and buy the reagents from the AH or use an Alt.   
---
tldr my opinion: focus on getting to 60, a solid source of gold income and then Engy 300 once you've figured out a way thats going to support or pay for it. Think about how important it is for you to have engineering now or later and the pros/cons of which ever route you choose.   
---
I spent a few years with Tailoring/Engy and Alchemy/Engy on previous Warlocks and it's incredibly min-max and fun but very expensive. I personally used alts to support my Engineering hobby. Best of luck!
---
Yes they did 
---
Yes and with the furor talent and wolf helm you get instant 60, include the tick and that's 80. Without wolf helm, buffs, potions or pummeler I was pulling 330ish dps on a 60 dummy with 9% hit ~60ish blue gear. I understand it's not a boss but pretty decent DPS to consider early on
---
And how does the retail team at all effect the Classic team? Please learn how development teams work.
---
This would be cool but sounds extraordinarily complicated, and you would need to organize and recruit people heavily beforehand who specifically want this to happen on that realm. Good luck though. And let us know when/if it’s happening
---
There is absolutely no evidence to suggest blizzard will use sharding outside of starting zones. Anything said to the contrary is just paranoid doomsaying.
---
1. World pvp
---
2. World pvp
---
3. World pvp
---
Literally everything else is a means to that end. 
---
No it won’t. 
---
Yup, more or less this. Would require a ton of coordination between guilds and players to set up, but the outcome seems like it would be pretty neat. Plus if you have that much coordination going on then other neat stuff could be done too.
---
God no, I don’t want MORE Cash Shop crap.
---
illegal server people are so toxic.  yikes.
---
It’s fucking boring 
---
You doing less dps than the tank is horrible even for a ref paladin. 
---
based on the other thread, about when they get told they should be shot in the head?
---
I thought Ret was really strong in TBC? :o
---
Before 2.4.0 patch, the captured Naaru, M'uru, was being held as a prisoner in a room beneath Blood Knights headquaters. Young paladins were given a quest to drain his Light. Even when M'uru was taken away by Kael'thas, there was enough "light residue" to power new Blood Knights abilities.
---
As far as I remember, the difference between Alliance and Horde paladins was mostly in appearance (except for two different seals, as it was mentioned before). The alliance charger was gold and blue, the horde one was red and golden. Also Blood Knights received a unique tabard.
---
That’s pretty crazy considering the stigma against ferals. What’s the general playstyle and rotation like? Itemization? I was going to roll druid anyways, but this makes it looks even more appealing.
---
Honestly I hope they just make other classes more viable. I like the main game, Azeroth being the only game world, ect. No one likes being pigeon holed into only playing one role. These days its alright as we understand it from the start, but it sucked leveling a class to 60. Spending hundreds of hours of hours on a character to get locked out basically the entire rest of the game unless you slot perfectly into a per-defined play style.
---
The current bland class homogenization we have now is cancer. But there is a middle ground. 
---
Of course. Just it's allowed to point out that they're wrong.
---
What a meaningless thing to say.
---
Can't tell you enough how very wrong you are. Private servers are made up of guilds, many of which are guilded with the same people as in retail. If what you're saying is there will be more casuals on classic than on PS, than probably yes.  Point is, in mc, assuming all the major classes are covered, maybe one ret pally can join, but that's almost only to scoop shit gear nobody else wants.  Also "up to zg" is this you saying that you raided until zg came out? Or out of all the raids in vanilla you have only done zg? Because mc is much harder, even aq20 gets harder. There are no prior raids to zg, there was ud strat and Ubers, if that's what you mean?
---
Hybrid specs honestly aren't bad:  but the design philosophy at Blizzard shifted over the course of Vanilla to make them so at higher levels of play.  If more encounters were created that required flexibility instead of rigidity, then hybrids would be less a meme and more a necessity to adapt to changing conditions.  Unfortunately, as Vanilla went on, encounters both in raids and later dungeons/ events became more tightly scripted, massively rewarding specialized roles.
---
Early in the game: leveling and even in some of the "old school" dungeons, hybrids are fun and super useful especially when the players aren't 100% knowledgable about the content.
---
Lmao imagine being passionate about your hobbies.. crazy. Also I don’t see any “hate”
---
Also I feel you missed the mark on titanforging a bit as well. Not only does your gear have to rng drop in retail, but you also need to pray that it upgrades as well. Now there are two factors regarding your piece of gear and a possibility that you won’t be content, even if your shit drops. On vanilla there’s only one bloodfang hood, and if it drops, it drops.
---
I’ve been here long enough to know now that this simple question will get ME downvoted, but why are you getting downvoted? Was it a joke that fell flat? No one ever seems to be willing to explain why they downvote. They just do it, sometimes seemingly indiscriminately 
---
Ill be honest, this entire thread makes me want to get off this hype train. Memespec or not, this toxicity is what I tried to get away from in WoW.
---
I guess you'd have to see how hard you hit on average between each attack power, and see if the difference is worth about 100 hits.
---
Yeah, we all know. You're literally preaching to the people who need to hear this the least in this sub.
---
Durotar and Elwyn Forest both have some really nasty ones. Most people have forgotten how bad the original ones were because in some patch the added many more gy's in all the vanilla zones.

Sorry to break it to you, but you live in fantasy land utopia, where the only thing needed to stop gold buying is to say to people - "buying gold is bad". 
---
Unfortunately I live in real world, which doesn't work like that. Now you can say to me in 1000 different ways how buying gold is bad, but I already know this, and people will still do it
---
I still don’t think they are as bad as ungoro. 
---
I wasn’t aware people whom never played Vanilla even had the interest? For years I’ve heard anyone whom didn’t experience Vanilla disparage Private realms, and go on about how I was just cheap for not wanting to pay a subscription anymore. Even though I simply fell out of love with the game. But I have always though the retail players, (most of which prob never played Vanilla), were happy with retail and saw Vanilla as “old hat”. 
---
I’m genuinely surprised to hear that people whom weren’t around back then are actually invested in Classic. It just always seemed to me like they love the quality of life features so much in retail, they’ve been happy to have nothing to do with our “basic” Vanilla
---
Originally on RP realms non-RP names (like coolrogueganksta) were reportable and they'd be forced to change their name. Eventually as communities disappeared across WoW the rule stopped being enforced.
---
I can't wait 
---
You intro with tigers fury once before start of fight, 2 shreds then shift then 2 shreds then shift. Ferocious bite when Max combos. Thats pretty much it besides pummeler and consumables. Shred and fbite are only things worth the energy
---
You realize the number of players who are on this subreddit will be the minority. A lot of players will be new to vanilla. A lot won’t have played it in years. There will be plenty of people who don’t min max. There are people on pservers who never played WoW before. They got on them because their friends/family were playing. I know a gm who fits that description perfectly. The guild foes not enforce min maxing. Most of them dont even know what bis is. It won’t be as prevalent as people think it will. You will know who the elite guilds who enforce it are. They will be ahead of the pack and clearing content before anyone else. Join them or don’t. It’s up to the individual to decide how they want to play.
---
I wouldn't mind a lock at a 20% difference. So the max you could have would be 60-40.
---
It can be but what I remember is you're bringing them for fully improved blessing of might and some comic relief.
---
There's a difference between accepting your role as off spec and falling of the DPS if you can significantly compensate elsewhere. Im pretty sure it was group not raid wide crit but consider adding 5 crit to the top 4 highest melee DPS, since you don't specifically go for crit over other stats, it winds up usually adding 5% damage, or close to that, among there top 4 highest melee you're responsible for adding 20% of their collective DPS, totally worth it.   That is, until you want rogue leather haha.
---
u dont deserve my response
---
I’d say there more than likely will be sharding in the starting zones.that however isn’t a real problem as long as it’s only in the starting zones and blizzard has done nothing to make me think otherwise.
---
Okay, thanks anyway for responding. Hope your New Years was good!
---
Nope. It was a "meme spec". Before 2.3 ret was completely broken, after it received a few buffs, but the spec still carried a stigma on it. I knew 2 lucky paladins who raided as rets, but they were treated as a exception.
---
Ret became strong in WotLK.
---
If classes aren't tuned about what they were years ago people won't last the week playing.  A lot of specs hopefully will be...subpar...that's my hope.
---
A good ret pally would still out-dps the tank. Quit being bad
---
K
---
They're two different games with two different teams. You hit this spot on, sounds like he's upset about BfA or some other unrelated game to Classic.
---
What’s four months of your life for a mount..
---
Prot is good for pulling all of ZF for your lv 38 friend, in a raid, you can get one shot by any boss.
---
offtank can spam hamstring to get 2x as much uptime as a paladin can achieve. 
---
yeh ask ur mum
---
The fact Blizzard is struggling to recreate a game that was done in 2004, is seriously making me laugh.
---
The fact we’re even discussing sharding is comical. 
---
Ugh. I hope not. Good luck.
---
You had forty people.  You could bring a person or two as weird specs and find some utility that allows them to contribute.  Pally judgements, Off heals, cleansing and buffs were useful for a raid.
---
Ahaha, good luck on your exams 
---
Any paladin can do that, so if you're in mc and you have 5 paladins, the most useless one or two are cleansers. Same goes for other debuffs.
---
all you *need* to heal as a pally is 20 point in holy (so crit heals refund mana) and healing gear. Deep holy will be like 10% more efficient, sure, but that's not game-breaking if you understand how to heal in vanilla (i.e. when to spam, which spells, downranking, all of which is pretty trivial for pallies)
---
I got plenty of tells back in the day walking around iron forge as a pally with a big two hander on my back.  Lots of people asking if this was a joke or if I played as ret.  
---
He probably is though.
---
From what I saw from one of my buddies in a 15/15 alliance guild's logs, it was usually middle of the pack but managed to get in top 5/10 on some fights and was topping the charts on KT.
---
Don't even bother comparing that with horde though, the difference between benefitting from every pally buff vs a measly str totem is night and day.
---
This thread has better pvp than current retail wow.
---
Mana pots and Dark/Demonic Runes both on cooldown and pots/runes don't share cooldowns. Let's not even mention Judgement of Wisdom (it will probably never happen).
---
Yeah I wouldn't play Classic of any version if they messed with class tuning.
---
Because you... In all your game design knowledge, could replicate a game as old as that, with total ease... When your entire customer base demands the complete authentic experience.
---
Comments like this make me howl with laughter. Either you are stupid, or totally clueless. Both are as bad as each other imo.
---
Enjoy Ignorance.
---
Really? How come? 
---
Less people will opt into buying it from gold farmers, it’s not 100% but it’s better than dumping tokens into a game not designed for it. 
---
Gotta hit those YouTube metrics 
---
To me there is no better feeling than looting beast twice. Once for the drops/meat and another for the skins. And I love chillaxing and grinding mobs.
---
Then I see a node during my killing and I get to mine it. And because its vanilla, I get several hits off a single node and it feels good.
---
&gt;Because you... In all your game design knowledge, could replicate a game as old as that
---
Oh what's that. This random redditor can't make a multi-million dollar video game by himself? Well I guess that invalidates his argument!
---
Just stop giving them money? And if you have, go outside and get off reddit?
---
I feel like since they changed nothing to accommodate tokens that’s a non argument. 
---
&gt;Ret palas should be shot in the head
---
well he's not wrong, that's just always been true
---
I keep waiting to hear lfg sneak in....
---
I haven't given them any money in ten years buddy. 
---
Oh yeah that makes sense! Thank you 
---
As noted, Warriors had Quel Serrar as their "big epic", but warriors also had a number of general weapons that, when you saw them, you said, holy shit that's bad ass. Seeing a warrior with Sulfuron, Hand of Ragnaros and seeing that legendary text colour was like a religious experience the first time you saw it.
---
There were also weapons like Obsidian Edged Blade, Askhandi, Drake Talon Cleaver, and one of my all time favorites, the Chromatically Tempered Sword, that showed that you meant serious business.
---
Makes me a bit jealous to be quite honest!
---
No but your argument is just "This makes me laugh because they can't do this" 
---
Garuntee you couldn't replicate a scene from your life in 2004 totally exact. Due to the fact that memory fades, and the fact the things to create that scene doesn't exist anymore. 
---
There are tons of factors that are an issue for this project. The same way restoring a classic car is harder these days, despite the fact that the technology has gone way beyond that what it was. 
---
If you can’t trust blizzard this isn’t the game or the sub for you.
---
One of the best quest in the game.  So lucky I stumbled upon a forers compendium early in tbc and managed to finish it 
---
Yeah, Vendorstrike and the Lion Horn of Stormwind are bad, but the rest of the items aren't bad at all, quite the opposite.
---
They are actually one of the best parts of classic wow, there were many different and strange niche items. The trinket from Ragnaros for example, is great for the reason stated in the video.
---
Kind of disappointed in the video since there are many "bad" items in vanilla (items that try to fill a certain roll and fail miserably (like Vendorstrike).
---
Most items listed here are just items that aren't optimal for raiding, but they do what they are designed to do fairly well.
---
Shields were also important.  Skullflame being an obvious favorite.
---
On the one hand once the game got real popular, most potential RP names were probably taken which would lead to issues and seems like a likely explanation for the rule to be relaxed.  
---
On the other hand, maybe that won't be as big a problem in Classic.
---
Imagine unironically typing this out. 
---
Imagine unironically typing out the OP.
---
Equally this OP is just crying that they should be able to cry about something because other stuff has gone wrong and therefore this will go wrong now, so I will Pre-Moan about issues that haven't arisen yet. In a game that's not out yet. 
---
Rather than being like... Holy shit the community asked for Classic and here is a company hearing that we want this thing, and have invested a huge amount of money in it.
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Well if poor old Activision-Blizzard is having too much trouble maybe they can hire the creators of a private server they shut down. 
---
Talking about people who never played vanilla and only know cata and beyond....they won't make it their first talent point without giving up for awhile.  The game will be too different.
---
They met with them. But I'm sure you have all the notes of their conversations in your infinite wisdom. 
---
You’re talking to a pessimistic arrogant idiot. Don’t expect to make any headway with him.
---
^ Do not do this. This subreddit is not a place for criticism and even thinking critical thoughts may have to warrant a ban. 
---
Bullshit. We have to fight for Classic. And right now it’s not looking good at all.
---
Yeah dude I was actually the intern taking them. I guess that means I win.
---
There's a certain cachet to the idea that you're "more hardcore" than everyone else.  While playing a vanilla wow ret paladin.
---
It’s looking fantastic so far.
---
Oh believe me, I'm aware that snowflakes like this  can't be reasoned with. However the flow of stupidity entertains me.
---
Imagine praising a company for investing money with the purposes of making profit. So noble! So kind! They truly care about their fans!
---
Me too mate, me too.
---
I like how in your manifesto here you didnt name one qualm you actually have with Blizzard. How about you let us in on what they have done to offend you recently? Or better yet, how any other team and their decisions is somehow on the shoulders of the hard working Classic team that, as far as we can tell as as far as they have indicated, is trying their hardest to give an authentic vanilla experience with no evidence to suggest otherwise?

Congratulations. You are now the stupidest of our generation. Some people physically can't be happy.

Enjoy participation medals and your mediocre life.

/thread 
---
As in, those of us whom experience Vanilla think we’re “more hardcore” or “true veterans” over those who played from TBC onwards? Or that those whom are “daring” enough to go something like Retribution in a progression raid are “more hardcore”?
---
Sorry if I’m not understanding your response, haha, it’s late, and I should be getting to bed. But thanks for responding.
---
A manifesto? Pretty sure it's gotta be a little longer than 150 words to be a manifesto. 
---
The leaps you manage to make from post to post are actually fantastic, especially given that you seem to believe they amount to some sort of logical "gotcha" in each case. You'd make an excellent troll, even though you are completely serious. That's a compliment.
---
It's quite hard to master this sort of ready illogic. You have a talent. 
---
&gt;mate
---
Oh no...that explains it. 
---
I dunno.  I knew I wasn't hardcore, I couldn't get into DAOC or Everquest just because 2 hour corpse runs, 30 seconds between pulls, and forming a group just to down mobs for dots of XP was way too much for me.  In contrast, WOW had a cool world, crazy things to discover, and just so much going for it.  Ironforge airfield, the world tree you could glitch to, etc.  It felt big and open and fun, and it also felt like it wanted me to come explore it.
---
In contrast, I'd say later WOW is statistical, dry, and clearly "balanced" by people who are extremely concerned with numbers, and not at all concerned with what feels cool and awesome to the players.  It's a dry, controlled experience, that's very polished, but lacks a certain sense of wonder for me.
---
But I wouldn't say one is more "hardcore" than the other, nor is either of them particularly hardcore.  You could play Dark Souls for a much more "hardcore" experience.
---
K.
---
Get out more kid.
---
Elves are *just better* than the normie humans. The king humans are special and elf-y.
---
yeah if i remember correctly the early quests have you draining a Naru that the bloodelf had captures or something
---
&gt;Don’t call others names, **imply derogatory things about them**
---
Please stop violating rule 2 of this subreddit sir. 
---
If you did less dps than the tank then you are just bad bro.
---
Explains what mate?
---
Pre-nerf C'thun you mean when tentacles spawns in stomach and Giant Claw Tentacles spawns in the walls and under floor? huh? 
---
I totally agree with the guy above. 
---
Fucking with the class talents / balance is probably among the top 5 things they could do to get me not to play. 
---
Well, I'm not wrong about anything I said, because I only confirmed ret works up to ZG and was never insulted. And classic will definitely be more casual than private servers - fringe services mainly attract fringe users, while classic will be right in the mainstream. So hopefully we'll see less of this elitism in a pickup group. If it was a guild and then I'd say there's a responsibility to go holy.
---
Nothing buddy don't worry about it. You have a good day now.
---
Well done, completely avoid the point because you never had one to begin with.
---
If anything, people will be frowning on it more now than back then, with all the overwhelming evidence on your performance in raids and vs other classes in your spec of choice. If you don't perform well consistently, you'll rightfully be shut down for trying something that won't work.
---
Yeah he was always in a group with my rogue and the other 2 highest dps. The other class in my group is a hunter! Gotta get that trueshot aura!
---
Unless your name is K.
---
Or your name is Get out more.
---
Then I've done nothing of the sort. However if you are so pent up with aggression that a game you've not paid for in 10 years (therefore can't have played and therefore have no idea what has been happening in the game to be upset about) can offend you to the point to complain on a sub Reddit of a game that is yet to be released, bashing people for being excited about a game they asked for, and therefore are passionate about. 
---
Then I would advise. For your personal health. To go outside, maybe invest in socialising and possibly a punch bag. For your sake... Not for ours. 
---
Good luck outside.
---
Please stop implying that I am an anti-social loser. That is a violation of rule 2 and therefore extremely not allowed on this here subreddit buddy.
---
Never was 
---
I absolutely feel you. I’ll probably never forget how I felt upon making my first character and coming up upon Orgrimmar as it loomed from the distance and eclipsed the horizon as I came from Razor Hill. I was really blown away. A city! With players inside! And I heard about Thrall making this place in Warcraft 3!! It really felt so free and unforgiving at the same time. It was an amazing balance of unmerciless combat and mistakes... Along with a genuinely heartwarming sense of community, and passion. I played Burning Crusade, but could quickly tell the game was moving in a direction I didn’t enjoy. And it was a shame, because that wasn’t the game I bought, but nothing lasts forever.
---
As for “hardcore”, I guess it’s all about relativity, because there were people and guilds on my realm that achieved WAY more than I, without putting in THAT much more time, but there were also people that spent their lives ingame, without much to show for it. I suppose most EQ players considered even the most invested of us “casual”, but even within WoW, players in the upper echelons appended that same label to people playing the same game, so I guess like most things in life, it was all relative
---
Yeah man I'm just here to sow discord and undermine the efforts of the noble Classic WoW team. 
---
Wasn’t it Ion who proved it?
---
Seems like it. All good I’ve reported you. 
---
I never said you were anti-social. Or a loser. I'm guessing you have jumped to these conclusions almost as quick as you've jumped to bash a community about its excitement for a game yet to be released. 
---
I'm merely stating that there are health benefits to going outside. That what you are doing, is unhealthy.
---
Stress is actually a killer. Channel it correctly.
---
Because this is a caring place.
---
Because it's not vanilla. Vanilla wasn't meant to be perfect, or to please everybody. It was only meant to be vanilla.  
---
It's not about us and what we want, it's about vanilla and the reality of what it is.  
---
When the alternative is having a grab bag full of useless specs and classes. I don't see how that is preferable. Unless you play a holy priest and like being the special snowflake that always gets top raid slot. 
---
Cthun was literally unbeatable before the "nerf" because the fight was bugged as shit
---
Cheers mate!
---
 I worries mate 
---
playing for fun by ruining others that's why u get told to get shot in the head
---
Yes, M'uru, who is later a boss in Sunwell.
---
Wow calm down buddy no need to defend yourself. I'm not going to report you. Besides, as long as you are on Blizzard's side here you've got nothing to worry about. Relax!
---
Oh I'm merely stating the truth. 
---
Honestly... Go outside, you'll feel much better for it. Fresh air does wonders. 
---
Good luck outside. Just remember! You can't always get what you want, especially when you contribute nothing to it. 
---
then let it go man lol
---
&gt;Never was
---
&gt;I worries mate
---
It seems you've been caught in a logic trap, my friend. Looks like I win this round hehe
---
Sorry mate, spell check, I meant no worries.
---
From Wowwiki, "Most quests for an Alliance or Horde faction will give full reputation gain for that faction, and one quarter of that reputation gain for the other factions on that side. For example, a quest completed for a Stormwind NPC will give 250 Stormwind reputation and 62.5 reputation for the other Alliance factions."
---
You don't absolutely have to turn in cloth. You can also do all the quests in every zone that give faction rep of any kind and get to Exalted through splashover rep. It's the easiest way to get Exalted with all of them. I used to do this to level in BC, doing all the starting zones, then all the secondary zones, etc etc, and could hit exalted with all home factions by the mid-40s. I liked being the lvl45 rando with the cross-faction mounts so I did it on every alt I made.
---
Because, as we all know, basic maths changed a lot in the past 15 years. 
---
This (imo) is the biggest hot-button issue for classic to me.
---
Personally, i wouldn't mind a few love-tap changes to make certain meme specs at least somewhat viable. But there's also a large portion of players who think (most) any divergence from the true vanilla experience is a sin.
---
I don't think there's a right or wrong side to it tbh. And considering how shitty retail class balance has been for BfA, i have very little faith they could manage to change anything without making it seem out of place.
---
I did let it go. 10 years ago. Are you missing something?
---
I just started on a private server. 
---
I’m a Wrath baby. 
---
I’m level 45 already.
---
So far, I’ve had no problems buying a mount. I’ve never ran out of quests yet. I’ve never grinded mobs yet. 
---
I’m on the most Blizzlike server there is, and don’t think the game has been especially hard yet. 
---
I did this to see if all the people who say they’ve been around since Vanilla are full of shit. So far, they are.
---
As I general rule I don't take advice from redditors.
---
That's plausible, but it's just hard to say until we see how many casuals there will actually be in the game. Could be more people from retail than we expect
---
You've come to a place of information exchange where you take nothing from the information. 
---
K. Seems about right.
---
I'm not sure I should accept your apology my friend. You've been quite hostile to me and I feel aggrieved. 
---
All good mate. Wasn’t a formal apology anyway.
---
Interesting theory, but I promise you there were plenty of rp friendly names available at all times. It wasn't that strict. Your name just had to be passable as an actual name. 
---
That would be the about the equivalency to saying I'm a resto druid healer, and spend the entire raid in bear form because I don't want to die to the boss mechanics.
---
In a 40 man raid, you do what your class can best contribute to the kill. Unlike 5 mans, everyone's most effective role is a specialized task because there is not really any need for any single person to do more than 1 role.  That is what the other 39 people are for unlike in a 5 man where you don't have that luxory.
---
In a PvE raid environment, if your class is the best at tanking, you need to tank.  If your class is the best dps, you need to dps your ass off to reduce the length of the fight for the healers. If your class can heal, then you need to be there healing so the other classes can do their role, too. 
---
Ret paladins do none of these. Hence why they are ok in 5 mans where they can spot heal or off tank in between their occasional burst damage, but not in a raid where they need to be doing 1 single thing balls to the wall all the time.  The only thing a paladin can do that well, that efficiently, is heal.
---
Reddit isn't an information exchange, it's an information distributor - in particularly, it serves to distribute corporate and political propaganda. Inasmuch as that data has any value it must be contextualized in that light. 
---
Give it a year before Blizzard starts taking a wrench to the game. The game will never survive as a time capsule. Vanilla is not about the esoteric details of the limitations of each and every class. Its a design ethos that permeated through the entire game. That's vanilla. 
---
I'm surprised, and here I thought you'd really realized the errors of your ways.
---
Which people can reply to. Regardless of how you see it... Their giving their views and exchanging thoughts and information. It is therefore information exchange.
---
I come here for answers the same way I'm happy to give answers. The exchange of knowledge through a board.
---
Thanks for visiting though! 
---
Hit was always the heaviest weighted stat, but it's still interesting to know how heavily. Is 1% hit better than 50ap? 100? 200? I'm hoping someone will come up with a SimCraft for Classic so we can actually easily test for it. 
---
In terms of PvE Maladath is actually the best weapon of those you listed.
---
This. I get having more toys and transmog and stuff, but I feel like the lore is a big part you're ignoring. You say there's more lore, but is it good lore? I know you say to just ignore it and that any RPer would, but as a long-time wow rper, we don't. The reason we're rping in wow and not on some other platform is because we enjoy the lore and the world wow has created and want to make stories within it.
---
As an example, if you wanted to rp in a Horde that was more true to WC3/Vanilla Horde, why would you go ''okay, I'm gonna go to Retail where the Horde are saturday morning cartoon villains but at least I have more toys''??? I can say with confidence that stuff like that is way more important than any amount of toys or transmog or whatever. Stuff like that, in addition to (most people on here) preferring the gameplay of Classic, will ensure that most people who want to play Classic and also want to RP, will do so in Classic. Just my 2 cents
---
Redditors are just vectors through which propaganda operates and interacts. It begins at the structural level, the meta in which this supposed 'exchange' occurs. 
---
Glad you said it was an exchange. 
---
Goodnight.
---
The use of quotations in this context indicates that I am using your words, not mine. 
---
Communicate cross faction rp on your realm discord? You seem very dedicated in spreading fake news 
---
Yeeep. This is just also from what I've seen on my server (Moon Guard) but if Scarlet Crusade RPers want to go RP in a place like say, Stormwind, they're usually really loud and open about it, and then it always ends up becoming some big fight where they flip their lid at death knight players, and then the death knight players flip their lid back at them because they aren't even supposed to exist, yada yada. It's not a good system!
---
Thought it was bonus to resisting detection, not ms :s
---
Is it bizzare? All information so far indicates that we're getting the game we've been asking for (or *very* close to it, all things considered). Even getting this far gives me tons of faith in the folks working on Classic. Meanwhile, retail is in a very problematic way. 
---
Even keyboard-turning clickers can outdps tanks.
---
If they did that I'd be okay with them eventually gearing ret for sure.
---
I've been in a guild like that. I'll take a LC guild over that one any day of the week. What a fucking joke.
---
The two of you gonna cut all this sexual tension and get a room or what? I’m pulling out my robe and wizard hat as we speak. 
---
I think it is this tendency to disassociate Classic WoW development from Activision-Blizzard broadly speaking that is behind a lot of what I see as misplaced optimism on this sub. 
---
I'm going to guess that you now understand why he's being down voted based on his responses to you lmao. 
---
Was looking for a comment lile this, thanks.
---
He already PM'd me but I had to decline unfortunately...
---
I learnt more than I ever wanted to learn, rofl
---
I'd just take mining, then level eng once I hit 60. It's such a pain to level imo. Take skinning at your leisure if you feel like it before then but unless I felt like using it to farm devilsaurs I personally wouldn't bother.
---
Mid 20s is usually when casuals drop it from my experience.
---
They have given us multiple reasons to.
---
Best guess would be that if you're being THAT serious about your raid composition, you would have just recruited the right players to meet the comp you want in the first place. 
---
It might have been a tbc thin but it’s supposed to be both.
---
You're going to wait until zg to get geared? No you're not :p
---
Can confirm. When I was a kb turning clicker noob, I would often outdps tanks 
---
I'm a Cata baby and my experience has been similar. Although I had trouble buying a mount/getting gold in general, probably because I wasn't trying especially hard to grind gold. I was aware it was a thing I should do, I just could never be assed.
---
The game honestly isn't hard, it's just more time consuming and more punishing in some ways. Levelling a warrior can be painful as fuck because you make a single wrong move and you're probably dead. Hell, you get a few unlucky misses and you're dead.
---
Yep.
---
Vehemens - Darksorrow EU
---
Except a warrior is tankier than a paladin. So that story doesn't really make sense.
---
BDevils, you are one of the most zealous pro-Protadin players on this sub. I know little about you, but I presume that you are in a guild or a group of consistent players who indulge your memey gearing needs.
---
The problem with you coming into these threads all the time is that your experience is an outlier—abnormal.
---
You're effectively giving bad advice by not acknowledging the hidden external advantages that you personally have that most other players will not.
---
Then those players who you manage to hoodwink will end up making fools of themselves out in the world and poison the well for Protadins further.
---
...
---
Actually... now that I write that out... forget everything I said. Please continue fighting the pro-Protadin fight! 
---
I wish they would do that. Instead they'll incessantly beg for balance changes.
---
1. Vendorstrike
---
2. Lion Horn of SW

---
First of all you dont get to decide what is and what isnt Vanilla. These esoteric details seemed to be plenty popular on private servers. 
---
Secondly, you cant get the design ethos back. The people responsible for that have abandoned ship several years ago. If you want the game to be like BFA, then go play BFA. If you dont want that, then dont expect Activision Blizzard to be able improve the game. The best thing they can do is deliver Classic in a Vanilla state. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
At first glance I thought the image was trying to say that Nathanos and Drake were lookalikes.
---
Hunters want might+wisdom. But you're still right since they don't need salv.
---
probably level 20 when they realise they still need 20 more levels before the first mount.
---
Oh how the game would be so much more enjoyable without addons. 
---
But it's okay if I play holy paladin purely with int plate gear right? Otherwise I won't be wearing a dress/playing the class I guess.
---
Keep in mind two things:
---
1: Early respecs are very, very cheap. Like dirt cheap. Unless you’re ping ponging around specs you’re really not saving money by never respeccing
---
2: Warriors are insanely gear dependant, none more so than in their weapon spot. If you find a great 2H or stumble upon two great 1H’s you need to be flexible enough to adapt. You will actually be losing money if you take more damage and kill things slower because you decided to keep crappy weapons to save money on talent respecs.
---
????????????
---
Vanilla had class overhauls with almost literally every major patch. Right from the start Blizzard was trying to iterate and make more things viable. They just didn't succeed at it until TBC.
---
What you mean is that your only experience with meaningful Vanilla is on private servers locked to patch 1.12.1.
---
So you didn't play actual Vanilla? You know, those 2 years of major patches which overhauled almost every class in the game at various points?
---
I just realized that too as OP was talking about Prot Warriors..... whoops.
---
Lvling with dual wield is pretty hard, but its your choice for raiding for sure.
---
2H arms is so much better for lvling(especially at PvP realms).
---
You have: imp.Overpower+Deep Wounds+Tactical Matery+weapon spec+Sweeping Strikes+Mortal Strike.
---
Also theres much easy to find good one 2H than 2x 1H, and ofc you don't have any +hit on your gear, so misses will be so common for you when dual wielding.
---
Enrage /sit macro, low crit chance Flurry and low AP Bloodthrist is worse.
---
About weapon skill:
---
you ez can raise your weapon skill while farming your pre-raid gear.
---
No, that is what happens when you do less damage than tank.
---
Judging by some comments here, most of those people came to this sub.
---
Even if you level solo with 2H weapons, your 1H weapon skills should keep pace when you tank instances.
---
My thought exactly. Keep the criticisms to issues that we know about, IE: sharding and looting (until we learn more when beta launches) and keep the feedback civil. If I was on the Classic team and I came here all I saw was incoherent flaming about how Classic will fail because of what we've seen from Blizzard recently, I would leave and never come back. People go on forums such as this one and constantly flame Blizzard and then wonder why they don't visit there anymore to receive feedback. 
---
Another reason to stick to PvP when Classic comes and I roll my Ret.
---
Would you happen to have one with XP values in stead of %?
---
And thanks for posting it btw 
---
Genius. 
---
Might is melee attack power only in vanilla, so it's quite useless to hunters. It wasn't changed to flat attack power until tbc.
---
**N I C E**
---
Yeah, my characters did all their stuff in Darnassus.  
---
No one was ever there, except for newly rolled nelves, so I was free to move around without problems.  
---
&gt;I know there's some significant lore behind Blood efl paladins and Draenei shamans. **Arguably this lore really sucks**
---
The guys from /r/warcraftlore would kill you for saying that.
---
wat.jpg
---
&gt; This meant things like waiting before entering a big city or 5 FPS at a raid.
---
As of today, to go above 5 fps I had to set the resolution to 1024x768.  
---
Damn Blizzard and the impossibility of deactivating particle effects!
---
Kowalski analysis
---
Your goal early on is to capitalize on profession profits so you can make the most gold possible for mounts, gear and enchants.  Engineering early on is probably one of the weaker profession lines to go down. There are a few things you can create like specific parts, scopes and guns but they aren't a big money maker like mining, sharding or skinning. 
---
if I recall, a respec starts at 1g, then goes to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. until 50.
---
So even if the first couple are "cheap" you're still getting it to the more expensive rate much quicker, is this incorrect?
---
You just described every mass-invite guild ever. Usually, they also have stupid guild names.
---
That the amount of gold does not change (which is true) does not tackle the main issue: gold becomes distributed according to real money.
---
Which always happen to some extent (farmers) , but never as much as when it's actually approved by Blizzard. 
---
I don't believe it's just optimism - for me, it's been genuine showings of good faith and understanding of what Classic needs to be that's built confidence. Things I see as genuine reasons to be positive about the project.
---
Does this mean I'm not disappointed by some of the showings from Activision-Blizzard as of late? Of course not. But it seems odd to me to decry everything they're doing and might ever do as doomed because of this. 
---
That sounds awesome. Are you planning to actual do rp and larger rp events?
---
We're gonna have Classic next year, what is the point of this post ? 
---
Yeah, it's a horrible idea. You will waste your time facing smash your keyboard because you are missing and doing partial damage. 
---
Agreed 🤣
---
Indeed we are! Both RP and PvP events. We already have someone very experienced in RP who will be in charge of those things. (Participation is not mandatory; it's only for those who want to RP)
---
Some of us have already started on our background stories :)
---
It needs to be saved from elitist assholes that will cuss anyone that doesn't play they want to play.
---
Dude, first grade has no exams.
---
&gt; It's like someone died.
---
Mike Morhaime. Not literally, but still....
---
I'm pretty sure they will have at least one rp and one rp-pvp server. I just hope that the community will tag one server and make it a very dedicated rp server. I'm planning to play on rp-pvp EU. Doing Rp was some of the best time I had in World of Warcraft and I'm looking forward to rp again.
---
Well if he is doing less dps than the tank, it's just that he is bad. Even with a memespec with proper gear you should at least do more dps than the tank.
---
“Truth isn’t truth”
---
Undeads are not corpses.
---
Sorry to tell you but neither is viable if the group is equally geared. It's just one big waste of time not only for you but your whole group. Neither paladin nor shaman have taunt abilities and they will go OOM every couple of pulls. 
---
Shaman --&gt; Spam Earth shock, refresh lighting shield, use AOE taunt totem.
---
Paladin --&gt; Spam low level Holy-shield, spam consecration and have righteous fury up.
---
I did it on my paladin and it's a gimmick/novelty at best. 
---
 
---
&gt; but getting outDPSed by the tanks
---
t. never played World of Warcraft
---
2 handed weapons are pvp spec. pally healers should get to roll on that
---
I've run a lot of organized RP-PvP campaigns over the years(more than I would like), and your idea is generally how a lot of campaigns are handled outside of gameplay. Though they are generally run in a linear fashion-- That is, fight over a designated zone on day 1, and the outcome determines a story aspect which decides where the next round will be fought. Tally victory points at the end(since not everyone likes PvP and there were probably some d20 or other non-PvP activities), and declare a winner.
---
However, your plans for the actual combat will... Lead to undesired outcomes. Players never behave exactly how you want them to, unless you are preparing for the Eternal Constants of RP-PvP: Refusal to accept defeat by accusing the other side of breaking some rule or having too many players, and DRAMA to the highest degree. I can tell you right now your event would see at most three active rounds of fighting, with less and less every time. People want to win, and the losing side will likely be outnumbered, and they will have a free fall bleed of participants when they lose. The most optimal way to run RP PvP campaigns, among the group of leaders I've interacted and worked with for years, is rounds of 20v20. Servers may be able to handle 40v40's reliably on Classic, but safer is better(also more numerous stories).
---
I'm explaining this in detail not to say you have a bad idea, but to help you draft realistic expectations. I hate to see idealism crushed by the overly dramatic reaction of players to the slightest inconvenience.
---
If you want to bounce ideas off of me, feel free to DM me. I have a big interest in seeing the RPPVP community flourish on Classic!
---
Yes. Really you only have two options.  
---
* Play a spec you can live with for everything you want to do (usually that means either picking being sub par at PvE or PvP, maybe working out another way of making money other than killing things if you want to play a tank/healer).  
---
* Set aside X hours/week to make gold for how much you want to respec a week. Typically people raid 3 days a week and pvp/farm the other 4, so they need to respec twice a week to play the one character like that. So you need to set aside 2-3 hours every week to farm the 100g to cover it.
---
The OTs are already fury specced and good luck with convincing a warrior with dps spec and gear to gimp himself by using a Nightfall. Also a warrior can't keep the debuff up properly. 
---
Also, in the end, vanilla raids are extremely easy and min-maxing is not required unless your raid is braindead. 
---
/sit won't work on classic. It's a PS 'feature'.
---
&gt; even won a bg or two
---
AV doesn't count :p
---
Having an impossible boss is pointless. It wasn’t that C’thun was nerfed, it’s that he was fixed. 
---
Pre nerf yogg saron was also "proven" to be impossible to defeat even with BIS gear and a chinese guild still managed to do it.
---
With all the hardcore min maxer that exist today, i'm pretty sure they would be able to do it.
---
Finally my computer can handle Iron Forge/Stormwind. 
---
My guild used to give them to paladins as a joke. SMH
---
Well, compared to what they must be used to nowadays, it's a masterpiece of fine literature.
---
lol is this make azeroth great again?
---
While he might not be wrong about ret as a spec, I hope his vitriol doesn't get far on Classic servers :I
---
I would say that if at least 1 player out of the whole population does not buy gold because of being afraid from being banned (which does not happen often indeed), then it's a win already.
---
Even if it only decreases 5% of the $ spent for gold (and I think it's much more because I think the fear of third-party sellers does exist, even if I don't feel it myself), then IMO it should be done. But I perfectly get your point of view.
---
judgement of command is melee hit
---
chimone brew, its pretty fucking easy to outdps the tanks even taking all the passives. you just suck.
---
Excellent work
---
&gt; easiest levelling class pulling you on
---
ROFL, enjoy buying 2x the food, buying arrows or pellets and less bag space. With a mage you can actually kill whole camps and get free water+food.
---
Also players like this directly take loot from 800+ dps players who took the time to learn the class, farm pre-bis and consumables. While this ret rolls in contributes almost anything and takes loot.
---
how do paladins counter locks?
---
I didn't even mention world of warcraft. I said I've played blizzard games...for 14 years. 
---
Yes, they have screwed up live. BFA is a disaster. 
---
But that isn't even the start of the problem. Blizzard as a whole have become money hungry, corporate, mindless drones just like every other company out there that lack the passion to create  something that their fans actually want. 
---
Dude has been updating his guide, he will be even faster and he will be the record holder again. And those other guys play on servers that have easier enemies and the experience rates are wrong.
---
a friend with raiding experience on private servers said "C'thun kills guilds"
---
Early on 1 handers should absolutely be going to warriors for pve, 2hand fury is very competitive dps on horde side especially early on. 
---
Just play a night elf if you die alot ;) 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; In a 40 man raid, you do what your class can best contribute to the kill. Unlike 5 mans, everyone's most effective 
---
Well the short answer is: You take out other healers to have 4+ holy Pallys and dont take a ret. 
---
Of course its all about minmaxing (like bringing one holy specced into shadow weaving instead of a full shadow) and if your guild doesnt care about it so much (hence its not even nessecary in the end) you can totally bring a ret to the raid, same with an enhancer, ele, boomy or shadow.
---
There will be a big die-off at 60 when most retail players realise that instead of the "deep, skillful" gameplay that Vanilla players promised, they understand that the real truth is that most DPS rotations are literally spamming one or two buttons, and the encounters are not a skill check other than the ability for the raid leader to herd 40 idiots and how much time those idiots are willing to devote to farm garbage out in the world.
---
actually the talent reduces their spell power coefficient. still a great spec 
---
I think going Mining+Engineering from the start is only worth it if you actively level Engineering so much that you are always able to use the ore - once you fall behind in Engineering and have to for example find copper to level Engineering but have already outleveled the copper areas it becomes quite tedious to backtrack, which means you either stop leveling Engineering until you're 60 or you have to buy stuff in the auction house to catch up - both options suck, especially when you still need your mounts.
---
The smartest route is probably to go for Mining/Skinning until 60, but personally I'll definitely go for Mining/Engi because grenades are too much fun to pass up.
---
I also think you should either go all the way to 60 with Mining+Skinning or start with Mining+Engi right away. Changing it around 30-40 sounds hard to do because you won't have enough space in your bank to store all the ore you find and to me it's likely that ore and all the other resources will only get more expensive with each week for at least half a year, as more and more gold enters the economy, so you'll likely make a loss going that route in my opinion.
---
I like watching Shedo's Twitch stream, it's super fun and chill and he goes all out.
---
But damn is it depressing when he accidentally dies, just once, because he loses all the world buffs + rare consumables. The entire night is pretty much ruined because he falls to the bottom of the DPS meters.
---
:(
---
This one
---
This is probably the best comment here. 
---
Imagine if a hunter started raptor striking the boss claiming it's how they enjoyed to play, you wouldn't pander to them unless it was a close guild with friends. 
---
I have played Ret a lot in WoW and while I would say the vanilla spec is totally viable if you put effort in, you really do need to push yourself as a player to be competitive. 
---
If you're not prepared to learn stat weightings or BIS gearing for a Ret then I wouldn't advise raiding as one. 
---
I really don't think Blizzard is ever going to do any sort of balancing or new content for Vanilla in any capacity. Doing that requires hiring game designers, balance designers, balance QA testers, all of this bullshit when they could alternatively just say "Nah we're going to keep it faithful to vanilla" and that will be satisfactory for 95% of the community. Sure there are many people who would prefer some updates to vanilla, but the reality is that those people won't quit if changes ARENT made. 
---
Much easier to just go through with TBC, which will give most people the changes they want in regards to gearing and balance. It will come at the expense of the community of the vanilla servers that don't migrate to TBC (because a bunch of people will quit) but that's not a huge problem and can be addressed later. 
---
Thats what I will most likely do. Im not a fan of healing, but Pally is my class. Since retri isnt really viable and prot has limited uses, I will go into holy for that 20 Points to mainly heal in raid and put the rest into prot for Sanc/reckoning and maybe holy shield so I can offtank creeps (onyxia whelps, Nefarian adds, naxxramas Spiders etc) and also can faceroll in pvp via reckoning (when I get a 2h of course).
---
I lead a raiding guild on a "certain server" that allowed a few meme spec players. We had one balance druid, one retribution paladin, and one feral druid DPS. Funnily enough these players actually did more DPS and contributed more to raid than a lot of our "normal specced" players, because of the amount of effort they put in.
---
They always went above the expected when it came to consumable use and raid preparation, never failed to follow boss tactics, etc. which overcame the "meme spec". 
---
Basically, meme spec good player &gt; normal spec bad player. But of course on two equally skilled players, take the normal spec any day. And meme spec bad player would be a complete nightmare.
---
Modifying vanilla just seems like so much work when the reality is that 99% of the people who want balance changes really just want TBC. Release vanilla, then release TBC. Everybody who wants changes on Vanilla immediately quits their vanilla server forever and plays TBC. Everybody is happy at the end of the day. Except maybe the one group of people who don't want TBC but also want vanilla balance changes, but I'm skeptical about whether that group actually exists. 
---
That doesn't make it right. I think what these companies fail to realise that, if instead of trying to squeeze every last penny out of a smaller player base, and they tried to create a game with passion that attracted massive popularity, they could sustain that by not being greedy and only charging a reasonable subscription. And in the long run, probably earn the same amount of money. 
---
Bloodlust vs Heroism, very different icons popping over your party's head
---
it would not be easy money. if they want to remaster d2 and do it right it has to feel the exact way and be 2d like diablo 2 was and not 3d like diablo 3. it will be a hard task to make a good d2 remake 
---
That's good then, because the Paladin rolling for 2handers won't affect the Horde fury 2h
---
Its a core feature that you get critted whule sitting ir l
---
Pretty wild seeing all the meta slaves in here ready to treat classic like a job. Makes me wonder how far it'll be from what classic was, before everyone was obsessed with doing stuff optimally.
---
Ok so what, maybe 1 week of dev ? (randomly throwing numbers)
---
I mean if a window takes 1 months to be developped properly then seing the huge amount of work required for classic it should take them 3 years. Either way it requires works, but not sure it require a "huge amount" of work. Even counting the "research phase in it" since changes in ptr happen in a matter of days for example.
---
Judgement is a metal dress.
---
There will be tickets related to ninja group loot trading anyway. There will be any sort of tickets as long as its not officially stated that tickets will not be accepted.
---
wut? are you really implying the game would be better without dps meters? how the hell are you supposed to find weak links in your group without them, or even see how you compare against others?
---
when you’re bashing your head against a wall because a boss won’t die are you supposed to just ask people “hey man you think you’re doing good dps? yeah? well too bad neither of us have any way of knowing haha”
---
&gt;  Plus, if people are going to 'accidentally" need they're probably going to "accidentally" accept. It's just an extra layer of nuisance for everybody.
---
The solution is to remove the whole loot trading system and add the window only for raids or master looter mode.
---
I mean, if you go or let or allow master loot in dungeon instead of need or greed then everything that happens next is pretty much your own responsability.
---
Yikes man.  You're the one telling people to shutup for voicing their criticism, with only good intentions to improve the game.
---
Engineering isn't to expensive if you mine a lot. There is a truck load of recipes but I'd recommend only buying the ones you need immediately and the ones that will allow you to level efficiently. There's only a few recipes that require buying expensive mats as most are just mined. You will need far more minerals then you might think so I'd highly recommend creating a bank alt just for this (and store future engineering recipes you can't learn yet as well). Most engineering guides will focus on powders and bombs which are of course super useful for pvp but take the time to learn and make jumper cables and also make a few target dummies. Those things WILL save your life in the pve. 
---
I know, and they’re trying to silence me.
---
different mobs have different XP values, even at the same level
---
if you don't have the willpower or free time to deal with a once in a lifetime MMO experience, I have to say you're pretty babyish and casual.
---
Suck it up, just because the game isn't going to feed you with a silver spoon doesn't mean it won't be fun.  
---
You'll think fondly when you're older about the experiences of fighting for that one mob.
---
I love seeing new people be this retarded. It never gets old. 
---
the evidence is a decade of activision bullshit
---
We need to make sure loot trading and especially sharding does not make it to the launch of Classic.
---
They are both cost cutting practices that **need** to be removed.
---
Also, its hard not to criticize Blizzard with everything going on atm. And the fact that russian neckbeards can provide a stabler and increased realm cap servers its just embarrassing that you would think to defend a multi billion dollar company from not spending money on actually good servers that back in the day could have atleast 40v40 no prob.
---
It will not be in Classic.
---
It's only the demo..
---
It's only the beta, come one guys...
---
It's launch they'll fix it next patch...
---
Well next expansions will do it differently for sure!
---
Awesome! Is there a way to connect with you guys?
---
That was like a few hours worth of play time depending on how fast you were back in the day...oof. 
---
I used to roll toons when I was bored just to have fun leveling in those early 5 mans and starting areas 
---
100% it won't be in the game 
---
Probably not- and if there was dual-spec, people would certainly flip their shit. 
---
It's about the spirit of the game the way that it was. Making decisions that had impact, and sacrifices too. (Spending gold to re-spec or hybridizing, etc).
---
It’s not supposed to be in the game, but then again neither is sharding or loot trading so sadly I wouldn’t rule it out. 
---
&gt; be loud about. 
---
Poeple do realize it.
---
We also realize we don't need people spamming the exact same threads here daily for those issues. We have talked them to death, and this place isnt even checked by Blizzard. **Take your daily spam and Doomsaying about Sharding and loot trading to the official forums where it can be heard if thats what you are TRULY after.**
---
But something tells me thats not it....
---
Because they exploited the fight so one of the key boss mechanics was completely ignored...
---
Oof. Bit of a bummer. Probably roll a healer but I always hated respeccing back in the day - especially if I just wanted to do some BGs as a DPS spec . It was just such a huge quality of life upgrade. I cant even remember when it was initially introduced 
---
\#nochanges
---
Yeah, if you are wanting people to whine about the same sharding, loot trading things daily then make a sticky for it. I'm tired of 30 threads a day on the same garbage recycling the same stuff from the same posters in a place that Blizzard doesn't even read!
---
It makes no sense.
---
You did naxx40 progression and full cleared naxx 40 as a ret paladin?
---
It doesn't matter. Even if u r a good one you usually won't be able to prove yourself much. Or at least that's my experience.
---
and you're not going to want to throw away 1/6/16g on respecs before you get your mount.
---
Man. These comments make me question if I really want to play classic.
---
Of course!
---
Website: https://pertento.eu
---
Discord: https://discord.gg/MMPjyX
---
I dont mind a ret getting sulfuras or whatever, but no RoA or onslaught girdle for you!
---
I'm of the belief that the game has had 15 years of development - even during the classic period where a lot of fixes and changes improved the game. 
---
What I'm hoping for is the same experience but with some of those quality of life improvements that came along over the years - 
---
I'm curious how they'll be handling class balance - if we'll just go through the cycle of bad balance and broken class buffs/nerfs or if they'll end up using the best tested numbers 
---
Look mom I posted it again.
---
Didn't think green mobs gave so little!
---
Yes. However in vanilla many guilds didn't utilize nightfall until burn phases like cthun and then loatheb.  
---
Mathematically a hunter has better overall uptime on nightfall though.  An enh shaman brings improved wf and earth totem. What does a ret bring? Imp might is tier 1. 
---
You don't need to be at 100% to beat any raid in Van. So it's not carrying. If you breeze through content and don't wipe no one was carrying anyone. 
---
You want as much weapon skill amd +hit as possible to make dual-weilding work. I don't usually respec for that until I have about +5 hit, which usually means in the 50s at earliest.
---
I'm not sure if you're serious or not but I'll bite.
---
No hunter should be buying food for their pet, which I'm assuming you mean by 2x the food. Most pets eat meat and meat drops from like 50% of the things you kill.
---
Ammo is cheap. The most expensive arrows cost something like 10s for 200. You'll get 10s from like 2 mobs.
---
Less bag space sure.
---
Hunters can kill whole camps with proper CC. Trap 1 mob, tank another, DPS down 1-2. Casually kill single mobs afterwards to regain hp/mana.
---
Everyone would be a warrior then. Yuck.
---
I mean I get that, but it also was one of the least engaging and fun aspects of the game back in the day - especially if you were a tank. One of the big opportunities that dual specs offered was increasing the number of tanks and healers to group with. Even if you weren't a tank main, being able to switch to a tank spec for a raid or a 5 man made grouping 100x easier. 
---
I specifically remember spending hours sitting in LFG trying to find tanks and healers - sometimes just not being able to find one at all. 
---
Was not a good time lol 
---
Totally get what you're saying. To each his own. Short answer is that it won't be included tho.
---
&gt; Do raids actually bring enough Paladin healers to cover all pally buffs? 
---
I mean Holy Paladin is considered to be the most efficient healer in the entire game, most top end raiders would rate them above Priests in healing.
---
They also have the best buffs in the entire game, so it's like a win-win. Best healer and best buffs, obviously you bring quite a few of them into every raid.
---
I think 4 Paladins is enough to cover every buff different classes need and usually I see around 4-6 Holy Paladins per raid.
---
There's no need to bring in a Ret Paladin to "compensate" for a buff when you can always make room for enough Holy Paladins to cover them all very easily.
---
Bringing in a Ret Paladin would be like going from a win-win combo to lose-win, why would anybody do that? They don't offer anything unique that a Holy Paladin wouldn't bring, they're just worse versions of the class.
---
That's also one thing that baffles me the most about people who want to play Retribution. You have access to the best healing spec in the entire game but instead of being one of the best healers in the game you want to downgrade yourself to do completely trash damage and be one of the worst classes in a raid, I don't get that.
---
If it was up to me to decide if I wanted to be at the top or bottom when it comes to the usefulness I bring to the raid I would never voluntarily choose the worse option.
---
I would understand peoples obsession over Ret way more if the damage wasn't the greatest but it brought some unique buff or debuff into the raid which would be up for debate.
---
But it literally doesn't bring anything unique, it just does bad damage.
---
I don't think it's a case of people "having fun" I think it's just a matter of some people wanting to be special snowflakes and play something unique that very few people in the game play and that makes them feel like they're special in some way because no one else in the raid is like them.
---
When I started playing WoW back in 2005 I played a Ret Paladin myself. Vanilla was my first 3D MMORPG experience and I didn't know that Paladins were supposed to heal or that Retribution was a terrible spec, so I played it all the way through vanilla because I didn't know what I was doing.
---
It wasn't until TBC came along and I really got into raiding that I went Holy and never looked back. I had a secondary gear for Protection for tanking heroics (because Paladin is the best tank for 5 mans in TBC) but literally never touched Retribution again in my life.
---
I probably won't play a Paladin when classic comes around, but as someone who actually played one back in retail I'd rather not play the game than be forced to play a Ret Paladin again personally. I don't see anything fun about it but that's just me.
---
Better than the 13% of the player base that will likely opt to be a tank. I don't know how many hours you spent in LFG chat back in the day, but I spent way too much time spamming /LFG "LF1M tank 5-man..." 
---
Enjoy the down time, maybe all that time spent drinking you can think about how to make a decent argument.
---
Even on alliance side 2 hand fury with BRE will out dps dal rends, im 95% positive spinal reaper would also, especially if the dps in non human.
---
&gt;Edit: gotta grind out at least 100 gold a week to switch back and forth after raids 😉 
---
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh. 
---
of course onslaught going to ret would be retarded... infact i dont think a ret paladin should get sulfuras over a holy pally if say that holy pally wanted it for pvp spec. its a prized pvp item
---
No computer can handle LAGforge and StormLAG
---
And this is why pserver elitism cancer should be put on their own server where they can be in Thier own little echo chamber and think people care if they get world first in a 12 year old dead race 
---
&gt; however I see nothing wrong with tanking 60 dungeons
---
I hit 60 on a private server a few weeks ago, my first private server experience.  I've been shocked at how few tanking warriors there are.
---
Dungeon groups are desperate for tanks, to the extent that I got paid 100g to tank DM West.  Tanks can also reserve the first Righteous Orb drops from Stratholme live.
---
People are happy for a feral druid to tank dungeons.  At the weekend I killed Nef and we had a feral offtanking at the start of the encounter as well as throughout BWL
---
Every class in Classic is viable, and has some role that they are best at. 
---
It is very hard to make every class good at every role without homogenization, so no I don't think they should rebalance things. 
---
The way Blizzard handled expansions was fundamentally wrong. They should have built on top of the existing content instead they threw it out the window and made players restart from square 1. They have since repeated this with every expansion. Its a terrible way to run a game. Blizzard set a precedent doing it like this way back in the day, it was fun at the time, yet fundamentally bad for the game.
---
MMO's need consistent and saved progress. Logging in one day and finding out all your achievements are meaningless because they just added a bunch of new content that made that irrelevant is ridiculous. 
---
A pair of green pants that dropped off a random demonic boar shouldn't outclass a pair of pants one had to slay a damn demi-god to get. 
---
Fuck TBC, Fuck Outland. I just want the game to be the best it can be. There is something to be said for wanting something "warts and all". Wabi Sabi and all that. 
---
But keeping bad features and mechanics that add literally nothing to the overall game play experience is just foolish in my opinion. 
---
A bullet-pointed list would take even less time but the point of the video was to entertain. Guy just likes to make content 
---
Not that I disagree with you, but the dude literally says ret palas should be shot in the head. I think in this case it's pretty clearly about the spec, and that OP would've caught shit regardless of his skill.
---
&gt; Assume your raid doesn’t need more healers, but is missing a pally buff. Why is Holy more valuable than Ret in this situation, when more healing is unnecessary?
---
This literally never happens. Already replied once but like I said in my last comment, the Priests and Paladins usually are divided pretty evenly into the raid.
---
When it comes to Resto Druids you only bring 1 or 2 of them and never more. The rest of the healing spots will be Priests and Paladins.
---
You might bring 2 Restoration Druids, 5 Priests and 5 Paladins and that makes up your healing roster. Obviously you can make some changes to that, like bring 1 less Druid and a couple of extra Paladins or Priests but you will never struggle to not fill a blessing because you don't need more healers.
---
The amount of healers you need by default in a raid makes it so every blessing gets covered by default because you need the numbers just to cover healing anyway.
---
You can watch any MC, BWL, AQ or Naxxramas private server raid on YouTube - there's countless of videos. I've never seen anyone bring less than a minimum of 4 Paladin healers in a raid, because even if in theory you wouldn't need the blessings you would still need them for purely healing because in a 40 man raid you need those numbers.
---
Gonna be patch 1.12. Although tier 2 and 3 raids as well as dire maul might be released in later patches. I totally understand wanting duel spec but it would completely change the game. As soon as content is on farm you would have a bunch of people begging to raid in there offspec. Also having respeccs as a gold dump will help with gold inflation as the servers get older. I would be ok with dual spec if it required a huge gold dump to get, like at least 2000 gold.

Legit the worst itemised weapon in MMO history imo.
---
"I'm regenerating 5 HP per 5 seconds and there's NOTHING you can do about it !"
---
I spent a solid hour laughing at that weapon when it dropped for me in Vanilla. It's a 2H sword with Spirit, Defense and a 2.80 speed. Literally useless/unusable for every class.
---
* Ret Paladin? - Defense and spirit with fast wep speed.
---
* Prot Paladin? - Nope, 2H.
---
* Holy? - Spirit, 2H.
---
* What about warriors: Same as paladins.
---
* DK's! -&gt; Nope, it requires level 26 and dk's start at level 55. Also, Vanilla.
---
* Hunter weapon! Really? Def, Spirit and fast speed as well as being a 2h?
---
* Druid then! -&gt; Nope, it's a 2H sword. Which rules out every other class too XD
---
True.  I'm sure you understand why people wince at seeing a pet use Growl, but it can be good.  Pets don't die in one or two hits, and it's much better for a pet to get it than a healer, especially on a Priest or Druid because cloth and armor's relative damage reduction was much lower back then and leather's was a little lower.
---
I think there will be a big drop off between 15-25, 15-20 is where you can really start to die a lot more, and 20+ for me is the first big leveling drop off point in terms of time spent.  My guess is there will be another smaller drop off in the late 30s, early 40s, that to me is the next area where you really start to feel how much leveling has slowed down.
---
I think around lvl 30-35 is a bigger check. It may be the place where gaining levels is starting to slow down, you need to travel between more zones to get that extra level, zones are starting to get contented, so you may get ganked much more.

Can't wait to see em :) 
---
Yeah, I was seeing several commenters going, "oh god wtf," and because I never stopped liking WoW all the way through Mists, I figured it would be helpful to provide all the info and design motivation.
---
It may sound like there was bias in describing why the buffs exist, but those really are the reasons the devs flat out gave though the exact wording is based on my own experiences.
---
The draenei shaman quests are mainly about the Exodar's crash messing up the elements. Horde shaman quests are more general shaman stuff.
---
ret pallies scale like poop. cons and judgement is based on sp and dont scale that well. cons from first dinging to t2.5 barley increases in damage. judgement does a fair bit with a stunned target. but really its 43% coeficient and you have like what, 220 spell power in ur full t2.5 gear? man they really needed to give ret paladins better coeficients with these spells, you can see how bad it is in tbc when ret gear no longer has any spell power and shockadins are critting 2.5k judgements and ur critting for like 500 judgements on players with resilence
---
Ah okay, I remember EXP from elites, including ones in dungeons, was considerably higher than normal enemies, but I couldn't remember if it was high enough to be worth it with them having about 3x more health.
---
I really gotta go with OP on this one. Even if he got carried, as long as the boss died easy, what kind of person gives enough fucks to send a message, let alone tell someone they should die?
---
People bringing up endgame raiding and class balance philosophy are really arguing outside the scope of these 6 lines of dialog.
---
I thought that was Kripp and his guild, then the chinese actually killed it
---
Thats vainilla class design for you. The hard truth is that if you have to choose between the top specs/classes or the spec/class you like, you are better off not playing at all. You will spend a lot of hours leveling abd loving a character just to find that you are just a far worse version of other character abd only friends and guildies will ever want to play with you.
---
Like, 80% of the population of the server is going to be warrior/mage/rogue. Then there is going to be a few precious hybrids who go heal and then the rest of the classes/specs who will just be laughed at.
---
By 'exploit' do you mean them just stacking aff locks who could dps while looking away to avoid the sanity draining ability? Aff locks who also did crazy execution phase dps where it mattered? 
---
I'd put that more in the clever usage of game mechanics than exploiting.
---
Yea, was just thinking about it. When I went to my first lvl 55-60 dungeons, I had a few blues from older dungeons, quests and greens. Had no epic item until raiding. 
---
A lot of people here just vomit out stuff people tell them without testing things or having first hand knowledge,
---
Because of weapon dependence, you are at the mercy of your drops. 2h are better for 20-47 because of the class quest, you also want tactical mastery if you are on a pvp server, but you'll still die without free action potions, ect, so don't weight that too much.
---
At, 50, av quest gives another 2h that'll carry you to max, but av won't be in at classic launch. The only other weapon from a quest is thrash blade from the mauradon quest, a 1h. So unless you plan on farming dungeons for specific drops, I'd take the mass of 1h quest rewards given after 46 and swap to fury from arms.
---
At 46 fury you get tac mastery in the arms tree so it's viable to win pvp skirmishes that are winnable, and fury is more flexible for switching to new weapons whereas arms relies on weapon specialization.
---
Another added benefit of fury that vomitters don't know is that in ungoro there is a raptor called venom hide ravasaur that when attacked applies a 9h weapon buff, the buff makes your weapon attack have a chance to apply a poison dot that deals 15dmg/3sec, stacks 3 times, and has separate stacks per weapon. Essentially ups your dps by 30 at 46 and because it lasts 9h its easy to keep up to 60. Fury is also easier for managing adds and multi targets because fast weapons let for easier target swaps and rage Gen. 
---
You'll miss more and have nasty miss strings, but 2h can get that too. If you're an orc or human then the bonus weapon skill offsets this. 
---
Ultimately, go with the weapons. I'd recommend 10-29 go 2h fury using the warrior class 1h till 18-20, then the deadmines staff/smites hammer if it drops, or the horde equiv from wc/Barrens, at 30 swap arms as you enter pvp zones and get the warrior class 2h, tacmastery for disarm and intercept is godly, then at 46 swap back fury and go with quest reward 1hers like from feral as unless you manage to get a nice 2h from zf or ulda, at 50 go back 2h fury with the av weap if available, or if you get a good 2h from Maura, otherwise just thrash blade it up, regardless of what you get from mauradon or av, it's enough to take you to 60,
---
I think you are over exaggerating the amount of people that will be min/maxing in Classic WoW. The majority will maybe go with the preferred class - race combo or talent tree, but they will not have issues with prot/ret paladins in dungeons, etc. Been mingling on p.servers, I have seen plenty of causal players that are cool with these things.
---
As other people have said, I used to do quests relating to stealing my light from Mu'ru in Silvermoon. And again as others have said that whole thing culminates in the sunwell. Ontop of that there's the redemption arc for blood elf paladins and how we find the real light, with Lady Liadrin in Shattrath after Velen uses Mu'ru's remains to reignite the sunwell, forever tieing Blood Knights to the story of Bloodeleves.
---
Then there's the charger quests that others have spoken of, which were amazing back in the day.
---
And finally it's been so long I can't remember where but there were parts of questing in Outland that refered to you as a bloodknight and dealt with things about blood knights all be it small.
---
In comparison, us Blood Knights received some stunning lore and quests to go with it. Back in the day anyway. 
---
If you wipe for 3 hours with a tank in the dungeon, that is rather on the players than the class. I had no issues healing or running dungeons with paladins on the p.server I play on. Follow the marks and wait 2 seconds for the pala to start. The only issues are the extra pulls from pats. But that is again on the players, not the class
---
&gt; Adding a barbershop NPC could create a ripple effect of unforeseen consequences
---
I didn't know William Zeppeli owned a barbershop.
---
Have done this with 6-14 fps and would gladly do it again. 
---
Not as my Ret. Only finished up too Scholomance. Mostly because TBC was released and we moved on. I think if TBC came out a few months later I would have. Keep in mind this was my alt, guild was fully geared we where killing time before TBC. 
---
Isn't the divide by two part wrong? In this way the total experience gets halved. If you only use the second formula, you already have a "divide by 2" when both players are on the same level. 
---
It's honestly a double edged sword. Guild Wars 2 handles expansions the way that you propose. Progression is strictly horizontal. The level cap is the same today (6 years and 2 expansions later) as it was at launch, ascended items (which would be like top tier item level WoW items) all have the same stat options regardless of how you get them (can be obtained from raids, crafting, pvp, or their procedural dungeon system.) 
---
Now this has the benefit of never cancelling your progressions. Legendary weapons in GW2 take forever to get. 100+ quest long chains, massive gold investment, and time gating. But once you get it, it's top-tier forever. Log in 3 years later and it's still best in slot. 
---
But the other side of the sword: once you've got the best gear, what's the point? They release a new expansion with new raids and tons of new content, but the end result will be items with the same stat options you've already had since the game launched. The gear grind is actually a huge motivating factor to come back and keep playing. Guild Wars is designed around the lack of a gear grind, WoW is not. It's not a 200 hour investment to get 1 piece of gear in WoW. You do a 2 hour raid and can walk out with 3 BiS pieces if you're lucky.
---
I put 1000 hours into GW2 and even to this day I feel like WoW was just so much more compelling thanks to the gear grind. Anybody who legitimately believes WoW should have been designed around that structure needs to play GW2 up to endgame. 
---
They will find themselves in darkshore at level 15 with only red quests in sight. Instead of traveling to other zones, they will try to do the quests repeatedly and quit after being unsuccessful.
---
I personally plan to tank my way to BiS gear for Warrior Pre-Raid and then if my guild required me to tank for then to pay the respec required... I just don't have the time to farm the life out of things! 
---
 I've already done it on Elys1um. Or better, i logged in, i played for 1-2 hours and when i saw it was impossible to experience the Core Gameplay Experience of Vanilla World of Warcraft (what i would supposedly be able to do) i logged off and came back the day after. Nothing fond about it.
---
Fun fact: people is all about having the more true experience possible but the clusterfuck launch is a private server thing because i doubt that on launch Wow had so many players.
---
Srsly, isn't real life hard enough to scavenge for a living? You have to dog pile for a Quillboar in wow too?
---
I have not played vanilla before and I am considering a mage due to farming. What kind of farm do you have in mind? Instances? 
---
It's true the class skills were functionally weaker, yes, such as AoE threat and threat generation itself being relatively low, but they did their job by necessity for the game to work.  Also, I acknowledge there are always going to be highly skilled players in any era of gaming, including every era (expansion) of WoW.
---
However, I stand by saying that the average skill level back then was much lower because the enemies in WoW have only gotten harder with each expansion (even if Wrath was a bit of a dip in difficulty), and yet even with more and more people joining WoW over time, I think everyone felt that more people than ever were still able to complete normal dungeons faster, do heroic dungeons at all, or even do raids either partially or completely.  Raids were made more accessible, even starting in TBC, but they were also harder than Classic (except for Classic Naxxramas and some parts of Temple of AQ).
---
Even if class skills got stronger or specs were just plain finally fixed, the enemies' abilities, the mechanics, still got harder over time.  And if some class skills let you ignore/heal through mechanics, then that's still more skilled than Classic because you have to remember to use them and sometimes properly.
---
Of course, if someone was to counter with stuff like the difficulty of non-Mythic/Challenge dungeons since Wrath and LFR (or Wrath Naxxramas), then no, of course you can't say those are harder than Classic's dungeons &amp; raids, but I would hope no one would take those seriously.
---
No amount of knowledge and is going to stop tentacles from one-shotting your clothies. Sure you might get lucky and never have a tentacle spawn in the stomach.
---
Quick question: how many bags did you find when leaving the starting zone (level 5). If you say more than 2 you are not playing on a blizzlike server...
---
I may be exaggerating; it's just that this sub has left a sour taste in my mouth when it comes to what to expect from the community. The moment anyone even mentions the word "ret" almost the entire sub explodes. Best example https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/abmzev/this_is_what_gonna_happen_if_you_try_to_raid_as/
---
They released tokens 3 months before the end of mop, WoD professions and boe system was developed around the token, professions had less BIS pre raid gear, so on and so forth. They didn’t just dump them in with no thought. 3 months before the end of mop they were handing out epics the market settled then an expansion designed with the token in mind was dropped. 
---
It seems like you think the convenience of a wow token out weighs the disadvantages of it. That’s fine you can think that, you’re likely wrong but let’s hope they don’t add tokens and I wont be proven right. :-)  
---
if you look at raid logs u can see feral can be beast dps until it starts dropping off pretty hard after bwl. 
---
but you were also probably using rip right? i dont think you can rip in a raid setting 
---
They already said they have no plans on balancing the game. Patch 1.12 is the "most balanced" point of pre-BC WoW and that is what they are going to run with.
---
spec the fury tree until lvl 40 then respec arms, use a 2h weapon all the way to 60.
---
God I hope not. Many additions through the games life cycles have been loved and hated or both. If you like Dual spec that's cool but it's an opinion. I hated it.
---
As far as Classic goes, I'm looking for a History snapshot. For it to be as it was.
---
When you are lvling a character in Vanillia WOW, it's take +- one week of /played.
---
So you gonna watch your character's back during one week at least.
---
If you prefer to watch a male during all this time it seems a bit weird to me :)
---
It will never be in classic. Just use your brain to figure out why, maybe play BFA.
---
At 10 seconds? That was only the intro bitch.
---
Looks better in general, though there are some exceptions (female Orcs and Dwarfs come to mind).
---
Classic doesn't sound like it is for you. Play something else or learn to appreciate the game for what it is. 
---
[egg_irl](https://imgur.com/pHgUZIq)
---
I just heard about the game around a year ago myself. Yeah I think the game has been in production for like 5 years now.
---
It's important to note that typically that's a very normal timeline for a game to be in development. The reason why most games don't seem to be in development for many years is because you never hear about them before they're already well into the timeline. By the time some trailer or news gets released to the public the game has already been in development for many years.
---
With Pantheon some of the stuff might have surfaced to the public a few years ago whereas most other game companies don't release info so soon.
---
For vanilla WoW I think the first footage emerged around 1999, which is around 5-6 years before the launch of the game.
---
Personally I would recommend looking into Pantheon and reading the FAQ about the game they have on their website for starters.
---
Brad McQuaid also wrote a really good article last year about his thoughts on WoW and the MMORPG industry in general, it's a really good read. You can find it on the Pantheon forums [here](https://www.pantheonmmo.com/content/blogs/151/180/want-went-wrong-wo-w-wo-w-killers-or-a-general-lack-of-guts).
---
They've also done plenty of public interviews and done streams of the game which you can find on YouTube, they usually give out plenty of info in those.
---
Gnomer is... I wouldn't say it's hard, because nothing in classic outside of pvp is actually difficult to do, but I do believe it's the low-level dungeons that has the most potential to go horribly wrong. It's somewhat labyrinthine, and you can fuck up the pulls pretty bad. Plus, if you do anything but a full clear, corpseruns start to get complicated.
---
This is so dumb it's probably true.
---
Most guilds in vanilla didnt use any form of raid logging addon. At best people used DPS meters. With the MUCH more prevalent logging today you'll see more scruteny regarding meme-specs.
---
Any serious progression guild that aim for BWL and beyond will probably not allow meme-specs.
---
Nightfall (and Annihilator) is to be carried by offtanks.
---
hes got 16 slot bags at lvl 45 plus his mount and all his skills.... not like any vanilla blizzard experience i ever heard of.
---
35-40 is the burnout check IMO.
---
If you get past that, you'll level to the end and then see if the game appeals enough at high level to make you stick around.
---
You mean just play badly? If any dps loses to the tank, it's more on player error/mismanagement than the spec. 
---
Maladath is one of the best OH swords prior to Naxx. 4 weapon skill is a HUGE boost in terms of DPS.
---
tldr: its great for tanks, fury warriors and rogues alike.
---
There is very little wrong with sharding at early levels if done properly.
---
It would in no way ruin the experience for anyone, and save time and frustrations for a LOT of people - either through log-in queues, or 100 people trying to kill the same 3 mobs in an area.
---
The biggest problem I see on this subreddit regarding sharding is that people don't actually know what it is.
---
In terms of raw defensive value, Quel'Serrar is the 2nd best tanking weapon in vanilla only beaten by TF.
---
In regards to threat though its good (for its lvl) but not great, beaten by BWL epics and onward.
---
And optimal geared tank for BWL-progress (without TF) would aim for Quel'serrar for their Def/survival-set and Maladath (or another DPS weapon) for their threat-set.
---
I agree with your post. I've also participated and involunarily organized a few RP PvP Campaigns in my time and usually the Horde did win them on my server, despite the Alliance outnumbering the Horde atleas 3:1.
---
The usual drama ensued as you mentionend. Both sides bitched on the realmforums constantly and especially on the Allaince side, there a lot of Rp tourists. People who played characters that never really participated in Rp PvP and were not really ready to lose their characters while the Horde chewed through guilds in a plot constantly.
---
Despite the bias from most organizers towards the alliance, most players had good fun and the battles were rather rare while the smaller skirmirshers and camp roleplaye dominated. I think that was good fun.
---
How so? You do t like full cities? 
---
Everyone that plays memespecs represent a group of people that play that.   
---
You just fucked up ret pally to someone, and you want to be proud of it? You are not a victim, the victim are the other ret pallies that actually play the game well.
---
I don't understand this. Didn't they have PTR realms then? I assume that nobody downed C'thun during the beta. Did they consider nobody being able to beat a raid during the beta period, not even the developers, "normal"?
---
Why isn't this sticky?
---
It’s a mild form of transvestitism that I endulge in from time to time
---
Dualwield, 2h fury and Arms are all viable lvling specs without major differences other than utility talents and playstyle.
---
That being said, I wouldnt recommend Dualwield before lvl45 (when you get thrashblade from Maraudo quest). This sword is basically pre-raid-bis-equal so it will last you from lvl45 to early raiding even.
---
I can relate to that. This is the reason I'm visiting this sub less and less by each day. All it needs is one good guild on the server and screw the rest
---
In 2005, I bought wow, went home and picked my class while reading the manual in the toilets. Ended up leveling as a resto druid and raiding as feral.
---
Different times.
---
Lmao if you’re looking at the backside of your male character instead of the outlying world, it speaks volumes 
---
The "looking at the characters ass" is bullshit, admit it.  
---
I saw a survey at the GW2 subreddit a few months ago and players who like to play *with* their character, prefer a female and the ones who play *as* they character, prefer male.
---
Whatever the reason is, people shouldn't feel ashamed to play whatever they want then cover up with excuses.
---
When does warrior 2hand fall off?
---
Indulge*
---
Not really. A ret in pre-raid BiS would easily out DPS the tank. Won't be top 15 DPS, but won't be below the tank.
---
My god, what a difference it is without 90% of players 1000 ft in the sky. So much better.
---
I had Nokia 3510i in when I started playing. It had gprs and Java ME support. 
---
Lmao, I wanted to post something similar to your reply.
---
Most of the players are Human yet not all roll Human. It's an RPG, people Roleplay. 
---
Well, i would not worry to much in a 40 man group, unless he was out-dpsed by the AFKs as well?
---
Imagine being this insecure 
---
It was true in vanilla, and it was/is also true (although to a lesser extent) on private servers.
---
15 years of pre-knowledge as well as experience has made Cthun easier (but still really hard/impossible for the average guild).
---
that's not my experience. Maybe you're playing on a shitty pserver? On the one I'm playing everyone is friendly and patient.
---
My main reason: I prefer the fightning animations.
---
Also: In vanilla they had different sizes for hitboxes between races (maybe sexes too). That being said, I dont know if this will be the case in classic. How is it in BFA?
---
I honestly like that raid drops can be applied in dungeons to great extent and not all give you a flat out bonus for raiding further tiers.
---
Warriors notoriously low on +thorns damage will take Essence of Pure Flame any day of week for dungeon tanking. 
---
Stratholme undead packs come to mind in which I used Wyrmthalaks Heart of the Scale without miss.
---
I only wish Blizzard took the RP servers a bit more seriously and punished those that go on them specifically to cause trouble. Generally, I don't mind if people spam their dumb memes in general chat or even if they're griefing everyone else - you can turn off the chat, and, well, griefing is a part of the game. But when you see some guy that just made an alt on an RP server intentionally to fuck with the way people decided to play the game, it's disheartening. 
---
Blizzard needs to understand that we; The fans will be absolutely MERCYLESS and show no quarter if they fuk this up.
---
We will not accept half-assed-games and we will not accept QoL-changes for cater to the casual crowd.
---
I wonder if auction-style would solve that.
---
Indeed, might even be better to level as tank as well - might not be blindingly fast but you can pull a lot more mobs anyway and a lot of quests are kill X of those, or collect Y items from killing npcs. 
---
Grouping up with others is good as well - any DPS or healer in particular would want to group with a tank to level/quest.
---
&gt;tricky
---
sticky
---
The only actual reason I can imagine (besides actually being transsexual) is that some of the female models and animations look better than their male counterpart. Human females had the bets animations and model in Classic imo.
---
Still gonna play a male.
---
Keep in mind that rogue is a very gear dependent class. The better your gear the easier time you will have and the faster you will level/perform until late game raid gear. Blacksmithing or Leatherworking really does help rogues in this respect. 
---
Boobs and asses to look at. Remember in vanilla most players were quite a bit younger and overflowing with hormones.
---
Basically as soon as you start getting raid tier drops like onyxia weapons. But say your raid has 12 warriors/rogues to gear up that's 24 weapons. It takes a long time to get that many weapons so it's better to use the few 2h weapon drops on warriors so you have less melles using 5 man dungeon swords. 
---
Rather stare at a chick for a few hours a day instead of a dude XD. Also I enjoy some of the cast/attack animations more and I feel it helps you stand out a bit more in your server. You know there are 1,000 orc male shamans that all look the same
---
Yup this. Got Alliance the only race I'd choose male on wouldnbe Dwarf. The rest female. For Horde I'd choose mostly male with it depending on caster or melee for some races, such as troll. Female troll animations are a bit meh for a hunter and melee but decent as male, but they're alright for a healer/caster. 
---
that was one of my thoughts to maybe go skinning + leathercrafting and maybe go from skinning to engineering later at lvl 60. but does leathercrafting + engineering on lvl 60 make sense? or do i need a gathering profession 100%?
---
Is Naxx easier than C'thun?
---
I grew up playing classic, I just also realize where its strengthe lie and I'm not so nostalgic that I'm willing to overlook the flaws that were later corrected 
---
No thanks, I quit years ago and the only thing even tempting me to play WoW again is the thought of returning to Vanilla 
---
That's cool, was curious how that was going to work 
---
You're telling me you've never been in a serious relationship with your character?
---
This!
---
40-60 takes about as much time as 1-40
---
Some bosses in Naxx are definitely less complex than cthun.
---
Oof yeah gearing BiS for two specs was tough. Still, easily one of my favorite little quality of life updates that came along. Loved Enhance, but Resto was life. 
---
Fixing the bugs was the nerf.
---
Avoiding a mechanic which is meant to limit the positioning and dps is kinda playing against the design. It’s not exploding. But let’s be honest method did the same with rogues vs avatar.
---
It still should be fixed 
---
I want my character to look best so I will choose whatever gender of the race fits best. Usually I prefer smaller models to bigger ones with an exception to Tauren because their female look so hideous.
---
When I create a character i don’t pretend this is me or the representation of my my physical self ingame. To me it’s just a tool to enjoy the game which I want to look best possible (and to which I’ll still feel connected).
---
The other way around I think it’s a bit wierd when people project their self so much in their character that they can’t comprehend why everyone else wouldn’t do the same.
---
Maybe the tank is total boss
---
I see. You mentioned raiding, and while you could bring large numbers to small instances typically raiding refers to 20/40 man content. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
Isn't Ele a worse DPS spec than Enhancement on everything but trash due to mana issues?
---
No. Vanilla is vanilla, so no different route in anything... Sadly Activision is doing some changes to infrastructure, UI, report models and other things. But I don't see them touching anything in items or classes. Which is a good thing imo.
---
I'm pretty sure they declared already that balancing wont be touched at all. Don't have source tho or time to dig up right now.
---
Thanks, i'll look it up once i get home :)
---
Ppl consider a character themselfs, its something on the screen that takes actions. so why wouldnt you be female, it looks nicer in many cases.
---
who is real wierdos are ppl, that only play their gender and take it all too seriously.
---
Wow Classic isn't tying to be the next smash-hit game. It's just trying to exist. With the good and the bad. 
---
Because it is a RPG and the whole point of that is to play a role regardless of what they are irl. 
---
Are you going to bash on people who don’t play as a human “considering they are human irl”?
---
Login queue.
---
Becuase it was out first time and AutoModerator failed us. 
---
When companies resurrect and remaster old games, the whole point is to typically bring that game back how it was back then. If they start to put in effort to re-balance the whole game then that makes it a completely new game and defeats the purpose of resurrecting it in the first place, just make a brand new game from scratch at that point.
---
Yes, Blizzard already said they want to go with patch 1.12 - which to many people is a let down. I would prefer if they started from patch 1.1 and went through all of the changes that happened in vanilla, but they already said they won't and for me that's not a deal breaker.
---
But if they start re-balancing stuff from scratch and introducing changes that never happened in vanilla then that is a deal breaker for many people, because those changes never happened in vanilla.
---
I don't think anyone is against changes that actually happened from  1.1 to 1.12, that's completely fine which Blizzard has also said is their stance on it.
---
&gt;part of the community that loves classic but wants all classes/specs viable for raiding/pvp, QoL
---
I mean... they did that... they have been doing it for 10 years. 
---
People really don't understand design. You can't have lines be perpendicular and parallel at the same time. The second you normalize all classes and specs is the second classes and specs lose personality. The more you bring in QoL changes, the less players need to interact to overcome the challenges of the game.
---
Retail is retail because blizzard are not designing a game, they are designing solutions to player exit survey complaints.
---
You don't need to have a gathering profession, but it will be more costly without one. If you are happy with grinding for gold rather than materials then you can do it. It's really just depends on your playstyle. When I used to play Vanilla, I had engineering + enchanting. It was very expensive to maintain and I had to grind and sell cloth to make enough to buy other materials.
---
&gt;"I've always played a hunter but I will rerole in classic... because of having to feed my pet and store arrows. Those mechanics deserved to be removed from the game" - 100 upvotes
---
There's two tings I hate in MMOS: fucking carebears and devs who cater to carebears.
---
Pre-nerf, but with the bugs that made it actually unkillable fixed. Let gods be gods.
---
the thing i am scared the most of is that blizzard might listen to that kind people. like ... i am really fucking scared
---
Well it's rude of blizzard to create a dps spec that does no dps. 
---
So in your opionion Naxx is the only raid in Van? 
---
Meh, you’re just going to be gimping yourself. You can simply turn your pet on passive and pay him no mind if it really bothers you having one. I would recommend instead though that you just bind mousewheel up to pet attack, and mousewheel down to pet follow. A brainless, simple way to control your pet
---
&gt; listening part of the community that loves classic but wants all classes/specs viable for raiding/pvp, QoL, Events, and anything else that the classic community can potentially "Vote" on that will keep the game fresh 
---
I can't see any difference from retail here tbh.
---
I play enhance. I'm used to this. LUL
---
There's nothing wrong with playing a meme spec. However it's your fault for not coming prepared, because if played right every spec can out dps tanks, except maybe you freshly dinged 60. But then you shouldn't attend a raid, especially a PUG in the first place.
---
If people don't like ret paladin, they should not play ret paladin. Nobody is foricing them to. That's it.
---
&gt;First of all you dont get to decide what is and what isnt Vanilla. These esoteric details seemed to be plenty popular on private servers. 
---
But you do?
---
I love that logic where, people that play ret back then were stupid, and people that played pure dps were always godlike players. And that in Classic it will be the same.
---
I mained ret in 40 mans, and mostly tanked in most of non 40 man content. I did a lot of AQ40, and guild used a dps meter, and it was fine because not everyone played perfectly. And it will be fine in Classic as well because non pservers people will not play perfect. Because that was and will not be the point. Yes we won't be 1st or even 10th of server, but we don't care and you don't need pserver type of raid DPS to clear content. Private servers did really bury you ability to see and accept anything else than minmax results.
---
A good hunter is seen through the way he handles his pet. In 5 man it can save a wipe or couse a wipe. In raid you can buff your melees with furious howl buff and add extra damage, if done properly you'll be the best hunter in game if every other hunter knows the rotation and have same gear. For leveling it works as a tank, you barely take damage and you can easily kill two mobs at the same time and you're also able to fight in closer areas. Without you 'll need to kite. Having a pet increases your leveling speed tremendously. I recently tried leveling as a survival hunter with one of the worst pets and in all honesty, never again. Get a boar or a cat or owl go bm/mm and you'll be a leveling God. No pet and you're worse then a warrior.
---
Cool. Ignore lists exist for a reason. If you don't like how I'm playing, just ignore me and move on? Go play with other people. Not rocket science. Don't be a little bitch and send triggered whispers about it.
---
I was talking about those who don't want it their party because they bring less to the table than other classes.
---
I personally enjoy the ret paladin flavour, but I won't play it in raids if this makes other people angry.
---
Plenty of ways to farm a lot of gold with holy! 
---
what did you do to farm gold? if i remember correctly, most of the time the best way to farm gold was to farm with mining or herbalism. or other gathering professions. how was it in classic. what was a good / best way to farm gold?
---
You will cry without pet.
---
That is just private servers... At release the game had like 100.000 players in total spread out in the servers. The cluster fuck with 1000+ players in a starting area has nothing to do with vanilla
---
Oh hey, it's the 1,000 "What if Classic was like OSRS?" post.
---
WoW is 14 years old. Maybe you should inform yourself what the class you play is capable of beforehand. It's not like a surprise prot pallys will never be a main tank.

---
This is my reference, do you have a better retail source?
---
Stupid comment...
---
They explained it and it sounds reasonable to me. They never intended to go backwards, so why should they've been prepared for it.
---
That's the problem of community, not the game. Blizzard should not be fixing something which players themselves are breaking.
---
But i really don't think that ret paladin can't find a raid spot in a non-hardcore guild.
---
There's nothing wrong with TBC.
---
It's flying mounts and LFG/LFR that killed wow.
---
Blizzard are ones making these changes.
---
Blizzard is not some kind of holy deity that can do no evil and Activision isn't a scapegoat.
---
I do agree that there should be skepticism when it comes to Activision. However, Blizzard still does have some freedom when it comes to the decision of options.
---
And Blizzard knows that the only way for Classic to be successful IS to please the community. Some compromises need to be made for sure but all in all it needs to be the way we want to. Thus they WILL HAVE TO deliver. Fear and skepticism aside, if they don't, we'll all go back to private servers. They'll never win the legal fight against those.
---
Yeah but if you get past 40, most people are past the burnout stage.
---
Either they've burned out, or not.
---
(is what I meant)
---
I realize fully that that is a normal timeline for a game, so I'm not saying it as a bad thing, it's just that it's hard for me to, as a fan, keep tabs on a game for several years and keep the interest up. Will 100% be trying it out when it drops though.
---
Also found out about their streams yesterday. Will definitely keep it running in the background when I work to catch up!
---
Frost Mage Vs any Melee.
---
Otherwise Warlock, then Shadow Priest.
---
Chill, dude. I have no problem with ppl being female, I just want insight into why they actually want it.
---
Too soon
---
Right sry
---
It's the other way around.
---
As much as some individuals might like to play as ret, the community in general is forcing pallies to play as holy.
---
Ret pallies are basically a wasted raid slot.
---
Not at all. Rogues are good at ganking sure, but a proper fight between two classes rogue is nowhere near the top.
---
but there are also pet abilities (or can they all be set to autocast?), feeding the pet... *shudders*
---
Yeah, Activision includes blizzard for me. If blizzard does some changes is because the cost allows it to. I think the developers of classic have a budget that Activision controls and they need to work within that. So in essence Activision is controlling blizzard
---
IIRC, they didn't ptr c'thun in order to avoid spoilers around the new content. And when they use developers to tune content, they assume that a raid group will perform better than a Dev team. So when they feel the mechanics are stable, then they buff it for release. I've always assumed that the main problem with the small tentacles was a combination of being over tuned and bugged spawns. 
---
Hopefully 
---
How's the damage output without a pet, though? How much damage does the pet add? Is it 30%? 50%? More, less?
---
Who you think gonna play Classic..?
---
Look at the thread, its pretty clear that ”play meme-spec” isnt very welcome. 
---
It's really sad that such a thread is upvoted that much.
---
I can remember many raids when a warrior/rogue/mage was behind the tank. Everyone can be bad at the game and screw up everything. It's not because you played an offspec back then that you were badly skilled. On equal skill and gear with the raid, offspecs will do fine damage so that they are not carried by only doing like 50% of the damage. That's what every play should look at. 
---
You claim to like the community aspect of wow, but having more than 3 dps spec was totally part of it, and many guilds cleared even AQ40 that way. By shitting on some specs and giving such wrong examples, you are really showing players that Classic will have an undesirable number of intolerant, dry, and toxic players that will only think about min maxing. To the point people will even leave 5 mans groups where there are offspec.
---
Pathetic, really.
---
Of cause this is about sharding. Mass server launches are well known to be a ps thing. However, classic never had the expected turist influx and die-off either. It’s an eight-legged mennace!
---
Pretty sure you can autocast that stuff. Without a pet leveling is gonna be brutal. You could maybe get two shots off before you need to melee Mona to death or wing clip kite each and every one. Would not recommend
---
Maybe it comes in the cash shop. 
---
Huh? You say you raided as ret but only did Scholo? Scholo isnt viewed as a raid. 
---
Same for mage/war/rogue bad players though. Right?
---
As I said, I made a killing farming and selling cloth as most people want to level first aid. Also, fishing and cooking can bring in good gold too, as their buffs are beneficial in raids. Otherwise, you grind certain mobs that drop materials for professions. I know a lot of people killed fire and stone elemental for various materials to put on the auction house.
---
Ah "I play for fun".. those players gave me headaches so many times. It's the standard phrase of any raid leaders girlfriend who comes along. I play for fun.. but I also try to understand and master my class/spec. :P
---
I hadn't thought about this at all but I see my characters as their own people. Even when friends and I have discussed the game I refer to each toon by name as though they are people whereas some of the others us 'the priest' or 'my mage'. 
---
It could be a perspective thing or I may just be odd.
---
in your reference it even says seal of command is melee hit.. haha did u even read ur own reference? 
---
Yeah but most of pservers players apparently think that way.
---
Weirdly enough I always play male characters, except for Orcs and Dwarves. I almost always go female with Orcs or Dwarves.   
---
I'd say the ugliest and probably rarest female race would be Tauren, I barely ever see one.  
---
I'd like to see it pre-fix only because it's been debated for 10 years now and will keep being talked about as long as wow is a thing. Although, if he's killed, then there will be a new debate about whether classic wow is really the same as it was, but that will probably happen regardless. 
---
That was not mine. But hey, we all had different experience! Like it's expected in a mmo.
---
Ooh ALOT less in raiding, it depends how good you know the bosses and how good you can control your pet. I've seen numbers of 5% increase but that is high I'd say. Expect something like 1-2%. But for dungeons it can be much more, like 30-40% if you're bm
---
Up too, did everything but Naxx
---
Faps 
---
People always talk about how they "nerfed" C'Thun so I assume they tuned it down, not that the spawn of certain mobs was buggy. But people like to talk, so...
---
Vanilla =|= Dual spec
---
Because all the males on horde except for tauren have scoliosis.
---
So rogues/mages that end below other dps classes may not take loot either?
---
Nice :)
---
The dream raiding guild I am hoping to join will have one ret pala and one moonkin/oomkin, but no shadowpriest, as a meme spec statement. It will also have a holy weaver and one feral tank who can also cat and decurse. One hunter will be able to double as a melee hunter. One soul link lock and one tank who is arms/prot rather than fury/prot. One prot pala healing also.
---
But: They are all expected to tryhard. This is true diversity and it’s what I want. Ftr I will play as a mage. 
---
Also didn't do Ahn'Qiraj on that too. Sorry for the misunderstanding. 
---
Everyone was cool with it back then. My several guilds, even top server guild like a professional well known french team wow section. They had a ret pal, always godly geared. I know he wasn't healing.
---
Those who won't be cool with it many players, offspec or not, know they will avoid guilding with them. And everyone is happy.
---
&gt; Vanilla is not about the esoteric details of the limitations of each and every class. Its a design ethos that permeated through the entire game. That's vanilla.
---
Now you're getting into some really abstract shit, that's not typically how things are defined.
---
When people talk about Super Mario 64 they talk about the game that was made for Nintendo and released in 1996.
---
When people talk about anything there's a clear definition for that subject.
---
If you start to define things your way then you can basically escape any definition which doesn't help anything at all, in that case how do you define any topic?
---
It's not like you can say "Rock &amp; Roll isn't a strictly defined genre of music, it's a mindset" - nope, it has a very clear definition of what it is and what rules it's based on.
---
Objectively speaking vanilla WoW is the game that took place between patches 1.1 and 1.12, anything after that isn't vanilla WoW anymore. After that you go into TBC, then you go into the next expansion etc.
---
You can very easily define what vanilla WoW is and what the actual tangible game is without going into some abstract rhetoric. That's the game Blizzard is releasing and marketing.
---
Of cause, I’d hope so
---
Human - if you heal you will wear robes. male humans look shit in robes
---
orc - male shoulderpads are craaaazy large, i love the large shoulders but i can understand why some prefer females
---
troll - female dance is BIS
---
undead - if you are rogue your "kick" spell is a backflip...  enough said
---
Nelf - male casting animations are worst in slot
---
I'm sure the other races have their reasons as well. Aesthetics man - just let people like what they like
---
I started just after the launch of WoW, so missed the main wave of people. However I did get stuck in the wave of people who started late or rerolled a different class. It was a cluster-fu*ck of people fighting for quests and mobs. It was hard to play and time consuming as a result. BUT, perseverance and breaking away from that, advancing forward was one of the best feelings I ever had in the game. I still remember the day I breached out into the wilds. Through all the commotion, it was well worth it. (However I do understand the argument for sharing in the first 2 areas....as long as that's it and only for a few weeks).
---
He can’t because that takes skill, which being out-dpsd by the tank proves, that he does not have. 
---
No, dont level as prot. Its insanely bad. 
---
Except he was a fury tank;)
---
I feel your comment is a bit conflicted. "Play the way you want and dont be ashamed" "except this one particular reason for playing that way, that one reason is bullshit"
---
u/SangerNegru
---
Are you saying hunter melee skills and dmg output are not good enough to kill mobs quickly?
---
Exactly. But you know, pserver players have been playing the same version for 14 years. So their version is the true one right?
---
That's the reason comments like yours, though absolutely true, won't be heared in a sub like this. Most Classic players won't be ex pservers players, but most posters in this sub are.
---
we could, but that doesn't give nearly as much karma
---
always wondered about that...how do you zoom-in/out then? I find myself zooming in and out all the time to adjust my character view. Using scrollwheel for that is so naturally. 
---
I bound scrollwheel button to the left and to the right to send/return my pet (which my mouse supports)
---
Good luck man

" I'd be pissed if I was min/maxing and someone else in my raid wasn't. " We call this hard core raiding and there are guilds and places for you to do this. Honestly unless you end up in some top guild in the world i HIGHLY doubt you are going to find a classic guild with 39 other people min/maxing to their true potential. If you somehow need 40 people all in 100% bis gear, absolute perfect rotation and perfect specs to clear vanilla raids I am sorry to tell you but you're probably a bad player. 
---
I almost never adjust my camera, so I just bind it to up/down arrow key Incase I need to adjust it once in a blue moon
---
Exactly. Vanilla was a game that has evolved during 2 years, where class balanced changed every patch. This was Vanilla. And hopefully it will be the same.
---
“More people” isn’t “everyone.” And that’s not the point. “What if everyone did it” isn’t a valid argument here because “everyone” picking one spec is bad, whether it’s healer, tank, or DPS. 
---
So, once we get past the failed attempt at a reductio ad absurdum, we’re back to the point that the boss died, the raid didn’t kick him, and the attempts to min-max everything wouldn’t have meaningfully changed anything here. 
---
Over populated servers are terrible experience.  I quit nost cause of it and now on NorthD if pop is 7k+ I just log and play another game. 
---
Essence of pure flame is great for whelp room on warrior tanks, combined with thorns, shield spike, etc
---
Have fun getting ganked in full world buffs on your way to the raid. 
---
Usually meme speccd bad players are more common than meme speccd good players. 
---
absolutely, a 200 dps rogue shouldn't be taking gear from a rogue who is putting in far more effort, if someone is playing that poorly they shouldnt be invited to raid night tell they pull their own weight.
---
You have to realize that most of these people who have the "knowledge" and details on min maxing and gearing are people who have played extensively on private servers and maybe cleared Naxxramas multiple times.
---
Most of the people who are interested in rolling these specs aren't a part of those people, and in reality most people are just doing them a huge favor by telling them not to roll one of those specs because what most likely ends up happening is that someone who hasn't played the game in a decade spends 2-3 months leveling to 60 only to end up quitting the game.
---
Its not the devs who are greedy. It’s the publishers!!!
---
Are you saying we can't stay in the starting zone killing boars? 
---
This right here is speaking the truth. This shit happens in modern WoW too. People try forming a raid group with some kind of holy grail of raid comps. I understand that Warriors and occasionally Feral druids are really the only viable raid tanks in vanilla, there is really no getting around this. However as you pointed out with DPS it pretty much comes down to the player. 
---
Chances are in 40 man raiding you don't have an entire set of DPS players that are all playing far above average. Unless you are a high end guild that can attract high end players chances are most of your dps players are at or slightly below/above average. 
---
Also the fact that even after so much has been found in favor of Feral druid dps that they are still called a "meme spec" is kind of sad. From what I understand at this point as long as they put in the effort to get a few items they are very viable DPS.
---
See, this is NOT the way you go about playing a meme spec. If you want to be taken seriously and not be thought of as a joke and a waste of time. You should do what Esfand does, work your **ass** off to do good DPS, carry 5x more mana potions and water than your contemporaries. Get as many world buffs as possible, along with the best flasks and elixirs. 
---
Fight every trash pack as if you were fighting a raid boss, then drink after every single pull. Seriously, at least 70% of your time in a dungeon or raid should be spent drinking.
---
Only then will people start to see you as something other than a meme spec and will actually respect you for playing a meme spec.
---
Don't be that "I play what I like so stfu" guy, be the very best you can be instead.
---
Exactly! This is the main issue.
---
Shadow priest, for example, could arguably be fixed in pve by letting mind flay scale properly with gear, or by lowering the mana cost of mind blast, but this would make them even more unstopablenin pvp.
---
One option could be a talents like this: 
---
- Improved Mind Flay: Increases the spell damage coeff. but reduces the slow effect of mind flay.
---
- IMPROVED Improved Mind Blast: Mind blast has a 10% chance when hitting a target to proc spirit tap and deal 50% additional damage to the priest.
---
Such talens would be quite bad for pvp I would say, but totally helps in pve. 
---
The voices are less annoying. Other than Tauren, I like the /silly better. I play Horde and, again, other than Tauren the males are all hunched over. So I play females except for Taurens. 
---
nice to hear. thanks for explaining :)
---
underrated comment for sure
---
Paladins are tier 2 tanks, shamans are tier 3. Check out Meldero’ns tanking guide on youtube. 
---
Speak for yourself. I'm a mystical elf man who can turn into a bear.
---
Bliz credited 6 days over the first month, so it was pretty bad. 
---
Vanilla day one had 100k users on by the evening of that day. Classic could be 20x that. 
---
The people who really enjoyed not being be able play Vanilla at launch are few and far between because most of the “but my community” people weren’t really there for the launch of Vanilla and of those who were, I don’t remember a single person who loved the queues, crashes, restarts, loot lag, or anything of the sort. 
---
I plan to focus mainly on PvP where I can tbh. So if my guild would like me to tank then I feel it's a fair deal for them to pay right :P
---
great trinket for grinding too for paladins
---
wasn't expecting the Sticky Keys meme, but so so so true
---
**Summary: Dual wielding auto attack DPS is roughly equal, and usually slightly superior, to 2h DPS when comparing equal level rare quality weapons. Dual wield is much better for heroic strike and overpower, but much worse for slam and whirlwind. Supporting math follows.**
---
Assumption: You have enough attack power that AP/14 is roughly equal to 1h rare weapon DPS. More AP than that favors dual wielding. This is easily achieved while leveling and does not require good gear. Just for example right now on my 60 warrior when I take off all gear and apply battle shout I get 41 dps from AP, while pre raid BiS 1h weapons have 41.4 dps.
---
While leveling an equal level rare 2h will always have roughly 1.3x the weapon DPS of a rare 1h.
---
Green 1h weapons have roughly 3 to 4 dps less than rare ones no matter what level they are. So at level 20ish a rare weapon is about 30% better, while by the time the player is 50ish it is only 10% better. 2h follow a similar pattern.
---
Mob parry chance = 5%, dodge chance = 5%, chance to be missed with 2h = 5%, chance to be missed with dual wield = 24%
---
Thus 2h hits mob 85% of the time and dual wield hits 66% of the time.
---
Without dual wield specialization an off hand weapon does 50% damage of main hand.
---
From raw weapon dps:
---
Let 1h blue weapon dps be = 1
---
Thus 2h blue weapon dps = 1.3
---
And offhand blue weapon dps = 0.5
---
AP contribution to weapon DPS = 1 as assumed earlier, with offhand getting half value. Thus after adjusting for AP:
---
Dual Wield dps = 3
---
2h dps = 2.3
---
And finally accounting for hit rate gives us the true comparison:
---
Dual Wield DPS = 1.98
---
2h DPS = 1.96
---
**Special Abilities**
---
Special abilities are not affected by the additional 19% dual wield miss rate. 
---
Heroic strike is a special ability. Thus whenever a dual wielder uses heroic strike he is converting an attack that had a 66% chance to hit into a 85% chance to hit. Whenever he uses heroic strike he is losing that weapon's rage generation for the next swing, which inherently favors dual wielding and also favors faster main hand weapon speeds.
---
Overpower can be used whenever you are dodged. When dual wielding your 50% damage offhand is often dodged, allowing you to convert it into a more powerful main hand overpower attack. A player will always get more benefit out of overpower while dual wielding. Overpower favors wielding a slow weapon in main hand and a fast one in offhand.
---
Slam and Whirlwind does much better with a 2h, and favors a slow weapon. In vanilla Whirlwind doesn't include off hand weapon damage.
---
Removed, please move to our weekly [stickied](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/abrw9s/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_january_02_2019/) thread. 
---
I did AQ40 and early Naxx (Spider wing, and maybe a coulple of others, hard to remember exactly) as Ret, but this was my alt and I was joining people that were lesser progressed than my main was.
---
Paladins were originally created to have a Crusader strike ability, but it was overtuned. So when the game released, they removed it completely and didn't give paladins anything as compensation for removing it.
---
better than classic at least thats for sure
---
Yes. They're not.
---
can confirm, because clicking shadow bolt every 2.5s is damn hard
---
Except that over time other strategies have developed that might not have been accounted for. Things like stacking classes, engineers, FB, how consumes and world buffs are done. Debuff priorities. It is not uncomon to see debuffs on old vids that just wouldnt be used these days.
---
I did not check the math but I do assume the variables over time changed and the possebility of someone making a mistake.
---
It's hard to value. A proper feral (to say it's the same for others than ret) may stay decursing the whole fight and, as such his damage will be awful. That is skill-less?
---
Utility isn't as easy to value as a raw dps number. 
---
The worst feeling is when it's so obvious someone is getting carried and on top of that they have a shot at getting gear. If that guy actually won an item over me as a Warrior for example I'd probably think about quitting.
---
It's just a giant fuck you to anybody else to play those specs in a raid, you're making others carry your ass just so you can have your own "fun" - it's super selfish.
---
Yeah, that's my guess too.
---
Addon idea.
---
Addon records the time taken to kill mob.
---
Addon records the level and xp gain.
---
Addon then spits out what level is best to kill for most efficient xp per hour (or minute).
---
I know addons similar to this exist, but they only go so deep as to tell you your xp per hour as a whole and not which level is best to kill.
---
Can we gain access to this sheet?!?!
---
Or can we get access to the google docs sheet?
---
This.  There's always going to be that one geared resto druid who goes moonkin for laughs in farm content and does surprisingly well, but to offset this there are 15 moonkin lifers who \*only\* play a shit spec and use the "its just a game bro, relax" argument as a shield for their low performance.
---
These specs aren't bad because people don't understand the intricacies of pressing Seal and then Judgement every 10 seconds, it's because a decade of math proved that they can't compete even with the best possible gear.
---
Substitute ret/feral/enhance/shadow/etc
---
My only experience of Naxx40 was in TBC at lvl70 so I cant talk of actual retail experience. I have however cleared both raids on private servers and I would rank only Kel'Thuzad and 4hm as harder than C'thun with Sapphiron coming in as 4th. The other 12 bosses in Naxx ranges from very easy to quite challenging.
---
you'd be awful in pvp, utterly horrific at leveling and lose a lot in raids/dungeons. Don't even slightly consider playing hunter if you never wanna use the pet.
---
For gender I usually choose whatever is more aesthetically pleasing.  So in WoW I played male dwarf hunter and male undead priest.  In quite a few other games (Vindictus, Tera, single player RPGs) I play female because well ... they look way better(or in Vindictus gender-locked).  If I played human priest I would also go female.  Might be sexist actually since my decision process I think is actually -How does female char look?  If Good -&gt;Female If Bad -&gt; Male.  
---
Exactly what i am saying
---
If you are to be a burden just because  you want to have 'fun' better go play something else.
---
In a raid regardless how easy or hard it is everyone gotta carry their own weight.
---
No rips, just fbit, fury and shred. Meant to not use fury
---
yes, or at least at a lower prio tha people who have their shit together 
---
Don't bash on his waifu, his neck beard will get angry!
---
That's true
---
[Gnome with Asscandy is amazing.](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/123519.jpg)
---
Indeed. 
---
Some classes have it too easy due to tier sets being suitable for other uses. Locks get rather easily good PvP gear (T2 is great for it) if raiding.  Same for any other pure dps but mage (can't say much about them, mage mains enlighten us). Non-armor pieces (i.e. jewellery, trinkets) for these are usually the same for raiding or profession-based (hi engineering). Weapons are usually not an issue either (warlocks may favor 1H+OH due to spellstone but a staff is still fine, rogues are fine, hunters' melee ones might find some issues but still... ranged are exclusive for them).
---
Compare this to any hybrid. 
---
This is great, thanks for the sticky.

Bone apple tea, sir

I played on launch day.  I was in queue for a few hours.  After I got in there were quite a few people at the initial starting area(dwarf/gnome area) but you could still get stuff done in a fairly timely manner just not optimal.  After I left that area at the level 4-5ish? mark I basically didnt have anymore problems with overcrowding.  At most there would be a 2-3 other people doing the same quest and often times we would group up to do them.  I don't really remember any chokepoints besides maybe in Loch Modan with a clicky thing which took a while(like 15-20 mins while doing other stuff).  Overall the experience of launch wasn't bad for me but I had guildies who got into the queue late and the system stalled because people were not logging off.  Basically they were not able to get on until after the server kicked everyone off.  That is one of the main problems with a queue system is that people just avoid logging out.
---
Keep in mind I was most likely a bit ahead of the main rush as but not blazing speed either.  I think I remember being in my 40s when there was our server first 60.  Good ole Bootstrap.
---
Similarly I rerolled on 2 other vanilla server launches (one as undead and 2nd one as dwarf again) and again there were no problems at all for those.  High population and a lot of people around but almost no content was choked and there were no queues for those server launches.
---
Could you PM the details, I’m EU and Alliance. PvP worries me though!
---
still looks better than the usual ugly exalted/guardian saint robes for healers
---
&gt; What exactly is token level prices?
---
I used to play EVE that implemented token system way sooner. There were some relative rare items you couldn't manufacture en masse (recipe was rare and only for a limited run). Now these items price went up after the token price went up. Other items maybe get a bit pricey but they were still tied to the resources which they were made from.
---
I expect the same price increase if a good amount of server population farms every month not just for their consumables but for the token as well.
---
&gt;  How much are they gonna sell for?
---
This is basic economics 101. If you have lots of buyers and couple of sellers, then they get a high price. Lots of sellers and only a couple buyers - low price.
---
But for me the important part is volume. High volume means lots of gold in the economy that fuels the inflation like crazy.
---
Now you can ask how many percentage of the population needs to farm month by month for token to start this inflation... I dont know, but I suspect its a low number (~20%). 
---
&gt; if only a couple people were willing to risk their account to buy gold than blizzard would’ve never implemented the token system. There was/still is a demand for gold sellers in retail.
---
Well 2-3% of the server population still a shit tone of ppl and money they can made. But I'm pretty sure if its legal you see 10-20 percent of the player base buying tokens.
---
I find these comments really great, because we arguing about numbers we don't really know.
---
Cheers

Despite it's usually true, the "different one" will usually get the worst part.

It peaks higher AFAIK and scales into a great specc with gear, but it does require a lot more clever play and great mana managements. Too much thinking for me and my Windfury brain.

You're not going to have many red quests in darkshore at level 15 if you start in Auberdine. Usually you switch into that zone at level 11-12 just like you do with Barrens and Silverpine Forest.
---
I mean you'll probably get a couple of orange or red quests eventually, but at level 15 the first ones will probably be even green for you.
---
Activision Blizzard will never give you this experience back. 
---
ah that's interesting, seems like it's just Seal of Vengeance that relies on spell ratings, which was changed in 3.2 finally.
---
The misunderstanding probably comes form the fact that the SoC swings can be a miss, dodge, parry, or block whereas the JoC can only fail as a resist (from the SoC archive).
---
Also, yeah Ret scaling is pretty sad and its a weird class in general, good thing raid utility from crusader strike is just too good to not have 1.
---
&gt; always wondered about that...how do you zoom-in/out then?
---
You can bind it to shift (or other modifiers)+scroll, annoying to remember at first, but you get used to it 
---
Should add in pre-nerf Onyxia too when she conflag chained the entire raid lol.  I think besides Cthun lightning chain I never saw raids wipe so fast.
---
I think you mean 10 copper? You're not going to get anywhere close to 10 silver from 2 mobs at that level at all.
---
Just wait till Activation get their claws in.
---
"Patch 1.14 Dual spec now available in the newly implemented Classic wow Shop!"
---
only £29.99 per account per character per week
---
Whoa, what?  Mind blown.  I never noticed this.
---
I suggest another class. Hunter is difficult in PvP and you need to do a lot to not die instantly in PvP. Also in dungeons and raids you need to control your pet. Your pet is always extra damage. You won’t like leveling as hunter without pet. It is twice as painful as warrior. If you are planning on PvP server you won’t make it if you are not willing to try.
---
It's still a good sword for prot warriors. 
---
do you have a example for that spec? do you play hemo with daggers?
---
I was raised in STVietnam, molded by it.
---
There are a few changes, like switching up itemization to accommodate other specs, and modifying some talents a bit to make other specs more viable, which would have a huge net positive on the game and improve just about every aspect of gameplay, socially and otherwise. There's nothing to be lost by having some of the DPS/tank specs be more viable in game and so much to be gained.
---
How have you spelt 'Elf' wrong so many times?
---
Having all of the NPCs look like slightly modified or taller versions of the characters we could create in vanilla made it feel more immersive to me. 
---
When they started giving everyone a unique model it was kinda cool but the immersion took a hit IMO.
---
My point was, it doesn't apply to "memespecs". It applies to bad players.
---
&gt;While this ret rolls in contributes almost anything and takes loot. 
---
Your sentence makes it sound like ret are in fault, like OP. But that's not it.
---
In vanilla this is probably why it was nice there were friendly people around.  I dont think I spent much of that 6-10 range alone.
---
Take something small and unobtrusive like a crab. There's not enough crab pets. If you want you can pretend it just follows you around and you have no real connection to it.
---
I'm not talking about only changes that happened in 1.1-1.12. I'm saying it's ridiculous to act like 1.12.1 is some kind of holy grail that Blizzard was 100% satisfied with and wouldhave never changed class balance again if TBC didn't come along.
---
You're a bear? I'm more of an otter myself.
---
Considering how long a merger usually takes in terms of time, it is very likely the talks and contracts where done in 2006 already. So, just luck the did not change prior to the merge becoming effective.
---
Female orcs have the best posture in the Horde.
---
The other faction would see it as unintelligible gestures if you tried custom emotes. Only the ones programmed in could be understood.
---
Replace "weeks" with months. Right after launch we had two to three months of queues, lags, etc. as evident by the tons of free playtime in my WoW account history awarded for all the troubles in 2005.
---
Can't agree with you on that, I loved the look of my Tauren female warrior: [https://imgur.com/a/sxZ6no4](https://imgur.com/a/sxZ6no4)
---
There will be multiple servers. Just choose a lower populated one after the servers have settled.
---
For some people is about looks, but there's a huge group of people inside the closet who only plays female characters.
---
I've seen it on the private server scene, the LGBT community is huge, not kidding, most of them only go with female night elf/human.
---
\-Raiding: Pointless on the majority of fights and a small increase on ones it is usual for.  Most bosses have AoEs and nobody is going to heal your pet including you.
---
\-5 mans:  Useful especially while leveling.  At 60 it helps and everyone still expects you to have it but it does meager damage probably.
---
\-General Leveling: You need it
---
\-PvP : Honestly not that useful except against casters for pushback or if it is a long fight vs healer.  If you get the jump on someone while leveling or at max level aimed/multi/arcane with a crit deletes most squishies with decent gear.    
---
Lol wut? They are corpses raised into undeath by the scourge... you legit start in a mausoleum when you first create an undead chatacter.
---
If you need blessings and a dps, but only have one slot, bring a ret.
---
This screenshot isn't from Vanilla though...
---
You'd be surprised.
---
Everybody seems to be expecting high attrition from Classic in particular but I think we tend to underestimate how high it is at beginning in general.
---
For some games mere tutorial island completion is in the single digit.
---
*Back me in day we didn't have no goddamned girly man "Warmode"*
---
But yea, those people are in for a very rude awakening. Pvp in Vanilla was brutal. Griefing was the norm. Personally I'd often garrote/rupture people with low hp, pop back into stealth and then watch as they got killed by mobs. Good times.
---
Good point. Even I didn't Ret in vanilla. My bad. They sucked in TBC too. Not sure what I was thinking. I need coffee. 
---
I love Tanaris quests lol. It's a refreshing zone
---
I’ve been playing a Dwarf Priest and around 30 to 32’s been tough. My current wand isn’t cutting it and the one I need is from a rare spawn in the Scarlet Monastery Grave Yard. 
---
The problem is that if everyone in the raid gets world buffs and uses the elixirs ( and maybe even flasks ), you are STILL going to suck ass in comparison. So, additionally to your suggestions, join a guild where others cba to do that.
---
Then you will look OK in comparison.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is BS. As someone who's played through multiple vanilla servers, there's no way you're having 16 slot bags at level 45, a mount and all of your skills without ever grinding a mob in your life unless someone directly bought those for you.
---
If I want to afford my mount on a new server I always grind from 36 to 40 because I've found it's the only way to reliably get it. If you only do quests and never grind there's no chance you're going to have mount money at 40.
---
Usually by grinding in Swamp of Sorrows for those 4 levels I make around 150g, but if you have done zero grinding as you say there's a 0% chance you've gotten that much gold by questing to the point where you also have bags and all of your skills.
---
To afford all of that you probably need close to 200g which you for sure aren't getting from doing quests. I've leveled multiple characters on private servers and never in my life have I had that amount of gold at that level by just doing quests.
---
Hello there, can't thank you enough for this guide, could you provide a 1.12.1 pre-raid BiS list please ? I would be forever grateful ! Especially if you could include some options in case low drop rate or something ! Cheers mate 
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
I personally love that all specs are not perfectly balanced. It will force players playing specs that are not s tier to pay more attention to theory crafting and bis farming
---
shedo says on his guide that he needs Something like 25 crowd pummeler each week (if I remember correctly) for normal raid preparation, and if you also take into Account that its not a 100% droprate it may take a while every week. And how long did you Test your dps Rotation? I Imagine it very mana intensive with all the Power shifting and no consumables
---
Man those arrogant people.
---
Ok dude.
---
&gt;Player expectations are no longer the same as those from 2004.
---
Rectification : Pservers players expectations are no longer the same. Huge difference.
---
&gt; Actually, nevermind that. I straight up don't buy your claim.
---
Like why do you do this? What's the point? Are you in that world where your experience is the only viable one? where everyone who has a different opinion or experience is wrong? Please grow up.
---
&gt;Either you out-geared or out-leveled the other instances 
---
So first I'm talking about 5 mans level 60 only. I leveled up as ret.
---
I did not tank 5 mans in full green, if that's what you mean. Because at the beginning of my 60 experience I did it as ret, so I had blue mostly from there. But I didn't have any epic either when I began tanking.
---
And can you tell me how you outgear ZG as a paladin tank? Some of the gear you have there was competitive with BWL stuff, and it was so long to get geared back then, there is no way I outgear such an instance as a prot pal. I didn't do naxx, wasn't R14, and did around half the content in AQ40 only.
---
&gt; you ran with a hardcore guild group
---
Nope, as you can see with my raid accomplishments above.
---
&gt; or you had infinite time to PuG these dungeons with the multiple wipes or low DPS necessary for a Paladin tank to successfully hold threat *at level.*
---
What? But wait do you really believe prot paladins are not viable in 5 mans? Lol. I'm sorry but I'm out of words here.
---
Of course on single boss fights in 5 mans we agreed to wait a few seconds so I could build threat, but then what? Is that the definition of unviable?
---
&gt;After being burned by a Paladin tank, Balance Druid, or Elemental Shaman (outside PvP) they will quickly get over the open-minded lovefest. It's just my opinion, sure, based on playing both pservers and retail. But honestly? I think mine is the more realistic, less pie-in-the-sky utopian opinion. 
---
No comment. Enjoy Classic mate.
---
Personally I could careless what spec you roll, but you guys have to remember no cross realms.  It doesnt take long to give yourself or your guild a bad name.  Back in Vanilla and TBC I played a prot warrior, people knew me, and loved when I tanked an instance.  At the end of TBC I was known as the best tank on our server.  
---
The question, How long does it take before people dont want to group with you? Its great that you are having fun and all, BUT you joined the group as dps who isn't doing DPS. What would be said if it was the other end? I come as a healer, but I mainly dps and people die every pull OR I was the tank, but I used a two hander and the mage/rogue tanked  the instance. I dont think anyone would want to group with me agian.  
---
I dont expect anyone to min/max in a pug, but same goes if you are here to dps/heal/tank you should be atleast doing that.
---
Exactly, to each his own. I always enjoy seeing the race/gender or race/class combinations. How boring would it be if everyone liked the same class? (*cough* looking at you retail wow and your blood elves *cough*)
---
I have the most basic problem of Horde vs Alliance.  Alliance on one side would be my favorite for leveling zones (Redridge and Duskwood in particular) and I like deadmines.  Horde however I expect to have a far greater likelihood of instant queues for BGs with Alliance have a small possibility of terrible queue times.  So I feel like I might like leveling as Alliance, get to max level and then regret it for pvp reasons.  Or I can play as Horde which is fine (played an undead through bwl on a fresh server during vanilla) for leveling but is a much more stable choice for PvP.  
---
My mind was blown about the -level range. Played more than most and never noticed that the "still green" range varies so much between L9 and L55.
---
This is a non-issue. 
---
The reality is that very, very little people RP to the extremes of involving all the lore of WoW.
---
The reality is that the people on RP servers that RP mostly stick to the basics: I'm a dwarf or orc and *play* like I'm a dwarf or orc, scottisch accent and all.  And the enemy is the enemy and needs to be squashed. 
---
The reality is that the majority of the playerbase on an RP server rolled on one because they expected such a server to be more mature and easy-going. Which is absolutely the truth. 
---
THAT was a part of Vanilla.
---
I just play the game and share my experiences. You just find my posts and talk bullshit to try and undermine what I speak about. The gear I have is from my own accomplishments prior to raids and what I receive is from tanking in raids. What exactly are these "external advantages" exactly? You bring up really ambiguous terms to push whatever agenda you have.

XP is calculated from a formula, it's not unique to mobs.

Kevin Jordan, the class design dev for vanilla WoW, gave interesting insight on the ClassiCast show about the tuning process for Paladins.  He wasn't happy merely buffing numbers for underperforming specs but wanted to make sure the gameplay approach for each spec was unique and compelling.  For example, when asked why he didn't simply give vanilla prot paladins a taunt, he said he needed time to develop something uniquely different from the warrior's version.  He knew whatever went live in the game needed to be the permanent solution because you cannot take something away from players without backlash.  His time was limited so he had to prioritize which specs to focus.  Since ret and prot were an underperforming spec, you had very few players playing those specs compared to the overwhelming feedback he'd receive about holy.  This made him focus efforts on holy's gameplay for the paladin vanilla patch.  It wasn't until the TBC launch he implemented a functioning ret and prot spec.
---
It's interesting to hear the former vanilla WoW devs have no interest in working on the Classic WoW project.  They would be too compelled to make changes they never got a chance to implement the first time around.
---
This was my experience as well. We had a badass feral tank. My favorite to run dungeons and small raids like ZG. He still got oneshot by Lashlayer but that is why they are offtanks. 
---
I can confirm they said at blizzcon they wouldn't be doing any balance changes.
---
According to many comments you can see on this sub, from people claiming having experience from pservers, no I agree with the guy you answered above. Most of pservers players seem to be impatient, and not hating on the bad never-learning players, but on players using offspec they don't like. Like the opposite of being chill, community oriented, and agreeing with the Vanilla values back then.
---
I know it must have evolved with pservers, but keep in mind there are plenty of players like me who neither do play retail nor pservers, and that are gonna be back. If you treat them like shit, they won't stay. If you find that fine, then I've nothing else to say, just enjoy your toxic game.
---
you can buy them for like 17 dollars a piece off their website and then trade them in game for the "live" servers its not a big deal but on the progression servers they are so toxic to the game.
---
The Baron sword is okay for PvP on a holy/prot pala. Good 30 sec dot to keep rogues out of stealth and other classes from banishing. It's damage sucks but you just use it like a warrior would use rend. 
---
I know perfectly well what specs are capable of what. You misread my message if you think I'm defending prot pallies.  
---
I don't think anybody thinks Blizzard was completely satisfied with the state of the game at the end of vanilla, but I'm not sure what that has to do with classic.
---
Okay so there is a back entrance that goes literally straight to that boss. What's the drop rate is 40%. I imagine it only takes a minute or two to get to him especially faster if you have Sprint. I'd say about an hour or so every week to get most of them.   
---
   
---
As for the DPS rotation, the only boss I had were Mark of the wild an omen of clarity. With just those buffs in an intervate, I did 330 DPS to a level 60 dummy over the course of 10 minutes. Keep in mind this was in 60 blues with hit gear, so my stats weren't amazing nor did I have wolf helm.   
---
Imagine just getting buffs, a crowd pummeler and wolf helm
---
I always like shaman tanking. When I was level 60, with very good dungeon gear, i had about 33% chance to dodge with the agi totem. I remember a bad pull in ubrs happened and the warrior MT died halfway through the pack. I was OT. I managed to survive 6 mobs swinging at me because I dodged/parried about half of the attacks. I do agree with mana problems though. Always drinking after every other pull which didn't seem to bother Horde as they were too excited to see a shaman tank. I played around with a lot of builds and I found eye of the storms procs being awesome for AoE. Since shaman cannot be crit immune, it procced often enough for chain lightning in between rockbiter swings and earth shock.
---
I question if cross-faction RP will actually be that difficult. I'd be surprised if people don't make a discord for each RP server, and meet people from the opposing faction there and plan out RP events. There's no reason you *need* to go through blizzard's crappy UI systems, and you just need two guild leaders to find each other to start setting something up.
---
2handers can kite and are better for PvP. Also arms spec is superior for cleaving 2-3 mobs. 
---
There's too many factors to account for to do this kind of math.
---
If you want a proper comparison you're gonna have to sim it and even that is pretty fucking hard, like how are you going to properly sim to account for SS?
---
not really. Retail had such things too.

I wasnt there for launch, but new servers released after launched were massive clusterfucks, which i imagine is going to be similar to classic launch unless they release a lot of servers.
---
However, new servers had massively increased mob spawn rates, like literally 1 mob/sec, to the point where you had to pull mobs away from where they spawned to kill them or otherwise you would fight them endlessly. The startig areas were extremely crowded, but i never had problems leveling on D1 of new servers (i did this on 3 different ones).
---
I dont understand why no one ever talks about the vanilla experience solution of new servers when talking about sharding and instead are trying to come up with x/y/z solutions.
---
Do you use ret being a "meme spec" (it isn't and hasn't been since 3.0) as an excuse to play poorly? 
---
Even back then I paid like $8/mo for unlimited texts.
---
Agree that official will be less elitist but that simply means more wipes and shit raids because less screening. 
---
I swapped to sword of omen and vanquisher sword when I could get those at my warrior and it was quite decent in both leveling and PvP. If you don’t care about min maxing DW can work just fine. (Got to be fury though). I swapped from WW axe at late 30 (I think, it’s so long ago)
---
Thats kind of the excitement right?
---
Dodge isn't the best for paladin but parry is very good. If you parry an attack, your swing timer is reduced by 40% and if it is less than 40% left, it is an instant swing. You also do not need to overlevel/overgear to tank. You will be quicker but it's not necessary.
---
After a long while reading stuff, asking more knowledgeable players, and considering my options and my distastes, I came up with the decision of rolling a tauren warrior with alchemy and herbalism. I would like to know what kind of hardships will I have to endure to go through with such a choice, since without mining and blacksmithing I won't have access to stuff like armor and weaponry from crafting, for example.
---
I'm also really interested in Shaman, but I don't stop reading that going as anything but Resto is considered as "memespec". The idea of casting stuff AND whacking people with oversized weapons is a huge plus, seeing that Death Knights aren't here to be rolled, but I'd like to know what is the reality of rolling Shaman. Thanks in advance.
---
What patch was it on? Were there talent revamps? Gold change? Class changes? Or did you play on a 1.12 server?
---
Raids were implemented last minute in Vanilla this is why there are specs that don´t work there. They were considered far from important content by the devs. So was pvp which was also almost left out. The intended main content has always been the leveling experience where all specs shine. 
---
Rolled on Archimonde which was designated the PvP guild community "official server".
---
Stocked up on Red Bull to maximise the day one grind, played for as long as possible before going to bed.
---
Next day couldn't login, server was down.  Guild made the decision to re-roll on Laughing Skull
---
Fuck the horde male models, Tauren men are the only ones that look decent. Otherwise, troll/orc/forsaken are scoliosis city. Also, I don't really get why it's a given to play the same gender in the first place. My WoW characters are just that, characters. I don't see them as a self-insert, or that they're me, at all. I'm just playing as them, and I don't really care which gender they are so long as they don't look like hunched over freaks.
---
Plus UD females have the flip animation and that is dope.
---
Classic is not in the past, it's in the future. Unless I slept for a *very* long time last night, summer 2019 hasn't happened yet.
---
Further number changes on class abilities beyond 1.12.1 with a Vanilla philosophy in mind (i.e. no "bring the player not the class" bullshit) would *not* break Classic.
---
Cthun was not really a number issue that simply got nerfed, the problem with him was tentacles spawning in the stomuch 1-2 shotting clothies as they entered.
---
People were stuck on C'thun for months, our server was slow to open the gates and still, we had 6 weeks where we couldn't kill him, untill he got hotfixed, then Nihilum and 20 other guilds killed him within 24 hours.
---
From what I have seen on private servers a lot of people won't make it past the 2nd quest hub.
---
But maybe because classic wow will require payment there will be more of an incentive to keep playing.
---
Oh yeah that feels great!  Hey I don't have enough gear to compete on DPS.. guess what you have to wait for everyone else to get everything because you're doing less dps.
---
I hope to never encounter your kind in classic.
---
T3 Warrior Dreadnaught set looks amazing on them.
---
I agree that a full comparison with talents and ability damage included requires a sophisticated calculator. But auto attacks are the majority of DPS, especially before bloodthirst/MS, and my math shows that dual wield and 2h do roughly equal auto attack DPS. Mainly I posted this because I keep seeing people claiming dual wield is awful whenever the question comes up, but it really isn't.
---
Why do you disdain bfa's PvP?
---
Well, that's kinda a part of the problem isn't it.
---
Spec A gets a large part of its dps from AA
---
Spec B gets much less of its dps from AA
---
Looking at only AA of course you're going to conclude A is better.
---
Dual spec starts to defeat the purpose of having to choose talents. If you could swap talents whenever, you'd almost always have the talents available that you need for the situation.
---
Part of the flavour is that you're not always optimized.
---
So I've levels my 4th hunter to 60 (well almost 58 now) completely survival. I tried it because I wanted to learn how to wave huge raptor strike crits in-between my auto shots and abusing the 5mps to almost have full mana every fight. If you want to fight head on you gonne need to relay on Dodge and party to deal mongoos strike and counter attack and use deterrence on cd. They both deal minimal damage. As for wing clip it's just a slowing attack. Deals zero to none damage. So in short, you won't be able to kill mobs quickly with just melee attack. But there is a fun catch, if you are using serpent sting and immolation trap you can kill single targets fairly fast while melee them down. But I would still recommend pet and bm obviously
---
McConnell monkaS
---
I honestly don't know what you're referring to here. Neither spec particularly favors auto attacks over ability damage, though arms is an obvious 2h spec and fury can do well as either 2h or dual wield.
---
i probably won't play classic but w/e
---
my point is you have the same starting point for all people of your class/spec. so if you had a guy who has his full pre bis vs the dude with maybe 2 or 3 pieces with the rest being random lvl 45 greens, there's a difference.
---
and just to be clear, if you're like 20-25% below the average, you shouldn't be skipped on loot, but if you're legit being outperformed by the tanks, come on.. 
---
Maybe put in the effort and farm some gear outside of raids (which is mostly better than what is available in MC anyway) and you'll be able to compete.
---
Can, to an extent, bringing Classic servers back online and investing in completely new server infrastructure be justified and end up being beneficial for future WoW server performance? I mean, I know nothing about this but if they decided to rework how their servers operate and make them be able to handle 100vs100 players in Hillsbrad without a hitch, surely that would be beneficial for them?
---
I mean, just because they're re-releasing an old game doesn't make it a game that's in the "future" I'm not sure what's the point of some clever word twisting like that.
---
It's like saying that the new MediEvil which is coming out in 2019 is a new game of the "future" when it's just a retro Playstation game that came out in 1996 and is being released again with higher fidelity graphics.
---
Yeah technically speaking vanilla is coming out in 2019 since it doesn't officially exist anymore, but I think everybody understands that it's a game from 2005 which is getting released again.
---
But all of this seems like pretty pointless rhetoric, whether it's in the "future" or not doesn't change the fact that it's a game from 2005.
---
It would be interesting to see if the dedicated hardcore guilds today could beat the 'mathematically impossible' version.  But it's a moot point because they don't have the data from the patches prior to 1.12.
---
You want a class with LESS interaction? Wowee. I mean, I never thought hitting CTRL+1 and occasionally CTRL+3 was that much work.
---
Raiding; not much worse
---
5 mans; youd be gimping the group when things go to shit
---
leveling; horrifically slow
---
pvp; significantly gimped
---
&gt; Didn't they have PTR realms then?
---
Not for new raids at least. Things were apparently always a bit broken when the top guilds progressed as a result. 
---
Just play on an RP server, and you will have no one batting an eye. 
---
The canonical short story "Dark Mirror" explains why his body was changed
---
It would ruin MY experience. I hate sharding, it's everything I despise about "modern MMO's". So take that attitude elsewhere. 
---
Imo it's around lvl 43. You already have most of your spells and talents, your mount hype is gone, and leveling is getting really slow. I found that the last 5/10 levels are way faster, and that was on a server with no Thorium Point quests for example. Winterspring is great for grinding, and the cauldron quests in EPL give great xp. And at that level you can start farming your pre-raid BiS so you can spam dungeons if you don't want to quest. 
---
wow luanch was at the time, the biggest fail of the century followed by Sony Planetside catastrophe. WoW didnt not have many servers to split the players up. It was awful, coupled with shitty internet speed - many folks raging. Forums was littered with hate - but those who made it in enjoyed themselves with the chaos, for this may have been for many, their first true mmorpg (if they never touched UO/EQ) 
---
I just assumed we were talking about an established group not someone first entering MC which will be only a brief period.
---
I also remembering Seal of the Crusader being OP in the beta.  It would grant attack speed AND boost attack power.  My beta paladin running around Elwynn had like 40 paperdoll dps.  Then they nerfed it for launch by making it decrease your attack power instead.
---
All this makes it maddening when trying to mentally compute whether or not it's worth it to run across the zone to do those last few yellow/green quests.
---
they didnt have that many servers. They kept adding servers throughout the next 3 days
---
[Try telling that to Esfand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yWXeywPj3U)
---
in an established group you will probably have a few people of every class that you know they can pull their weight and you obviously will want them to get gear first (especially mt and healers) because you know they are reliable.
---
i totally get what you were saying
---
My plan was I would try to search for a discord or guild specifically focused on first time playing vanilla content. I boosted in legion and have never actually touched any of this content so I think the best way to experience the classic servers is to experience it the way it originally was: blindly and with much failure.
---
I see where you're coming from!  I hope I run into more people like you in classic!

Uhh, no it's not just semantics. What it means is that this sentiment:
---
&gt;the game ends at that final patch and there's not much you can change about that when it's in the past
---
Is completely untrue.
---
I believe retail for one simple reason. New expansions/patches. Vanilla wow will stagnate eventually, it always does. You can view private servers as examples. It's usually around AQ40 when you'll see the population plummet due to raid logging. Dungeon runs will be scarce after this time. Once Naxx releases, the tombstone is being set in place for the server to rest. The only reason vanilla continues is due to FRESH servers where people can start over from scratch. If Blizzard does not continue into TBC, or even a completely different direction, the servers will die and they'll have to create these FRESH servers to keep their subs.
---
Paranoia is over blown. You may spend a little more time in the starting zones, but once you get to the teens, you'd be smooth sailing
---
I am one of those “no changes” freaks and in my eyes no changes means no changes lol. Was there sharding in patch 1.12? NO. Should there be sharding at classic wow launch? NO. It’s simple. 
---
&gt; You're right, and I wish there was a better way for us to voice those criticisms directly to Blizzard, but at what point do those 2 main criticisms become stale here? 
---
Until you have a better way for us to voice our concerns we're happy to continue this way. 
---
hah, that took a 180 real quick didn't it? xD i appreciate the sentiment though :) 
---
Because ideally you want to nail the right amount of servers, staying on the "few" side. In Vanilla more than ever cooperation is necessary to go forth and empty realms are a real danger. If you day 1 with many servers you may end up with some of them being underpopulated in a couple of months.
---
Having shards for just the few days would be much more conservative.
---
But it may be an actual change in the experience. I'm trying to highlight the inherent hypocrisy.
---
RP is better in Vanilla and this is why:
---
Just as it is for the game in general, *the world is alive* in Vanilla.
---
If you choose to wear a cool hat instead of an ugly orange clown hat that has better stats, you look cooler but people know there is a cost to your looks.
---
If you're a Scorpid hunter then you'll live in certain areas and may even be wearing Heavy Scorpid Armor.
---
Needing to communicate cross faction to RP? Complete bullshit. The other faction is completely foreign to you. Whatever they do is of their own mind - you can only try and understand. If they're docile or hostile that's all part of the *real world of Warcraft*.
---
You confuse role playing with theatre whereas what we want is a role playing **game**.
---
You may have selfies and toys in BfA, but **you have no game** to  make anything meaningful.
---
RP is better in Vanilla, not in BfA.
---
Well, i'd say ti would easily be 4-6 hours of gameplay (at normal speed)
---
You must not actually play because meme specs can and do get out dpsed by good tanks regularly... 
---
Why not just go to an area, kill things, rinse and repeat until someone shows up and then try to kill them too?
---
The idea of having a third-party adjudicator deciding victory terms and conditions is a bit of a cock-block and I would never see it work. There are BGs for that already, and killing only people who are willingly asking for it kills half the fun in it, because killing players who are actually leveling and don't want to be bothered with PvP is more important for the war aspect of the game. 
---
To give you an example - on one server, my guild was constantly raiding Redridge because they're assholes. An Alliance guild (who will be playing on a RP-PVP server in Classic) tried to stop us and even made [obnoxious videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsI1jBRhRO0) to challenge us. My guild beat them bloody on every organized raid they had and we even went [wiped them when their leader decided to retire the guild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMDCXeo__R8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h2s) by staging an event in Redridge.
---
The point I'm trying to make was that in this sort of organic encounter, if anyone had come to my guild (or theirs for that matter) and said - "hey, let's do a fair 20 v 20 on top a random hill nowhere" I would've said no from the start - or worse, I would've said yes but had another 20-30 Hordes coming down from Searing Gorge while we were going at it. 
---
I mean, why should I care? I break some imaginary terms of engagement and the Alliance are "declared" victors by a small group of people who may not even be from my same faction, even though I killed all of them in one spot and proceeded to camp the entire area for 2 hours straight. Actions speak more than words or acknowledgements. Or how about they win the engagement and when the next battle in the adjacent area is schedule, I camp them at their meetup point right at their Flight Master. 
---
The only "honor" at stake for any guild is that vis-a-vis their own faction. Not because of some vague sense of belonging or emotional attachment if anything, but only because that's the only thing that can have long lasting consequences on your reputation and thus your ability to recruit and work with other players from others guilds. Whole server pissed at my guild because I harbor ninja looters or because I work with players from the enemy faction - that I care about. A bunch of people pissed at me because I killed all the Alliance players that wanted a fair fight in the open world? That's free advertisement for my WPvP guild right there. 
---
&gt; How could I improve this idea?
---
Get them to start doing World-PvP raids. I [wrote a guide on how to do such raids](https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903) quite recently, and I promise I will be writing more as soon as Classic WoW comes out. The less you try to organize and involve yourself with BG-like formalities, the better it will be. 
---
For the server side RP aspect of it, ask each belligerent to record and/or take screenshots of their raids and victories and then you - the third party - can act as a war reporter and create the narrative of their actions around that. 
---
Thanks for the ping /u/Teeb 
---
Wouldn't say far more, but indeed more info is better.
---
Maybe we can combine these 2 for a super exp sheet?
---
No where is it stated that every class is supposed to have a raid viable dps spec or more specifically that ret is supposed to be a raid dps spec. 
---
Yes, there likely will be a change in experience from how it was in 2004. It is also 2019 now, that fact is unavoidable. When Jagex released old school RuneScape they did it with no changes, and yes tutorial island was overpopulated - I remember.
---
Regardless of that, sharding will be an even much bigger change in experience than not having it. After the starting zones are done it will begin to even out too. Please believe me when I say the game will be better without sharding. 
---
You're in luck! There's a version of WoW with years of new content and balance changes.
---
It's called BfA. Go knock yourself out.
---
I'm not sure what part of that is untrue apart from the "it's in the past" which we already settled in the previous comments.
---
Usually when you talk about things they have very clear definitions. In video game terms when people talk about specific games it's quite easy to understand what they are referring to.
---
Like if I mention Super Mario 64 I'm talking about the game that was made by Nintendo in 1996, and if you ask the company what "Super Mario 64" refers to they'll give you the same answer.
---
In this case when people talk about vanilla WoW it's pretty easy to define when the game took place, which is between those patches. After 1.12 the game went into TBC, which is the first expansion and not vanilla WoW anymore.
---
You can even go to Wikipedia and read about it, but I think this is really common knowledge that literally every person should know about. I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the different expansions that has come out since the launch of WoW and I don't think anyone is going to argue that vanilla WoW is a part of those expansions.
---
Just like when you refer to TBC you refer to the specific expansion that happened after vanilla, then Wrath is that specific expansion. Vanilla is the first iteration of the game before any expansions took place.
---
Absolutely this. Also whilst specs like ret paladin and balance druid aren't ever going to top the dps meters, when played correctly and with good gear they can perform as well as required to clear most 40 man content.
---
I wouldn't take an entire raid of them but I'll certainly be recruiting people who want to play what they're specced as instead of shoe-horning them into antiquated ideology
---
As has been said, buffs to PvE would cause an imbalance to PvP.
---
Theres only 2 things that wouldnt affect PvP; threat talents and talents for "enemies that yield experience" However, I honestly REALLY hate these PvE only talents, as it really takes away from the more organic kind of non-optimized specs we had in Vanilla.
---
Shaman, Paladins and Priests are all on par in PvP and would require massive overhauls to balance for both.
---
Druids however, I wouldnt mind seeing a slight damage increase, adding DPS from weapons like they did later on I think would be fine, since Feral Druids are seriously underpowered in both PvE and PvP. You would have to scale their DPS for leveling, as they would be pretty OP with just a straight damage buff from 1-59, but thats about it. Equally, Oomkins could also get some better mana regen talents for the same reason or maybe a talent that makes them more mobile deep in the balance tree or reduces their pushback (something like Ice Barrier).
---
I disagree.
---
So to be clear you're saying that it's impossible for Blizzard to make balance changes in Classic, a video game that will be released in 2019.
---
You may have got this response before, Actually Im sure you have. But my message is pally is fine tank anything 21-59 and starts to struggle in raids. If you are ok healing in raids and have a set, you may still have a chance to tank raids when people don't show, that's how my friend started tanking raids as a pally. He worked harder, was better and tried harder than his equals. It's vanilla.
---
Vanilla I rolled human lock main, this time going horde lock to see the other side of the game.... Kinda wanna play with the +5% pet DMG/and stun resilience but don't like male orc caster look...
---
Leaves me with orc female.... :-(
---
[Dwarfs with Ashkandi](http://image.sportsmansguide.com/adimgs/l/1/154735_ts.jpg)
---
That's incredible. Are you saying that queues were a viable solution to starter zone overcrowding?
---
So sharding is *not* necessary to "fix" this "problem"?
---
WoW, the people at Activision Blizzard are going to be absolutely ecstatic when they hear that they don't have to implement sharding.
---
/s
---
Skrrrt
---
I still do!
---
&gt; I didn't even mention world of warcraft.
---
Precisely. You might be better making a post like this over at r/Blizzard.
---
amen brother
---
So I've seen this post before but no context was even added to explain this. This ret pala who was not equipped with pre-raid bis joined a pug run because they just wanted dps to fill the slot. He explained to them prior but they took him anyway. He also did not roll on or get any gear. He just wanted to play the game and do MC and after they finish, he receives these whispers. This is showing how toxic other players can be even after pugging and completing MC just because he wanted to play a game how he enjoys playing it. It's sad to see all this hate in the other comments due to no context and a playstyle they don't like.
---
Animations for me. I just prefer some over others.
---
I 've had it worse.   discovering she actually wasn't a she...
---
Oh, well, yes. To me it would not change anything. If there won't be any sharding i will simply log in, take a screenshot and come back after a week. No big deal.
---
agreed, and I'm a vanilla no change advocate, and it seems i will get my wish, but a BC server that will eventually come will be the pinnacle of my wow experience.
---
Hunters are designed to be used with pets. I understand the want for a ranged physical dps without the pet but it’s not viable. You have many options for a pet though also.
---
That’s one way to do it. Me on the other hand, no way! I’m going to fight for that XP, alongside my friends. I’m ready! 
---
That's great info man, I'll be sure to memorize this.
---
If your willing to farm MCPs and are alliance with powershifting you can put out some pretty good dps, I mean you have to work 3x as hard but still nothing to sneeze at
---
Uh, I don't believe you. And I don't believe you because I have seen the DPS leaderboards at Legacy Players. It is practically impossible to outdps a fury warrior as a retardin. Fury Warriors do so much more damage than everyone else that it's not even funny.
---
being part of 2 massive pserver launches:  those 4-6 hours are more like 20 hours.  Your ebst bet is, find 4 friends, and group with 5 and immediately run to the 2nd part of the zone where mobs are lvl 4-8 instead of lvl 1-3 . And skip all starting quests except deliveries. 
---
With 5 lvl 1 characters you can kill mobs of lvl 5 or 6, and as soon as you are lvl 3 or 4 it will go better.  Even then, many other groups will have discovered this and there will still be a huge competition, but you will be able to find some mobs at least. 
---
They've already made plenty of tweaks I think, but I don't think they're going to touch the gameplay aspect of it (which they've also said themselves) because the whole point is to bring back an old game that originally came out in 2004.
---
Most of these usual reissued "retro" games also usually go through a graphic overhaul to make them more appealing to people who never played them when they originally came out, but I think it's the same with classic seeing as Blizzard already updated all the models to hi-res and some of the animations are different and sharper. I'm personally fine with that because literally all other reissued games have some graphical tweaks to them - it's part of making them appeal to a new audience so people other than the collectors buy and play them as well.
---
But usually when old games get released again companies never touch the gameplay aspect of them, just tweak the graphics to a more modern standard and that's as far as they'll go.
---
Agreed. But also, if a spec is performing then it should be treated like the rest of the dps yeah? The point is do good damage. We don't care what spec. If we wipe because of lack of damage the first target is specs that are abnormal and that's fair.
---
Nah, you don't get frost bolt till level 4.
---
&gt;  2 days and 9 wipes later we downed that bitch for an alliance first Ony kill. 
---
Sounds like a relaxing raid schedule. 
---
I beg to differ. 
---
it sure does, my favorite time in the game was the two weeks before tbc released but vanilla had tbc talents
---
I think what they meant was, they'll get to Darkshore and quest till level 15 at which point all their quests are 18+
---
Nightfall has an entire other world bro. I'm sure you'll hear about it eventually.
---
Ret paladins are a gift.
---
Any paladin you see in a BG not healing helps horde so much.
---
Tanaris is a level 60 battleground, that level 40 characters can enter to do some quests.
---
The only appealing caster class to me is Warlock and I play one in BfA, my worry is that I'll be burned out by the time classic comes out so that I won't roll one then. Anyone else experiencing similar feelings?
---
Well yeah obviously the performance is the key talking point here and that's also why most of these specs aren't very revered, because they don't perform that well - if they would then they wouldn't be so talked against.
---
I'll be leveling with my wife, and I want to be able to tank dungeons for us, since she's only really done the Cats versions.  What class is best at tanking pre-60?  We're Ally, so Pally is an option. 
---
Survival is not a melee spec in Classic.  It's either for freshly dinged 60 because of the +Hit or for super late game when you have T2 or better to profit from the +5% agility bonus. Both are meant to be played range.
---
I agree with everything you are saying, still my current vanilla guild would clear all vanilla content with 33 people with dungeon gear and has for years.
---
It's just not hard if everyone knows the fights, and they will.
---
I'm sorry what?
---
Hey bud, I'm in the same boat as you. Pushing 30 now and with life commitments I may not have as much time to play. When I do have time, I usually have a good few hours or all night, but when I don't have time I can't log in for days. 
---
I am expecting that a lot of people will be in the same situation as us come launch of classic. I also expect these people to stick with the game for 6+ months, whereas people who play all day will probably burn out. I think there will be a bunch more mature guilds who have flexible expectations on raiding, at least this is what I am hoping. 
---
Most retro re-released games aren't MMOs. One that *is* an MMO is OSRS, which started out providing the exact patch requested but later made changes based on community feedback (super-majority required votes).
---
I don't anticipate changes right away, but they're absolutely possible and would not be against the spirit of Vanilla, which was an ever changing piece of software.
---
That's what I said in my first comment and that's what I've been trying to get through to you for 10 comments or however many times I've had to repeat myself now.
---
Yeah maybe. I haven't done Darkshore in a while (last time was over a year ago) so honestly can't remember much from the quest level ranges from the top of my head.
---
I know that when it comes to Barrens and Silverpine forest I usually go to those zones at level 12 and it carries me over to Stonetalon and Ashenvale.
---
Yes, i know. I meant 4-6 hours of gameplay with an healthy amount of competition. Of course if you have to fight 30 mins for every single mob kill the time will increase drastically.
---
But this enforce my point that it isn't exactly a small amount of time.
---
I, a level 33 warrior, have just finished questing in darkshire. My only fear is Mor'Ladim and Stitches. I grouped with fellow alliance and have no fear of horde besides the gankers in Redridge. Not a care in the world.
---
I snag the quests at the rebel camp and nesingwary's camp. I am ready to take on STV. Surely this can't be as bad as people say.
---
I start with Nesingwary's animal mastery quests. Easy Kill quests. Suddenly I see a horde off in the distance. He seems to be doing his own thing, but I better keep an eye on him. He is a hunter. His pet's name is Charlie. 
---
I wait for him to Leave before fighting a nearby tiger. I charge in and before I miss my first attack, I have 4 warlock DoTs on me and am Feared into a nearby crocolisk. Save me Lt. Dan. I die a quick death
---
Behold a quick walk back from the spirit healer.
---
I revive and am quickly killed again by same warlock. I leave to grab some food and give the warlock enough time to leave the area. That was my mistake. 
---
After a sandwich and small existential crisis I return. I walk back to my body and revive. I am safe. I sit down and eat my last piece of bread to gain health back quickly. My mistake sitting down. This entices a lvl 60 rogue to ambush me and get a 100% to crit me and one shot me and my 1400 health. He does not one shot me and my superior mail armor. I have a hundred health left. He sees I am a warrior and becomes fear itself.
---
Vanish.
---
Sap.
---
I now am CC'd a full 30seconds.
---
The a wolf naned Charlie sprints to me and taunts me with growl before killing me.
---
Maybe Nesingwary's is not the place to start in STV. I should've started with the rebel camp quests, how foolish of me.
---
I journey a short ways to Kurzen's compound. I see panther's for the nesingwary quest. My pace quickens.
---
I quickly Identify the npcs I must kill. Jungle fighters and Satan ( medicine men ).
---
Tears come to my eyes, I see other alliance players and no horde in sight. Visions of the good ole days grouping with people in wetlands and duskwood flood my mind. I weep for a PvE server.
---
I reach out to my fellow alliance members and say hello. I know we both need this friendship to keep our sanity. 
---
Something is wrong. They do not respond. I invite them to a party, they cannot ignore the invite box in the middle of their screen. I finally get a reply. "Only need 1 more". "Almost done". "F*ck off".
---
My alliance members finish their quest and move on. I have never felt so alone. I must get past this zone and enter what can only be eternal bliss.
---
I attack a jungle fighter alone. My mistake for not being hit capped at lvl 33. I make one too many misses and die. The spirit healer is the one next to Nesingwary's. I shudder. Quickly heading back to the compound.
---
I choose a different target this time. A medicine man. Oh of all the mistakes I have made this was my greatest. The fight begins and I quickly over power him. After 10minutes of fighting, I get him to 50% health. 
---
His hands begins to glow instantaneously, before any interrupt can land, he casts Renew on himself. I shriek a sound I have never made before as I watch his health restore in large chunks back to 100%.
---
His mana bar: 80%.
---
This war wages on, his mana bar depleted, my health running low. I have lost track of all time and space. How time makes fools of us all. 
---
We both are at 5% health. The fate of this battle will be determined by my chance to hit him. A cool sweat drips down my back. We are both at 1%. I see it haopen. My swing misses.
---
I watch his fist wind up in slow motion.
---
The combat text reads: Miss. I am in shock. I get another chance. Praise the Sun I have not seen in many days.
---
My weapon strikes true, a glacing blow, killing my enemy. I feel victorious for the first time since this war started.
---
I go to loot the jungle remedy for the quest from his lifeless corpse. It didn't drop. My mind breaks as I stare at the 1 silver and 13 copper I am awarded for my kill. I look out my window with fond memories of real life friends and my family I not seen in many months. How did life become this?
---
A frost bolt cast from 40 yds away hits and kills me. My mistake I should have been preparing for a troll mage to ambush me. I snap back to reality. 
---
This is war. War never changes.
---
I scoot away from Nesingwary and continue with the entry quest for Kurzens compound for the next week straight relying on a 50/50 chance to make a killing blow. I die countless times by both npc and horde alike.
---
I finally finish the quest. My first STV quest is done. I turn it in and realize I am only 10%  of my xp in level 33 and will be in this zone until level 42.
---
I smile a wry smile. I have become deranged by this war. Will my family and friends ever see me the same way? I do not know and I do not care. 
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
Screams the relief. 
---
I only have 2 buttons on my mouse and I too like to mess with the camera so I just bind attack/return to the two keys right below the rest of my attack keys. Probably not the most optimal way to do things but it works
---
Right? All these people who apparently didn't know how to be properly toxic when they were 12 sure seem to have it down now after years of training at the 4chan academy. 
---
WTF y downvot?!?!?!
---
Finally someone speaking the truth
---
4 hours each day.  We took an ungodly amount of time to recover from wipes.
---
Agreed.
---
Does skull-level mobs still give 120% or is it less? 
---
Yup I'm aware of OSRS and that some people don't like a lot of the changes they put into the game, and also nobody would probably argue that it's the original classic version of the game at this point.
---
So far what we know is that Blizzard is planning to release vanilla WoW so that's what I'm going by. If they would change the game to something else I don't think it's fair to call it vanilla anymore or market it as such.
---
I'm also personally not really a fan of majority votes even though it's probably the most profitable for a company, but that's also one of the reasons why the game is where it's at today.
---
I wouldn't. Your pet makes up a lot of your damage and in open world leveling or pvp is invaluable. Not to mention - and I know this from experience - it's a pain in the ass to kite mobs away at lower levels with just conc shot, so you're probably gonna end up meleeing them, which is really not a good strategy. I have good melee weapons for my level and the only time I'd melee is as a last resort if my pet was incapacitated and I couldn't get far away enough, or if it was a squishier mob/player I knew I could melee down (with the help of my pet) and wouldn't bother trying to kite. It's not really a viable long-term strategy. 
---
TLDR from one hunter to another I would not recommend, but you do you man
---
Is any mentions of the vanilla increased spawn rates for new servers just invisible to people? I cant understand why everyone ignores it.
---
It does disproportionally affect 'memespecs' though. Especially because they're often picked by people who are less knowledgeable about the game in general. Veteran players are less likely to pick a spec that they know is going to be useless. The fact that people roll these classes because 'ehh.. It can't be as bad as people say, let's go for it and try it anyway.' is the first red flag that they're just bad/inexperiencied players. 
---
When you have specs that are subpar across the board mainly being played by people who are bad across the board, the term 'memespec' only reinforces itself. I'm not saying it's 100% impossible to do decent dps with e.g. a feral, but people are absolutely justified in not wanting to take you into their groups imo.
---
Im a banana!
---
Nah, he fine. My hunter lvl 60 is no pet no ranged lifestyle. Melee 2H ONLY. He does rly well as dps and support heals
---
Playing on private servers, some guilds, mostly chinese guilds would gladly invite dps ret and gift them Nightfall, to buff the rest of the magic dps. Was it a recruitment strat? or were they finding a group of dps players left behind? Nightfall is undoubtedly a fine ret weapon, and on allys side a weapon with few other efficient wielders. Something to think about.
---
this got me, id might want to copy and share it got me good 
---
I'm pretty sure that's the point they were trying to make, there's plenty of quests to level, but not in each individual zone, you have to change zones and the "push button recieve reward"-type of gamer playing retail wont accept that.
---
The guild I joined when I spent some time on alliance had a gnome MT. I'll admit, it was fun killing time in 5mans just watching him hop and twist while tanking.
---
I have a feeling im not going to decide what im going to play until the game comes out...and then ill probably regret not picking something else....
---
I want to play a warlock, but i also really want to play a Dwarf :(
---
Source? i didn't know, you're right.
---
Why are you refusing to consider a perspective that differs from yours? There's a gameplay element that many of us find quite enjoyable that would be compromised by balancing the specs. Sinking weeks kitting out a niche build the developers obviously never anticipated we roll with just to make it barely viable is a very fun proposition to many of us.
---
Look, TBC was a lot of fun for me. I mained a raiding balance druid. The class balancing made moonkins strong enough to justify bringing one to all but the most hard core raid groups. That was a great time for all specs wanting to be competitive in PVE content. The downside was that there were no specs in TBC that were anything like the niche builds in D2, such as melee sorceresses.
---
There's a whole avenue of gameplay that we'd miss out on if Blizzard rebalanced the specs. It's fine if _you_ aren't interested in that gameplay. Just be honest: you want to take that style of gameplay away from us because you want to have an easier time maining them.
---
Yeah I know, but if you would go meleeing down mobs it would be the go to specc. Crit chance for raptor and mongoos and deterrence and counter attack. But yeah, you better of solo with mm/survey then only surv. Which is what the op asked originally. Survival is also used alot for pvp, getting deterrence and counterattack procs vs melees is nice
---
It's a good 6-10 days of /played to reach 60 and even more time to get ready for raiding.  If your time is that limited, the raid scene is likely out of reach.  But the good news is that vanilla WoW is much more about the journey and there's plenty of fun to have along the way.  Not to mention you have your Dungeon Set 2 to collect at your own pace when you finally do reach max level.
---
Find a casual raiding guild.  Progress will be slow, but it's about enjoying the journey, not getting to the destination as quick as possible.
---
I've played exclusively on PVP servers during Vanilla and have never seen this happen as Alliance, and i killed this guy a fair few times. And none of the realms i played were very heavily biased towards Alliance. 
---
Plenty of PvP in Tanaris but it's not really the same level of PvP that's in STV.  It's easy to escape PvP in Tanaris. It's not in STV.
---
Maybe I read your sentence wrong but it has usually been my experience that Alliance on average has much quicker bg que times than Horde because there are usually less Alliance players queing. Who's lore do you like better and who do you see yourself as at 60 is what I personally would use to determine who to start as though.
---
I agree, Horde has much better pvp racials and thus longer pvp queues
---
Yeah I guess in retail you can stay in just 1 zone or something like that? I haven't played so I don't really know how it works nowadays.
---
I'm not sure if that's going to be enough to make people quit, wouldn't it be nice to travel the world and change zones so you don't get bored?
---
Pre 60 i would say druid, not very gear depending. Pally is preBC very hard because you don't get mana from heals

Well i said on average. Sometimes i might only get to play 2-3 hours on a sunday and then not at all the other days of a week or 4+ hours every day in the week and able to do a 12 hour gaming session on a weekend. It's all dependant on what is happening and what my girlfriend puts up with haha. It can really vary.
---
I just remember playing for like 8+ hours a day in the week and like 30 hours over a weekend back when i was 15 to even be in my raiding guild.
---
It's not that bad. As a feral tank i can get pretty high in dps. If we're fighting 3-4 enemies at a time and i just spam maul/swipe then i might just rival decent dps players.
---
I missed the initial vanilla release by two or three months so I can't talk about that.
---
However I rolled on three private servers at their release in the last few years. 
---
As an undead mage it was unplayable. By the time you finished a cast that mob was already tagged. Literally every 5-10 yards was a player attempting to tag the mob as it spawned. It took me around 10 hours to get out of the starting zone. This was without dynamic respawns. 
---
As a NE hunter on a server with dynamic respawns the situation wasn't nearly as bad. I was able to make it to Darkshore in the first day. However there were lines for quest items that could take upwards of 30min if you wait in line. That underwater quest off shore? Yeah don't drown. Dynamic respawns made other quests practically undoable. The quest in the coven or cave thing was impossible even with a group of 5 it was a challenge. 
---
Personally, I'd rather have super long queues.
---
10.0 yards ≈ 9.1 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

Female orcs more manly than most males. Look badass in armor 
---
Sounds like you need to get your girlfriend to play Classic WoW too.
---
I am thinking of going prot warrior and collecting dps gear in dungeons when the dps doesn't need it.
---
I love the lore, quests, ease to find groups and tanking in general.
---
Only question remains; alliance vs horde, race and profs. But that also depends on what an old timey friend wants to roll
---
You have the time to be in a decent casual guild but I would highly recommend against playing the role of a tank .
---
Being the most crucial role it's important that your tanks are consistent players that you can count to show up week in and week out. If not you're likely to get replaced by someone else who is. 
---
Tanks also use a lot of consumes and need to keep up to date on gear/enchants. 
---
You would be much better off as a healer imo. 
---
If you are seriously concerned abotu your time commitments, you almost certainly cannot be a main tank in a raiding guild of any sort of caliber. While almost any other role is easily fillable, the raid can't just fill for you if you and your wife decide its date night instead of raid night on a random Tuesday.
---
So being main tank is almost certainly out of the question, but you can certainly play a warrior and gear up your tank gear and be an off-tank when the opportunity presents itself.
---
I had a hunch, but it's been too long since I quit playing...
---
Thanks for enlightening this old fool.
---
&gt;It was one of the single most requested features back in the day and it was glorious when it finally arrived. I could heal and still have fun with Enhance on my Shaman? Yuuuuus 
---
How's easy mode retail working out for you?  Maybe you should go back there and farm more asserrite.
---
The problem mainly is i feel that Blizzard sees the Vanilla WoW with queue's and the lag / crashes as a (big) faillure. And they have stated that its not something they want to repeat. 
---
Now for a subset of players queue's will be a acceptable or even preferred solution. However for other players it won't be as a lot of players hate queue's (every time there is one, its sure to cause an outrage on the forums). It doesn't seem there is a solution that will please all player. So they need to find the least impact full method to have a good launch, and if we like it or not, that could very well be sharding. 
---
Alerac Valley is the only thing that matters. If it isn’t Alterac Valley, it doesn’t count.
---
It's possible, but the hard thing is to find a spot to be a main tank, there will be a shitload of warriors who wants to be the MT.
---
Naxx will most likely not happen tho.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Haha, Oh i wish. But it's just not for her im afraid. 
---
Idm people playing meme specs, but hiding behind "fun" when having a terrible performance is just fucking retarded. Assuming what I'm getting from these pictures are right, you were being a leech, something no one likes
---
Definitely helpful in theory. Lots of other factors that prevent this from being super conclusory though. For example weapon availability - through the 20s there are very few decent 2 handed warrior weapons, but then the whirlwind axe will be your best weapon for a PRETTY long time. 
---
Thank you for sharing this with us!
---
It would be awesome if this could also factor into account what the XP is if you are in a group of 2, 3, 4 or 5 people.
---
I rolled on Thunderlord day 1, which ultimately turned out to be a medium population realm.
---
I don't specifically recall how many people there were, but there were a lot, and for the first week or two I almost always had to wait in a queue to get in
---
Servers have limits, yes. But those limits are VASTLY higher than they were in 2004.
---
The only excuse Blizzard has for not being able to support 10k+ on a single server (like pservers are able to these days) is shit optimization. Which arguably isn't even an excuse and more of a sign of incompetence. The question is, will they go out of their way to optimize their retail server code, which we know from experience is super unoptimized for some reason (can't even handle 30v30 battles) or will they just leave it as is, and throw in sharding to compensate for their deteriorated server performance. 
---
But honestly given their recent track record of cost-cutting I have serious doubts they'd be willing to (partially) rewrite their server-code. Given the current state of things, sharding is the more likely scenario. So people are right to be super wary, skeptical, and frankly, pessimistic. Sharding IS gamebreaking for a lot of people including myself. Calling people 'dumb' for wanting an authentic experience isn't going to change that. If I see one player sharding away in STV that's an instant 'nope' and 'back to pservers' for me personally.
---
The main hardships of your warrior choice are going to be keeping your equipment up to date is going to be solo leveling. Try to find a priest/druid/shaman to group with who can off heal you during the leveling process. 
---
In addition, it’s very important you’re upgrading your weapons at every opportunity, even if that means you’re spending a lot of gold. It’s crucial to a warrior for leveling. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
For shaman PVE, the only “meta” spec is resto, you are correct. However there are plenty of guilds who will still take on off “meta” specs. It may not be “hard core” but there is no rush to clear content, Classic is not going anywhere like a private server. I think it’s more important to enjoy your class than worry about clearing content within a month of it being released. 
---
For shaman PVP, every spec is completely viable. It’s where shaman really shines. 
---
You think Blizz intentionally locked out half of all specs from any endgame content? Clearly not on purpose, they just didn't do the math.
---
Well if raid days are set in advance it's not an issue for me. If i know when stuff will be i can always restructure stuff, And i usually know my schedule at least 2 weeks in advance. Plus if i said i have already committed to turning up to 39 other people my girlfriend would actually understand. Even though she's not a gamer she knows a promise is a promise haha. Maybe i'm just clutching cause i want to relive my raiding in vanilla haha! If not there's always playing a scummy mage :)
---
Way to misrepresent a point everone knows you're capable of understanding
---
If you're willingly being useless, you dont deserve gear, regardless of class. Playing ret and slacking, getting out dpsed by tank, and not providing other forms of utility? Fuck off loot ban. Half asleep mage not casting a lot of spells, not even sheeping etc? Fuck off loot ban
---
Like if you enter a pug expecting to get loot when afking as you would in a lfr, then you can get out and get bent frankly
---
You posted in the wrong sub again..
---
r/WoW is that way ---&gt;
---
Is shadow priest consider meme spec, I really want to raid as shadow but if I wont get a spot I have no problem healing. I want to shadow in PVP but fear the re-spec cost to keep switching is impossible (I play 10 hours a week).
---
bro obsidian edged blade will out dps dal rends.
---
Then I wouldn't stress about it too much, and if you wanna play warrior I'd roll warrior. I don't really think not being in full pre-BiS gear by the end of the first month is going to prevent anyone from raiding.
---
&gt; The only excuse Blizzard has for not being able to support 10k+ on a single server (like pservers are able to these days) is shit optimization. Which arguably isn't even an excuse and more of a sign of incompetence.
---
I understand your stance but that's just wrong. Blizzard never had THE NEED to re-write their whole netcode to allow for these numbers. YES, this is part of "optimization" but we're not talking about a couple of hundred man-hours to do this, we're talking BIG BUDGET hours to re-write the whole netcode for a game like WoW.
---
As far as classic and raids and stuff is concerned, we'll likely be able to see few hundred people battling each other but we will also experience lag. It will pretty much be like the first days in Arathi Highlands dailies for warfront but will occur with higher numbers than currently on retail.
---
It's sad but that's likely not going to be avoided.
---
Well said
---
You have to decide if you're more motivated by aesthetics or class mechanics. Nobody can help you with that.
---
It still doesn't answer the question, why doesn't he have to contribute like the rest of the raid does? The boss died because everyone else picked up his slack.
---
I can also vouch for this. Druids are not often main tanks in raids, however they are excellent off-tanks and great at tanking instances. 
---
I dont mind playing "for fun", but this is over the line..
---
Yes? That's literally the point of having talents/specialization in the first place...
---
Some are good at leveling, some farming or pvp or raid dps or dungeon utility etc. 
---
Where do you people get the idea that every. single. class. should be able to fill a competitive dps role in raids? 
---
[That's what it's like out here, man.](https://i.imgur.com/vV9zj.gif)
---
Dwarf shadowpriest?
---
SP is really strong in Vanilla.
---
Yeah of cause, but it appears he was dpsing in that fight. A druid decursing, or what have you, will not be seen as a dps in that fight. I am not impressed. 
---
Meme specs don't even have the chance to compete + you can tell if someone is trying or not.
---
Do you want to look at a man's ass, or woman's ass for the 10+ days getting to 60?
---
You're the weird one
---
Nevermind, have fun playing with war mages rogues and priests !
---
#cleanClassic
---
Share to your hearts content.
---
Low to mid 30s stopped my progress on A LOT of alts, and I'm sure it will be the biggest graveyard for tourists.
---
The 20s can be a little uncomfortable but there is still enough to do and enough fun instances (at least for horde in WC, SFK and BFD) through the 20s that it is easy to keep playing.
---
In the low 30s though, quests are suddenly.. VERY scarce. You don't really know what you are supposed to do next. On PVP severs, the lvl 30+ zones are your first experience in truly contested zones, where the other side is just as present as your own faction.
---
Plus, time to level increases from about 2-3 hours to 3-6 hours, with a hell of a lot of travelling around continents to get shit done.
---
Just my opinion. A lot of the most casual of tourists will probably get to 10-12 and get bored but I'd imagine the 30s is going to be where a lot of people otherwise interested get culled out.
---
You seem to be pretty set. I would say go with whatever floats your boat. With regards to professions, I would strongly advise Blacksmith as Warrior scales with gear. But again, it's whatever you fancy.
---
Most people have probably heard enough stories to know to avoid it if possible.
---
Dude I feel you! I really wanna play hunter but I also want to play undead. I never understood why undead (and humans) couldn't be hunters pre cata.
---
Sorry, but ypu probably can catch a pug here and ther on weekends, but it takes an upfront investment to get enough traction to be able to join an effective raid group. 1-3 hours every day will get you to 60 in three to nine months, so lets say best case four months. Then you can start farming preraid bis for another 1-3 months. Moreover, the whole process will be less convenient because it has to be pugged most likely. I’d say six months after launch, you will be ready for mc in most people’s eyes...
---
How dare you talk about retail WoW on this sub in any way except shitting on every aspect of it? 
---
Eat those downvotes!
---
Eh, we're still around.  We left BC many moons ago, though.  Some of the long time members have moved on but still duck in to say hi from time to time.  Unfortunately Alliance raid scene is dead and the majority of us don't want to transfer for the 75th time, and most of us have moved on from anything "hardcore".
---
Had over a dozen people at BFA launch and a bunch more ready to restart, that lasted less than a month lol.
---
I was there at day one. I wasn't happy. It was laggy, took a while to complete some quests, crashes, etc.
---
However, I meet most of the people I would play with for next 5 years during these first few days. And that I would not trade for a bit more stable realm.
---
&gt; I understand your stance but that's just wrong. Blizzard never had THE NEED to re-write their whole netcode to allow for these numbers. YES, this is part of "optimization" but we're not talking about a couple of hundred man-hours to do this, we're talking BIG BUDGET hours to re-write the whole netcode for a game like WoW.
---
I know it'd most likely be a huge undertaking to change their architecture, I might not have made that clear enough in my post.
---
What I was trying to say is that that fact just makes sharding all the more likely, unfortunately. 
---
As you said yourself, lag in classic is pretty much guaranteed in certain situations given their current server-tech. (STV, city raids, guild fights over world bosses, etc.)
---
This worries me because I feel like there's a good chance that Blizzard is going to see this lag be like: 'Ok this is not an optimal experience for players, let's throw in a little sharding JUST here to help alleviate the load.' 
---
I played a warrior in vanilla.
---
Your hardships are going to be the obvious leveling difficulty. Herbalism or no.
---
Being weak in PvP without a healer, Losing duels, Pressure to tank, slow farming.
---
Of course, all of this will change IF you get geared. But the thing most people don't tell you is just how fking long that gear drought is.
---
I was in t2/t1 with drake talon cleaver by the end of vanilla and tbh I was only just able to do things solo listed above. I think reddit makes it sound like the game is fast paced and you'll be 60 and geared up in no time. But you really are spending a good amount of days played being weak.
---
It seems like private servers have convinced people the game is now easy and everyone will be running around in epics from day 1. But I remember being one of the more geared warriors on my server (probably top 75%) and I felt weak until the very end of that 2 year grind.
---
Adding more warriors won't fix that.  People don't want to tank because tanking is stressful.
---
&gt; Took time to learn the class. 
---
You mean they learned how to spam 1 spell for 8 minutes straight?
---
Name checks out.
---
NaM ?
---
Souka
---
This is a very good point. The only thing I’d add is that the difference between playing as a female while male and playing as a troll while human is that there really are females in real life (and playing the game) but there are no real trolls.  So, playing a female avatar is kind of like digital crossdressing which is a real thing, and has a real world analogue, wheras everyone understands that trolls and orcs and dwarves are make believe characters that exist only within the confines of the game. 
---
That said, if you see the character entirely as a separate established entity, then I can see how this is not the case, as no one considers Lara Croft their avatar as she is an established character who the player guides, but she isn’t really a stand-in for the player, she is who she is independent of the player. In WoW, however, you play as your own self made character and not an established character like Thrall or Sylvannas so it’s more conducive to creating an avatar.
---
elf paladins existing isn't weird in the slighest, especially with dwarf paladins being a thing.  elves are the priest unit in wc3 so they already have a significant link with the light; humans training elves in the paladin arts makes sense.  the blood knight fantasy is actually pretty neat when you consider the existence of 'pure' high elf paladins prior to arthas' destruction of quel'thalas
---
Disagree entirely. BFA in particular taught the lesson that if you wait until the game hits alpha/beta it is too late and all major features are going to be pushed to live. Nu-Blizzard does not allow their pre-planned development cycle to be disrupted by negative player feedback to features.
---
The only hope for players to influence the process is to get their views out while major decisions are still being made behind closed doors. Nu-Blizzard might not back down regardless, but if you wait for beta it’s too late. Betas today are about marketing - not big fixes or player feedback. The purpose is to get a buy decision from the consumer before the general public can get their hands on the game. 
---
Getting bad changes averted or publicly cancelled is infinitely more difficult due to dev ego and the impact removing the feature has on the overall game. The time to lobby is before disastrous changes get locked in to the development cycle and the bureaucratic decision-making apparatus at nu-Blizzard. Intelligent players will continue to make their voices heard concerning their vision of Classic WoW, on this and any other available forum.
---
A rotting female body just has a certain *je ne sais quoi* about it.
---
Did I say that out loud?..
---
You must not have done dungeons much. I saw 7 world drop epics at least on my only 60.
---
But this cursed me as I was never able to get my Foror's.
---
Ive read that its not *that* bad, but honestly healthstones kind of make me not want to roll a warlock.  Manually making/trading for each one, and having to fill your bags with shards just doesnt sound particularly fun.
---
I'll have fun with druids &amp; paladins too, just not as dps :)
---
Dude people on this subreddit are vastly exaggerating. Play whatever you want. I just dinged 60 with my warrior on a p-server and I switched to dualwielding right at lvl 20 and couldn't spot any difference in kill times. Had no trouble whatsoever. Only thing you have to worry is a somewhat decent mainhand weapon.
---
As a warrior most of the time you will face mobs the same level or below your character anyway so missing hits aren't really an issue, especially if you're orc and have axes or equivalent class/weapon combo. When it comes to dungeons however you will experience more misses with dualwielding because mobs are higher level and elites.
---
 If you wan't to do dungeons often as dps go 2h, otherwise dualwielding is perfectly fine for leveling.
---
You may be shocked to learn that you’ll still be able to meet people in Classic, though. Possibly even more than if the realms were unstable, in fact. So the false binary just seems false. 
---
Happened to me with T1 helm. 7/8. Then some rando warrior standin outrolls me. 
---
The logic for me rolling wad that I already had t2 shoulders. So I couldn't argue.
---
Because the rest of the raid was OK with it. Does that answer the question for you?
---
Shadow has issues in raids, doesnt it?  Debuff slots/(maybe?) mana issues?
---
I remember blacksmithing being a pretty tough grind, but some items were BiS for Fury... It is food for thought :) 
---
Never thought of it being handy while leveling, you are right!
---
So as someone who is still waiting for the coffee to kick in, is it better to be below the mob or above the mob in levels.
---
As a 2/8M Boomy I had no idea I was a "Meme-Spec" I sim at 18.5k DPS quick sims and routinely sit at top 5 on the meters, plus all the utility I bring along. This is news to me.
---
Beautiful &lt;3
---
Shadow in group PvP is average at best since it is so vulnerable to cleanses/dispels. While solo it's definitely a beast, though but is vulnerable to getting outscaled (since little raiding gear will come to you). 
---
Same could be said about the rest: 1v1? Rather fine. Group? Besides ele shaman everything else is better as healer. And ele as an offheal-supporter with burst. 
---
You're acting like fun isn't a factor.
---
My bad, my comment wasn't directed at you and more to people you described leveling a spec not knowing how they perform in endgame.
---
What? Maybe for allies, as I've never played one, but for Horde you can just go to desolace and do 32-35 very easily. It's one of the last long, smooth leveling experiences in the game IMO; you just go straight from one quest area to the next with 2 decently large quest hubs and several smaller quest givers spread throughout.
---
The social meta game is an aspect of what made Vanilla compelling imo.
---
There is no mix of opinions.
---
There are the people that have fought to get this game back for 15years. No changes.
---
And then there are activision employees. Cheap and easy solutions ro re-ruin the game.
---
No sharding. No changes.
---
Just group up with the other people that are doing them and they are super easy + no people from the other faction would harrass you
---
This
---
Classic launch was nothing like modern private server launches. Vanilla servers had 2.5-3.5k population caps, or approximately 200-500 players per starting area averaged out. It was definitely crowded, but not "form groups and stand on top of this one respawn"  overcrowded. You could quest functionally albeit with heavy competition. The queues, crashes and server downtime during vanilla launch on the other hand are a totally different story. Fuck that shit.
---
I know we’re older now and we’re trying to optimize time spent playing the game but analysis of numbers like this takes away from the vanilla experience. The whole point is not to treat the game like a second data analyst job lol. 
---
I was thinking Druid, as well.  Especially if she plays rogue, questing will be easy.
---
I think titan bars does exactly this
---
#keepClassicClean
---
At 60 I have no problem healing, I just want to make leveling as smooth as possible.
---
I'd u want to make meme specs work in vanilla you have to go the extra mile, which will make it more along a job.
---
Not if half the people I meet questing aren't in the same shard.
---
It feels very fantasy-like to me. At least for the first few patches Warlocks will play more of a support-DPS class. You are buffing other people's damage and all of that. 
---
Also, you won't have to pass everyone a HS, just for the tanks mostly. People will expect a summon or two, SS to be on the healer and HS for the ranks at best and that's it. 
---
Yes? You specialize. You don't see rogues complaining they can't play subtlety in raids do you? Or that Sapp and it's talents are useless in a raid?
---
It's the whole point of having talents, they are good for different things.
---
Its a Naga, not a sea giant that drops the Tidal Charm.
---
 Cool list though
---
I'm very certain it doesn't as iv been using through out my private server career.
---
Mind linking what you mean?
---
I have addons taht tell me xp per kill and how many till i level up .... but not which level is the most efficient to kill 
---
Yes but melts face in pvp
---
&gt; unfortunately I became MT, raid leader, and guild leader due to a series of unfortunate events which ended up stressing me out a bit 
---
haha same here. I work only as a leader. If not the leader, I'm that "retarded".
---
&gt;If you only use the second formula, you already have a "divide by 2" when both players are on the same level.
---
? I don't follow
---
The second formula is the one you use when they're -not- the same level, so why would you use the /2 part of the first one?
---
Skipper it seems like these colourful bars form some kind of a secret code..
---
male human...
---
Sweeping strikes for Arms Warriors was broken OP on launch.  I remember SM groups where I was 70% of the group's damage as the tank.  You would only consume 1 charge per ability you used regardless of how many targets you hit.  So you could Whirlwind and hit 4 targets twice each and it would only consume one charge.  It was also deliciously broken in BGs too.  If you Executed a target with Sweeping Strikes, it would deal Execute damage to a secondary target regardless of their health.  I recall using it to execute a clothie and one-shot their ally fighting next to them.
---
Draenei Shaman lore does kinda suck. BE Paladin lore is pretty spot on.
---
Thanks for your feedback man, it helped. Really appreciate it.
---
I got an email from backerkit on Oct 25, 2018 with a link to download the digital content.

---
STVietnam and Tanaristan, the two deadly PvP zones
---
STVietnam.. never heard that one before.
---
how is it exactly fitting?
---
Definitely part of it, it was just frustrating how some people really only went out for themselves instead of the team as a whole. Vanilla was also pretty cut throat though. I played a tank and once other guilds saw me hanging around org with tier pieces I'd get invites to better guilds quite a bit.
---
I'm leveling a enh shaman on a private server right now. Only level 30 so I haven't gotten Stormstrike yet. My question for you is this: wouldn't the debuff be consumed in like 2sec in a raid (assuming there are rogues using poisons)? Forgive my ignorance here. Regardless your proposed change makes more sense.
---
All I'm saying is there are casual players, people who play for fun. Just because classic wow is your job doesn't mean it is for everyone else. You can have fun and clear regular content even if you have no clue what you're doing.
---
Kinda popular vid, but maybe someone didn't seen it yet.
---
P.S. Warrior's Name Indalamar - blizzard recruit that guy to work with class balance things, since he was famous theorycrafter.
---
P.S.S. All items with "Ramalandi" in their name are named in favour of that guy.
---
I mean, I agree that doing less damage than the tank is unforgivable. I’m not certain the player in question wasn’t afk for half the fight. That doesn’t mean someone should be told they should be killed or spit on in this case. The person in the pic needs to get it together. The person in this comment thread was minding their own business. 2 different things imo.
---
You make macros for the pet that is combined with your attacks, which should make the handling easier.
---
Not if you group for them!
---
Not at all, afaik Blizzard has their own CFO and the guy who got fired started there 2017.
---
Bloodthirst wasn't in at launch in it's OP form. That was from the beta. 
---
It won't. Summer 2019 is too soon for the impact of a new CFO to make a huge impact. And even if he did start putting big changes into effect immediately, it would be focused on their big games. As much as ya'll want to imagine classic as the biggest thing ever, it's a small side project compared to the juggernauts of money things like HS, OW, and CoD are.
---
It’s a jungle where certain death lurks around every corner. Horde and alliance wage war here constantly as its a major leveling zone for both factions.
---
Oh Classic WoW is the only thing I don't want to badmouth Blizzard for. It's the only thing the haven't ruined SO FAR...
---
To be frank when they overthink loot trading and keep sharding only in starting zones and only at launch, It's pretty much the outcome I wanted and expected from official Blizzard Classic servers when I signed the petition. I expected them to put way less effort in this project to be honest and after the Blizzcon panel I was amazed how passioned the guys are about it.
---
Give old school runescape a shot if you can get past the point and click aspect, and graphics 
---
Which is the entire point of his and mines post. Unless you go the extra mile those specs are pretty bad. To make them work somewhat decently you have to spend a lot of time, time casual players don't have. Which is why he said it was good that threads like this exists so that casual players don't go into classic and expect to perform decent with these specs without doing research and farm a lot, which would lead to bad experiences and maybe them quitting the game.
---
Thanks for the downvote though when you don't even understand what we are saying.
---
I'm going to assume you're a troll but I'll answer for the sake of it and be done.

I said 'the most expensive arrows' meaning the normal ones you buy at level 40, wicked arrows, cost 10s per 200. In the 1-20 range a stack of arrows start at 10c and then something like 1-2s maybe at level 10.
---
In the level ranges people were originally talking about, roughly 1-20, you'll be getting anywhere from 2-3c per mob and up to maybe 1s per once you get closer to 20, assuming you get vendor items like claws or grey armor or cloth.
---
My point is, buying arrows isn't an issue for hunters in the slightest. As long as you top yourself off whenever you get back to town you'll never run out.
---
I had a fucking 19" CRT until 2010. 
---
aside from elites (2x) correct.
---
My horde buddies understand the plight of a brain dead enhance shaman hitting totems in the suppression rooms in raids. That alone is a reason alliance is better overall.
---
Ret is a shitty specc but Vanilla PvE is so fucking easy that everyone can play what they want. There are enough Min-Maxers that play Rogue and Mage that do more than enough DPS.
---
Is it possible to avoid STV anyways? I think everyone should go through the pain of STV. If you can mentally survive that you might just make it to 60.
---
How do you know the rest of the raid was ok with it? They very well could have been complaining too and it not just be in the screenshot.
---
I have never played horde before but all my friends are going horde in this classic version I have also only ever played pally since classic I’m having a hard time figuring out what I want to play my friends are playing a warrior , priest, shaman and a hunter so I feel like I should jump into the mage or warlock role which I’m excited about but I don’t know the mechanics of either class and i will feel weird with out have the ability to heal 
---
Help me decide what class to play and what race goes best with that class 
---
Thanks 
---
100% of a downed server or a queue is zero people met. 
---
I mean, not really.  
---
Every raid I was in would always ensure at least one spot went to a SP.
---
Because he wasn’t kicked. Unless you’re just going to claim he was kicked. 
---
Name of character? You said bronzebeard? Which guild?

&gt;  I want to run stuff like MC, AQ40
---
I hit 60 on a private server over Christmas with 11 days /played since November.  As it was the holidays I played every day and am now up to 17 days /played
---
Within a few days of hitting 60 I was in ZG and MC pugs - admittedly some pugs rejected me for having bad gear, but I bought some T1 pieces of the AH and that helped.
---
I now have 2 pc t2, 5 pc t1 and some other epics eg wavefront necklace and hide of the wild.
---
Admittedly my private server has a very high population, overpopulated compared to official servers and joining the server late means many guilds and pugs already have BWL on farm.  The holidays also meant several guilds needed pugs to fill the raids.
---
The point is there will always be hardcore raid guilds and less hardcore
---
&gt; but the hard thing is to find a spot to be a main tank, there will be a shitload of warriors who wants to be the MT.
---
On the pvt server I play there is a severe shortage of tank spec warriors, to the extent tanks can charge to run dungeons and reserve items like righteous orbs
---
Most warriors are now dps specced leather wearing
---
Current wow and classic wows class design/philosophy is different enough that I can't see people getting worn out from playing BFA, but that's just me. I think with class quests, having to gather soul shards, talents, ect even the class you have played every day in current wow will feel fresh.
---
I seem to recall it not being all that difficult to outdamage DPS as a warrior tank. Near Infinite rage can translate to a lot of DPS.
---
&gt; Whoa, what? Mind blown.
---
Unblow that mind! He's incorrect. XP is calculated as:
---
XP = (Char Level * 5) + 45, where Char Level = Mob Level
---
So a level 10 mob, killed by a level 10 character will give X = (10*5) + 45 --- or 95 xp.
---
For Higher Level mobs:
---
XP = (Base XP) * (1 + 0.05 * (Mob Level - Char Level) ), where Mob Level &gt; Char Level
---
For Lower Level mobs:
---
XP = (Base XP) * (1 - (Char Level - Mob Level)/ZD ) where Mob Level &lt; Char Level, and Mob Level &gt; Gray Level
---
The only thing that really changes things is elites, which are xp*2
---
That guy was single-handedly responsible for the trash tier state of warriors at release, the patch after this video applied dual-wield hit penalty to 2 handers (this change was reverted in 1.2)
---
You can avoid most of it. There are tons of questing areas. Also lots of people tend to head right to STV as soon as they're able and that's a recipe for pain. I'd rather spend a level or two in STV as a higher level character than go right at level 30 and suffer for 15 levels. I wouldn't be surprised if it was possible to avoid it almost entirely. On my current character I'm only stopping by when I have a couple delivery quests.
---
That's called Zero Difference level, ZD
---
ZD =  5, when Char Level =  1 -  7
---
ZD =  6, when Char Level =  8 -  9
---
ZD =  7, when Char Level = 10 - 11
---
ZD =  8, when Char Level = 12 - 15
---
ZD =  9, when Char Level = 16 - 19 
---
ZD = 11, when Char Level = 20 - 29
---
ZD = 12, when Char Level = 30 - 39
---
ZD = 13, when Char Level = 40 - 44
---
ZD = 14, when Char Level = 45 - 49
---
ZD = 15, when Char Level = 50 - 54
---
ZD = 16, when Char Level = 55 - 59
---
&gt; A lot of your expectations are... off. There seems to be a general misunderstanding about RP servers and how they operate,
---
Personally I find the whole conversation as kinda gate keeping because of this. I just thinks its arrogant to think you are the arbiter of what and how people should RP, much less even be in a position to tell others how they should RP. I hate the whole "your wrong and let me explain why" type post
---
&gt; the biggest problem I see on this subreddit regarding sharding is that people don’t actually know what it is
---
You mention it might help on log in queues but sharding won’t affect queues, crossrealm does. How about understanding them yourself?
---
&gt; but you can pull a lot more mobs anyway 
---
Ha ha no you cant. Fury/arms take way less damage than prot when they kill mobs way faster.
---
Warlocks do have some heal-ish abilities (healthstone, drain life, etc). You might find that more appealing than Mage which has plenty of escape mechanisms (Polymorph, Frost Nova, Blink, etc), but no self-healing options.
---
As a Horde Warlock, you'll be able to hand out Healthstones to all your buddies in addition to summon people if you've got two others with you. That's pretty handy. Your Voidwalker can also serve as an off-tank in instances and can solo-tank for you when you level on your own.
---
As far as races, the Orc racials are pretty great overall (well, the 25% stun resist mainly), as is the Undead's Will of the Forsaken (useful in PVP and PVE). I don't think you can go wrong with either of them, to be honest.
---
Yes and no. A mages kit is a mixed bag of tricks. If you’re asking for FPS rotation, sure. But a mage gets exponentially more versatile and interesting as they level 1-60 comparatively speaking to current modern WoW. More so than anything, it’s also ranks of spells and gear progression. 
---
Coming from a person who played as mage through wotlk and tried one right as BFA released, the prospect of my fireball or frostbolt having a forever linear climb made things... miserable and uninteresting. There were no ranks, so at no point did your abilities seem to have a “larger/noticeable” increase. This coupled with  blue/green gear just having progressive stats (or for people with heirlooms, their gear just gained stats every level), there never felt to be a power shift or real increase, it felt like a creep.
---
So yes, Classic is exponentially better in this regard. 
---
Typically, anything yellow is fine. +2 only gives 10% more xp so not too much of a benefit, and -2 can vary from -15% to -40%
---
But realistically, if you can kill it, kill it. What's better, making a kill for 60% xp or getting 0 xp?
---
Discovering the world for the very first time.
---
This buckled me with laughter and a few real tears :'(
---
Could someone please make this story into a machinima, with Fortunate Son as soundtrack?
---
It will probably take you a while to get to 60 and geared for raids. However, I’d try to find a good guild that understands your time constraints and doesn’t mind bringing you along when you are able. If you have a good rep in your guild it should be fine. You could also look for the pug raids forming up. Those always need tanks. That’s if you’re still planning on tanking. This time around I’d focus on dps with a tank set since it’s unlikely you will be a guilds main tank. Best of luck to you!
---
what you dont account is that while leveling you fight different level of mobs, and your dps will be different depends on what you are fighting, and 2h is better for fighting higher level mobs than your level mobs. 
---
warriors are extremely sensitive to level of mobs compared to their level. due to glancing blows mechanic and misses. all of which affects rage generation massively and snowballs even more either for increase or decrease of the damage. 
---
warriors are all about working around glancing blows. thats why you  do so much more damage to green mobs, and seemingly do much less damage to mobs even 1 levels higher than you, nvm +2 or +3 lvl mobs.
---
Before I quit during Wrath I bought a Forers for 1500g on my server and solo'd the level 60 version of onyxia on my prot paladin. Was pretty fun. Glad I had a chance to solo onyxia a few times before they turned it into a level 80 raid.
---
- Group of 2: *0.5
---
- Group of 3: *0.388
---
- Group of 4: *0.325
---
- Group of 5: *0.28
---
Assuming your group is all the same level, just take each cell and multiply it by these.
---
Group of 5 level 40s killing a level 40 mob will get 28% of it's xp each.
---
You have PTSTV
---
Honestly, I'm a slow leveler and I didn't want to play on a private server to retain the overall experience. I would expect there are a lot of other people that are just waiting for the authentic experience.
---
You know how the highest damage rotation for mage goes ?
---
I want to tank as a warrior but I hate shields how viable can I be using a staff 
---
My guess is there will be a lot of players like you in Classic. Me included. My hope is that there will be plenty of guilds with loose requirements, but filled with players wanting to raid and commit to it - just with less time commitment. When we have an actual launch date, it’s time to start looking after those likeminded people and form a guild/community! Good luck and have fun!
---
Agreed with this guy. Might be hard to get a permanent raid spot as a tank, though. 
---
If you do want to raid (let's say 1 night a week, which is totally possible) you might be better off as a DPS, or maybe a healer, since those are more interchangeable. 
---
OH have same dodge/miss etc crit chance as MH. Overpower is better for 2H weapons.
---
Also, you can't do 100% uptime Heroic Strike - you don't have enough rage for that. 
---
Also, if you're going Dual Wield, you will spec fury and you will loose tactical mastery(for most time), imp.Overpower, Anger Management, Deep wounds, Sweeping Strikes, Weapon specs.
---
While lvling dual wield is so bad, especially at PvP realms. 2H arms is the way you should go when lvling.
---
TBC lore sucked ass. Retcons out the ass, spaceships and goats.
---
if you mean bosslevel they are your level +3
---
if you mean unknown level they are simply deeper than red = 120%
---
Are you actually flexing and gatekeeping role playing?  Is this real life?
---
Yeah. I was thinking of looking for the same closer to the time. It's just figuring out what servers people are going to be on haha! 
---
Thank you for the feed back!
---
Haha that would be awesome, huh?
---
The beard poking out of that helm is even better 
---
&gt;His hands begins to glow instantaneously, before any interrupt can land, he casts Renew on himself. I shriek a sound I have never made before as I watch his health restore in large chunks back to 100%.
---
This! :D Without interrupt it's just mean.
---
Wiping on Princess Huhuran at 1% three attempts in a row because the server lagged out right at the end of the burn phase... Wait, I wont miss that at all!
---
Just.. streaming will happen and Blizzard will never even consider blocking it. People made youtube videos back in the days, do you think people put some random guy that was on screen for a second on their memory? No.
---
I have watched a few WoW streamers from time to time and every random person I see running past the streamer or whatever is forgotten the next second. Literally a non-issue and will never be even remotely addressed by Blizzard.
---
Isnt it even worse in an established group if somebody plays a fury warrior and does less DPS than a tank, because he can't be bothered to contribute to the core raid?
---
Why would anyone play with this person to begin with?
---
If somebody just casually jogs after the ball in team game when there is a counter attack of the opposing team going on, do you expect the other team member to want to play with him anymore?
---
Tough to answer man. But face the facts : balance drood, elem shaman, pala tank &amp; others specs used to not be played. So it's going to be the same for wow classic. But if you balance the game before it lauch, it's not wow classic anymore. 
---
I'm not sure, but i think they should touch the numbers carefully to makes more specs viable at 60+. If i know for sure that every god damn tank are going to be warriors, it's a bit less fun. In my opinion wow classic version 2019 will be very try hard compare to the "good ol times" so i wish some balancing will be put in the game. No new spells and stuff, just tweak the numbers.
---
Wow classic is more for me than just the raid aspect. It's also the travel time, the need for golds, the social aspect, the hard-time leveling and many things but classes balance. Man i was wondering last week "what will i play in classic?" No rogue / mage / warriors because it's like 50% of the server without balancing. I don't want to top the numbers, i want to be able to raid as balance drood without people calling me by birds names. I also know for sure that people have opinions, and not everyone will be happy.
---
Lol. Sharding and loot sharing?
---
I quickly mocked this up, but here is a combat dagger spec you can raid with and pvp with. You don't get deep sub tree perks, but you get the best of both worlds.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0gcoLZGcV0bEz0roV
---
&gt; I assume that Draenei shaman quests were also pretty different from Horde ones then.
---
They have different quests for their totems, but they're pretty much the same general spirit as the horde versions of quests as far as lore goes.
---
For your own sense of completion or for efficiency? 
---
For efficiency no, it's never worth it to run across a zone for a few quests. You're better off staying where you are and killing -1 or-2 level mobs
---
You’re not understanding my point. It’s not that the button pressing rotation is any simpler or more complex. Idc if modern WoW is pressing 8 keys and classic is spamming 1. 
---
I’ll still take classic. I’ll still enjoy the aspect of jumps and noticeable increases on my spells and abilities through ranks I earn from leveling or raiding/doing dungeons and acquiring gear that actually has noticeable differences amongst them compared to all being the same gear in essence, just with a different name and model. 
---
I would prefer a change to see player try a pre-nerd Cthun.    
---
"UnDefeated monsters in the wold make the world bigger and more real. They stimulate the economy, they create a buzz, they push players and guild to their max. All these things are important.   
---
I say release a near unbeatable version of each raid boss, you might be surprised what players and accomplish." 
---
Numbers weren't invented after 2006. This has always been part of the game. 
---
I plan to take a few days off work around it's release (probably a week or two after) and have warned my girlfriend i will be WoW playing for a few days like all day in those days (Maybe a long weekend) 
---
So i'm going to use that to accelerate a bit of my leveling. And yeah, I like tanking. I always play tank or healer in games if i can. Even in my WoW history my 3 big mains have been Prot War, resto druid and Holy priest. They just suit me more. 
---
Here's hoping there will be some cool guilds around that can slot me in :)
---
I would love to life in the same world as you do 
---
Yet, I had no problems meeting my friends.
---
It's fair for you to have your opinion, I'll just stick with mine and hope for a clean Classic.
---
No way, PM me the server since you can't type it out here. If there's 8000 concurrent players and no low-mid tier players, then they are faking that number without a doubt.
---
People are better at leveling nowadays, whats so surprising about that?
---
Amrita Ahuja is the CFO at Blizzard Entertainment
---
Yeah, my fear is that I end up on a server that is not populated enough and die out. I’m hoping that there will be some nice threads discussing servers later on to avoid ending up on a dead server.
---
^This is the correct calculation.
---
Often people have both average DPS in the raid and boss DPS. 
---
A mage in a Zul Gurub run has to:
---
\- sheep
---
\- AoE (alot)
---
\- single target DPS
---
There are significant differences between a good mage in a pug and bad ones.
---
It was still the 100% damage buff from kill until the talent rework. I believe it was nerfed to not have 100% crit chance after beta but it could still explode clothies.
---
Going into raids completely blind. Was in a high end raiding guild so whenever a new raid was released and we progressed through it there were no guides or strategies available since everyone kept them a secret. Nothing like that ahaaa moment when you figure out how a mechanic works and then you tweak your strategy accordingly.
---
People should see the weird shit guilds tried on patchwerk before hateful strike was figured out.
---
Also kinda funny how most people wound up with very similar strategies, many of which were not how the devs intended for players to kill the boss. Anub rhekan comes to mind.
---
Well, yeah, if you met them, obviously not. 
---
How many did you not meet because the servers were down or one of you was in a queue?
---
The idea that one won’t be able to meet people because of early sharding just doesn’t make any sense unless you expect shards of 1 player. 
---
I did say "arguably". I don't have much of a personal opinion here, other than admitting the fact that the desire of the game devs to share the 9th class with the opposite faction came first, and the lore around it was written after that as a justification, rather than being a creative idea in itself. This lore might be well-written, but it doesn't change the fact that it was shoehorned into Warcraft lore rather than being its natural extension.
---
Pala DPS is really, REALLY shit. 
---
If you have some +hit gear and T1/T2 and some  DPS items, because you are tanking ZG/AQ20 you will outDPS most meme/shitspecs easily.
---
I really appreciate the work you clearly put into this... I gotta ask though.
---
Why is 2h fury better than 2h arms from level 10-29? Are you thinking that 5% crit just carries the spec through the second tier? Because if you are planning to respec arms anyways for pvp zones, I can't imagine booming voice is good for barrens. 
---
What's the value you are getting here that makes it edge out arms?
---
Trying to avoid servers with streamer fanboys everywhere, That would wind me the hell up i feel haha. 
---
You fail to realize something like in modern WoW leveling 20-30, your frostbolt might have a gradual linear climb each level of doing 4 more damage than the previous for an increase of 40 over those 10 levels. That coupled with the mob level system they’ve put in means that movs progressively get more health, while I progressively do more damage. It cancels each other out and makes the grind pointless and boring. 
---
Take classic WoW. You’re level 27, you are trying to kite a level 30 elite mob (this would never happen now due to mob level scaling)... and you’re just struggling to get it done. You decide to do a dungeon and you receive a blue staff. This staff has stamina and a lot more int on it. So your Health increases by 150, and your frostbolts hit for more damage because of the large int increase (let’s say 10). You hit 28, and At 28 you get a new rank of frostbolt and now all the sudden your frostbolts cast for a larger chunk of damage, you can survive another hit or two and the mob is now yellow compared to orange/red.
---
That scenario is what made WoW and the grind and struggle of getting to 60 worth it. It’s also what is non existent in their current leveling formula. It’s why we don’t play. 
---
Found the loot-council communist.   
---
Here's an idea/philosophy:  
---
IF YOU DONT NEED THAT PLAYER DONT BRING THEM.  
---
IF YOU BRING A PLAYER, THAT MEANS YOU NEED THEM.    
---
ALL PLAYERS ARE NEEDED AND SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL CHANCE AT LOOT.   
---
If you remember a moonkin that was most certainly not vanilla.  Laser chickens were added in TBC.
---
With the way people do it on private servers with a Fury-specced dual wielding tank to keep up with the insane damage melee does, having a tank be in the top 10 damage for a fight is going to be pretty common. Once execute phase hits, they just shoot up the meters and only other fury warriors and rogues can consistently keep up.
---
Good one 
---
“Wow, did you see that guy in the background killing night web spiders?” said probably no one ever. 
---
Open your eyes lol. 
---
Well for sure. Everyone wants a tank and healer. I was talking about later on when you don’t have as much time like you said. A raiding guild needs consistency out of its raiders. If you can’t meet the raid schedule then you won’t be a main raider. Hopefully you can still be brought along when you can raid. There is always pugs though. 
---
Frostbolt is 36y range.
---
It’s a cliche but STV is what will really do it. That’s the first zone where you will have to deal with constant PvP. And even on a PvE server it’s the first place where you’re sharing mobs with the entirety of both factions.
---
The 30’s is also where your leveling pace falls off a cliff unless you know how to rotate questing between multiple zones.
---
Specifically on PvP servers STV will be a big punch in the mouth for people who are used to the pacing and QoL of retail.
---
I rather use other spells than frostbolts too without having a disadvantage. You know like a real rotation with proccs were you have to react ? Plan what you do and use your pet to cc which gives some of your spells bonus spell power ?
---
If you look at the census survey on this sub, the majority of people are in their late twenties/early 30s or older. I think most people are in a similar position as you (I know I am as well), and classic will have a good number of casual guilds for people who want to play again but can't commit the same amount of time we did as teenagers.
---
Lololol, copypaste :D
---
The professions litteraly have been going down the same hole since before tokens. I 100% believe your wrong on that. I think profession just so happened to get shitier because Blizzard has been against getting BiS through crafting for a while. 
---
My man
---
That was just geared fury in general. The beta version was a buff you got after a kill. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibh4SO5W4OU
---
This is what got it ruined. You used to be able to heroic strike for 3300+ after getting a kill.
---
I play on the most popular vanilla server now until a new TBC server launches and Im level 21 in Ashenvale and its a PVP fest everywhere I go.  Very curious to read where this guys plays.
---
Ret is absolutely terrible at keeping up the nightfall debuff, though. They don't have any spammable abilities or talents which increase attack speed. An off tank, fury warrior, or hunter would be far better if you want to essentially eliminate a dps spot for the debuff on bosses.
---
I just like the way females look more in general. My first character was a male nelf. I play female toons now though. I find the gear looks better. Plus, i prefer the spell animations so much more on females than males.
---
Yeah I'm practicing aoe pulling for when classic drops, so far I've gotten on average 5-6% xp per pull.
---
Why did you get downvoted? I’ll never understand some people’s thought process on downvoting.
---
There are plenty of people who aren’t activision employees who don’t want possibly 20 times more people dumped in possibly fewer running starting zones at launch. There are plenty of people who aren’t activision employees who see sharding as a less bad alternative to queues, dead servers after launch, and dynamic spawns. 
---
Saying there is no mix of opinion is factually incorrect and blatantly ignores the daily back and forth here on sharding. 
---
Thank you. Fixed.
---
Skinning isn't super worth it if you're just going to 30 or 40. It's after that when you start getting thick/rugged consistently that it starts making a significant profit, otherwise, it's pretty meh.
---
As a warlock you'll be ok, most of your gold is going to be spent on talents and grims, but for the most part you'll be fine on gold.
---
I still had dialup because my parents didn't want to pay extra money for broadband. Not everyone can afford to have the latest technology.
---
And if you cant have fun, because you have to bend over backwards just to get into the raid and then being skipped on when loot is being distributed.  You not contributing will not be very fun for most people.
---
Take enhancement shaman: their raid gearing has NOTHING to do with PvP gearing. Therefore an enhancement shaman will take lots of gear with +crit, die in a cheap + kidney shot in PvP, because hes only wearing rogue +crit leather. 
---
He wont have fun in a raid and the raid does not enable him to play enhancement. 
---
A warrior with decent gear will do more DPS in PvP than an enhancer around BWL. A warrior with windfury support of an elemental shaman will shit all over an enhancer 3shotting him.
---
Most players will just be disappointed and quit.
---
Just got the fiery retributer on my paladin. The proc both makes me giggle and frustrates as well. I love when the proc crits for a WHOLE 3 DMG but it kinda pisses me off it resists fairly often too. All in all, it's not bad because the +5 def.
---
Okay, then play a different class? Like warlock? Or go back to modern WoW and stop being a troll. 
---
My point remains the same. The leveling experience is exponentially better, due to valid reasons stated, than modern WoW. Some people may not like the grind and look for instant gratification elsewhere, but imo that’s why most mmo’s are failing and there are quite a few of us chomping at the bit to get back to some of the roots of why we all fell in love with the genre. 
---
Have a good day! 
---
Perhaps I should have expanded on my original thoughts. I meant more for running dungeons and raids, not overland activity. I think it's more of a cultural depravity than anything. You see streamers all the time berate and belittle people in real time with their viewers. Youtube videos couldn't do that.
---
Ive had great experience with my pserver.
---
It’s funny you say that. On my pserver i know a female who plays a make character and her husband plays a female character. I wonder if its just more aesthetically pleasing. 
---
Yeah, but that's not learning your class. That's just learning how to raid properly. Every class is responsible for their own niches, but this doesn't make the class any more or less complex.
---
This is a non-issue
---
There was no streaming but there was youtube content.  I don't think there is much of a difference.
---
Now we're just talking semantics...
---
I see the pros and cons of shardring. I just chose a realm whether good or bad without sharding. I have experienced the launch of vanilla, with its ups and downs, without sharding. And I still kept playing happily for more than 5 years straight.
---
I'm not against new tech, I just feel feel that sharding has more cons than pros.
---
Spamming shadowbolt is different why ?
---
I don't need someone to tell me what I remember thanks. I know that TBC class balance was much better than Vanilla.
---
Does not negate what I said though. Had me as ret, maybe another 1 as well and 1 moonkin in AQ40.
---
Contrary to what you believe, Vanilla mentality was way different than pservers apparently. And that's for the best.
---
You stare at your character instead of the stuff you are fighting?
---
The launch version was also a buff after you got a kill, it was just nerfed. It wasn't replaced with the later version of bloodthirst until 1.6 but his point about blasting clothies with the old bloodthirst was probably true. Just not literally 1 shotting them like he would've in beta.
---
What did you call him?
---
There were no moonkin in AQ40.  Its not some balance thing, the form literally didn’t exist.
---
As soon as you start to be hardpressed to get rid of +hit.
---
Warriors  get so much +hit gear flung at them later on that you will struggle to ditch the hit and go for crit/AP. 
---
Just titanics, lionheart, Chromatic, Don Julios, Onslaught, Onyxia neck give you enough hit for 2hand. Everything above that is access and you waste the stat that could to better crit/AP usage.
---
Raids being challenging
---
I thought the CFO was Armin Zerza.  When did that change?
---
Yes, not allowing people to play is an alternative to crowding. Whether it’s a viable alternative or not is the question. Can you list some of the games and vendors who purposefully keep people from playing their games when there is a technological solution to allow them to play?
---
Spot on man spot on. I managed to quest untill like lvl 36 on my warr in vietnam, spent the next 4 levels grinding mobs for gold for my 40mount. I swear on my life it was 100x faster to kill 1000 tigers and 1000 gorillas than it was to continously corps run to and from quest hubs. 
---
Similar.. on the one that rhymes with Fourth Sail. 
---
Mages are complete at level 28 aside from iceblock and clearcasting. No matter how you grind or dungeon, it doesn't change much after level 28.
---
Got it, I was admittedly 17 and dumb at the time.
---
If I'm not mistaken that gives you 7-25 hours pr week of gametime.
---
That's more than enough time to raid vanilla steadily.
---
And besides, you're in no hurry. The raid instances aren't going anywhere, and new ones won't take their place.
---
Finally, most players that will commit to Classic will average your age or old. I myself am was twentyfour when vanilla launched.
---
Just experiencing the world for the first time. First time seeing the Darkmoon Fair, first time in Booty Bay, or hell, first time walking into Stormwind, Ironforge, Orgrimmar. That anxiety you would get going into a MC or ony raid for the first time. 
---
&gt; I have played Ret a lot in WoW and while I would say the vanilla spec is totally viable if you put effort in
---
what was the biggest problem with ret raiding in vanilla wow?
---
I usually roll Male, unless the gear looks wonky because of their posture/model. In those cases I role a female.
---
Yup, the original comment talked about level 10 range which is why I assumed we're talking about low level arrows. No need to be an asshole because I missed 1 small word in your comment.
---
Also I never said buying arrows would be a problem, not sure why you're commenting on that.
---
I agree, essence of pure flame has a lot of uses with AoE pulls.  I would love this on my shaman to farm DME lashers.
---
I physically can't imagine something that matters less to me about classic servers tbh. 
---
If a Vanilla server day one had 200 people in a noob zone, for example, 200 people in a Classic noob shard would be a lot closer to replicating the Vanilla launch experience than dumping in way more than that, right?
---
Lol it's clearly a problem with game design. There's a reason why people shit on "memespecs" and it's all down to game design. If rogues sucked at dps, would you blame the community or design? If ret were given something useful at 31 instead of repentence, I doubt you'd see the hate because only a ret can bring that "something." Rets were common prior to the talent revamp because they brought Blessing of Kings. Repentence used to be in the protection tree. Consecration also used to be ret but was moved over to holy.
---
Are you trying to insinuate that there are no popular and successful games, **like Vanilla WoW,** that have server queues?
---
A small indie game called [Fortnite had server queues.](https://www.primagames.com/games/fortnite/tips/fortnite-why-am-i-queue)
---
When the battle royale mode game out, due to the extreme amounts of people trying to log in at the same time, Fortnite had login queues.
---
Login queues are a tried and true, absolutely standard solution for server congestion.
---
I'll take the OP´s statements at face value and voice my uninformed opinions on the matter.
---
The reasons might be:
---
1. The server has been active for a while, most people are on the F.R.E.S.H. train, trying to maximize their 60-time until the server goes down/the next fREsH server appears. 
---
2. The "casual/noobish" players might not be that prevalent on these types of servers as they are [unlicensed, emulated, "hard" to setup/find, illegal?, etc, etc].
---
Conclusion. The mid-level players will be more prevalent in Classic but I suspect they might not be as prevalent as in Vanilla. My reasoning is that the average player age and knowledge will be higher so that people will try to play with specific goals in mind instead of goofing around (which is ofc a perfectly fine thing to do). 
---
Since you stated on an already going private server we can assume a lot a players reached max level and the server doesn't have a huge population. In That case the main focus of the ah will be the max level items. On classic all of us will start from 1 so im guessing ah will have lower level items for a while. I for example want to play classic but i will only resub after the sharding will be deactivated and if Activision Blizzard doesn't screw it up. 
---
It's just how it is for a few reasons.
---
1-30 is a very casual experience. Zones aren't contested so no opposing faction to deal with and there are lots of quests in concentrated areas. When you finish one zone you walk right next door to the next. 
---
Once you hit level 30 things change real fast. You're now in contested zones and have to fight off not only other people your level but also high levels who just gank for fun. You can't just stay in one zones so you're going across the whole world from STV to Arathie to Desolace and back again. On top of that the levels themselves require more experience so rather than logging on and dinging after a 1-2 hour play session you actually only got half a level in that time.
---
So a lot of people really chill out and kind of stop leveling alts all together in their 30's. If you make it past level 40 it is because you are committed to hitting 60 and participating in the end game content. 
---
I think Archimonde is a big example of a problem people underestimate. It's not just about having enough servers, and enough hardware, it's predicting player behavior. You can spin-up 100+ servers, but most likely people will clammer onto a few that are already marked as "High" or "Full" population because people want to play on the premier servers and they feel population is the biggest indicator of that. 
---
You might have a smooth experience at Classic launch, if you happen to roll on a server that's not getting hit with the popularity snow-ball effect. And then you'll have to hope that your less-popular server is at least still lively and fun. It's a complicated issue, and I don't blame a company for wanting to address it. It's just going to be a matter of ensuring that sharding doesn't extend past launch. 
---
No. Please read what I wrote, not what you want to see.

Games. That. Had. Queues. On. Purpose. Rather. Than. Letting.  People. In. With. Capacity. They. Already. Have.

Show me your 2006 spreadsheet analysis. 
---
Dunno man, shaman tanks are legit, like just not at a high tier.
---
Tbh, prot pallies pull insane burst with aw/Sera. I can sustain 20-22k single target for like 20 seconds with the LF racial up too. If it's a low m+ or something in that case it's pretty reasonable to be outdps'd by a geared protadin on a boss fight. I hear prot warriors are kind of bonkers now too.
---
I imagine LFR fights only last a couple minutes too, and tanks can see big numbers on some of those fights.
---
December 30th 2019 is so close!
---
My Boomkin will head into MC with 1000 snowballs. They are made of fire, it has to work. 
---
That's funny you think there is going to be a beta. With all the cost cutting Blizz is doing, putting HoTS on maintenance mode and the release of mobile Diablo, why would you think there is going to be a beta? Blizz sure as hell hasn't mentioned anything about one.
---
Shit, did it say Australian Summer 2019?!
---
It's like picking Toad in Mario Kart. Just because I pick Toad doesn't mean I identify with being an androgynous mushroom person. Only an idiot thinks that way.
---
I never claimed any of those things. Please read my post more carefully.
---
I've been making my retail friends mad for years complaining that vanilla was the best wow. They always say it's just nostalgia. I'm just happy I finally get to do what Ive been wanting to do for so many years now.
---
I've spend entier afternoon in the deadmines
---
Heard this in Cartman's voice...
---
I was a launch player. Stood in line at midnight to get my copy.
---
Around Midnight to 1AM starter zones were densely populated, but not crazy like Private Server launches.
---
Now I went to sleep after a few hours and woke up and started playing again in the afternoon, but by then I was at Darkshore, and it was twice as packed in Darkshore as it had been in the starter area, so I can imagine starter area must have been pretty damn bad.
---
The lag was unreal too, you couldnt stay online. It got worse as the day went on.
---
Right? Like it's not just nostalgia, it's immersion, you actually felt like the class you played, there were actual choices that mattered, it doesn't matter that there was a best cookie cutter build, you could make a build that was fun and still functional. That's not even counting the fact that there actually was a finish line in sight, unlike it is now. There was gear that dropped, and that's it, not a fucking slot machine that you hope not only drops your gear, but have it titan forge and get the right mods.
---
Fighting higher level mobs does have more of a negative effect on dual wielding than 2hing, but the effect is negligible until fighting mobs 3+ levels higher.
---
Also 2h is not better at level 60 at any gear level. Debatably on par with dual wield as complete fresh just hit 60 with no dungeon gear or raid buffs.
---
I'm not saying there are no low level players. I'm saying that I suspect that there are far less low level players then there "should" be based on my experience playing way back in the day. I am wondering aloud weather or not this is a quirk of the private server meta or if my perception of how the game was is skewed.
---
I play on rymes with Fourth Sail so it's definitely not a dead server.  
---
You can clear BWL in like 45 mins once you form a guild of people that know what they are doing. We arent going to need 3 hours of raiding a night 3 days a week. IMO just find a quality guild with good players that has one of their likely 2 raid nights on a day you have off of work, and the other on like the last day of your work week. That will make accommodating raiding much easier.
---
Classes that felt like classes has been one of the things I missed the most. Ive mained a rogue since vanilla and dear god the disappointed I had when rogues started becoming a class with HotS. I was devastated to then find out basically every class began getting heals. Every class did dps. Nothing made sense anymore lol. 
---
I agree with everything else too. The game plain changed  completely while adopting a lot of really good things too but the game just wasn't the same anymore
---
Tbh, MC and ony pugs will happen on servers in time.  Most large guilds will run them eventually with sellibles/bindings reserved.  If you can get close to pre bis, you will he able to get invited and these raids are like LFR difficulty. A slow MC pug may take 2 hours. 
---
Interesting experience. I'm also on a private server right now that has around 5-8k concurrent players on at any given time and there are lowbies EVERYWHERE. The AH is well saturated and there is always someone to group with.
---
My private server group runs two servers. I accidentally rolled on their well-aged server and had a similar experience until someone pointed out that I was on the ded server and there were, in fact, only about 500 people online. Is it possible you are experiencing the same problem?
---
I think buying gold for money is cheating.  People who do it should be ridiculed by the community and shunned from participating in grouped content.  It circumvents the spirit of a persistent multiplayer game to boost your character through means outside the game.  I cannot deny people will buy gold and it is impossible to stop it 100%.  But I think it's fundamentally important Blizzard does not support it by providing an official purchasing channel to maintain a stigma that gold buying is wrong.
---
I agree the WoW token has been effective at significantly reducing spam from third party gold selling sites but players selling services for gold has never been more rampant.  A glance at the group listing board will show its littered with carry groups.  PuG raid groups are pretty much worthless to attend because all the good groups of players are running carry groups instead of mingling with the population at large.
---
Classic WoW will be a poorer community experience if the token is incorporated.
---
Nothing. I am simply asking if you guys agree and if you do do you think that this will also be the case on retail classic when it launches? 
---
Weapon availability and ease of leveling weapon skill is the main reason to go 2h over dual wield for sure, but it's not too hard to get good dual wield weapons. There are some key points where it is easy to get dual rare weapons such as the vanquisher's sword + sword of serenity/omen (alliance/horde) in the late 30s from dungeon quests. Also people who tank dungeons while leveling will want at least one up to date rare weapon and buying a second rare weapon to complement it for dual wield is often more economical than buying a 2h.
---
There are mages wars rogue warlocks and hunters who played sub-perfect back in 2005. There will be many in Classic as well. You are mistaken if you think your pserver is representative of all Classic population.
---
It is for Alliance. You do Hillsbrad, 10K needles, Desolace, Dustwallow, Alterac, Arathi, and Badlands. You have to travel around a lot more but you get more variety of experience in exchange and also pick up a bunch of useful flight paths.
---
OP plays on a server that rhymes with Fourth Snail.  I’ve seen over 10k regularly on here with a TON (thousands at least) of people leveling up. 
---
What a pointless thread this is. 
---
Yes. You mount up in Gadgetstan and look around as you ride out. If people start to come after you you just turn back to safety. You can see a long way in Tanaris. In STV they can be lurking behind every tree so you can only be sure no one is close enough that you can see their health bar. I've been ganked more in UnGoro than in Tanaris by people competing for mining nodes and devilsaur leather. 
---
Couldn't have said it better.
---
It was also a bit too comparable to some warriors ability I bieve, the guy designing classes said that in a recent interview. 
---
I'll give you an example. Let's consider a monster which gives 590 exp, according to you post: if both players are level 30, each gets 295 xp, if one is lv 29, and the other lb 30, each gets around 150 xp.
---
I think you should remove the extra divide by two in the computation for different levels, because I think that in the second case, one player would get 300 xp and the other 290 xp.
---
If this isn't case, I'd ask myself wtf Blizzard thinks. 
---
&gt; Streaming wasn't around back then so... 
---
Yet the first video livesteam I ever watched was just after wow beta released at a staggering 0.5 fps.
---
you can heal just about all content in the game as 30/00/21 if you aren't in a bleeding edge world first guild, and then you can swap gear out and melt people in pvp
---
Sadly, yes this is going to happen. People are severely underestimating how much worse the dps-specs of hybrid classes are are in 1.12. And 1.12 is probably their high-point across the whole expansion, before that they had worse talents and even more limiting item options.
---
The worse for me was trying to quest in the shimmering flat as an alliance (the fucking levelling guide said to do that).
---
Horde, horde everywhere.
---
STV was an easy ride compared to that.
---
could you please point me in the right direction?
---
You’re right. I can Pom/pyro all day long at 28... jesus some people are just going to try to ignore the point and bury simple rotations into the ground. 
---
You might have a point.
---
A little ankle biting gnome paparazzi stalking you with his merry band of followers, critiquing your every move and decision?
---
I can see how that would piss me off a bit.
---
However, I don't feel it's fair to force Blizzard to fix this issue if it comes up.
---
How can you say that? You need to learn your class in order to raid properly. It becomes more complex if you have more areas in which you have to partake. 
---
Mages need to keep sheeping Axe Throwers or squishy melees will die. 
---
Warriors will have to learn how to tank, because you dont need 8tanks in MC, but early on hounds do too much damage to just be tanked by one tank, so your furies will equip some tank gear and tank them.
---
Raiding and playing your class isnt mutually exclusive.
---
Most AAA releases have fallen flat in terms of my expectations since October minus RDR2, and I've just been sitting here watching youtube and thinking about Classic WoW. That's what I'm waiting for, Classic WoW.
---
Until summer, it seems like I'm just idling and talking with my friends about what we'll all roll.
---
So you think in Classic the way you should think is "minmax or die"?
---
This. Levels and gear are much harder to get in vanilla but they actually feel meaningful. There will be a good number of people that get sucked in just the way we did back in the day. 
---
Being a noob. I remember seeing the duskwood emerald dragon for the first time and i was WOW !!! 'Goosebumps '
---
Right so this is the heart of what I'm getting at. The people you described at the end your post, the ones who burn out and get stuck in the 30s and 40s, they don't seem to exist on private servers.  
---
As an experiment, I added nearly everyone who I grouped with at low levels so I could track there progress. I have about 50 characters added in this way.  
---
Of those 50 or so characters (all of whom I added pre level 20) over 30 of them are alts of players who already have a max level toon. 3 of them are new players and the rest won't respond to my whispers.  
---
It seems to me that private servers have a small (relative to original vanilla total population) but dedicated group of players who are seeking end game content. It's seems that churn (the number of old players quitting and new players coming in) is relatively low. But it also seems that the percentage of the server that is made up of max level characters is significantly higher than. It was back in the day.  
---
Again I could be wrong, but I am curious what you guys think .
---
Ya anytime I didn't like something about retail I could ways just play and level some alts till next expansion or something. But everything feels the same now. So I just don't play anymore. Really looking forward to classic
---
So when you are lvl 44, a lvl 35 mob will be grey to you. But when you ding to lvl 45, that same lvl 35 mob will suddenly be green again. That's funny.
---
Yup, you're right, it's 290/300 split, the /2 is already factored in. I'll change above.
---
Reckoning bombs are still gonna be a thing, wat D:
---
No ones asking for a bullet pointed list, just YouTube vids that arent crammed filler to get to 10 mins+.
---
Strawman arguments, why even bother
---
Well apart from that it's still a 3 sec instant range stun so enough people will run it.
---
It's not my choice. If it depended on me, Blizzard should fix class balance. But everybody will oppose that, so minmaxing is what we'll get.
---
The world needs more crabs :-D
---
I mean, is the difference between real-time berating and being featured on a YouTube video the next day to the same level of berating actually any different?
---
How much of a DPS boost do you get from weapon skills?  Would it make a huge difference for human tanks to have 305 as their skill in swords vs non human tanks that have 300?
---
They didn't exploit, they stacked warlock because it was less disadvantaged by a mechanic.
---
My point is, what can be seen as impossible "mathematically" could be wrong if you min max and use things that nobody else thought of.
---
I'm pretty sure that the hardcore min maxer we have today with every bis racial, gear, raid composition, world buffs and consumables, and with everyone having max engineering for sapper charge, they would output at least 2 times more dps than what they defined as the max dps attainable back in the day.
---
tfw you don't realize that there's an entire aspect of the game outside of raiding in vanilla and each class can play wildly differently to what they do in raids.
---
I peed my undies a bit when I heard Classic announced. Played 2005-10 straight. Quit cause the game started to change too much from what I fell in love with.
---
I catch myself preparing for Classic launch in my mind. Resurrecting my old main, and my six lvl60 alts with same class/race/gender/name/specc/profession.
---
Sounds like Netflix had already hired the guy.  Nothing burger.
---
You'd be PvP'ing a Shadow Priest and a Hunter and then suddenly pirates start popping on you and you die. The end.
---
POM/pyro is irrelevant for leveling, which is the subject of this thread.
---
Dude you are right but the guy you are talking to has been playing on pservers for years now. It wouldn't be logical for him to accept any further changes in Classic when you've been minmaxing the shit out of the game for years. He argues for his own interest, as are doing all the nochanges pservers players.
---
But 1 thing he forgets is that, that minmaxing attitude is what will destroy the game sense of community, epic feeling and chillness, if everyone listens to it.
---
Fortunately, many Classic people won't be pservers players.
---
By this logic, don't even step outside your house
---
That's a good point but there's a very easy solution: just avoid servers where streamers play.
---
I personally don't even watch any of them.
---
I don’t like pvp. What else is there ?
---
Speculation: I'd bet May as when a classic is released.  That around the time the 6-month subscriptions from BfA will be expiring and classic might result in them re-upping.
---
I would think windfury would make 2h very good on horde side
---
You’re missing the whole context. This isn’t an argument about how to make a game better. This is the wow classic forum. Which is focused on creating the game as it was. 
---
Streams sell games. Companies literally pay a SHITLOAD of money for big streamers to play their games. [Here is an excellent video explaining just how much money is in streaming, if you're interested in learning about that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m5P_n5njCQ) It would literally be one of the dumbest decisions they could make. It's the equivalent of Blizzard saying "I do not want free advertising". It will never happen, and to put it curtly, isn't even worth thinking about. 
---
Yup Rag was broken and I'm pretty sure Nef was too (I don't know if he was actually broken or it just took guilds months to craft Ony cloaks for all their raiders but I'm fairly confident he was also broken). Both MC and BWL were basically cleared in a week except for Rag and Nef who took about 2.5 months each to kill (ie for Blizzard to fix) and you never hear people asking for "pre-nerf" Rag or Nef.
---
I'm not even talking private server where people do better on the specs than they did in vanilla. Read what I'm actually writing.
---
That's like a whole easy level though. 
---
Confusing what you stand to gain by being toxic to a new player interested in the game
---
&gt;What company in its right mind would exclude 1 million people in queues if they could **spin up another instance of a starting zone** and let in more people?
---
This is the crux of the issue. Some people like you and many others are ok with sharding, instancing, LFG, flying mounts, etc.
---
Of course sharding is a possible approach to launch day. What you need to attempt to understand that there are Vanilla fans who do not want to play in a sharding experience, and would rather *other solutions be explored*.
---
And the fact is there are other solutions, one of them being **login queues.**
---
Just be sure to hang in there for about a month or so after its release. I'm sure there will be bugs to work out and some thinning out of the player base. I don't expect any current retail players that didn't experience it Vanilla to stick around very long. 
---
NO MORE SCRAP O MATIC!!!!!
---
Putting out a lot less DPS and holy spec being more useful to a raid. 
---

Yikes, you consider that overpopulation? Looks like a typical pre raid night to me.
---
Yes, High elf paladins make sense. Blood elf paladins, however, much less so. Instead of using the light the way regular paladins would, they harnessed the energies of Naaru hostage. Or at least they did so before the Sunwell was reignited. The Blood knights' egotistical approach to light usage fits their race theme better (exploiting energy sources to survive and pursue their personal goals), but it is still somewhat convoluted I think.
---
I guess the Blood knights wield the light differently not because they can't wield it normally, but rather because they don't want to, as they don't really follow the Holy Light religion. The Holy Light priests are an exception, as they were and still are outcasts to an extent in regards to greater elven society (similarly to warlocks in most other races, but not as much). They even helped Lordaeron in the third war despite the orders of Anasterian to withdraw from the Alliance. 
---
You say that, but imagine the 300 toons running around after their favourite twitch streamer "yelling" etc.... Not very classic imho and tbh not something I want to play with.
---
Surely you wouldn't have met them if they weren't in the same shard
---
I'm levelling on a successful private server atm and the place is FILLED with low level players. 
---
Westfall has its own economy ffs atm
---
Being able to only mail one thing at a time to my alts. Oh wait...
---
In all seriousness? I missed all the strange quest chains that took you to far off lands and zones you probably weren't ready for. I liked checking a random vendor and being rewarded by finding out that she sold an item or recipe that you couldn't find anywhere else. I miss being rewarded for exploration in general.
---
&gt;  but analysis of numbers like this takes away from the vanilla experience.
---
Analysis of numbers like this is WHY I like vanilla.
---
&gt;The whole point is not to treat the game like a second data analyst job lol.
---
The whole point FOR YOU. Other people like other things.
---
I imagine it being hard to figure out what hateful strikes actually did when it just seemingly oneshot random people.
---
Nefarian! How've you been, you old slack-jawed scallywag? I've missed you.
---
Yeah, well, that's just like, your opinion man.
---
Yes. Exactly my point.
---
&gt; They always say it's just nostalgia.
---
Doug, you waited five hours in line for a SNES classic.
---
Yea. Something seems out of place here. If I'm 59, a lvl 47 would still be green? I don't think so. 
---
Are you just really optimistic after all the bad news about activision blizzard?
---
Are you okay with sharding? Just seems like any sane person would at least have some worries from all the terrible PR lately from blizz, and the dumpster fire of the demo 
---
Always show the xp you get from killing mobs on the combat text. Then you can see quickly that it’s often a waste of time to kill green mobs at low levels.
---
&gt; I'd bet May as when a classic is released. That around the time the 6-month subscriptions from BfA will be expiring
---
6 months after BFA is February 14, 2019
---
I wouldn't be surprised if pve servers are getting a lot more popular than they were in Vanilla. I've talked to quite a lot of ppl, all who played PVP in Vanilla and most are saying they are going to roll on PVE if they are interested in Classic. Also some streamers have already said they prolly go PVE to avoid streamsniping and stuff, which in turn might also bring their fanboi's to PVE. 
---
That run back 🤮
---
The best geared and skilled ret with aq gear will do less damage than a rogue in pre raid blues. You will cause major drama in guild by bringing memespecs the moment you wipe a few times, and it can cause guild breakups easily.
---
Yeah, now that I think about. I have as well, let alone a while day in WC. 
---
In addition to that I'm pretty sure there's a shot of undead rangers in the BFA cinematic with visible arm bones
---
Sadly he is right though on this regard, Warmode really brought WPVP back, up to levels i haven't encountered on my realms since before BG's launched in Vanilla. 
---
All private servers have a bug/etc that causes ret paladins to be one of the best dps classes if specd right. Retail vanilla rets will not do anywhere close to private server rets.
---
This is the best thing I've ever read
---
Getting an instant cast spell every now and then isn't fun enough to be worth 3% crit, 2% hit and 40ish spell damage, but that's just my opinion.
---
I’ve always thought of it like a dessert or food in general. Ah «this» combined with «that» tastes so amazing! Ooooh ye add some of «this» too! But if you mix in too much, it all becomes a plain mash that doesnt taste anything at all.
---
&gt; The 30’s is also where your leveling pace falls off a cliff unless you know how to rotate questing between multiple zones.
---
I doubht this wil really be a issue though, during beta i reckon enough addons will be made to help with this. Even stuff like Zygor and Dugi might enter this market i guess. 
---
Im sure investors would still like to know sub numbers as a metric 
---
&gt; I think it's more of a cultural depravity than anything. You see streamers all the time berate and belittle people in real time with their viewers.
---
So?  That used to happen on Vanilla wow forums as well.
---
He was not fired, he was “fired”. Probably thought actiblizz wasn’t going places, so he took his 10mil and got headhunted by netflix. Then they “fired” him for reasons unrelated to his work. 
---
Unless you're willing to dedicate a lot of time to the game, I'd highly recommend raiding as a dps rather than a tank. Tanks have to be very consistent and farm a great deal in addition to being pretty terrible at farming themselves.
---
Playing a damage class gives you the ability to farm easier and still contribute, yet if you miss a raid because of family commitments you don't screw over your guild.
---
Thanks, that's a great contribution!
---
Female Undead actually have some cool animations. Front Flipping eviscerates are fun. 
---
Lots of great feedback here.  Thanks everyone for weighing in!
---
Yes, but those players can basically smash their faces into the keyboard as their rotation and out DPS the tank...
---
:)
---
Not bad for an Alliance.
---
See ya in STV!  :)
---
My guild didn't force loot but gimmick/alt spec items cost only 10% of a standard upgrade item.  I thought that worked pretty well.
---
Im really stuck between playing No Man's Sky and Path of Exile. What do yall think? Open world exploration or dungeon crawler?
---
I think the meant the deal for 6 months of game-time and a mount for a one-time cost, it came a while after bfa launched.
---
They’re talking specifically about pvp...
---
But they didn't offer the 6 month mount right away. I didn't do the math but may sounds right from that time. 
---
I’m going to echo other replies here, OP, and say there must be some mistake.  That or it’s the server you play on. I’m new to vanilla and the community I joined is jam-packed. The starter zones are full of people and I never expected such a large community. 
---
I'm explaining what to expect since people here are interested but clearly have no idea. How is that gatekeeping?
---
In retail? ya... In classic? not really.
---
Oh my mistake, I've been playing alliance too long and forgot. Yes 2h fury with windfury and hamstring spam is pretty good for horde. I haven't run the math myself but the general idea is that by the time the player is pre-raid BiS or better geared fury is still better unless the warrior gets lucky and gets [Bonereaver's Edge](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=17076) off Ragnaros
---
Maybe, but lvling isnt my favorite part of the game.  I just want to get through it as fast as possible while learning my class as much as I can on the way.
---
In 5 mans at 60 my pet is usually between 10-15% of my damage on pserver. 
---
While leveling/grinding its closer to 40%
---
I know you didn't mean it, but I'm imagining 7 level 60 dwarf paladins named Monkey a-g
---
ah! That makes sense.
---
No it’s how
---
Long will they play before they get bored. Someone’s argument is that mages are a one button class. And have no other options. I’m providing that counter argument. Just stop. 
---
Don't underestimate a ret paladin. They can hit like a truck and use blessings. A ret in T2 or better is a scary thing. 
---
Quality content as always Raserisk. Was afraid you wouldn't make any more boss guides since it had been five months since your last video, glad to see you're back at it so I have another useful resource to show guildies.
---
Doubt that you would see a lot of DW fury tanks outside of somewhat hardcore guild environment.
---
Protection is a much safer bet for PUGs. Or bring your overgeared healer friends with you.
---
I've kind of lost hope in classic with the way Blizz has been as of late. I hope I'm wrong but they are most likely going to screw up in some fashion.
---
I think he was referring to this: [https://www.wowhead.com/news=287276/blizzard-shop-180-days-of-game-time-dreadwake-mount-capn-crackers-battle-pet](https://www.wowhead.com/news=287276/blizzard-shop-180-days-of-game-time-dreadwake-mount-capn-crackers-battle-pet)
---
  But I mean that came out in September, so March?
---
Vanilla isn't all about the end game raid mechanics like modern wow is. It's about the slow rpg, social, progression of your character in the world.
---
Reckbomb will be there. 
---
It's my opinion of course...but I feel like the negatives of addons over the years outweigh the positives. Many other MMOs do just fine without the support of addons. 
---
THIS!
---
I remember using different wands (shadow, arcane, fire) on some mobs to test if they had any magical resists.  
---
But yes, to be one of the firsts inside AQ40, those damn trash mobs being harder than some of the bosses.
---
"Don't heal range DPS!"
---
"Don't AOE the elites" in dungeons.
---
Taking off all your armor to die in MC to the imps to make it easier to get back to the other side of the raid encounter.  Seeing naked Taurens, Undead, Troll, and Orc toons running across the landscape was just hysterical.  Everyone had on a speedo!
---
Running Scholo for the epic robes and staff and killing those bosses while really going to make flasks.  
---
Guilds sharing 'cleared Scholo's' for each other to make flasks.
---
Pretending to be asleep and afk at the entrance of Scholo and dying to PVP so you can resurrect inside the foyer when no one in your party has the key!  :)
---
Unnerfed instances, the "hard" Jandice; the 'hard' Strath; and the hard, unnerfed spiders in LBRS, the fire orcs, the trolls...  The bosses who could one-shot your warrior if he/she were in the wrong stance or didn't have the proper protection talent points.
---
Boss fights that were SO hard, it was epic and sometimes better than raid bosses, as you had to rely on the quick thinking of your 5-man squad / team / group.
---
Locks needing to go into LBRS for their class quest item; and leaving after the first boss.
---
Ditto hunters going into LBRS with NO pet because they needed to train the higher bite rank of the worgs.  (FFS, bring a throw-away pet!)
---
The FIRST time entering all of the instances, not knowing what to expect, who to kill, what the mobs did, which way to go, and the absolute fun of figuring it out.
---
I heard they offered a 6month package that came with a mount too.
---
OH, the ORIGINAL CLASS quests -- shammy's for totems taking them across the world; druid swimming quest...
---
The original hard / tough / you learn and earn your class and right to play it concepts.
---
As long as they don't force other people to do so that's fine.
---
The problem is that minmaxing mindset has also convinced many of them that playing anything else than a top dps or tank class in a group (yes sometimes even 5 mans!) should be forbidden, while it was common stuff in Vanilla. This is dangerous and against the mindset you are talking about.
---
When things go wrong, what can you do about it? You look for someone else, it can easily take 3-4 hours. Nostalgia man !
---
This is what I am looking forward to with Classic, actual tech support... 
---
Of course there will be bugs, but it won't take long for them to smooth them out unlike pservers that are running their second server cycle (third if you count other servers with the same build) with the same year+ old bugs.
---
How am I gatekeeping? I'm literally doing the opposite. People are interested in RP but clearly have no idea where to start or what to expect. It's cool that they're interested in my hobby. I'm trying to help them out by sharing what I know.  
---
\&gt;ask someone how to play a game  
---
\&gt;"it's cool that you're interested in my hobby here let me explain the rules"  
---
\&gt;dont gatekeep bro let me play how i want  
---
\&gt;?????  
---
You shouldn't have issues with debuff slots. However, any raiding guild that does raid with SP will only want 1/raid making it very difficult to ultimately be that person unless you're pretty hard core or just want to be there for MC and maybe BWL. AQ40 and Naxx I would imagine they want optimized/max healing not decent dps for that slot.
---
Sorry to break it to you, but Blizzard selling gold did not fix the problem of gold sellers people still buy gold today the only difference is the market is now hyper inflated and less people are banned for it.
---
Unfortunately, you don't live in the real world, otherwise you would know just how damaging selling gold so casually is. Now you can repeatedly shill for activsion 1000 different ways but it won't change the fact that selling gold doesn't fix the problem and it shouldn't be done in the first place.
---
Ty that helps a lot I am def leaning towards warlock now thanks
---
Next Challenge, Akiris by the bundle quest.
---
Maaaaaammmm, more hot pockets!
---
yeah, i doubt you've raided as ret in vanilla.
---
the biggest problem was running out of mana. even with downgrading seals you still cant outdps most of the classes. most dps mana users have consistent class ways to replenish on top of BoW, leaving rets with dick.
---
Nope. Back then it was fine without minmaxing, even if somehow it is hard to believe for some. Now it will also be fine. You have the choice.
---
Also the real decision you'll have to take, is being an asshole or not when an offspec/not hardcore player offers you to do a dungeon with you or to enter your guild. Don't forget that.
---
You realize that shard are dynamically assigned right ? There is no one-time shard ID or anything.
---
You can meet someone in Northshire because he's in the same shard, then not see him for a long time because, bad luck, you end up in different shards later on.
---
The chances of that happening increase with the number of shards.
---
This is the best explanation I've read on this. 
---
I also have to point out that Im playing casually on a server right now and the lower level zones are incredibly active.
---
Low - mid level auctions are also active. Perhaps the items you were looking up were being bought out because everything I list sells..
---
So much this. Raids NEED to be retuned for 1.12 class mechanics and itemization or the first two tiers are going to be the same pathetic sad excuse of content as they are on private servers.
---
Before my recent experiences on a pserver, I was all for people playing any spec they choose.. ret, enhance, boomkin etc etc.  Now that I have some recent experience in end game 5-mans and raids, my opinion has drastically shifted to the other side.
---
For example, in a recent 5-man I invited a boomkin into the group.  He was pulling less than 10% of group's total dps and I literally couldn't stop looking at it on the meters.  I play a rogue, and usually pull anywhere from 30-50% of group's dps depending on group composition.  I probably won't invite a boomkin to another 5 man that I am leading, because its just not worth it.  I could take a mage or a warrior and get someone that can actually match my dps and *contribute equally.*  Or I can grab a hunter/warlock that can almost match rogue/mage dps and will contribute some additional utility.  
---
It's a hard pill to swallow, but its just the honest truth.  I wish that boomkins and elemental/enh shamans and retadins were more viable, I really do, because I want to play these specs.  I am not saying that all dps classes should be within 5% of each other, but its not fun when your doing half of the group's dps and there is a guy doing a third of your damage.  All you can do is sit and think, wow I should have waited another minute to get another group member.
---
We're arguing a bit of semantics here.
---
I don't consider CC'ing mobs, and outputting AoE to be "learning your class." That's something everyone needs to do.
---
You wouldn't consider avoiding the fire, or moving into the correct position to be attributed to "the complexity of the class", because it's not a class specific role. Everyone has to do it, so everyone has to learn it (And by everyone, I mean "most").
---
Which leads to lower DPS, and when your raid decide they could use another healer then you're the one they look at. 
---
Raided MC/ZG in vanilla and then everything up until MoP as ret.
---
&gt;There's nothing to be lost
---
There is everything to be lost, #nochanges
---
It’s fun at lvl 60 as a rogue to gank lowbie noobs there all day;)
---
Moonkin Form was added in 1.08. I had a few guildies that enjoyed it as well. They healed as balance on fights where we needed it.
---
Yeah but even some of the best meme spec players are being out damaged by below-average DPS classes.
---
September 23rd is right around the corner!
---
Fuckin' this.
---
18.5k in Vanilla? That's not possible. 
---
I tend to dual wield once I get the swords from RFD/SM Cath quests. Once you get Thrash Blade it's a wrap.
---
I also play Human.
---
Subreddit =/= playerbase. Never forget that.
---
No one who is over the age of 12 really cares about streamers, the player base is too old this is a non issue
---
The pre-DHK days.
---
That monitor is my current 2nd monitor. 
---
Hmm man there are so many rough world pvp zones in vanilla. I wonder what's honestly worse? STV? Hillsbrad or Tanaris? It's an absolute warzone in every single one of these zones and I'm thinking about rolling a priest /crying emoji
---
In a way, the rotation complexity reverses after a while. For a while, you get more buttons to press, but then more and more buttons become irrelevant. For example, at the very earliest levels, it may be more efficient to switch between Fireball and Frostbolt, but you'll soon only be using one of them.
---
For a while, Frostbolt may be your main source of damage, but Fireblast and Arcane Missiles may also be better in some circumstances. And a rotation of Wand - Wand - Autoattack may be better than just Wand - Wand - Wand.
---
What ruins it is that talents and stats and spell power only targets one spell, that you'll specialize on, which makes one spell much stronger than the other spells when you get stronger, making everything else irrelevant. But for a while, when you are leveling and not too strong, you'll have a number of spells to use. At earlier levels, each spell has its use, but later, one spell gets strong enough to cover every use.
---
On a brighter note, mana management gets more engaging. You get plenty of mana cooldowns, and trying to juggle the different mana sources is pretty engaging.
---
All this is only for leveling though, I have no experience at the highest levels.
---
I leveled a human warrior while dual wielding from 20+ on a pserver recently.
---
I found it to be a lot more enjoyable than using a 2her. I love being able to finish mobs quickly while fleeing with a shorter swing timer.
---
It was pretty rough for the first 10-15 levels but once you get the swords from RFD and SM Cath quests it gets a lot better. 
---
I also aimed to do as many green leveled quests as possible and that helped a lot since I would just chew through mobs about 5-6x faster than mobs my level and above.
---
Ha, I remember getting pulled into MC at lvl 59 for the first time I believe or immediately after dinging 60 cause my guild wanted to start gearing me up. I hadn't researched a damn thing and never saw any MC content or even a 40 man raid. I was just placed in an off tank group and did my best not to die or let the team down. Great memories since we did a full clear that night including Rag, I ended up getting my Eye of Divinity that night as well for Bene I believe.
---
That’s kinda vague and not really any example
---
&gt;See a youtuber react to announcement. 
---
Sums up your entire low quality post, 1/10 bad effort
---
wut.e
---
Hehehe. Not quite. Never did make it past starting zones as Alliance, since I only played Alliance on US realms when EU realms where down.
---
Only char I didn't reach 60 with before TBC was a shaman.
---
&gt; that is rather on the players than the class.
---
Yes. It's a Catch-22. Any players inexperienced enough to be totally fine with a Paladin tank most likely aren't experienced enough to understand how to gimp their DPS, only target the marked mobs, not use CC (because Tankadins hold aggro by getting hit), etc, etc.
---
Every single awesome player I ran with was very upfront: Paladins heal or DPS. Period.
---
It's one of the contradictions of Vanilla that I think retail players haven't come to terms with. Good players understand the value of avoiding memespecs, even though they're actually best positioned to deal with them.
---
Yes, it's a contradiction. Vanilla was full of contradictions.
---
i hope so, but a part of me feels like that's too early considering we haven't head much from Blizzard yet.  You'd think if they were 5 months away from shipping they'd give us some more info and at least a beta announcement.
---
It went something like this:
---
Wipe 1 - 5 Healers for fuck sake get your shit together and heal the tank.
---
6-10 oh good now the tank actually lived for 20 seconds but you're all at half mana and the OT strangely died, did you fuck up your threat MT?
---
11 - 20 Ok this isn't working, he's obviously not meant to be tanked, it's impossible. There's gotta be a gimmick.
---
21 - 40 lets try hunter kiting over frost traps, or run him into the slimes, or try and put him in the slime maybe that weakens him, maybe there's a spell that un-enrages him? Hunters did you try tranq shot?
---
41 - 50 Ok let's just try again, pull with shieldwall or some shit... WHY ARE THE FUCKING ROGUES DYING?! DID YOU ALL PULL AGGRO YOU RETARDS?!
---
50+ Huh look at that, our feral OT is eating every single hateful strike.. wonder why that is?... hey guys did u notice the slime halves your HP? oooooohhh.
---
I really wish they would do this. I love healing on my Druid, not fond of taking 30 seconds to kill a level 50 satyr or whatever I’m farming at the time. 
---
Last time I played retail I could just press a button anywhere OoC and that seemed like too much. 
---
A NPC in a major city that you have to go talk to, maybe a small gold fee, would be ideal. 
---
I do a mixture for my alts. Some are male, some female.
---
It's all about casting/swing animations. For example, human female priest has such a nice heal animation to me.
---
Dwarf Male also has a nice heal animation, nice 2h swing animations but i dont like the damaging cast animation so I choose Paladin there.
---
Night Elf females have really cool 1h swing animations when playing rogue.
---
The model can be a factor too, proportions, shoulder size all affect how armor looks.
---
I hate troll male because they're always bare foot...
---
Amazing. 
---
Compared to any other class with a similar gear setup, they are the least threatening.
---
lol. So wrong xD
---
2019 is time for me to build a new pc too. Its so odd, Im going to drop 4k on a rig and spend most of my time playing Classic fucking WoW that cant/wont utilize even a quarter of the hardware Ill be paying for.
---
Maybe Diablo 4 will launch in the next year or two and be a decent game.. /shrug
---
Thank you!
---
Actually they're spending money to un-introduce them.  It's technology they've already developed, and we're using the 7.x or 8.x client for Classic.
---
I built my dream computer last month that could run any game on Ultra and I will be using it to play a 12 year old game. Can’t wait!
---
They published them until the numbers kept dipping.  The reason they don't publish them anymore is because they're not anywhere near what they used to be.
---
Breaking point  - Pulling too many mobs trying to harvest the 8 buckets of grapes for Milly Osworth
---
Its a metaphor for the collapse of democracy in brazil
---
I think the best implementation of this is to not have set terms of victory and defeat, but rather to just have the organizers declare a zone or sub-zone as the designated "battleground".  Let the victories and defeats be debatable so as to encourage factions and players to develop their own narratives of how the "war" is going.
---
Use in game channels as well as a discord channel to make sure everyone knows when and where the battle is.
---
The best WPvP is emergent, and it's almost impossible to get large groups to abide by strict rules with no official enforcement.  The more broad the rules of engagement, the easier it is to keep people satisfied and returning.  People will naturally try to hold choke points and assassinate infamous players of the opposing faction.  Let the players dictate their own goals.
---
Came to this comment section literally just to make this joke. Well said and thank you for your hard work Tarlinator.
---
What is the launch date? Or Open Beta?
---
I'm doing my best ;D
---
He went into full detail on how some people like to rp in simple environments and you said “see this is what I mean I feel like people who say this don’t rp” and then went on and asked him if he is even an rper.  So you are gatekeeping people from being rpers if they like to rp differently than you?  That’s what I’m gathering. 
---
I want the 4 hour ques back! Your fault if you dcd during dungeon run, will not party with your unreliable connection again.
---
THIS.  It adds so much to the class fantasy and gives you a deeper connection to the class you play.  Being an old-school rogue and doing the whole poison quest chain was so fun.  Same with locks and earning each of your demons, etc.  
---
post naxx is nothing. there is nothing after naxx. if you have t3 you have nothing to worry about ever
---
I've been thinking leveling strats for the past two months. Don't want to ruin the experience of Classic launch by doing test runs on pservers.
---
So, you're not alone in being excited for Classic.
---
Corpse runs in Felwood can also be bad... very bad.  The zone's pathing/elevation is frustrating and the zone is actually quite large... I speak from recently experience.
---
This is a statement you have absolutely no way to prove. Simply because you can't know who is playing good and who is playing bad. And your experience in your 1 or 2 guilds is not statistically more relevant than someone like me who has seen good things regarding hybrid specs. And everyone has seen pure dps behind the tank, and hybrids dps ahead of some pure dps.
---
Of course pure dps on equal skill and equal gear are better than offspec, no one wants to say that hybrids are better, but not to the point a guild should forbid 1-4 slots for offspecs in raids. And I bet they are not doing like &lt; 50% dps of a pure dps. At equal skill and gear you probably rather do like 75-90% of the dps, plus add some utility.
---
The problem is that people like to exagerate up to the point a dps offspec is literally like bringing the raid down and doing &lt; 50% dps of a pure dps spec. Sometimes they are even comparing it to someone /dancing. Like really?
---
You're free to enjoy whatever you want for sure. I definitely agree that vanilla had so many things that were made better over the years in future expansions. But wotlk was exactly when I started not approving of the direction wow was taking. 
---
To me vanilla and TBC were my absolute favorite eras. There were so many things from each I miss dearly.
---
No, I don't think anyone has said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
---
Alright buddy don’t forget to clock in. 
---
No one knows what will be the final desicion, so everyone guesses.
---
If you want to press 1 button play mage and spam frostbolt to endgame. 
---
Hunters with or without pets is the difference between fastest leveler and being slower than a warrior. 
---
Thanks for probably the only answer that doesn't flame me. 
---
I am NOT defending the whispers, but your "This is showing how toxic other players can be" could be applied to literally any online game, forum, website, comment section, etc.  People shit talk in every single game.  Its just what people do online.  Shouldn't surprise anyone.  Letting it affect you in anyway is pointless.
---
Yes that’s what I’m trying to get at. That’s the mindset that made the game worse in the first place. 
---
Hahaha yeah some items in Vanilla really made no sense. There was also some cloth boots, moccasins of the white hare? Gave agility and spirit lol
---
They invited him. Did they not think to ask what spec/role he would be playing?
---
What strategies were used on Anub'Rekhan that weren't intended? I know the basic strategy of kiting during locust and keeping max distance
---
Hot damn, you’re right! Can’t wait!
---
Classic WoW! the real WoW killer 😁👍
---
305 weapon skill puts you one full level closer to the boss's level, effectively making you a level 61 vs a 63 for combat purposes. I think this allowed you to need 2% less hit which was pretty big on gear. Your glancing blows also had less of a penalty, I think it was 85% of normal damage instead of 70%
---
It's not really a woman's ass though, you're fantasising over what is essentially a cartoon. You're the weird one.
---
I want to be an orc, but I like the female orc models and animations better. So I'm going to be a female orc
---
Fair— but consider this; there’s 15 raptors that spawn and you need 10 scales. There’s also 5 other players trying to do the same quest in the area. Will you discriminate based on level for these kills? The answer is no it’s more efficient to kill any raptor that spawns to get the quest done regardless what level it is. 
---
Then the opposing faction will stream snipe them and kill/corpse camp all of them. Mark my words, streamers will unintentionally create some of the greatest world PvP. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/D78VYQH I may be an altaholic.
---
Really high quality, thanks for putting this together. Subscribed so I hope you keep it up!
---
I played since Vanilla and led semi-hardcore guilds since WotLK (though I haven't and won't be touching BFA). My wife and I will likely have our first child by the time Naxx comes out, at which point I will have to be done with raiding for good. Nonetheless, my hope for Classic is to start a flexible guild where efficient but non-elitist raiding can still happen at least one night per week.
---
A side thought I've had is to do a 4 hour raid on Tuesdays, with a 15 minute break in between 2 hour segments. This would allow more time-limited players to swap out while also catering to more time zones. If we're going to go more casually anyway, then we don't need a dedicated team getting all of the purples. It's probably a bad idea, but I'm mulling it over.
---
Like you, I've traditionally main tanked in the past, but know that will not be an option for me this time around. I can't be the heavy-lifting, do-it-all kind of GM-MT anymore, but I still want to find or start a guild that raids efficiently without being overbearing. In Legion, I had time to raid Mythics once a week with my guild as DPS, delegating a lot of responsibilities to my longtime guildies. I kind of want to do it again. Part of me relishes the thought of not having to deal with the responsibility of leading a guild, but I also really like creating spaces for people to enjoy the game and achieve goals together, and there are so many bad GMs out there.
---
Ah... decisions, decisions.
---
🙄 not even gona bother reading this... take your math and calculations crap elsewhere 
---
What the hell are you talking about?  That has nothing to do with the point of this analysis
---
I am strongly opposed to sharding even if it was only used for launch.
---
No one is entitled to do anything in the world of vanilla. Can't find any mobs to kill? Group up with some people or go somewhere else or get gud and out tag the rest of the competition. If it's really too terrible of an experience for you to handle then roll a less populated race or on a less population server or just go outside and wait for the initial surge to die down. 
---
I will literally run around the world to unlock every flight path in the game and explore my way to lvl 10 before I endorse sharding. 
---
To this date, I still twitch a bit when I hit SHIFT multiple times in a row.
---
You'll have no probkem getting into instance groyps quickly as a tank, so pre-BIS farkimg should be fairly quick. MC, BWL and ZG will be puggable. You should be able to get in raids regularly enough to get geared. A smart guild should want skilled and geared guys who are happy to sit on the bench and come in if available and needed.
---
And then the server crashes because they can't handle all the players or they can't snipe because of sharding.
---
I don't think most tourists will even get to STV.  I'm thinking the overwhelming majority of tourists will be gone by the early 20s.
---
same here. i just dont know how to survive the next haöf year till it comes out. already played a bit on a private server, but it just makes it worse. cabt remember the last time i wanted to play a game that much.
---
Nah, it runs on the retail client so it’s not a 12 year old game it’s a modern client. So mega expensive PC purchase not wasted :)
---
Warmode isn't really a sharding based feature that necessitates sharding into many smaller shards though. The only reason they're sharding the current content in such a manner is either they need to because the population would be breaking their current server infrastructure or it's more cost-effective to allocate the serverspace in the most crowded parts of the world dynamically.
---
Sharding is NOT out of RP Realms, stop spreading this misinformation. 
---
Give ne a date! Need to book the week off before someone else does!
---
Currently all we know is 'Summer 2019'
---
You can't pull "a lot more mobs". Even pulling 1 more mob is double the damage you're taking in, and you're not mitigating double the damage that arms or fury is. You're also dealing a lot less damage so you're going to get hit for longer by 2 mobs rather than 1, on the way to killing just 1 then you have the other to deal with. More importantly, your rage generation is going to be terrible, making it a much more boring situation, and less rage for stuff like Hamstring, Shield Block for your actual mitigation, and your tools to deal with multiple mobs aren't there like Cleave (rage starved), Whirlwind, Sweeping Strikes.
---
It'll make sense to go prot and deal with multiple mobs when you have a group, namely a healer. But even with just one healer, non-elite mobs are going to be a breeze to heal through with a dedicated healer, unless they're doing a lot of the dps as well (risky because of mana). Best thing to do if you want to take on multiple mobs is find a healer buddy and go fury or arms, healer focuses on healing+autoattack/wand only, and you mow down mobs with a ton of rage for Cleave and Whirlwind. You'll be healed up just fine as arms or fury. As a healer in shadow spec, it was a piece of cake healing arms or fury warriors either as 2-man non-elite grinding or in 5-man dungeons
---
I’m interested in leveling DW as well. Did you use any particular spec?
---
Well at least your gonna play it ha. I’m gonna have to live vicariously through you guys and dream about it. 
---
I’m pretty sure I’m addicted to the damn game. So whenever I picked it back up i usually ended up losing whatever relationship I was in as well as any social life. It’s a hella of a drug. 
---
Isn't that *NOW*?!
---
Didn't think I needed /s :) Was a stab at the fury meta.
---
It happend for a while and then they fixed it and then it happened again when that pre patch hit. 
---
I agree, WOTLK was where it truly tanked.  TBC was where the decline started due to flying, but we weren't smart enough to put two and two together at the time. 
---
Haha true but if I have the option for Vanilla low polygon models I’m taking it! I think vanilla wow is a work of art. 
---
You should have zero expectations from Activision Blizzard that way you're either not disappointed or pleasantly surprised.
---
Raserisk!!
---
But what if I want to do my starting zone quest *now!* I want those grey Flax Gloves! If I can't do this quest now I'm going to quit the game, Vanilla WoW sucks.
---
Alliance Vs Horde dilemma first, then class. Sorry if there are a lot of these.
---
Basically, I *always* played horde. The bond runs deep, and it's where all of my nostalgia lies. I really want to re-experience my home, but at the same time -
---
I'm extremely intrigued by the alliance zones and lore. Especially the snow zones. If I role ally I will definitely be dwarf. 
---
I will probably only be leveling 1 character as I havent played in years and dont know the game like you pserver friends, so rolling both factions isnt really an option.
---
I suppose its worth noting that I'll be roling on an RP server and am looking at either heals or lock.
---
I just really hate gnomes and dont want to share the battlefield with them. Is it acceptable to RP an orc that was magically turned to a dwarf and is racist againt gnomes?
---
Because waiting 2 hours for your group to tag Sarkoth or skipping starting content is surely how the game was always intended to be played... not. 
---
&gt; Sharding is NOT out of RP Realms
---
OP acknowledged that in his post. 
---
&gt;My point was, it doesn't apply to "memespecs". It applies to bad players.
---
That's literally what he says in the post you replied to, that if anyone doesn't contribute or is playing poorly they shouldn't be invited.
---
The way he said "This Ret", just meant "This player" (look at the start of his sentence where he says "players like this"). He didn't say "all rets" at any point, that's just what you are reading.
---
I made the "mistake" of running a guild with the "casual players" label. Trust me, never again. This brought in players who had no idea what they were doing, and would not take advice from class leaders. But you are right, the fury warriors were still at the top, but these meme specs were above numerous mages, warlocks and rogues for example.
---
I will definitely be using the old graphics / models as well if they are an option! It really is a work of art. 
---
Charge/blink/vanish all failed pretty regularly for all sorts of reasons. Fear and poly also would often get players/mobs stuck in terrain or objects or just fall through the world floor. Getting stuck in combat was another fairly normal one back then.
---
TBC was so perfect too except for the flying. It was so very cool at the same time though. I'm really torn because it was such an experience to finally fly where you pleased, but yeah it takes away from certain things like pvp and player interaction in general. At least it was only In outlands 
---
Wotlk added yet another huge continent and the world started feeling majorly empty. And players more than ever were starting to be more independent because classes were stronger, group finder took care of player interaction to actually construct a party for dungeons. More flying. It was just all things that were tempting at the time but it took away so much more than it gave 
---
In a weird way, picking a class kinda became a bit easier when I realized that my then-primary goal in Classic (to get a Black Scarab) should be secondary to trying to help organize a mass RP campaign if RP servers become a thing. I say kinda because I still would have to actually pick a class, but it would be more to suit a character rather than “okay, which one does the best at X”  
---
For just raiding to try to get into the running for a Scarab, Mage or Fury Warrior would be my choices though.
---
&gt;That 5sec stun trinket from that sea giant in Arathi before they nerfed it.
---
they nerfed it? :(
---
"Pandaren"
---
There's your reason.
---
Happened in BC and Wrath too. 
---
PoE
---
I always liked Bloodlord's Defender over QS. QS was felt soooo slow
---
Welcome to the internet
---
TBC is the best version of Vanilla.
---
Is it less the new terrain and more the new client that "fixed" blink/charge pathing issues? 
---
Yeah for sure.  I find it to be a think to separate the hunters from the huntards. 
---
I would prefer queues to sharding very much.
---
That doesn’t change my experience. 
---
I never said it did!
---
I don't know about "someone's argument," but *my* argument is that once mages hit level 28 they aren't getting any continuous trickle of cool new abilities, assuming they're leveling as frost like most everyone does. When you write "exponentially more versatile and interesting as they level 1-60" you're bullshitting yourself. For the purpose of leveling the mage bag of tricks fills up long before 60.
---
Now that I think about it, if you called your pet back to you after laying a Freezing Trap, Growl could even be used for CC.  Huh, maybe I should try a Hunter for fun, lol.
---
Sure it does. GP is pointing out that while questing, if some of the quest mobs are green to you, you should still kill them if there is competition for mobs. 
---
If there is no competition, you should stick with yellow quest mobs if possible for the better "grinding" XP while doing the quest.
---
Lol someone seems to think my experience is wrong. 
---
So... That means that there are a few healing classes, a few damage classes, and... Warrior tank.
---
Not me!
---
There is a group of us working folk starting a guild together. Take a look at the following thread and post if you are interested =)
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9wgnxp/classic\_guild\_for\_the\_95ers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9wgnxp/classic_guild_for_the_95ers/)
---
That isn't a point that is relevant. Here's what you said that I replied to:
---
&gt; &gt; Any of these might be "something to live with" and seem like the right move at the time. That's how most of the changes happened. It was small changes over the course of several expansions, done with good intentions and that players (myself included) went along with because it seemed like a good idea at the time.
---
And here is my reply:
---
&gt; I'm not sure you're seeing my premise that you assert you're disagreeing with. WoW changed over the years because it had an active development team tasked with producing expansions that routinely shook up the game balance, added new mechanics, expanded the content, etc. The measures that Blizzard takes in order to make Classic viable are of a wholly different nature. The kinds of changes you're alluding to are the kind that cost additional money to introduce. I don't see the slippery slope here.
---
See the point? The nature of the mechanisms Blizzard is introducing to keep the project sustainable is _entirely_ different from the changes deliberately introduced by expansions. To argue they are similar is to argue in bad faith.
---
If it's a client issue (and I don't know) it should happen regularly on pservers. But AFAIK it doesn't? At least I've never experienced it personally.
---
The same thing happened in live, mostly on low and medium population servers. Everyone was 60, very few people rolled new characters on these servers, and mid level items were way inflated in price as there weren't levelers naturally farming them up. This was not an issue at all on high population servers.
---
I hope Blizzard takes a greater roll in managing their servers this time by merging dead and stagnating servers 
---
But that's not what it would be without sharding.  It would just be huge queue times and poor performance. 
---
I think a lot of people don't distinguish properly between, sharding, phasing, multi tap nodes, cross realm content etc... And attribute anything bad that happens because of those to the generic sharding monster.
---
Wrong again. I mean hell the 31 point Ice talent is tremendous for soloing and largely beneficial for staying alive in group/raid content. You become more efficient as well. Evoc is wonderful. Etc etc. to each their own. Sure in JUST a raid setting they’re kind of a one trick pony. They’re pretty versatile and have other cool utilities (like ports) that are fun in classic wow. 
---
People like yourself often overlook those things because of modern gaming, and that’s a shame. 
---
Also I used level 27/28 just to tell my story, you’re claiming their kit is complete? Why 28? Do you mean 26 because that’s when they get cone of cold? 
---
What about in the 30’s when they get 45% increased damage to CoC thru talents or 10% extra crit. At 28 you wouldn’t even have the shatter talent maxed which is arguably the most important talent for leveling Frost mages. 
---
Trolls gonna troll. 
---
&gt; but at the least it shows they were willing and capable of keeping sharding out of RP realms when they decided it made sense
---
They weren't. They kept it out of the RP zones where there's much less population than in current content. If you're in EU feel free to log in to Argent Dawn on peak times and experience the serverlag in Stormwind with multiple seconds delay because they're not sharding it.
---
Yeah just hit 57 last night lol can’t wait for 60 and the second I hit it I’ll probably just roll an alt
---
I leveled a mage to around 40 on a private server a few years ago and I dont really remember it happening any more or less on average than it did on live.
---
Yes
---
To clarify the RP realm Sharding rules:
---
1) Sharding was applied to all servers with the same behavior.
---
2) A *massive* annual RP event was attempting to organize in Northrend, but couldn't keep players on the same shard without a lot of raid party coordination and frustrations.
---
3) Blizzard removed sharding on RP realms *in old world zones*. So at that time, all zones outside of the Broken Isles would *not* have sharding. (This does not affect the ability for someone to show up on the server by joining someone's cross-realm party). 
---
4) This above rule has not changed. I play on an RP server and I don't see people in our non-BFA zones from other servers, unless I can see them running around with people from my server.

Back in my vanilla days, my roommate (who introduced me) would let his younger brother who was like 6 login when he wasn't playing and grind stuff for him. The kid was just so excited to be a part of it, it never dawned on him to be bored with killing, looting, and skinning gorillas for hours. Apparently he showed him how the game worked and everything, taught him the basics, told him not to respond to people chatting, and set him loose. I'm still not sure if he was being a good or bad older brother.
---
\&gt; People should see the weird shit guilds tried on patchwerk before hateful strike was figured out. 
---
You mean the kiting strategy my guild did like this that worked perfectly? :)
---
All aboard
---
Hit the road
---
All the bullshit
---
Can't be ignored
---
unless your a dps warrior, then you never get to look that cool
---
How does the Spire of the Stoneshaper hold up if you just ignore the On Use effect?
---
You want the pet..even just as a meat shield for leveling and pvp. It's about you staying at range so you can dps the mob or person down.
---
Assuming a level 58 player got his hands on Shadowstrike how would it compare to other items usable at that level?
---
Elitist jerks is from 2006. So is shadowpanther
---
In Elwynn etc....meh. If the Barrens is sharded though, Classic has failed.
---
My new years resolution is to party less, spend less, and be at home more.
---
My girlfriend thinks it's about her. 
---
It's not about her.
---
&gt;Where do you people get the idea that every. single. class. should be able to fill a competitive dps role in raids?
---
Because every single class has a DPS spec. Somebody had to design the ret tree - you really think they invested all that time to intentionally create a useless spec?
---
It's like Moonkin. Wrath is your very first spell, you are basically playing the Balance gameplay loop for the first 10 levels no matter what. You think they meant for Wrath to end up actually useless? 
---
Fake news. The dw hit penalty never applied to two-handed weapons.
---
I think it will be more common than on pservers, but not to the extent as back in the day.
---
You tried to make her your healer, didn't you? Everyone tries to make their girlfriend/wife their healer. That's just asking for relationship strain, my dude. Have her roll a hunter or something.
---
Can’t decide between hunter, Druid, priest, lock. I want to know how farming gold is for priests and druids so that if I heal i can still afford respects for PvP. Also, may want to try feral and shadow dps. I’m not entirely sold that Druids need to farm gnomer for bis consumables as I have seen people not doing it and pulling similar dps numbers. Rogue and warr are not entirely off the table mainly because I love melee weapons. Overall, I like the ability to do whatever that comes with a Druid, the hunters shift skill ceiling and relative ease as a solo (although I don’t intend to play that way), priests are just cool to me, and locks seem interesting but I need to do a little more research on them.
---
If your spamming shadow bolt your doing it wrong
---
There wasn't much streaming, but people made fraps videos all the time and posted them to YouTube or Google video.  I don't see it being much different.
---
&gt;It was fundamentally broken with the vanilla terrain
---
Pretty sure it wasn't the terrain.  For instance, you would blink backward on bridges in AB.  There was something fundamentally buggy in their server code that caused it.
---
I’m confused. Why would we not be able to experience stuff like Reck Bombs and Tidal Charm in Classic?
---
The problem is you typically have no way of knowing if a player is going to be useless or not until it's too late.
---
I ungoro is small try wiping in brd and having a graveyard in a different zone, kind of lol. All to get back and wipe again lol.
---
No...just no.  If you are questing in am area and the quest gives you do so will the mobs.  This is to pick an area for grinding when youre at a point with the only quests available are orange and red.
---
This is what happens when you presnt a data set without context.  People get confused and start just guessing blindly.
---
Once you get the mount leveling feels faster because you spend less time traveling, maybe or so it feels.
---
Reckoning stacks were hard-capped halfway through Vanilla, so the name stayed the same but being able to one-shot Kazzak did not stay the same.
---
Indeed, Tanaris PvP was typically centered on the town. On my server it was typically more focused on the roof of the inn that some ranged classes had taken over. STV PvP was *everywhere.*
---
Lol I’m ally so that must be a horde thing. 
---
Quest mob surrounded? Pull it and run a ways away set your pet to stay with the mob and run until all the other mobs have gone outside they’re range and run back. Ez pz 
---
&gt; I don't see people in our non-BFA zones from other servers
---
That's not sharding, it's cross realm zones, sharding is contained within the same server.
---
I think I have a downvote stalker.
---
I'm delaying building a new system just for Classic. It'll be massively overkill for 99.99% of Classic, but I want The Opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj be rendered as smooth as possible on my future HFR display (assuming they don't use sharding for the event).
---
Rogues received their big update patch in 1.12. Exactly three months before TBC pre-patch.
---
This means that all Rogues in Classic will be playing a version of the class that nobody played throughout Vanilla and only existed for three months.
---
It did fix a lot of problems with Rogues (and made them OP) so I guess this is why you don't hear any complaining, but still...
---
I stopped playing BFA a bit ago and am struggling to find something to kill time.
---
I just end up watching YouTube videos about preparing for classic while swapping between a handful of games
---
I'd be so pissed if this guy won any gear over me. I had a ret pally win zinrok over me, but he was a guy I would pvp with who had wanted it for a long as time, so I was cool with him rolling. He also didn't get out dpsed by the fucking tank.
---
Technically true yes, but it's the same rules for both. Once Sharding came out we started to more or less refer to CRZ and Sharding as Sharding collectively, since shards on live are realm agnostic. We're so jumbled up that we don't even really know what "realm" we're on in current expansion zones. 
---
If you already plan on playing Classic long term sharding is a complete non issue either way. The annoyance you feel dealing with sharding for the first few hours of your characters life is the same annoyance I'll feel dealing with the non-sharded version. We'll both exit the starting zones in the first couple of days and neither of us will really care after that. For this reason I'd rather have sharding but it doesn't really matter to me.
---
It will however matter to new players who don't know any better and quit because of the once in a lifetime clusterfuck a non-sharded launch will be. Losing players because of this will be a longterm loss to the entire Classic community and that's the only reason I even really participate in sharding discussions.
---
That aside I've still never heard a legitimate reason to not shard at launch, these are the reasons I've heard
---
* **I don't like it** - This is the best argument there is because it's honest
---
* **The world will be empty with sharding** - I'm not sure why people think Blizzard is going to make something ridiculous like 5 player shards. Both groups want the world to feel alive and full, sharding doesn't stop that
---
* **I don't trust them, they'll bring it back!** - Not trusting them is fine, but there's literally no reason to bring it back after launch, there's no fiscal reason, there's no gameplay reason. In fact sharding the full game after launch will be detrimental to both the gameplay experience and Blizzard's fiscal position as people (myself included) would leave in droves
---
* **They'll use it to save costs!** - That's not a thing. Blizzard uses cloud servers, they can configure them to whatever capacity they want/need
---
&gt; No one is entitled to do anything in the world of vanilla. Can't find any mobs to kill? Group up with some people or go somewhere else or get gud and out tag the rest of the competition.
---
This is incredibly ignorant about the state WoW in 2019.
---
Pop-caps changed throughout Vanilla (per Mark Kern's posts) to adapt to increasing player base. The player base at launch of 1.1 was tiny compared to any reasonable expected 2019 population at launch.
---
Everything you're talking about is only reasonable in a 2004 vacuum that will not exist.
---
This is one of the few instances where *not* making changes will actually lead to very un-Vanilla-like experiences.
---
That has not been my experience at all with the third timepiece. Never tried sailing. 
---
I think that there needs to at least be the illusion of permanence to get into one's character, and given that your server has announced it's shutting down as soon as classic launches, that's going to make it hard to be super invested in improving your character, which is what leveling is.
---
In contrast, on my server, they do obscure the player count. I tend to /who everyone in local chat, as a habit. People selling stuff, buying stuff, cracking jokes, and looking for groups even if I am not the right level to join the group. I /who everyone, out of habit. My server breaks /who, so a lot of the time, I cannot /who people I just do out of habit. and every time I /who my zone, it just returns 50 players, most of who are not in my zone. So I don't actually know the player count.
---
That said, I haven't had problems finding groups for dungeons. It seems like there are people all over the first 30 levels doing stuff. If you go to do the barrens quests, you often have to wait for samoflange, or you will be grinding herbs and see someone coming the other way doing the same thing, or see multiple alliance in ratchet, or find that there's reasonable competition for mobs around camp taurajo, specifically the thunder lizards and the raptors for the colored feather quest. 
---
The auction house for low level stuff is the liveliest I have ever seen, but that's not saying much because I started playing retail in wrath of the lich king. 
---
I do notice, a lot of the people I play with on the third timepiece really are committed to staying there. Maybe that's why my experience doesn't match yours. People are just more invested in what they see as a lasting place for their characters to exist. Fourth sail is just not that. At all. 
---
I remember when I unsubbed from wow, before my sub ran out, I played a dranei shaman up to 20 (or that's what I planned to do), just to get the "full" experience... and I hated it. Nothing was interesting or engaging, probably because I had already resolved to leave wow... maybe the same thing is happening on fourth sail?
---
Original WoW didn't have sharding either. And that's a much bigger change than simply changing a cap-number.
---
My point is they didn't just add it "because", they added it because of warmode which uses the sharding technology. Maybe it would have been too much work to have RP realm Warmode function differently than non RP-realms. My point was that they kept sharding out of RP realms entirely until Warmode.
---
And as the poster below pointed out I am not spreading misinformation, I acknowledged that they finally added sharding to RP realms.
---
&gt; Might be fun to you but to the masses, including me, that’s not fun. 
---
According to the upvotes (or lack thereof) on that comment I'm gonna have to go and say nope, you're not the majority.
---
Pick another class. You need a pet.
---
Tier list of priest healing weapons in Vanilla goes something like:
---
Ateish&gt;KT Mace&gt;C'thun Mace&gt;Faerlina Mace&gt;Spire Of Twilight&gt;AQ 40 Armament Staff&gt;The End of Dreams&gt;AQ 20 Hilt&gt;Benediction
---
After Benediction the next upgrade (though more of a side grade depending on your current OH) would be AQ20 Hilt off of Ossi (Gavel of Infinite Wisdom), which requires Exalted with CC.
---
After that with most guilds you're probably keeping AQ20 Hilt/Benediction until Faerlina Mace (Widow's Embrace). Maybe you'll get an AQ40 staff, but Regalia's are rare and shared with casters plus you need to be deep into AQ40 to even turn them in, a handful of very strong guilds with the ability to down C'thun will get the covered Scepter of the Fallen Prophet.
---
It's honestly very possible that some of the top guilds will have Priests that go Benediction-&gt;Scepter of the Fallen Prophet-&gt;Ateish/KT Mace
---
It's not quite a matter of "trust" per say, it's more like an analyzing of the current information.
---
The reason the "No changes" phrase took off like it did is because it's a principle. If people are led by principles, you can know what to expect from them in the future. "No changes" is the only truly firm, easy to stick to and predictable for the public, principle they had available. Seeing as how many of the people who quit over the years feel like they were forced to because of the changes made by the current team at Blizzard. And seeing as how sharding and loot trading fit in with that current team's philosophy much better than Classic's original philosophy, there's not a huge number of reasons to feel at ease with the direction things seem to be moving.
---
If they have it in at launch I fcking guarantee that they'll use it in other situations too. (AQ Event, guilds fighting over world bosses, city raids, streamer events, ...) 
---
Don't listen to all these complicit people who are telling you to stfu and wait for launch, that's what got retail to the point is it at. Complain now, loudly and clearly. No fucking sharding, ever, no matter the cost. 
---
Really stuck between Warlock and Priest, for different reasons. I mained a priest from Mid-BC through until BFA, and I loved being able to heal or be a damage class. For Warlock, they seemed to be in high demand, underated in their time, and pretty great at everything, usually guaranteed a raid spot, and pretty good in PVP (especially undead for racial). I don't mind if I heal or dps in Raids or dungeons, I want to be useful, and yet not get squashed in open world. I guess I saw Warlock as being closer to priests in cata with weaving dots, having lots of Utility, and is what I would be used to. Being a priest I -can- dps but will most likely just stick there healing. I've read the threads above, and they are great, but still doesn't help a decision. I love playing priests, and have an itch to return, but are Warlocks closer to what I (having started spriest late BC) percieve as similar to Spriests in terms of rotation and familiarity through Wrath and beyound? Might just be a /cointoss. 
---
They're completely different things.
---
CRZ is taking random people from randoms servers (that are not connected with yours) and putting them together in the same zone.
---
Sharding is taking people **from the same server** and spreading them among multiple instances *of the same zone*.
---
Than there's also connected realms that is Blizz version of server merges, but that can be considered like single servers since they work the same way.
---
So glad to see the absolute best boss guide creator return. Please don't stop. 
---
Thank you for the clarification, I did not have that level of detail!
---
Did you even play classic? You could top DPS with two buttons on mage and not even move for half the fights.... Roll that Retardin or whatever you're clearly going to do though :D
---
I don’t recall it being any different. Just different for each faction 
---
Blizzard introduced dynamic respawns in TBC, the very next expansion. If dynamic respawns aren't "blizzlike" then sharding is an out-of-this-world funserver atrocity.
---
There isn't, but god damn they should sell some "*truck nuts*" in the cosmetic shop, purchasable with wow token (or real money, cuz who's got time for wow tokens) and giving +10 stamina.  
---
Yeah it’s rough lol, not to mention getting ganked on the way in lol, you learn that run pretty well. 
---
&gt; or they want to just not have some douche spamming memes in /y for hours on end.
---
I think this is much more of a factor than some realize. Quite a few of my old guildies in Blacksky Company weren't terribly interested in role playing themselves, they just appreciated the more laid-back atmosphere of the RP server. Those who wanted to RP did so, those who didn't passed by without comment, everyone went home happy. I'm really looking forward to getting back to that in Classic.
---
Why not both?
---
&gt; They always went above the expected when it came to consumable use and raid preparation
---
How can they go above the absolute maximum?
---
I don't get how people dread STV PvP - The only time PvP in STV should be a problem, is if you're playing on a PvP server and you're not liking PvP, in that case you chose the wrong server?
---
&gt; it's interesting to hear the former vanilla WoW devs have no interest in working on the Classic WoW project. They would be too compelled to make changes they never got a chance to implement the first time around.
---
Thanks for the summary! I also loved watching this ClassiCast episode because I felt like it threw some much needed cold water on a lot of viewers' nostalgia for clearly broken things.
---
I've heard a lot of artists talk about the same problem: They're not satisfied with their “final” work because they know it can be so much better, but fans fall in love with that version and will actually fight you on it.
---
Vanilla wasn't balanced around raids. 
---
I said they are not the same thing, but again they follow the same rules as sharding for RP realms (which is the topic).
---
&gt; This is in addition to our existing rule that RP realms do not automatically fill areas using our Cross-Realm Zones system (although you can still enter an RP realm using CRZ if you're grouped with a player on an RP realm).
---
I've got a bit of a unique question: I'm currently weighing between a hunter and a pure prot warrior. Unfortunately I no longer have unlimited time anymore, but raiding is what I want to do.
---
I know these classes have drastically different leveling/pre-bis time, but I'm not worried about that as I can take as long as I want. My concern is more once I start raiding: does a tank take a large amount of time to maintain? I would have a gathering profession, but I fear all my free time will be solely for raiding and preparing for raids. I know hunter farm super easy, so I'm more concerned if I go prot.
---
Can any raid MTs/OTs weigh in on the time needed outside of raids?
---
Sometimes "No changes" isn't possible and you have to choose between the lesser of two (or three of four) evils.
---
I feel you. I installed and uninstalled over 25 games in the past 2 months. I only want to play a game where I'll invest time and build my char and then slaughter people, but every MMO is just asian style where you slice everything in a huge radius which is 0 fun. I gave up last week and will just wait for Classic. In the meantime probably just watch tv shows instead of playing games.
---
&gt;believe that Blizzard will do things they don’t like for the simple reason they don’t like them.
---
Never heard this reasoning on this forum.
---
&gt;They introduced them to RP servers in Aug of 1017.
---
Impossible. WoW had not yet been released back then ( ͡° ل͜ ͡°)
---
Personally I feel this entire discussion falls pretty flat since there are really just two ways it can end: (1) Blizzard stick to their official promises and principles that sharding is only considered for starting zones the first few weeks, or (2) Blizzard makes a U-turn and fails the project and the community. While I have lost a lot of trust in ActiBlizz in recent years, they have a team with dedication and respect to the Classic experience. I do not see sharding making it any farther than the starting zones the first few weeks, if even...
---
* Worst ingame report system in a video game
---
* Diablo Mobile
---
* Destroying Hots
---
* Greedy sales practices with their wow store
---
Those are plenty of reasons.
---
I will forever link to u/duckst0rm's [comment on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ab7ikk/remember_we_are_the_target_audience_for_the/ecydg8p/) because I think it's the most persuasive and sane take on this whole issue.
---
I don't remember their name but a tauren ele sham on Stormreaver-US was basically the king of PvP during bc.  He always had the best gear and would farm people outside MC/BWL/AQ.  He was truly feared.  It usually took a 2v1, 3v1, 4v1 to kill him etc lol. I wasn't exactly a PvP chump either - got up to R11 and in retail I'm a R1/Gladiator every xpac player.
---
My only **asterisk to classic PvP was 99% of players didn't have mechanics/keybindings mastered. I was a top PvP'er and I def clicked atleast 40% of my abilities. He was probably one of the few talented people to have 100% bind, addons, engineering, mechanics, etc.  Nowadays there will be a lot of players that good. 
---
Still worth noting tho that ele can be super scary   
---
On the contrary, I never met anyone on the starting zones that I became friends with later. Most of my friends were made from 30+, because you spend much more time in the higher level zones. 
---
I didn’t play until Wrath, and I love vanilla on private servers. It’s not just nostalgia 
---
I was tempted to try a private server and hit level 5 before realizing I have zero interest in investing my time in something that will most likely be hit hard before classic comes out with blizzard lawyers.
---
Six/seven month break from wow before classic is sounding good but this will be the longest I've ever not played and it's scary
---
Un'Goro is literally the opposite of this. It's one of the best quest areas if you just knock out your quests in a big circle around the zone. It's great for farming gold at 60; it's great for wPvP; there is real danger and real reward in this zone. It is the favorite zone of a lot of people for good reason.
---
&gt; Evoc is wonderful
---
You get evocation at level 20 -- it's part of the level 28 toolkit. I don't think you've even played a vanilla mage recently; you're all rose-colored glasses and garbled memories. Up above you're talking about frostbolt doing more damage because you got a staff with more int (wow a 0.15% incease to crit chance!) and a low-level staff giving you 150hp (15 stamina!) -- nothing like that drops until the upper 40s. You get so many details wrong that it's obvious you're talking out of your ass.
---
Try taking off your rose-colored glasses and getting some relevant recent experience before you call people a troll for disagreeing with you.
---
Oops, thanks for pointing that out! And yea I share your opinion. I wasn't specifically trying to take sides, just pointing out that Blizzard has in the past made a concerted effort to keep sharding out of places it doesn't make sense.
---
i was an annoying 13 y/o and would do this with a friend in every AV we joined. on average 3-4 would fall for it...
---
glad to see i am not the only one ;)
---
I recommend [this spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVVzmLxoVo) for leveling DW. You won't use demoralizing shout much at all while leveling apart from tanking so no need to spec for it. Improved battle shout should be about a 0.5% dps increase per point invested, which is a lot better than the alternative options at that level.
---
Dual Wield Specialization being 5/5 changes offhand weapon damage modifier from 0.5 to 0.625, which ends up being worth about 1.5% extra dps per point spent. If in classic you can /sit to get crit then it will be better to take enrage immediately, but if you can't then dual wield spec 4/5 to reach the next talent tier and then take death wish and max out enrage so you can max out flurry. Take bloodthirst immediately then max out dual wield specialization and then start investing in Arms like [this.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVG0bhbZVVzmxxoVo)
---
:O
---
So the problem is that sharding **100%** fits in the original team's philosophy. They just didn't have access to the technology.
---
Mark Kern has repeatedly said that they fiddled with pop-caps and other server changes in ways to better adapt to changing population levels. The devs from back then have repeatedly gone on record to talk about the headaches revolving keeping realms playable and all the ways in which they wished they could solve lag and stability issues.
---
Sharding and the other server technologies are only one point on a long line of the same design principles that extend all the way back to Vanilla.
---
It's the community that is falsely creating these ridiculous categories, deciding *a priori* what's valid or what isn't valid.
---
It's gate-keeping mixed with purity-testing. It's an obsession for purity where none exists (or even existed.)
---
The changes being implemented are designed to make Classic viable *in the long term.* We should all welcome this. I'd quote from u/duckst0rm's post, but you should really just [read the whole thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ab7ikk/remember_we_are_the_target_audience_for_the/ecydg8p/)
---
1+
---
Shouldn’t even be grinding in the first place if you’re trying to be efficient. There’s plenty of quests in the game to never grind. 
---
How was BFA? I beta tested, but it seemed....lacking. I find myself wondering about the finished product without wanting to buy a sub or watch YouTube videos. 
---
Right? I got my rogue to 40 in like the last 2 weeks. It makes it so much worse lol
---
Yep, with sharding at least they don't really have much of a choice if they want to ease current players into the Classic world. Reasonable to assume the community would be quite a bit more understanding if that was the only change mentioned, but loot trading seems arbitrary, and when the decisions start to look arbitrary it's hard to imagine what principles are being used, if any. Makes the future look uncertain, which will lead to speculation and fighting.
---
There's a lot of truth in this statement. My first few days of minecraft were the best because everything was new.
---
I'm still looking forward to wow classic though. 
---
i really like some parts of WoW and i've recently levelled up a rogue and a hunter to level 20. should i continue playing the current servers or try classic when it comes out?
---
playing for about 9 hours a week with some donations to keep me up with the others.
---
p.s. figured i shouldn't create a topic and just ask here, sorry if misplaced
---
Considering they were $2 about 2 years ago, I'd say so too. 
---
Wiped so many times on Nef due to the priests not listening and dotting the fuck out of me....
---
Yeah, still a fully stacked reck bomb is 5 melee hits + whatever seal or weapon procs.  Easy one-shots with a bit of gear depending on the opponent. 
---
Don't forget to stun first, kids.  Or at least attack from behind to avoid blocks/parries
---
1000% this! I want to know so I can book it off work, the way I've been gushing about it I know there's atleast 2 co-workers that want to play too lol
---
Sorry, but he's right. Vanilla was basically blizzard not knowing what the fuck they were doing regarding class and spec balance. Which they attempted to fix with TBC.
---
Thanks!
---
still totally worth it
---
I built a beast computer when vive was coming out.
---
Now it's just a decent computer. Gotta love the future proofing that comes with building a beast PC.
---
&gt;In conclusion, BfA is a professional theater with all manner of props and resources that can be used to expand your imagination and create whatever it is you want to see. In comparison, Classic is some gammy high school drama class with an extremely small pool of props to pull from and an oppressive teacher who limits every creative decision you make. It's really not great for RP.
---
Peter Jackson had relatively limited resources with which to make the Lord of the Rings trilogy. He had to get pretty creative a lot of the time; lots of playing with perspective and fudging shots *just so* to make it look right without spending a bunch of money he didn't have on it.
---
When he was making The Hobbit trilogy he could basically just throw money at whatever problems arose until they went away.
---
One of these trilogies is still regarded as a cinematic masterpiece and a brilliant work of storytelling that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. The other was a CGI dumpster fire.
---
The best stories - indeed the best art - often comes from talented individuals having to work around certain (sometimes significant) limitations in order to create their vision. Role playing is, at its most fundamental level, little more than collaborative storytelling. And while Classic doesn't have all the bells and whistles BFA does, it has more than enough for that sort of talented individuals to work their magic.
---
I see that point, but they have a reason for loot trading, can you think of any other reasons to use sharding (you know, aside from shitting on all servers and using sharding to deal with all the low pop servers which would be shooting classic in the foot)
---
&gt; My point is they didn't just add it "because", they added it because of warmode which uses the sharding technology. 
---
They didn't, you're misinformed or willingly spreading misinformation. [Proof](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616622232?page=2#post-40)
---
&gt; There are still limits, of course; we don't want playing on an RP realm to mean you can't properly experience core game content due to low FPS or heavy input lag. As such, all Legion zones (including all of the Broken Isles, the Broken Isles version of Dalaran, and soon, Argus) will still have sharding active, as they do on non-RP realms. 
---
Warmode and sharding have nothing to do with one another except a PvP flag.
---
&gt; My point was that they kept sharding out of RP realms almost entirely until Warmode.
---
Almost entirely is the same way servers were sharded before Warmode was introduced. Which means current content got sharded for the benefit of "server stability". 
---
The signs are in the sky!
---
OP point is that Blizzard can take away sharding when they want, he used RP realms as an example of that.
---
Your blue post says that Blizz will limit CRZ on RP realms for the same reason they limit sharding, this is not relevant because CRZ won't ever be in Classic, only sharding for a limited period.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted to hell, but there are some classes/specs that are able to have hybrid versions and still get most of what you want. 
---
For example, ret paladin can spec 21/0/30 to get max vengeance, returned mana from crit heals, and all the regular ret talents.  You'll be fine healing as that spec, perhaps 80-90% as effective as the typical full holy/prot healer.  But then you can swing your floppy hammer on the weekends, NBD, just switch gear. 
---
Other classes are similar, especially elemental/resto shaman (30/0/21) healing fine with heal gear, or Druid 1/29/21 doing basically anything.  Priest is a bit tougher but shadow priest DO have a role in raids but often only one at a time.  
---
A feral and rogue would rip through the levels with minimum downtime, too bad you would both need leather
---
Uh, excuse me sir, we will not tolerate logic around here, please allow me to direct you to this wonderful selection of pitchforks.
---
Alliance out numbered horde in vanilla.
---
I'd like to either play pally or warrior. Which one should I choose? Main a mage in bfa and a monk before that. I just really want to wear the og lightbringer set. It's my favorite set of all time
---
petopia, pleb
---
I seem to remember this actually was introduced in Wrath, but no official source to back this up (only Wowpedia http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Spawn ), but that system wasn't anywhere like the modern iteration or what i've seen being used on pservers. In Wrath (or possibly TBC) you could only make mobs spawn a bit faster, later on this was changed so that certain mobs (needed for a Q for example and not a named mob) can be forced to respawn every second (if you can kill them fast enough, if none are up, they will always force spawn), this very rapid respawning  was also used on several pservers and really changes the experience (and not for the better sadly). 
---
What part of the UI have they changed
---
Any suggestions on good Classic prep YouTube channels? I’ve exhausted all of my content for the channels I follow. Just can’t get enough!
---
Me too. I had the cheapest Dell with intel HD graphics. Everything was set to 0 or low 😂
---
You are not alone :).
---
How does group speed leveling work in classic? 
---
Saying that 'having 1k+ people in the starting zones will break the game' is just another indicator that someone is clueless. 
---
You can easily level up to level 5 just by exploring alone, which means you don't have to kill a single mob or loot a single item. If you are that hell-bent on getting ahead of the curve you can just do that instead (and btw, if you didn't know this, you won't get ahead anyway, sorry to break it to you.)
---
All these 'negatives' people like to point out with higher caps are easily circumvented, and some aren't even negatives at all. In fact there are way more positives than negatives:
---
1. You can find groups much faster, which in facts counters one of the main negative aspects that retail fanboys seem to have with vanilla. So there's that.
---
2. High pop realms provide a 'buffer' against the tourist exodus: even if half the people leave, the realm will still be playable. Not the case if the cap is very low. Playing with less than 1k online on a realm isn't very fun. Nor does it feel like a real 'world'. When the tourists leave, and realms drop below 1k, people WILL reroll to higher-pop realms, resulting in a few stable highpop realms and many more dead lowpop realms. (Exactly what has happend to retail btw.)
---
3. Everything is much more epic all-around. Huge fights between guilds when worldbosses spawn, more city raids. STV is an absolute slaughterhouse. All these things are the STRENGTHS of vanilla, and a high pop number reinforces these strengths.
---
4. No sharding, ever. Because fuck sharding.
---
Is it really worth sacrificing all of these advantages just to level a bit faster at launch? If your answer to that is yes, I'd urge you to reconsider whether vanilla is really the game you want, after all.
---
This game hooked me right in way before level max. 
---
In one word: friction.
---
In retail you want to gain a level so you do a bunch of easy clustered quests on auto pilot.
---
In Classic you want to level so you have find whatever few quests there are and travel extensively to complete each. Then you're over pulling and realize you need better gear and new spells so you have to farm gold too. Storage is an issue so it's going to take a few separate runs maybe. Buys you a new weapon, except now you have to up its weapon skill.
---
Sure, experienced players know enough to sidestep most of it but many are in for a surprise. Not only is it not only nostalgia, but even in 2019 it's still going to be a ton of raw fun for unassuming new comers to Classic.
---
Blue post says it will limit sharding on RP realms for the same reason they limit CRZ (limiting CRZ came first). And yes I am correcting the fact that the OP believes that sharding was out-right removed from RP realms (it never was). Clarifying what actually hapepend in the OP is kind of relevant to the discussion. CRZ is not the exact topic, but it is tied to how Blizzard uses both CRZ and Sharding in relation to RP realms, and the reasons behind both are the same. 
---
It's just ramp tanking, put the pally with his invuln hammer up there ffs. 
---
Bonus points for anyone that knows what I'm talking about :)
---
Properly geared Priests are not squishy in PvP.
---
Are there hubs in Thousand Needles and The Badlands for alliance?  I'd like to do them if there are.
---
To be fair, loot trading isn't objectively arbitrary. Many of modern WoWs systems are designed to remove the need for customer support interactions, including loot trading. Not having loot trading in the game means an influx of customer support tickets ( of which these are a particular annoyance since they require consent from multiple parties, log checking for validity, etc. ) and a need to hire or allocate additional support staff specifically for issues that will only exist on classic. I'm not saying that justifies it, but it's a financial decision and it does make sense in that way. I'm hopeful loot trading doesn't make it in due to community feedback but it's not one of the fights I'd pick as far as potential changes are concerned.
---
I'm not a no changes purist, but changing class balance would not only require rebalancing all content, which they have emphatically stated they will not do, it will also destroy one of the fundamental best parts of vanilla-the class and faction asymmetry.  
---
If any rebalancing of off/hybrid specs were to happen it could and should only be done in post naxx 1.13 type content and it should only be done as a copy your toon to a new server manner so classic can remain for those who want to enjoy it.  
---
Let's not kill classic again like tbc did a decade ago when we've waited and campaigned so hard to get it back.
---
Okay so I wasn't fully informed of how exactly sharding was handled on RP servers (thanks to u/BattleNub89 for clarifying) but it provides the same point (maybe even a better one). They just sharded current content as it was built with sharding in mind. The old zones that don't need sharding in RP servers apparently **still** don't have sharding in older zones which is an even better sign for Classic.
---
So you're right, I was wrong and was spreading mis-information, my mistake.
---
No.
---
Well defensive dispel is very important but that doesn't mean you have to be the one doing. Just like mortal strike, and poly morph and heals are very important but only certain classes can do them. Shaman is a strong group pvp class but is probably squishier than a priest really. Blessed recovery/inner fire/shields/fear combine to make priest a pretty hardy pvp class and you can be in the thick of it ok. Shaman on the hand really wants to kite and stay away - if a well geared warrior/rogue is on top of you you're basically shut down.  
---
The strength of Shaman is interrupts, burst damage, kiting, WF support and backup heals. Priest is all about the offensive/defensive dispells, fear bombs, mind controls (off cliffs/ledges), mana burns and heals.
---
And 3 days ago itd be 3 more days away. Not a year.
---
I'm more going into the general perceptions of the public than I am trying to argue that point. People have limited information and so people are going with "feel" a fair amount for information gathering. The game designers started to truly loose sight of what made the original game great at about the exact time sharding was added to the game. "It marked the beginning of the end for WoW, will this change be the beginning of the end for Classic? Who knows?"
---
I responded to another post moving forward with the principle argument so I won't repeat it, but you should read that too, because it also works as a response to your post.
---
Do you really trust current blizzard, the people who brought us BfA to do it right?  You'd be better off waiting for a TBC server.
---
I watched one that talked about healing and how each class did in raids, dungeons, and PvP.
---
Haven't watched a whole lot else except the same ones I've been watching a while.  Madseason has amazing stuff about items or people or events that happened.  He's like the Bob Ross of wow videos.
---
I forget the other ones offhand
---
&gt; this very rapid respawning was also used on several pservers and really changes the experience (and not for the better sadly).
---
I'd agree with that. 
---
But like you said, this wasn't the system they initially used. Personally I'd want a system more like the BC/Wrath iteration of dynamic respawn. That way it does alleviate some of the problems, but doesn't allow for easily abusable/immersion breaking shit like what you described.
---
Welcome to vanilla.
---
He's also probably playing alliance on North Dale where the raids on the alliance side are called "stonetalon mountain" and "ashenvale" and the "bosses" have no loot tables.
---
&gt; Why are you refusing to consider a perspective that differs from yours?
---
That's a funny way to say "pointing out that a response is completely different to what was asked for".
---
&gt; There's a gameplay element that many of us find quite enjoyable that would be compromised by balancing the specs. 
---
That's not what OP asked about. Also if the specs were balanced the same people could feel special trying to make a tri-spec work or a toon with no talents or a holy paladin in all leather or something else equally unintended. There will always be ways to make a bad character as long as it is remotely vanilla-like.
---
&gt; There's a whole avenue of gameplay that we'd miss out on if Blizzard rebalanced the specs.
---
You could find something equally bad to try to play, I am sure. As a bonus it might be something bad that hasn't been tried thousands or millions of times before. Unless you think you will be the first person in history to try to play a ret paladin?
---
&gt; It's fine if you aren't interested in that gameplay. Just be honest: you want to take that style of gameplay away from us because you want to have an easier time maining them.
---
I think it's more that nobody cares about the special snowflakes who think they are expressing their unique artistic souls by picking the bad menu option off a list of three. Especially not if we were trying to have a conversation about improving the menu before you barged in with your unsolicited opinion.
---
It's completely different depending if you're talking about levelling, pub BGs, pre made BGs, lvl 60 blues/T1, or T2.5+.
---
No changes. Tyvm.
---
On a more serious note, I don't think they need to retune anything as things will be way different than on pservers. For starters you won't have the same population than you can get on the 2 "big" pservers.
---
This will lead to smaller guilds having some measure of trouble clearing the raids early on. At least MC. I don't expect casual guilds to fully clear MC less than a month after release.
---
Lol “the Bob Ross of wow videos” perfectly put. Yeah I’ve been watching Madseason for quite awhile. I’ve also been watching a lot from Tips Out, Kargoz, Nixxiom, Frostadamus, as well as a couple others, but those are the main ones for sure!
---
1-3 hours a day and 5+ hours at the weekend? Bro stop acting like that's not enough time... 
---
Shimmering Flats in needles. Quest givers are spread out in badlands.
---
Classic isn't out yet 
---
Maybe dont tell other people what is the point of the game for them pal
---
reeeee stop liking what I dont like
---
I haven't played WoW since WotLK so I can't comment on these new expansions. I just feel that the classic experience had very little to do with the particular meta of that time - I don't think anyone is really feeling nostalgic about being pigeon-holed into a very specific role. The classic WoW experience had a lot more to do with community and the feeling that nothing came easy so every little success felt like it mattered, IMO.
---
I got up in the thirties then did the same thing, same reason.... 
---
If you want my personal opinion, I agree with you. GM tickets are inelegant both financially and gameplay wise. But at the same time if it's just "thrown in" without concern for how it's implemented it could do a giant amount of damage to the game in far reaching ways. Something like throwing a big, cheap, ugly spoiler on a $300,000 car. You could invest the time and cash to think it through ahead of time and make sure the end product is improved. I heard The way this should be implemented on a thread the other day. "Everyone who rolled on the item needs to still be in the group and agree that the trade can happen, otherwise it can't." It fits the community atmosphere of Classic perfectly keeping everything in the open and to have a solid barrier preventing players from screwing eachother.
---
Also vanilla depended a lot on what class you were facing against. On my crappy geared Arms warrior I’d stomp geared rogues mainly because of overpower. Warlocks are great but can get their ass beat by rogues. I think mage might be the overall strongest because of its CC and kiting abilities. 
---
THIS!!! I remember walking into Silverpine Forrest for the first time. I had goosebumps. 
---
No, the price you pay for playing a non-resto druid is that your character looks the same as every other druid of the same spec regardless of gender, appearance customization, or gear. Your badass geared-out male level 60 feral cat looks exactly the same as a naked level 15 female feral cat.
---
So then we would need to kill a female orc named Gamora before we can do this quest then.
---
It can come out September 20th though
---
Pserver my friend
---
Why would changing class balance require a content revamp? 1.12 is not the end all be all of classic, it represents only the ending of an expansion that was constantly changing. It has well known problems with meme specs and some classes just being better than the rest. I’m imagining 1.13 with a nerf to warriors, an improvement to paladin and Druid tanking, and bringing memespecs like retribution and balance up a notch.
---
I really question what these people even want out of classic. They want their own version of the game and fuck everyone else.
---
Let people play what they want. If youre gonna be a min maxing killjoy then stick to your killjoy guild.
---
With or without sharding you'll suffer through those horrible 4 hours. With or without sharding I'll suffer through those horrible 4 hours. After that we'll be be enjoying shardingless Classic for years.
---
Those other people trying it out at launch and quitting because they can't actually do anything? Sharding will chase those people away for good which is bad for the Classic community.
---
I don't even care about sharding (as I said, it won't matter after about 4 hours anyways), I do care about chasing away potential members of the Classic community though.
---
If you want the Soul Stone, just ask a warlock
---
Arcanite reaper a lvl 58 blue was better.
---
idiot
---
It’s tell me what the damn numbers mean JOHNSON
---
JUST TELL ME WHAT THE DAMN NUMBERS MEAN JOHNSON
---
This really exposes how elitists view wow. Its just work to you at this point and its sad.
---
At this point I think there's too much involved with balancing classes to just say balance classes.  A lot of classes were balanced until they got BC talents and itemization.
---
I think just adding dual spec would be a much more reasonable thing to have in classic.
---
This is #1 IMO. This is something that we can never get back and the thing that scares me that it may be what drives my fond memories the most.
---
Completing all the Deathknell quests and then opening up map for first time and seeing how massive the world truly is. Blizzard did an excellent job making most zones in Vanilla look and feel so different. It felt so big and scary and that's why finally being able to walk into the next zone without getting 1-shot felt like you were truly progressing.
---
5 hits is not the same as 500k
---
to 3sec
---
I think that a modified loot trading system is the best middle ground ( A pop-up box requiring all players who rolled on the item to confirm before a trade goes through, but this could be problematic in it's own way in PUGs ).
---
I remember as a Tauren shaman, having never left the Barrens except to get to Orgrimmar -- trying to figure out the quest for the totem that took me to Westfall.  WESTFALL!  I had no clue how to get there, the quest was a bit of a riddle -- and it was WONDERFUL!  You had to dive in the waters until you died, use your ankh, grab the item, and die again.
---
THOSE were the quests to complete!
---
And honestly, if you were in a group for a dungeon, and if the lead / group asked, "Do you have this skill trained, this totem, etc.?" -- folks were kicked out and told to learn your class.
---
But those quests made you *that* class.
---
Theyve invested so much time into this game (job) that they get triggered by people who havent done the same.
---
ofc not... most casuals wont be 60 in a month
---
Hate to be that guy but level 15 can't be a cat
---
Same here. Im really hoping classic release will be better than this. Pservers have a mix of cool players but the toxic poopsockers are quite loud.
---
At this point in the beta everyone thought that warriors was the worst class of them all because no one had figured out how to spec them. Indalamar made the video and showed that warriors was actually 1 of the best classes in the game at that point, so blizzard nerfed them after the video
---
I played WoW for years, and never got past level 10 as an Alliance character.
---
So on the private servers, I created a human, a dwarf and a NE, and did ALL of the starting zones, and then took one to 60 by doing specific zones, then the other one did all of the other zones to 60.  It allowed me to see Alliance's version of Winterspring, Feralas, EPL and WPL, and Searing Gorge.
---
It was worth it, as I always rolled Horde and always will roll Horde.  It was nice to just sit back and explore the zones with a different perspective.
---
In other words you want every class to be almost the same.

What you view as a problem I view as fundamental to the experience I enjoy.  The more classes are balanced the more every class begins to feel like a reskin of the others.   
---
Key points are that 2H has an easier time acquiring good weapons ( You only have one slot to upgrade and a quest item that lasts anywhere from 10 to 17 levels ). The other is that 2H is far, far more efficient in terms of damage input vs output because it gets more mileage out of hamstring kiting and relatively has less downtime. The majority of people leveling on private servers are using /sit macros to proc blood craze which won't work on retail Classic. If you're really set on DW I'd recommend doing it before you acquire WW axe and then picking it back up again after it's lifespan is over. It really is just an enormous QoL item for a long time.
---
In the same boat, always been horde, but think that Alliance would make the experience new and more likely to give me longer term satisfaction as it will not feel like replaying 20 years ago and actual feel new. 
---
Back on Nost I said fuck that noise and just killed centaur in Desolace for hours.
---
Defensive dispel is locks biggest counter, which paladins have and shamans do not. Also you have dwarf priest fear ward, so it's really a wash.
---
Vanilla wasn't *balanced* at all. They flat out didn't do the math. You can't look at pserver figures 15 years later and tell me they *intentionally* designed fury warrior to do 5x the DPS of most other classes.
---
The game's official answer to a GM ticket is not "go check wowhead", the game's official answer to "I don't know what to do with this quest" is to go check fan sites that have made content guides. GM tickets are to deal with actual game problems, not explaining or guiding users through content they can't figure out.
---
First time our guild brought him down, I sat at my computer and cried because it was just damn awesome 😊😊😊
---
Casual raiding guilds are so frustrating.  You will be in MC for 4+ hours and perhaps not even finish it in one night.  The turnover in casual guilds is the worst because some people will join, get gear and leave.  Other people will quit outright because the guild can’t clear the content.  This will trickle down to the guild leader who will end up disbanding the guild before the AQ patch.
---
Casual guilds tend to have flakier players causing more downtime trying to replace them. You want a hardcore guild that expects all players to come on time and prepared.  You sound like you just need to have a good raid time/ day and your set.  
---
The hardcore guild will get through MC/BWL/ Ony in 2-3 hrs and be done with it.  You might have to come more prepared but the clear times make up for it.  
---
Start a weekly ZG run for yourself filled with guildies and PUGs.  That way you set the date and time and will have no trouble filling the rest of the raid.

The post you responded to isn't referring to pugs though. They're referring to in-guild competition for the premiere tank spot, for which there will be competition in ALL guilds.
---
When even this thread gets turned into a shard of one 😅
---
Curious if they are there or modified in the chinese version of the Cinematic.
---
Ok. Play GURPS.
---
None of my friends play WoW, nor do they understand my hype for classic. I'm sitting here, waiting to play classic, just wishing one of my friends would play with me, but all of the type of people who hear the word "Warcraft" or "WoW" and are immediately turned off by it, even having never tried the game.
---
I've been a loner in WoW for 12 years now, and a loner in real life for 21. FeelsBadMan
---
&gt; And your experience in your 1 or 2 guilds is not statistically more relevant than someone like me who has seen good things regarding hybrid specs.
---
ummmm sure everyone elses experience means nothing compared to the god of all knowledge that is you. I will trust your math of a good ret pally doing 75-90% of a good warrior/rogues damage. seems legit
---
the other 39 people aren't there solely for this one guys pleasure.
---
I just need to be 17 and have infinite free time again
---
I remember when polymorph wouldn’t restrict the movement of the target. After 30 sec....”uhh where did the sheep go?” and then a bunch of mobs would be on your group. That was fun. 
---
It's a steaming pile of horseshit.

Wallwalking and walljumping to explore the secret parts of the world.

/r/lostredditors 
---
How is sharding cost cutting? They run on cloud servers and can be configured however they need.
---
Iirc they are mostly tied to calming down the elements on Azuremist and Bloodmist Islands, but otherwise similar.
---
Same as you! But goddamn was RDR2 amazing. Best single player experience I’ve ever had it a game 
---
&gt; The game designers started to truly loose sight of what made the original game great at about the exact time sharding was added to the game.
---
Anyone who would malign sharding just because of a vague feeling that around the same time the game started losing its way need to get checked then.
---
Whole reason for the post is that I was quitting pservers until classic launch, and decided I can play now and play later and still enjoy myself.
---
Anthem or whatever it's called looks fun though
---
Depends what you want out of it. I find it very similar to Legion in that the main activities outside of raiding/pvp are Mythic+ and WQs. Whether that's good or bad is up to you.
---
Wait what you could fight the Other faction in a raid !?
---
Oh i just remember having a 2 man arena team with a ret paladin and my warrior... it may have been wotlk, it was a while ago xD
---
I see what you're saying. But I disagree. Not every class and not every build needs to be an apex at their role to be valuable to a raid.
---
&gt;And your experience in your 1 or 2 guilds is not statistically more relevant than someone like me who has seen good things regarding hybrid specs. 
---
&gt;And I bet they are not doing like &lt; 50% dps of a pure dps. At equal skill and gear you probably rather do like 75-90% of the dps, plus add some utility.
---
Doing 75-90% DPS compared to a somewhat competent rogue, mage, warrior or warlock as a ret paladin is literally mathematically impossible unless you massively outgear and/or you use consumables while they don't. Ret also doesn't bring any utility that isn't already being provided by your holy paladins or off tanks.
---
It's clear that you don't know shit about hybrids.
---
Lol. No details confirmed on those?
---
Go play on an instant 60 server, they have battlegrounds waiting for you to test out your character
---
there was a bug with overlapping raid IDs, but only 40 could enter
---
and if that hit a aliiance+horde raid who tried to enter at the same time =&gt; fun
---
Ohh trust me ally gets ganked too lol. Does horde not have GYs in searing gorge or burning steppes?
---
Do NOT follow this guy's advice. Holy shit, I've never seen someone so completely wrong. Leveling as Protection is objectively worse in every way. You kill slower AND take more damage due to the low damage. There is no upside. Tanking instances in Arms or Fury is fine because threat scales well when you're lower level.
---
Blizzard isn't paying you to defend them. You get that, right? You aren't an employee. 
---
While the world itself may not be completely new there are certainly new things you notice each time you progress a character, which makes it "new" in a sense. Especially if you play a new class or run dungeons/level in zones you didn't do too often back in vanilla.
---
Most people agree with you. Plus, blizzard said no balancing so this whole post is a waste lol.
---
Somewhere between 16 and 20 for allies, most people will stick with it until they pvp at 19 or do VC at 16 to 20, before realizing how long the road is and giving up.  My guess is tones of allies will attempt the deadmines at 15 to 17 and get really frustrated and quit lol
---
What? They’re both confirmed to be in classic
---
I remember wandering in there and seeing no dragon and thinking, “is this unfinished content?”
---
Levelled a human male in retail and on on private servers. Now I want to see some different animations, also I like their 1h shield animation since female humans actually RAISE THEIR SHIELD UP when not attacking. 
---

---
rock paper scissors mushrooms
---
Actually the client will be current, so you could totally utilize the rig. 
---
I think it will be easier to make friends in classic than it has been in retail for a long time. Having to find your own groups and play with people on your own server encourages people to talk and be friendly. So you might not be a WoW loner for much longer!
---
The world needs people like you to keep us all honest. o7
---
Out of curiosity, why do people want the game guides? I never used them in game. If I recall, they became mostly useless after a few patches. Plus since we’re starting with 1.12 won’t the content of them be mostly obsolete? Is it a nostalgia thing or is there a legit reason I don’t know about? I’m not trying to troll or anything I’m 100% asking a question.
---
You're arbitrarily setting up differences between them to say "they're not the same, so there's nothing to worry about."
---
It's the same technology, used for the same reason - to sterilize the environment to eliminate obstacles to player progress.
---
The scope is different, but we have yet to see the true scope (meaning how widespread sharding would be, how long it would last, how often it might be reused in the future, and how many other things it opens up).
---
In my experience, its more about having a consistent schedule than a ton of free time. Good guilds have a raid schedule - if you can play during those times consistently then you have enough time. An example raid schedule could be: T/Th 9:00PM-11:30PM.
---
If you're enjoying it, why not?
---
Exactly what i have been thinking.
---
Yeah i really like gathering aswell. But being able to shoot of some stun grenades feels just as good, maby even better!
---
I’m lost, can’t find the poll results. I just see that my stuff was recorded.
---
Until October? Summer ends in September.
---
Yeah i guess i will just make an alt for gathering. I wont be in a rush to 60 anyways
---
I got them because i was really young when i played classic so i Figured they might help out a bit when it comes to faster lvling and whatnot. And i also just like those old school guides
---
Loner rhymes with stoner, so we can definitely be friends as long as you play horde and play on Eastern Time Zone server as well as PVP server. I could be your Tank Buddy, everybody has a tank buddy.
---
No, details are not confirmed. The only loot trading that *is* confirmed is for raids [if you listen to the panel](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2373), and everyone here seems to think it's for the entire game. Also, there were multiple styles of the loot trading system and we don't know for a fact with variation they're going to go with if they did expand it beyond raids. As for sharding, they've only said they are [**looking at using sharding**](https://youtu.be/8MMn544Jsmo?t=1744) as a temporary fix for launch issues and to avoid dead servers. They could come up with something else before launch. *We don't know*.
---
So I repeat, no **details** confirmed.
---
Good thinking. Since i am going engi later on in the game, i might aswell just go engineering from the start.
---
Baldurs Gate 2!!!!
---
It won't be that much overkill. Don't underestimate how laggy 40+ raids and BG's can be. 
---
Thank you, you made me to be a warrior, sir. 
---
i think the -10 lvl column just needs to be deleted and the -11 and -12 columns shifted over to the left one 
---
But those will be in Classic?
---
Some other comments have suggested that since i am going engineer later on i might just aswell skip skinning. I wont be able to gather much gold from light and medium leather and when i will get to the Heavy hides i will change to engi anyways. Not to mention how many people will be Skining/Mining early on. The auction house will be packed with that stuff, therefor cheap.
---
I think one of the coolest small things early on, was having the Ironforge-Stormwind flight path go directly over the high-level  Burning Steppes/Searing Gorge zones.
---
I remember looking down from the Gryphon wondering what the hell was even down there?  
---
It looked truly epic and inhospitable as a young clothie
---
I bet i will be able to make something from scopes. It is definetly not the most profitable profession early on but i think it will be worth it in the long run. And i will probably be able to make some off mining. Just gotta spend more time gather nodes than normal.
---
Don't touch the game, let us play and let's discuss this in a year and see if we want changes. But for now, please blizzard, stay away from that code base. 
---
zero because classic?
---
I've heard they are using the legion engine and textures for classic wow, so the requirements might be a little higher. 
---
Ahh. The guide is fun to read through but I don’t recall it helping with leveling in any way.
---
Oh, I wasn't aware the internet was being shut down anytime soon.
---
I think your confusing "judgement" with critical response with hope to change the development process. Maybe it gets old and is overstated but the constant posts and critiques of issues like Sharding or Loot Sharing is aimed to prevent poor decisions from being made by Blizz before too late. See BFA as an example of poor decisions being made.. But what else would you have the fanbase do? sit here silently and hope they dont mess it up (they have been messing a lot up as of late..)? Of course people are going to be loud about it, its really the only (if small) chance we have to affect anything.
---
 I spend my time out with friends, meditating, going to festivals, clubs, raves, and being outdoors.
---
Ha! Freak
---
There's a "Classic" graphics setting that is different though. Did you play the demo?
---
lmfao oops, im subbed to /r/worldofpvp as well, my bad
---
Classic Community: Blizzard failed tuning things for BfA!  
---
Also Classic Community: I trust Blizzard to be competent enough to retune Classes/Raids in Classic without messing everything up.  
---
Imo: It ain’t really broke, so we shouldn’t try to “fix” it.
---
I was excited now i just fear all the bfa kids come and ruin it in a year or less
---
I disagree. I've been playing a new char a ton on a private server and theres a surprisingly high amount of people looking for groups for dungeons or quests and even people fighting over a quest mob. I'm almost lvl 30 so there are tons in the mid range right now on lights hope.
---
Well its not arena. So you can play literally whatever the hell you want to and it'll be OK cuz someone else can just play whatever class you aren't playing.
---
If you play rsham, you'll probably have a priest or two in your group as the other healer. If you play priest, you'll probably have a sham or two lying around. There is just no point ruling out a class cuz "no defensive dispel". PLUS shamans have an OFFENSIVE dispel, which is fucking glorious, and you have cure poison / cure disease, which is enough to destroy the soul of any rogues out there. (lol blind is a poison in 1.12)
---
You just explained my exact feelings on why I liked vanilla so much. I am well aware that my personal excitement isn’t from nostalgia alone, albeit it’s a factor, but I can never explain exactly what it is... you’re right, it was more the challenge that sucked away those hours.
---
We didn’t know... WE DIDNT KNOW!!!
---
What's a reskin? Is rogue a reskin of warrior? Is mage a reskin of warlock? Just because it's a ranged dps or melee dps or healer or tank doesn't mean it doesn't have its own way of being played, its own tools, its own class quests, its own strengths and weaknesses. 
---
This whole "all classes are viable that means they're all just reskins of each other" argument is baseless. Your class identity can't be "able to dps". 
---
Skinning is mainly for vendoring but it only shines in the later levels indeed. If you plan on going engineering befor lvl 60 by all means drop skinning
---
You can always download retail WoW (It's f2p below lvl20) and check out how it works, it is going to be a fairly accurate estimation about the performance you will get, especially on the mid-low settings. 
---
Also downscaling the resolution to 1080p should not be a major issue if there are some performance issues.
---
The fact that you're here bitching about it on Reddit...
---
i recently jumped on a pserver and honestly, its so different that it 100% feels excellent to explore. knowing how big things are and whats round the corner doesn't ruin anything in my experience. there have been thousands upon thousands of subtle, minor changes over the years (and a few huge ones) and you dont notice a lot of them. going back to 1.12 will be a magical experience. As long as bliz doesnt cock it up, i'm convinced that the entire WoW community will have a 2-3 week period of just nostalgia induced dopamine highs.
---
That's true, you don't need to be the best to be viable, but you do need to be viable. I'd love to see a rebalancing of the classes with a post naxx content patch in the future. 
---
typical troll - nothing more to see here. 
---
No direct criticisms or instances of failure (lord we can all find something). Just "Activision-Blizzard" sucks and if you don't agree then your dumb.
---
My response was absolutely pertinent to the OP. The OP asked for what changes could make specs more fun, and I suggested a change in mindset could make them more fun. I think you could have more fun if you changed your mindset, but obviously that's up to you. It's pretty clear from my vantage point that you're stuck inside a belief that every spec should be fun for any player that wants to achieve performance that's respectable relative to the most optimal specs in the game. That just wasn't part of vanilla.
---
The _underlying_ realization I was hoping to provoke, which I can see you missed, is that everything is completely arbitrary and relative, subject to interpretation and value judgments. Moonkins, ret paladins, elemental shamans, they'll all be available in Classic. They'll all be able to join raid groups and zone in. In Vanilla not every spec _has_ to be ideal for raiding. No amount of throwing out straw men to distract people will change that. Speaking of which:
---
&gt; I think it's more that nobody cares about the special snowflakes who think they are expressing their unique artistic souls by picking the bad menu option off a list of three.
---
These specs aren't bad at _everything_. They have strengths outside of raids. Sorry you aren't interested enough in the rest of the game to appreciate that. I hope that the Classic team keeps all players in mind, and that includes all of us -- and not just you. See where I'm getting at? I think _you're_ the special snowflake pleading that Blizzard to change the game so that _you_ can pick any of those three spec choices and get a spec that fits _your_ definition of "good" for endgame PvE. Those of us who actually _like_ the unique challenges that vanilla presented, say, balance druids, don't matter to you, I guess.
---
I play on private servers but I didn't play the demo. I run a 2070 in vanilla but its total overkill. 
---
I assume you could but definitely on medium low settings. The 7850 is a 6 year old card.
---
You don't need to beg, there's no way they'll dedicate man hours to rebalance the classes before the game is even out. 
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I will definetly by mining allot more than usual and i think ill create a low lvl alt just for more copper and skinning. So i can get light leather while mining tons of copper. Good thing that im not in a rush to 60
---
I thought about doing that... Is there a way to reactivate my old account to play for free for a few days? :P
---
That won't work unfortunately. 1080p is blurry on 4K. Monitors apply blur when you upscale anything to native resolution.
---
Care to elaborate on some weird patchwerk tactics?
---
Shit dude you didn't hear?
---
Not worried at all, it’s a game.if it great I’ll play it,if not I’ll move on. But I’m really optimistic so far Since nothing I’m 100% against has been announced 
---
No thanks, tried it for a bit, didn’t rally like it. I’m more interested in classic.
---
This isn’t vanilla this is classic 
---
&gt; 1080p is blurry on 4K
---
Simply not true, 1080p on a 4k monitor looks exactly like it would on a 1080p monitor.
---
Quel isn't amazing, but MC basically lacks any strictly superior tanking weapons, and you can get Quel easily (buy the book, do Ony which is trivial for any guild that can fill the raid). 
---
BWL has several tanking weapon options, but besides a very slow mace, most will be desired as dps upgrades for rogues and fury warriors. The mace has good stats but low speed. 
---
Bloodlord's defender (ZG) is probably the best all-around tanking weapon before AQ40. Crulshurok, simply due to high dps (and having stam) is probably the other best alternative, although of course it is an excellent dps warrior weapon as well. Whether it should go to the main tank, or a dps warrior, depends on the state of the guild. Ally? DPS warriors are probably all humans wanting to use swords, so Crul for the tank is a higher priority- but thanks to salv, threat is much less of an issue. For horde, DPS warriors will mostly be orcs, and want Crul for that role, but at the same time tanks generate less effective threat so having a sufficient weapon for the main tank is more important. 
---
Our guild was far from asking for the maximum - we just required to keep up one main consumable (e.g. Elixir of Mongoose) and have some Mana pots. These people brought all the extra stuff, such as flasks, shadow oils, sharpening stones, dynamite, etc.
---
This isn't true, I'm sorry.
---
I've used a 4K monitor before and it simply isn't the case. :(
---
[http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/](http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/)
---
Not that retail needed any help with that at this point. Blizz are smart trying to merge the classic sub with the retail sub to save numbers.
---
Our group plans on running normal 5 man groups  Wednesday and  raiding Sunday Nights. We get done what we get done. No reason to rush to Naxx. 
---
Are you me? I feel like I spend half my time planning my future character. I'm so excited. My brother in laws are gonna hop in as well and they never played classic. It's gonna be a good damn time. I'm excited to be excited about maaaaybe leveling once in a night. 
---
&gt; classic can remain for those who want to enjoy it.
---
I mean, Vanilla got patched and changes was made. That was also a part of the Vanilla experience. There isn't *one* pure version of Vanilla everyone agrees on is the best and true experience. It was an evolving experience.
---
I went back to some old games. Been playing the remastered Bioshock games. 1st one was as excellent as I remember, 2nd one crashed and deleted my save file, thus losing me 3 hours of progress so fuck that.
---
Feel like I might go back to Fallout 3 and NV in the mean time.
---
Literally from that link
---
&gt; The solution
---
&gt; Each logical pixel could be displayed as a square group of integer (2×2, 3×3) number of physical pixels of the same color. Live demo.
---
That's the case when viewing 1080 on a 4k display each pixel is shown as 2x2 pixels.
---
Changing the game client to reduce GM tickets or lower server costs for a restoration project intended to keep the game available to play _forever_ is only similar to the ongoing changes introduced to retail by expansions in the sense that they are both changes to the same game. But there's nothing arbitrary about the distinction, you just didn't comprehend it.
---
- Expansions are deliberate, substantial changes to the game experience designed to maintain interest in the game over time, even after content gets dull for many of the players.
---
- Classic is a project designed to restore the original game _before_ those expansions for players who would rather re-play the original game until it is once again dull than return to the retail version.
---
Here's the thing: _vanilla_ was never designed to be running forever, even when hardly anybody is paying for it anymore. Whether they started with the 1.12 or 7.x client/server, they were _going_ to have to change certain things to make it viable for the long haul.
---
Fun side effect of faction locked paladins/shamans is that priests become the budget version of class their faction can’t play. 
---
So yes defensive dispel is huge, and horde priests also do the overwhelming majority of horde healing. They are cloth paladins. 
---
And in contrast, alliance priests are budget shamans. Purging a lot, and contributing damage, while ideally leaving almost all the healing to the paladins. 
---
I am more worried about spoiling my self on a private server and having to start building my character again when I move over to classic. It would feel terrible leaving my character behind.
---
That's the one that wasn't intended:)
---
lmao that's great, we never thought about kiting him THAT far. He could be slowed by frost trap so we tried kiting him around 3-4 traps, didn't go so well.
---
No, it isn't. Did you not the read the rest of the article where it says that no monitor does integer scaling?
---
You're describing integer scaling which is something that no monitor or GPU currently supports.
---
Care to show me a monitor that only uses a quarter of the screen when displaying 1080p?
---
Definitely one of the reason I'm excited for classic, I made a few friends back in the day but we all lost touch after awhile. I miss actually having to communicate with people. The game just seems so repetitive and tedious now, and with little to no interaction with other players whatsoever, because it's not needed anymore.  
---
I am a stoner, and will be playing horde on a PVP server, but I'm Pacific Time.
---
Vanilla wasn't that. I witnessed that. It wasn't. 
---
Pservers are apparently though. Don't mix everything.
---
2012 card on a 2004 game is also overkill.
---
Its like Legion but much worse. I would not recommend going back until at least 8.3 if at all. Classes have been pruned immensely with many passives being removed with no new ability at 120. The new gimmick is azerite armor which is netherlite crucible 2.0 but worse. Classes actually feel like you get weaker going from 110 to 120.
---
The AP grind is back but instead of unlocking new abilities/passives, you grind to replace the same traits you already had so your character does not progress much as tier sets are gone now as well.
---
New raid is pretty good, good boss fights. M+ is divisive on whether it is better or not, there are a lot more worse dungeons (tight corriders with tons of mobs) but some people like that. WQ are the exact same chores you did in legion but WQGF has been nerfed so they take longer.
---
Story is all over the place, its Horde vs Horde featuring the Alliance.
---
I have a lot of problems with retail and can't wait to get to classic.
---
Welp, you can always try your local Craigslist.
---
I think Classic is going to be great but I'm not going to be overly hyped, mainly for one reason.
---
You'll eventually finish Naxx. Then what?
---
Atleast with Live servers I guess there's a never-ending road in the future that has content. 
---
With Classic, you'll eventually do everything there is to do in the game. There are no achievements to go for, no transmog (if I believe correctly), only 7 raids, that yes, granted will be tough as nails which will add longevity. 
---
What is that makes you guys so excited? I just don't see it. 
---
I'm trying to run it at 4K 60, though.
---
I agree with you 100%
---
This thread has convinced me to unsub from /r/classicwow. So many vanilla elitists whining because someone dared to have fun playing their super srs bizness video game. If you don't like the ret pally then don't bring him. It's a fucking pug anyway. If you're getting your panties twisted because someone pugged as ret then why aren't you in a super srs big boy raiding guild?
---
Warrior DPS is a design flaw in the class itself, they just scale retardedly well due to how rage works. With bad gear they get less than ideal rage generation so they can't start to ramp up. But once they get better gear... weapon skill allows for less glancing which gives more rage, which in turn means more attacks can now crit, which gives more rage, which gives higher flurry uptime, which means more rage, their resource for special abilities generates faster the more dmg they do, allowing them to do even MORE dmg.
---
I don't think you need any kind of reactivation to test it - all your characters above lvl20 will be locked and that's it. 
---
Are you sure? Because 4k to 1080p seems like a perfect match (it's exactly 4 times smaller) and maybe there are some tricks in driver settings to set that?
---
LOL. Then why did it change in 2.0? Why can't you believe that such a complex game was not figured out by Blizzard back then from a balance point? Like why really?
---
The Vanilla balance was not intentional, otherwise there wouldn't have been patches from 1.1 to 1.12 in the first place, where TONS of changes happened. Open your eyes for god sake. 
---
Loot trading in raids is all I need to know about it. It wasn’t in vanilla and doesn’t belong. I do not trust Blizzard.
---
Ah, okay. I think I might try this. Thanks.
---
No, unfortunately anything that isn't native resolution that gets unscaled to native resolution gets blurred. No graphics drivers (either from AMD or Nvidia) have a solution to this problem even though the solution is very simple.
---
I was a blizzard fan for so long that this is no longer an issue for me. If you want something to lower your spirits, look up some videos about retail Wow.
---
You are really naive if you think Vanilla was a decided and complete game balance wise. Just look at the changelogs from beta to 1.12. And then check what they did for balance in TBC. And dare saying those balance changes were bad.
---
Exactly, one I first stepped into Azeroth, the world seemed endless and huge, there was no flying or mounts so everything took ages to get to. It truly felt like a world.
---
&gt; 2012 card on a 2004 game is also overkill.
---
2004 game forklifted onto a 2018 client.
---
Not to mention the 95% chance to end up on a dead server a month after the release. That's my main concern with classic, even sharding, as long as sharding is temporary ofcourse, otherwise it defeats   the point  
---
This is why I hate data-mining in retail and beta. It completely ruins the surprise of finding things in game and the community coming together to figure things out.
---
Its also difficult to avoid spoilers as they get posted everywhere.
---
If a new raid comes out, the bosses should remain a mystery till someone fights them. Makes the WF race more exciting that way as well.
---
I found Tormund!
---
A mage can 1v3 people if you know what you are doing. Goblin rocket helmet (the 30sec stun helm from engi) + sheep on another player. You have lots of time to kill the first person assuming it’s not a warlock and from then on it’s basically auto-pilot.
---
do you need to buy the latest expansion to play on classic servers? i only own up to cataclysm 
---
Like you said, there will be mature guilds in classic. 
---
I was only a kid during vanilla, but I still remember seeing a ton of recruiting from guilds based around being 18+ and understanding that the game comes second to the real world.
---
It really just boils down to taking the time to find the right guild that matches your commitment, or even start one.
---
It was in vanilla, it just took a GM to get it done. Player enabled loot trading frees up GMs for actual problems.
---
I am not stepping foot on a private server for privacy reasons, don’t want to ruin the experience again but if blizzard fucks this up, I’ll just end up on a good private servers that will come out if they fuck this up.  
---
Ah yeah I remember using that to get takk.
---
Few people actually did this. Now PUG runs of, say, UBRS will be cancerous because people will bring along friends to need on items for them.
---
It wasn’t in vanilla. It doesn’t belong. Stop carrying their water.
---
And GMs may not even exist. Blizzard is cutting down on customer support and with right click reporting, there’s a good chance.
---
Open your fucking eyes.
---
It was a treat to play!
---
However, I'm a pretty social player in games that allow me to communicate, and there hasn't been any really great social games this holiday season that let me do that, so I'm here watching Critical Role between my DnD sessions and work while waiting intently for Classic WoW to come out so I can be social in a game I give a damn about.
---
This.
---
Weapon skill has a relatively small effect on hit. Every point reduces the chance an enemy will dodge, parry, or be missed by 0.04%, so +5 weapon skill overall reduces all three by 0.2% each. It's the glancing blow damage reduction that is reduced by having higher weapon skill that really makes it a DPS and therefore TPS increase. And the more weapon skill you have the less useful it becomes for reducing glancing blow damage reduction, so a non-human gets more benefit from items like edgemaster's handguards and maladath than a human. But it's still great for a human.
---
Is this how well know if someone dies playing 72 hours straight 
---
gl trying to convince everyone to change the meta for you :p 
---
It's dodge, parry, crit for 0.04%. Chance to miss follows 10x more effect. This is why you miss so much when trying to level up weapon skill
---
I have a friend who jokes that all the wars in LOTR movies could've been easily won if the good guys had 10 Legolases. It's been so long since I've read the books, but IIRC they described him as nimble and being very good with bows, but that was it. 
---
Wrong sub, this is for Classic.
---
My first alliance toon in vanilla was a human paladin. I absolutely hated it. Got it to 60 at my own behest, leveling and playing was slow and boring. Auto attacks, bubble, heal, rinse repeat lol 
---
Did not enjoy. I definitely bubble hearthed on many occasions 
---
Dwarf and warlock?
---
Wait, you mean gnome!
---
First Blizzard title? ;)
---
Jesus man, get a grip. The ability to fix master loot mistakes without waiting days for a GM is that big of a deal? Maybe you need to step away from video games for a while? The "slippery slope", tin-foil-hat-paranoia is not flattering.
---
&gt;I ordered a 4K monitor mostly for coding 
---
this has to be a troll 
---
&gt; My response was absolutely pertinent to the OP. The OP asked for what changes could make specs more fun, and I suggested a change in mindset could make them more fun.
---
That is obviously not what they intended, so this is disingenuous.
---
&gt; I think you could have more fun, too, if you were open to changing your mindset, but obviously that's up to you.
---
Snowflakes always seem to think they are terribly special and unique for playing something bad, and anyone who is not terribly impressed with their "creativity" must be an intrinsically boring and closed-minded person.
---
There is a time and a place for everything. There are loads of single-player games and skill-based games where you can dress up however you like and take on whatever handicap you like and more power to you. If you want to win Dark Souls with a level one toon using only the starter weapon or do naked wheelies down the freeway in Saints Row then go for it, have fun.
---
A gear-based MMORPG where your contribution to a group matters a lot to other people's experiences and where what you are doing is simply mathematically bad seems like a weird place to try to express that kind of creativity. And a *deeply* weird place to get this deep sense of entitlement you obviously have that you are *owed* the ability to do this, and that this entitlement is much more important than the desires of people who want to play the same class and be useful in PvE.
---
&gt; The underlying realization I was hoping to provoke, which I can see you missed, is that everything is completely arbitrary and relative
---
It's amazing how often the various flavours of #nochanges posters end up circling down the drain of radical subjectivism, which they think is a profound realisation instead of a noob error.
---
But if everything is relative then there's no need for you to share your opinion, and no game design decision is better or worse than any other. So I think you are using radical subjectivism as a cover for a stupid opinion rather than sincerely believing what you are saying.
---
&gt; In Vanilla not every spec has to be ideal for raiding.
---
This is at best a half-truth. Raiding is the endgame. I didn't make it that way, Blizzard did that, but if you want to PvE or PvP competitively you need to raid. And in a raid a snowflake spec that is bad at its job is a straight downgrade to everyone else's experience so nobody really wants them there.
---
&gt; These specs aren't bad at everything. They have strengths outside of raids. Sorry you aren't interested enough in the rest of the game to appreciate that.
---
Read the OP again, genius. They were asking about PvE raid comps. That is the topic.
---
&gt; See where I'm getting at? I think you're the special snowflake pleading that Blizzard to change the game so that you can pick any of those three spec choices and get a spec that fits your definition of "good" for endgame PvE.
---
The thing is, I think it is 100% reasonable for people to want to be able to continue playing in endgame more or less the way they levelled if that is what they want to do. It's not some weird kind of entitlement for someone who levelled their paladin smashing evil with a big hammer to want to smash evil with a big hammer in Naxxramas. The fact that you *want* that option to suck a big pair of donkey balls just so you can feel like a special snowflake for picking it and sucking donkey balls is all well and good but it's insane to think that all the normal people who want to play their spec normally need to be bent over just so you can have this weird "fun" in a game fundamentally unsuited to it.
---
Seriously, would it really make your butt all that sore to have to find a different way to suck? If we took away your ability to suck at WoW by speccing ret or balance or whatever, would it really be that much of an imposition for you to have to find some other arbitrary way of making your toon shit at their endgame role? Play a warrior who refuses to use weapons, or a druid who refuses to wear pants, you know, use some *actual creativity*?
---
? This subredit is for Classic WoW
---
Many things adding up overtime. Biggest issue right now is how there's basically nothing to do outside of raiding, and raiding is barely satisfying because gearing is pretty screwed up with too much RNG, and people *not* raiding can get equally, if not *better* gear by doing catch-up stuff like Warfronts where they are pretty much reward free gear without doing anything.
---
Other issues like professions are completly dead and useless, being a staple in earlier WoW, and many people miss it.
---
The only content there is to do is doing older content for mounts and transmog.
---
Good story and all, but a Rogue cant Ambush you then Vanish &gt; Sap because you would be in combat, even if Vanish takes him out of it
---
&gt;i5 3570k/AMD Sapphire Radeon HD 7950/8GB RAM

I think I've got a fair comparison.
---
i5 4590 / Radeon HD7850 / 16GB Ram. ---- overall a reasonably similar setup to yours.

Just opened up Retail, loaded up a character in Ironforge (not subbed, so no real populous areas)
---
@ graphical setting 8 for 21:9 2560 x 1080, I get about 75-90 FPS. For out in the world, I needed to use graphical setting 6 / 7 to keep things steady at 60+
---
night elf druid, with that "purple" skin (one tone more "pink" than the most "blue" one)
---
White hair, even got his name already picked, though won't disclose it on reddit...
---
And my alt, human warlock, black skin, blonde hair, the style with 2 braids in front, and full beard.
---
Too decided? :Ð
---
Every class needs damaging abilities or else they wouldn't be able to kill mobs on their own.. you literally wouldn't be able to level without constantly grouping. 
---
What that doesn't translate into though in any shape or form is every class having roughly the same damage output in a raid environment. 
---
"oh. 10 quests to turn it, will hopefully get a level"
---
20 minutes later...
---
"come on, just the last turn in..."
---
It's all about preparation and safety!
---
“Warriors shouldn’t be the best at everything and ret paladins shouldn’t be memes” is not making classes the same. Shitty class balance is not a feature, it’s an issue. Toning down warrior damage will not make them feel like a reskin of another class. They are still the same class except they won’t beat pure dps classes on the charts.
---
Here's a simple argument you might be able to comprehend, sharding wasn't a feature of vanilla wow and therefor shouldn't be a feature of classic wow.  Nothing more needs to be discussed. J Allen Brack himself said in summary "we don't care how many people come or go or stay we just want it to be authentic."

???
---
It will be between June-Sept, I hope for a June/July release though, so I can no life during the summer holidays. 
---
Yeah bro. I quit at then end of Wrath. Life is suffering.
---
I feel the same but don't get fooled. Don't forget that most people who will play Classic don't post on this subreddit, neither read it. Most people have lives, and the same people won't be hardcore about this, simply because back then they weren't, and retail (if they play it) does not seem to get them used to be hardcore either.
---
It will totally be possible and common to find PuGs, friends to add on lists, and guilds that will have normal people in it. I believe so. And comments like yours, the other guy who replied to you, me and other few in this thread proves it.
---
2 hunters, a druid, a shaman, and a rogue run WC. Who gets all the gear?
---
Thanks, that helps a lot.\~
---
The only thing you'll have to suffer is eating my dust because rather than sitting around trying to change the game to my liking I just get. shit. done. 
---
If blizzard wants to change spawn rates that's cool because it was actually part of vanilla. Sharding was not and has no place any authentic recreation of vanilla wow. 
---
Okay and then they further "fixed" them in WOTL but if you want to play TBC or WOTL you need to look elsewhere because this isn't that. 
---
Question:
---
So I understand that guilds will most likely use some form of a point system such as DKPs to award loot to guildies, but when you gather up for a 40-man, there's a high chance that some people might not show up (shit happens), and if you can't fill in those spots with other guildies, then you pug, BUT... if you pug, what does that pug player gets? You can't tell the pug player "you can tag along as long as you don't roll on anything because this is for our guild" but you also can't have the pug's claim to loot be equal to your valuable guild mates who have done everything asked of them for a chance to get the loot. So... how do guilds determine the loot?
---
And follow up question - what if the pug is a memespec (like ret paladin) but you have 38 players and can't find anyone else? Even if the ret pally will do NOTHING but auto-attack the boss, that's still extra dps no matter how you look at it, so do you go ahead and take him in for the raid because every little bit helps? Or do you tell him to take a hike and run it 38-man? And if you DO take him in, doesn't he deserve SOME claim to the loot, even if a bad player?
---
Yes, always have to logout before 3 PM, when ganking starts.
---
July 8th
---
Yeah this has been every xpac as Warrior. Start out struggling to fill your GCDs and by the time the second raid rolls around you start to wow yourself.
---
Ubrelated but Ill never forget getting Draught of Souls on my first Guldan kill and pulling 12million DPS openers before the nerfs.
---
The talents are pretty locked in Vanilla for PvE. Even with such easy raids you will still need to show up with a cookie cutter build. Here imo retail does it better by having fewer talents, but more choice. The beauty of Vanilla talents are the PvP and especially wPvP builds you can make. Conflag/NF is extremely fun when running around ganking people in EPL, but it's very bad in raids. 
---
Speaking of talents, Blizzard should implement the 1.0 talents at launch to balance the game more. MC is so trivial, older talents might make it a bit more interesting.
---
I don't care about your damn meta that developed on your pserver or your top guild back then. I really don't care. My experience, and many others experience was different. That's all.
---
No people are toxic to people who are hyper hardcore like you. That's fine do your thing. But you are beginning to be dangerously toxic for people not like you, that still cleared most of the content back then, and that had fun, no problems with anyone. You should stop. Really.
---
What about Blackpowder Mountain, when you try to get your group inside BRD, and that MC raid will always have you?
---
Id keep playing if your enjoying it. Then switch over with us when classic comes. You will be fresh and remember all the quests and everything too.
---
You eventually finish every game you play. I mean, would you refrain from playing Red Dead 2 just because you know you will beat it one day? Would you refuse to play the upcoming FF7 remake just because you already played the original and will eventually finish it? Of course not, and those games youll beat in just 2 weeks.
---
Naxx comes out like 2 years after classic launch, lol.
---
Exactly, skipping quests or areas because it is too crowded and not worth the wait is a feature of vanilla. Competing for mos is a feature of vanilla. If you feel entitled to mobs and tags there is this thing called retail where everyone who participate in a kill gets the credit and you get your own little bubble to play in so you don't have to experience the big bad outside world. 
---
I feel like too many people base this on sexual identity/sexual preference.
---
This is irrelevant to any decision I make in WoW and if you're comfortable with yourself then toon gender should be chosen based on the asexual reasons I listed in my previous post.
---
Honestly? Never been there, until the WoD music rolls came. It will be my first time in vanilla!
---
Classic.
---
Stacking spell damage trinkets. I got them both right away, and I had a blast in battlegrounds.
---
I suppose in my head I meant why does BFA suck in the minds of people who are waiting for classic lol
