If it's such a low cost, then why don't you cover it for everybody and their alts?

Also so much for this argument of yours:
---
&gt; Nothing is out of your control. You are not forced to play on a specific server. If your current server has too low of a popuation for your tastes, you can easily create a character on a different server --- FOR FREE.

I had thought they "fixed" this in retail vanilla at some point though. Wondering if anyone knows when this was, maybe it was during BC then?
---
They changed it at one point where the tagger still got the loot, but the XP was still reduced when out of party members were involved in the fighting I thought.

I used DD in FFXI, you're in good company man, we get what you mean. 
---
Always sacrifice your succubus in raids.
---
Good, except trading it back to the master looter. The item is returned to the master loot interface, so that every person eligible for the item gets notified. 
---
If the new recipient is not in range, have it sent in the mail. 
---
If anyone eligible is logged off, send an in game mail explaining that an item they were eligible for, was sent back to the master loot interface, and assigned to a new player.
---
Enforced transparency being the key, so that the master looters 5 friends don't roll. Have it assigned to one of them, then traded back to the master looter, then sold off to someone.
---
Alternatively, no loot trading. A loot assignment is final is final is final.
---
It’s always easier to get into groups as a tank or healer, but unless that is the single most important factor for you, I would not recommend choosing your class based on it. Mages are the best overall DPS class imo and are always wanted in groups.
---
It's so much worse on private servers than it was in 2006. The amount of ganking in places like stv is one of the worst things about those 10k pop private servers. Questing there isn't even really an option if even remotely value your time. 
---
You guys are intense. I’ll likely take a week off work, but still play relatively casually. I’ll still go to bed at a normal hour and sleep as much as I want/need, haha.

and they were sub optimal without the pummelers as far as i understand. both threat and survivability-wise.
---
To compare how retail Classic was to this new Classic will be extremely difficult for many, as their memories of previous class and mechanics changes will mess it up.
---
!.12 patch only existed for a very brief moment in retail Classic's history. Video reference is likely the only reliable method.
---
Vanilla had no official guild bank, so the GM or an officer has to be the banker. Does this "feature" encourage guild members to be more trusting, or encourage corruption and back stabbing?
---
Really? Holy shit, that must've been really weird haha. I bet that barely ever happens! 
---
I live in EST and have always preferred to play in EST and Central. Ideally raid times within 8-11 range on east coast.

---
More than you might think in pvp. Warlocks with the right spec can have so many dots on an enemy slowly ticking away their health and also preventing first aid from working.
---
Inchanters turning your upgrades to shards... 
---
That'll go over great.
---
My take on what PVP server offers... 
---
After about 20 levels you're well used to how mobs act, how to pull them, what to do when you're in trouble... You feel pretty good, like you've found your legs as an adventurer. That's when you enter the contested zones for the first time, and halfway into killing a mob someone jumps you from outside your POV, ending your life easily. Nothing in your bag of tricks can save you when you're caught off guard like this. 
---
The contested zones (which is pretty much the world) feel way more dangerous and wild. You're not zoned out mindlessly clicking one mob after another, only paying attention to eat/drink/bandage. You're watching every direction, eyes on the horizon and crests of hills. You avoid the roads and high traffic areas when you can, unless the zone is known to be dominated by your faction. You monitor the local channels for hostile activity, and warn others of any you see. You're inclined to team up with locals of your faction and quest together, because having even one friend makes you no longer a viable target to 80% of enemy faction questing in your area. You learn to interact with the enemy faction, and always have this little moment of tension when you spot one (x10 if you roll up to a group with one of your own). Sometimes you can defuse it and even have some fun with the enemy, sometimes you brawl. Losing pushes you to learn the ins and outs of your class, and get the best gear you can for your level range. Winning feels fucking awesome. 
---
And even then, when you've mastered your PvP skills and decked yourself in some dungeon blues... a 60 riding through on his way can decide you're lunch and swat you as they pass. You're never safe out there, not 100%. 
---
Same.  44 here.
---
I don't want it but if it's in the game my friends and I will definitely abuse it. 
---
If you roll with a group of fucktards... this is classic.
---
Theres no looking for group.

Been training for this for 4 years as that’s how old my oldest kid is atm and I usually only get 5 hours of sleep a night as it is with normal day work lol.
---
Give us release date blizz!!
---
Why would you abuse this and not master looter to accomplish the same thing?
---
Also please give us your character names so we can avoid grouping with your toxic asses.
---
It's cute how you think fearmongering on reddit about things that will never happen in a computer game is fighting for a social issue.
---
I’m going to need to sort out gearing for my guild, but I sure as hell don’t want to go through DKP again. I think an educated loot council that funnels BiS gear correctly is the best path.
---
Regardless, to answer your question, I recall druids and hunters getting the most gear in Vanilla.
---
Neat solution. Rather have no loot trading at all but I like this compromise best. 
---
The guild vs pug difference is worth pointing out. But no, I've never heard anyone argue guild banks ruined the game for them.
---
Depends on how exactly they implement it. I think loot trading was generally a good addition, and the potential for abuse in it's retail version is pretty low. With server communities coming back, it should be pretty easy to give a loot abusing group a bad name. 
---
Ashenvale... The magical vibe... Never ending forrest... And music! /cry
---
Only a fraction of loot trading abuses will be visible to the party. Many will be done secretly and thus the community cannot ostracize the guilty people to have them blacklisted.
---
The vanilla community was great because the toxic members self selected out of it. Loot trading gives them cover to continue existing in the community. 
---
Literally nothing stopped people in Vanilla from having their mates roll need in dungeons and then contacting a GM to trade the won item to you. 
---
Whats the difference?
---
Who the hell wants to deal with the administrative hassle of that?
---
Almost every guild I can think of from my vanilla server had some kind of gbank drama. Anything from just unfounded accusations from someone who left, to straight highjacking the whole thing. 
---
Great choice.
---
Managed it on my hunter, you won't be disappointed!
---
I went turbo back when WoD released, and it was hype. Quested in beta to experience it casually, then rushed through it in release to be one of the first 100s. Did it in two days I think?
---
I'm gonna try and recreate that so I can try and get ahead of the pack and avoid the endless stream of people behind me--it's especially important as a warrior since I'm gonna be so damn slow.
---
Wow, I literally spent the last half hour reading that thread.
---
That's really cool. Pity it looks like nothing ever came of it, and it was probably just people playing with young people's imagination. When I was a kid I was CONVINCED that the rumors were true that Luigi was a playable character in Super Mario 64. In any case, if there are undiscovered quests I agree it'll be fascinating to see if they are found. 
---
This comic is painfully true. 
---
The only recourse you have is to insist on "Need before Greed" in all groups and drop group if they won't change it. That way the warrior doesn't get to roll. 
---
He or his friend needs to be the group leader for master looter abuse to work, any member can abuse loot trading. Also what is the percentage that will run 5 man dungeon pugs with master loot instead of group loot and who would join those runs... Think.

Past the 1st 2-3 days of nearly no sleep, a regular sleep schedule is proven to be more efficient over time.
---
The kiddies don't realize this, so let them.
---
Sure, but more importantly, it also sucks. Sitting in a computer chair for 19~ hours for multiple days in a row would be torture.
---
I'm going to sleep reasonable hours and continue to maintain a life outside of WoW.
---
The game rewarded you for your skill and effort as a player, but also just as much so for your social skills.  It was like real life, or how real life should be.
---
People would complain about not being able to find groups and thus not be able to get the loot they craved.  My answer to that was always, "This is a social game.  In order to succeed, you have to learn to be social."
---
It's not an issue when player #34652 you see that week is opposing you in the battleground.
---
It is an issue if the raid leader, who beat you the previous 10 weeks in a row for a world boss, shows up to lead his guild to victory the 11th week in a row.  
---
It is an issue if the battle ground leader, who you are not able to surpass in honor. Is well within schedule to lead his friends to the top 10 spots that week.
---
Both of these issues, faced by the players that certain key individuals oppose. Can be solved easily by right click reporting them, causing an automatic temporary ban. If you have been led by a particularly competent individual, you understand how devastating it can be to have this person be banned for even a few hours.
---
1. World boss spawn, wait 30 minutes. Ban key individuals through the automated system, then kill the boss. Ban tank mid combat for hilarity.
---
2. World boss spawn, immediately right click report every level 60 and level 1 characters in Azshara.
---
3. Opposing battleground premade is 50k honor ahead, ban their flag carrier, OR opposing faction premade is winning against your premade, ban them.
---
4. A hunter is taking your devilsaurs in Un'goro, have your guild report him.
---
5. Someone is grabbing black lotus? Report lol
---
6. Person about to get scarab lord title? Report lulz
---
I can probably come up with more if given some time
---
"the wrinkled raiders"
---
Why are you advocating for loot trading? The only "problem" it fixes is misclicks which are not a problem. The addition is like 95% negative 5% positive. 
---
Unless you are the ninja looter who is going to abuse it so you really want to keep it in game. Then I applaud you, 200iq to make threads like these.
---
Military too ha? Already got like 10 days set aside for it ha
---
I remember being a warlock and my pet wouldn't despawn until my other pet was fully summoned
---
Dammit now I want to know what the deal with Zalajshi was lol.
---
I'm similarly confused by the rest of the comments. I thought EXP required you to do a certain amount of damage or something to the mob--i.e. just tagging a mob and having some other guy not in your party kill it would give next to no EXP.
---
I thought this was vanilla but maybe it was TBC?

You can't have literally hundreds of hours of "reaction" videos on youtube, regardless of who posts them, without doing hundreds of hours of reaction video content.

“Hey we have 4/5 people needed for he party. Let’s look for someone to invite us all!” - said no group of friends ever.
---
Just because it's possible to ninja loot now, doesn't mean adding another means isn't an issue. That's like saying not wearing a seat belt is a more effective way of dying in a car accident, so taking out the air bags is a non-issue. This is introducing a new mechanic that can be abused, so it's still an issue. We don't yet know how it will be implemented and how players will adapt to it, so it might end up being a non-issue, but for now it's still very much concerning. 
---
Community is in my top 3 reasons for being worried about classic wow.
---
Gaming is a series of twitch chat emotes and elitism... Even in this subreddit and I don't expect it to be the once gloriousness wow was 
---
I’m not advocating for it, just saying it’s not a huge deal. It frees up gm resources to deal with botters and goldsellers which I think are far worse than someone using grouploot to ninja instead of using masterloot to ninja.
---
Pretty much what u/Wegwacc said. Rogues are a solid pick but not so much for a newb. Levelling will be slow and you'll die often.
---
Asking for loot trading to be removed is asking for changes. Vanilla had loot trading via GM tickets.
---
That's not how master looting works... 
---
Beats having to administer every single piece of loot like LC does surely? 
---
You might be able to hide it from someone with an iq lower than their character level maybe, but it’s going to be pretty obvious what’s going on to anyone of moderate intelligence who’s actually paying attention.
---
That's really cool. I hope it works out in classic.
---
Very true, I guess I took the 5-second rule with regards to channeling as a given. Just one more question that needs answering, but Classic is getting very close now!
---
Serious answer- killing mobs, especially skinnable mobs. Vendor skins up to heavy leather, AH higher skins or craft items with low mat requirements to disenchant. AH higher level enchanting mats. 
---
Just do that with your main class and a friend who has LW. 
---
I’m trying to be first on and save names like “hunter” and “paladin”
---
So because toxic people exist regardless, you dont think adding an entirely new mechanic to be abused will have any effect on net toxic behavior?
---
What is so hard to understand?
---
It mutes the person, they can't talk at all - to anyone. It's not the same as ignore, ignoring them only hides their messages for yourself and not for every player.
---
It only takes a couple of friends or guildies to ruin someone's experience for days until he gets unmuted by a ticket to gm.
---
Right click reporting wouldn't be a problem if the muting and temporary banning wasn't automated, but actually reviewed by a gm.
---
I’m taking off a week from work. Vacation plus days off gives me  11 days off in a row
---
My plan is 10-12 hours per day, everyday. Want to grind hard into the game. I’m going to try and have 2 level 60s by the time I go back to work
---
I loved that map
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOCRGSbM-QE
---
I dunno man, I wouldn't be so sure about the availability of porn in 20019.
---
Not in this case, no. This new mechanic accomplishes the exact same thing another existing mechanic does.
---
And, the existing mechanic is actually a more effective means of accomplishing the same thing: take a 5man where the group controls 4/5 party members. Even if they all need, it’s only an 80% chance to give the item to the person they’re trying to gear up.
---
Or... they could just master loot it to them.
---
Since these toxic people already exist, and a more effective method of ninja looting already exists, the addition of non-gm ticket loot trading wont have any significant effect on toxic behaviour 
---
Been on RP-PVP servers before, didn't find it any more mature than non-RP.
---
Eels up inside ya
---
Good ol‘ Athene, what is he doing nowadays?
---
Haha well if you're new to vanilla you're going to die no matter what. I think compared to paladins, hunters &amp; locks they're harder but I think their defensive cooldowns &amp; you really don't have to be particularly or bring much as a rogue come group content!
---
Apparently it has been around since 2009. Dunno how I never heard of it. Can anyone comment on how decent it is? I'm just itching to level up a toon in my spare time in preparation for official release of classic.
---
I think I get this reference.gif
---
Oh man. I was trying to be witty but your cute and positive response made me feel really bad. I'm sorry miados
---
&gt; If it's such a low cost, then why don't you cover it for everybody and their alts?
---
If by "you", you mean me... then of course it's because I don't give a shit about your wow characters. If by "you", you mean a general "you" like Blizzard, then they've already made that decision.
---
And how is that example relevant? There are hundreds of different scenarios and you named one of them. And again, in how many pug runs is master loot used? If you join a group where master loot is used it's your own fault if you get ninja'd on, you take that risk willingly. I would never do that unless I know the party leader.
---
If loot trading is in the game, you are **forced** to always take that risk when joining pugs, not just when master looting is used.
---
I'm gonna give you an example since you can't think of them yourself:
---
Group is 3/5 and is looking for 2 more. It doesn't matter if the 3 people that are already in are friends with each other or complete strangers. Duo of friends join - group is now full. Group loot is used, of course. Without loot trading the duo of friends can't both need on shit and trade it, with loot trading they double the chance of getting that rare drop that is worth getting kicked from the group. 
---
Your master loot argument doesn't matter at all.
---
It could be initially a 2/5 group of 2 friends and 3 randoms join in. The duo can abuse the loot trading if it's in game but no way to abuse otherwise. If they were using master loot the 3 randoms deserve to get ninja'd on.
---
Fantastic post, unrelated question. I’m trying to make a semi long top down picture like this with many different pictures... how do I do that lol
---
Depends how blizz handles fishing pools, on certain pservers they don't release it until later on since it wasn't available at launch.

[You sure you want to know?](https://youtu.be/-cKUEyoR-So)
---
It's really not going to be that many people in my mind. But I could be wrong. 
---
You’re absolutely right, but only if you ignore the fact that you can change the loot setting to master looter .0000001 seconds before the boss dies.
---
This risk has always existed, even if you didn’t realize it.
---
This is an excellent point. We'll see!
---
Holy fuck thats a clickbait hypothesis
---
Blind DKP heavily promotes background coordination. The warlocks for example creating private discords to coordinate what they're bidding and making sure they control how much they're spending on warlock-exclusive items. That way when an item drops that can be bid on by mages, they can use their heavy hitting DKP stack to ensure the win.  
---
A few hours fishing for 10g isn't terribly efficient, You can easily make that an hour grinding mobs in places like Swamp of Sorrows and vendoring everything 
---
Not in the military, Australian Primary school teacher. Need to organise my replacement sooner than later. 
---
More importantly and most likely quite a common issue: I need to explicitly warn/prep my partner haha for the madness that’ll be week 1/2 of Classic. 
---
I honestly don’t see how loot trading will change the amount of ninjas,if people want to ninja they will ninja.
---
Except life tab uses a global cooldown, so at some point the extra Shadowbolts that you'd be able to cast would accumulate.
---
I think it's pretty safe to assume the looting method used by the game will be the one that was enabled when the boss is pulled. If however you are right (I would appreciate proof) and the change mid combat applies, then I give that to you. Yes it could then be abused by the group leader. But not in the scenarios where neither of the friends is the leader.
---
If you're able to test out ret's DPS, then what stops you from testing out warrior or rogue's dps?  
---
That's the thing about memespecs. If you want to succeed, you have to do more work than everyone else.  
---
It has a lot of spells though and lots of things to learn. Leveling though is a breeze.
---
Can't grind in swamp of sorrows when the highest level on the server is level 15. This is a first week (or first few days) strategy; it's obviously not much good after that. Purely just for getting an early jump on owning the AH.
---
and it’s a blast!
---
I don't imagine that in any fight in the game it would be worth it either, but I'm wondering at what point it could. If you had X amount of mana, and the fight lasted Y, you could theoretically get so much extra mana without lifetapping that the lack of global cooldown would equate to &gt;15% increased damage. Has anyone ever done this math to see how far off fights are from this?
---
People on reddit in general think if you make a comment on something you're 100% on one side or the other. Do I want loot trading in the game? Not really. Is it a real problem that's going to change much of anything? Not really. Yet the legion of morons here will act like we're directly advocating for destroying their game with their ridiculous paranoia. 
---
It's amazing to me that THIS is the hot button issue around here too. Where is the outcry for spell batching? Why don't we have 60 threads a day about that? I assume it's because the community here has no idea what it is or what it means. I'm thankful for that too because authentic or not, spell batching sucks fat cocks. 
---
Per channel. The amount of missiles are strictly cosmetic.
---
Wands can crit but Shatter only increase the crit chance of your frost *spells.*
---
You could in fact do that, but I saw this happen a grand total of 2 times before this issue was addressed and fixed by Blizzard.  Again though you’re only taking that risk with the group leader, not all 4 other members of the party.
---
I don't think you're going to succeed in making the case that felhunter is better than succ, but regardless of that, you need to look at movement during each encounter.  
---
Movement is the best place to include instant cast abilities, in this case life tap.  
---
If you're standing still the entire fight, and life tap is going to cost a global, then you have to account for that time.  
---
If you're moving on some portions of the fight, and can use that time to life tap, it could mean increased efficiency.  
---
Guybrush's warlock spreadsheets have calculations for life taps. They might help you, but I can say this is going to be a journey of math for you.  
---
[deleted]
---
It's a complete waste of time trying to make poor gold per hour at level 15
---
The people trying to capitalize on the early game will be leveling fast and efficiently, Grinding mobs while leveling (Especially with Skinning) kills two birds with one stone, XP &amp; Gold.
---
Why should you have to run it again because someone was able to unfairly take the item you wanted?  Why are you willing to invonvenience everyone so that people can be shithead ninjas?
---
I dunno. You could even do a relatively lax LC — assign a piece to a class or multiple classes and let them /roll, especially once you’re a few clears in.
---
I’m not sure what I’ll end up rolling with.
---
A feature that was rarely used and often not worth the time spent. Oh yeah, and they also limited everyone to how many times a GM would resolve loot issues for an individual. So no, loot trading did not exist in Vanilla.
---
problem is i have only ever been a paladin!! i can play other classes but i don't no them as well 
---
Cool, thank you. Kind of tinkering around with the arcane tree to see how viable a single-target grind build would be focusing on mana efficiency. Kind of operating under the assumption AE grinding won't be viable pre-40 at launch due to population. I'm thinking either all the spots will be fought over or constant PvP won't make it viable. 
---
I'm planning to roll a paladin on release, been raiding since vanilla and would love to join you guys
---
Then you add them to your shitlist and move on, just like you’d do if they threw it on ML right before the boss died. 
---
Instances of people mislooting are way more common than a group of people willing to sacrifice their reputation on the server to get someone an item. Remember that community that is such an important part of vanilla?
---
You guys are completely blowing this out of proportion and it’s ridiculous. This is the stupidest possible hill to die on. 
---
Unfortunately, squeezing in shadow bolts  mostly won’t be an issue as Warlock’s will need to stop damage some times because of shadow bolt critical hits and threat. 
---
Later once your Main tank has a Thunderfury or the healers are geared enough to warrant 2h threat tanking. 
---
Alliance blessing of salvation/blessing of protection/threat totem/limited invulnerability potion -&gt; Warlocks will be able to ramp their output up. 
---
One of Warlocks main dps limiters is their lack of threat reduction hence why Ally Warlock have an easier time by always having 25% Salvation oppose to Horde sometimes having access to 20% threat totem. 
---
Ya it’s kind of bs but it’s Classic. Ally Warlocks in pvp really suffer from Will of the forsaken and Orc Warlock is op af (what I’m rolling) so it kind of balances out over all imo and isn’t an issue. 
---
Hope this helps 👍
---
you didn't make this video. even the youtube description says "video i had-didnt make"
---
You'll also have a very hard time finding groups for PvE content - lots of competition from other rogues, very dispensable, less valuable to groups than many other classes.
---
Rogues are fun for sure, particularly if you like to harass people in world PvP situations but I still don't think they're a great pick for a beginner.
---
It's hard to say. There's likely always going to be somewhere to grind but I don't know how viable Arcane is compared to Frost.
---
Depends on your class. Hunter/mate, grind, Druids quest. Faster travel, slower time to kill. 
---
In addition to what d2032 said (threat limits), many bosses have some movement necessary. And when you move, you might as well be casting life tap. So you're not actually wasting as many globals as one might expect
---
Originally DD was a type of *spell.* Direct damage vs damage over time. But language is plastic, I enjoy how things can change.
---
  
---
Your comment kinda makes me want to refer to classes as DPS, HPS, and TPS and feign confusion when other people wonder wtf is wrong with me. :)
---
If you don't like running the same dungeons repeatedly, you're really not going to have a good time in Classic.
---
You dodged my questions, are you going to answer why you're making excuses and inconveniencing the whole playerbase for ninja looters?  Are you a ninja looter or something?
---
Throw in CPS too, 100% uptime on sheep is a must. 
---
Fair enough, in my opinion they're in the middle. If you're a new player you're not as screwed as say a warrior or a druid. The learning curve is pretty rough but it's manageable &amp; I find that rogues tend to be consistent in all areas.
---
Group content though? Yeah fuck rogues I hate them in most expansions. Add nothing to a group &amp; tends to attract a lot of bad players. The type of raider who plays without a threat meter is always a rogue haha
---
I just finished watching tips out in depth warlock guide. This was a popular ask for his guest who is aliveTV? I think who was the warlock vanilla and caster expert. Short answer is life tap scales off shadow damage so you're doing more damage to yourself but gaining more mana back. So the mp5 gain from felhunter is baked into the 15% shadow damage increase and thus less taps cause you're gaining more mana. 
---
You seem really agitated. Go have a wank and come back with a clear mind. No one wants to talk to you when you need a Snickers, chief.
---
THIS. I’m so tired of people just ignoring this argument to continue their outrage. 
---
SHITTY PEOPLE WILL BE SHITTY NO MATTER WHAT
---
With loot trading at least we can fix misloots ourselves, which happens much more often than whatever worst case scenario you can come up with.
---
Pick pocket humanoids in dungeons
---
Just when you thought Duskwood couldn't get cooler.
---
I’d argue a complete distrust of the entire community is a huge problem for community building...
---
Ugh it's such a pita grind :p Great lorewise though \^\^
---
Anything to do with vanilla guild on daggerspine?
---
I don't plan on doing many quests at all...
---
But I might do The Legend of Stalvan around 30, cause it's a great tale.
---
This is one thing I'm afraid of. The tryhards from retail will being their mindset back to classic where everything has been theorycrafted for 14 years and will be dicks to people who want to do odd specs like you really could in Classic. 
---
If you ask me there is no reason to rush with Classic. It's already been beaten so why rush through it?
---
Hint: it involves a giant elite undead creature walking through Duskwood killing panicking newbies.
---
I agree with you Jimmy, though I don't see an obvious solution. The only insight we have is Ion's comments about sharding, which he commented saying  "We understand, and I understand **completely**, that sharding is antithetical to the concept of a cohesive Classic community." Though they are acutely aware of the issue, and also understand #NoChanges will deliver a very very poor launch experience at best.
---
The issues are competing with mob tags, respawn times of mobs, and respawn times of clickable quest items in the open world. 
---
I think sharding is their preference, as this can potentially preserve respawn timers of mobs and clickable quest items.  Though the negatives being the split player base.
---
If you wanted to preserve splitting the player base, I think they'd need to look at shared mob tagging/dynamic respawns, shared quest item drops, and faster respawns on clickable quest items in the world (or individual?).
---
Alternatively do nothing, and let us figure it out. As long as the servers don't crash and we can play, it'll simply be a crowded and frustrated 1-10 experience. 
---
Hah, let's see if you'll answer for a third time without answering the questin.
---
I'll do some testing later on the day if you like. No outside buffs/consumables, lvl 58 target, 5 min dps?
---
Legend of Stalvan was always one of my favourites, even though it's just a lot of walking basically.
---
Lol, only people living in fantasyland believe the first option. 
---
Honestly I think the mark of "hardcore" guilds in Classic *will* be clearing raids with unconventional specs. I mean, there is no world first stuff; that's been done already. 
---
So yeah, you'll get tryhards that will treat Classic as serious business as though they were competing for world first, but I suspect the majority of people won't care. 
---
Can't it be both?
---
There are outliers in every group, you'll find crappy people everywhere.
---
Loot trading *will* be abused, it's simply human nature to follow the path of least resistance and if it's easier to form groups with one or two guild mates so that you can all roll need on the best stuff to guarantee upgrades then they'll happily do it, why? Because everyone else does it.
---
Loot reserving is already an issue on private servers, but with loot trading there won't even be a need for reserving loot anymore since loot trading is so much more efficient.
---
It's a terrible system that will have terrible consequences on the long-term growth of Classic.
---
Good work yet again Frost, keeping making these videos, they're super nostalgic and interesting!
---
Why would your target be level 58?  
---
Make it 63 boss level. That's the only level people care about in min/maxing their gear.  
---
He mentions the word macro once, but focuses specifically on addons the whole time. I wonder if there is any further mention on macros else where. Perhaps they are tied together and changing one means changing the other though
---
Couldn't be abused, much less secretly abused. Also, I'm not asking for that. If everyone's paying $15-20 a month, it hardly seems like a giant expense to have someone help me out for five minutes once every year or two...
---
People won't learn to grow a pair.
---
I am unsure how it was either but i'll nod lightly for the moment.
---
I miss those. Do people still line up at stores when a new expansion comes out? Not that there are nearly as many game stores left as a decade ago.

He could still do on the side. Doubt he will, but he could if has the time &amp; energy.

I'll probably change my mind on my skin and hair colour at least 100 times before release.

This subreddit: The community building aspect was such an important part of Vanilla, your reputation actually mattered because you saw the same people all the time. 
---
Also this subreddit: HORDES OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO TO RIDICULOUS LENGTHS TO FUCK PEOPLE OVER TO THE POINT IT WILL RUIN THE GAME.
---
I understand this is reddit and people post shit all the time saying shit is theirs when its not, but I can assure you this was made by me and my buddy a long time ago when we were in highschool. The video was originally on Google Video back when, and it looks like someone still had it and uploaded it to youtube, which is awesome. On the video comments that is me saying that I made it. Match the names with the video and my youtube channel:

What the other guys said. And also whether the streamer likes it or not, they're going to have a personal defense force and any minor inconvenience towards the streamer might get you a ton of whispers and other forms of griefing from fan boys.
---
Honestly questing isn't going to be worth it day 1 and maybe even day two. If you want to. Get ahead I would recommend getting a leveling group of 3 people and immediately going to the hardest mobs in the starting zone ( so since I'm starting troll warrior, I'll be heading for the cave with thazzrils pick and staying until we know we can kill the level 5-6 scorpions north of the starting zone). Most people won't be there yet if I can get in within the first 5-10 minutes. If I can't, probably will just grind whatever I can find and do only the kill quests until I can get ahead
---
Do you know where I could look for such guides? I'd love to have a failsafe for my strategy of killing higher level mobs in a group. If I don't get in immediately I will probably need it lmao
---
No sleep until 60.
---
This still worked during BC, in the beginning at least, because that's how the first guy made it to level 70: https://www.videogamer.com/news/french-wow-player-reaches-level-70-in-28-hours

Çàîúš reporting for duty.

level 58 be fine just to get a fair idea, a boss be to difficult to do on your own and without buffs. cheers!
---
i'm pretty sure that, given the opportunity, ppl will be major assholes.
---
 it doesnt matter if you're young or old, vanilla vet or wrath kid, dev or player, cs or customer. it's in our nature to do this.
---
 
---
it's kinda the reason we have laws to begin with. 
---
For real. This guy is a fucking dick why are people upvoting him. "Hi" is not breaking the ice and leaving the dungeon is not a solution.
---
I have known my design for every Race/class combination in WoW for over 10 years. I never stray from them.  
---
This. The people complaining the loudest about the game not being social are the casuals who only do group finder bs. The game gets way more in depth with higher levels of content. If you try and do heroic or higher raiding or rated battlegrounds you are still forced to communicate and socialize. The only reason people think the social aspect is gona is because that's what they remember from playing as a kid, nostalgia is a helluva drug
---
Skinning + Leatherworking is excellent on a fresh server. A lot of people take skinning and vendor the skins for extra cash. When you take LW, you can do the same thing after you craft the items - the crafted items sell for what the skins would sell for + the other raw materials like thread/etc. You can essentially level up LW for free.
---
The trick is to only buy the recipes for the items that you're going to make. (i.e. Don't buy 20 recipes from the trainer just because you can. Only buy the 1 or 2 you will actually craft to level up.) This will let you keep your gear up to date as you level and make your life a lot easier.
---
After a server is a few months old, LW won't make any money. You will be able to sell the raw mats for the same price as the finished product because the market for Leatherworkers will be oversaturated. That's when you drop it and pick up another profession. Engineering is the most useful, while Herbalism will make the most money. 
---
Another poster mentioned getting 265 Enchanting at some point for a tanking trinket - also a great choice. You can drop this after you craft the trinket.
---
No one owes you an answer to a really stupid question.
---
make a warrior name it who and have a friend make a priest name where so you can say who's the tank and where's the healer.
---
Well, needless to say, you're not willing to put in the work.  
---
Good luck with ret.  
---
Please name your hunter Paladin and paladin Hunter.
---
It won’t be going to ridiculous lengths though.  Pretty easy to see from the OP just how easy it is to fuck somebody over in a “PUG” just by not recognizing any affiliation between certain members of the PUG. The very definition of a PUG doesn’t even work here since this is really a premade LF1
---
Edit I think a warrior does like 300-370 dps in full PRE BIS a mate of mine said.. so it's time to keep theory crafting!! 
---
But you're failing to understand that loot trading ENABLES another method to ninja gear that was not originally in the game.
---
Blizzards plan to fix the problem of ninja looting is to add a new, even more subtle way to ninja gear. Since you cant see 'player X trades item to player Y' like you would see if someone actually looted the item. 
---
It seems like people dont understand exactly what the problem is because they have no understanding of how the game works. If loot trading is enabled, youd better believe myself and any other semi serious to casual player will abuse this. Blizzards enabling a more toxic environment in their game that never existed before. It's a really stupid decision if you can simply understand how easy it is to abuse 
---
I'll be "Good Humor". Did I do it right? 
---
&gt;But you're failing to understand
---
No, I promise you I'm not. 
---
&gt;Blizzards plan to fix the problem of ninja looting
---
This isn't even what they're trying to do. 
---
&gt;It seems like people dont understand exactly what the problem is
---
pot kettle etc 
---
There is 0 benefit to adding loot trading to the game, yet adds a massively abusable mechanic to one of the most common processes of the game, rolling on loot.
---
&gt; All the online research won't be enough preparation.
---
We raided in vanilla w/o online research or even a quarter of the knowledge we have now and it was enough preparation. We're ahead just by default.
---
&gt; Some of your approach, expectations, and planning are clearly informed by false, or only partially true, or faction specific, information (some probably from this subreddit).
---
Please elaborate!
---
&gt; Plus you'll need a somewhat experienced officer team from the start if you don't want to base your success on pure random chance of the right people joining the guild and you promoting the right people.
---
I'am very good at spotting the right players for these positions and I know what kind of people I want to play with. Experience doesn't matter nearly as much as you might think or at all. I want to play/lead with people who are fun to be around because that is what counts in the end. They need to have good base mechanics, which is easy to spot, sometimes even if someone is just grinding mobs. And they need to be guild/community first type of people, which you can filter out by just listening to what they are mostly talking about, what they spend their time with, how they react to certain things. Learning boss mechanics, gearing and stuff like that is easily obtained, like we did before, so experience is really nothing I'am looking for.
---
What I'am lacking and researching right now isn't that, though. It is raid compositions because I don't remember even half of it and I'll be in charge of recruiting. The thing I'am most concerned with is avoiding drama. It usually stems from either gearing or discrepancies in player performance, which is why I came up with these weird restrictions I explained above. But through the discussion here and further thinking I see how they are ridiculous/impractical. But it was a nice thought experiment nontheless.
---
Thanks, this is a literal example of what my comment was pointing out. 
---
Been playing vanilla recently for the past 2 years straight. Never heard of any guild disbanding over the fucking bank. Maybe some shitter guild that doesn't even raid has 'drama' over someone taking ten mooncloth?
---
The only class that'd be a sucker to quest over grind is obviously the mage; for the rest questing either enhances the leveling rate or is a downright necessity (yes, questing was an afterthought in Vanilla, but it does not mean that it's slower for every class, otherwise Joanna's guides would've been much simpler for him to make).
---
I'd rather quest anyway though. Questing &amp; exploring is just much more fun. As if it matters if I'm lvl 60 only a few days later than the rest. In my experience it doesn't. What mattered the most in Vanilla and will matter in Classic is what you do after 60 throughout the rest of the game, because the majority of players will start the slack at some point and fall behind.
---
But Stream Sniping!
---
Go to bed Ian. 
---
Then keep it to tickets only. Making the feature available to every single player for every single boss is not the same thing as a GM reviewing a ticket. Stop making arguments in bad faith.
---
I can't say for sure but my guess would be it's because LB has a longer cast time, and you can start the cooldown on CL faster. I think the biggest burst you could do would be LB, NS LB, CL on a target that's at max range. The LBs would leave your hands at a similar time and land close to when CL finishes casting.
---
How do you see what other players trade between themselves?
---
Guesses:  
---
If it's a single target attack, you're adding ~100 damage for over double the mana cost by using chain lightning.  
---
It's possible the people you're watching have determined they can do a CL &gt; NS &gt; LB and still have a 'safe' amount of mana, but doing CL &gt; NS &gt; CL leaves them vulnerable on their mana game.  
---
Good question though, I have no idea.  
---
Central time here but Im with you. I work and have young children, the 6 or 7 pm PST would work best for me. (8 or 9 PM Central) Kids are in bed around 730 and wife around 830-9pm.
---
4 people that play together but actively don’t guild up just to keep their affiliation a secret so they can increase their chances of getting leveling items seems pretty ridiculous to me. Not to mention a warrior and rogue rolling on the staff would be ninjaing no matter what they did with it after. It would be easier to just put on ML before the boss dies and give it to who they want, then you have no chance of getting it. 
---
Seriously, you guys are completely blowing this out of proportion, coming up with increasingly complex ways in which people could abuse this, none of which really hold up. This is such a stupid hill to die on. 
---
Yeah, pretty sure people do it because of cast time. 
---
NS CL is definitely tighter burst, though. 
---
meta gold making
---
roll and blackmail basicly
---
Some of them do in some situations. But Chain lightning already has a shorter cast time and is like 2x-3x the mana. *usually* when it's time to use NS in the rotation the target is almost dead anyway.
---
They are tied together, what he is specifically referencing in the panel are changes made in burning crusade that prevented certain functions from being called both by add ons and the macro /script command that made writing automation macros trivial.
---
And just as a matter of practicality, we know they are using a much more modern fork of the client for classic wow, likely the final legion client 7.3.5 perhaps something even more modern when all is said and done, and while they're committed to removing add on and macro functionality that might interfere with the social aspects of classic, it's looking more like modern macros and add ons with things disabled than old macros, with things bolted on.
---
The shaman fire totem quest is call imo.
---
Not really unless you have a mage friend for an endless supply of conjured water. 
---
I love the days when Blizzard stopped Windfury proccing of itself... but only for same level windfury. So dual wielding shamns in 2.0 and forward put Windfury of a lower rank on the offhand and windfuried away like a makeshift helicopter.
---
Shatter increases the crit chance of all spells.
---
&gt;  If you make a mistake regarding loot, you simply live with that mistake, like all other mistakes in the game.
---
This is the answer. No loot trading, no exceptions. Even in a ML raid I think a two factor authorization is the pretty way to go. ML loots item to Player X instead Player Y. Player X get's a pop up that syas: 
---
RL is attempting to loot ITEM to you. Do you accept? This will bind the item to you. 
---
Are you seriously unable to see the difference between something that shows up in the fucking chat window and something you cant see at all because it's two players trading between themselves? You really think those are the same thing?
---
A tear for that poor healer  
---
quieting saying everything is fine
---
Wait, that video was Athene? 
---
You're the one downplaying the fact that nu-blizz is adding another, vastly more effective (because you'll remain anonymous) method to ninja loot. Not me.
---
In dreams is a really cool one, linkens quest is fucking massive, and if I stick to my endgame plan for shadow priest, creating benediction/anathema.
---
We live in a world fueled by greed and you are surprised by someone suggesting a strategy based on self interest?
---
That would take much more effort and time compared to the instantaneous loot trade. Also with no real guarantee of the GM to fulfill your request. Not a great comparison.
---
You asked for feedback. This is as real as it gets.
---
Damn. Seems like ancient history. If you wrote that in this sub, or the official (live) forums today you’d probably be banned or at least downvoted non stop.
---
The "original" vanilla community was full of greedy people as far as I remember. Some players only cared about personal loot.
---
Look up some monsters drop tables for appropriate level ranges. See which monsters drop vendor trash, grind endlessly for a few levels here and there = have a really solid amount of gold
---
Full pre bis is a bit higher I think for warr.
---
&gt;to trade it to the druid healer who wanted it for offspec
---
If you don't let healing druids roll on dps or tanking gear they'll stop healing for you and you'll take even longer to find a group. 
---
but paladins could save themself
---
hearthing out
---
I still have my WoW Classic and TBC Collectors Editions, but if we ever get up to WotLK servers I'd happily buy that one to remedy one of the great mistakes I've made in my life.
---
I settled for the standard edition of WotLK so I could go home and play immediately instead of having to wait till the morning and go to a bunch of stores looking for a CE.
---
So much regret.
---
Loot trading via GM tickets isn't what's being discussed tho soooo
---
Also a vastly more effective way to handle legitimate issues.
---
Why is it so hard for you to believe that people would abuse this loot trading? Its like you don't get that you would most likely wouldn't be able to tell they were doing it. When you add a way for people to do it without others knowing of course more people will do it. 
---
Does my HR writing paychecks encourage them to write my checks to their account? 
---
But loot reserving is transparent. You know from the start if a group or player wants to reserve a drop or not and are free to join or leave.
---
Why exactly do you NEED loot trading in the game? For the sake of all the GMs who just got laid off? Looting in the game is fine as is. You dont even need GMs. 
---
LET PEOPLE MISTLOOT BINDINGS FFS IT WOULD BE GREAT
---
Nothing you said is a counter argument. Writing a ticket takes ten seconds. GMs -had- to trade the item back in Vanilla, which is why the automatic system was introduced *to begin with.*
---
And hilarious that putting together a four-man party of guildies to ninja loot from a PuG is no effort compared to writing a GM ticket to you. Lol. 
---
ill do arround 1.2k dps in full prebis on bosses like lucy. 370 is a bit low even for single target. i would say more like 500-700 dps
---
the only way i can see loot trading to be a good sign is for you to only be able to do it while still in the same group and for it to come up with a vote saying something like "Person X wants to Trade[Item name] With Person Y" and if everyone says Yes then its traded this stops the ninja problem but weather or not they can implement this is a bigger question 
---
And joining a group with 2-3 guild members will be transparently obvious that there will be loot trading going on.
---
Or even 6 runs of wc trying to get the footpads. 
---
Game design is what shapes community interactions.
---
This is why we don't want LFR/LFD, flying, lack of elite quests and so on.
---
Loot trading would be a poor design for shaping community interactions, mostly driven by Blizzard's desire to reduce GM costs.
---
Yes they could master loot it to their friend BUT YOU WOULD SEE THAT. You cant tell if someone needs an item they could use to just give it to someone else. The whole problem with it is the second sentence. If you give means to ninja without repercussion then people will do so.
---
The forging of Quel’Serrar.
---
Everybody has their own preferences, but I don't even think the game is worth playing if you're not on a pvp server.  It's an entirely different experience.  It's especially different while leveling, but I can't even imagine blackrock mountain without pvp.
---
Being on a pvp server will definitely slow you down.  Sometimes your group/raid will be delayed \*severely\* by opposing groups/raids, you'll get camped while questing, an enemy will swing by and doink you with a fireblast at 5% hp, 17 rogues will all ambush you at the same time 10 minutes from the graveyard.  That all sucks a little bit, but then you get to fight back, get revenge, or survive a 3v1 gank because they suck and you're fuckin' dope.
---
Stuff like that makes the game much more interesting and alive imo.  If you enjoy pvp and aren't playing on a pvp server then you're missing half the game.  I enjoy battlegrounds, but they don't really compare to a long session of world pvp.  You'll learn the names of the guilds and players who participate in murdering you over the course of a year, and murdering them back is some satisfying shit.
---
Being camped for an hour is so much less infuriating to me than watching some opposing faction fucker mine my god damn rich thorium vein with no recourse because he's a baby bitch who chose not to be pvp flagged.
---
All that said, there's nothing wrong with not enjoying pvp, but you're not really engaged in everything the game has to offer (pvp-wise) if you're on a PvE server.
---
*I really like apples, but my friends tell me to eat oranges....what do you guys think?*
---
Holy shit.
---
Lol how did you not notice the dwarf walking in at the end of your own video and casting fear ward, right as you are talking about fear ward?
---
I was a Shammy in Vanilla and almost always did it opposite. I guess I always did it so LB and CL would land pretty dang close together.
---
The entire point is that you literally cannot see what other people trade between each other. It doesn't exist for you in your game. You can make accusations of 'oh these guys are in the same guild they must be colluding' but you cannot prove it with certainty. You clearly do not understand how enabling that fact is. People can accuse each other of it all day and will never be able to prove it. That's the difference. 
---
I can roll need on an item I plan to trade/sell and no one will actually be able to confirm my motivations. That makes it so much easier than what exists now. People cant screenshot text of you looting the item
---
A lot of these arguments (not saying you directly because I understand now that on reddit everyone is incredibly sensitive) seem like the come from people who actually dont even play the game. They are so used to retail, that insane level of anonymity is ingrained in them, that they dont actually understand how vanilla works.
---
Wait, holy shit, for real? Even in 1.12? If that's true I'm rolling shaman.
---
...because it's infinitely easier for Blizzard to do it this way. It's easier for them to implement. There are no moving parts. There's nothing for Blizzard to do. They can let the players sort it out among themselves, which is the kind of laissez faire attitude that Blizzard is using to design a lot of their systems. They don't want to deal with people filling out tickets to trade the sword of doom to the rogue because someone messed up. 
---
That costs them money. This solution doesn't. They're not going to spend money to make a system less efficient for them to run. Just think for two seconds about every business anywhere and ask if they would. Hell, ring your boss at home and ask them if your business would remain in business if you spent money knowingly making your enterprise less efficient.
---
Or need rolling instantly and permantly soulbinds any item. 
---
And enable loot trading only for bops that are won with a greed roll. 
---
Why wouldn't deadmines be available at release?
---
Are there any yellow humans in vanilla?
---
ye but it doesn't include any buffs at all other than battle shout
---
We used it all the time. You'd be surprised how many mistakes were made and how many people changed their minds after they had gotten the loot.
---
It doesn't have to be a four man party to be abused. Yourself and I could be in a group and we effectively have two rolls for each other. Either way, I'm a bit out of the loop on why people are arguing it's needed in the first place. I only recall in vanilla GM's really getting involved on raid level drops that a raid leader mistakenly gave to the wrong person. I could be wrong. Either way, I think everyone is getting a little too caught up in the debate, admittedly, myself included. 
---
Or child 
---
it truly is. while 1 level is pretty marginal, there are some tough spots to weave through in stealth!
---
Yes on the Asian servers 
---
You know there is another solution that I saw heavily implemented back in the day. I often saw people that had been ninja looted previously, just refuse to be anything except party lead. 
---
So it’s simple, make your own parties if your paranoid. That is 100% fail proof.
---
The 2005 vanilla community was amazing. The current private server community isn't. It's filled with selfish and toxic players.
---
Now Classic might become so popular that it'll bring enough retail players and old vanilla players back so that the private server community won't have that much of a negative effect, but we just don't know.
---
Yeah, totally agreeable. Yet, I know I wouldn't have the patience for this.
---
totally forgot about this thing
---
brb having flashbacks about the boat quest in arathi
---
Not EVERYONE will ninja shit, but the potential for abuse is still there.
---
If you don't want to chase random youtube links etc: Here's the short version:  
---
He fell for his own hype, tried to create a movement outside gaming and created a little cult compound to live in with his closest friends/followers.  
---
Also, he set up a crypto currency scam that was bound to fail. And it failed for everyone that wasn't Athene who probably made of with a bit of monies from his last non-believers.
---
You realized this is exactly why they forced personal loot on people in modern WoW right? If people could just stop being selfish loot driven pricks things like this would never be an issue.

It all depends on the situation. You could use NS with either. Shaman spells have short cast times and the Global Cooldown is always 1.5 seconds, so NS doesn't really add much to your burst damage. You use NS to avoid interrupts. It's easier to cast a Chain Lightning with someone in your face than a Lightning Bolt, so that could be why you notice people using NS on LB more often.
---
In general though, you want to Lightning Bolt into Chain Lightning because LB has a travel time but CL does not. That means they hit at the same time if you cast LB first. If you LB -&gt; NS -&gt; Chain Lightning, then the Chain Lightning could hit a second or so before the LB and give your target a chance to catch a heal.
---
I think when you have taken the time to get the group and travel to the dungeon there’s more patience to be had naturally. You’ve invested the time to get there so investing a little more to calmly coach someone is worth it. Plus you might end up with a new(bie) friend.
---
Compare that to my friend and I trying retail out last week and the tank saying he refused to tank anything after a mage accidentally pulled a couple of minutes in. Literally couldn’t believe it.
---
I honestly feel bad for the people that grind to 60. That's mindless as fuck no matter what class you pick. 
---
Twink items and enchanting materials are pretty much what I want to buy en masse whilst they are cheap and is the main reason for this post lol 
---
&gt;2 hour BoP loot trading is the same thing as GM ticket loot trading
---
....Not sure if trolling or seriously this dense.
---
Okay, I guess I need to clarify to everyone. I raided plenty with a Warlock all through Vanilla and BC (I got the game for Christmas, so like a month after it came out). I used the word "theoretically" in my post on purpose. I realize that you move in raids and that threat can be an issue etc, etc. I'm curious about this from a purely theoretical standpoint and wondering if anyone had ever crunched the numbers.
---
Yes I would actually, Master looter is a lot harder to mess up than people keep suggesting. 
---
Im almost positive people were just lying and hoping someone wouldn’t put in a ticket over it. Saw that happen a lot, got to remember most of us were a lot more gullible 15 years ago as children.
---
As far as people changing their minds, I do not remember this being a reason for having loot changed. The general consensus was, “Oh well, stuck with my decision now.” As it should be.
---
What do you mean people can’t screenshot text of you looting the item? Am I misunderstanding what you’re saying or did you forget that this is absolutely a thing that exists in the game, while accusing other people of having never played Vanilla? 
---
On my pserver, with a population higher than Classic is likely to be I see the same people and same guilds all the time. From my perspective people that argue loot trading will ruin the game seem to be the ones that have insane levels of anonymity ingrained in them. 
---
In late game dungeons items get reserved all the time, which requires them to put on ML for that boss. More than once items have been given to the wrong person, weather by accident or on purpose is impossible to tell. It’s not like a level of uncertainty in ninjaing will be something new for the community to deal with. 
---
Questing is faster for pretty much every class except Hunter. Mage can kill quickly but they have lots of downtime drinking; Hunter has almost 0 downtime outside of using a bandage or casting Mend Pet every so often.
---
AoE grinding on a mage is tricky because there's almost always going to be other mages trying to do the same thing.
---

There's a small chance that I'm going to change the facial hair, but I'm 95% sure that this is going to be the final look.
---
Compared to the gorge I have to agree. Burning steppes was a letdown. I think badlands is worse though 
---
Warriors are pretty fast if you know what you’re doing, though I agree on paladin. My first 60 in vanilla was a paladin. Rogues are pretty fast as well once you get the ability to hit an addition mob. 
---
Did he say any of them disbanded over it?
---
&gt; Unfortunately, squeezing in shadow bolts mostly won’t be an issue as Warlock’s will need to stop damage some times because of shadow bolt critical hits and threat. 
---
Even when specced MD/Ruin for threat reduction?
---
What's stupid about it?
---
"If only criminals would stop doing crimes, the world would be a better place."
---
At some point they adjusted the amount of +damage you could get from wands. Prior to that I think at level 60 green wands dropped with +20 specific damage. After they adjusted it I think green wands only had somewhere around 10-13.

I believe paladins could stack certain judgements in a similar way with downranking for a while but I could be wrong 
---
Do you have a build for a shaman leveling with a warrior?  I don't know how to build a shaman spec.
---
"Patience" came naturally through the ordeal of party play in Classic. Spamming LFM, Riding all the way to the dungeon... It's more productive to teach a bad palyer how to play than to kick them and doom the run 90% of the time.
---
I'am personaly a huge fan of grinding over questing and I leveled multiple toons with different grinding speeds.
---
Efficient, planned questing with some grinding sprinkled into it is the fastest way to level in terms of /played. Speed levelers have show that. Also Questing has the advantage of gaining more reputation.
---
Pure grinding is slightly slower, but as soon as you take some of the most efficient quests in between it becomes nearly as fast as the above. But it has the advantage of generating more gold. It is also most of the time safer than questing because you choose spots that fit your powerlevel better than a questing guide.
---
But both of those methods lack one thing that is highly important to me: Professions. People undervalue leveling professions because they try to take the first approach, with efficient questing and think they can do the professions "on the side" which just doesn't really work so they tend to level inefficiently. This is the reason many suggest that you should first speedlevel with efficient questing and then do the professions after hitting 60.
---
I personally favor the profession based grinding approach with a few convenient quests mixed in. The idea is to plan profession related routes ahead. Many professions can easily be kept at a high skill level so they actually become useful if you plan your own routes.
---
Primary profession can have a noticeable impact on grinding/leveling speed. Cooking not only saves you money but also *generates* money as the cooked foods often vendor for more than three times as much than the raw ingredients for very little time invested. I don't think I need to explain the value of fishing. Again something that is very easy to level up if done regularly and not in hindsight.
---
So far I'am very pleased with the results, because it seems to be a very efficient way to level to 60. And most importantly it is much more fun because I'am not mindlessly directed by quests but I'am freely exploring areas, researching materials, spawn rates etc. I'am taking notes, adapt my routes in a flexible and efficient way. My bags are not cluttered with quest items but are filled with nice stacks of materials and gold. I'am no longer a quest slave!
---
&gt; As far as people changing their minds, I do not remember this being a reason for having loot changed. The general consensus was, “Oh well, stuck with my decision now.” As it should be.
---
It happened all the time in my guild. People realized that the DKP prize for a certain item was too high and wanted to give it to someone else willing to pay the price.
---
Totally true. Also if they were truly awful you just made sure to remember the name and accidentally miss their whispers asking for an invite.
---
I can still remember the name of a terrible Druid on my server from 2005
---
Nice to see another fellow warlock tank. If you ever want to tank raids, let me know!
---
Exactly, which is why we have law enforcement. Loot trading, personal loot and every system like that is something we brought upon ourselves for simply not being able to behave and act like decent human beings. I'd rather we didn't have to have systems like that but I don't expect players to change any time soon so I don't expect the systems to go away either.
---
It could happen even if they are all the same level, and they know each other, it doesn't have to be the boosting scenario. Such thing could happen way more often, that's why it is even more concerning and important.
---
I never had such experiences
---
And you can get an 18 slot from AD rep. 
---
Yeah none of the guilds I was ever in did this. Once you had an item, its yours and the appropriate dkp deducted.  I can not imagine this what you actually told the GM’s either, I feel like “Misloot” was always the reason you gave them right?
---
It depends on the situation. If you're not sure whether you have time to kill someone with a Chain Lightning -&gt; Lightning Bolt -&gt; Shock combo, you do Lightning Bolt -&gt; NS Chain Lightning -&gt; Shock to hit them with everything at once.
---
Otherwise you do NS Lightning bolt because it has the longer cast time.
---
Tauren druid says hi. Moonfire spam to  tag mobs plus everyone else will be orc and undead. 
---
They do before 20. Once they get cat form it speeds up though. 
---
What's a good build for an enhancement shaman built for leveling with an arms warrior?
---
I believe arcane  missles and wand are more efficient in the early game for mage as far as level speed goes.  Frost only takes over around lvl 21 or 22 when you can start to aoe grind.
---
This kinda sounds like you want a new expansion in vanilla-theme. 
---
I dont agree or disagree with your post, but I highly doubt this will be a thing. Also, sounds like a new MMO project which Blizz have stated before - They do not want to work on 2 MMO games. 
---
Let’s say I’m a rogue and my buddy is a warrior and we running a dungeon, loot trading would mean that instead of having a 1/5 roll on the gear pieces we want we now have 2/5. It encourages shitty behavior. 
---
I would spec MD/Ruin if everyone is fresh 60 farming dungeons and the tanks are wearing greens. Forget raiding with it.
---
Yeah I didn't find much value in the book. It was hard to take seriously, that's why it's become a meme between my friends haha.
---
It has two spells it will be using as a core. Curse of the elements and shadowbolt. Once you have a friendly priest you can use spirit tap. That is core warlock dungeoning and raiding.
---
Rick and Bobby are out in the fields slaying gnolls. Bobby is level 60 and Rick is level 13.
---
Rick attacks a nearby mob which makes it 'his'. This is what is called a 'tag'. Bobby then runs up and one shots the mob for Rick, who is attributed with 100% of the exp as though he solo killed the mob.
---
This is what is known as mob tagging.
---
Did it stack with the talent that reduces your likeliness to be detected? 
---
But don't you like being the underdog?
---
His IQ is 61, he has a way.
---
So what about the offtanks? Good luck keeping them happy if Johnny who plays Ret once a month because 'respec costs are too high' and he's forced to heal in raids, takes an item that they need.
---
Nice meme.
---
Locks mate, stack spirit, vw tank one, fear other, repeat, use life tap when necessary between mobs and maybe use a bandage if your spirit isn't high enough to regen mana between fights. 
---
Sup?
---
Yeah that will certainly help, though every other druid is obviously Tauren too. Therefore you competing against everyone else with moonfire spam. It's certainly a leg up on most other classes though. 
---
I guess you're completely ignorant of the fact that it is game mechanics that shape player behavior, not the other way around?
---
Why do you think players will socialize and make friends *at all* in Classic WoW when people don't even talk to each other in Retail?
---
**Because the Vanilla game systems are fostered to necessitate cooperation and socialization.**
---
This is why game mechanics are so important. If there is a game mechanic that fosters collusion of friends against randoms, then it will happen.
---
Wtf is wrong with you 
---
Way to miss the point.
---
/hi and tossing a buff on them will be my go-to.
---
Yes, when it's natural. One guy having tons of people orbiting him at all times, regurgitating shitty memes and Twitch "culture" isn't similar to one faction having 10-20% more players.
---
I searched a lot and I don't, unfortunately. It was on the official, old school WoW website.
---
It was very near and dear to me because I really wanted an interracial mount, and eventually when the cloth turn-ins came out I dedicated all my resources to getting one, and I was the absolute first on my server's faction to get one.
---
I tried my best googling but it just seems buried in time. Maybe if someone used wayback machine to look through every page of the old WoW website...
---
I want to say Redridge but I'm playing horde this time due to friends :( 
---
So fucking accurate.
---
I do like some features wich are not RP but some are very exagerated...
---
Why not raid with it if you're threat capped, as u/d2032 said, you are up until "the tank gets TF or healers can handle warrior 2H threat tanking"?
---
I'm personally attacked
---
 Assuming you’re playing 12 hrs a day for 11 days that adds up to 5.5 days /played , I’d be surprised if you could get 1 toon to 60 :p
---
Private server? Those numbers are completely off btw
---
When the game makes it easier to conspire with friends in order to stack the odds of winning a particular item in their favor, the probability of you winning the items is lowered. Can we agree on that?
---
This creates an atmosphere of distrust where players expect others to conspire against them, so they will conspire against others as well. It degrades the community and turns it more toxic. This should be an acceptable change to the game.
---
I think this is the biggest one for me, having to actually do half this dungeon isn't authentic! 
---
The first goddamn Affliction talent tier has a +hit talent you mongoloid.
---
I would just like to add: I was in a hardcore raiding guild in classic.  We never finished Naxx, but we were working on the 4 horsemen.  We raided literally 8 hours a day every weekday, and weekends were reserved for farming runs.  Thousands of hours raiding before BC came out.  In all the time we raided, I can only recall 2 singular accounts where someone misclicked and needed to make a ticket for a piece of loot.  
---
If those 2 pieces of loot went to waste for the sake of fairness for millions of other players, I'd say fair enough. 
---
Don't add loot trading in game... just make a policy stating that loot issues will not be dealt with by GMs. 
---
61 IQ Vision: When a group of people are suddenly rolling need on stuff they clearly don't need but their friend does, they're probably trying to ninja it to trade to them.
---
Unless you're suggesting that people are going to bother keeping around sets of terribad gear to gimp their performance in dungeons to appear that they actually need this loot to trade it to their friend... rather than running the instance in their good gear on a reserve run to just give it to the friend.
---
Seriously. You probably don't even need 61 IQ to see the first situation happen, or to realize how inefficient the second would be.
---
I hate it when authors start their sentences with "Indeed". Reads like they're agreeing with their own words for me.
---
I preferred leveling as Elemental. Spell damage gear is non-existent until the 40s/50s, but there is plenty of intellect gear for you every step of the way. You save a lot of bag space because you won't have to carry 2 separate sets of gear for healing and damage.
---
Just don't try to play like an Elemental Shaman at low levels. You're not a caster until you get that 1 second cast time reduction on your lightning spells. You're a melee with shocks and totems.
---
Sup!
---
Sup bro!
---
[removed]
---
That's not how it functioned in classic. Sounds like you're asking for a change. What happened to #NOCHANGES!?
---
Vanilla did not have BoP loot trading. It had whiney little kids that GMs wanted to make shut up, and the GMs were not and are not part of the gameplay. 
---
Isn't it sad I forgot how nice it is when someone walk by and PW:F's you, among other buffs? Just shows how long it's been since world interactions felt relevant! This is gonna be gudddd... :) 
---
(OP I like your idea, I might try it. It'll be very minor rejections and plenty of people will perhaps become friends. Thanks for posting!)
---
All spell based procs are on a per-cast basis unless something specifically states otherwise.  
---
From the Arcane Concentration tooltip:
---
&gt;Gives you a 10% chance of entering a Clearcasting state after any damage spell hits a target.
---
The wording is confusing because the it's slightly ambiguous when it comes to defining a spell hit. Spell hits are binary in World of Warcraft and can only hit or miss. Spell hits and misses are calculated at the start of a cast and Arcane Missiles follows the same rules as every other spell. It checks whether it's a hit or miss at the start of the cast, then continues channeling until it's interrupted or the cast is completed.
---
It seems a little bit inconsistent, but it worked that way because Blizzard deemed it too powerful to get multiple chances at proccing Clearcasting for a single spell cast.
---
And if you claim that you're a hot chick IRL, your /d.... per hour will go through the roof.
---
Post it to r/prequelmemes for free karma.
---
this guys videos on professions are awesome too, i recommend em 
---
Groups of players spam for additional players to join them, meaning that the group leader would be among the conspirators either way.
---
All games are really anti social now. You don’t get anyone in game chat anymore in FPS games and I can hardly find anybody to talk to in MMOS anymore. ToonTown was so much more friendly :(
---
This needs to be an in-game event.
---
Very true. 
---
I'd also like to hear your answet when someone criticizes your flawed argument.
---
Guess I'm going against his claim and saying that threat cap is a massive exaggeration then aren't I?
---
Grats at 2/5 chance at your item when you could have a 5/5 chance of getting it with master loot.
---
Do you even ninja, bro?
---
lol yup.  Much better eating an overpower every few seconds of MS etc.
---
Doable with master looter either way.
---
I remember a couple of guys pulling a level 30(?) elite from duskwood to westfall, just to watch it rampage and lay waste to everyone in the zone. 
---
I also remember having to fly one path at a time. 
---
Blizzard... clearcast. Blizzard... clearcast...  would be OP as shit, lol.
---
playing on a normal server is playing a lesser version of the game 
---
"fun" is subjective.  You don't even need a shield to tank most dungeons until Sunken Temple.  
---
I don't find it more fun missing 50% of my attacks and taking significantly more damage for no reason.
---
Easy mode - alliance
---
somewhat harder mode - horde
---
Exactly. Some private servers erroneously (MaNGOS core mainly) allow Clearcasting to proc per tick, not per cast and it's hilariously overpowered. With sufficient targets Mages have infinite sustain.
---
even with only battleshout ( and why would you only count  battleshout) its still higher then 300 dps
---
and why exactly are "private server numbers completly off" ?
---
armor values have been calculated from old videos and are known. most private servers even overbuff bosses with 1k more armor then bosses should have.
---
Literally the only one that can cheat you in the master loot system is the group leader. The only thing that changes if people in the group are his friends/guildies is they wont blast the person’s name along with you. Again, this was VERY rare across the board.
---
If you’re really this paranoid make your own groups then. So unless you’re the problem, you wont have any issues with ninja looters.
---
What?! Fuck that quest. All those Grintotem quests can suck a nut. I hate 1kn, Shimmering Flats on the other hand is awesome. 
---
I remember every time a poison would proc on my rogue, he would do a little cast animation. Not sure if that’s in the new classic.
---
The tavern song from Ratchet. 
---
I'm not expecting any issues with ninja looters because this behavior isn't common. It's not me spouting off about how everyone is going to be conspiring to steal gear for their friends.
---
I am not the one being paranoid.
---
Imagine you're in an MC pug with a big guild. A bunch of people in the guild you're pugging with need roll on an item that you need. 
---
One of them win the roll.
---
Do you really know what each of those players have equipped? Do you really know if it was an upgrade for every single player that rolled?
---
When one of them win the item with 5 rolls against your 1, they can then trade the item amongst themselves. Keep the upgrades in the guild, why give it to the random pug? It still gives them the illusion of a fair chance.
---
Loot trading can be abused even in ML situations, and it creates the same problem: **loot trading discourages playing with people you don't know,** which is the main way to make new friends.
---
It will certainly be less damaging if it only works with ML, but **loot trading is an unnecessary evil designed to poorly combat an issue which only happens 0.01% of the time (incorrect loot distribution).**
---
Just make loot mistakes zero tolerance. You have to live with your mistakes, just like every other mistake in the game.
---
Nano, the project lead for Nostalrius even stated that all of the numbers were guessed. They didn't know boss armor values, how damage scaled, the boss magic resistances... Etc. It's all guess work. None of it is accurate. This has been known for a while, so don't go comparing private server dps tests and expect them to translate into Classic wow.
---
100% this. It's a shit meme about a false dichotomy.
---
I love them they are so much h fun to solo on a warrior :)
---
Hopefully they do this. A nice middle ground to nerfing the instance farming.
---
You're correct, but the guess work they're talking about is in the 100s of armour, so at most 2-3% armour and 1-5% spell resistance. So yes, they don't know what the real values are, but no - it makes really no difference to our understanding of class mechanics and itemisation. It will be 99% transference to Classic.
---
Why would Blizzard allow people to falsely report like this, though? If someone were to mass report a guy for something he didn't do wouldn't that be dozens of people falsely reporting and getting their own temporary bans and warnings to not abuse the system?
---
Above a certain threshold your also LB does more damage than CL as the spell damage coefficient is higher on LB due to the slower cast time.
---
Contrary what some people would wish to believe, enchanting is a money sink at every stage of the game and rarely produces net profits for *anyone* who rolls the profession, even selling mats (as you need to factor in the marginal gold gained vs vendoring greens and the opportunity cost of losing another gathering profession.)
---
You can take herbalism and mining for Mara. There is a node at the very start that you "need" to farm anyway to let a patrol get passed you, otherwise you just wait idly.
---
No profession is crucial for Maraudon farming, though.
---
If you think you can farm Mara on a fresh Warlock without raid gear, you're in for a nasty surprise. Only hunters can farm Maraudon with fresh 60.
---
I've been level some characters on Vanilla/TBC pservers while waiting for Classic and have essentially been doing this. If I can buff them I'll do it - even if it means going out of my way to get in range to do so. If I pass someone on the path I always /wave them. If I see someone who pulled too many I help them. I don't always actually talk to them, but at least acknowledge them and buff them if I can. Those are the interactions people did for me I remember most back in the day. Trying to make the conscious decisions to help others come Vanilla. Never know when even something as small as a heal could help someone having a rough day.
---
And what about the inaccurate proc rates on items? Ironfoe for example, nobody knows the real proc rate. The same goes for nearly every item with a proc, there are so many things that people swear up and down that private servers have correct, and the fact is it's all guess work. Sure spec viability will be transferable, but there's no point trying to map out your DPS, it will be wrong.
---
If you’re not expecting this behavior then why bring it up constantly in your statements? Also any Classic WoW Pro-Loot Trading argument is built off of paranoia, and paranoia alone.
---
* Fyi it's there not their in this sentence. Their is like "their bike is blue" or "their mom is really nice." There is for locations. Over there is the store. There is where you'll find the books. Etc.

Lightning bolt scales better than chain lightning. Even in the good old days of 33/0/18 with imp CL my LBs did more damage than CL.

Of course if you got less spellpower than its reversed.

The tirion fordring chain in plaguelands,  Onyxia atunement, and the morbent fel chain.

im pretty sure all of the stealth things stacked, but there arent all that many in the first place. night elf passive, talents, and the boots/gothik boots. theres probably at least aonther item somewhere, but i dont play much rogue and dont have it internalized
---
I play on private servers.  People all join a chat called world (/join world) and find groups through that.  Discord has made it easy to find pugs.  I have a bunch of discord servers of good pug groups.  Oftentimes they will say like "@here going to make aq20 then zg at 19:00 server."  Then they get a bunch of decent people and if needed, go to world for the rest.  These discord servers also run MC/BWL/AQ40 pugs.  The best pug on my current server killed C'thun 3 weeks after aq40 release.
---
The most popular loot system right now is called soft reserve.  Basically, you can soft reserve any item in the instance.  If it drops, anyone soft reserved on it can roll on it.  If no one soft reserves it is free rolled MS&gt;OS.  
---
Yeah this seems like a pretty simple solution, or give the Master Looter a 30 second window to call back the item in the event of a misclick. Problem solved 
---
Woah, was getting all nostalgic reading though this thread then came across your post. Phire was the name of my main back in the day! I'm getting all misty eyed now...
---
Tauren Warrior. Make. Black, black, wide horns, bullring with three braids. 
---
I prefer: LB &gt; CL &gt; NS &gt; LB. because the LB and CL land at the same time, then you run at them for a shock if you need to
---
I guess you learn something new every day! I never learned to recognize Fear Ward over the years as I was always DPS, that's pretty great though.

The one in the water is one of my favorite ‘hidden’ quests, and it’s based off of a real letter written during the civil war.

Okay, so you ninja and get reported and get on blacklists. Nice one, you can still need roll without loot trading.
---
I don’t think I can enable or disable it. 
---
Are you retarded? I bring this behavior up because it's literally the reason people are saying "ZOMG LOOT TRADING BAD! EVERYONE GOING TO NINJA ALL MEH GEARZ!!11112"
---
One big problem with thid plan, shaman can't dual wield until BC.
---
U dont trow dots in raid. Dont be stupid, shadowbolt is desto spel. 
---
Same! Except I also want Wrath.
---
Not really a detail content wise but.... I remember being killed an absurd number of times by a skeleton elite in duskwood. Don’t remember his name or what even made him hard, but I remember he had a big ass sword and made my 12 year old self want to break the family computer.
---
... I assume the dwarf was casting fear ward. A dwarf walks on screen and casts something right as you start talking about fear ward.
---
What can a fresh 60 warlock farm?
---
Ideal farming targets for a warlock differ from a mage. While a mage wants highly clumped relatively low health melee mobs to be able to round them up and AoE,
---
warlocks want relatively high HP and high level mobs to chain kill with DoTs and Siphon Life.
---
Keeping this in mind just look at high level mobs with valuable loot tables. The elite demons in Winterspring, the elites in Tyr's hand, and if you're weaker, Satyrs in Felwood, plaguebats in EPL, and so on.
---
Once you get more gear as a warlock, instance farming starts becoming an option. Look at all the Maraudon warlock solo videos and you'll notice they all have at least t1 gear or equivalent.
---
You can still solo the princess if your technique is perfect, but to kill the goblin you need more damage (otherwise your VW will die too soon) and for the rotgrip you need *a lot* more damage (otherwise he will shrek both the VW and you).
---
It's simply not profitable if you can only kill princess, compared to herbing / chain mob killing.
---
Pug raiding doesn't happen until like, Naxx.
---
Most of us understand that sharding is a very _very_ necessary evil. 
---
Don't muddle this legitimate loot trading concern with that private server population bullshit. 
---
I should've explained that. Just copy and paste the link. It updates automatically when you make changes in the dressing room.
---
And it's the map has several big bottlenecks that pretty much forces alliance and horde to pass by each other in auto attack range.
---
Tell that to a fresh 60 who is behind the curve and is looking to put themselves out there to get into a good raiding guild.
---
Your comment is not only extremely ignorant it is inconsiderate of a vast portion the playerbase.
---
Okay but that doesn't solve the problem that Blizzard is trying to fix; which is cutting down on customer support tickets. If you don't provide a solution that solves that for them, they will throw your suggestion out the window.
---
Ok i did some quick testing. I duno if it was proper pre raid BiS, I just picked the best i could find off the 5 man vendors, so all blues no epics at all, no pvp gear.  
---
3 mins, lvl 58 target, no outside buffs, consumables or debuffs  
---
Rogue : 350 dps - combat swords  
---
Warrior : 370 dps  - fury dual wield  
---
Hunter : 390 dps  - BM with wolf lol (would be a lot higher if didn't run oom about 2 min in and with no multishot/sting at all)   
---
Mage : 450 dps but bone dry out of mana at 2:20 even after full evo and mana gem (fire/arcane)

If you think the sole reason people are saying loot-trading is bad is because of ninja looting you’re wrong and obviously don’t get it. They’re saying it’s bad because it changed the way people acted in groups and because it wasn’t in Vanilla WoW. Hell it wasn’t even in TBC.  
---
It is a fact that you only have to worry about one person (group leader) ninja looting by changing to master looter in a group with the original loot rules. 
---
It is also a fact that with loot trading the amount of people that could potentially ninja loot you for whatever reason goes from 1-4. 
---
This is not paranoia.  These are probability facts.
---
Selling items in raid pugs is absolutely a minority case. Great way to get banned from doing future pugs as there's really no way to advertise it without the RL finding out.
---
It pales in comparison to normal raid ML missclicks, which are definitely not one in ten thousand as you claim. Not sure what fantasy world you're living in.
---
I have not seen one decent argument from the pro loot trading people other than it saves GM time. Let's think about this hypothetical for a second. 
---
You are a rogue and have been running UBRS daily for 2 weeks for dal'rend and so far you only have the off hand, you join a group with a fury warrior and another rogue. You finally get to rend and the main hand drops, excited you roll need and you roll 76, higher than both the warrior and rogue. But unfortunately this other rogue has 2 friends with him in the group and they both roll need and the priest rolls an 88 snatching it from your grasp. Another example would be some random Druid on his own rolling a 99 and then selling it for the highest bid. People doing this with master loot is extremely rare and with loot trading ANYONE who joins the run can do this rather than just the group leader.
---
Without loot trading this would not have happened and trust me it's gonna feel like shit when it happens to you. Now that's one example of loot trading effecting players experience and the community negatively. However I think a decent middle ground would be to have loot trading only in effect while in raids and with master looter, that way actually important items don't accidentally go to the wrong person, the potential for abuse here is much lower (albeit still there in pugs) as loot is distributed manually by a master looter rather than simply based on rolling the dice and the system automatically giving you the loot.
---
I don't think player blacklists will be enough to dissuade people from doing this, there's always new players coming in and you can't expect a single person to keep track of every bad apple out of the potential thousands of level 60's on the server which means usually you won't know until you've been fucked over and you put them on your ignore list but he can always find someone else.
---
TL;DR: Loot trading is awful in group loot dungeons, less so in master loot raids. Player blacklists aren't enough to dissuade this kind of behavior even if you'd like to think they are.
---
Ion tweeted a couple times last month and I just shake my head thinking of how much dev time was lost. 
---
The Overwatch cinematics are still absolute industry gold standard. 
---
&gt;Selling items in raid pugs is absolutely a minority case. 
---
This is not what is being referred to. Let me try to simplify this more so you can understand.
---
You are a mage pugging with a big guild. Azuresong Mageblade drops.
---
Of course the guild wants to keep such a good item within their guild, to help their progression, and not give it to a random pug.
---
But as a pug, unless something is reserved, you should have equal right to roll on something - the whole point of pugging.
---
So you roll on the weapon, but so does 5 of the guild's mages and 3 of the guild's warlocks.
---
But wait a minute, do you know which one of those already have that weapon, or a better one? Do you know what each and every one of their casters is wearing?
---
We are in the same situation as your 1 roll against their 8 rolls.
---
One of them wins - and they give it to a guildie, **not sell it**, but trade it to a guildie so they can increase their raid dps for the guild.
---
And if it's just an easy raid like MC, they can easily unequip their existing Mageblades or better weapons, or trick you in any number of ways.
---
It is basically **the exact same problematic scenario that would happen in dungeons, but on a larger scale.**
---
Hopefully this was simple enough for you to understand this time.
---
I played vanilla WoW as a kid back in 2005-2006. Didn't make it to level 60 (highest level character was a level 57 warrior), but I enjoyed the hell out of it. Put in around 40 days of in-game playtime. I'm looking to play casually, maybe get into WoW in its current state but I'm most looking forward to playing WoW classic again. 
---
Looking for a laid back, organized guild that's interested in levelling, PvP, and raiding! The social aspect is huge for me as well, much of the fun of vanilla WoW was being a part of the community.
---
1. Intended region (NA/EU): **NA East Coast**
---
2. Intended server type (Nomal, PvP, RP, RP-PvP): **PvP or RP-PVP**
---
3. Intended faction: **Alliance** 
---
4. Intended raid/play times (with timezone): **Eastern Standard Time, nighttime with emphasis on weekends**
---
5. Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc): PvP, raiding, but above all, the social experience
---
6. Any pertinent rules: **n/a**
---
7. A preferred form of contact (PM, Discord link, website application): **PM me on Reddit**
---
Hahaha still pushing the fucking pug raid fantasy but even more unrealistic now as a whole guild joins a pug raid instead of raiding with their own guild.
---
Ridiculous. Go to bed you idiot.
---
Yes most are just educated guesses. Random ones that make no difference like Ironfoe no one knows about because it's a low level item so who cares. Ones that actually matter like BRE, Sulfuras and TF people did a lot of testing on and even if they're not 100% they certainly very close. If you think dps rankings of the classes and itemisation between blues/t2/Nax BiS is going to be dramatically different in Classic from PS you're just in for a bad time. No it's not exact but it does give us a very good idea of what to expect and anyone who cares should be using the info to plan what and how they'll play in Classic.
---
You're telling me you've never seen spots in a raid filled with PuGs?
---
I raid 5 times a week *right now* and it is absolutely commonplace to fill empty spots with pugs, and it was *when I played retail Vanilla as well.*
---
At this point I just have to assume you're trolling for some ulterior motive.
---
I don’t understand this argument. Noone has said or is saying people who play Vanilla were or are better people. We are saying the game has a strong sense of community and requires working with people to advance. None of this disallows people to be assholes, and is certainly not contingent on them adding loot trading.
---
Wands with +20 to fire, frost or shadow being pretty much equal BIS until naxx right? I never played caster 
---
I found the final part highly stressful, trying to get the blade breathed on by Ony without dying, and then hoping it’s not a wipe. I died the first time I tried to get in front of ony to drop it, but luckily we wiped and I got it easy the next attempt. As a main tank I’m sure it would be much easier 
---
Nineteen27! A familiar name to some around these parts.

It's crazy going back and watching these old PvP videos where two Mages are keyboard turning laps around each other, spamming arcane explosion.

Simpler times.
---
That's wild. I remember watching a bit after his initial rise, but man he just looks like hes totally lost it now.
---
Way to miss my point. 
---
Every served is supposed to be max 3-5k players for economy balance. And sharding is not a necessary evil. It is evil. It will ruin the gameplay experience for everyone. 
---
Blizzard can make more servers if they need it. Sharding is an excuse to be lazy. 
---
Anyone sharing your argument have never played vanilla. I wouldn't believe you if you said you had with that argument.
---
They’re developing classic for classic people, their priorities are completely different than retail. It’s in their monetary interest to nail classic as best as possible, and the content schedule shows they’re very much trying to achieve that. As much as this sub/r/wow  likes to spout stupid memes, they’re not stupid. 
---
Absolutely!  My plan is that I’m going to roll an undead mage and call him GnomePaladin
---
Why would there be any tickets?
---
If every knows that need will bind things to you and any tickets about it will be ignored people will learn to not open them. 
---
And if someone wants to trade a bop that they greed they can. 
---
Loooool. While I actually agree with your point that it’s a non-issue, because they wouldn’t be answered, saying 
---
&gt; Stop using Blizzard GM time management as a shit crutch for a poor argument about an 11 billion dollar corporations financing.
---
Is completely pants on head stupid. You don’t ever reach a point where you can carelessly throw around money on wasteful things, whether you’re Amazon, or some mom and pop bakery, or anything in between. And yes, GMs to answer loot tickets would be the very definition of super wasteful spending. 
---
Feels good seeing the sub slowly grow with content such as this 
---
Oh I’ll definitely have 1. And my second is going to follow joana’s leveling guide so maybe there will be time
---
But then you can get a warlock who will pretend to go along with the others the. Outbid them by 1 and win an item.  The other warlocks can't complain to the guild because then they get in trouble for trying to game the system. 
---
Well that’s completely personal preference. I much prefer new models, but I also don’t care if people like the old ones. But no one can say either is objectively better for or against really. 
---

Ah, I missed the EU part.  Tichondrius is a US server.

Pvp didnt give xp in vanilla

No pvp xp so you don't need to worry.  Besides the only twinks worth making were lvl 1 twinks with BIS white gear and fiery enchant.
---
While the Intel UHD 617 is a toaster by modern standards, I.e. 20xx series, it should be able to cut through classic wow fairly easy, albeit probably at low either that resolution. 
---
I mean yeah an ultra tight/compact laptop, regardless of the make, is absolutely gonna run hit and loud, no getting around thermodynamics haha
---
Smoke should have been Plagueis. Oh What could have been...
---
This is due to wows single core reliance, of which any laptop is going to be significantly weaker here than a desktop unless it’s designed for gaming. The new multi core support should help, but even with the UHD 17 you have to limit it to low at that resolution. 
---
&gt; Blizzard can make more servers if they need it
---
Good job admitting you don't understand what the problem even is.
---
You played yourself. Give yourself a pat on the back.
---
It’ll get warm, but they throttle roughly in the same ballpark as other ultralight laptops. Ultralights/non gaming in general should not be your first choice for any game really 
---
Nice troll. Either that or you're thick in the head.
---
It will, just not at great frames at that resolution, obviously.  Plenty of people in this thread have done it. While not ideal, it’ll work...
---
&gt; Also who (of the players) gives a damn fuck about a good business model. 
---
You misinterpret me.  I'm not saying the "good business model" is a good thing for players.  I remember the days after EQ was a big success and UO was not, and all the business types decided that forcing players to group was what made EQ successful.  So *Anarchy Online* forced players to get buffs from other players just to put on their equipment, and *Dark Age of Camelot* had character builds that did absolutely nothing actively, they just passively buffed other characters, which didn't cause people to group, it just let people solo if they paid for two accounts.  These things were "so popular" (I'm being sarcastic here) with players that no other game since has copied them.  But the games implemented them because "good business model".
---
So maybe players don't actively think about the business model, but I remember being screwed over because of business models.
---
People will throw in tickets whether it's allowed or not.
---
Plus, telling your most devout customers to go fuck themselves over simple missclicks is just not good for business. There's a reason they permit (and always have permitted) this limited form of loot trading on retail in the first place.
---
Don’t bother with the windows version through boot camp, that’s only applicable for Mac games that haven’t updated their graphics api to Metal, because DirectX is significantly better at game specific rendering (whereas OpenGL was designed for different types of GPU work). WoW has used Metal for a while, and is the same as directx from a performance standpoint due to its new design. 
---
&gt; You're telling me you've never seen spots in a raid filled with PuGs?
---
Without the good items being reserved? No, actually, I really haven't. Not sure what kind of weird guilds you're playing in but I guess it must be really fucking bad if you need 5 nights a week to clear the vanilla raids.
---
And get kicked off the secret discord so losing out long term. No reason anyone would. Also you'd only do something like this with people you trust in the first place. 
---
Thats now how conversations work and thats not how master looter works either lol. Please get away from our game and play retail if you want Loot Trading.
---
Good for you.
---
It’ll get warm, but they throttle roughly in the same ballpark as other ultralight laptops. A proper functioning laptop will simply throttle, not overheat and shutdown, if that’s happening then something is malfunctioning, same applies with macs or windows laptops. Ultralights/non gaming in general should not be your first choice for any game really
---
You _literally_ don't even understand the issue. This is hilarious. Did you time travel from mid 2018? Or have you just been living under a rock? Want some lottery numbers my dude?
---
Exactly - this guy has no idea what hes talking about and the 15 deep downvotes at the time of this writing show it lol.
---
If you join a group and someone puts it on master loot, or if someone puts on master loot right before a boss pull - everyone has transparency and it cannot be abused. Literally the opposite of Loot Trading, which does not belong in classic.
---
The quest from 1-60

I feel like loot council is one of the worst ideas for 40-man raids. You will constantly lose raiders to other guilds because they won't agree with who you gave the gear to or they'll just get pissed that they aren't getting any gear compared to other people. Loot council only really works in hardcore guilds where everyone is on the same page and understands exactly where the biggest powerspikes from gear are coming from and are happy the raid group is getting stronger as opposed to an individual. This is not something you'll see anywhere else, people raid because they want gear for themselves.                                   
---
Same thing with warriors sword spec, my mate had a screenshot of us in Arathi basin where he 1 shot a mage with 4 sword spec procs in a row off each other.
---
As people said, there was no xp in pvp.
---
But also, you had to plan out your gear in advance and go out of your way to get it as soon as possible, without going over the xp limit
---
Lol of course people will keep bad gear on them for this purpose, they’ll only have to use one or two slots in each dungeon depending on what item they’re going for. Sure it’ll be easy to spot a mage rolling on a healing item but you’ll have no clue if a mage is rolling for his warlock friend or worse yet a rogue rolling on leather for his tank buddies fury set
---
I would go with the Icicle rod. +dmg is usually a good stat for all dps casters.
---
Hey, feel free to log into [redacted] pserver and have a gander at my guild. We're 15/15 Naxx cleared, and we have Thunderfury. 2 people almost have their Ateish (we absorbed one from another guild).
---
I would be happy to log onto any server you're playing on and see how fantastic your guild is.
---
Yet, here you'll find 99% of druid threads claiming that bear threat is amazeballs.
---
&lt;Midlife Crisis&gt;
---
Because ML is public and would damage their reputation, loot trading is private and wont, how do you continually fail to acknowledge this?
---
Resto druids and hunters. Any leather gear with int goes to resto druids, although they have to compete for offset pieces with other healers. Mail gear is going to Hunters who have to compete with rogues for offset pieces. Plus, guilds aren't bring that many druids or hunters. 
---
Of course, the other side of that is that guilds aren't bringing that many of those classes, so you may find yourself without a raiding group unless you stand out.
---
this guy goes around trolling every other post. so many utterly down voted. just look at his history. who knows what his deal is? why is he going around trolling nonstop?
---
“Hey lf1m party member, we use ml though” as it takes them much longer to fill their group because people dont trust ml groups, plus when they ninja gear their reputation will be damaged
---
Thanks, in my mind a blue item is always superior to a green and didn't want to accept the contrary. But in this case I think I will go with the icicle rod then.
---
You just don't really understand what the problem is if adding more servers is your solution to dead servers when tourists leave.
---
i do say sell those marbles an early silver can go a long away and the usefulness is very low (useless u wanna cheese a super early rag kill before the tank has his FR set).  
---
But fishliver oil ([https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1322/fishliver-oil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1322/fishliver-oil)) can be usefull if wanna bank it untill the Omen+Darkmoon faire week and go for a big Speedrun or super fast boss kills.
---
Who was it? Making sure it wasn’t me. 
---
What “old guide book” was this?
---
I think loot trading should only exist for greed rolls. Need rolls should be permanent and BoP. 
---
Shatter works on all spells, but not wands 
---
When people are opening a ticket you have a category for loot issues with some help text stating that all need rolls are final. 
---
If you aren't mature enough to accept that you probably shouldn't be playing an online game anyway. 
---
But it only works if you have all the warlocks in on it. 
---
Of transmog was a thing in classic, I would probably go for a look like this. I plan on rolling up an RP server, so I hope to one day get the whole exalted set just for walking around town. It's one of my favorites. Ashbringer is not likely as I probably won't see Nax, and I'll definitely won't get to roll on it, but whatever. 
---

---
I think the extra stats &gt; the 10 frost damage. Both are great though. 
---
You obtain only a single item by outbidding by 1 dkp. But then you destroy the entire system you had running, and now not only do your former co-conspirators have to start paying massively more DKP, but so do you.  
---
In the end, anyone with a brain wouldn't do it.  
---
Yes it's not great, but you can stick with it.
---
As a retadin you've gotta be willing to do less damage than other DPS classes, it's the nature of the game. Instead focus on the utility you can bring to the raid, such as nightfall, as well as the fat crits you can get in PvP
---
I love your content, Frost. Keep up the good work.
---
Man you really struck early for today's repost. It's not even Sunday in California yet.  
---
(Edges close to you ear. ) "You neeeeeeeed?"
---
Due to the lack of accessible spell power at that level, I'd stick with raw stats 100%.  
---
Flat +dmg is the greatest thing during lvling. Intellect is very very minor dmg boost. 59,6 int is 1% spell crit chance.
---
/thread
---
I remember the flight paths thing too. Even though I think it would be nice to have multi paths in there I want to not have it to keep it more classic &gt;&lt;
---
&gt;I understand this is reddit and people post shit all the time saying shit is theirs when its not, but I can assure you this was made by me and my buddy a long time ago 
---
I can attest, he did it. 
---
I don't live in the US, im in the UK and wrote this while getting ready for work.
---
If this is too repetitive on what has already been on this sub I'll delete it, I didn't realize.
---
As long as plain vanilla servers remain an option for those who want to opt out of this, I don't see a problem with it. If Classic were to be successful enough for Blizzard to entertain this idea (considering they already stated they don't want to run Classic like a proper MMO they aren't anticipating putting more work into it lol) then it's their money, I don't see the problem. I'd probably try it out
---
But WoW got to the point it currently is in part due to feedback from the players, so I feel like this is a "be careful what you wish for" kind of thing.
---
Also if your a frost mage you should try and pick up the azure silk set from tailors in order to stack that frost dmg. Some pieces are from limited recipes so on like the gloves and cloak will be slightly more expensive. Idk how much your server is progressed but on the one I play on the gloves are usually AHed for around 2-5g.
---
Yeah, I see what you mean. But the poor feedback from players is part of the reason for the 75% vote, it has to be incredibly popular to make it in. 
---
I for one tend to agree that it’s pointless to argue.  But not because the argument doesn’t have some valid points only Bc it’s happening even if we all bitch and moan about it.  Either way it’s a human interaction so someone will always be aiming to secretly screw the other over inevitably

I wasn't able to get the collector's edition pet the first time around.

This is who taught me how to pvp as a mage.... [Enter The Void 3](https://youtu.be/jSpSmFXWBWA?t=923) Along with Vurtne and Otherguy
---
Lowest bracket was 10-19
---
All the research won't be enough preparation because semi-hardcore guilds, especially on horde side, are doing things very differently than they did back in the day. Experienced semi-hc/hc guilds nowadays actually fit the "casual schedule, hardcore preparation" you aim to be going for because they focus on always bringing their best and thus crush content within a few hours. So what they are doing is what you probably want to look at. This is also the reason why I don't give you a specific raid setup. Just go and bring up a raid logs website and you'll see what people's raid comps look like.
---
Misinformation, let me explain it with one specific point: Feral druids. There is a feral druid thread on this subreddit every other day with people stating how they're doing a lot of threat and whatnot. The truth is that feral druids on horde side are insufficient.  
---
What is worse is that you including TWO of them will not avoid drama but create drama, specifically from loot pressure and player performance. How do I know? Because I am playing feral druid as my main alt character since several servers and yes I tank raids (MC/BWL alt raids and pugs plus 20mans but I also helped out in AQ40 on a previous server) on them. But I also main warrior tank in a dedicated "main offtank"/"second main tank" role and feral druid performance is just insufficient with the presence of windfury and absence of salvation. They can still work as an offtank but it requires the player to be very dedicated to always perform at his best while being okay with still performing sub-par while simultaneously being okay with receiving next to no loot. There are no dedicated feral druid items and the few items that are considered as such are usually so bad that a feral druid isn't even looking forward to getting them.  
---
What is worse is that the items a feral druid wants are all so contested between rogues, dps warriors, hunters and even maintanks, that giving a good amount of those items to a feral druid cannot really be justified if you're going straight by performance because a feral druid on horde side - even with those items - won't be able to reliably perform to the standards a high DPS horde raid requires.
---
If you are set on just starting a guild and building it from the ground up while hoping to find exactly the right kind of players that are both competent in playstyle and leadership to fill the officer spots, you are welcome to do it. But from my experience across servers, being both inside officer teams and outside officer teams, success of a guild usually relies heavily on the leadership and their ability to herd cats and teach those cats how to jump through hoops in the most efficient and graceful manner. There are absolutely people out there who are capable and willing to do it and you'll probably get a couple in your guild and maybe you'll be able to figure out who it is and maybe you'll be able to avoid promoting the wrong guys or maybe you'll be able to run it mostly as a one-man-show. I've seen it work before. But I've also seen it crash and burn too many times, so that I'd rather join a guild made by someone who has done the whole vanilla guild thing before.
---
When did they add in the NPC that let you turn off experience gain? I think it was in TBC.
---
It's a fucking pain, extraordinarily difficult, and so damn satisfying!
---
I recommend trying out each fight once or twice to get a feel for the.mechanics rhen going in with full consumes. The exceptions to that are BS and WS: BS you just want near max weapons skill and a major mana potion, WS you just want as much mana as possible and a major mana pot. Elixirs of demonslaying are always worth popping.
---
I think this sort of downtime is also why you got to know people and form friendships in classic, because you had time to talk while waiting for everyone to arrive at the dungeon, waiting for the entire 40 man raid to ready up or waiting for the server exclusive pvp queue which meant there weren't always new BGs popping up.
---
Having some downtime isn't necessarily a bad thing in a social online game (within reasonable limits).
---
&gt;  loot winner can return loot to corpse / master looter
---
Im surprised i havent seen this suggestion before (or at least enough to remember it).  That would be an excellent solution for most of the accidental 'wrongful loot' situations.
---
Sure, you'll still have ninjas, but loot trading isnt going to fix that in any way, shape or form.  Being able to return it to a ML/roll would give everyone a fair shot again (unless your ML is corrupt, which again...isnt an issue that loot trading will fix)
---
I was under the impression that at lower levels +Damage was so low it was better to take raw stats. Is that not true?
---
Personally I'll be rolling a PvE server, as I prefer to avoid the frustration of getting ganked when I just want to quest.
---
I did engage in a some wPvP on private servers, but that was in response to being attacked, or defending others who were attacked.
---
I very much hope this a common thing come release!
---
I disagree, but I respect your opinion.
---
Maraudon has them ghost mushrooms.
---
Good post.
---
This is a pretty decent explanation of what PvP servers offer to people who enjoy a more actively tense feeling while playing MMOs.
---
Personally I find it draining.
---
Paladin has been stated by blizzard to be mechanically made to be easiest. As long as she intends on healing this is a good option, for damage I would suggest frost or arcane mage since it can be easier in raid settings. Frostbolt/blizzard
---
I wish I could buff randoms as a huntard :(
---
Guess a /wave will have to suffice. 
---
Why is this so difficult? Add another confirmation dialogue to master looter - "Are you sure you want to loot [item] to [player]?", if you mess up several times you don't get a re-do. It's a ridiculous suggestion to consider adding a new mechanic that changes the game instead of just a fail-safe confirmation dialogue which accomplishes the same thing 99% of the time.  
---
Loot trading encourages people to change their mind, it's not needed to fix missclicks.

Well if you only cast on particular type of spell then the +frost dmg will be better than the little bit of dmg int will give you at low lvls. Int is still very important for having a large enough mana pool. Stam is less useful for a mage than it would be for like a lock. If your on a pvp server I would prioritize stam a little more so you don't get one-shotted by rogues.
---
Not trolling, you'll get a lot more out of vendoring skins on a fresh economy than you would selling on the AH.
---
Right... but that doesn’t mean you’re not allowed to play alliance
---
While it does seem fun at times, I have no intention on playing on a PvP server when Classic launches. I don't have nearly as much time to play the game as I did back in the day, so I'd prefer if my time wasn't wasted by getting GY camped or forcing me to logoff and play at a different time. 
---
Plus, BGs will be released, which suffices my lust for some PvP action (especially AV), so its not like I'm locked out of PvP forever. 
---
I’d like to see you 1v1 a devilsaur on a fresh 60 Warrior. 
---
[My Tauren Warrior](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Ro0z0zJ89mk9Mz9m87T)
---
These kinds of threads are exactly why everyone says that every loot system has its pros and cons and that there will literally never be a perfect loot system.
---
From a few years as an officer, I learned that you just kinda gotta roll with what your raid wants. If you and your GM are the only ones that want DKP but literally every other raider wants loot council/EPGP/other, then you probably should please the masses.
---
Granted, this probably won't work at all in a hardcore guild, but, you know - you could try. 
---
Yeah, because your guild was bad.
---
Winter's Chill AND Improved Scorch up at the same time? Lol.
---
If the rest of your guild's DPS were competent and optimal, the hunters are nowhere near top 5.
---
Yeah, isn’t there a squid one with some AGI? And a one with high level STA for warriors. I believe Turtle Soup is the MP5 one, if not that’s ones sought after for raiding. 
---
Tfw the tank dies right then
---
Holy hell was that a nightmare, lol
---
If they put in loot trading, be sure to make a GM ticket whenever you suspect something like this going on.
---
WotLK I believe
---
Is it bad that empathy and common sense just aren't there anymore? This etiquette seems to only be followed by cool headed folks.
---
Well, when I was leveling my priest, I was told to always prioritize stats over damage&amp;healing. But I know priests are different because of how inefficient their +damage gear is on Mind Flay. 
---
Yep, I paid for the guild's Ventrilo back in the day and I'm 42. Cant wait to no life this game again!!!
---
What’s a good farming spot for a fresh 60 Warrior? Just run 5 mans?
---
Yeah. Idk about leveling a preist. Gonna be maiming a warlock myself in Classic. Even if your a shadow dps  I wouldn't prioritize shadow dmg gear. I would go for the more "universal" stats so you can still heal in 5man groups.
---
A single BRD full clear at 55-60 takes the same time/ longer than any zone 1-12. I can do 1-12 anywhere in 3ish hours. 
---
Just play your race, play a solid day and you’ll be 15-20 and on your way. 
---
I've heard it go both ways. The argument for int over damage - rarely are mobs' health just enough so that +dmg cuts one cast out of your rotation. But that +crit and +mana from int can.
---
The counterargument is "it cuts down on wanding needed tho". So who knows, they're both pretty good, you can't really go wrong
---
Yeah, I think the other big difference for Mage and Shadow Priest is drinking. If you’re playing a Shadow Priest right, you never have to drink, and you only cast enough spells to bounce between 50% and 80% mana because of Spirit Tap. A Mage basically has to drink every fight, so might as well just kill things as quickly as possible. 
---
There was 100% no Theramore port in Vanilla. It was added TBC or even WOTLK maybe.
---
Awesome, thanks ! I wasn’t sure if I couldn’t find it or it just wasn’t there lol
---
Gotta take that boat from menethil.
---
No worries, glad I can help!
---
Yeah I was just trying to travel the world get the teleports in my spare time but couldn’t find the one in theremore , obviously for good reason haha
---
how'd the mage come into this??
---
At least the graveyard was nearby. 
---
Ba-dum-tiss?
---
My friend told me about a giant game that hundreds of players can play together. After lots of hours being lost in Dun Morogh I found the Questlog for the first time and messaged my friend: "Lol dude, you said this game was massive and I'm already at quest 6 out of 20 after a few hours"
---
&gt; Besides the only twinks worth making were lvl 1 twinks with BIS white gear and fiery enchant.
---
10-19 was the biggest twink bracket dude....
---
followed by 20-29
---
Bonus points for having the character be a female elf hunter, lol
---
I remember the first time I started tanking on my original dwarf warrior. I obviously sucked at it at first but I picked it up fast and became pretty decent at it. Being able to hold aggro on multiple mobs with a warrior was considered borderline pro level in the early days. Got an invite to a guild after tanking with 3 eventual guildies in bfd. That moment lead me to being primary OT, raiding up to Twin Emps and, most importantly, making friendships with people that still last to this day. I never had experienced that prior to WoW and I havent really experienced it since. Guild events eventually turned into RL meet ups which turned into actually knowing the people behind the voices. It literally MADE the game for me. If it wasnt for the constant attrition we would have cleared AQ40. It was our goal. Sadly, our core group just couldnt drag enough of the new recruits forward. I had plenty of opportunities to move to a different guild. Even to be a MT but the thought of leaving that core group behind was a bridge too far for me...
---
I talked with a number of people from my old core group about bringing the band back together again but no one has sounded that interested sadly. Yet, even if none of them come back I'll gladly march on towards our shared dream of finally beating all of AQ40. I can wait. God willing I find some new people to group with to share some laughs, Chuck Norris jokes and plenty of drunken moments over comms
---
Oh yeah! I would hate if they removed that, but I'm quite sure it'll be in or fixed.
---
Except good luck inflicting societal punishment as a form of justice when you are outnumbered as potentially the only pug in a group. It comes down to their word against yours, and you're just asking for drama circulating around your name by calling out this injustice, because in the end it's better you bite the bullet and suffer from getting loot stolen in a majority of cases, then raise a stink and have people question bringing you because of slander involving your name. 
---
A loot ninja on the other hand almost always operates for themselves and has to deal with the outcry of potentially 4 other people in his group aka witnesses. Loot trading in general has a potential to create more problems of a far larger severity than it attempts to solve.
---
&lt;Pwn's your Mom&gt;
---
I think you posted in the wrong thread ^^
---
All the quests I haven't done. I've never gotten an Alliance character above level 35, always been Horde.
---
 I want to experience Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Blasted Lands, WPL &amp; EPL etc. from an Alliance perspective.
---
Keep it away from dungeons. That solves the biggest issue with it.
---
I remember leveling with shaman in 2004-05. No online guides, just trial
---
And error. Did a combo of ele/enhance. Not sure if there’s a META way of leveling Shammie. No dual wield.
---
Mana hungry. Not for the faint of heart
---
Theramore mage portal was added in 2.4.2 :) 
---
Compulsive collectors always feel "forced" to buy, as many gamers are. He lashes out simply because he have no self-control.
---
Both my lvl 19 and my partners lvl 29 twinks accidently leveled at some point. Gutted haha. O well just level him and make him my main for next xpac. 
---
I loved this. I remember always putting on poisons on poison-immune bosses anyway just because it looked cool.
---
Horde Rogue LF semi-hardcore raiding guild - EU.
---
I would like to ressurect my undead rogue for classic and am looking to find a semi-hardcore raiding guild (3-4 raids a week).
---
PVP server would be best.
---
I plaied vanilla back in the day and raided semi actively up to mid AQ40, guild went innactive when the TBC pre patch went live and raiding stopped.
---
In TBC I got up to Muru and in WotLK we downed LK heroic.
---
I dropped out after that and have been playing on and off since then but nothing too serious.
---
I know the game very well and am a smart guy.
---
I'm looking for a guild with like minded people who have a sense of humor and will be able to be as active as me.
---
If you know of such a group let me know, I would love to join.
---
PS: I might be able to get aome of my old guildies in too, we've somehow managed to keep in touch even though we haven't really played actively together for years.
---
Cheers!
---
What?! Fuck that place. All those Scorpions can such a nut. I hate Shimmering Flats, 1kn on the other hand is ... Worse.
---
The worst cases of this and the most important as well, will be in prebis 10 man runs in ubrs for items like briarwood Reed for casters or truestrike/dalrends for melee. It's obvious OP has never had to do that grind. You will see groups of 10 with 7 people who all want one item. Being able to have 3 or 4 friends come with you and quadruple your chance for the item will be abused like crazy.
---
Loot trading will literally CAUSE GM tickets.... not Prevent them...
---
Since the classic devs listen to the community members who have actually played through this content and understand it well (as we have seen in the 6 releases announcement), I trust that they know this as well and will not include loot trading in the game.
---
Call of Water for my water totem :)
---
Sorry man, I'm only a cloth dps class officer and know next to nothing about melee classes.
---
I do see a lot warriors run Strath live, and reserve the first Righteous Orb drop for gold. That depends on economy, though.
---
Slime
---
wow 33/33/33 split.  
---
As one of the new server lets tell you how I was disapointed with burning crusade:  
---
No hyjal, no kultiras, none of the blank spaces zones filled out that that had not been created, eg gilnaes.  
---
Increasing the level cap  
---
Adding to the talent trees,  
---
 level 58 gear ruing level 60 gear  
---
Flying  
---
Group finder
---
Or the ORAS approach 🤪
---
Classic+ with original servers still being preserved would be ideal. Burning Crusade onward ruined the game with flying, arenas, etc and fresh servers only work because of the instability of private servers and how they would constantly shut down, forcing you to new ones regardless. If they do either, it's the point of no return. Wrath servers come out, "Classic Cataclysm time guys!"
---
An osrs player I was thinking about this the other day that it would be a neat idea, this also protects the developers from making content the players don’t like as it is being voted on.
---
Lookin good on that dwarf, gamer
---
I did!
---
The only problem i would point out here is for things such as arena, they are wildly popular. Most big wow classic pvpers seem to like that about TBC, with many naming the lack of arenas as a big downside of wow classic. I do think that arena's would receive over 75% of the vote, especially with much of the new audience wow vanilla will receive after its blizz launch 
---
I think I'm just going to revel in it, not trying to run ahead like a maniac haha. I'll squeeze out probably 6 hours of semi-casual gameplay a day.  Won't take vacation for it.
---
that's what they do. these people that agree with loot trading are just stubborn and can't actually give solid reasons why it is a good idea, because there are none
---
Aaand now I am sad. I really loved the idea of Theramore/Stonard being so important towns storywise that even though they weren´t capitals, mages were able to make portals to them.
---
Oh, so you're only using a small portion of all group PvE content that is generally only done with a cherry picked select group of individuals from your guild such as a raid as a basis and then apply that stupid perspective to everything else in the game.  Nice
---
the thing is you won't even know people are dicking you over lol...if they are friends the friend will have unequipped the item before the dungeon starts. acting like they both need it, just to give to the other friend. lets say for example briarwood reed in UBRS. there is high competition for that and having a friend being able to roll for you is a big advantage. you can run UBRS a lot but have bad luck not getting the rare spawn, him not dropping it, or losing rolls
---
This reminds me of [something from a movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6cxWDrvIsI)
---
&gt;GMs to answer loot tickets would be the very definition of super wasteful spending. 
---
GMs WILL NOT ANSWER LOOT TICKETS.  What the fuck is with everyone in this thread.
---
A few years later: ...Anyways, here's LFR.
---
That’s what I said. 
---
if two friends use the same type gear, say one has a pre raid BIS item and the other needs it. one would unequip the item before the dungeon making it look like he needs it also, therefore his friend gets two rolls. you would never even know to blacklist them lol. how people are cool with this just because people 
---
I seem to be the odd one out here, but unless I was in a dungeon I'd want the most stam and int I could possibly get.
---
&gt; It will ruin the gameplay experience for everyone.
---
I'll play devil's advocate here for a moment and say that as a player who was there at release, the gameplay experience was an absolute nightmare. Servers crashed constantly, queues were hours long, the lag was unimaginable and doing virtually anything was a chore. Blizzard ended up handing out free game time for players and Mike posted a big apology on the official forums. Bear in mind that this wasn't even including issues with tagging mobs or doing quests, because quite frankly even killing something was an accomplishment. *And* I was doing this at Australian time, so it wasn't even at it's worst. 
---
Sharding may not be an ideal solution but I sure as hell know that Blizzard doesn't want a repeat of vanilla release. 
---
yep it's pretty fuckin funny lol. misclicking is actually the non-issue here
---
A very long time ago.. someone was patient when you wiped the entire group. Be patient with your fellow noob and show them how it’s done. 
---
* Intended region : EU
---
* Intended server type : PvP
---
* Intended faction: Horde
---
* Intended raid/play times : UK evenings, probably only an hour an evening though :( Hey, I didn't have kids the first time around...
---
* Any priority you may have in a guild : I'd like to raid occasionally but realistically this is going to be a nostalgic social experience for me. Not looking for a hardcore guild for those reasons
---
* A preferred form of contact : I have discord. Haven't done much multiplayer gaming in recent years.
---
And how is it poor design for shaping community interactions?
---
add someone to your shitlist when you can't possibly even know they had a friend roll for them because he unequipped his pre raid BIS item before the dungeon..makes sense
---
You gotta pump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.
---
blocked
---
It looks as though it's from the 2004 BradyGames WoW Guide.
---
Go ahead and get the third. Gotta have that guide and browser monitor, plus a stream/video monitor!
---
Whatever looks the most fun to her. Any race / class combo that looks cool is definitely where she'll have the best experience.
---
That said, beast mastery Hunter is the easiest
---
In theory, +dmg stacking is supposedly better but tbh doesn’t really come in to its own until those pieces also start appearing with a few stats on them.
---
You’re going to need hp and intel, some spirit too. Especially on a PvP server. 
---
Because people can ninja stuff "under the radar" so to speak. They can need on an item because they "supposedly" need it, and then trade it to their friend after the dungeon/raid has ended. Or even worse, they can make a business of selling loot, basically holding the item hostage.
---
Either way, loot trading will be detrimental to classic.
---
I believe this was explained by many people in great detail, but to summarize, loot trading encourages various behaviors unwanted by the community because of the perceived unfairness and dishonesty they introduce. 
---
One such example is bringing guild members/friends to your party, so they'd roll on things they don't need, but you do, which increases your chance of winning items. It might also not always be obvious you were tricked as those trades aren't public, and they might be won by a normally eligible class for such an item.
---
Piccolo of flaming fire
---
And then the person who rolled- and won and item can sell it afterwards anyways, totaly under the radar, without anyone knowing except for himself and the buyer.
---
Nice.
---
Not really.
---
Yep. The meme was created by a blizzard apologist shill.
---
The game being built around community doesn't mean everyone in the community will be amazing.  It means your interactions are with actual people instead of with the game's built-in systems.
---
You need to actually talk to people to find a group.  You need to actually talk to people to discuss loot.  You need to actually talk to people in order to succeed at the game.
---
if two people are in the same guild, its extremely easy to have your friend roll for you if they use the same type gear. they could already have that pre raid BIS and just unequip it before the dungeon. idk how this is so hard to understand for some people. people keep saying blacklist how the hell are you gonna blacklist when they are sneaky about it. with ninja masterloot its in your face, you know, boom blacklisted. 
---
I will need for friends and my friends will need for me. This will become the new normal. If you need the item.i just won whisper me and ill sell it to you for vendor price or highest bidder if several people need it. Well, unless my friend need it. THIS will be the new normal! 
---
It is more fair than vanilla, as even my healer that is already decked out can run dungeons for money.
---
Still would prefer the old way, but i can live with loot trading.
---
If you join a group that has an openly reserved item, you're doing it on your own choice. You arent getting fucked by some random group of dudes who trade loot amongst themselves after the fact.
---
Loot trading and reserving are MILES appart in terms of what it does to the game.
---
you are incorrect with bis lists, redemption was added after patch 1.10
---
check full list of added items here: [https://imgur.com/a/Aiw6Yx3](https://imgur.com/a/Aiw6Yx3)
---
they must be excluded from your bis list at first 5 phases
---
inb4 master looter gives bindings to the Hunter just to troll  the main tank then has a power outage and disconnects :p
---
People dont need to be in the same guild to be friends you know.
---
Either way, you cant compare loot trading to reserving. They are completely different things. One thing is out in the open, one thing is cloak and dagger.
---
This comment should be immortalized as a bot that posts automatically in every thread with "loot trading" in the title. You don't really have to reinvent the wheel here, it's not that fucking hard :p
---
Very well put. I couldnt have said it better myself. This is EXACTLY what I've been trying to tell the blizzard-loot-trading-shill-apologists but they seem to be immune to common sense.
---
enchants for phase 1 also incorrect, there will be no dire maul at the start to finish the librams of focus
---
No, it wont. There is splenty of loot categories shared between multiple classes and specs in vanilla. It will not be entirely obvious who needs what in every single circumstance.
---
thanks for the input, will update asap!
---
Cairnstone silver wand is a quest reward for killing lvl 50 mobs, not doable at lvl 42 (at least solo)
---
Extremly well crafted real world example of what *will* happen if loot trading makes it into vanilla.
---
Blizzard is on record stating that arena was a mistake that permeated all design decisions going forward.
---

---
"If I was going to pick on a game design thing that I look back on and think was a mistake? We really never designed WoW to be a competitive e-sports game; it was something that we decided to start tackling because there was such a desire and demand to evolve it in that direction, to introduce competitive arenas. I'm not sure that that was the right thing to do with the game."
---
I dont think we donating materials will accualy help speed up things. It must be on a timer. A long timer. Just like warfronts. They all become active in about the same number of days whether people donated or not. 
---
Explanation*
---
just let the community police themselves, no gm intereference whether it was miss clicks or ninja looting.  
---
Nice strawman.
---
No one is queing for Mythic dungeons and getting teleported to the dungeon
---
I'm planning on rolling EU, but playing from SEA with a 7 hour time difference. I'll be returning to the UK eventually and dont want my characters  to be on an Asian server, so its going to be interesting playing so out of sync with the rest.
---
I'm hoping I'll find some good material farms when the rest of the server is sleeping, probably won't be able to find a raid schedule except on weekends though.
---
I didn’t donate a scrap the last time and was still there for my guilds first Cthun kill ;) which wasn’t server first but was barely a few weeks behind. Blackrock USA alliance were a hardcore bunch. 
---
It doesn't encourage anything unless you're a kid with no manners. You're paranoid and odd if you seriously believe this'll be a problem since it was NEVER a problem when loot trading was introduced. You're creating a problem that doesn't exist. 
---
i kinda like your guide, everything is compact and informative though ) but some info is incorrect
---
Not if the trade/sell happens after the raid/dungeon has ended and noone knows it even happend.
---
Trees doesnt make a sound when they fall in the forrest and noone is there to see it.
---
He can make fan trailers, sure. He might even do that. But he's not going to make official blizzard trailers, because he doesn't work for blizzard, as I explained in the post above.
---
True, for the minority of players who go beyond LFD and LFR, teleports aren't a thing.  
---
There's just something inherently wrong with being able to complete the game (storywise atleast) from the main city, using an options menu.
---
Maintank hands down.
---
As a druid you might get full t2 in one lucky run, but you still compete for jewelry against everyone. 
---
True, but you dont have *as many reasons* to ninja with the old system. With loot-trading you give a person many more reasons to do it.
---
As we all know, opportunity makes the thief, not the other way around.
---
The modern WoW doesn't really give you an impression of playing with people. If LFD and LFR was completely traded out with A.I. you wouldn't notice a difference, given the A.I. was required to AFK 20% of the time in LFR. When something is as unpersonal as the current systems make other players, things like empathy starts dissapearing. And that kind of attitude seeps over to the rest of the game modes that are similar in nature.
---
And on the other hand, just because I'm horde doesn't mean I can't go to Redridge &gt;:) 
---
Yes but then it would be out in the open.
---
working on it! I still expect some things to change until launch so it will be a work in progress until all the info is set in stone.
---
They introduced personal loot in retail *because* this was one of the issues they wanted to adress.
---
Yes, everyone already having stockpiled the items to turn in the second it comes up is lame.
---
We need to nerf Naxx gear before doing this, the gear is far too strong.
---
this happens constantly on live, why do you think it wouldn't happen on classic?
---
This is a bad strawman meme.
---
Back in the day Wailing Caverns took like what, 60-90 minutes to complete? These days it takes like 20 minutes.
---
MC pugs will 100% be lead by The tank wanting the binding in the first place though. But I see your point.
---
It's the #nochanges [details] vs. #nochanges [feelings] conondrum...
---
I don't know what the answer is.
---
It is.
---
Or blizzard could simply change their policy on item re-assignment. Just put a blanket respons that: GMs will never intervene on mis-assigned loot. There done. Finished.
---
I'd rather have that than loot trading.
---
Well said.
---
If the click-report uses and automatic system, then people will report-bomb players out of spite for performing poorly or [Insert any random reason here]
---
If the report yields and *actual* GM ticken, then I'm all aboard.
---
How would you police that though? It would just yield more GM work in the end. The whole point of the system in the first place was to reduce GM work.
---
Like any automated system it can- and WILL be abused. And thus, it shouldnt be in classic.
---
If by "short" you mean "Literally a tenth of the dps"
---
The war effort still took 4 weeks on the biggest private vanilla server with a mega-population of NA, EU and CN players, and even that was a sped up opening.
---
Nobody is going to stockpile enough items to open the gates instantly.
---
If anyone thinks different then I have $100 to bet against that happening on ANY blizz classic server
---
The paladin funk mechanic was seal twisting, which took advantage of spell timing to get the benefits of 2 seals in a single swing. I don't really know much about it but it sounds incredibly impractical.
---
I agree. I'd rather have a zero tolerance policy. GMs wont help with any mis-assigned loot. Period. This would be ALOT better than having loot-trading.
---
I'm super stoked to have all of my dungeon and raid drops sold to me, thanks Loot Trading!
---
correct that theres no exp freezing in vanilla. theres really just a few things you need to do before hitting 19:
---
1) fully explore every zone you intend to gank unless you want to hang out in capitals all day. also consider exploring the zone after. even if you plan to hang out in redridge as a 19, theres still plenty of kills to be had in duskwood when you want to pursue higher targets. remember that youll get exp from the areas you explore on the way too. this will also let you get the flight paths sooner rather than later. dont forget about exploring STV arena and what not!
---
2) do every quest necessary as early as possible if it gives useful quest items - gravestone scepter is an important one to pay attention to, for example
---
3) bring stuff like murloc nets or magic dust if youre hunting someone in an area populated with mobs so that if the need arises, you can CC something and try to get out (or prevent a mob/elite from running you down if youre wounded)
---
take your time and do it right and youll stop like 40-50% through level 19 and never pick up a single point of exp for as long as you have the character
---
hell yeah man. Stitches is awesome.
---
Yea, seems like some people here think some of the more terrible dps specs are going to be viable when they're just not.
---
Fine. What about pug dungeons then? They will be ALOT more common. Infact, 99% of the dungeons ran will not be entirely guild-run.
---
That is the ideal and literally what has been said by CMs will happen, but people are paranoid that this doesn't happen to keep the system in check.  Although I'm not a doomcryer at all about this like many people here, I sort of can't blame them being paranoid.
---
It's better the bring a hunter to use nightfall anyway since wing clip can be spammed.
---
Ret is literally a non-viable meme spec.
---
It's going to be about half of a warrior or rogue's dos and get worse as gear scaling comes into play.
---
100% real. theres also some spots in game that have fairly weak beast mobs with spawn densities highly conducive to leveling. ideal single-target farm spots
---
Extremely simple and effective solution, really.
---
No

---
&gt;everyone will need roll on everything.
---
Nice try making your own opinion sound like it's a public one. Also thanks for making the same thread on the same topic the 9483th time. 
---
Also nice how "an amazing social experience game where you have fun and make friends" instantly turns into a game with only assholes whose only purpose is to ninja and then sell the loot.
---
I'm super stoked to never play with a group of friends of guild members because I'll have a lower chance of getting loot,
---
thanks loot trading!
---
Damn the memories.
---
So, I see you quite clearly did not read or comprehend my entire comment. I quite literally said *i know they will not answer loot tickets.* My comment had nothing to do with that and was purely talking about the business aspect you mentioned, I was entirely talking about the stupidity of rationalizing wasteful spending regardless of if you’re a 100k company in revenue, 11bn, Amazon levels or more. It’s unacceptable regardless of the size of the business, period. 
---
I have exactly as many reasons, I see gear, I need gear, I ninja gear. The system doesn’t matter. The players attitude is all that matters 
---
If by easy you mean like 300 stacks of runecloth donations... sure
---
If you find it that hard to tell them apart I hope you don't drive. 
---
Also it's not like they change order. 
---
I would understand Theramore, being an important place after the events from Warcraft III, but Stonard ?
---
It's not a siege of power for Orcs at the moment of WC3/Vanilla. Like all camps controlled by Thrall's Horde in southern EK it's used as a minor outpost to carry small operations. In the case of Stonard, investigating the Temple.
---
It's depicted in dialogues and quests as an abandoned place recently reinvested by an expedition.
---
This is why personal loot was invented, to stop loot trading from happening.
---
The Schematic for the Gnomish Cloaking Device (my favourite trinket, always make it while leveling!) had to be bought from a gnome under Ravenholdt. It's obscure and out of the way which makes it exciting to go and get it. This is a prime example for me as to why inconvenience is important in world building
---
When you say “these day” do you mean private servers? Because it still takes 90 minutes.
---
You're going to loose a lot of time mining, that might cost you your first place.  
---
I considered skinning at first, but 3s by 8000 mobs (16000 mobs of your lvl to kill while grinding to lvl 60, I counted half of them skinnable) it's more than 6 hours "lost".  
---
From vanilla memory (so take it with a grain of salt), I think tin veins are a bit sparse (a bit like wool) and by the time you encounter the next ones (iron I think) your mining lvl is not high enough so you have to run around for tin veins.  
---
Good luck.  
---
No just retail. I played recently and you can blast through WC, it certainly doesn’t take 90 minutes anymore in my experience, 20-30 usually.
---
I think a lot of people will quit if it takes 10 hours to get to level 2.
---
Heh, I'm the opposite with TBC and Wrath.  I so deeply regret not understanding back then how fast the TBC Collector's Edition would sell out.  Then again, I don't know if I had ever preordered something like that.  To be fair, WoW was a lot of firsts in the gaming world.
---
Because of that, I definitely knew what I was dealing with for Wrath's CE, so fortunately, I did get that one, but even though I thought I was prepared, it was still a scary struggle to find it.  Somehow, Best Buy of all places had many left.
---
I think you're severely underestimating the war effort.
---
1. Multiple accounts is multiple subscriptions (well in advance)
---
2. The amount of mats required is *insane.* Not that many players are willing to give up valuable materials when gold is extremely useful in Classic wow.
---
Loot trading will destroy pugging dungeons. 
---
Lol
---
So if a feature existed but you didn't like it then it didn't exist. That's some next level retail player logic.
---
I'd not join a guild using that system and I wouldn't expect the guild to last long. It has the downside of non-LC systems in that loot distribution isn't "optimal". It has the downside of non-LC/non-point systems of being completely unpredictable. It had the downside of a point-based or loot list system in that it requires a lot of administrative work and slows the raid down as well as requiring upkeep outside of the raids. It has the downside of roll-based systems that loot distribution is still mostly random. It has the downside of still opening you up to drama because you are "playing favorites" with the modifiers.
---
The only person profiting from this system is little timmy who joins a raid every couple of weeks because he can get all the items nobody wants and still get a chance at the high value items everyone wants. Any semi-competent and reliable player will lose in this system because that high value item that drops once every 6 weeks and is the only hole in his gear now has a chance to go to someone who just plainly does not deserve it.
---
If you want to just /roll on stuff, join a pug or run one yourself.
---
Looks good.
---
The fixed width layout on your site is quite annoying though. Even simply changing `width: 900px` to `max-width: 900px` under your `#main_site` style would be an improvement.

So here's my question: What do we replace these items with?
---
&gt; unless you're a kid with no manners. 
---
&gt; it was NEVER a problem 
---
You're contradicting yourself. 
---
It's a problem because you don't know people in PuGs so you will be playing with the kids you mentioned.
---
Can we please stop with these threads.  We are aware loot trading is a concern for some players (Not all).  We don't need 5 posts a week about it.
---
&gt; People who are going to be ninjas will just use master looter: It's more effective. In your scenario, you still have a 20% chance to win the staff vs 4 friends. With master looter, you have exactly 0%. 
---
&gt; Plenty of pugs use master looting. The ability to just swap to ML as a boss dies also exists. 
---
You're missing 2 main points. 
---
You're ignoring the fact that you don't know that X ITEM will drop until after the boss dies. Do you honestly think corrupt master loot ninjas are going to swap to ML right before every boss kill in every group for a chance at stealing a wanted item, with the contingency that it needs to drop?
---
Also, as many others have pointed out in other places, it's much easier to conceal or give more difficulty to suspect loot trading than it is to hide swapping to an alternate loot system when a boss dies that displays in chat. With friends that want to trade items, the pug will almost always be unable to prove the rollers aren't necessarily going to use the loot (examples include using older shitty gear to hide the fact they already have it, or claiming it for an alternate spec they don't intend to use), or suspect it in the first place.
---
The opportunity for thievery to occur will undeniably increase when the item itself has dropped and a mechanism exists that facilitates them being able to get away with the crime without appearing guilty...
---
It's similar to the example of people that steal physical goods in real life &amp; torrentors. The average person wouldn't steal something out in the open, with risks of cameras and witnesses, but given enough (online) anonymity even they will turn to becoming petty criminals.
---
&gt; Loot reserving is already an issue on private servers
---
It's not an issue because anyone can make their own group.
---
thanks for the input, will try it out!
---
3 hours no reply. It must've been you 
---
AFAIK these are all over Duskwood and Deadwind Pass
---
I think that might be the case currently on live, and if so that rule should carry over. (Or at least on BOE items, if you need role it's locked you can't trade it)
---
Searing Gorge is faction neutral.
---
I agree.  WoW's Group Finder is definitely totally fine and is basically TBC's Looking For Group tool: https://web.archive.org/web/20090807221227/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/lookingforgroup.html
---
Final Fantasy XIV's Party Finder is all but confirmed what WoW copied for its Group Finder.  There's nothing actually wrong with it, though I understand why diehards on this board would hate it.
---
That's why warriors should always save trinket for blind, if you trink cheapshot you're pretty much finished.
---
I lolled at this and not the usual lol like "it's funny so i'll write lol" but the actual "wife looking up , you having a stroke?" Kind of lol.
---
If resources is the issue, then the better overall solution is to not provide customer service for loot mistakes.
---
fixed it!
---
And Tirisfal glades and maybe some in Silverpine too(?)
---
Uhh nice gross simplification. Shitty people will come out and be "shitty" when there are inherent flaws in the system that permits their shitty tactics to not only be effective, but also go unnoticed or prove hard to convict.
---
Also, I can't even comprehend how you think misloots after plenty of ingame experience from level 1-60 can occur past the first couple times a piece of loot drops in group can occur more than the temptation of taking a path of least resistance to acquire loot and progress faster...
---
Wow...
---
That exceeded my expectations by a lightyear.
---
I thought of something like „retired from gaming and is now working as a Potter in his cabin in the woods“.
---
That‘s tragic.
---
And the fact that no one ever talks. You can do whole dungeon without anyone saying a single word. Like bots.
---
I love classic approach, but it's completely useless in retail because you group with people from different realms. It makes trying to improve your community completely pointless.
---
This might be the way OS runescape is going but I don't feel it's the right choice. It's just letting the loudest people dictate things. I feel OSRS will soon just become RS 2.
---
There's big issues with this for me:
---
1: I don't believe players are better then educated and  experianced devs. Given the choice in TBC, well over the required % would've chosen to add flying too.
---
2: Too many cooks and Echo chambers are rife on the internet. If you give game design power to a mob, they'll never finish unless the echo chamber gets strong enough. Look at how much good forward progress was made on TwitchplaysPokemon in the first week vs the rest of it.
---
3: Vocal Minority. The players we see and talk with are the minority. Just the same as those who would vote on such a thing. Many players would only feel the effects of this new and different dev team and we'd likely end up with a smaller playerbase over time, just like live wow.
---
In the end I understand the feeling of "We should start again, and we could design it better" but doing things for 75% of the vocal minority would most likely give us Vanilla servers with all the changes we fought against when Classic was announced. And sure, just like OSRS, that might end up being better than the live version, but it will be a far cry from what Classics true future could be imo.
---
The Dev team on classic has so far proven they are willing to listen and work with us. If this style continues, I believe this type of relationship where we work together is the best for our games future.
---

chain has a cooldown, lightning bolt takes longer to cast.
---
How about a shaman named paladin ?
---
Haha, I still completely remember the outrage in FFXI over most jobs being unable to do anything solo after Level 10 or so.  Having come from Korean MMORPGs like Ragnarok Online first and Lineage II, that was absolutely absurd to me and what felt like most people back then.  I agree it's a noble but ultimately shitty idea.
---
I like the idea of Support classes, but they can't be just about passives or else that person isn't actually playing.  It's not a mystery to me why WoW was developed over time the way it was.  My only gripe with it has been the raiding difficulty spike in Cataclysm suddenly shutting out so many people.
---
1) That is the most obvious example...if only everything that dropped and people rolled on was. There are many more examples that aren't so explicitly black and white wrong such as multiple casters rolling for each other, or dps for weapons, or necks/capes/rings that can arguably be good for a majority of the group but subject to being passed around.
---
2) Oh yes let's support the system because we're going to assume it's going to happen in one isolated incident to one person on one piece of loot. Do you see the flaw in this logic? Let's see how you fare too when you hunt for your BiS piece and run 20 runs to not have it drop or to lose the roll, only for it to continue to happen because of potential loot trading in the instances where you should've won and moved on to other things.
---
3) This is one of the only plausible points but even then, convenience will enable would-be ninjas to come out and act unethically. Most people wouldn't consider ticketing for an item unless it was extremely rare, and even then have to fill it out in the first place, and have both parties act on it, and be tolerant to the waiting game that came with a 4 day turnaround response. With all that hassle to, who is to say GM's wouldn't start ignoring their requests when it became a pattern or trend?
---
So it did have BoP loot trading but you think it should be changed, because you think only "whiney little kids" used it. Very coherent argument.
---
thank god it doesn't 
---
This is a very nice post. Putting this here to watch the video when I need a few more quests to do!
---
I totally understand what you're saying, but just to provide the counterargument to this, and one I sympathize some (but not completely) with, is that an MMO is just a glorified chatroom if the gameplay is so simple that it lets you talk all day, and then it's hard to call it a game.
---
I absolutely remember that criticism about Ragnarok Online back then, and I read it about MMORPGs in general.  While I hated it back then, now I really do see what they were saying.
---
Yeah true, it's a double edged sword.
---
Was going to comment this here. For a perfect example, look up 'Ioneye Shaman' on google.
---
It was really big problem in lfr dragonsoul
---
In for a bad time because the values are going to be different? Why? You just said exactly what I said good job.
---
Oh. The more you know 
---
Didn't know that but that wasn't my point :)
---
I want to be on the side of the humans this time around.
---
Although, I don't know if I'll be able to pass up OG ORG.
---
Still a problem if the master looter is with friend/guildies. That would mean that friends could still roll for item they don't need for their other friend, master loot give it to the one who win. Then after everyone left the raid, friend give it to the masterlooter who then give it to the other friend. Guild hosted pug will be able to do this.
---
The problem isnt that the master looter must be complicit but that the information of the ninja happening can be hidden with simples tricks.
---
If the master looter want to ninja, that's fine but it must be visible to everyone.
---
one day we were all new players and we had fun no matter the race, class, or faction.  play whatever the fuck you think is cool.
---
whats the addon that compares the item stats?
---
\&gt;Without the good items being reserved?
---
"LFM MC, all good items that might be useful to you reserved. You can roll on items that no one including you need."
---
Who will want to join this seriously ? Usually the only thing that are reserved are the bindings and the reagents.
---
When I first started, I was on a Satellite modem and it had like a 700 ping, so I would study the dungeons and time everything before it happened...when I finally got a good connection, it was no longer a challenge and I could dance around any player...I am sure in the beginning, I was definitely considered incompetent. But determination won.
---
Guess you learn something new everyday about WoW, lol
---
Cool easter egg kinda thingy
---
Is it worthwhile around level 58 to stop questing and start running dungeons for pre-raid bis? Are the xp rates any good?
---
The best pro tip is to put in a ticket and get the name you want, if they're inactive
---
So many quests haunt us with questions like that
---
I only started playing WoW about 7 months ago but I'm looking forward to playing Classic because I'd like to explore pre-cata Azeroth.
---
In BfA I mainly play Warlock, I was wondering whether Warlock will be a fun/doable class to play if I'm not willing to farm soul shards?
---
You are seriously dense if you don't understand why they took it from the GM ticket system to the trade window. The answer is obvious: it was routinely used, rarely abused and always approved given the right circumstances.
---
Do we know if RP servers are confirmed with Classic yet? Getting mixed messages.
---
Hopefully this mentality can be maintained once again &amp; not turn classic into retail raid finder...
---
They'll implement it without the ability to roll need on things your class doesn't want, no?
---
I want what you're smoking man. That was a pandaren casting power word shield in the end of the video. Fear ward is not even in the game anymore.
---
1. I was replying to OP. If you want to lay out a new scenario we can discuss that. I’m not sure where the ambiguity is, is it a caster ring/necklace or a melee DPS cloak. I think you need to be more specific in your examples. Also, for this to work remember that people need to be carrying around an entire set of trash gear or else their ninja practices will be caught. I frankly don’t find that likely. 
---
2. Once again, I was replying to OP. OP was laying out a case for a level 20 staff. I find it extremely unlikely that it is BiS for any practical purposes (including 29 twinking). Now if you want to discuss level 60 pre-raid BiS items we can. Remember that these other people need to be carrying trash pieces of that given gear. Also one is likely to be an idiot for being in a group with some many people rolling on a specific piece of loot. While I concede that level pre-raid BiS gear might be the one niche case where the scenario could *potentially* arise, it can be avoided by 1) running dungeons with diverse groups (don’t run a 5-man with 4 casters and be expecting to get the pre-raid BiS caster ring. Just find a different group) and 2) if one gets to 60 and can’t form the better part of a reputable group of friends and guildies then I think one should evaluate why that is. If this is done, it is at most a very isolated incident. 
---
3. Yes I think ninjas are more than patient enough to wait a few days. If this continues to happen to an account/s it leaves a pretty obvious paper trail for banning. GMS could see that players X, Y and Z are 8 standard deviations above the norm for loot tickets. Also ticketing to exchange items was an enormous hassle for Blizzard as said by them, it was not “extremely rare”.
---
No loot trading at all and a few GMs to handle misassignment requests from time to time, strictly limited to 40 man raids. We will pay a monthly subscription so we can expect a certain SLA!
---
This moderation is low effort.
---
A night elf in their level 20s helped me in Elwynn Forest when they didn’t have to and I didn’t ask. They then gave me a six slot bag. I will always remember them even though it was just 15minutes many years ago.
---
Little interactions matter.
---
If you're talking about absolute BiS, then the absolute ideal for every class is to have Engineering for PvE, for sappers and dynamite, and chicken and dragonling.
---
The highest end hardcore Vanilla guilds like progress all have Engineering on every single member in the raid for this reason.
---
Less than absolute hardcore raids can be more lenient with only melees and mages having engineering.
---
Blizzard could just bluff the community and say "it's changing" but only change one tiny thing, like the amount of iron bars required to turn in. It would work!
---
makes world bosses a hell of a lot more fun, cant iimagine people on a pve server just watching the other faction kill azuregos or something and you just gotta sit there and watch. lmao pve servers were a mistake
---
good friendships can be made because of world pvp like this tbh.
---
When weather effects used to happen randomly in different zones instead of specific ones now 
---
I played for 2-3 months on pserver, leveled UD warlock to 51lv.
---
I had ton of fun leveling - lots of utilities, pet management, dots and fears, ability to easily kill 2-3 mobs with higher or same level as you, exchanging mana for health, draining... its a hell of a good ride.
---
That said, for the time i play, i think i did not farm SS, ever.
---
Soul drain which improve your mana regen is helpful, so SS were landing in my shard bag during leveling very often.
---
You get a Trinket from a quest in 50s which allows you to summon VW without SS
---
Cant speak for Raids tho. Even in dungeons you will often be called to summon ppl. With 2-3 ppl its fine, with 20...
---
that, actually sounds pretty fucking cool haha
---
He just explained to you what it "encourages". You obviosuly dont get it and you act like an asshole.
---
Stop it spammer 
---
Yeah pretty much this. If it took an 11k pop server 4 weeks to open it, with most of the 60s at the time already knowing of the AQ requirements, 
---
And,
---
On &lt;Another high pop server that is currently running&gt;, War effort began on 9th of Jan and was opened on 2nd of February. Bearing in mind they sped up the war effort because of their new timeline to coincide with classics release. And the usual pop was like 8k on &lt;high pop server&gt;, both world wide servers.
---
I think it's going to take a bit longer than a month on classic, with servers that are a quarter of the population and half the time they will be sleeping/working w/e.
---
Chill bro
---
I even just added mana generation from felhunter to the sheet and you go in a full bis situation from 1.7k DPS with succ to 1.5k with fellhunter.   
---
Its good for a 5.8k mana gen in a 2 min fight, meaning you don't need to LT anymore.  
---
In the succ sitation you gain about 5.3k mana from LT 3 times.  
---
I went up to 5 mins and the results are the simular also went to 10 min and once more succ beats doggo.
---
Back in Vanilla I was farming SM.
---
It's advice like this that is the distinct reason why I had macros for every single dungeon, quest, encounter, and raid, on my hotbars.
---
All the way from Blackfathom Deeps, to Ahn'Qiraj 40man. The second we zoned in, I did an AFK check when we got to each boss, and spazzed the macro, gave them a minute to absorb, and then engaged.
---
Say what you want, but it was RIDICULOUSLY helpful. And it mitigated a LOT of inexperienced behavior people had little tolerance for. Plus, I felt useful. So I was happy to do it.
---
When weather effects used to happen randomly in different zones instead of specific ones now
---
It was great having rainfall, sandstorms and snowfall and nights that actually looked like night 
---
**THE SKY IS FALLING AHHH**
---
Agreed, the voting would be bad. Blizzard on record has stated they regret adding flying (and tried to remove it in WOD but community went insane), regret adding arenas (Rob Pardo interview), regret adding LFG (said it made the world smaller), regret adding portals everywhere (removed portals in recent BFA patch), and many more.
---
From what I understand with OSRS, the most heavily debated features (which are still accepted by the majority) are the Grand Exchange and the Clan Wars system.
---
If we compare these to WoW, the auction house already exists (GE) and arena wouldn't be added (Clan Wars) as they regretted it the first time. I don't have a fear of a slippery slope that these nochangers have.
---
mage "why" and a hunter "what"
---
Why is the mage., 
---
why is the mage, what?
---
No, what is the hunter.
---
WoW always had a lot of weird little details and rumors off the top of my head I remember, the goldshire kids supposedly summoning a portal, there being a secret quests like the naga at the coast and at the time there was obviously the ghost quest in brd and the spirit healer memorial in the barrens so it gave these little rumors a pinch of credence, heck for some reason I remember being told to salute a guard in stormwind and when it saluted back I was convinced it was all real.
---
That /chicken quest though was the work of a sociopath, it's like putting ONE secret wall in your game pointing at it and loudly stating "Gee I wonder if there are more secrets like this, isn't it cool that they can react like that!" 
---
*Then again it does mean that there is a slight possibility of people finding new stuff in classic*
---
If you are going single target build than +dmg is useful, for aoe grinding though it's useless because you need as much mana and stam as you can get to be sure you kill the pull and also blizzard doesn't benefit much from +dmg
---
When it comes to high end raiding, world buffs play a huge role in vanilla. PvP servers are fun, but PvE servers provide a much better environment for guilds to buff up before raids. Its almost certain the best PvE guilds will play on PvE servers for that reason. So that's always something to take into consideration. 
---
Anyone arguing against this post in any way is a mindless filthy casual player of the current game, or a soulless devil internet troll. 
---
Most people forget how badly Naxxramas gear destroyed PvP. It absolutely should be nerfed down the line. 
---
What should be added in future content is more build diversity - there are many, many awesome items in Vanilla that end up weak, but have awesome effects. Future content should focus on sidegrades and introducing new stats on items.
---
Example of existing items that are nearly rendered useless later in the game (especially when Naxx gear is out)
---
Hand of Edward the Odd's instant cast
---
Serenity's chance-on-hit dispel
---
Stronghold Gauntlet's disarm immunity
---
Black Grasp of the Destroyer's mana steal
---
Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire's skeleton
---
And many more.
---
Makes sense, but it's wrong to the spirit of Vanilla. 
---
Quite the conundrum
---
Thanks a lot! Saved this 
---
Yea that was a pretty unfortunate auto correct to mean the exact opposite of what I wanted to say - you can screenshot a ninja loot, but you have no way to see what other players trade. 
---
Loot works completely differently in vanilla, paladins might want cloth items and warriors might want leather.
---
Raiding, you will be expected to turn up with a bunch of shards farmed. Anything lower than that, you only really need to keep a few on you for summons, and you can do ok just making more as you go. 
---
If you want to do pvp at a high level you’ll need to farm shards. 
---
good luck making the raid leader understand why you couldnt farm money for your potions and shit
---
My 12 year old self leveled many night elves, but I distinctly remember seeing the glowing trees growing in Teldrassil and wondering about their significance. On NE#6 I finally fought my way to the tree in the Oracle Glade to find that it offered a quest. I was ecstatic! I did those two quests on the following 500 NE I would make.
---
Not off the top of my head, googlefu is your best bet. Try youtube first maybe as it's blowing up with wow content atm.
---
Stop pretending, it isn't funny and I gave you attention already.
---
Okay let me rephrase then. I've never heard of any bank drama from any half decent guild, even the shitty ones that cant clear content. I've only ever seen people ninja the bank after a guild has died, or people who join the guild specifically to fuck that guild over (which to me is different than what was described above - corruption from the officers/guild leaders)
---
Try out different chunk size (2-3 works best for my night elf characters) and number of retries settings (again, 10 for me) and see what gives you the best result. Also set number of names to 200 :)
---
Xp rates are not very good, unless you can do a bunch of quests at the same time. If you can find a group as a dps at sub 60 I’d go. 100% would t touch it as a tank, nor a non-priest healer unless you’ve got some decent gear already and you know what you’re doing 
---
Im kinda bummed that the gear UI stil shows the priest in starter items
---
Hehe I'm sorry to hear that ;) will take a look at it
---
When was the last time you were in ZQ? Drops shit ton of BOE's, so you set your addon to NEED everything BOE. It can be traded anyway if someone needs it.
---
Impossible to tell but theoretically what would give me the best chances;   
---
Taking vacay to push hard upon release to get ahead of the pack and breeze through the content after the first two zones.  
---
Taking vacay a week later in hopes that release will be a clusterfuck of disconnections, delays, server crashes and overpopulated zones. Run into the pack after a few days since I push hard.
---
These are in Tirisfal Glades also, in random bushes.
---
Kinda tried to make it neutral. To be honest, i dont care one way or another. Heck, LT might even be better for me, as i enjoy running dungeons and do it for money, ofc i can only sell anything that i win on greed roll.
---
Western
---
Mhm, I recall those fondly.  Love little details like this.  Wow's got a superb abundance of neat little things I like in the game.  Some more obvious, some less.
---
As a healer it’s my “favourite” thing seeing DPS-es randomly pull stuff they shouldn’t
---
New graphics, yes.  Models, No.
---
idk if blizzard has the humility to admit that some of their design philosophies are incorrect.
---
Look at the rack on that thing  
---
They've already said that the design philosophy from classic is and has to be different from that of retail
---
Use Retail's specs, they'll be roughly the same and you can get a cheap enough laptop to meet that requirement.  
---
Taking both weeks off :D
---
What lesser known levelling tips do people think are important? I'm gonna go warlock, probably undead as I can't stand orc animations 
---
Hoping to be one of the first to 60? Take the first week off and get way ahead. Hoping to get the most enjoyment out of your vacation? Wait a week.
---
Thanks, I already got my fantasy character name for WoW though.  
---
Leetmemez is ready to adventure through Azeroth!  
---
Youtube should have more content like this. If this was any other creator, this movie would have been 30 minutes
---
Makes me sad 
---
I zone in as the tank,  say hello, and say how’s it going everyone?
---
DPS just starts pulling. The healer may emote a :)
---
Then no one talks.
---
I continue to try and put in comments here and there. Mention when I’m going to LoS, or what mob to focus (especially if it’s time walking).
---
*crickets* 
---
Gets to the last boss, gets a drop I don’t need of course, and 3 PMs, ‘u need? I need.’
---
The Goldshire kids thing was huge, I remember when the video about that guy going in the small house with the kids forming a pentagram along with the C'Thun voice came out. I used to check the forum every evening after comming back from school, so many theories, so many dark rumors, it was fantastic.
---
No.
---
I will happily donate my materials, that I farmed, to the auction house where the top guilds can purchase them so they can have their title.
---
It runs on the Legion 7.3.5 client so required specs will be mostly the same as in [Legion.](https://www.geforce.com/games-applications/pc-games/world-of-warcraft-legion/system-requirements)
---
How did BoP loot trading start in World of Warcraft?
---
It will use the current WoW client, so the requirements will be about the same. There is an option to load the old textures however, that might help with performance. I'd recommend a laptop with at least a GTX 1050 Ti, which comes in at around $800. Like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08VHrFaVnzA).
---
There's no real upper limit, even desktops will struggle to keep framerates high during raids. A GTX 1070 or 1080 is what I'd get at the most. There is also the RTX 2080 but it's extremely expensive and not worth the money unless you have too much of it. We're talking $2k+ here.
---
Hey those maiden's anguish or whatever aren't cheap!
---
Specifically for warlocks, getting a good wand will increase leveling speed by quite a bit. Just dot everything and wand them down.
---
There is no business aspect, it was made up and satirical.  There is no wasteful spending.  There are no imaginary GMs answering non existent loot tickets for any made up amount of money.
---
If an imaginary scenario where spending made up amounts of money on nonexistent things got your riled up then I'm sorry.  Lol
---
I wasn't trying to troll you, you just missed my sarcasm or something.
---
I saw the dungeon/raid release schedule but does this mean talents will follow this schedule as well?  I was interested in playing a feral Druid but my understanding is that a later patch gave them significantly more armor which is what made them a semi viable tank.

What do you guys think if they started using these old commercials to generate some buzz for Classic WoW! I think this would be a brilliant idea, it wouldn’t cost anything in production (they may need to pay the actors or buy the commercial slot obviously) but I think the cost would be low. These nostalgic commercials I think would be a smart business move and be a welcomed move by the community. Thoughts!?? Happy Sunday. 
---
&gt; you could just buy mats (realistically, you could also buy potions so...).
---
Like I said...
---
Your best bet might be to play with EU players if you cannot find a weekend only raiding guild.
---
Jalinda is awesome lol
---
Redgrinder is the only name I'd use.

---
How is my argument in bad faith compared to those who straight up lie and claim loot trading didn't exist in vanilla?
---
They're still great.  I'd love to see the return of William Shatner.  Lol
---
Omg. Thank you! I totally forgot about this gem. 
---
“Stay away from Darnassus for a while. 
---
I'll definitely bet you 100 bucks that atleast *one* server is gonna finish it incredibly fast. World First AQ clear will depend on it.
---
I always loved the idea of world pvp.... but it really wasn’t what everyone told me it would be. 10% of the time it was fun and you fought someone your level. 90% of the rest of pvp was getting murdered by those high lvl trolls that just like to kill low levels for hours. Doing BG was a much better option for me.
---
You underestimate recent innovations in chair technology, I’m confident my legs decay before I’d notice 
---
Just a small nitpick: there won't be "an option to load old textures". There will only be old textures.
---
Also, although raids are more taxing, they are still nothing compared to current WoW. Most likely the machine you linked will be enough to run the game flawlessly everywhere.
---
I've got some bad news... 
---
I like the core message but this is pretty cringe
---
1. New redditor? here, sorry didn't realize those replies were to OP and thought you meant from a general point of view. I was just giving examples of certain categories of items that are likely to he usable upgrades for more classes than just the armor type, that's all. While theoretically hardcore abusers could keep an entire trash set of gear in their bags, it mainly could get swapped out for pieces in their bank depending on the instance being ran and what they/their accomplices were seeking. Also pieces that could be deemed sidegrades could be all the justification they need to argue they are needing it for themselves.
---
2. Yeah, I meant the pre-raid BiS list mainly. While I don't expect most people to intentionally surround themselves with many others seeking the same items, you're still likely to be at competition with 1-2 others in many cases. Of course developing bonds and running with friends and guildies is important; it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing kinship or pug perspective, but sometimes waiting for the right guild is important around the time you hit 60, and sometimes friends are not online and/or busy doing other things. I could see myself realistically pugging in at least half of the time, if not more. How isolated it is remains to be seen, but with higher stakes/item rarity, there's a greater chance with it just from existing.
---
3. Yes ninjas will wait for the really "high-ticket" items. For leveling gear, being able to loot trade conveniences them to progress quicker at very little effort and more importantly, the instant effect. Whereas waiting multiple days would detract from their desire to absolutely acquire said item, especially if they were leveling fast. The point about GMS seeing a higher frequency of tickets from specific players only reinforces why some action could be taken on their end so those players don't continue to be able to act this way. Manual trading doesn't leave the paper trail, or at least one they would be more likely to act on. Also, do you happen to have a source about blizzard's comment on exchanging items thru tickets? I'm curious. I wouldn't imagine it would be too taxing to just approve a swap by identifying players in a small statement and validating player id's and instance id, unless there was much more nuance than that. But arguing in favor of more automation does save the company money, so I also wouldn't be surprised for them to make that statement anyway. It'd be a relative skeleton-crew maintained game compared to it's former standard.

---
Something with an SSD should be fine.
---
It's not "confirmed" but they will without a doubt have RP and RP-PvP servers.
---
Are you sure? I remember reading that there will be the newer HD textures (from Wrath I think?). They're the same, just higher quality.
---
And raids, well, there are a lot less effects but a lot more players. I would not expect them to run any better.
---
Sleep ? What is this thing you speak of ?
---
I don‘t think there is information on this topic but I highly doubt that they will change the talents over time. They changed the talents to balance the classes, it would be stupid to start with worse talents for the sake of „talent progression“ and I really hope they won‘t do it and just start with the 1.12 talents and keep them (my opinion).
---
But aside from what I think I just don‘t believe they would do that anyways. 
---
I'm sure. They are painstakingly recreating the game. They are using 1.12 data (including all the textures, models, etc.).
---
The only "updated graphics" will be what the engine provides, including water and shadows. (These will be optional, though.)
---
Well first of all the bet was "open the gates instantly" and you're offering to bet on "incredibly fast"
---
It depends what your definition of "incredibly" and "blazingly" fast means.
---
It also depends what the server capacity of the Blizz servers is like, if they're still 3000-4000 population then there's zero chance of them being open after 1 week
---
Totally agree. I think a lot of tech companies claim to be unable to do basic customer service because of "high volume" when lower profit margin industries have vastly more customer service interaction.
---
This might actually be a sort-of-maybe-acceptable compromise.
---
That being said, I still vote no loot-trading at all.
---
I remember back in the days of vanilla if i went onto a sevrer that was not my main, it felt like a new world and everyone was just different 
---
I guess this died as server transfers became more common but I will never forget the other wordly feeling young me felt when i went into a server that wasn't my main 
---
Thank you for that! Other than Engineering, there’s no other professions useful for raiding?
---
Bad behavior in this game is almost entirely the result for the desire of being "optimal"
---
If you are constantly obsessing over "BiS", "optimal set up", "optimal rotation" then chances are high that you no longer see this as a game, but rather as a task to be performed. Everything is fine, until these people fail, then everything gets sour and the game suffers for it.
---
There is nothing wrong with wanting to be good at games, but its also simultaneously a trap, because that is where hate for the game and hate for its players is most likely to come from.
---
&gt; You are a rogue and have been running UBRS daily for 2 weeks for dal'rend and so far you only have the off hand, you join a group with a fury warrior and another rogue.
---
That was a pretty dumb move. Why join a group where a minimum of four other people might want the one thing you want?
---
But also, UBRS is literally the only place where you can concoct a scenario like this where trading Need-rolled gear even matters. You're never going to be a rogue joining a 5-toon group with two other rogues and fury warrior, and if you do then you all deserve what you get.
---
And since Blizzard almost certainly won't allow trading Need-rolled items, just Greed-rolled, all of this pantswetting is over nothing.
---
&gt;Unless you're suggesting that people are going to bother keeping around sets of terribad gear to gimp their performance in dungeons to appear that they actually need this loot to trade it to their friend...
---
Not only did this ACTUALLY happen, it's not the only reason as well.
---
I looked it up and there doesn't seem to be an official statement in either direction. The old textures will be there, but the new one's might also be available: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b0yo3l/modelsanimations_toggle_option_ever_been/eiiahta
---
Are there any scenarios where mages want plate?
---
When was the last time you were in ZQ on a classic blizzard server?
---
@topic: yes, that's a scenario that -could- happen.
---
Engineering is the absolute king profession when it comes to raiding.
---
For mages and warlocks, tailoring 300 simply and only for the set bonus for Bloodvine set. Bloodvine isn't replaced until tier 3 for warlocks. During tier 1 mages, priests, and warlocks can also get the BoP robe recipe which is great preraid and better than tier 1, but you don't have to keep tailoring for that. It's not absolutely crucial, though, since it can be replaced, but the utility of engineering can never be replaced.
---
Especially for tanks, sappers help keep AoE aggro. Chicken and dragonling increase raid dps. The amount of increase in raid dps because of engineering simply cannot be understated.
---
Main tanks may want to go blacksmithing for [[Glimmering Mithril Insignia]](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10418), but that's less important for Alliance raiding.
---
Basically, Engineering is the only real absolute big contributor to raids. Every other profession can be on alts or simple money makers like herbalism.
---
Refusing to acknowledge that loot trading is a NEW "mechanism" doesn't make your point valid.  It makes you uninformed.
---
This was awesome hahaha
---
MN is pretty good in my opinion, but Esfand ? Are you going to call Tipsoutbaby a legend next 
---
Haha, exactly, though in this case I suspect the nochanges crowd would push for a change in the details to maintain the spirit.
---
Like much of the minutia though, I don’t care either way. 
---
Indeed. I recently went back to try out the new expansion and there were 49+ people in Vol'dun and I was there for a few hours doing the quests and...not one person spoke. I posted twice in general chat, one looking for a quest group and the second wondering if anyone else thought the scaling at 120 was pretty rough. Nope, nothing. What's even the point of playing then? Trade chat is only full of people selling boosts at an industrial scale too, it's just sad man.
---
Is... is that legal?
---
On private servers there are no level restrictions on enchants. Which means yeah twinking gets pretty silly. I think level requirements came in tbc. 
---
That's really old hat. At the Blizzcon presentation they stressed that they'll strive for as authentic experience as possible, down to correcting individual lamp post colors. They also explained that the old data and the old code to handle that data (particularly animations) is inextricably intertwined. Which means that there is no easy "switch" to just drop in updated anything.
---
They *might* work on adding in optional asset updates from current WoW but it'll be additional, tricky work. I seriously doubt they would delay the release for it. (And I wouldn't hold my breath for them adding it anytime in the future.)
---
That being said, LFD / LFR really isn't the focus of the game. Modern wow is all about having a small dedicated dungeon group trying to push your keys as high as possible, or raiding with the same people on heroic / mythic difficulty every week. I've quit retail willingly for the first time since in 13 years (have had times when I was forced to stop for other reasons), but the situation really isn't as bad as people claim it is.

---
If anyone knows some of this won't be available in phase 1 please let me know. 
---
I don't think there was a level requirement for enchants at any time during vanilla.
---
At least, I don't remember one.
---
Lifetap plus cannibalize is very handy for leveling. 
---
No crack pipe listed... I hope it is
---
Yes guards, this Paladin right here

try meme producer, on app store.

I love those! Made 9yr old me extra scared of Duskwood! I’m pretty sure they removed these later on...

Wand gets crit from agility.

I remember being a kid and being obsessed with the ocean. I loved the YouTube videos with the X files music as they hunted Nessie in the tram or the Loch.
---
Yo. Sup?
---
Free buffs for all strangers is definitely a nice gesture. (:
---
Nano made a private server 3 years ago btw. Lots of things changed.
---
almost everyone uses LC what are you talking about.
---
You can thank last night's drunk self, haha. :D Glad you enjoyed the post though. Best of luck. \^\^
---
Unfortunately Paladins cannot dual wield. You'll usually want a shield in the offhand as holy.
---
Very true. (:
---
This... also, will you be able to use classic wow gold to buy game time? If so, people will be really eager to sell mats more than hoard.
---
Enchants requiring a min ilvl came in wrath didnt it?
---
I knwo this post i quite old but that do not make it less important!
---
I am also torn.
---
I do not think changing the game itself in form of new content or major itemization changes would be a good idea because the community worked for that classic experience to have the same or pretty close to same game it was back then (Lore, RP, Challenge(PVP/PVE), Exploring and just enjoying Azeroth to its fullest in every thinkable way). That is also what my wish would be.
---
BUT... I think class balancing was always part of the game, there have been several changes in the game to prevent abuses and extreme domination of classes already back then so why should a balancing not be implemented. I understand noone wants to see his fav class to lose some strenghts (PvP/Raiding/Leveling) and therefore i would be very careful with nerving classes. I would rather want to see some (PVE) buffs or bufflike changes to some specs. Naming them i would probably say Feral Druid, Prot/Ret Pally, Ele, Moonkin, Smite priests. (I'm sure i forgot about one or two)
---
These changes should only have an effect in Raid environment and not PVP (Shadows, Rets, Moonkin, Ele these are all pretty strong in PVP). A general buff would completely destroy the PVP. But improving the ability to raid in different specs would lead to more diversity and more fun and that is what vanilla is about is it not? Diversity and freedom.
---
Why do i think so:
---
I invested 100+ hours of theorycrafting into making elemental shaman viable in a raiding environment just to see that in the beginning you find an unavoidable giant manahole to fill whereas in the end when you maybe are able to solve that mana problem the damage multiplier is just not high enough to compete with fire/shadow. (Compare: Shadow/Fire x1,6 vs. nature (Ele), arcane (Moonkin), Holy (Ret/Smite priest) x1,05 - 1,25). These specs just get outscaled.
---
How do I think could these changes look like, because many will be sceptic about how can a buff not affect PVP.
---
Reducing manacost of specific spells via Items in the beginning Raids (MC,ZG,BWL) by craftable pieces -&gt; when later raids come out the part get outscaled for PVP anyways and the manapool to work with increases and in PVP Burst is much more important than mana sustain over 4+minutes
---
\-&gt; careful not to put the best stats for pvp (no stamina, no crit etc...)
---
\- Option one: similar sets to the bloodvine set in leather/mail/Plate requiring leatherworking/Blacksmithing which decrease mana cost of lightningbolt/Starfire.... (to have in impact in PVE they should be avaivable at MC already so maybe option 2 would be better)
---
\- Option two: Item which are BoP like Robe of the Archmage but for Leatherworkers (Druid/Shaman) and Blacksmithers (Paladins) - positive side effect it would dramatically revive dead professions such as elemental leatherworking!!! No one would use that now (Win Win for RP'ers, Raiders, Collectors....)
---
\-&gt; Maybe 10% mana cost off for a specific spell (e.g. lightning bolt/Starfire/smite) - Mana still needs to be challenging to those specs but there are already creative ways to deal with it!!
---
\-&gt; changing of skill trees and manacost in general would have a much higher effect in pvp because the items would be replaced whereas the skills/manacost reduction is not!
---
\-&gt; other classes still have their setbonuses which Eles/Moonkins can forget so for all the haters, you still have advantages (also the spellbooks of AQ which augment spell base damage, glove enchants/ Shadow/firepower potions) and i would be totally fine with it to deal some less dps but it has to be playable without downranking 3 Ranks! An without only mages, warriors, Rouge in raids doing dmg - noone can tell me that this is somehow more funny than mixing up with mookins/Smite priests and so on.
---
2. higher the spelldamage multiplier for nature/arcane/holy in lategame coming with AQ or ZG
---
\-&gt; how to reduce impact on pvp (I know ele and moonkin deal already a lot in PVP) - do not make it own spells, implement it in debuffs and buffs from other classes
---
\-&gt; Curse of the Elements could give 10% naturedmg (which actually would be logic and would fit into the lore)
---
\-&gt; in case of Ele shaman make that enhancement Stormstrike not 2 stacks instead maybe 10 sec duration so that the debuff become valuable and can be used (otherwise with Darkmoon: Maelstrom, Thunderfury, Poison these stacks are faster used than the Shaman can use a spell lowering the spelldmg multiplyer to x1.05)
---
\-&gt; there could be an groupwide aura of priest which could maybe be called ..X... of gods (at least nature and holy are godly spellschools to keep the RP element and to fit into the lore) +10% nature/holy/arcane which lowers the impact of it in PVP because there has to be a holy priest or sth similar around those classes (a totem or pala aura would be too strong for pvp with the selfbuff)
---
(3. make Moonkins able to cast innervate in form ffs :P, give that damn paladin a taunt)
---
So the Mainissue would be: do not nerv classe because the community would get angry. But who could get angry when implementing recipes to profession which acutally would give these professions a meaning again from which nearly 50% of the classes would benefit and which would lead to maybe more diverse meele/caster groups. Even the now dominating classes would benefit because they would have less competition on valueble items (Weapons etc. #Ironfoeruns in BRD)
---
All these ideas promiss to not change any class identity and have minor to zero impact in pvp, they just make PVE possible for many classes without changing skills/rotation or lore/RP elements.
---
Please give me feedback on my thoughts!

---
There ya go.  
---
But gnome paladins don't exist 🤔
---
Yep. He's either insane or just another scammer.
---
You can use all enchants in vanilla
---
I never said it's the focus of the game. But a new player is going there before he's going into normal raids or mythic+ and pick up his attitude there. And that attitude spreads. And now a huge majority of pugs are only willing to deal with people who are overqualified because it's all about finishing as quickly as possible, it's not about community, recruiting players is basically recruiting the most fitting A.I.
---
I would certainly replace it, but that doesn't mean all has to change.  A good mix with items from this list and new ones.
---
Keep the cloth bandages.  Just mix up the amounts between horde and alliance a bit.  
---
Keep some of the metal and leathers, but spice it up a bit and require smaller amounts of gold and truesilver etc as well.  The same goes for other materials, throw in some Hides, Gems, etc.  
---
Now for really new things:
---
- Pick a skill 100 and a skill 250  item from each profession and require 1000 of those.   Anything goes, bonus points for the design if it has some war theme.  Copper bombs, Deadly Scopes for the engineers. 
---
-  Tailors provide some bags, blacksmiths and leatherworkers provide armor etc.    The amount of raw materials that is needed for these will have to be taken in consideration of course, when the numbers for the raw materials are set.   
---
- For Fish, we can just change it up and target some other fish, so nobody can fish up a thousand  Rainbow Fin Albacore in advance.  
---
- Same goes for cooking.  
---
- To round it up , add about 10 random white and grey loot drops from monsters that are spread all over the world.  Make a story why the war effort needs 500 [Broken Weapon]  Recycling etc and off you go.  These Junk items  should be selected from mobs that are found in greater numbers, in all corners of the world, so the players that want to track down these can spread out.  
---
Deadwind Pass always scared the hell out of me. I'd just ride through it as quickly as possible whenever I needed to go to Swamp of Sorrows for the first time. There was something about that place that just felt wrong; the very fact that there were no quests there just seemed to add to the overall feeling of **stay away**. 
---
Thank you for reminding me of that shitshow. Holy crap what a mess it was!
---
Paladins can use Offhand Caster Items though, and often they have better caster/healer stats than shields. Thaurissan's Royal Scepter is an offhand, not a mace, even though it looks macey.
---
How hard is it to get the nelf mount as a human? I'm thinking about the 40 one but an answer for 60 is good too
---
Indeed. This was the glorious time from 2.0.1 (BC prepatch) until patch 2.1
---
dat interaction, frostbolt goes for grounding totem but shammy still gets frostbitten.
---
I always hated these commercials.  They feel like they were made by a marketing team who has no idea whatsoever what they're selling and who they're supposed to sell it to.
---
Whew my bad, cheers.
---
Oh yes, the 2 positions most people hold. 
---
Honestly
---
Do you think, as a casual-ish Player it is possible to get full T1 &amp; Ashkandi on a Paladin? 
---
I could put in extra hours but I’m not going to go full no-life :)
---
As a future resto shaman who also wants to limit the cloth im going to wear, im not sure how viable red dragonscale breastplate will be. Its a low drop chance from the last boss in ubrs which is a hard dungeon. Failure rate and people leaving/disbanding is pretty common. On top of that it has to drop for someone who is even doing dragonscale lw which also isnt common since tribal lw is what makes the money. So you might want to look for an alternate choice.
---
I'm still torn between mage and rogue. I started wow at beginning of TBC, though at that point I didn't know much about that, I was just having fun with wow and all the newness of a game I'd never played. Had that character all the way through to end of Ulduar before I quit and came back on a new mage. So not sure what to decide, especially since my main atm is a DH.
---
Kinda a little annoyed that neither mage or rogues have cool lvl 60 quest chains like epic mount or benedictus though.
---
how about not changing the materials but setting a minimum time (e.g. 4 weeks or so because the War has to be prepared after and while the mats are handed in). Giving all pro guilds the chance to run for the worlds first without stressing too much casual players (if they even get stressed). Mats can be finished as fast as they want but they have to w8 for the preparation to be done after. This way would also not stand agaisnt the #nochanges guys
---
Well, it´s one of first orcish settlements on Azeroth and when I levelled in Swamp of Sorrows, I loved the contrast with rest of Eastern Kingdoms due to how big Horde presence was there. Basically the entire road was controlled by our mobs, there was the town and then that small camp on the shore. To 15 years old me it looked like it was the only place in the entire continent where I was safe as Horde (not in terms of world PvP, obviously) because of how many friendly NPCs were there.
---
Besides, it´s pretty big town.
---
If Classic becomes a success I think 1 week is perfectly reasonable for the World First opening.
---
That said, you only need one person on the server to be able to make the recipe and either you just buy the chest off the Auction House from them or find out who it is and farm some scales.
---
It's certainly going to be trickier than alternative options but it's a superb chest so any Shaman or Paladin Healer should really consider it. And whilst Tribal LWing is more common, Dragonscale is often viewed as "the hunter choice" for leatherworking. You get LOADS of Dragonscale Leather Hunters in Vanilla purely because "it makes sense" rather than any optimal theorycrafting. I'm sure the pattern will be more craftable than you think.
---
This is the best! As a horde player I got a little tear in my eye... 
---
Yep, but that's later on.
---
If you can find a guild that raids even two days a week, yeah, full T1 is easily doable in my opinion.
---
Ashkandi is a whole different story. First they give it to warriors, then maybe hunters that lack better weapons. When every DPS that wants it has gotten it, then comes paladins. Since let's be real, if you raid, you will be healing. So it might take a while. Oh, and the whole progression thing. And drop rate. So it will take a while.
---
You're right, it's probably just wishful thinking lol. Classic with old graphics is still better than no classic, but I really hope the will provide both.
---
About 14 years ago. Then we did not have loot sharing.

So just logged into my balance druid for the first time since WoD, saw that lunar/solar bar is gone and now replaced with astral power. How does that work? I liked the old system, felt like it required skill to pull off at a high lvl, why did they remove that?
---
The Itemlvl requirement for enchants came with the Burning Crusade where enchants like mungo, leg enchants with +30 Sta +22 Agi and other could have destroyed Pvp for people without max lvl characters. But the patch came in the late BC so some people managed to abuse it before. And even after the patch people found ways to get items which could be enchanted.
---
I think the lvl 60 enchants are very important to balance 29 PVP because spellcasters otherwise had no option for stacking a large amount of Spellpower. These enchants managed to change this and therefore balanced the dominance of meleeclasses who could easy stack agi and Str (Warris, Rouges).
---
Actually BC same as Classic were a glorious times for 29 Bracket, the Dungeonbrowser in Wrath destroyed it. So enchant itemlevelrequirements are non existent for classic which is fine i guess.
---
What really happens in this hypothetical.  Priest rolls need. Main hand is bound to priest and his friends bitch at him for wasting loot.
---
There is actually a spirit beast you can get that hides in these bushes, it’s the fox one. 
---
The Silvio one with the Godfather quote was the most accurate. This game never let's go. 
---
Holy cow that‘s hilarious!
---
How could I miss that.
---
The guy at the end of the video was a Pandaren who just stumbled on to me recording the lvl 1 Gnomist violence.
---
I have nothing to add but say thank you very much. This is exactly the kind of reply I was looking for.
---
A player can do this on normal group loot in 5 man, ive done it in the past. Say you will roll need on the item unless someone pays you gold...
---
We purchased the hp pavillion with the 1050ti for my wife. Seems to play retail just fine. 700 well spent. 
---
It's an older code sir but it checks out
---
You should try leveling in Teldrassil and darkshore
---
Live had xrz and rdf and instant groups for content. You had 100% anonymity and 0 reputation to uphold. Classic is the complete opposite?
---
Honestly this is why I'm gonna roll PVP-RP instead of PVP. It's just like a regular PVP server but with a lot less toxicity.
---
Reserving loot is 100% guaranteed. Loot trading still means there is a roll and a chance of losing. So your claim is absolutely false lmfao
---
You're a healer, lets say priest or druid, and notice that a group of people need a healer for deadmines. You shift click their name and see they are level 20. You get into the group and notice a couple other level 20's and a level 16 mage. Nothing drops for you the whole instance and then that's when it happens, the emberstone staff drops. You roll need, then you notice the warrior tank also rolling need... and the hunter and everyone else. The tank wins it, you're feeling a mix of bad emotions as you realize that because he rolled Need on it the item is now soulbound to him and cant be traded.
---
Planning and dead dungeon runs using your main/friends. Getting everything without leveling out of the bracket was part of the fun. 
---
How much is RP and expectation on rolling on a server like that?
---
I have intentions of forming a guild which is mind over matter on a PVP Server, but if attitudes are better on a PVP-RP server maybe that'd be a better option?
---
This is pretty cool! Though, it keeps coming back with moonmoon for me?
---
The RTX 2060 would be preferable to a GTX1070 or 1080 in terms of price/performance. In fact, the Founders Edition (ie the nVidia Homebrand card) just came back in stock worldwide and can be purchased for \~€380 in the EU (depending on local VAT rates) or even cheaper if you are buying in the US, where it comes in at \~$350. 
---
The reason I would go for the Founders Edition over an ASUS or similar, specifically for the 2060 variant, is that it has the "VirtualLink" USB-C port at the back which the vast majority or 3rd party cards do not. It's not a must have but does offer some VR future-proofing without costing you anything. (Note: All versions of the 2070 or 2080 have this slot)
---
You and your pet can buff anyone on the opposite faction. Just target them, hit pet attack and any abilities you want to help them die with.
---
LFR changed that to “feel free to afk.”
---
The only problem is when you get a new rank. 2 bluffs, time to drink.
---
You're going to lose $100 bud. You don't have any idea the amount of materials needed do you? It's taken at least a month on pservers that have the population of 4-5 normal blizzard servers, with people online AROUND THE CLOCK FARMING (NA, EU, CN).
---
You can always combine some of them. Something like "Dinkletootiblare".
---
Good stuff!
---
Was Nym &amp; co involved in this?
---
When I played on a private server, many were advocating macros to change stance and then use an ability. It really kills the fun of playing a warrior and I would not recommend doing so.
---
Because you're not making a clear representation of what actually happened. In SOME certain cases a GM may have stepped in to correct or fix some looting error. Loot trading was not something you could abuse by making tickets for every single boss for every single dungeon. You dont mention these facts when you only say 'there was loot trading in vanilla'. Theres an objective difference between abusing the ticket system to lie to GMs, and simply clicking need and trading the item.
---
&gt;  it was routinely used
---
[Citation needed]
---
Accidental mis-looting through master looter almost never happens on private servers.
---
Were these macros created with help of an addon (supermacro) or part of actual vanilla? Because in the latter case it makes perfect sense to use them
---
&gt; Warriors are pretty fast if you know what you’re doing
---
No they're not. Warrior is the most gear-dependent class in the game, no amount of "knowing what you're doing" can make you autoattack and heroic strike any faster.
---
You're not getting 1.2k DPS on any boss on any pre-raid BIS class
---
I hope you're correct, but I don't have faith. When the dungeon finder came almost everyone rolled need on everything. Didn't matter if they were just going to vendor it or not. It was a problem that was getting worse over time too.
---
I thought it was burning crusade that introduced it, the "this enchant can only be put on weapons over level 35"
---
All toxic behaviour cannot be policed sadly. Even so, your example still doesnt justify having loot-trading as a mechanic.
---
Bad guild killing kt was not impossible. 
---
Also, debuffs were rotating on horsemen since raid rotates around, have you ever done this boss in retail and not kiddie broken private servers?
---
You cannot police attitude. You can however police actions by having a good loot system, and the retail vanilla loot system is FAR superior to the frankenstein that loot-trading is.
---
I will make it LEGAL!
---
All the professions already give good reasons to take them.
---
Tailoring-bags, mooncloth, bop robes, etc.
---
Leatherworking-healing cloak, huuuuuuge profits on devilsaur armor, etc.
---
Blacksmithing-able to make and use keys to open doors &amp; chests, big profits on weapons &amp; armor like arcanite reaper, lionheart helm, etc. 
---
Engineering- great leveling helmets, so many cool toys: net-o-matic, jumper cables, death Ray's, rocket boots, teleporters, parachute cloak, etc.
---
Alchemy- huge profits on transmutes, and many many useful options and flasks.
---
Gathering professions: guaranteed income by going out in the world and clicking on the right stuff. Easiest way to gain a decent amount of gold from professions without having to farm specific patterns.
---
Enchanting- you get one of the more "rare" patterns early and you'll have more gold coming in as tips than any other profession.
---
None of them need anything else, and people like the ones they like. The bop patterns for tailoring are really only VERY useful for those who are tip of the spear, competative raiders.
---
I know exactly the amount needed. The thing is, on private servers there isn't really any incentive to speed it up. Especially when the developers artificially guarantee it to be finished after a certain amount of time. But what do you think happens when there's, what 20-30+ servers globally? Do you think the chinese servers will just concede in the world first race to westeners? It is an insane amount of resources, but the incentive is there in Classic as opposed to private servers.
---
The kid with no manners will ninjaloot and be a douche either way, his friends wont help him ninja with loot trading because he wants to
---
It shows you that anyone can pick a topic and show how it can be detrimental or toxic. I dont see loot trading as an issue just as i dont see the current systems as an issue, we as players will find a way to work around it. 
---
You run 50% faster when you're a ghost! That's a huge buff! 
---
I've tanked up to nef on a pserver and I've never really understood how to stance dance effectively.  Could anyone recommend some good videos breaking it down specifically with regards to tanking?
---
LOL yup, that sound meant "might as well go for a bio and top up my snacks"
---
Both factions:
---
90,000 copper bars
---
26,000 purple lotus
---
80,000 thick leather
---
17,000 spotted yellowtail
---
400,000 runecloth bandages
---
Alliance:
---
180,000 light leather
---
800,000 linen bandages
---
110,000 medium leather
---
33,000 stranglekelp
---
14,000 rainbow fin albacore

28,000 iron bars

20,000 roast raptor
---
600,000 silk bandages

10,000 baked salmon
---
We most likely won't have mega servers. Do *not* underestimate these numbers
---
Noobs 
---
I suspect that the development resources for this would be enormous. One public vote, which may appear simplistic enough, could have a chain effect to many other factors that devs would need to address. You’re basically asking Blizz to redevelop an old game al la carte.
---
I also think it’s important to remember that Blizz wants people playing retail.
---
Also people have been concentrated on to single servers for the war efforts on private servers. They didn't raise the supplies needed for the private servers so having 6-10k players that know the game decently well accelerated it quite a bit
---
What do you mean perfect sense? I am not forbidding anyone of using them? I am just saying that my personal feeling is that it is boring to click one button once to go to berserker and click the same button again to intercept etc. It is more challenging and more fun to have the stances on separate binds and to figure out and master the remaining keybinds.
---
There wasn't. You could enchant a skinning knife with crusader if you wanted to.
---
No changes to the data.
---
It's a PVP weapon, they should be giving it to any class that can use it. If he's a casual then he should join a guild that determines class priority for PVP loot.
---
Cue the fallout boy remix of dance dance, to Stance Dance. 
---
Both factions needs: 90k Copper Bars, 26k Purple Lotus, 80k Thick Leather, 17k Spotted Yellowtail and 400k Runecloth Bandages.
---
Then each faction required individual items aswell. The Alliance requires 800k Linen Bandages. 800k! 
---
Now, if you believe a guild/a few players is gonna stack all the items needed, they will probably need to be checked out for botting.
---
Might be possible to sit on atlest maybe 1 of the items, but highly doubt ALL of them.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I was trying to express. 
---
So you would do it underleveled as a DPS but not a healer? That doesn't make any sense.
---
It was
---
&gt; But also, UBRS is literally the only place where you can concoct a  scenario like this where trading Need-rolled gear even matters. 
---
Not true, there's tons of 5-mans which drop pre-raid bis and even if you were right my point still stands for one of the most important dungeons.
---
&gt; You're never going to be a rogue joining a 5-toon group with two other  rogues and fury warrior, and if you do then you all deserve what you  get. 
---
Ok sure but a lot of dungeon groups take two casters which need some of the same gear as healers. Also what if the tank wants a leather piece for his DPS off set?
---
&gt;And since Blizzard almost certainly won't allow trading Need-rolled items, just Greed-rolled, all of this pantswetting is over nothing.
---
Have they ever said this? Why would it work differently from how it operates on retail and what problem would it even solve if it was implemented this way?
---
Ah I remember playing late at night as a kid and being scared by those eyes x.x Good times, great zones, ambience, music etc.
---
Do you even understand what loot trading is?
---
It isn't my favourate, but in terms of experiance I'd say Barrens
---
As a healer I prefer when my group members split up like it's Scooby Doo and I gotta choose whether to stay with the tank or go heal the mage at 30% health.
---
I was just dicking around tbh. There's no way I'm using a fantasy character name tool. Too rp for me
---
Looks like he has mastered the art of the KFC bucket.
---
Or when you're a tank and the DPS are 100m ahead trying to aggro every mob because the dungeon and mechanics are so easy that  a functioning brain isn't even a requirement to complete it.
---
Robes of the Exalted - cloth, but it's a direct upgrade over Red Dragonscale Breastplate.
---
The Star Wars Galaxies random name generator is responsible for my game, 15 years later I'm still using it.
---
Do soulshards disappear when you're logged out?
---
That's what I'm hoping for because there's no other alternative to wearing cloth and getting almost the same stats.
---
GW2 has a group lister too with no matchmaker, and it's a pretty great experience for fractals, you can join 'daily/try hard groups' that are getting in and out as fast as possible, or you join progression/beginner ones to work together.
---
All you need are these simple filters. With matchmaker it just puts incompatible players together and you have no choice but to spin the wheel again next time. Same thing goes for shooters vs old private servers. Matchmakers are poison, they're the biggest problem with modern online games.
---
Through GM tickets is what I hear but I literally never saw that happen or even heard of it until people started defending loot trading 
---
non of the items used in the 1.2k dps had any procs on it so its not relevant
---
wonderful
---
&gt; World First AQ clear will depend on it.
---
I don't think anyone cares so direly about "world first" in a re-release of a 15 year old game that they will stockpile literally hundreds of thousands of items in order to complete the war effort super fast.
---
yes you do. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/265877705
---
that was 1.4k dps. all the items used will be in classic wow from the start
---
&gt; Wrongnozzlefixxit
---
I wouldn't trust my Wrong nozzle with a gnome
---
90 minutes is already quite fast for a private server WC run lol
---
Pre raid bis but lists recipe drop from raids
---
Really makes you think
---
Not a video, but it’s tied to hotkeying your stances and having muscle memory of what is under the stances.   For raid fights it’s mostly to predict fears and jump to zerk, pop zerk rage, and go back to defense.  PvP (in basic terms) between battle and zerk stance abilities more often.
---
For pve, before there was boss mods, this made predicting what was coming really important.
---
Today, even on vanilla, much of that manual thinking is replaced with addons and macros.  
---
Throw in a taut dragonhide belt, eskhander's collar, sergeant's cape, arathor battle tabard, ring of binding, fordring's seal, rune of metamorphosis, and the pvp trinket, and you've got a spitting image of my og rank 13 druid. Fun fact, they gave the first guild Lok'amir to me over the paladins... there is hope!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0wciSPO9zg
---
The problem for me is there's no 'serious' content accessible to a casual player. m0's and even heroic raids now are puggable, meanwhile LFR or Normal raids and heroic dungeons don't even require a functioning brain to finish and get loot.
---
Just because I'm a casual player doens't mean I want everything I do to be mind-numbingly boring.
---
Yeah same here, I'm thinking what's the rush? By the sounds of it the classic servers will be here to stay for the foreseeable future.
---
I'll be happy to get 60 by the time BWL drops.
---
I may be biased, but Darkshore is so full of quests even though it’s so small, I usually do a reverse Wetlands run just so I can level there
---
I exclusively leveled from 55-60 in Silithus farming texts... fml that was the worst, also paid off, but still the worst. I have tons of memories from there though. 
---
Yes there are no restrictions on where you can use them. But some of them share cooldown.
---
You will spend around the same time farming the mats for the potions as you would farming gold to buy them at the AH. (Depending on your class).
---
Who even upvoted this 
---
They can be so terrible because they played years before Vurtne or Voidim ever released their 1st videos. Most early Vanilla players weren't even searching through forums for the few PvP videos that existed. No1 really taught them how to play.
---
(Otherguy did release his 1st video real early but he was not that famous plus he was fire, only used dampen in like 2 clips and backpedals a bit—though he was amazing compared to the average Vanilla player.)  
---
...In 2019 the comment sections are filled with people claiming to have played so perfectly in Vanilla yet 14 years ago the servers were not filled with perfect players...  
---
I believe they persist through logout.
---
Most likely to simplify the spell rotations. 
---
Exactly we need 5 posts a day about it god dammit  
---
how else is blizzard everrr going to hear our cries  
---
i might make a post myself i feel we are a little short today  
---
Jks but no loot trading please
---
Hah, glad you liked the podcast and all the old nostalgia videos.
---
I can't really see the argument here. Why press 2 separate buttons when you can press 1? Does having to go through more keybinds make the game more interactive?
---
&gt;Ret is literally a non-viable 
---
Bad take, non-viable != non-optimal
---
I do the same, it's my best guess for the most efficient, but still unsure.
---
I wish this is how private servers worked. I hope we can at least get some of it back in classic with the more diverse playerbase 
---
I dont think so. The are not considered a soulbound item like healthstones and soulstones.
---
If you actually take the time and do Darkshore then you might as well do Ashenvale for the extra xp, leaving you at around 32 when you’re finished, at which point you can easily go to Arathi, Hillsbrad/Alterac, 1k Needles, STVietnam etc.
---
Yeah, it would be a little similar to the master looter case; the loot goes back to the ML instead of some other player.
---
Is there a need to re-spawn the monster corpse (if it has disappeared)? Can't it just cause a new roll and when that roll completes, the item gets re-distributed?
---
STV.... if only you could avoid pvp...
---
I used to keep my stances on f1-f3. Then had beserker rage on hotkey 3. I could quickly stance dance if I saw a fear being cast or was pushing a priest to prevent a fear. 
---
Would you want one button that did everything as, say, a warlock? Check for corruption, if not cast then cast corruption, check for CoA if not cast CoA, else shadowbolt, if target lower than 10% drain soul. Clicking one button - wow very fun gameplay.
---
For less skilled warriors it is helpful with the macros but it is in my opinion less fun.
---
You can play the game like you want and I'll play the game like I want. I was merely making a suggestion but people are upset and downvoting me and I don't want to upset people anymore.
---
"My spirit is so high, I'm just goona sit here and regen."
---
The mini-me one is what made me try the game.
---
It’s 100% worth practicing how to pull multiple mobs: send void on one, fear another and kill a third. Speeds leveling up like crazy.
---
T1, easily. Ashkandi is an odd question because it doesnt go very well with that set. Depends how casual you are, how casual your guild is and if you actually PvP a lot. Theyre not going to give you Ashkandi if you never PvP, as its a BiS PvP weapon for Warriors and Hunters as well before AQ40 launches.
---
Belt says added in 1.4 as well. Gonna be interesting though to see what items will be available at launch.
---
Your reply had absolutely nothing to do with the current discussion, so I dont really give a shit what point you are trying to make. You are just derailing because you know Im right and loot trading is a poor system.
---
Id love for more touches like this. Imagine if there were lvl ?? Mobs in random spots that just kill you, something lore rich and mysterious, and itd have no point for several expansions, but in the interim itd be mysterioussssssss
---
There's always been elitism about how many button presses are required to ay well. Stance dancing is a good example. Warriors par themselves on the back for having the incredible skill required to press a button to switch stance, then another to gain fear immunity. Such levels of skills are unparalleled in Vanilla! 
---
Its not that difficult to keep shards topped up. In raiding, as long as you keep your bag full throughout the raid, you shouldnt have too much trouble. The main complaints come from Locks tryharding the DPS meters whining that they lose a bit when they Drain Soul on trash mobs. 
---
In PvP, it kinda sucks, its hard to find opportunites to Drain Soul and you might have to make frequent flights to WPL/Azshara for shards.
---
I know it’s an odd question :) 
---
Reason behind this is when I played Vanilla back then I was like 14 yrs old &amp; the coolest thing imaginable for me was to have T1 pala &amp; ashkandi. I want to accomplish exactly that &amp; then hop into PvP with that setup. 
---
I know this setup is not optimal but tbh I was a rookie back then but I really knew how to play my pala. I clearly remember how I bashed ppl with suboptimal gear, that’s what I love about Vanilla. 
---
I know that my guild isn’t just going to hand me ashkandi the first time it drops but I’ll just trust the community of a RP-PVP server and hope to find a guild that doesn’t neglect me ashkandi from the beginning. 
---
I’d be happy to be a trusty raid healer in exchange for a chance on ashkandi. 
---
Dev time required, probably a lot to implement both your solution and the chest for skinned mobs thing. Plus time required to test it, work out bugs, and then when actual players get hold of it deal with the inevitable stream of new bugs. 
---
And this is the sort of thing we couldve only learned by changing shit over the years. So, all in all, im glad weve gotten to experience the shift of retail.
---
Not great, but worthwhile, youll be getting quests done and getting gear so its good for time efficiency. As a DPS it might be hard to find a group, because 58 will mean youll be doing less DPS and theres certain areas that might require an extra pull or 2. Some people dont mind, but I generally never take lower levels, theres always enough 60 DPS around to take instead. As a healer youll find groups all right and as a tank, you make the group.
---
YES! Deadwind Pass was just a location shrouded in mystery and eerieness. I too remember just riding through the zone feeling a bit spooked, but also intrigued by it.
---
Ashenvale does have a lot of nice quests, however i worry about the presence of Horde there. I'm playing Warrior so i expect to have difficulty in WPVP but if im with the curve i guess it shouldn't be too much of a problem. I guess i can slot it in around 25 or so when i go over to do BFD - or would you recommend earlier?  
---
I'll look into the areas you mentioned for post 30. I was told not to bother with Arathi as it doesn't have enough quests so i was thinking like Southshore or Hillsbrad, but i hadn't considered 1k needles
---
It would be pretty hard to get a PuG to join your premade dugneon group if you have master loot on for everything. At least a smart PuG.
---
What's toxic about loot trading? Just seems like another game mechanic to me. 
---
Orc-Chasm......priceless. Totally don't remember that one.
---
This didn't happen in vanilla. Not in dungeons. 
---
Let's make Azeroth hateful place again. I can't wait to camp flying point in Searing Gorge and dispel world buffs. You can feel the seething hate coming towards you. I also learned to do it only before I log out. Turns out 40 pissed off raiders are good at spawn killing.
---
The in game systems trump everything. If they are conducive to social play, social play will happen. If we have facless grouping and revolving door party mechanics, no one cares about anyone, just pushing forward. 
---
I noticed this when it playing private servers, that much of the community acted the way they did in vanilla. We might have changed as gamers, but the game itself really pushes the interactions.
---
I think if we started with bfa and nothing before itd there wouldnt even really be a community.
---
Yeah lots of rose colored glasses going on.
---
Because Chain Lightning is a lot easier to get off with cast time because shamans don't have something like ice barrier. They have a talent that stops pushback when crit talent that helps out but you can't abuse it with /sit against pets like you could on private servers.
---
You can also get the CL off in between Grounding totem and someone killing it a lot as well. 
---
As far as combo it depends if you are tauren. You have a /startattack on all abilities and a stop attack on the grenade and this gets you extra damge before and after the combo.
---
A tauren combo if you have a warrior sitting on you or something in melee range would be something like firenova totem, warsomp, (Ele Mastery if you have it), Chain lightning. shock and all of that hits at once (of course if it's a caster that can cc heal and it doesn't look like it's gonna die you could delay the eshock and cast lightning instead at the end).
---
If nswiftness that lightning is instant OR you could start casting an iron grenade which should get you another lightning, shock, autoattack swing.
---
On a non tauren or on grenade combos, things are kind of reversed and you set up with a iron grenade. So you would nova, into grenade, into lightning since you have more time then stomp, shock and you would then have a chain lightning available.
---
You can see some of these combos being done here (vid starts off with one vs a warrior) and it's pretty much the only video I have seen with a good Tauren and a shaman who just doesn't sit back and nuke wasting tons of dmg by not autoswinging, while also causing pushback on casters passively. Some other tricks in the video like nswiftness into ghostwolf to escape a gank, using hearthstone to bait an interrupt due to tauren casting animation.

Have fun being a tesla coil.

World first AQ was 4/25/2006, there is no race. You can't redo these things. 
---
Dibs on Pralinesanddick
---
1k needles (well, shimmering flats) has quite a few nice quests, but also loads of horde. Arathi has a few quests but it’s true that there aren’t many (there are a few pirate quests on the shore). But Hillsbrad+Alterac is nice. But... you gotta power through those contested zones eventually:(    
---
I recommend you go Arms starting from level 10. It levels a bit slower, but even the early talents are a lot better in PvP than fury.
---
This is a decent plan. My main gripe is that there isn't much more they could swap out since they had so many items required. But adding in profession stuff is a great idea. Fits with the theme, but breaks the lists of best way to go about farming the war effort mats.
---
If you're on a PvE server, Stranglethorn Vale.
---
PvP and Alliance, probably Duskwood. Wetlands and Darkshore are also good candidates.
---
PvP and Horde... probably Barrens? I don't have much Horde experience, so I'm not sure there.
---
(The real answer though is Scarlet Monastary. Just grinding Armoury or Cathedral runs over and over gives you so much XP it actually makes questing somewhat redundant until the trash turns green - although the quests there are good as well.)
---
Blizzard had auto-donations from the server, the majority of most of the war effort was cheated by Blizz, at least on most smaller servers. Im not sure when it ticked up, weekly, monthly? But we sure didnt go to the effort of farming it on Gul'Dan
---
I think airing commercials that specifically say they're bringing back vanilla would bring more people in. I bet there's millions of people who haven't played wow in 10 years who'd love to play again and don't even know about classic. 
---
Yeah, thats why heirlooms really killed it. The game is sooooo easy that there isnt any reason to talk, or strategize, or be there. Its so obvious that I wholly believe whoever makes decisions just doesn’t prioritize having actual human experiences. But then again, thats what classic is for.
---
Albis had a lot of it figured out very early on. Very good videos for the time. 
---
That's an obvious choice but since I wanted to build gear without as much cloth as possible, I'm avoiding it. 
---
There should never be a timer. This is a great server event that forces the whole server to work for something. If you want to continue in raid progression, you make it happen. 
---
Amazing! Thank you for the detail. I am thinking of rolling Hunter like my Live Main, thus seems that Engineering + a money maker is the way to go. 
---
I'm not crafting it myself and I don't want to get server first kills. So tell me what you're thinking about.
---
Just to butt in to the conversation, how much more dmg does engineering bombs etc bring to boss fights? There's not that much AoE/cleave fights, well maybe AQ40 bugs and Nefarian, but overall is it really "needed" for a hunter trying to go for top DPS?
---
I'd like a collectors edition with physical things. No in game special pets or anything 
---
The problem is that lfd/lfr replaced a large part of the game, just to be a shell of what grouping was. Thats like replacing an action movies language to lithuanian and having people see it who only speak english. Sure, the dialogue isnt really the focus...... the combat scenes/car chases/shoot outs are, but it replaced the english dialogue which was important too.
---
Worse yet is had this weird antisocial effect which fucked up questing/playing in general (because people just grind dungeons).
---
I didn't check this. Thank you. Boots for healers will be scarce if they don't put these in at launch. I would probably go for lightforge boots then.
---
No change to the materials, no change to the base amounts required for each.  What they should do is add an additional amount required for each item per count in player inventory server-wide.  Adds a slight amount of time required as not everything would be earmarked for AQ in advance. 
---
Loved it when I mained a gnome warrior through Vanilla and BC 👍🏻👍🏻
---
I think everything, including Sapphiron shoulder enchants non-bound items. I think ZG helm/leg enchants could be used on non-bind items too.
---
That'd get you kicked in my group.
---
What level lockpicking do you need for all the scarlet monastery entrances?
---
Do priests get spirit tap triggered when in a group after a mob dies, if they didn’t do damage but healed (they got exp anyway)?
---
Do hunter pers grow larger as they level?
---
Hi, /u/lecorrele
---
&gt;  "some of the blacksmithing specs did not bring any value anymore because the items which could be crafted werent worth it"
---
Which specific blacksmithing path has nothing worthwhile in it? Quick off the cuff: Swordsmith - sageblade, axesmith - nightfall, hammersmith - eh ok, maybe this one. Armorsmithing is probably the most profitable/useful but the guilds will often need a axesmith, and as a vanilla swordsmith myself it was plenty useful/profitable. Sageblade was always a good seller/moneymaker.

At 30 You can grind in Duskwood, quest in Southshore/Alterac, start STV, do 1K, quest in Desolace and later Arathi which does have a fair few quests if you line it up right.   
---
If it helps, we'll have a guide available before launch for alliance side, or you can look for a couple of guides available now on the net from the old vanilla days which still work fine.  
---
FWIW, I do Darkshore, Redridge, Ashenvale, Wetlands, Duskwood, then at 30 I do Southshore, 1K, and onto STVietnam.

---
Man I can't wait to restart my human warlock, get through duskshire and westfall to relive duskwood and stitches.  It needs to be summer. 
---
Thank God game of thrones will pull me through half way to wow classic, just need another joke fuller until then.  Maybe another old school game like OSRS.
---
Yeah, seems weird.  The item is just code, it doesn't have reside anywhere, like a chest or on a mob.  Literally anything could be set to trigger a new roll.  In the original sense, sparkles appear and you click them to trigger.
---
You could just out sparkles on the players feet, or drop a chest at their location.
---
Honestly could just be a right click option for the item itself, selecting reroll or w/e.
---
Either way, all loot is just RNG if it drops, RNG what you roll for it, RNG is the "wrong" person gets it.  I say just live with what you're dealt.
---
Depends if you are on a PVP server.  If you are then it all changes and I would be looking at lower level zones. Alliance is simply a lot better there past the starter zones. Darkshore is good due to the sea creatures which are free crazy XP. Duskwood is insanely good due to the stockades quests and it being such a fast, easily accessible dungeon. Alliance just has more choices and they can exploit those choices doing only the easy quests up to about 30 when it's much more even. It's one reason Barrens is so crazy. ALL the horde are there at one time or another and you got lots of long runs between quests because the zone is huge. 
---
On PVE servers, Desolace, Searing Gorge (depending on patch as most quests came out later in vanilla), STV, Western Plaguelands, Tanaris, Ungoro all have tons of quests. I would say Searing Gorge is probably the craziest if you have a class that can solo a few elites and has some drop luck.
---
I still main Horde. I did Alliance once and saw the quests and it was enough for me. The animations/races just aren't my cup of tea. I was a dwarf rogue and I just did dwarf to like 11ish after the cave troggs quest on the way to the next zone,  then did the easy quests there, moved on to the NE area and did the easiest quests there and the beached sea creatures (group was required for some of the lower ones but people always want to do it) then I moved on to westfall to do deadmines (rogue swords are nice there). 20-30 is like 4 zones and I had all the flightpaths. 
---
Was stupidly faster than any Horde I ever made to 30. Was the same after. Probably quire a bit slower as human as their starting zone is packed. Gnome, dwarves and NE really have it good it seems.
---
Precisely. Although I understand that some people want to be in the front row for every phase but there's no actual need to rush in order to experience all the content thoroughly. There's no TBC looming 'round the corner this time :)
---
Im guessing the damage increase needs to be so much so that you cast one less frostbolt for each mob. Otherwise the extra damage is wasted. 
---
Herbalism is the single biggest money maker in the entire game, contrary to what some others may claim or wish. Second is, of course, Alchemy.
---
As a hunter Engineering has even more added value in PVE farming because you can use the lockpicking seaforium charges to open doors in DM:tribute runs.
---
Im gonna regret this but Im actually looking forward to the 0.5 set quests. Never did those and I've set it up as a personal goal. Im gonna at least try my best.
---
" Leatherworking-healing cloak, huuuuuuge profits on devilsaur armor, etc " both of the mentioned ones were only accesable for tribal leather workers - i specificallly meant the elemental leatherworking spec which gives you pretty much nothing and is therefore a useless spec. Regarding the third, dragonscale leatherworking there are some stages in the game where you find some usable patterns but even here the number is limited to i guess 2 patterns...
---
Same goes for the Hammersmith spec in Blacksmithing which litterally noone goes for because there is nothing to get of which is gamebreaking.
---
That tribal leatherworking or Amorsmithing can be used to earn a lot of money was not questioned here. I just find it wrong that there are profession and a lot of mats coming with it which are just not used. And i do not think that this was the way it was meant in the beginning.
---
As far as the damage number goes, yeah. I wasn't lucky enough to get one of those before the changed it. I had a lvl 43ish that was +13 or 14 and I kept that for a long time.
---
What would you lose by implementing such recipes?
---
This is an example of overusing macros
---
I'm gonna be in the same situation, I'm east coast and would like to raid 7-10pm but feel like it'll be hard to find a guild like that
---
For spirit tap you had to get the killing blow.
---
I'm pretty sure hunters pets grew as they leveled but I'm not 100% on that.
---
Rogue would tear that guy up if starting from stealth.  Warrior with that gear has less than 4k armor and is likely in Berserker Stance, can be stunlocked 100-0.
---
Thats fine i am usually the part leader myself, but alas its almost like the community works itself out
---
Now bear in mind I've never done this personally but I'd imagine this is how it works:
---
You and a number of others kill yourself when the boss is at low HP, release spirit and leave the raid group. Therefore not getting the kill and preventing yourself from becoming locked. This makes it so the raid group is smaller as the boss goes down and more people get loot. 
---
You are then able to do the boss again and again, funneling loot to a set number of players every time.
---
yep. Memercials.
---
tldw: he begs for money and people give him money
---
It would be best used in naxx since there are much more aoe fights there. It will give you a dps boost, not sure by how much.
---
hey i was being serious when i said easiest way to make gold XD 
---
I was talking about the Hammersmith spec and also about the swordsmith spec. As far as i know the Sageblade was implemented in AQ Patch which litterally made is useless for the first half of the game (which affects most of the casuals)
---
That Nightfall/Lionheart were a gamechanging items i totally agree with but thats only 50% of what Blacksmithing is about. 
---
What exactly would you lose with implementing a small amount of new items to bring more variety into raiding?
---
I beleive I found one for classic that's going to try and raid 6-10. Hopefully it works out!
---
You know, BiS is BiS - you don't get to choose which pieces are bis, they are bis because they have the best stats. You can do just fine with the gear you have listed here, it just won't be the very best aka BiS. Red dragonscale breastplate is a very good item, but robe of the exalted is just better. So you'll have to pick whether you want to look good, or wear a dress and perform a bit higher.

&gt; Is there a need to re-spawn the monster corpse (if it has disappeared)?
---
This one is more about the design of the system and is subjective. I believe that it's important to keep things in the world in order to create a sense of continuity. The item is going to travel from Point A -&gt; Point B -&gt; Point A -&gt; Point C then I'd prefer that each point is visually represented. Introducing menus and warping loot is not optimal in this sense. 
---
That said, I wouldn't be opposed to a "return and reroll" menu system. I just hate the idea of menus replacing a piece of "reality" in the virtual world. 
---
What kind of an example is that?  The Rogue is already killing someone in PvP.  The Warrior runs up to assist the Rogue's target.  It took at least the first 5 seconds of the fight for the Rogue to even start on the Warrior, because he's still killing the other Alliance!
---
Not at all,
---
Y I K E S
---
You're right, i guess i will have to bite the bullet at some point.  
---
And yeah i 100% level as Arms, even outside of PvP i just find it more engaging gameplay wise, and Anger Management is a godsend for dungeons
---
I used too love helping people learn, anything from there role too class specific things if I had experience with the class. I used too play alot of 1am-4am server and getting a group and farming 5 mans was one of my favorites. Even some groups that started rough ended up being a blast after a run or 3. I cant wait!
---
Check my post history for a superior loot trading compromise.
---
Is loot determined when a mob spawns or when it's killed.
---
GeForce 1080 has 2GB more VRAM and about 14% better overall performance than a 2060 without factoring in any overclocking.
---
Your solution is great, but here's a better one...
---
# GMs should immediately close all loot based tickets. 
---
Thank you for the info. What level are you usually at upon heading to STV? I'm thinking like 33? 
---
Imo this was actually part of the challenge. Silly they changed it since messing up your twink was a big deal and made it a lot more rewarding to do it well without getting too much xp
---
The alliance version is the best one by a long shot.

That quest chain was god tier too.

 [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-1-60-alliance-leveling-guide/) 
---
I couldn't be certain but I would say it's highly likely that loot is determined when the mob dies. Otherwise there would have to be some kind of database table on every mob in the game at the same time which contact their loot which seems like a waste of resources.
---
Just make a game yourself. A game with perfect balance and harmony. Make it perfect in every sense.
---
That, however, is not what we're doing here. Here we're *re-creating* Classic WoW. There's a recipe for it, and it doesn't include random changes to professions.
---
Tell me: If you re-create lasagna from a recipe, do you put a big piece of rotting fish in it? No, you don't. You follow the recipe. Stop trying to make the community diverge from the recipe of Classic.
---
Haha thanks! It's honestly sad how bad I am at spelling. I'm fine in German but can't figure it out to save my life in English. 
---
Plenty of people intend to and that is what matters...
---
Your idea is solid. Clearly, if Blizzard insists on implementing a system, there are reasonable ways to do it. We've shown two ways that loot can be transferred consensually and transparently.
---
If you’re AOE leveling emberstone. You’ll do enough damage and you wanna focus on Stam and int. 
---
If you’re solo target leveling the ice staff is good 
---
I laughed when he completely removed his weapons and chest piece to "look poor." There's literally no reason any character wouldn't have a chest piece or a weapon of some sort.
---
I remember trying this in vanilla just to see how much you make. No one really gives money out lol. I think I got 5g in total
---
Chain pulling at higher levels with victory rush? There was a video back when classic was current that explained how to do it, when people were claiming what you are that warriors were under powered and he made a video that showed they weren’t, and then they were actually needed because of his video. 
---
Pretty sure if you turn your ambience all the way up and music and sound down in Tirisfal Glades, you can hear whispers of a titan that’s hurried underneath the ground. 
---
Saw a video about it by MadSeason I believe, but I’m not too sure. 
---
Yeah, they already stated they will start with 1.12 talents at blizzcon.
---
Just the Barrens music, it’s like 15 notes on some kind of flute and it can make me cry in the span of 2 seconds 
---
I was trying to be helpful m bit whatever. No wonder wow players don't talk anymore.
---
The problem is that the community is too stubborn to adapt. No player wants loot trading, but Blizzard does. That's why a compromise is *necessary* because peoples pigheadedness will lead nowhere but the current proposal by Blizzard at BlizzCon which is obviously antithetical to Classic.
---
I don't think i had one, definitely not one of significance even raiding my luck was absolutely turd 
---
To be fair, the vultures are worse because they can execute you. 
---
Sweet thanks for the detailed response. And thanks for the video!! After watching it I’m definitely considering playing shaman now for that war stomp combo.  Haven’t seen that before but it looks legit. Good shit 
---
Heh, it was just an honest mistake :(
---
Stance dancing is one of the best parts of the game
---
For some reason whenever I use a name generator, even if I get awesome results, it never feels right, you know? I will always know it wasn't made by me, and isn't *my* name.
---
If you mean Stitches the abomination I’m pretty sure he paths to Sentinel Hill naturally, NPC’s even have scripted lines for when he shows up
---
Before the AQ war effort content phase (i.e. before you can turn in cloth for rep) it is basically impossible to gain exalted with Darnassus by level 40. 
---
Maaaaaaybe early 50s if you seek out every Darn quest in the game to that point. 
---
Once you're 60 though I believe there are some repeatable quests in addition to every other quest in the game being open so it's just a matter of tracking down the right quests at that point.
---
Mor’Ladim in Raven Hill, one bad motherfucker

Wtf was the mr. bean one lmao

If one of your dots has a lot of time left when the mobs are dying, you might not want to use that dot on the next mob of the same type.

A lot of people role play on RP servers. That’s about it.

---
Warriors have a trinket to get out of stun and can pop a fap potion. Orc stun resist also exists, Dwarf racial to get out of blind/kiting exists. Gnome racial exists to get out of the kite, Demo shout reveals stealth. If you are losing to most rogues as a warrior you are bad. If you aren't doing better than 50/50 against the best rogues in the world you are not as good as you think you are. 
---
Any class can kill undergeared people in a few abilities. It's nothing to brag about and human warriors on a pvp server are all morons anyways. It's like bragging about beating a midget in basketball. 
---
You have to account for someone missing the jump and then getting lost.
---
There’s really not that much reason to stance dance while tanking, because that 10% mitigation and 10% threat is really important. The only times you want to switch out of defensive stance while tanking is to mocking blow or use berserker rage. I bind my stances to Z, X, and C, but I also have macros like one for mocking blow which will switch me to battle stance then use mocking blow. 
---
In PvP, there are tons of reasons to stance dance. Charge &gt; disarm &gt; Mortal Strike &gt; intercept &gt; mortal strike. That’s why 5/5 tactical mastery is key for PvP. 
---
Because you can press two different buttons faster than you can double press the same one
---
While I think loot trading is dumb, I have a work around: Master loot every dungeon you run. just get your party members to /roll for gear, that way nobody can mess around. Tell your party members beforehand and explain why, if they don't like it they can kick rocks. 
---
Or, you know, just have fun and explore. Having perfect information is what makes Vanilla much less fun

Let’s say it drops on a Tuesday.  Maybe start you vacay on Wednesday  and do a week and a half if you can.  Tuesday could have technical problems and heavy server load.  Also, you could try and change your sleep schedule so you will be sleeping during peek hours.
---
its works like all other RP server on all other games, they play barbiedolls with their "character". And invent drama out of nowhere. 
---
No but in all seriousness, it has a lot of "rules" and RP servers are pretty exciting if you're into that kind of thing. + people are very friendly. Things and Events, well just like any other RP, if you do something you need to invent a reason for doing it like; you are going to do DM:E, why ? whats the backstory ?
---
i personally dont understand it, but i have respect for the people beeing so creative.
---
In defense of the community, Blizzard are prone to making clumsy and ill thought-out changes to WoW that many in the community resisted in concept, in beta, and then in retail. There is strong precedent that they will find the worst possible thing way to do this. Most of the community are wise to be stubborn on this issue. I honestly hope they get their way and that no loot trading of any kind will be allowed. 
---
But we must assume that Blizzard are determined to utilize a system, as you say. Hopefully they monitor forums and realize that there are ways to do this correctly. 
---
The same thing we'd lose if we implemented new weapons, new mounts, new classes, new races.
---
It wouldn't be Vanilla WoW.
---
Basically RP servers are just PvE servers (unless its RPPvP). It just means that you get areas where people like create stories for their characters and act them out together in game.
---
I used to be quite an active RPer myself. But I haven't done it in years.
---
A lot of people think that you are always in-character so that strikes people as weird, but that's a misconception.
---
Though, if I wanted to RP I might just play retail since it looks nicer and there's more choice for customisation. In fact, the game is quite enjoyable as an RPer if you know the right people because it's independent of Blizzard's biggest weakness at the moment and that's creating engaging gameplay. RPers take care of that themselves!
---
Kill swamp jaguars 
---
I second this! I *WISH* I could just delete all information/knowledge I have about quests, items, areas, patches, etc... The feeling when you explore something that is new to you, man that is just unbeatable!! 
---
Nothing special in comparison to the other servers. The difference is mostly that there are communuties that roleplay while playing. Meaning they try to act as the character they play, rather than the player they are. Mostly its just to have fun a dick around, it doesnt mean you have to participate or that the people are roleplaying all the time. In general though, the population tends to be more relaxed and casual with less hardcore players.
---
Anyone else been watching distorted poor quality PvP vids from keyboard turners just for the memories?
---
Well, it would be more immersive if the item is looted from the body instead of being teleported between inventories.
---
Anyhow: loot trading, no thanks!
---
But then you wouldn't have had your eXpEcTaTiOnS sUbVeRtEd.
---
Not just that but all people end up doing late game is farming 7 minute runs of Jed/Rend in UBRS or 10 minute lava runs in BRD, it’s just too calculated and efficient and kills the immersion . I would honestly welcome it if they switched around the loot drops to make other dungeons more relevant 
---
So what was the advantage of playing on a PvP server again?
---
It’s not a timer, I remember new servers back when TBC launches that didn’t have AQ opened for the longest time. I believe ghostlands was one of the new ones that had extremely low population. Guile’s actually went to these servers in order to open them and get titles way after the fact and AQ wasn’t relevant. 
---
I'm referring to the quest where you collect venom. It's pure hell, has a drop chance of maybe 5% at most.
---
300 dps is about average for MC and that’s for a mage who can frostbolt for 10 minutes before going oom. There’s a reason Vanilla is notorious for poor balance 
---
I recall reading about "rules" and was probably thinking of them a bit too literally. Thanks for the response.

Victory Rush isn't in vanilla.
---
The best gold making profession by far is enchanting. It takes more time and good to level it up but once you do even a good amount of stuff you learn from the trainer is BiS so there will always be a demand for your services. I used to keep my bags full of enchanting mats amfor everything and charge ridiculous fees for my mats enchants and people rarely batted an eye

Dire Maul is phase 2. 
---
Unless the title changed, it says 'no clothadin' not plate only. Also, what even is this thread 'bis but not even close to bis because I am roleplaying'. I don't know why this warrants it's own thread but I understand that's my own opinion.
---
I /ignore people instantly that beg for gold.  However, I have been bored in org a couple times and ran someone through RFC just for the fun of it.
---
Yeah, not all scenes though.  But, you can easily tell which scenes they use it and boy are they close lol.
---
If it's not BiS, its piss.
---
I wish.  95% of people are there because they think the people are more mature, will have an easier time dominating a server because RP casuals, don't RP themselves but think it's more immersive to be around thise who do, some guy literally told me he doesn't think RPers should have a server to themselves so he plays there to presumably troll them, or a million other reasons.
---
The other 5% of people actually RP, generally as far away from the other 95% as they can.  RP groups are typically tightknit, small, and extremely outnumbered.
---
“Sorry raid leader, I’m complete trash and let one gnome stop me from having 5 major mana pots. It’s cool that I still keep my spot though right?”

No, it isn't. The race is over and anyone who claims to be going for a "World first" should simply be subject to ridicule. You should not indulge the delusions of mentally ill people.

Some quick examples of rules.*Names. You have to have a RP name. *Know what OOC is. When talking Out of Character, show you are talking OOC. There is more rules also, but on top of my head i dont know them, i have friends who RP:ed but i never got in to it.
---
No

because

Maybe also add karazhan and buff mana to oomkins and ele spec and give paladins button-attack and mages more fun raid rotation and more threat and mana to tank paladin and block to druid tank and endless stacks to manual crowd pummeler
---
I remember seeing them prior to cata but not after 
---
You're thinking of the original version of Bloodthirst.
---
Bloodthirst was originally "150% weapon damage, guaranteed crit" and could only be used after you dealt a killing blow. Hence, Warriors were able to go from mob to mob to mob fairly quickly because they could open on every single mob with a hefty crit. Though it was down at the bottom of the talent tree so you couldn't get it until 40ish.
---
Plenty of people could farm for weeks and still not have enough to open the gates.
---
Same goes for weapon procs. When my warrior healed himself with Julie’s Dagger, he’d cast a little renew on himself. 
---
Damn, 700 ping is really good for satellite. I grew up on a satellite network out a dirt road that rarely got below 2100ms. 2 full seconds will make lots of handshakes really unhappy, and all I could really play online until I moved out was Toribash. Wanted to play WoW since TBC, could only actually start in Legion.
---
Are you saying ML without loot trading? Because that just sounds like a way for a guy to be a super ninja. I'm a ML warrior but my priest friend has a piece of gear drop? There you go, don't have to risk losing it with everyone rolling on it. Suck it, random Mage we just picked up who also wanted it 
---
&gt; Anyone who has actually looked into the issue and has the mind to comprehend it has already well understood that loot trading is not a good idea.
---
Lmao are you saying anyone who doesn't agree with you is ignorant or stupid?
---
My tip to you with Xlassic is don't. Just wander out wherever your feet take you. I envy you.
---
I'd argue that that's a small price to pay for a friendlier community. :3
---
its also not required, the amount of organization and what is essentially wasted gold to open the gates is way too much for a small part of a server community (which is really all that the hardcore raid scene amounts to) to take on. 
---

True. Good call. I want to look better and compensate with consumables and mastering my class.

not haveing engineering in pvp. Will put you behind people who do. The amount of granades/trinkets/on use items are amazing, if you dont have it. People who do will have the upper edge.
---
You rappin‘?
---
There are rules, such as no power gaming, no god-modding, no Mary Sue characters, and no metagaming.  If you do any of these, then you can expect the RP to stop and not be invited back in many cases.
---
It really helps if you identify yourself as a new RPer so others understand why, if something goes amiss.  But, going into RP blind or without a mentor is going to make it unfun for everyone.  If you ever want to start, I recommend finding someone with experience to walk you through stuff.  :)
---
There's also a tone of different types of RP so if you didn't like what was going on, try something different, whether it's PvP RP or some story adventure etc.
---
Nice, I missed these!
---
I think you don’t understand the problem. See all gm tickets look the same and they bloody will be if players get idea only certain ones get answers, instead you’ll get a flood of tickets you will have to pick though by hand but a great deal worse is the repetitional damages your advocating. They would take less damage if they just scraped Classic servers now than they would if they implemented your idea. To be honest this currently only affects a few angry people on the internet who are going to play the anyway so why listen to them. If anything since there has only been negative feedback so why listen at all?
---
I didn’t know there was a Hearthstone. The first time I saw the dam at Loch Modan, I was obviously like “I’m gonna jump off of this” and then spent the next hour trying to stealth past lvl ? Crocodiles as a lvl 11 gnome rogue on my way to Menethil, and then when I got there I didn’t have enough money for the FP so I had to wait for my friend to log on and give me the money so I can return to Ironforge.  
---
It was a really memorable experience 
---
I’m trying yes but it’s getting really difficult at the feet spot.
---
And we (hopefully) wont have it now so its a moot point
---
Fuck loot sharing.
---
As i said this post was not about diverging anything or anyone it was about creating diversity and freedom for players which was the concept of vanilla wow and is one of the main fundations of an MMORPG. And i wanted to ask for feedback and discussion which is why i appreciate the comments regardless of the opinion given.
---
I am wondering why you are so angry about that idea which in my eyes has no negative taste in it, therefore i ask you to give me some serious arguments against it. That is what i was trying to get with this post, not any "Diverging". 
---
I do not want to change the flavour of the game itself either, because i loved vanilla wow. Nevertheless there has always been class balancing and itemization changes also back then when it was the state of the game.  And there will be changes in the classic wow too, some of these are already confirmed. The question is if we discuss some things and create positive change with participation and offering ideas to the devs or if we just go for the #nochanges movement and lose our minds every time they come up with their own, in the community undiscussed ideas. That is what blizzard actually tried to show in their recent activity. They want us to participate.
---
So i ask again, what would you loose by e.g. revive dead professions if making sure it does only improve the variety  of the game? 
---
I think what most people are scared of regarding balancing/Itemization is that class identity will suffer from it and that the game would be kinda normalized. But if there are already professions not used because they dont bring any value and most of the hardcore player are going to pick the same professions (Engeneering e.g.) - isnt that what you call normalized? Giving no room for variety? The professions to change that already exist and only a few recipes could totally change the way they are seen.
---
To answer your question you do not want to hear an answar to anyway: If i would recreate lasagne i would follow the recipe for sure. But the spicing will always be different. It has to be adapted to the circumstances otherwise it would taste probably not as good ;)

That's where I lost it, "sold for vendor price". Why would I ninja gear and then sell it for vendor price, when I could AH for several times that amount?
---
I'm not a ninja, but you gotta think like one when discussing this stuff.
---
No loot trading OP.
---
I don't think people understand this part, because they are always on private servers riding the fresh wave. I'm all for no changes but it has to be 100% no changes. People are yelling out no changes but then want 5k server pop cap or then the server is "dead". Vanilla was not like that at all. Yeah some places were full of places but not like on private servers where every single mob spawn point has a party of people that are competing for mob tags. If you want to no changes the get ready for 2-2.5k server caps and long as respawn timers and long spawn times on resource nodes cause that is what no changes is.

Yeah, and arena. That's where we run into problems

About my experience with the game

Playing since wod but after bfa launch I pretty much played in pservers warrior both tank and dps (though I have not done naxx)
---
I am good at learning tho so I don't really think that will be a problem . 
---
Pm me for additional info or invites 
---
For the Alliance 
---
My point has been if everyone just runs master loot, even for dungeons, then party members can just /roll for shit they need. If a party leader pulls some shit, blacklist them. Its a stupid thing to implement, but the sky isn't falling.
---
&gt; to gain some gold
---
You get gold from running the raid. Also I like how you use a very endgame example to justify something. Fuck that.
---
A lot of people like the lore of the paladin and do really have issues with the concept of a clothadin. I just thought I share an alternative option that is as close as possible to the actual BiS.
---
I think I've tried to repress memories of running back after Chromag and Nefarian wipes in BWL. 
---
Any GM who supports this shit will be called out and have their pugs blacklisted.

Mentally ill for enjoying yourself playing a video game? What are you even doing here man.

I excluded Dire Maul since it’s phase 2. I hope to have quite a few Tier 1 Parts when DM comes out. Beside that i‘m really okay with the mail bracers from Scholo.

I think you could probably play this game on a waffle iron if you connected a monitor to it.
---
What? No I'm saying ML with loot trading. Also thats not a "suck it" situation, both the ML and the person who received the gear instead would be thrown on the list of ninja looters/people not to party with.
---
It just so happens we got a waffle iron from Lidl 2 weeks ago, any idea how to connect the monitor?
---
I'm one of them..  I still don't know exactly what's going on, but I'm excited.

---
If "blazing fast" means like 5 weeks, yes, you might be right.

Yes. And the most likely implementation of it will be how it was before they went to personal loot where BoP items could not be traded if they were rolled need.

The game will guide you, just go with the flow.

Hi, /u/Kaedex_
---
The current loot roulette system is an abomination, it should be need binds, greed doesn’t. Bosses drop loot from a pool. It’s simple really. It makes people communicate and appreciate their loot that much more. Sure it sucked when your group of cloth and plate had agil leather drop but that was the dungeon.
---
This discussion is not about class balancing in general, it is and was about reviving professions which are not used anymore because they do not bring value. So your comment is not topic related at all...
---
I made a ton of gold in 2004 pretending to be a teenage girl playing a nightelf priestess.   Guildies and other dirty old dudes were soooo nice to me, literally throwing gold at me.  Interesting contrast to getting jack-squat when  playing my ugly ass Undead Male priest.

---
linking a tips out video xD
---
his logs that he is using is for all bosses in a dungeon combined and not only a single boss like lucy that is perfect for war dps. also the logs come from nost/lh wich use 4700 armor values wich is 1k to much from what we know. calculations of armor values poin towards 3700 armor. that video i linked is myself and yes i am taking my epectations from private servers because they are not far off from what classic will be. i dont know where you guys take that idea from that private servers are totaly off from what classic will be.
---
And you underestimate just how many items are needed for the war effort. When I said "hundreds of thousands", I wasn't exaggerating.
---
Just in order to have that many items on-hand, you would need multiple accounts full of bank mules all with full 16 slotters and 16 slot banks, and even then it still wouldn't be enough to hold everything needed.
---
Yes it is, it slows your inputs by having to press the same button twice instead of 2 different buttons 
---
It was a bit of sarcasm. Most people who played understood that a set of dots from a warlock usually meant you're going to take about 80% of your HP if you dont deal with it in some way. Really common.
---
Watch this instead 
---
https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs
---
Its not a perfect solution, loot trading is dumb, but it at least mitigates it and adds some accountability to the master looter. If I were a GM and someone told me one of my members was abusing the system with some screenshots I would kick them immediately. Nobody wants to be "that guild", and good luck finding another when you're known as a ninja.
---
So, anyone who doesn't agree with the stance that you also agree with is ignorant or stupid. Looking past the person to the issue doesn't really change what you said. 
---
Solid, looking good. You got a pack to dld it?
---
Yikes, that's some real dedicated e-girl stuff. There was a video of a guy showing him con players, he was a human female I think, running BRD's etc, but then would casually drop lines in party chat etc or something like (not this but similar bait material) "ugh this bra is so uncomfortable" and sure enough would get a whisper or something. From there he just flirts and then waits for them to come on hard, asks for gold or casually drops how he's (she's) short some money for gear / mount, etc. Does this to like 3-4 people and gets like 500-1k gold... so I mean... 
---
Bunch of fat naked guys in their momma's basement, dancing as naked Nelf and Human females in Goldshire.
---
That is a Role Playing Server.
---
This is actually a pretty good idea. As long as the gear crafted had minimal impact on PvP, I dont see any problems. The meme specs will still be subpar, though. Sorry you're catching flak from the #nochangeseventhothegameisgoingtohavechanges crowd.
---
There's only certain talents (BM ones, ofc) and certain bonuses from gear (namely the 4-5 set bonuses of either T1, T2, T3 and the epic pieces of the D2 set) but all of these are quite minimal and not that great either. 
---
Damage-wise it is strictly T3 4-set bonus (50 ap to both pet and owner) and the D2 (beastmaster) boots and gloves (3% pet damage and 2% pet crit respectively).  Everything else are health/resist/armor bonuses.
---
Buffing as pally is way more boring than judging. Have more things to do is usually more engaging.

Check the comment section . I also tried to make it pretty obvious in the video itself that it was a joke . 'Gold making guide 100g an hour' even though its just me begging for gold using creative ways lol like come on bro  . I even put in the description that if the people i got the gold from are watching and want the gold back to message me , and if they dont message me ill just send the gold back to them after a couple of days .  Not to mention what i stated in the beggining of the video .

Will a Gnome jumping from the same height as a Tauren receive more damage because he has further to fall?
---
&gt; you needed on something it automatically bounded to you.
---
That was only applied to BoE items in Wrath or Cata, definitely wasn’t in Vanilla. 
---
Loot trading works like this: you roll whatever (need, greed, anything) and get an item, BoP or BoE. You have a 2h window where you can trade that item with the other players that could also roll on it. 
---
This means you can have someone need the item then pass it to their friends, which screws over other people that also needed the item. 
---
Class fantasy tied to armor types you CAN wear. It's still there, you're just intentionally misrepresenting it (because you only want to use arcanite reaper forever? I dont really understand the point you're trying to make)
---
When the game first launches, the same people who you're complaining about (is it people who min max?) will all be using arcanite reaper. Every single warrior worth a damn will have arcanite reaper. So this example you've made sucks. Further, there are fire specs that aoe farm faster than frost mages, and post bwl mages will be primarily specced fire.
---
Please educate yourself.
---
People are complaining about loot trading but don't seem to know what reserve runs are. 
---
we won't know as this will depend on hitboxes and how things are calculated. I think you'd find your answer to this by looking at modern wow as the engine and hitboxes will most likely closer resemble that than they did vanilla. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/o9KhYck.jpg
---
Too much I like minimalist personally.
---
It will not be vanilla, it will be classic wow and there are already changes confirmed. As i said in my post above it is about creating positve change and not deniing everything ending up with undiscussed changes creating anger and hate in the community.
---
Weapons can be completly gamechanging especially in PVP the impact is very high. New races and new classes have the same result. So it can not be compared to what i want to discuss about.
---
New mounts: As long as i can have my fun with the classic wow i do not now why it should bother me if there would be new ones. But that is just my opinion and you can have your own about it. I do not think they would negatively affect the game and i am pretty sure there will be new ones just because blizzard wants to earn their money.
---
The core of the game remains the same and that is what counts for me. I want to have that classic experience again and in my eyes denying every new idea although it does not affect you and your playstyle is very egoistic.
---
Blizzard will not manage to fit the game into everyones wishes that is for sure.
---
Loot trading was introduced in wrath and is still in the game. The way it works is whoever looted a BoP item has 2 hours to trade it to another player (I think the receiving player had to be in the group during the time of the boss kill?).
---
It's also possible the loot is generated for the raid/dungeon ID before the mobs die. 
---
This advice was sound when you only played with people on your server. You got to know who was an idiot and who was an idiot but was hilarious and so you brought them anyway.
---
Now that you’re unlikely to ever see anyone in your random group ever again there isn’t any penalty for acting rude or booting people.
---
yeah no ones interested in the scarab lord title or the mount...
---
Honestly 90 min full clear for a group of low level noobs in classic would be amazing. 
---
That's the upside to Vanilla communities. Im assuming there won't be paid server changes in Classic? 
---
Rofl salad bakers are a fucking joke. 
---
lol this is such a stupid argument
---
"i had to press 2 buttons instead of 1, uhhh yeah feel that satisfaction"
---
Changing stance triggers the GCD anyway, so speed isn't really a factor. It's basically either you bind each stance to a specific hotkey, or you macro stance-specific abilities to also switch stance, and then bind them separately (i.e. not on the main bar that switches).
---
I honestly don't think there's even a practical benefit to the macro. It doesn't save time, nor keybinds (in fact, it uses more keybinds). I wager that it's just a matter of being more intuitive, but that interpretation would simply differ per person.
---
Only 2 classes I didnt play during vanilla/BC/wrath, Shaman and druid.
---
Going with druid, never wanted to play a tauren so nelf it is on a PvP server. Telderassil/darkshore/ashenvale scenery is too nice any way. 
---
Lmao
---
are you saying the internet has no idea who Mr T, Chuck Norris and Verne Troyer is? especially during the time which these commercials came out.
---
Those two things are not connected to the war effort, those are from the scepter quest chain.
---
But thanks for the passive aggressive insult.
---
You'll have to browse the used market for good deals for a long time, but if you're determined and don't mind playing on low you can probably make it happen
---
The mr bean one didn’t make any sense lol wtf
---
Why are your health bars and casting bar gigantic? You have the "minimalist" aesthetic with elvui/whatever, but then cover half your screen with stuff, doesn't really work. 
---
any more concrete arguments? I just want to be sure to not have overseen something here
---
Okay gotcha I was confused because I have read multiple different posts on how it works shits so confusing. 
---
Not if you want to keep using your laptop. 
---
I like vanillas graphics and art style so much more than modern wow
---
There's like 3 scorpion spawns in the zone and they have about a 5% chance to drop that venom. Ah... Can't wait..

While I agree reserve runs are annoying I don' think they will ever stop in the PUG world fortunately I have a guild ready to go so I won't have to worry about it.

Different abilities are only available in certain stances. 
---
If you're Tanking mobs in Defensive Stance and suddenly someone pulls adds (from behind the group) you'll want to get there quickly. Intercept requires switching quick to Berserker Stance. Once there I'd want to quickly put a Thunderclap down so I'd switch to Battle Stance and do that, then switch back to Defensive.
---
There are a bunch more like this, like to avoid Fears with Berzerker Rage, use Sweeping Strikes with Whirlwind, etc.
---
Nice
---
Mentally ill to think that a record that was already set 13 years ago is going to be a race to set today. I'm sorry you don't get it, perhaps you should re read what I said before. THERE IS NO WORLD FIRST RACE.
---
I don't see why you're being downvoted. This will 100% happen in PuG raids.
---
Whats a good point! I will change a few things and will decrease the the height of everything. Thanks.
---
The Shatner one is pure gold. 
---
Alright let's just get this figured out. Where's the tank?
---
Should be on whelps
---
Ah and with life tap if the warlock had a pocket healer they were nearly unstoppable in pvp. fear and seduce things on the healer and dot up the rest.
---
Benediction. I always wanted one, I still do.
---
1) Roll a mage
---
2) Get good at being a mage
---
3) Get invited to raids
---
They'll take a good mage over a mediocre one any time.
---
It was also a good way to gain rep if I remember correctly.  My orc shaman with a kodo mount wasn’t nearly as unique afterwards.  So it does help some other parts of the community

---
Social norms can degrade to the point enough people are abusing the loot trading, it becomes acceptable. 
---
AQ20 and ZG would like to have a word with you.
---
I think people in this thread are misunderstanding the suggestion. Multiple people have said they would rather the devs make decisions rather than leaving it up to the community. But that doesn't really make sense. In the proposed OSRS idea, the devs are still the ones coming up with potential changes; it's just that the community has the chance to veto it.
---
I don't understand why someone would rather the devs make a change without asking us, than propose a change and let us potentially veto it, if the thing they are scared of is bad changes going through. The second scenario just has an extra safeguard to retain the purity of the game. It's not like the scenario with voting would have random nobodies coming up with an idea and then pushing it through, to the dismay of the devs who know better.

Actually they are very much related, if indirectly. The faster you finish the War Effort the less time other people have to finish the chain, thus making the mount rarer.

My only character in Vanilla (and TBC) was a Lock.  Farming shards is indeed a pain.  But other classes, like hunters who must buy arrows, also have to this to contend with - that’s just Vanilla - nothing is free in Vanilla. 
---
The thing to be aware of is that, not only must you always have shards in your bags and the bag space that is sacrificed to keep them, you can’t just farm shards anywhere.  Harvesting shards depends on a ratio between your level and the level of the mob.   The ideal ratio (highest drop rate) is a mob at the same level as you are.  But most dungeons are in zones that will be different from the level that you are at the time.  So, you may need to even take a flight path to a nearby zone just to farm shards or farm them on your way there. 
---
If you show up at a dungeon or raid and don’t have enough shards to summon everyone and make hearthstone and souls stone s (which you will always be expected to do), you can’t farm shards from mobs who are too far below or too far above your level.  I don’t recall what that ratio is exactly.  For example (and I’m making these numbers up), if you are level 60, you can’t farm shards off of a bunch of mobs who are much lower than you (let’s say lvl 40).  Conversely, if you are level 40, you can’t easily kill and farm shards off mobs who are much higher than you (say, lvl 45), primarily because it’s just hard to kill a mob that much higher lol.  But I think you get my point.  
---
I loved playing a Lock, though.  It wasn’t like harvesting shards was such a pain, that it wasn’t fun or with it - it was!  Everything in Vanilla that takes effort, gives you a reward - especially socially.  
---
People really loved having a Lock in the party because you saved them ~20 minutes getting to the dungeon or from having to walk ~10 minuets back through the dungeon after a wipe or, especially, summoning a replacement after someone had to leave or got disconnected in the middle of the run.   People loved locks for those reasons - and more! 
---
if anything, loot trading will encourage reserve runs 
---
&gt;thus making the mount rarer.
---
We're not talking about how rare it is.
---
Will there more likely to be a high demand for mages or warlocks?  It seems mages will be one of, if not the most populated classes. However, mages are very desirable in groups/raids for their CC, top tier DPS, and food/water.  Warlocks are less desired traditionally, but will this be offset by the lower population?
---
Other factor to consider is that it seems warlocks will be much more popular during classic than they were during vanilla. 
---
So what do you all think?  Will mages and warlocks have a comparable level of demand in groups and raids?  Or will one be more popular than the other. 
---
Pre-raid BIS just means "things you can get before entering raids".
---
You can get a raid-recipe-crafted item without entering a raid yourself.

No, we are talking about how interest in the mount correlates with interest in the War Effort.

I like it!
---
would you run it with VW's or Fel hunters?
---
I think its a simple fix, if Classic outpaces retail. An old god consumes Azeroth. You wake to Chromie's voice: "perhaps this timeline..."
---
No need to re-do TBC on.
---
Who are "we"?
---
I’ve never heard of this so I’m no expert- but I’d imagine anyone would still know based on your resource (energy vs rage vs mana)
---
The PVP is why it's so iconic though.
---
You can hit exalted with darnassus at Level 38 as human. Just run over to the nightelf starting zone and make your way from there. 
---
You only get the Full amount of rep if the quests aren’t grey so you gotta Start questing there from level 1. 
---
no, i'm saying neither the celebrities in question, nor the brain trust writing the advertisements, had any idea what WoW was or what the people who played it were like.
---
I did not feel like the commercials did a good job representing the game or the player base.  I was, and still am, embarrassed by these commercials.
---
I admit i've gone through some of nyhms old songs too recently.
---
Mods were always a part of Vanilla WoW.
---
I love playing this game. Time spec for mages (healing through reversing damage?), earthwarder/tank for shaman, lich/caster spec for DK... Any others?
---
I saw a 0/30/21 spec mentioned for resto Druid that went far enough to get 5/5 Heart of the Wild.  Can a spec like that also tank the later 5 mans and ubrs with proper tank gear from the prior dungeons and quest rewards?
---
I'm really hoping that a spec like that will let me Tank and Heal for groups.  I'm going resto for raiding but will enjoy getting to tank without respecing when my friends I and can't find another tank.
---
40+ bank alts isn't exactly a big number, considering that that's the minimum number of members a raiding guild has. 40+ bank alts means one alt per raider. A guild that is determined to blaze through the raids as fast as possible to get the world 'first' kill would definitely be able to do that.
---
Warriors benefit the most from farming high value professions over mob farming. Otherwise tanking strath living and reserving a righteous orb is a decent way to make some gold. I preferred herb/alch over blacksmithing because potions last a much shorter time than gear does, so you constantly have demand.
---
They'll both be very desired, ranged DPS always is, and they both bring great group buffs and unique CC.
---
Mages tend to be slightly more desired since they have a hard CC of Poly, Portals, and healer's best friend - free water. 
---
Warlocks tend to be less played in general, like with Druids, in raids you there tend to be only a handful of each. And since Rolling Ignites is a thing, most guilds will bring enough locks just for the full curse regimen and fill the rest of their cloth DPS with Mages.
---
We don't even know the ins and outs of blizzards complete plan for it or any modifications.
---
For all we know it could be raid only - yes people are right to raise concerns but to act like the sky is falling in because they make up their own idea of it in their own head is crazy.
---
This wasn't my RP server experience back in retail Vanilla.
---
The biggest difference is if you do something cheeky, maybe make some joke or use some flowery language, people play along or don't act like you're weird. 
---
Also people aren't talking about Chuck Norris or whatever in general chat as much, it's about the game. You can just RP now and again in chat and people play along or don't act like you're weird. You're all *roleplaying*.
---
It's not like everyone was a tight ass insisting you use their pronouns or whatever. It was laid back but fun, and definitely the RP vein ran through the entire server.
---
I have so many stories from those days - it all really stuck with me.
---
So much so that if they don't make an RPPvP server (both aspects a personal must have) I won't be playing Classic.
---
Make sure she goes wand spec for leveling :)
---
I've done some basic math about speed gained from dynamite vs time lost getting bombs.
---
- Mining gets 2 hits at 3.2 sec apiece, with 1.5 stones (of whatever quality) per mine, give or take.
---
- 2.1 seconds lost per stone.
---
- 1 stone per blasting powder, so 2.1 seconds per blasting powder.
---
- Using low mid level as an example. Heavy Dynamite requires 2 coarse blasting powder and 1 wool cloth.
---
- So 4.2 seconds of mining per dynamite craft
---
- Dynamite craft creates 1-5 dynamite per craft, let's assume 2.5 (got higher on my tests, but let's go norm)
---
- 4.2 seconds of mining creates 2.5 dynamite.
---
- 1.68 seconds per dynamite.
---
My methods for dynamite aren't a general supplement for damage (unless stock is high) dynamite = burst damage on 2 mobs in case I pull an extra. Heavy dynamite does 150 damage, so x2, it does 300 damage when I pull 2.
---
From levels 25-35 when I might be using it, I expect to be putting out 40-60 DPS, so dynamite saves 7.5 - 5 seconds per use vs my normal autoattack.
---
Each dynamite use saves 3.32 seconds. Full 5 - 7.5 seconds if I buy the stones.
---
Other benefits from Engineering notwithstanding, it's faster for shit leveling classes.
---

---
Stances aren't on the gcd
---
If loot trading is in the game i'm most likely going to abuse it within reason. It might end up being you and your friends vs someone else and their friends loot battles.
---
 I guess you can inspect people and see if they actually need/equip the loot and then insta leave a group if there is loot trading going on. With close knit enough communities and doing guild runs it might not be as big of an issue as people think.
---
Yeah, I thought when you zoned into an instance was when the drops were populated
---
Says the guy spreading tipsout garbage as if it was fact.
---
Only 9 classes were available per faction.... 
---
Man I'll never forget how cool "Honor Kills" would make me feel back in the day.
---
Didn't they confirm it that there will be no addons because of the new client? It'd be so good to do quests without questhelper but it doesn't really bother me because I almost know every single quest in horde from 1 to 60.
---
I think a big part of vanilla raiding is the aspect of each class bringing a specialized role to the raid. For the 3 classes capable of healing on each faction, that means bringing heals and the rest of your support kit in 90% of situations.
---
There's still exceptions. With 16 debuff slots, I think we'll see a shadow priest in the raid for shadowweaving to buff warlocks. In MC and BWL, a geared Enh shaman with Nightfall would bring improved melee totems to the melee group while periodically buffing caster dps by 15%. That's possibly just 2 spots out of 40 though, and there probably isn't room for much else.
---
40+, emphasis on the +. Across both factions, too.
---
Even so, on recent private servers the war effort still took 2-3 weeks to complete, so I highly doubt a retail server with much lower player cap could possibly do it "in one day" like everyone is doomsaying.
---
Warcraft has a good art style though. You mention consoles but WoW is PC. This means that even with exact 1.12 graphics, we can render higher resolutions (modern WoW allows you to render at 4K on a 1080 monitor), more AA, etc. 1.12 pserver looks pretty nice on modern hardware. If Blizzard does do some kind of graphics overhaul (or even just some kind of update) I dont think this will be a big concern.
---
There's a few places in the game with passive ghost mobs. You can aggro them by casting an AoE spell, or see them by using 'detect invisibility' effects such as one from a potion or the warlock detect invisibility spell.

---
I think they release new addons, since I someone here at reddit said the old other addons will not work anymore.
---
New Addons = Alot improvment, like Weakauras 2 and stuff.
---
Probably won't be on day 1 but there will be within a week.
---
Oh I thought that was the same patch my bad
---
If you're basing this off of private server values I believe it's known that the rep values on quest rewards are way off. 
---
I personally don't remember seeing anyone under level 60 with off-faction mounts in vanilla.
---
Lmfao at all the people who can't accept that cloth is pre-raid BiS for their class -- it's just like 2004 vanilla you guys!
---
The mullet man poster killed me. 
---
Spooky
---
There's a difference between "interested in scarab lord and mount" and "finishing war effort super fast".
---
And I think onyxia scale cloak is a money maker or way to help get into guilds if you can make them.
---
Yes you can easily tank and heal everything including UBRS as that spec. It's the perfect spec if you want to do both.
---
Yea but some servers got to ring the gong in wotlk. So it means not every server opened the gates.
---
Let's hope they dont nerf the instant respawn in westfall of defias mobs to help farm linen
---
Probably all the ClassicWow players who identify with girls who have huge boobs. You know, sisterly support.  
---
I can't imagine any other reason.
---
People are comparing loot trading to reserve runs while being completely oblivious to the fact that you know X item is reserved from the start while you can't know if loot trading will be abused.
---
Terrible. As if the giant blocks of unit frames and cast bar weren't bad enough, but then you just plop target of target in there like an afterthought.
---

---
If minmaxers aren't doing this to maximize their gold income then they're not truly dedicated.
---
It was a thing, but as far as I remember only noggerfogger prevented revealing your form.
---
I can’t see them going crazy with the marketing and neither do I think they have to. The buzz is already pretty high and we’re still months from release, awesome ads though! 
---
It's 8GB GDDR5 @ 10Gb/s vs 6GB GDDR6 @ 14Gb/s. In terms of benchmarking/fps the 2060 is essentially equivalent to a 1080 but will underperform a 1080 Ti by  \~10%. Given that card costs more than twice as much though, I'm not seeing the value. In fact you can get a new RTX 2080 for less than a new GTX 1080 Ti and there is no competition between them. As for refurbished, I'd have genuine concerns about getting a card that may have been coin-mining 24/7 for years.

Also, in terms of future-proofing, the RTX 20xx series has the new Raytracing Cores that some game might make good use of at some point and a USB C slot for VR Headsets and the like, again possibly useful at some point. No sense in paying more not to have them though.

I’ve started working on a step-by-step quest completionist guide for Alliance Rogues, which should still be useful for other classes as well (minus their class-specific quests):
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
Just because someone plays differently than you doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing. This is their way of “just playing the game” 
---
Is it even possible that classic wow has unknown quests? Especially if they wont add any new ones.
---
By chiken quest you mean the pentagram kids? 
---
I think shifting with only Deviate Delights would remove the deviate delight buff, whereas shifting with a noggenfogger would keep the buff active (not removing it on the shift).
---
Ww's for pvp security and masspulls. But i suppose u can any thing with WW +
---
&gt;and a friend
---
Seriously, it's one sentence. Read the whole thing. 
---
I would assume you’d still want imp drain soul. Just multi pull and drain different mobs 
---
aoe lvling you want just int and stam only in that order
---
for single target and questing go with spell power, spirit, int, stam in that order.
---
Spell power increases your MPDE (mana per damage efficiency). I havent formally tested it but I leveled a mage recently who had around 130 or 140 spell power in his upper 30's and he could pyro for close to 1k IIRC. He could 2 shot on level players with crits. I have a hard time thinking spirit increases efficiency more than that.
---
not sure, maybe the devs of the addons could use the gameversion of the demo...
---
True, there was another post in here who later that said loot should only be tradeable with the master looter, so that the master looter is solely complicit with that kind of scumbaggery.
---
you need like 3 pieces and alliance get that sweet staff.
---
Hi, /u/314159265358979326
---
Cool :D Played on Defias Brotherhood during TBC, Great seeverN
---
I assume he's talking about the chicken quest on westfall. You do the /chicken emote on a chicken critter enough times and it gives you a pet chicken.
---
Dress up game? I'm gonna have to hit you with a ticket for being hella ghey, my dude.
---
You basically make a story for your character. Like something I liked was when I role played on Cenarion Circle I was a hunter that a toy that my son had given me. He went off to war and has been missing. I lost my sons gift in Stranglethorn Vale so I would slaughter everything in stv. People would say they heard the tale of my son and how tragic it was and an adventure would ensue. 
---
There’s other forms like combat where you would /roll to determine if you win the battle or something. But that’s just my story I made when I was a kid. Grinded the fuck out of stv though I was there from level 28 to like 46 lol
---
What would be the thing to farm as a warrior/shaman combination at 60?
---
Maraudon?  That place mages go to AOE?  I guess when DM comes out?
---
That kind of disregards the open world mob loot tables drops though. I don't see why they'd be different.
---
In classic, shapeshifting cancelled any appearance buff. I remember as a druid being sad I could never really take advantage of deviate delights.
---
&gt;Also, debuffs were rotating on horsemen since raid rotates around, have you ever done this boss in retail and not kiddie broken private servers?
---
That's utterly irrelevant to my point. Which is that the only reason you did competitive dps is because your guild's dps were nubs. As demonstrated by the debuffs or lack thereof being put on the bosses.
---
The fact that your guild could kill KT with such sub-optimal tactics just proves that it wasn't that hard. My guild got a fair way into Naxx, and most of our dps were either mediocre, or keyboard-turning scrubs.
---
Pretty awful if I’m honest
---
But all that matters is if you like it.
---
Oof. It wasn’t even that good in the first place.
---
This is not news. Don't you think I looked this up? Show me suiting plate boots pls. 
---
And 4mp/5 vs 22 heal +stats isn't that great, although for RP purposes it is better than an offhand frill. 
---
the /s is supposed to denote sarcasm
---
its a nice detail. i love it. 
---
Ah got you. Do you know how the spec fares in PvP?
---
IIRC vanilla database says something different. 
---
I don’t think the values are off, they may differ a bit but you could definitely hit exalted with darnassus before you hit 60. there are Just so many quests 
---
*Wooo* It's your **5th Cakeday** jaredletosombrehair! ^(hug)
---
Supposedly you can also hear Tyr's heatbeat thus Tyrisfall Glades
---
But ONLY if you have that piece of gear at the same ilvl or higher, which in classics case would just be regular level. Correct me if I'm wrong
---
How it should be vanilla if the video starts from Burning Crusade dungeons?
---
I love this man's hatred of dumb players, he is a hero.
---
china nr. 1!
---
pretty much. same with imp voidwalker. you just pull separate mobs when possible.
---
guys do you remember old chain lighting sound? 
---
Good point, also you can WIN the roll while in a reserve run... 
---
There's only one spellpower enchant in vanilla, or two if you count the specific +frost/fire/shadow on gloves. +50 isn't really that impactful.
---
If anyone is wondering. The Mr Bean one is fake

YouTube alone have more reach than the entire TV station in the world combined. Add in the other big platforms (Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, FB) and the forums (Reddit, MMOChamp, Official forums) and there is NO REASON WHATSOEVER for Blizzard to buy commercial time on TV stations.
---
The community does it FOR FREE.
---
Bad. Way to big and clunky
---
I am curious what is guild turnover rates were with leadership like that.
---
You can 2 run DM:E. One of you has to have Mining. If you have Enchanting and/or Herbing that's a huge bonus.
---
I'm almost completely certain that you couldn't get ZG enchants on BoE twink items. I can't remember the specifics, but I definitely don't remember that.
---
Holy shit I just remembered stream sniping... I can't wait to camp them til they log off
---
It's not an rp set since you are actually using it for main specc.
---
And even though I agree this might not be a BiS set from what the game offers it is BiS for my goal to build a gear set that gives you another choice than running around in a dress. 
---
I thought maybe that.  What about before DM comes out?
---
Yes it did.
---
Furthermore, here's Ion's full quote from Blizzcon:
---
Ion's quote at Blizzcon:
---
&gt; “[Loot Trading] was added to solve a common problem that existed back in Classic where if you accidentally looted an item that someone else meant to get—or maybe you master looted to the wrong person—you could open a CS support ticket and say “I didn’t mean to loot this, I’d like to give it to so and so,” and it would take a four or five day turnaround time, but CS would generally help you out with that problem and transfer the item.
---
&gt; This is the case where **we’re keeping loot trading in because the end result is the same. We’re saving you a four or five day wait, but we’re also freeing CS to focus on other player issues.**”
---
Amazing 
---
OILF
---
Hmm probably farming Ungoro for Elemental Fire and RTVs. There aren't any good instanced farming spots before that.
---
It depends heavily on what's shown after the BC dungeons. 
---
Man, so much more "fucking" in this one.
---
But the Ony one is much better:), even with less "fucking".
---
Idk man, you make content for the community, troll, berate... like, what's your angle here?
---
Is this a meme like the xbox 360? 
---
The git gud mentality has always been around, but people just arent interested in helping. And many people are jaded to advice because they assume you're coming from a condescending position.
---
It's just a game. 
---
Oh yeah you know shit's going down when everyone is RP walking, sometimes I would just follow along in stealth to see what would happen.
---
Probably over 100%.
---
I used to lead, and while not using more than 2-3 "fucking" during a bad attempt, I always had 50+ peoplke showing for raids.
---
That is literally the complete opposite of under the radar.  You're actually drawing attention to the thing intentionally.
---
Just find a fun guild and the game guides you up to 20. Although if your alliance and find early west fall hard doing some quest in the dwarf starting area helps you get over the rough part of being lvl 11 in west fall. If you need advice helpful players will be more than happy to give advice. 
---
Pick up skinning and grind Swamp of Sorrows. The leather vendors really well. Secondly, there will be people putting up stuff on the AH below vendor price so you might want to check on that as well!
---
Damn. This is a funny joke. I wonder who made it? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔(It’s me)
---
700 was the best it ever was, it used isdn as an upload....it was alot over 1500 ping....
---
To be honest I didn't know that clip was so early on. But that makes a lot of sense now. 
---
The Ozzy one is the best imho.
---
50 Spellpower on lvl 29 is huge man there were not so many other ways to stack it, but that should not be part of this post ;) enchants will not get an itemlvlrestriction in classic anway because it would be not blizzlike
---
i played a lot as a rouge and as a warrior in 29 pvp and i can say for my part this enchants made the difference between diing from being kitet and destroy the clothies
---
Mana was very limited in Pvp fights and therefore the +dmg was necessary, burst was very important
---
You have no idea the dev time it would take, it could be as simple as spawning a 2 hour chest with the same ID as the boss, blizzard has already said it wants to invest dev time anyways. This is another bad excuse nochangers use to avoid the argument.
---
Those hands are cloth.
---
No you can't. Loot master baby.
---
Whatever you prefer to imagine.  But, I wouldn't go sharing you fantasies with all of Reddit.  Pretty gross.
---
The AH comes alive surprisingly fast, but yeah, I expect to have to grind at a few points. Finding mobs who drop high-value greys, and if possible comboing with skinning, works pretty well.
---
Extremely high.
---
I have only had one very angry guild leader during my time in WoW. That guy screamed just like this(even though this is more fun in comparison) and he was an actual skinhead in real life aswell. It was on Outland EU during the Cata days if someone here remembers, he had a reputation on the realm as that "racist and extremely angry guy" by literally most of the realm (and Outland is one of the largest on the EU side). I'm pretty sure he was banned just before Panda got released though.
---
Either way, I was new to the realm and just got to 85 when I saw him recruiting more members.. so I joined him. I later found out that people left the guild both during and after raiding hours because he was such a raging douche, but I decided to try raiding with the guild once just to see if it was true and holy shit it was true. He screamed like a maniac, called everyone the n-word and retarded, kicked an officer mid-raid, etc etc. So I just left the guild and hearthstoned.
---
Some people man..
---
I’m a Priest and I shield a warrior in a dungeon am I reducing his threat? Also, does casting shield increase my threat either?
---
&gt; Secondly, there will be people putting up stuff on the AH below vendor price
---
I keep seeing people mention this, but I don't understand why.  Why would people list stuff lower than they could just vendor it for?  Do people really just pay that little attention?
---
No, whose the tank. Where's the mage.
---
Yeah but if they go with loot trading there won't be master loot? 
---
So some of these well known spots, are they not heavily farmed and make it a nightmare??
---
big, if true
---
Rock dudes in Badlands will get you to your 90g pretty quickly. 
---
I'm not saying we need loot trading. I'm just saying the problem is just going to go by another name.
---
Try /r/wow       
---
This sub is for Classic wow coming this summer.
---
I posted this here primarily because I was comparing several aspects of Classic to the current game. 
---
Yes
---
Surprisingly, yes people really don't know the value of their items.
---
Occasionally  I would sell things basically free if it was a nice useful item for leveling but of no significant value.  For example shoulders for lv16 with no stats.
---
Plate would likely help you not die quickly when attacked by physical dps and would help incase the paladin pulls aggro. Not to mention a lot of that plate has some dps stats which is nice if the paladin wants to assist the dps.
---
If you're talking STRICTLY raiding though, you're correct; yes.
---
Have you got any good ideas as to places to grind? 
---
Sorry to let you know but that happened over 12 years ago
---
Playing a warrior with these stance dance/abillity usage macros basically invalidates the main mechanic of the warrior.
---
The basilisks (saltstone gazers and crystalhides) clustered around the southern end of the shimmering flats are pretty great. Good vendor loot, about 5s average per kill. But more importantly most of them are perfectly spaced barely apart so that there's almost no travel time between mobs but they aggro solo. Also the crystalhides are caster mobs so they have about 80% of the hp and armor of typical enemies making them quick kills. Very efficient grinding.
---
Unless your in Australia.
---
What is the vendor item that they drop thats so valuable? What is their level and do you know the rough location?
---
You don't see the vendor price without an addon. Some items like a star rubin is worth 1g when you sell it to a vendor. During classic I have seen a lot of people who sold it for like 50s in the AH. They simply didn't know better and most people don't run to a vendor first to check all prices for an item.
---
The only thing that happens is DPS warriors, hunters and every non-cloth healer gets gimped.
---
Expected an Asmongold video.
---
its so zoomed out it looks like runescape xD
---
Asmongold does have a small cameo in here, actually! It's one of his prouder moments (4HEad slam)
---
Good lock with farming that mob... it's a zone full of ganker like stv
---
Beast specs tend to be better in PvP earlier on in the server when nobody is geared out.  Beasts can take down equal lvl players while lvling singlehandedly with beastial wrath and the stun.  
---
Later on when people have more gear/armor, the ZG windserpant with rank six lightning breath can get past the extra armor everyone has by patch 1.7.
---
&gt; assuming you're allowing that on your list
---
Vanilla Druid here, can confirm the Noggenfogger not showing which form. Meaning you'd stay a skeleton. Animatioins like Maul looked like normal, however.
---
Heavily Heavily contested! Of all the places other than STV and Hillsbrad that I am fearful of come Classic Release! this place is gorey!
---
No, there won't be tokens in classic. It's very bad for the economy, as gold is much more relevant in classic than retail. 
---
Buying gold for real money shouldnt be a thing. I know there will be people trying to sell gold, but blizzard will hopefully put a stop to many of them. 
---
No, PWS definitely generates threat for the caster, but less threat than heal healing for the equivalent amount of damage absorbed would.
---
Not BoEs, but items that don't bind at all.
---
not trying to be a dick but these seem like theyre all trying to be generic edgy guild names. 
---
I'm in no real rush to get my mount. So it takes me a few minutes extra to get somewhere. I'd rather focus on my gear first and then work on saving up afterwards. But that's just me.
---
and you think that wasn't what i was going for?
---
Sure, I mean as a Druid player I can't say that its the end of the world, but its certainly something useful to have, especuially on a fresh realm to get ahead of other people!
---
We had a guild leader that could "blow up" like this guy. We were a naxx clear guild (barely before TBC.) I attribute him to the reason. He was so chill most of the time, but sometimes he would straight lose his shit. Usually after he did, the next few attempts were our best.
---
My brother was raiding MC next to me. We would just bust out laughing when he'd start cutting into people.
---
Note: We had very little turnover. Everyone loved the balance of quiet, calm raiding with "wake the fuck up." This was also probably because we were more at the hardcore end of the spectrum though raiding 4-5 nights a week.
---
I think those were always there it was just a matter of graphic settings 
---
Correct. The person had to be there and be eligible for the loot to get it. As i recall the same arguments happened for wrath too talking about how people would ninja loot. Then again wrath threw more trash loot at people and was easy as fuck.
---
This is one of those technical things i dont have much hope for change. Then again i also dont care as much about it either.
---
I came here to link your video but I see somebody else already has. Thanks for the videos their hilarious
---
I made a character on a RP server one time. I ran into a Tauren named Kreelith in Org and he invited me to his guild.
---
His guild was called Crab People and he would say about every 10 minutes "Crab People, Crab People looks like Crab tastes like People".  Everyone had the toy from legion that turned you into a lobster. He called for a guild meeting in Org and everyone showed up. He told us that he would turn us into Gods. Keep in mind we are a complete range of toons. I was level 15 lots around level 50s and a couple 120s Kreelith being one of them. After he gave his speach about him being a god and how we could ascend to a god like him he demanded that we play rated battlegrounds. That was the last i heard of him. Kreelith if you're out there buddy you made my night!
---
They didnt say they were removing ML just adding in some feature to make sure that people dont submit tickets for loot as they look to lower the total number of GMs on staff and use more automated systems.
---
This is clearly against the #nochanges guys.. Just leave it like it is. Its gonna take a good ammount of time. Just read the above item requirements, and you will see its not as easy as OP makes it out to be. 
---
So it was actually possible to put a ZG enchant on a white item?
---
Nothing is better than standing outside gadg as a skelly when im really in bear form. The faces when i can heal myself too as a skelly. Can confirm noggen is the best
---
I never said they were equivalent. Just that shamans are still a preferred and often stacked healer horde side. Whereas druids are still only a couple per raid.
---
Is skinning really worth it though?
---
Swamp Jaguars in particular, which are the most popular in the SoS pre-40 grind.
---
They drop Thick Leather 20% of the time, Heavy Leather 80% - vendor price of 3 and 1.5s --- or 1.8s average silver per mob, or 0.6 silver per second spent skinning.
---
In this range, you should be able to kill a mob in about 15 seconds. So if the mobs drop &gt; 9s per kill, it's better to just kill and loot vs taking the time to skin.
---
Between their Long Soft Tails (8s 6c - 60% drop) Large Fangs (.75s - 20% drop) and Bristly Whiskers (7s 33c - 20% drop) - they drop about 8.5s per kill (at 1.5 drops per kill)
---
So is it worth it to spend 35+ levels leveling up skinning for 50 extra copper per kill? You'll likely have killed 2,000 mobs between 1-35, skinning half of those means 1,000 skinned, at 3 seconds apiece, that's 50 minutes wasted skinning.
---
If you had skipped skinning, you would have gotten to SoS 50 minutes earlier. Spending that 50 minutes grinding instead would net you 10g or so.
---
That leather you spent the last 35 levels wasting time skinning won't be worth 10+ gold (1000 skins, averaging at light leather / medium leather @ 0.15s / 0.5s - you're looking at 3 gold.
---
Skinning is a waste of time. Use that time to kill more and vendor their shit.
---
During leveling 40+ is just OP. At 60 it still fares well enough until you get a strong enough ranged weapon and/or enemies get more gear (specially clothies) and the no-longer-scaling damage becomes less important. 
---
But even then one of the preferred PvP builds is BM-based (intimidation/scatter shot) and the pet is still quite a nuisance to casters (due to pushback) specially if using broken tooth or another fast attacking pet.
---
No, that is a fact. It did not exist, GMs would NOT just endlessly fix loot for you. You would get MAYBE 3 and it would take forever. I’ve seen some people trade 3 pieces of loot in the same dungeon/raid in the newer system. 
---
Loot trading was not introduced until WOTLK, and people trying to argue that are the worst kind of toxic. 
---
heres a simple question:
---
can people stop making 120 threads a day about loot trading? its pretty annoying!
---
thanks! :)
---
I really dont think that someone that shat in diapers when WoW came, can give opinion into this case.
---
Hi r/classicwow!

I'm interested in joining a group/guild of people who are looking to enjoy classic as much as I do. Not only at the destination of hitting end-game, but as well as the journey of the leveling grind. I started wow the last two weeks of vanilla and TBC was the expansion I spent the most most time on and I feel being part of a community and having main group of friends was the main reason. Since wotlk, I haven't ever really felt the same feeling in wow. I feel classic is the perfect opportunity for this.
---
I will be rolling on Alliance PvP(/RP-PvP) for certain. I would be flexible in my class choice between a Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue (preference in that order). I haven't really been in any sort of even "semi" hardcore raiding environment since tbc, but I feel like with recent changes in my life I'll have the time to finally return to that type of commitment and look forward to playing my part in a team. Ultimately in classic, my goal is to both enjoy everything the game has to offer while trying to be the best player I can be. 
---
My available raid times would be any day of the week (Mon-Sun) 9 pm - 1 am CST OR (Sun-Tue) Anytime of the day.  
---
Thanks for reading. hmu on discord skarvon#0773
---
1 am CDT happens when this comment is 11 hours and 16 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/KSTNC0VpV
---
Hell yeah. This will be my first priest. I'd love to get benediction too.
---
I don't think any new builds would happen because of this, it would just mean warriors lose like 50% of their pre bis gear.
---
Thanks so much, been looking for this for a while.
---
No gankers on PVE.
---
To each their own :)
---
Anyone can give an opinion into this case so long as they know what happened. I understand what's lacking today that so many people enjoyed back then. Scientifically and business-wise, there's a lot of understanding that needs to go into it.
---
People who've actually experienced Vanilla WoW do have top priority in terms of opinion, but I still think I can share how I feel.
---
Yeah, I think every1 just remembers the end, not the struggle.
---
I believe STV has some of the best grey drops, but perhaps not the best on a PvP server. Honestly, you're best finding an area you like hanging out, and preferably one no-one else bothers with.
---
I believe so, not 100% sure though.
---
That's where I first noticed then too 
---
Do you remember if deviate delights work the same way?
---
No. Dataminers know every quest in the game. 
---
This is Classic, this isn't vanilla. There is a word first race on Classic servers. You're dumb af mate. 
---
&gt; I'm fucking THIRTY NINE DEGREES TEMPERATURE!
---
It’s basically showcasing one of the dances in the game
---
One of the dances in game
---
For what race
---
Hybrids (except warrior) do less than half the dps of pure dps classes. That isn't simply not-optimal, it's absolute thrash and it's demotivating to play one of those specs. If someone in our raid in wotlk was doing less than half of the other dps, they would only be invited into the next raid if we didn't have anyone else to invite
---
So you settle for garbage dps and HOPE your raid leader does this favor for you... you probably wont be having fun doing it. I know I wouldn't, being a burden who is getting out-dpsed by the tank. But hey I'm giving warlocks more damage, so I guess it's fun? xD
---
This may have worked back then, when people would be more invested in the game they played. Now, if I'm not really liking a game I'll just change the game because there are so many more games to choose from nowadays. Just play league, fornite/apex/whatever, bfa, wotlk pservers... once people reach 60 and want to do the ACTUAL end game, they'll experience this and definetly not like it. Then I'll wish good luck to blizzard if they stick to #nochanges
---
This. Is stupid. While neither you nor OP are technically wrong about high end vs low end communication, your hand-wave bs is pretty stupid. Imagine trying to use this to sell WoW to new players "yeah this game is amazing. Its a huge open world with tons of other people you can do stuff in. Dont worry about them though, you'll spend your first few hundred hours playing essentially alone in silence until you hit 120 and get geared. It's only if you play this game like a part time job that you'll start actually talking to people"
---
What stupid logic. The reason people complain, and the reason there's such a big difference between retail and vanilla is that the SYSTEMS in vanilla forced players to communicate with each other (profs, dungeons, raids, epic/elite quests, world PvP/lowbie ganks), whereas in retail, the only time players talk is when the difficulty of the CONTENT forces them to. That's a huge difference. The actual communication is way different too. In vanilla, you have to talk to form the group. But then your 30 minutes from the dungeon with only running ahead so you and the group start talking about random shit. That's how you make friends. On the flip side, in retail, nobody outside of guild discords just shoots the shit. The only time people talk are when dorectly discussing the content at hand. People talk mechanics and loot and thats about it.
---
Yeah, there were def some out there.  
---
The description in his eponymous movie cracks me up: "I even kill a shaman at one point. " Hahahaha!
---
No way, and I hope it doesn’t lol. 
---
Hmm, interesting. That would be insanely powerful in the lower twink brackets.
---
I don't ever recall seeing or hearing about it being done though.
---
I hope it won‘t be available. At least for the first months when it would give an unfair advantage over all other players. At a later point it‘s still unfair but tbh I wouldn‘t care then. 
---
Literally just farm any mob with decent trash drops, tigers and panthers in STV/Swamp, anything skinnable in desolace and shimmering flats drops well. I had 90g on my hunter when I dinged 40 on a recent pserver, I did like 1 hour of stv tiger grinding (I was one of the first in the zone), 2-3 hours of farming in deso and finishing off about 1 hour in swamp to hit 40 and have gold for it. I did all this in very fast /played (I recall lvl 35 with 35h played) with no issues at all. 
---
I’m researching it more and learned it generates threat when you cast it, not when it absorbs damage.  So casting it before the fight won’t generate threat to you.  That was the situation I had in my mind.
---
I sure hope not. Big part of the classic experience is the journey of leveling, IMO
---
2 warlocks could just wand everything to death while void tanks
---
Shouldn't have had music.
---
&gt;Main reason is because i'm testing on my paladin without any buffs other than bow (can't get into raids or dungeons as dps lol)
---
Anyone else notice the female night elf at the beginning with her arms stuck up like she just casted? Was this an old bug?
---
No why's the mage. Where is the healer.
---
Skinning isn't a waste of time. Thick leather constantly auctions for 6 silver each because it is worth a little more than 7 silver each when crafted into nightscape tunics and vendored. Same thing with rugged leather, can auction it for 6 silver no problem.
---
Skinning beasts level 45+ takes 3 seconds for 6 silver, which is the equivalent of 72 gold per hour.
---
Skinning beasts around swamp jaguar's level is 2.4 silver average which is about 29 gold per hour. While that doesn't compete with the best 60 farm methods it is fantastic for a leveler who needs the money now.
---

---
You answered yourself, its pretty much impossible to reach 100g if you are buying all of your spells. On the other hand, if you are picky about them, its not hard at all. Quite an easy trick to make your life easier
---
Warriors need rage for threat, and Shields reduce the ability to gain rage from being hit, so yes. It's great for emergencies, but otherwise there's better tank healing spells like simple Heal-capped-Renew where you allow yourself the maximum time outside the 5sr.
---
Casting Shield causes threat to you when cast, so if you plan on having some Mage/Lock AOEing it can be useful to pre-shield before the pull.
---
As a druid though, other than Starfire and Wrath Post level 20... alot of your spells are good and useful. I think anyways!
---
Voluminous if positive
---
Also the bazilisks are quest mobs. Wouldnt really recommend on a crowded realms
---
So I watched half the video, I'll finish the rest when I have time.  But so far, your ideas sound good to me as a vanilla player but from what I've seen would not be for retail players.
---
Exhibit A: Hunter pets were changed to be a little more like classic again.  Massive outage, Hunters quitting their class, Asmongold losing his shit - massive article explaining the problems with adding classic concepts to retail - "What's next hunter ammo again? Reee"
---
Exhibit B: Portals get removed, now you must interact with Mages to get them.  Everyone loses their god damn minds.
---
I also don't think you can just make raids meaningful again.  You take away a casual experience or condense a hard core experience and then you've in some way devalued someone elses achievement or ruined their fun.
---
Sure us classic folks like the idea of you either beat a boss or you didn't.  But, it doesn't translate to retail be of the above mentioned.  So you make some changes and you make us (the minority) happy and piss off the main players base.  I think Blizzard is damned if they do, damned if they don't.
---
How did they handle launching new servers back in Vanilla? Like did they do anything to make competition in starter areas managable or was it just a clusterfuck?
---
Those few extra minutes start adding up real fast. It's an investment that is heavily worth it
---
I can do 250-300 dps without using Conc and going OOM (judgement of wisdom on boss.. most would allow that)mayb conc spam with pot buffs.. every piece of gear had +crit% other than the hit requirements so I had veng constantly (human so a free 3% with mace + 3% talent).. Arcanite Reaper did less DPS than that 2 hand mace with 2% crit with 3.90 speed (it's like a weaker unstoppable force you get in a lootbag)  
---
Honestly if what you're saying is true then I'm happy with the result.. but I no they start to suck as people progress so i'm only testing pre bis gear nothing more!
---
You don know shit you little kid. You really think it was hard to dps? Most classes had a 1-2 button rotation you dunce. And my entire guild by naxx had spent thousands of hours raiding. There was also 2 well known people in guild you would likely know, one of them being hulksmash orc warrior. 
---
Your going to call my guild noobs for a debuff you don’t approve of.  
---
I’m assuming your going to roll warrior on classic right? My goal in classic is to make it a nightmare for all warriors to level since all you pservers kids are going warrior due to how broken they are on pservers.
---
Spooky AF
---
Yeah it’s not getting better as content advances but at least you can do MC easily 
---
It was first introduced in burning crusade. It definitely will not be present in the launch and probably will never be introduced, nor should it. 
---
&gt;  don't RP themselves but think it's more immersive to be around those who do
---
This is why I played on moon guard. It was cool seeing a lot of different things in the game that don't exist. I remember seeing a bunch of people in stormwind guard gear doing fighting drills.
---
seeing random events or ceremonies or whatever made it not so boring and feel like the same thing every day
---
I went looking around and blizzard doesn't seem to have ever commented on this but the consensus from some programmer's thoughts would be: Mob dies, runs script, pulls loot from table #XXXX. So thus populates the loot upon the death of the mob. As you suggested. But without blizz commenting its a bit of a who knows. 
---
TYVM
---
Why not just use the Furbolg Rod instead ?
---
Basically a clusterfuck, but you have to remember there was never a simultaneous online launch like we will have with Classic. The only way to get it originally was buying a box so there was a strict controlled amount that could log in day 1, and then from that point there was constant disconnects/crashes/retail shortages over the next 6 months and then queues as more players joined and new servers rolled out.   
---
    
---
So the idea of 2 million players all trying to log in at once day one is nothing Vanilla-like at all. The closest thing is TBC launch, but by then they had many more servers, had a queue system in place (up to 2hr + queues on big servers), had areas designed for more players and had a dynamic respawn system in. 
---
Yeah ok. Your trying to compare the 30 hours it realistically takes to solo to max level in retail to the actual hundreds of hours of solo time you have to put into classic. The "social experience" that people think made classic fun is what they remember the most, it's a nostalgia effect. You can claim all you want how the game forces you to be more social because the content is harder or you need others for quests and professions, but in reality the people who are actually dedicated to the game are as social now (or even more thanks to ease of access) then it ever was. It's the casual experience that's talked about the most tho because the game is for casuals nowadays
---
The best one isn't even included in that video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u15HmEMp2Qc)
---
Mages will definitely be more popular but that doesn't mean they are better at all. Mages are good all around and warlocks bring crucial utility. Tbh both are great and you won't be rejected in favour of a mage because mages are so abundant that finding a warlock is actually pretty great. Go with whatever interests you more, both classes bring some great things to groups.
---
But they both fall the exact same distance...
---
Loot trading doesn't mean you can't put on Master Loot. Nobody reserves items without ML. You aren't going to win a roll on a reserved item because they're reserved and looted through ML so a random doesn't loot it.
---
The sunshine &amp; roses are over. For the majority of Alliance players back in the day (and right now on ps), Redridge Mountains was the first contested zone you came upon. And it was often a nightmare. Horde praying on Lakshire were unforgiving. So I decided to make a semi lighthearted video goofing on the trauma Alliance players like myself often faced while leveling there.
---
Despite the struggles, imo rolling on a PVP server is imperative to getting a lively world that really feels like its actually shared between 2 hostile factions. This isnt supposed to be club penguin. 
---
Yea it was amazing! I was actually pretty hardcore in TBC, managed to down Vashj and Kael when they were mandatory for Hyjal attunement! But next exp moved to a different server, without the pvp which I hated haha.
---
“None of the Above”
---
But surely if I get 12 karma, blizz will cave!
---
Haven't looked at the pattern breakdown in a long time, but as to elemental LW, there are a few niche patterns, like the helm of fire agility helm, that because elemental LW is so rare, finding someone to make it while you're leveling could require a decent tip.
---
No, all the specializations are not all made equally, but the fact that 90% will go tribal, 8% dragon scale and 2% elemental, could end up benefiting those who don't want to compete for the devilsaurs exclusively (the biggest reason to go tribal) and want to be the one person people think of when they want those few niche items.
---
In Westfall one of the NPC's sells a special chicken feed macro /chicken and target a chicken until it reacts to you. Then /cheer. It will pop a quest buy the chicken seed or use one you already bought on chicken, congratulations you have a new prarie chicken pet.
---
Don't remember the guild I was in unfortunetly, played a retri paladin called Wrigley and did kael, Vashj and quit raiding after Illidan was down. Was such a great server with a lot of friendly people.
---
Can't play on a none PvP server though, that'd be too boring :D
---
That might be true unfortunetly &gt;.&lt;
---
That's funny coming from someone who uses Grok incorrectly.
---
At the end of BC at that. Had to look it up, but it was announced in August of 08. So 3 months before WotLK.
---
Any healer should be fine. I'd assume any healer would have been working on a full int/healing set of gear since lvl 40 at least. Priest might even be the least effective undergeared healer because they have no way to get mana back unlike the other 3 healers.
---
I'm letting people know to avoid this complete trash, im saving them from this shit.
---
Could just combine the 2 currently most popular "Defiant Oath" 
---
Probably not a popular opinion, but the only "change" I could see as not really game breaking would be to allow people to specialize in more than 1 leatherworking. Say for your 1st specialization, it costs all the items like normal. Than 2nd profession, it would cost double, so instead of 1 of x, y, and z items, it takes 2 of x, 2 of y, and 2 of z, and you can learn both patterns, showing to the trainers your "dedication" to the craft.
---
I support this.
---
i dont think we will see this, since it was not a thing in vanilla
---
you're a smart man, thanks for the suggestion
---
&gt; But for most guilds they just fill spots with warm bodies and the compisition is not so much of a deciding factor for 90% of guilds out there. They just want good dedicated players.
---
This is so true. Play what you want to play, and if you're good and show up consistently you will find a spot in a good guild. The top-of-the-top guilds might be a bit choosier, but even they will take all classes.
---
RemindMe! 1 month

Classy stolen post without any credit /u/yams_1
---
If your dps know to wait before attacking, then it's permissible to precast shield. Sure it decelerates rage (&amp; thus threat) generation, but while the shield is up, the warrior can be positioning mobs and get a little threat with what rage they have. Since you won't need to heal until the shield is gone you won't pull aggro. 
---
That being said, it's more streamlined/speedy to just let the warrior get damage to get rage faster
---
That doesn't matter if your dps don't know how to gear or spec properly. As can be seen by the fact that one of your mages is frost spec...
---
I thought so too - given the old BC "zone into Black Temple and query server if those legendary Glaives are somewhere" trick
---
Substantial if certain
---
Probably casting tranquility. The tranquility effect animation only lasted a couple of seconds in Vanilla
---

---
Blizzard likes to re-invent the wheel every expansion or two. The current suspicion is that Blizzard prefer astral power since it has a more noob-friendly skill floor. Oh and be careful about posting in r/classicwow - "retail player" is used as an insult on this sub, so they're pretty harsh about downvoting
---
I have friends who’ve played 4+ years on the same MacBooks. He’ll be fine. Ultralights dissipate heats just like other laptops, albeit with higher throttling. 
---
What this guy said, windfury totem wont be doing much for ya if you're dead. pally survivability is insane compared to a shamans
---
You will also enjoy being virtually unkillable in PvP. I ran with 30/21 for quite a while and had no issues healing, DPSing, or Tanking all 5 and 10 (UBRS) man content.
---
Not the best raid spec though.
---
Couple of interesting takeaways regarding Vanilla pet behavior: 
---
As I mentioned in the past here, pet behavior was far 'lazier' in vanilla, the pet of the filming character is super slow to respond to her movement even when on follow. In the demo pets were glued 100% to the hunters' left side while one follow (and even seemed to update their position faster than the character at times).
---
The pet of the tauren Hunter when the party runs past RFK is out even though he is mounted. I remembered this being the case at at least some point in vanilla but wasn't sure until now.
---
I just find it interesting to note the things that almost certainly won't be part of classic but vanilla players may remember.
---
You might like Jame’s alliance leveling guide. It starts at 30.
---
http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/old_versions
---
There is difference between posting a standard "can't help" response to tickets versus having to verify who was in what group, verify the item wasn't used, get consent from item holders, then manually moving the item.
---
They won't get any damage refusing to fix player mistakes.
---
It's a loud minority that is fighting for "nochanges", true. But leaving it in, affects everyone, whether they are aware of it or not.
---
I remember that little tid bit dropped my jaw to the floor when Chimly mentioned it. 
---
I hope he does a ScoreCraft for Naxx soon, that’s got some wild music.
---
If you're leveling, you will rarely (if ever) have to farm soul shards. If anything you'll have to delete countless shards.  
---
If you're just doing dungeons, you will occasionally have to grind a couple mobs to boost shards, and definitely if you raid... but here's the thing - you're already going to be grinding mobs for gold. It isn't really a hassle to cast drain soul(rank 1) at the end of each mob.
---
I wouldnt unless its a pull where you think he will die very fast. Its for rage, I know I dont like getting PWS when I pull.
---
My guild still has largely the same people as five years ago, but no one talks anymore outside of raids. It's weird. 
---
Bring on the Zephra mounts!  Lol
---
No mobs either, though.
---
WoW has always been a casual MMO. It's definitely gotten more casual, but even in 2004 it was considered casual relative to its peers. I like how you just slip in "actually dedicated" when what you really mean is heroic/mythic raiding. There are plenty of dedicated players who don't raid. Additionally, if you are doing that kind of content, you're probably in a guild. Which means you already have a social structure from which to build social experiences within the game. Guilds are literally the only source of this left in the game, and Blizz has done much is the recent past to negatively impact guilds as well. So you're point about the most dedicated is essentially irrelevant. Nobody cares about the high-end raiders when talking about this stuff because its not an issue for them. They wouldn't be considered high-end/dedicated if they weren't already willing to go out of there way to do things like communicating (as well as farming, leveling alts, prof/rep/AP grinding etc). For everyone else though (90%+ of players), it is an issue. Go ahead and call all of those people casual if you want, but without they're sub money you wouldn't get raids. Wow cant live on mythic raider subs alone. 
---
You contiously fail to recognize the phenomenon that humans will always take the path of least resistance. For mythic raiders, communication is inherent to that path - its way fucking easier to kill KJ with an active discord than if everyone is silent. For literally everything else, Blizzard has made communication an unnecessary feature. Do I even need to group, let alone communicate with other players to do WQs or war invasions, to do short term war mode PvP? Not really. Do I need to communicate to do Island expeditions, warfronts, heroic or mythic+ &lt;10 dungeons? No. I can automatically form a group, teleport to the dungeon, and start killing trash without a single word exchanged and in less than 10 keystrokes. (Open I, click find group on random, click yes on group prompt, hit w on keyboard, hit first ability - just did all of that in literally 5 actions). 
---
None of this is possible in vanilla. And guess what, however high and mighty you can act now as a big, geared 120 mythic raider, come summer (assuming you play classic), you're gonna be a lowly lvl 10 at some point just like all those filthy casuals. You're gonna be in the same spot as everyone else, trying to find a group for Hogger of Deadmines and using general and trade chat to do it. Why? Because in vanilla, that's the path of least resistance. Yes, spamming "lf1m DM" for 20 minutes IS the path of least resistance. Because your only other choices are to try and 4 man it or ignore it altogether. 
---
EVERYONE is going to be at this spot, btw.
---
I love me some, Aubrey Plaza.
---
The raid was on farm when video was made so a mage not being optimal dps spec isn't shocking. 
---
Also any examples of gear not being right? You dumb fuck, you really think you private server know it alls figured it all out and all us back then were 50 iq noobs that just put on random +int gear on warriors lol . . fuck off. 
---
 New  servers had increased spawn rates, to the point that mobs in starter  zones spawned literally the second you killed them (way faster than what  I saw on X and Y pservers with dynamic spawns). As a melee class, you  would have to back off of the spawn point if you wanted to eat/drink or  take a break. Same went for quest items to pick up and gathering nodes.
---
It  was a mad rush of people straight out of the gate, hundreds of people  all around you killing mobs, but there was enough to kill because people  moved on so quickly since you literally didnt have to move to grind the  quest mob you were on.
---
I do hope they  keep that aspect of the game vanilla, it was a very unique and special  part of WoW that disappeared when they stopped releasing new servers.
---
Tips on getting an orc a raptor mount?
---
You didn't link to the original https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzFrLXAYASc
---
I remember wall jumping to get on top of ironforge, or way up in the mountains and finding ‘unreachable’ mob spawns. I hope it is still in game when they release
---
Are there any TBC or wrath era players who don't find themselves singing those bloody songs all the time? I haven't been able to get them out of my head for 10 years!
---
&gt; Not true, there's tons of 5-mans which drop pre-raid bis and even if you were right my point still stands for one of the most important dungeons.
---
But it needs to drop pre-raid BiS where three or more of the five players can roll Need without getting outed as a ninja looter. How often is that going to happen? It *can* happen but it's going to be unusual and specific.
---
&gt; Ok sure but a lot of dungeon groups take two casters which need some of the same gear as healers. 
---
There's a little overlap, but mostly casters want spellpower and healers want +healing. If it's a huge issue, only bring one caster and one healer.
---
&gt; Also what if the tank wants a leather piece for his DPS off set?
---
Only bring one other leather-seeking DPS toon then.
---
&gt; Have they ever said this? 
---
Not specifically, but it's how it last worked in retail.
---
&gt; Why would it work differently from how it operates on retail
---
That is a damn good question, which you need to ask yourself.
---
&gt; and what problem would it even solve if it was implemented this way?
---
The scenario which the pantswetters are wetting their pants over is this: Nice Thing drops, which you can use and want to roll Need on. Four other people, three of whom can't even use the Nice Thing, all roll Need and one of them beats you. Then they trade the gear to their friend and you QQ.
---
What does it solve if you can't trade gear you rolled Need on? Well, it means the pantswetter scenario can't happen. If plate drops and the priest rolls Need on it for their friend and wins, the plate is now glued to the priest. They can't trade it to their friend.
---
What is a better idea for leveling my warrior when classic hits, mining + skinning for extra money before mount, or mining + engineering for extra gadgets for leveling/endgame?
---
Ah, thought it was the original, since it was the first search result
---
You actually do not need a speed boost, I figured out how to do it without recently. Take a mob from the other side of the bridge, kite it to where you need to jump. Let it kill you, ghostwalk with 125% speed and jump over, res on the other side. Also significantly less risky the doing it alive, because you can walk back over the water after ;)
---
I know. Still worth saying.
---
None of the old addons will work. Classic runs on the Legion client and has a different API. A new wave of fan dedication will need to produce and reproduce mods for Classic.

2. Both using void is the best strategy. Don't factor in Pserver numbers for void threat, its actually quite hard to have 1 VW holding agro on 2+ mobs.
---
Also if you both throw dots on the 2 mobs that each void is tanking they will die so quickly and efficiently that you probably wont have to life tap/drain and they will hold agro easily.

Dude makes some quality content, better than that 10-30 min shit Bellular and Evital/Taliesan clickbait the fuck out of
---
This is why I've set up on an RP server on the few occasions I've played in the last few years. The world feels a lot more immersive and you get to see fun stuff like a group of worgen in lumberjack shirts turning up for brewfest.
---
Hope you enjoyed! Let me know if there's any criticism's or errors so I can correct them. BRD coming soon! 
---
Who else read that in their voices? I know I'm not the only one. 
---
Did you even watch the video?
---
The whole point is for this to be vanilla, calling it something else does not make it different. There was a world first race, but someone already won it 14 years ago.
---
60s killing alliance players in their 20s is not pvp. It's griefing.

It's still something different even though it's suppose to be the same game. The world first race will still be a thing even though some are against it for no reason.
---
I've never really played on RP server so I'm not an expert on the subject, but they're  nice places to hang out. You see people put on events big and small rather than just rushing around, it creates a nice atmosphere. I'm planning on rolling on one for Classic.
---

---
A bad excuse? So you know how much time it would take and are sure they could implement it without breaking other things? Of course a change like this would require testing, and then some kind of beta testing to see what crops up since loot is a core game component and screwing with it comes with risks. But they don't seem to plan on much of a beta if any, and they already have a working system built into the game that would actually require dev time to remove. Seems simpler to just use that one. Oh, wait, that's exactly what they are doing.
---
The polls would only ever be for balance changes as well, should so and so get nerfed: here are our ideas and then they propose the nerf with what exactly they think needs to be done. 
---
Nobody is against it for no reason, it just isn't a thing. Doing a thing that has already been done then yelling "WORLD FIRST!" doesn't make it a thing.
---
So you decide whats a thing for all of us? Private server first races are watched by thousands of people, this race will be watched by hundreds of thousands and we will all be screaming "World first". Why? Because it will be the world first kill on classic servers. You're just a gatekeeper.
---
So long as you stop spending gold on any abilities/spell ranks that aren't absolutely vital to your game play after level 30 then you'll be pretty close to the required amount gold for your first mount by the time you get to 40. 
---
On the 3 characters that I leveled the earliest I got it on was 41 and the latest was 43 and I didn't use the auction house a single time to sell anything, every bit of loot was sold to a vendor instead.
---
Write me a fucking novel why dont you. You literally twisted my words around. I refer to casuals as people who do the minimum of the content available, (i.e lfr, lfg, bg, wq, pet battles) it's the easiest things to do without sinking time into the game. Yes there's a lot of people who do this, they are the casual players for WoW. I never compared it to other games players. Yes these things cause more casual players as it is the path of least resistance, but that doesnt mean socializing is dead, I dont even min-max anymore just because I'm bored of it atm, I hope on for a few rbg's or a heroic raid every now and then, and I always lean towards groups that require mics because I want the interaction, this is what I'm saying, that it's still there. People think they want to be forced to socialize but in reality most of the time it's just a headache having to deal with people that dont know what they are doing and aren't actively trying to improve and hoping for a carry. You will 100% run into these people a lot in classic because of the casual mentality of the playerbase these days. People only think it will be better because of their childhood experiences when they were the fresh player exploring a new game
---
There will be no major pre-gathering because many of the resources needed are also needed for higher end recipes, and the items that arent needed dont give much of a return in terms of the reward for the turn in as the higher end mats do.
---
Yeah. Thats basically what the video is about.
---
Why?
---
how little dps does the hunter need to do before a group of friends decide that he/she is not "worthy" of the polearm their druid friend also needs?  
---
It happened all the time on live before bfa. True there are reputations to uphold, but the downsides to having this feature in clearly outweighs the bad.  
---
Expecting the game to help you undo your mistakes is not a given, especially not when it comes with a cost that risks damaging the social dynamics that made the original game so successful.
---
Used like spending time in here, had warrior quest to do around lv 50. 
---
Thankfully stormwind isn’t too far away so it was pretty easy to get a high level to come help with griefers. 
---
I'll take real experience over vacuum math. In real game situations you can't just sit there and kill mobs every 9 seconds, while skinning always increases your value of beast kills, regardless of time between kills.
---
You can also often auction the higher skins for more money, you regen while skinning (its not literally wasted time), and skinnings cast time is 2, 2.5 (journeyman) and 3 (expert/artisan)
---
Can't remember if this was in Classic or not, but I know in current if you hang out in the throne room of Lordaeron with the ambience maxed out, you can hear the cutscene from WC3 where Arthas kills his father. 
---
Pretty much this just vendor all leathers and you’ll get a level 40 mount 
---
There are events, but not made by Blizzard.
---
My Horde Guild always made up events for ourselfs. Like Murder Mysteries and stuff like that.
---
Also our Warlocks needed to "disguise" themselves in Orgrimmar and we had no Undead in our Clan.
---
On the Alliance side, there was like a Guild that played the Nighwatch in Stormwind. Stuff like that happens on RP Servers. But usually the majority joins to have a chill experience.
---
You have to have RP names and you are not allowed to have "normal" conversations in certain channels like yell or say.
---
warlock sm ruin build op op
---
Yeah! This place is one of my favorites lore/puzzle wise
---
So many naive idiots around here. Its unbelievable. Of course loot trading will mean people are going to behave in more toxic manners. Most people are only as nice as they can get away with being. When there is no consequence to collaborating to steal items through loot trading, people will do it.
---
And because people will do it, everyone else will also do it because they dont want to be screwed over themselves.
---
Cool story bro, except it's not a real thing. Have fun with your pirate server buddies thinking you did something first. 
---
Problem with loot trading is its impossible to prove if the people stealing the item are even remotely capable of using their brains.
---
I thought it more like
---
"Dad please stop griefing/camping me!"
---
There is a ghost in blackrock mountain before brd giving a quest. Only visible when dead I think.
---
You're a sad little being mate.
---
Check out Joanas Vanilla wow levelling guide. He has Horde to 60 and when Beta for Classic is out, he will have the Alliance side as well.
---
Lots of great tips if you want to save time. 
---
But as others have said, just explore and enjoy yourself. Finding things out on your own can feel very rewarding!
---
It’s because to a lot of people including myself, there’s a lot of fun in trying to squeeze the most optimization out of everything you do. 
---
Love your guides mate, great to see more of them. I can't imagine how long the BRD video will be!
---
not if you measure from their heads.
---
Ive been thinking about splitting it up, I'm already past 15 minutes on it with quests alone 
---
screenshot and publicize so people know avoid grouping with that person.
---
Yeah it’s alright, but i tanked 5-man and trash/adds in MC on my feral druid as well and i didn’t have epics. He’s a ST at best, in raids.
---
Hope later on Blizz will balance some of the gimp specs in vanilla, after everyone’s been playing for 1 year and the “no-changes” crowd (which i am part of) moves to “omg balance this shit”.
---
The ones downvoting are blizzard-loot-trading-shill-apologists.
---
Laugh all you want. They exist.
---
&gt;That was a pretty dumb move. Why join a group where a minimum of four other people might want the one thing you want?
---
You have never played Vanilla have you?
---
Literally every UBRS group ever have 2 healers in need of Reed, a mage or a warlock in need of Reed, and 6-7 Melee DPS. Because no other class need anything from the dungeon.
---
Yeah, with the prevalence of screen recording software, more folks being familiar with the idea of screenshots and how to post them, and a higher likelihood of server forum utilization, the naming-and-shaming this time around is going to be real.
---
&gt; That was only applied to BoE items in Wrath or Cata, definitely wasn’t in Vanilla.
---
There was no LT in Vanilla so I think we need to assume that LT in Classic will work like it does in retail.
---
Wasting mana
---
What chair are you using? I’m in a shitty plastic/metal $10 folding one from my card table. I’d love to be convinced to switch it up. 
---
Chill your bones nothing was announced yet.
---
I will be leveling a druid, which means I won't need a mount until 60
---
That will still slow you down! 
---
Dx racer formula series, it also helps me not hunch over like Igor. It’s a little pricey but damn that chair is comfortable.
---
&gt;There's a little overlap, but mostly casters want spellpower and healers want +healing. If it's a huge issue, only bring one caster and one healer.
---
You are assuming the game actually has good itemized items for every slot and role. Which just is not the case.
---
Try actually playing the game before you have an opinion on how the loot system should work.
---
The amount of "resists" in this video makes me sweaty. Better not roll a caster with Blizzlike mechanics on classic, damn. Outside of that, I must say it's the first time I see somebody with all his spells binded and yet still clicking stuff on his main action bar. Some people are really stubborn.
---
Obviously not. Whats your point?
---
why not a simple fix.  they aren't gonna have live gm's this time to help with anything it's all gonna be automated.
---
I just find the phrasing funny.
---
Any beasts around that level range are also fine. Since servers will likely be stuffed with people just grind whatever 35-40 beasts that you can find that are uncontested while on your normal leveling path.
---
Mages are more in demand for dungeons because of how much utility they bring. Warlocks are more in demand for raids because of the unique utility they bring through curses and because they're much rarer than mages.
---
Are you being intentionally dense or what?
---
&gt; You are assuming the game actually has good itemized items for every slot and role. Which just is not the case. You are also assuming every dungeon has drops for every class and role (caster/melee dps/healer/tank) which also just is not the case.
---
Stop bluffing. I actually looked at BiS lists. There's overlap but it's not huge and like I said, if your butt is really puckered over it just go on runs with one caster and one healer. Rogues and hunters are a dime a dozen.
---
&gt; Some dungeons have lots of healer loot and no tank look, other dungeons have no healer loot etc.
---
Is there a point buried in here somewhere?
---
I’m on your side but you seriously gotta stop using that phrase
---
You’ve written it like 4 times in this thread. Pls stop
---
Not to mention that if someone ninjaloot through masterlooter it will be all over reddit 5min later and people will see it.
---
With loot trading you wont even ever know you got cheated out of the item. 
---
Exactly
---
Games been out 15 years. Just say “no trading ever” and let’s be done with it
---
Played a Marks Hunter and Shadow Priest during classic. Thinking of rolling a Warlock this time around.
---
Probably going to go DS/Ruin at 60. But what the best leveling build for a Warlock? Trying to get to 60 as quickly as I can.
---
Are you serious? I've never heard this mentioned.
---
Sounds harder and fun and better loot distribution
---
Cross server BGs should be implemented in a situation where there is 60 / 40 ish faction imbalance.  Nobody wants 45 min queues.  This is not something I would want at launch though.
---
&gt;Raid has Group loot on for trash. 
---
&gt;Raid Leader forgets to swap before fight (happens more than you think)
---
&gt;Raid Leader swaps to Master Loot. 
---
Pretty sure this is much more likely to happen than people ninja’ing with this method. Also people catch on, and he might screw up his reputation a lot on a server if he does this enough or people actually make it known to other players of that realm. 
---
Also, people used the loot changing method not just in classic but I remember it happening in cata too. 
---
Hand of Justice, best in slot for tank and all physical DPS.
---
Briarwood Reed, best in slot for all casters and healers.
---
LBRS Pants ( depending on patch) best in slot for all healers and casters.
---
I could go on.
---
Fact of the matter is you demonstrate a huge lack of knowledge about Vanilla itemization, and now you think you have a right to have an opinion on the matter of loot while being completely ignorant about how the game actually functions.
---
&gt; Is there a point buried in here somewhere? 
---
You seriously cant figure that out? 
---
&gt; You have never played Vanilla have you?
---
Unlike most pirate server players, yes I did play vanilla. So you picked the wrong person to try to bluff with this act.
---
&gt; Literally every UBRS group ever have 2 healers in need of Reed, a mage or a warlock in need of Reed, and 6-7 Melee DPS. Because no other class need anything from the dungeon.
---
I specifically said UBRS is the place where you can concoct a scenario where this actually matters. You have concocted a scenario in UBRS where it actually matters. Congratulations on backing up my position.
---
&gt; Same issue in Strat Undead for the Cape of the Black Baron.
---
So don't go on Strat runs with more than one other non-caster DPS if you really, really want it.
---
&gt; Same issue in LBRS for caster pants/gloves.
---
Same deal. LBRS is 5-toon, just don't bring three people who all want the same thing if this issue is really making you sweat.
---
Most likely you will not be able to trade Need rolled items anyway so it does not matter. But if it did matter, just don't go on 5-toon runs where you know three people all want the same thing.
---
And why would you? You don't jump *from* your head nor do you fall onto your head. And even *if* it was calculated from the head (which it isn't because that would be pretty fucking dumb), it wouldn't change the fact that they still fall the exact same distance. 
---
It doesn't matter if models are 3 feet tall or 7 feet tall because the jump height and fall distance will still be the exact same. The only times hitboxes matter is when doing specific jumps in WSG/on props since you don't want to get stuck on invisible obstacles and smaller models are optimal there.
---
Plus the regen you’re getting while skinning.
---
No one gonna talk about how the Vic Mignognia one was left out?
---
Love it. Even after all these years I wonder how the raid put up with that. Haha.
---
That's because loot trading was never in vanilla. So you don't know how it will be implemented in Classic.
---
&gt; Loot trading works like this: you roll whatever (need, greed, anything) and get an item, BoP or BoE. You have a 2h window where you can trade that item with the other players that could also roll on it.
---
You don't know this. It is more likely that you will not be able to trade anything you rolled Need on, because that would be abusable.
---
&gt; This means you can have someone need the item then pass it to their friends, which screws over other people that also needed the item.
---
We don't know 100% that this is false, but it's certainly the way to bet.
---
You don't account for the time lost traveling to and from the vein.  
---
Did you mine your last test runs ?  
---
In addition to these there is a cool in-browser dynamic guide at http://www.vanilla-questing.me/ - its a nice minimalist guideline.  
---
So work with me here.
---
Suppose Blizzard made it so cloth wearers can't roll Need on leather, mail or plate. Would that partially solve the problem, and eliminate all the imaginary scenarios people are crying over where the priest rolls Need on DPS leather and gives it to their rogue friend?
---
I love wrath babies. The game died after TBC.
---
I disagree, the same argument is used for pro-LFD on retail.
---
&gt;Same issue in Strat Undead for the Cape of the Black Baron.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;So don't go on Strat runs with more than one other non-caster DPS if you really, really want it.
---
So we are back to square one. Which is you having no clue about how the game functions. Here we have a dungeon that has absolutely no caster loot that is best in slot before raiding except some minor pieces like shadow damage boots/neck, and absolutely no tank loot either. 
---
What does this mean? It the amount of melee DPS that want to run that dungeon FAR outnumber the amount of casters that want to run it. Your so called solution of just getting more casters is not feasible when every melee and hunter on the server need to run the dungeon for their prebis cloak while most casters dont even need a single piece of loot there.
---
Because there is no tank loot, your tank is almost always going to be a fury warrior that need the cloak, and unless you are willing to sit for two hours in trade looking for casters, you will have to take multiple physical DPS. There's just no way around it.
---
Thats just how the game is structured, it's poor design but it is what it is. 
---
Buff the pet with consumes. Juju Might, Juju Power, scrolls, get pallies/druids to buff em up with Might/Kings/MotW/etc...
---
* The upgraded dungeon set increases pet damage but it's ridiculously bad in every other aspect and would cost hundreds of gold and many hours to obtain.
---
* T1/T2 set bonuses increase pet HP/resistances (more for T2)
---
* T3 4-set bonus increases pet AP by 50%
---
The issue with BM is that the pet scales in no way with the player's gear. This means a fresh 60's pet will do the same damage as a full T3's pet (minus the T3 4-pc bonus that gives 50 AP to the pet). This makes BM extremely strong early on when most people don't have dungeon gear let alone raid gear, but makes BM fall off hard afterwards. BM is dependant on the pet (duh) and the pet can dish out tons of damage but is also extremely squishy. If it dies, you are a lot weaker than a non-BM hunter.
---
I would.
---
maybe they can have mechanic that would allow for switching in raids but not in single groups while in combat.
---
&gt; Hand of Justice, best in slot for tank and all physical DPS.
---
So the tank should not take more than one other physical DPS on their BRD run. Solved.
---
&gt; Briarwood Reed, best in slot for all casters and healers.
---
UBRS. Congratulations on backing me up again. I said UBRS is the one place where this could realistically matter assuming people take minimal steps to mitigate the issue.
---
&gt; LBRS Pants ( depending on patch) best in slot for all healers and casters.
---
Same again. Take one healer and one other caster, problem solved.
---
&gt; Fact of the matter is you demonstrate a huge lack of knowledge about Vanilla itemization, and now you think you have a right to have an opinion on the matter of loot while being completely ignorant about how the game actually functions.
---
It's cute. It's like a baby bantam rooster on a molehill trying to crow.
---
If your dot has a lot of time left when you kill the mob it usually means that it's a waste of a cast since you want your DoTs to do most of their full damage. 
---
There's no point in casting a dot only to have it do 2 of its 10 ticks before the mob dies, now is there?
---
&gt;So the tank should not take more than one other physical DPS on their BRD run. Solved.
---
Stop coming up with these ridiculous scenarios that are completely unrealistic. Casters need to do emperor runs ONE time for their quest ring, after which they will never run BRD again. Meanwhile every single tank and DPS on the entire server MUST have the trinket because of how incredibly strong it is.
---
It's completely delusional to think your solution is in any way applicable to a real world scenario. I am actually embarassed on your behalf for even writing this.
---
&gt;anyone else ever seen these sinister eyes adding to the eeriness of Duskwood?
---
Literally everyone who passes through 
---
Weird, last time I said private server data wasn't accurate I was berated with negative comments. I don't understand how people think Pserver data is accurate, even Nano himself said it's completely guessed.
---
Good call. Hope Activision Blizzard is reading this. But since they didn't announce anything about pvp they might look out for hints like this. 
---
I was in a heavily imbalanced server in retail vanilla.  The Old Av you want almost never happened because there wasn’t enough horde queuing. 
---
Hi, /u/puffya12
---
&gt; That's because loot trading was never in vanilla. So you don't know how it will be implemented in Classic.
---
Read the title of the OP.
---
&gt; You don't know this. It is more likely that you will not be able to trade anything you rolled Need on, because that would be abusable.
---
&gt; We don't know 100% that this is false, but it's certainly the way to bet.
---
You know the one negative thing about loot trading the entire community has been getting pissy about? Yeah it's most definitely false, not going to happen /s
---
&gt; So we are back to square one. Which is you having no clue about how the game functions. Here we have a dungeon that has absolutely no caster loot that is best in slot before raiding except some minor pieces like shadow damage boots/neck, and absolutely no tank loot either.
---
Did you even play vanilla? Strat undead runs were very popular because not everyone only runs dungeons with BiS. Lots of people are happy with any level sixty blue that is an upgrade.
---
I think you've spent way too long on massively overcrowded pirate servers where everyone effectively has LFG functionality, and where everyone is obsessed with ticking items off a BiS list they found on the internet. In real vanilla you take the runs you can get and the upgrades you can get.
---
&gt; the reality is people arent going to join dungeon groups that has zero items they can use
---
The reality is that in vanilla "items they can use" and "items on this BiS list they found" are not the same thing.
---
&gt; So by your own admission you havent actually played the game in over a decade,
---
Oh boy, this is hilarious.
---
"DID YOU PLAY VANILLA? IF YOU SAY NO UR A NOOB!".
---
"Yes, I did. Did you?"
---
"LOL U PLAYED VANILLA THAT MEANS UR A NOOB!".
---
If you have to try this hard to assert your superiority I think it means you don't have an intelligent argument but you do have a desperate need to impress people on the internet.

&gt; There was no LT in Vanilla so I think we need to assume that LT in Classic will work like it does in retail.
---
There's no reason to assume it won't work like it does in retail to some extent *if* it is implemented.
---
They also appear in Deathknell in Tirisfal Glades.
---
I'd imagine meta would be going Enh with the best 1H or 2H you can find, and being flexible with your weapon enhancement (ie using flame tongue against high armor, WF vs low armor/PvP settings, RB if it's a new rank), and being super conservative on mana usage
---
In WOTLK I was playing pretty casually 2 nights a week raiding at the start because well.. it's naxx25/ony/maly all easy and were on farm.  I was basically forced into raid leading when I didn't want the responsibility of it and was too lazy to tell em' hell no.
---
Well we had everything on clear after a week place was a cake walk a bit later on the raid wiped on 4-horsemen multiple times due to stupid shit and there was constant banter in vent of people talking and no one was concentrating.  I got a bit pissy and told people to get serious wiping was not fun.  Later in the week they QQ'd to the GM who didn't even raid about my attitude.  Left shortly after as shit just wasn't fun I like raiding with people that can chit-chat but still do their job they signed up for.
---
I love my some good "Wake the fuck up times" but people are just way too damn sensitive.
---
ST is one of my favorite vanilla dune
---
&gt; Not specifically, but it's how it last worked in retail.
---
When's the last time you played retail?
---
Yeah, and when you walk by the bell that's crashed into the ground you can hear it tolling. BTW, all of that ambience was in vanilla.
---
Awesome video, very useful. Looking forward to the next ones!
---
Glad you enjoyed! :D
---
There was so much people farming it in pserver, probably will be same here and unviable
---
4) no that’s just dumb. Yeah i remember that crap. The first minute during a match was just a spam of “inv pls” on /s.
---
I agree with the rest but 4 is just a pain in the ass.
---
&gt; Read the title of the OP.
---
Read it yourself. They are asking how loot trading worked. The most recent Blizzard implementation of loot trading did not allow trading Need rolled items. That is completely literally how loot trading worked.
---
&gt; You know the one negative thing about loot trading the entire community has been getting pissy about? Yeah it's most definitely false, not going to happen /s
---
This is the community who collectively believe that TBC resilience killed PvP, it was impossible to find anyone to gank after flying mounts and OG Ragnaros could be killed by clickers in greens.
---
Most people here have *very* limited experience with anything other than pirate servers and are just repeating rumours they heard from equally ignorant people.
---
There was also a memorial set up for one of the devs in the mountains of dun morogh
---
Elemental Earth isn't worth jack shit early on. It's only worth something because the private server you're playing on is near/at the AQ patch and every raider is stocking up on Greater Nature Protection Potions, which require Elemental Earth to make.
---
They won't if no one can see what happen behind the scenes thank to loot trading.
---
I did it without skinning. It's really not worth skilling for the pennies you make. At least not pre 40. 
---
Not really used as quest mobs when you can just kill basilisks in the northern part that are almost 10 levels lower for the quest items.
---
&gt; Stop coming up with these ridiculous scenarios that are completely unrealistic. Casters need to do emperor runs ONE time for their quest ring, after which they will never run BRD again. Meanwhile every single tank and DPS on the entire server MUST have the trinket because of how incredibly strong it is.
---
Sucks to be them then. If you've found one or two items in poorly itemised dungeons where this means it's going to be slightly harder for some people to find groups that means this is not a major issue.
---
And there is nothing in this game you MUST have, unless you are an over-dramatic baby. If it's too hard to get then people will put something else in the slot and get on with the game, like we did in real vanilla.
---
&gt; It's completely delusional to think your solution is in any way applicable to a real world scenario. I am actually embarassed on your behalf for seeing you even write this and we are back to square one again. Your understanding of how the game works is so lacking that there's no point taking anything you write seriously. You clearly have no clue.
---
It's like a tiny little monkey beating its chest. So sweet!
---
We're talking about the last implementation of loot trading before personal loot came in.
---
Dungeon finder wasn’t released in the first weeks of wotlk. How did you level up?
---
&lt;3
---
Maybe you missed the fact that I replied to someone who lied about loot trading not existing in vanilla? The discussion was not how it was implemented but rather that it was implemented at all. There are plenty of good arguments *to change it* from how it was in vanilla, but *lying about it* because someone thinks they are a hardcore "no changes" player is not at all in good faith.
---
Its depends, if this happens once in a blue moon then it probably doesn't hurt them. I've been in guilds with leaders that are 99% chill but then some times they just blow. It doesn't hurt the guilds, most people tend to find it funny.
---
That been said I assume in this case its a near daily occurrence and probably killed the guild.
---
hmm CR Bgs or 5 hour queues... yes very tough decision.
---
&gt; (and even seemed to update their position faster than the character at times)
---
This is kinda-sorta blizzlike, just due to how the client-server architecture works. You can see the same thing on private servers, how Aggressive pets will attack respawning mobs before players can even target the mob, because there's 0ms latency between the pet and the mob, because both of them are part of the server, not the player's client.
---
Dude that's hopeless. They have no idea that there may be things that work well while not being 100% optimal. It's either BiS or die.
---
Majority of us behaved like you do in Vanilla. For me it wasn't even remotely imaginable to wear other armor types for something, specially because it was most often in competition with other people needing this as their sometimes only armor type choice.
---
She hasn’t aged a day either. 
---
just connect the image input cable of choice to the monitor on one end and then put the other end in the waffle iron. Turn the waffle iron on and close to solder shut. You should be getting a connection after that!
---
Completely disagree about cross server BGs - I played before and after and desperately want to see them included in Classic. You may never have made friends PvPing after they were implemented but I made plenty - perhaps it was just your server but I was in multiple PVP guilds and the sudden increase in available BGs from 1.12 onwards seemed to push more people into PVP since you were no longer having to queue an hour to get an AB.
---
Pff? Ages? Sounds like last Tuesday.
---
I heard the opposite about AV, that original AV was a "pve battleground" with super powerful mobs/NPCs and PvPers complained that there was too much PvE in their PvP, so later AV was changed to nerf the NPCs.
---
People running past each other on mounts and racing to the end is just a result of wanting to farm honor / rep as fast as possible, not a fault of the BG design.
---
yea probably you are right
---
I remember when they reduced the amount of experience you needed to level, all of my twinks we're at 99% to level and it pushed them all to level 20/30/40 I was so sad.
---
In vanilla you couldn't change the loot rules in combat.
---
&gt; The most recent Blizzard implementation of loot trading did not allow trading Need rolled items. 
---
Gonna need some source on that because I played for years before that "change" happened and up until BFA dropped, and I don't remember that happening. 
---
&gt; 
---
Nice hyperbole.
---
&gt; Most people here have very limited experience with anything other than pirate servers and are just repeating rumours they heard from equally ignorant people.
---
You mean like how you're taking the moral high ground because you  played the game 14 years ago and have no clue how things are today and act like a dick because you have no clue what you're talking about?
---
By level 10 last night my friend whose been playing vanilla for years had 4 gold from skinning. Every penny adds up.
---
If I'm playing a druid hybrid spec I use gear to swap between roles, not just form changes.  All hybrids can change roles like this without respeccing.
---
In almost every thread about loot someone says something along the lines of "people should only roll need on gear for the role they are performing in the current group but if no one 'needs' it offspecs can roll".
---
&gt;You had no point.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It's perfectly valid to not let the healer roll on DPS gear in Strat UD. The dungeon has two of the best prebis healer items so finding healer is not exactly difficult for that dungeon. 
---
What if the druid is only tanking the dungeon because they can't find a tank, but they are only running it for the healer gear? Your claim they should run it as a healer but there's also an over supply of healers wanting to run it so going in as a tank will mean more runs for everyone. 
---
&gt;Besides, this has nothing at all to do with loot trading. You are just derailing the discussion because you deep down know that loot trading is a bad system.
---
I'm totally against loot trading, but if every loot trading thread has people claiming you can only roll on gear for your current role then obviously they are the threads to talk about it.
---
&gt;Your motive for this? No clue. Maybe you just like to argue, or maybe you intend to abuse the system yourself. Either way, your avoidance of discussing the actual topic by nitpicking on some part of my post that had nothing to do with the argument at hand makes me suspect you have ulterior motives.
---
I do love to argue, but bringing up a side point to address a common misconception is in no way devious.  Where better to correct that misconception than where it is expressed?
---
I'm guessing you play pure dps classes and just can't stand the thought of healer or tank getting "your" gear. 
---
Battle masters in the cities is a quality of life I would enjoy. Having to make your way to the entrance for AV or AB for horde is a pain. Same for alliance to get to WSG. 
---
I think I want to care about this, but its such a small part of the game. When Im chaining instances for my prebis, its with my guild mainly, not rando pugs.
---
After I obtain it I never really run those for gear much anymore because raiding takes that spot. The number of times I expect to even encounter a scenario where loot trading matters is like single digits, lol.
---
Those 2 aren't comparable at all. You *can't* make a one buttom macro usually, unless you break the game with addons. (vanilla is fully bottable)
---
Pretty sure you could.
---
Noggen digger worked with ghost wolf too. My mates shaman used to use world enlarger and noggen fogger to shrink and go skeleton, and would run around looking like a rat zooming all over the place. Having a weapon with an em hat glow made it better too 
---
&gt; Gonna need some source on that because I played for years before that "change" happened and up until BFA dropped, and I don't remember that happening.
---
Someone was saying it was around 4.3.
---
But before we go on, do we agree that **if** it is is impossible to trade Need-rolled items this solves literally all the claimed problems with loot trading? And **if** this was indeed the last implemented version of loot trading before personal loot, that this is the most likely version for Blizzard to implement?
---
&gt; You mean like how you're taking the moral high ground because you played the game 14 years ago and have no clue how things are today and act like a dick because you have no clue what you're talking about?
---
Someone is acting like a dick and is clueless. But who?
---
Must protect cartoon lady’s honor!
---
I'd have both be full affliction, both use voidwalkers.
---
The only points I'd say are required: http://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE
---
Send voids into crowd simultaneously, dot up everything fear things that come at you. If both voids are occupied and so are both fears, the lock being attacked wands/lifedrains and the lock not being attacked shadowbolts.
---
Tons of potential for pulling too many but tons of potential for dealing with it. Should be a good time regardless of how you play it, I just recommend you push your limits.
---
I was in Orcs of the Red Blade when there was the server wide war campaign that started at Stromgarde and progressed to/from UC/IF depending on who won. Good times
---
Is there any word if classic will start with 8 debut slots, then move to 16 later on? If it stays at 8 debuff slots you won’t have Spriests till AQ when if changed 
---
Sorry if this sounds silly, what is spell batching?
---
By this logic bringing a level 15 mage into MC is "viable".
---
You keep contradicting yourself because you are trying to set up a dichotomy between the different parameters of loot trading that have existed as if they are different things. Loot trading existed since vanilla as you admit. Saying it didn't originally exist because loot trading became automated and more casual later is just factually wrong. It's like saying they shouldn't have the vanilla lfg system because you hate how dungeon finder works now.
---
Try to be honest when you demand changes to the game instead of spreading misinformation or ask people who played vanilla so they can explain how the game used to work.
---
40+ bank alts isn't too much of an issue to get on a private server; 40+ on wowc is 6 paid accounts minimum. Have fun paying close to $100/mo just to store shit for a game event.
---
Sure, that's definitely the cause. I just think it's interesting that true vanilla pets lagged behind the closer to the hunter's server side position while demo pets (as seen by any hunter videos of the demo) seem to cling to the client side like they're on a short leash.
---
Good point.
---
Shapeshifting after eating a deviate will remove your deviate buff.
---
Its also easy to misclick abilities and die all the time, do you do that?
---
Or did you learn not to because of negative feedback?
---
I recently offered to help out a rogue doing his poison quest on a server that shall not be named. I noticed he started RP'ing as soon as we set off. Seemed kinda goofy to me so I just let him type in chat and kept my mouth shut when he had us stop near some bushes so he could 'check the defenses'. Although I've never RP'd I decided to sprinkle in a few comments to help his RP immersion. I admit it was kind of fun. Like a story that is writing itself in real time. 
---
Don't think I'll be seeking out any RP in the future, but it was a little fun being creative on the spot. And I'm sure the rogue I was helping out probably had more fun when he wasn't doing it alone.
---
Yeah, those are definitely comparable. I can see how someone could draw direct comparisons between a level 60 Paladin and a level 15 Mage. 
---
Good job, you caught me in a logical corner.
---
If there is no toggle I won't play it for real. Can't stand the super outdated graphics in 2019. 
---
Oh man :( that sucks
---
Just like a regular server except with a big no-go zone in Goldshire Inn.  I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
---
Flashbacks of hours farming gravemoss and elemental earth :(
---
This is a question we can find answers to in about 18months.
---
There's quite literally NO NEED to worry about this just yet. Numerous questions have been asked regarding this topic and there's several possible options available ranging from new servers to character copies to new server to full progression (which still is the unlikeliest model of all).
---
Ultimately: wait it out and see. First and foremost Classic HAS TO become a full financial success for Blizzard. Otherwise they will not bother thinking about "what's next".
---
Yes I read your reply. He doesn't have to work fulltime at Blizzard to get hired to make the an occasional trailer. I.e. freelance work. He and Blizzard won't do it, but they could.
---
You mean months after naxx when most of the playerbase still hasn't even cleared AQ?
---
Id like to see TBC as it's my favorite expansion.
---
I hate cross server battlegrounds. Absolutely hate them. One of the biggest things that ripped the game world apart for me.
---
I also played mostly on the underpopulated faction before they came out and the little bit I played on the overpopulated side showed me the point.
---
I am off the opinion that they might be a necessary evil, in which case the goal should be minimizing the damage. To me that means make the battle groups as small as possible. 2 servers wouldn't make much difference. 4 might be okay. 10 probably means garbage PvP community. If they can do mostly 2-4 server groups it might be a net positive.
---
Science bitch!
---
TBC is definitely more likely than a whole new expansion. 
---
Ask anyone who raided in vanilla. If you never had to make a ticket about loot then you were in the absolute minority.
---
I mean you don't even need high int gear to figure this out; Blizzard wouldn't automate a process if it was rarely used.
---
Also your note on p servers would get you laughed out of any GM channel in existence. Where did you even get that idea?
---
Gargantuan if big.
---
I think the problem would still be that specs like elemental are just not interesting enough to put the effort into specing into it. That i what this discussion is about. How to make those specs more interesting for players.
---
We were young children.
---
The only people who don't want XRBGs are the ones who weren't on an unbalanced or dead server.
---
Coincidentally, there is also high crossover with #NoChanges people. It turns out they do want changes; just THEIR changes.
---
That’s fine, I’m not going try hard in pvp. Im probably gonna be the guild alchemist anyway but it’s good to know I can help my pvp out a bit doing so regardless :)
---
Thanks!
---
This is the exact same argument used for LFD-defenders on retail.
---
How are you NOT GETTING THIS? GM’s fixing loot was not and is not loot trading. THEY COULD AND DID TELL PEOPLE “NO.” I have not contradicted myself once in my stance on this. Im not demanding a change, YOU ARE. The system you are asking for was not in Vanilla, period. There is no false information, only someone that refuses to let people like you make loot-trading seem like an original Vanilla feature. 
---
Trying to say a 4-5 day turn around, limited per player, gear change via GM is the same as the Loot-Trading system introduced in WOTLK is absolutely INSANE.  
---
They do pretty similar dps to be fair
---
He, himself, said he quit blizzard in the very thread in which he announced that blizzard approached him.
---
He is not working with Blizzard at this point in time.
---
&gt;The ones downvoting are blizzard-loot-trading-shill-apologists.
---
You have the right intentions but you come off as toxic. Yes they are wrong objectively. No they are not shills. 
---
Mining + skinning easily, the gadgets aren't as integral to warrior as they are to something like a paladin and leather is always at its most expensuve at the beginning. 
---
1. why are there bloodelfs?
---
2. he had recklessness for the biggest portion of the bossfight, picking such a rare, hefty-dps phase out and saying like "yeah boiz, ima do 1,4kdps in pre bis!!!!11" is completely redicolous
---
one of those classic dungeons where half the difficulty is just finding the zone in portal (see also - maraudon)
---
Why's it need to be 2 hours? If a genuine mistake is made wouldn't it be recognised instantly? Surely 5 minutes would be plenty of time. 
---
Well the pop will be wayyy lower, and because of actual time zones for servers, there will be down time with even less ppl.
---
I played on a 100-200ish population private server and we got all the way to Naxx. Pvp was a struggle, only at certain times and always the same composition (playing 4 warriors into 4 mages is not fun). Definitely keen for a larger population server so the AH is active too. Having to farm 100% of your own consumable mats is a struggle.
---
From memory we also cheated a little, when a player was burnt out and quit we would give their account to someone new to play, so we didn’t lose geared players, just experienced ones
---
Just stay away from the Goldshire Inn....
---
True, i forgot p serv are ridiculously overcrowded
---
But battlegrounds already used the same system as LFD...
---
Would you be for having to get a group of 15 together and manually walk into AB instead of using the queue system?
---
I totally understand why someone wouldn't want cross realm bg, but comparing wanting that to wanting LFD is just disingenuous. If Blizzard caps servers at 2.5k or whatever then prepare for some servers to pretty much never play AV.
---
your favorite ice cream is VANILLA!
---
This was the exact same for me except, I didn't know that there was a boat, which took you to Wetlands. So instead, I ended up running to Ratchet, taking a boat to Booty Bay, and running the whole way to Elwynn Forest.
---
if classic is successful (profitable) we will get TBC servers
---
then it only stands to reason they will offer people transfers to BC servers and periodically open "new" fresh classic servers starting at T1 again and progressing to BC and repeating etc
---
It already isn't, it's classic. 
---
\#nochanges EXCEPT FOR THE ONES I LIKE
---
Okay so if we are talking about loot trading, what gives you the impression that we are talking about the version that came after vanilla rather than the version that was in vanilla when were are discussing WoW Classic which is based on vanilla?
---
Nah 1.12 is the name of the game here.
---
the English 
---
This place was a nightmare to run for me, I had so many failed groups in here, felt like a curse. 
---
You need cross realm BG's or you're gonna make the dead server problem even worse. If people start feeling like they can't get battlegrounds on smaller servers nobody is gonna wanna play there. Sure if you play on some maxed out server it's great, but for everyone else it means that unless you have a couple hours set free every day, you're probably not gonna get an AV to pop, especially not if the realm is unbalanced H:A.
---
Like if you play on a 1.5k pop realm, with a 70:30 H/A ratio, then seriously good luck getting BGs as a horde. People will leave that server so fast.
---
Yup.
---
Give me healing plate and we're good. Otherwise, I'll be in my frilly pink dress.
---
Here's the thread in which he said it didn't lead anywhere:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6nutym/z/dkcmkpa/
---
Considering that statement, it's not going to happen.
---
1. agreed, pretty much quit PvP in 1.12 because I missed the old crowds. This is one of those things where people say they dont want cross-realm dungeons or such, when xrealm BGs are essentially the same thing but for PvP.
---
2. This is a complaint I dont get from people, Battlemasters were hardly late, they were added in 1.7. BGs were added in 1.5. If anything Battlemasters were in the game for more of Vanilla than not. Ive professed this before, but this is one of the few fun low timesinks in the game, log on, do a WSG quick and quit. Battlemasters are a good thing, they get you right into the action.
---
3. Rollback or changes to 1.12 AV should be the number 1 change from 1.12. The PvE race analogy is true. My main argument against anyone that claims they like AV 1.12, is they dont, because the only reason they give is "I can get exalted in a weekend". Thats not liking AV, thats getting instant gratification rewards and then avoiding it entirely. And isnt instant rewards exactly the kind of thing were trying to get away from?
---
4. I really dont understand this complaint, this change is kind of big for people with bad gear or healers who dont get any HKs. I mean, it was kind of nice to go solo in AV and snipe NPC kills for the loot, but I mean... that wasnt really in the spirit of AV and was pretty selfish of me. As for making seperate groups, why? Other than to try to horde more honor if you have better gear. Auto-grouping just makes more sense in terms of coordination.
---
In the end, in terms of changes from 1.12, definitely AV should the top priority followed by no cross-realms.
---
No, I mean half of a good rogue or warrior. On pserver anyway. 
---
Completely different situations. Finding groups for 5 mans (and then later raids) is a core social interaction of the game that builds realm communities. Having groups take longer to make but enforcing this interaction is an easy trade off.  
---
For PvP on the other hand the reality is on a low pop, PvE, or imbalanced realm (ie probably 75% of realms), you can just forget about battle grounds as content for 20 hours of the day. You literally won't be able to queue into one. Yes it sucks that it makes PvP less realm community centric, but you know what is way worse for the pvp community? No one doing PvP, at all. Because that's what happens when there's no CRZ Bgs with Vanilla server caps.
---
I hear you. I disliked grouping for anything with people that are still stuck in their childhood phase... being thin skinned and taking everything personal. It's indeed best to just quickly move on if you find yourself in such groups. Not saying that those people are playing the game wrong. They might have a jolly good time being stuck on the same content for months, but for me that ruins the game.
---
You cought me cheating... trying to avoid cloth as much a possible has its limitations. Any suggestions for mail or plate gloves?
---
This isn't actual vanilla.
---
This is a re-creation in 2019 which will primarily be played by experienced players.
---
Ironforge. A holdover from day 1 when everyone used IF as a hub until the fixed the Auction Houses.
---
Also, hilariously easy to navigate. Even if you go the wrong way you STILL eventually end up where you were headed.   &lt;3
---
You can't stop the implications of loot trading, unless you want to personally keep up with everyone's gear obsessively. Why do you ask? Let me explain.
---
Let's say I and four other friends want to roll rogue so we can be a five man death squad or something in wpvp.
---
Well, what would happen if we joined a raid and pretended not to know each other as well as we truly do, so we just look like guildies and not loyal irl friends out to get just get ours.
---
Let's say nightslayer bracers drop but four of our five already have them. The other four can swap out their nightslayer bracers pre encounter to shadow craft and then roll on the bracers when they drop, and instead of equipping them they equip the nightslayer bracers they already had and then trade the new ones to their fifth friend that needed them.
---
Unless some guild member was hyper aware of what gear everyone was wearing and has earned prior, you wouldn't be able to prevent this from happening. Even then the person who earned the gear illegitimately can just show up to the raids not wearing it if they are suspicious, then claim they got it in a different raid later.   Pugs would be absolutely screwed. 
---
This will happen if loot trading exists. People will do this. I promise you. 
---
If this was true, we would be getting every single raid, upgraded dungeon gear, 0.5 tier gear, new post 1.10 dungeon drops, pvp gear, all BGs and upgraded PvP gear at release.
---
&gt;screenshot and publicize
---
Where?
---
Aesthetically Stormwind. Ironforge for convenience,
---
Undercity because the elevator boss is hilarious.
---
Is there a difference between items that give a flat, white-text bonus to, for instance, healing spells (such as Hunter's Bracers of Healing or whatever) and the items with green text, the "increases healing done by spells and effects by up to X"?
---
I could honestly live with battlemasters and forced grouping, I agree that old AV and no cross-server bgs are a top priority. I also don't understand why LFD/LFR is bad but people immediately are OK with cross-server bgs. The only thing I can think of is private servers have them or something.
---
[https://youtu.be/HEV4GqQF\_3A?t=189](https://youtu.be/HEV4GqQF_3A?t=189)
---
Youre correct in the reasoning for the changes, but the changes in fact had the opposite effect. it wasnt easy to just run passed mobs, you had to fight through them and the only way to get through them quickly was large groups, which would be easily met with an opposing large group because youre not simply mounting passed. People running passed eachother because its faster honor and rep is 100% the fault of the BG design. BGs are meant to have objectives, in order to achieve them, youre supposed to have to PvP for them.
---
And you bring up yet another point about AV, no one used to just go there to get epics, the rep was on par with WSG/AB in terms of time spent. Everyone that wants Classic complains about instant gratification rewards, which is the only reason people play 1.12 AV. AV was different PvP, just a big 30 man vs 30 man pushfest (there was always like 10 people wandering off doing something else), 1.12 changed that into the PvE race that it became.
---
Hi, /u/NovaLizzie
---
Haha Darnassus was pretty, but felt poorly designed.
---
Hey guys, I put together this video goofing on the hardship low level Alliance players typically have while leveling in Redridge. Despite PVP servers being very rough some times, overall i think rolling on one contributes towards a much more gratifying &amp; lively Azeroth. 
---
Objectively, PvP adds more to server community than PvE.

---
Two words:
---
FRE SH
---
Yeah I got you. Let's see if classic has more to offer than this BiS or die bullshit.
---
Viability and all that is fine but it is more than skill points spent and gear. The more suboptimal those two things are the more dedication people can expect from the player. 
---
We'll see. Hope it's not lost entirely. 
---
Darnassus was the first city that I saw when I was 11 and started playing so it will always hold a place in my heart. 
---
I think even 2 servers would be a big no no. You would never see 50% of the people in the world or anywhere else in the game, which kills the magic of server community for me.
---
I don't think it's a necessary evil as much as I don't think LFD is a necessary evil(and most people agree with this). The game isn't going anywhere, who cares if you have to sit there for 45 minutes at a time to get a match? Go fish, talk to people, level a craft, grind some mobs, etc.  This also is better for rank14 grinding as you're playing less, while with cross-server you have instant queues and are playing 100% of the time(not counting the ~2m wait at start of bg) with zero downtime between matches. Really burns you out.
---
Like I said, the game isn't going anywhere, you don't need instant queues and instant gratification because the game needs to last, and vanilla WoW has tons of mechanics in it that are arbitrary waits to extend how long it takes to do something. I think PvP shouldn't be an exception - current WoW is so easy and accessible to get into that people level to cap and get geared up in respectable gear then go "ok what now?", which is something that takes MONTHS to do in Vanilla and extends your play time. Artificially? Sure, but that's the name of the game(MMOPRPG) and what the genre was founded on.
---
The release of WoW and LotR were so well timed together.
---
A good retribution paladin will do less than half the dps of a mediocre rogue or warrior in pre-raid BIS. As you progress through raid tiers that gets worse and worse.
---
I don't think battlemasters are that big of an issue, honestly. I just think no battlemasters is more interesting for encouraging world pvp.
---
It's yo boy.
---
Maybe it's good to make the BiS check and to stay or off guilds/ raid groups who try to go 100% BiS or die.
---
I'm okay with clearing content a few months later than the profession guilds. What I'm not okay with is stubborn people trying to tell me that there's no other way to play the game. 
---
I will have a good time giving this cloth robe to the shadow priest or the feral druid in my dungeon group. 
---
Cheers
---
You could do this in Vanilla, I know eventually this was changed to where the loot rules could no longer be changed in combat. Just can’t find the proof if it was late Vanilla or Early TBC.
---
You have to admit, that's stretching the definition a bit.
---
I can swear there were some in a bar in Stormwind. 
---
I picked Ironforge! I liked it better than Stormwind!
---
Chances are. 
---
If classic is a success they will release a TBC server. Then a WOTLK if that works. And so on. If there shows that this brings subs back to wow then it’s more likely they will release something to let everyone play their favorite expansion. 
---
I’m literally trembling. I didn’t get to experience this stuff and I’ve been shaking because I want it to be summer already. 
---
Yes I am usually 33/34 when I start there 👍
---
Thanks
---
I'm a big fan of the Shia LaBeouf bit. 
---
JUST DO IT. 
---
thats not necessarily how it works. dungeons, raids, pvp etc is usually done out of character. rp is something separate you do in your spare time.
---
The entire point of Classic is to provide players with the perks of Blizzard's retrospect while maintaining the gameplay of the original release.
---
Waiting 45 minutes-2 hrs to pop a BG is not a fun thing. 
---
You may think you know better than the gamerunners but you really just don't in this case. 
---
Just because something wasn't added until late vanilla doesn't mean its a bad thing, servers are never gonna bet like they were during actual vanilla and lots of us are coming back solely for pvp. I think not having them would be a mistake.
---
Another designed gold sink that used to work as intended.
---
Gotta spend it somehow 
---
This is what it’s all about. So cool you have so many pictures of “firsts”
---
This is wrong though. The time you lose traveling slower costs you the ability to grind more gear. There is nothing more important than travel speed while leveling. 
---
Hey guys, I put together this video goofing on the hardships low level Alliance players typically have while leveling in Redridge. Despite PVP servers being very rough sometimes, overall I think rolling on one provides a much more gratifying &amp; lively Azeroth. Hope ya'll find this funny!
---
You people have terrible taste. Stone walkways are not more aesthetic than the wonder of architecture and beauty that is Darnassus.
---
It's literally what they are designed to do. 
---
&gt;everyone used IF as a hub until they fixed the Auction Houses.
---
I forgot about this, will IF still be the primary alliance capital in Classic? Retail got me pretty burned out on SW, hoping to have a reason to stay with the Dwarf master race.
---
Of all the times ive heard the Onyxia wipe, how the fuck have I never heard this one before??
---
Loving your videos so much. Going to come in really handy pretty soon.
---
People have done the math on it based on time and money you get. Not really worth it at most times just killing mobs is actually faster gold and it's more xp too.
---
Glad you like em' getting close to the final stretch here 
---
Ironforge and SW = Coke
---
Darnassus = "Is Pepsi OK?"
---
Look at how amazing the server infrastructure was in 2006! Why did Blizzard severs get worse over the next 13 years?
---
/s
---
I wonder what goes through people's heads when they ask questions like this.  
---
&gt; **I am a server administrator with over 8 certifications and degrees** and  work on systems and clients like these every day. You are just an  armchair fan spouting bullshit about shit you don’t know. 
---
Please do go on about bullshit that isn't related to model discussion, weird flex guy
---
Here's a brilliant fucking idea:
---
If you want a piece of loot, ask who in the group is going to roll for it.
---
&gt; Many will be done secretly 
---
When you join a party, ask who is going to roll on the item.
---
When four people say they are rolling on it, you're free to leave, and form your own group.

Without looking at the code, it's impossible to say, but my guess is it is determined on the first looting. You loot, the server runs a subroutine to hit the mob's loot table and do a figurative 'roll' to determine the final result.
---
Turtles. Turrrrrtlessssss
---
This conversation is amazing.
---
&gt; who cares if you have to sit there for 45 minutes at a time to get a match?
---
Probably everyone but you tbh. I remember 3 hour queues only to have them pop when I decide to go make a snack or take a dump and then I didn't get to do any BG's at all that day. Someone can play an hour a day and never get to do a BG, that's just not good for the majority of players. 
---
Im for certain changes even as far as transmog on clientside only (others cannot see it) and even I am against cross realm anything besides cleaning up dying/crowded realms as was done before (the details of which servers qualified for it i dont remember)
---
This would ruin the obvious world immersion that is so coveted in classic wow.
---
There’s the obvious economic issue where people aren’t spending their money after buying gear/mount.  Then there is the issue of hard talent choices.  
---
When there’s no tax on switching  talents around, there’s no sense character identity.  You won’t be known as the ‘tank guy’ or the ‘elemental shaman’ or ‘melee hunter’ when every time someone sees you you’re specced and geared differently.  This restriction on respec costs made vanilla vanilla.
---
Do you really want hardcore raiders buying all the consumables and jumping into PvP with the best gear and most optimal specs with no repercussions?  It will still happen but they will need to be farming to make enough gold to do it.  
---
Seriously, I feel like this was uncovered in a shipwreck or something.
---
I always see people say pick skinning. Imo before heavy leather its genuinley not worth it.
---
To the ignorant fucks downvoting actual facts...
---
Stances have their own gcd seperate from the usual ability gcd. You are all idiots.
---
Here's another thing you might not know, weapon swapping is on your ability gcd while in combat, outside of combat is has no gcd.
---
I'm 67.896% sure they disappear after like an hour of being logged out.
---
In a lot of ways I agree with you, but I think a) there's a good chance it happens anyway, and b) it really might still be a better choice.
---
Lemme give a little background so my position makes more sense. I originally played on Arthas (later transferred to Mal'ganis). As far as I can tell, Arthas had one of the strongest communities in the game. When FacesofWoW was a thing Arthas had like 3x the pictures. Our forums were crazy busy. And a lot of the videos people remember from that time were from Arthas (Roguecraft, Maydie, Pat). We also had the 5v5 nights that people have talked about a bit but those don't seem to be as famous.
---
I played horde and rerolled alliance after C'thun was killed, but PvP on Arthas as horde was amazing. We had tons of rivalries, tons of trash talk, and loved it. Cross Server BGs absolutely killed that pretty much instantly. The two changes that had the biggest negative impact on the game for me when I played were cross server BGs and resilience. I honestly, truly  hate cross server BGs.
---
But when you switch sides, there is another side to it. 45 minutes isn't the worst, but it's also shorter than any of the queues were for Alliance on Arthas. It also artificially prevents some people from playing BGs at all. I do buy your point about rank 14, but that only is applying to one faction anyway.
---
I do get you about not seeing the people in the world, but honestly, on a big server you would run into groups you don't know and random PUGs where you know 1 or 2 people all the time anyway. At least for me, most of the rivalries came out of the battlegrounds themselves anyway. Sure we could see the other groups outside too, but a much bigger factor was playing against them in battlegrounds frequently.
---
I won't be upset if they don't do any cross server BGs. I definitely was initially against them completely. But at this point I do expect that they're going to be in (since they were in for 1.12) and I do honestly think 2 servers would have enough benefits that I wouldn't be upset with that like I would with a 10 server battlegroup.
---
(also sorry if this is disjointed, typing this while doing some other stuff at the same time)
---
Tzuma is one brave mother fucker.  
---
The actual argument is that it hinders your ability inputs, you can press two different buttons faster than you can press the same one twice.
---
oh boy, such a waste of time!
---
Cross-realm BGs were part of Vanilla.  Realms were grouped in later patches to enable cross-realm BG play.
---
It's almost like the big streamers don't experience the game nearly the same way as us others and therefore want different things because it pleases them. Are blizzard gonna listen to them? Probably.
---
Yes. It’s not even a #nochanges vs #changes debate. The change from Vanilla is that we already know what is required, so that argument is moot. 
---
I’ve seen some solutions brought up in this sub, which are varying in terms of clunkiness and delivery. One idea is to make all pre-existing materials marked with a “Pre-war effort” tag, so you have to start fresh with building up your materials. And then when the war effort is finished, remove the tag entirely since it’s obsolete. Blizzard has to let the people know well in advance though, to prevent any salty salty tears about all their wasted work.
---
Another is to simply change the materials. This is maybe less invasive and awkward, but harder for Blizzard to pull without angering people. The mats would have to be faithful to the original war effort, so maybe instead of bandages it would be a certain food cooks can make, of some anti-venom, keeping in with the RP of a silithus based war effort.
---
The only poor option is to do nothing. The war effort really needs some freshness to keep it *like it was*.
---
1. Removes a gold sink
---
2. Changes the loot dynamic from people having a general spec and only hybrid classes taking spare gear for off-spec, to everyone rolling need on everything because they can respec for free to a more effective off-spec.
---
Aubrey Plaza was in these? Holy shit I missed this...What was the air date? I'm surprised cuz I don't think she was *that* popular until Parks and Rec hit its stride around the 3rd-ish season.
---
Pretty sure it's like 12-ish points in Affliction (improved Drain Soul I think), then all the way down Demonology, then back to Affliction. Tips and that Alive guy did an hour+ Warlock Guide, and I think Kargoz has one as well.
---
...No? To my knowledge, "preraid BIS" has always meant that. Pre-BIS lists have always included crafted items like Lionheart Helm.
---
Cross realm BG's came in patch 1.12 leading up to TBC..
---
Capital city I'd want to live in rl?  Thunderbluff!  No question. 
---
Would I watch it? Absolutely.
---
Would they make it? Unlikely, they made it when WoW was a cultural phenomenon, and sadly it isn't anymore.
---
really? cuz to me it seemed like a marketing team knew about, and took inspiration from those old ass FRAPS videos people made back in vanilla and TBC about switching specs and shit.
---
I normally patrol red ridge on my 22 rogue. It’s fun to have some good massive fights against multiple people, and sometimes hide from 60s and get a lucky sap on them.
---
It’s still obnoxious to me when I see 60s rolling through, 1 shooting everybody. Not only are they taking away the alliances fun, their taking away *my fun* too! And at least I get HKs for it.
---
I'm not familiar with there being any white-text +healing. The only white/green distinction I can recall is with armor - some equipment has green bonus armor that isn't multiplied by Bear Form's multiplier
---
God I wish they were all in my basement 
---
&gt; Why is someone who signed with a esports organization who will push for things that the original WoW designers called a mistake (arena), a guy who never cleared a WoW raid until WOTLK and who didn't know demo shout revealed rogues while "maining a warrior" and Asmon who never did anything in real vanilla and knows nothing about it speaking for this community and why are we allowing a small vocal community speak for the 100 million people who have played WoW through the years? 
---
Couldn't have said it any better myself. These guys might have some entertainment value to some but the Classic "creators" are absolutely clueless when it comes to this game and we shouldn't forget that.
---
So I take it you have no interest in the World PVP objectives either?
---
1-20 is easy, there's plenty of quests and they lead you naturally from one area to another. Just remember to read them, and you'll figure most out. If some remain too vague you can always ask in chat or look it up online.
---
20-30 is a bit tricker since you'll probably need to visit at least two zones, but it's still rather easy. 
---
Each race generally have three zones didicated to the first thirty levels. Ex. humans have Elwynn Forest/Westfall/Duskwood, Dwarves have Dun Morogh/Loch Modan/Wetlands.
---
30+ is where you might run into problems. Best tip is to explore zones and look for settlements. If you run out of quests or the remaining ones are too difficult, level elsewhere for a while.
---
&gt; The first big push for cross realm BG's I saw came from Asmongold who will be playing on a lopsided population PVE server due to him using a game for a occupation, while we work so we can play a game.
---
Your first mistake is listening to Asmongold, a broken clock who has had some great rants about wow, but otherwise reactions to other people's reactions.  It is much easier to argue an opposing point of view and shape it to be streamer-friendly than it is to speak out without any foundation.
---
&gt;Classicast, specifically Tip's Out and Esfand have tried to spin this as a good thing and have continually tried to sell it as needed, while ignoring that without a penalty for piling on one faction, nothing is keeping population balance in check.
---
Your next mistake is listening to Tips, who isn't old enough to have played Vanilla but claims he did, and Esfand, the evangelist for Ret Paladins despite the math proving him wrong.
---
&gt;PVE servers will be heavily Alliance slanted due to Blessing of Salvation already. 
---
Finally, you need to be at ease about balance. You seem to think that the audience for Tips, Asmondgold, and Esfand are indicative of the larger population that will play WoW. Here's a safe bet: they aren't. There will be lemmings who follow their favorite streamers to certain servers, but they will not represent the majority of the player base. These guys don't have that much juice with the wow community.
---
The tourists from retail are going to be only issue for faction balance and server population. 
---
That's what I remember too!  I could totally be wrong, but no one seems to have a solid answer on this. It's always I think or I'm pretty sure. 
---
IF/SW = Harry Potter  
---
Darnassus = Lord or the Rings
---
The thing is there's more server locations now than there were on launch... it's selfish, but I'm worried about regions like OCE + BR etc. If a 100% no cross-realm BG decision was made would mean those communities would have a much different experience to NA/EU in that PvE will be played locally, but BG's will be a coinflip based on queue pop at the time. (Kinda like live)
---
I can't help but think CRBG's will be a thing come launch, I don't want them but the smaller regions will struggle without I think. 
---
Uhhh I don’t support any direct loot trading which is closer to what we had than what is being proposed 
---
Cross Realm BGs were a result of poor server population management. Realms were quite literally 90% one faction and the Premaded farmed the pubs. Who stopped queing WSG and AB after a while. X-Realm BG were the first step in the down fall to community. While it helped for the later game with arena (on 9 or it doesnt matter). It was still shitty of blizzard to let the servers fall to that point
---
If they actually keep track of server pops this should not be an issue overall. On the other hand if they just fly by the seat of there pants again. It will probably become necessary unfortunately 
---
Thunderbluff's forge is so fuckin handy.
---
The gold sink is only a small part of it. When you put the respec at 50g in Vanilla you aren't really saying "haha people will have to spend tons of money to respec constantly", really what you're saying is "People have to either spec one way and only play that style, or be really subpar at the other style, OR chose a spec that is a compromise so you can play both styles but neither optimally". The third option of respeccing multiple times a week but playing 4+hours a week just to farm gold to fund it isn't really the intent. Sure some people do that but it's not the design. I think it's very likely respeccing would actually be a much bigger gold sink if it was 25g a respec, because then people would be regularly respeccing and over the months far more gold would be sunk into it rather than putting it at 50g where it's too expensive for anyone but people that play a ton.
---
So the negative of free respec is it undermines a character's identity. A warrior is just a warrior. In vanilla a warrior is not a warrior. It's a tank, or a PvP warrior or a dps warrior, that may or may not have the gold and gear to respec if needed. In practise what this means is most that don't have unlimited amount of time to play just chose one style and stick to it. So now I'm a fury warrior, don't ask me to tank because I won't. I might screw around in pvp for an AV weekend to grind something but I can't be bothered respeccing for it so I'm just gonna suck at pvp and that's ok.
---
Storm wind. My very first toon that never hit max level was a human and it was the capital I knew. 
---
I think you don't know that stance's are on a seperate gcd from the ability gcd,
---
I also think you don't know that you do really have to press the button twice for these macros to work.
---
/run local texture,name,isActive,isCastable = GetShapeshiftFormInfo(1); if isActive then CastSpellByName("Charge"); else CastSpellByName("Battle Stance()"); end; 
---
This is a double press Battle Stance, Charge vanilla macro no different from
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
/cast Charge
---
You have to press twice whatever Stance switch into ability macro you use.
---
Get a clue, you can't rely on macros to baby sit you through stance dancing in vanilla, it will only slow you down
---
It's gotta be Ironforge and I say that as a long time Horde player. I sneak in there as much as I can. Ogrimmar is a close second, and Thunderbluff is my third.
---
I was 12, but I was playing Warcraft 2/3 when I was like 9.
---
A big part of the allure of PVP servers is it starts genuine skirmishes between factions. I still remember people in SW using trade to ask for reinforcements! So even if there are some 60s ruining the fun for lower levels at first, it usually starts up a larger engagements which were really cool.
---
Have a lot of fond memories from back in the day duking it out around lakeshire as a level 20 something, plus some high level guildies if needed!
---
2.0 was the one leading up to TBC imho. 1.12 was more than 3 months before 2.0 and almost 5 months before the launch of TBC itself.  
---
Sure, it's "close" but it's still a significant time period. 
---
Irrelevant of design the location was just trash.
---
Today on a pserv  STV I hopped in while passing on my mount (40 priest) to protect a 32 mage from getting ganked by an undead rogue (40 ish) 
---
Instantly made up for all the 60s one shotting me from 31-40, the feeling of protecting someone and overcoming the another attempted horde’s cheap shot 
---
I gotta wonder if all the outhouses just involve shitting off the cliff.
---
Half my life ago I'm just realizing. First played in 2006 when I was 13. I barely played at all post-Wrath though.
---
Um...cross realm BG is Vanilla. Why wouldn't we have it? Although it was segmented to battle groups. We definitely had it back in 2006. I'm confused.
---
The only way BGs will work without them being cross-realm is if Blizzard implement some way of balancing the population on the server. I played on a server in Vanilla/TBC that was Low population, and of that Low population, it was 95%+ Horde. At any one time there would hardly be 100-200 max level Alliance online, and around 1500 Horde. Battlegrounds would literally have been unplayable without crossplay.
---
Interesting to see how Blizzard addresses this
---
I know what, you mean.
---
You actually watch Classicast enough to figure out what they're talking about?  
---
&gt;i'm in full on board no changes I DO NOT want loot trading
---
Pick one. Loot trading was in Vanilla via GM tickets, they are just streamlining it to save $$ on GM hours.
---
South Park bases their episodes on relevant things. WoW is not, and will never, be relevant again.  
---
&gt;Eventually we will end up with Alliance PVE servers and Horde PVP servers and dead WPVP and a stupid game revolving around queues like modern WoW where we sit in town all day to do something, because organic content has been killed
---
What do you mean eventually? That is a historical fact that it happened and they put it in that way. Personally i dont care about the streamers or where they play. Though i hope i dont play on there server. 
---
In the end this is on blizzard to control population much better than they did in the live servers. If they dont roll up low pop servers or allow servers to get 90% single faction. History will simply repeat itself and Blizzard will have learned nothing.
---
Blizz really needs to do something about faction balance on servers.
---
It's simply asking too much of people on this subreddit. Eventually you just get used to seeing the same five or six tired topics pop up over and over, occasionally interspersed by interesting topics.
---
My thought is who cares, because actual Classic hasn't even come out yet.  
---
I think white-text bonuses are flat bonuses (Means you will get +10 healing on abilities) where green text bonuses increases spell UP TO a certain amount (Means you will have a +1 to +10 healing roll each time you cast a healing spell)
---
The difference between a level-40 mount and insta-cast travel form is insignificant, especially when you are constantly stopping to skin kills.
---
TB and IF because they are the easiest to get around. Fuck Orgrimmars sprawl, and SWs stupid canals.
---
Cant dual wield anyway and your stats are gonna be bad
---
There are good reasons  why RP servers are the best.  
---
Not  sure if anyone mentioned these yet but naming rules are more strict on RP-servers... basically you cant have names that just would not exist in Warcraft Lore, such as "noobsmasher" or anything stupid like that.  
---
Those kinds of names can be legit reported. (same goes for guild names)  
---
Also you are NOT allowed to harrass those who are roleplaying, if you do that its a bannable offence. So if someone was to crash an RP-event then you could report them and get  them banned for ruining their community event, this has happened before if people still remember an infamous classic event when a guild had a member die and they arranged a memorial for him/her ingame but since it was a PvP server the opposing faction had idiots who went and ganked them all. (cant remember if it was an RP-server or not, but same thing... not sure if they got banned but on an RP-server they probably would)  
---
Atleast back in the day people were discouraged to play on RP-servers because they thought its full of weirdos. These days some kids still go to goldshire and think  thats all there is to it.
---
So that works as a deterrant too which makes the population in general more mature than that of PvP or regular PvE servers... and this is a fact! Ive played on all servers at some point, i started playing on PvE server and a PvP server... just like everyone i was weirded out by playing on an RP-server but eventually i rerolled onto one because my friend had done so and his roleplaying screenshots looked cool.
---
And i did roleplay for a few years but i havent done that since wotlk, mainly due to my server dying out and most RP-guilds disbanded.... my own aswell, which made me turn into raiding and ive never been able to get back into RP.
---
I migrated onto a PvP server during early Pandaria and i noticed pretty quickly how much more immature people were on there. The quantity of childish-names aswell as pointless arguments and general toxicity increased a hundredfold.  
---
Incase someone misunderstands that sentence: i  was not the one arguing or  being toxic... not at all, i was just minding my own business playing the game while reading general chats and LFR-banter.
---
Sure RP-servers have toxicity but its NOWHERE NEAR the amount of a PvP-server.... :)  
---
What does this have to do with classic?
---
Throttle at a certain temp, yes, crash or break at a certain temp, absolutely not. 
---
Apperntly nobody died overall. BGs was a FAR better way to get honor than roaming around the world. Most people like to blame flying for killing those moment to moment pvp fights in the world. But in reality it was BGs that pushed people to have Faster more consistant pvp.
---
Thats not to say WPvP didnt happen but blizzard never got it right in say a game like DAoC did.
---
Significant if veracious
---
Defias EU still going strong!
---
Without LFD people should still be able to login with the expectation of running a level appropriate dungeon and actually find a group and manage to do so. Without cross realm BGs people on low-pop/imbalanced servers will login to play BGs yet will fail to do so because the queues are longer than their available time to play. That is a massive difference.
---
You sad, strange little man
---
I agree. It's old, old forum etiquette that you search for your topic before posting it, but maybe I'm just showing my age. 
---
It's hard to believe its been almost 20 years since GameFAQs was poppin'.
---
The question will be for you as an individual. If your goal is clearing Naxx, I’d suggest focusing on that first and worrying about what happens next later. If you get a year or two of dedicated fun from WoW Classic, you may be ready to move on to something else afterward. And if not, you may be looking to re-roll a different class and go through the journey all over again.
---
Me too: i love the aesthetics, the scenary and the feel of Thunder Bluff.
---
Mine too. Although I have realized I like many of the dungeons others consider to be ugly slogs, Like LBRS and Gnomeregan. It's just got such a great atmosphere. A troll temple to an evil god who the dragons stomped on until it sank beneath a lake. I love all the slime, gross creatures, and hanging roots in there. It feels good to purge everything in that sick place.
---
Yeah I am seeing some conflicting stuff. Some say Aff-&gt;Dem-&gt;Aff-&gt;Dem until you end at 31/20, then I am seeing others that are a lot heavier in Demonogy.
---
I really don’t think we will ever see a Blizzard TBC server. I think Classic is it.
---
You make some good points. But ti seems that you are arguing that there is only one explanation for anyone to be "pro" cross realm BG and that is "because they are streamers".  
---
That looks like a straw-man argument. 
---
Especially when you go off on ad hominem attacks on some of the people who were talking about it.   
---
You act like they betrayed you when they discussed cross realms. (I listened to the same discussion you did... I think... your recollection of it seems a bit tainted by your emotional reaction from what one can gather from your post)  
---
Here is what I heard: "Cross realms BG will probably be needed down the line due to faction imbalances".  
---
That's not an unsound argument. "Cross realm fighting is more fun than NO fighting" is something a lot of people agree with, despite not being streamers.  
---
Obviously, as you also point out, Cross realms is not the only way to combat imbalanced BGs and long queues.   
---
And had your argument started there I think it could have been productive, instead of "these people are evil greedy streamers who betrayed me" (yes, your post reads like that. If you have issue with my reading of it, then ,maybe rethink your writing style...)  
---
Your points on the risks of "allowing" unbalanced server pops by letting Cross Realm Battlegroups exist are sound. There are real risks in not addressing the underlining problems.  
---
But boy could you have expressed that better than going on an anti-streamer rant....
---
Everything? 
---
Maybe not healing then, but the general randomzied item suffixes ([https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Item\_suffix](https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Item_suffix)) - (I do believe I found one with + healing on a private server) anyway, some of these give + fire damage for instance. Is the bonus applied differently from the green-text bonus on other items?
---
You are a **condescending** **fuckwit** who argues in such bad faith that it's not even worth addressing the few points you bring up because you will reply with a snarky remark and a half assed solution. Also you're completely wrong about loot trading only applying to greed rolls pre personal loot, I don't remember it working this way and here is a blue post to clarify [https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/) nowhere does it specify what you claim. I even vividly remember trading a guy the offhand warglaive in cataclysm on a need roll I won because he had the main hand and wanted to complete the set.
---
inb4 snarky remark in a desperate attempt to look funny
---
Can you link them actually talking about this topic? I don't think I have heard this before, but to be fair I have only watched a few episodes of classicast since I don't really find it useful enough to spend an hour+ on. 
---
I know Asmongold is lazy and it wouldn't really shock me if he wanted to make things easier for him at the beginning rather than waiting for the last phase when it actually released.. so you're probably correct. But the rest of classicast? I want to watch the classicast where they talked about it
---
No wonder all the harpies living below are pissed off.
---
And the music.
---
Only 90's kids will understand how important having sickass ASCII title art for your MegaMan X FAQ/Walkthrough was!
---
Absolutely. this is correct answer! 
---
99% of the time people are not  roleplaying... they are playing the game normally, RP is like storytelling people do together  with their own characters. Just like GTA RP if anyone has been seeing that lately, but WoW RP atleast back in my day was done purely through chat and no voicecoms.
---
I can see it if classic is successful. I only worry it will fragment the community if it isn’t handled well. 
---
Good suggestion. I do have one. Totally agree.
---
I'd definitely like to find a good, chill guild.
---
That’s such a massive grey area in my head as well
---
Noticable lack of Undercity love here....
---
Not at all. Just hoping to have a slight idea as to what to do. I'm leveling on private server atm just to test things and kind of ran out of quests are 21 on night elf side.
---
22 and in the Marines. One of the only things that made it bearable.
---
But would you watch it?
---
I remember a lot of people killed cats in the Swamp of Sorrows because they dropped whiskers that sold for pretty penny supposedly. Which is hilarious to think about at face value. Probably best if you're a skinner.
---
This here, WoW is way past being relevant even with Classic Hype, the original was at its peak when it was attracing masses to play the game...it can no longer do that as pretty much everyone that was going to either play it or try it out has.
---
Dont forget addons!
---
There are roleplay-addons people use in general which allows others to see alot more information about  your character and yourself such as if you are a new RPer or an old one and if you are IC or OOC at that very moment.
---
Addon ive always used was MyRoleplay. (i think its the most widely used)
---
Just take it out for a whirl on an RP-server and im sure youll be able to see other people who have it and what kind of characters they are.
---
Dont even need to roleplay, you can just go and read other peoples characters. :D
---
&gt;will IF still be the primary alliance capital in Classic?
---
It's way closer to Menethil Harbor and thus Kalimdor (Ony/AQ/DM) and to Blackrock Mountain (MC/BWL/L+UBRS/BRD) and the Plaguelands (Strat/Scholo), so I'd say: Yes.
---
Respeccing is essentially "remake your character into something different". I like that it's an option, but it should be a difficult choice. Otherwise your characters talent points, it's specc and it's role means nothing.  Just like the Action game that is modern MMOs. (as opposed to old mmoRPGs where your roles mattered. Your choices were yours, not the fucking "flavour of the patch" shit that is modern MMOs.
---
Everyones been on the same page forever at this point. Its too far away to know definitely, but if Classic is a success TBC is essentially guaranteed. There is a tiny chance of them adding in stuff like Kara. Thats the only alternative.
---
Agreed. I enjoy the rivalries that can build up with server only BGs. Seeing familiar names and getting to know people is what builds community
---
Ideally what they would do in about 2 to 3 years after classic release is release TBC with same model. But allow almost like the PTR to copy not transfer your character to a TBC realm so you can still keep a 60 only character and not force players into TBC
---
Cross-realm BGs sucked a lot of the joy out of BG PvP for me. PServers brought it all back by being single realms. Anyone who doesn't realise that the single realm is so important, is deluded.
---
If you're not fighting the same people as you see out in the world, then it's just not right. How can you develop rivalries if your BG opponents are almost never the same?
---
Yeah, the same thing as a shaman with talented 1 second cast ghost wolf. It makes having a mount way less of a priority, especially if you do herbing etc.
---
When people have Blizzards ear and when the former CM is their "pal" you listen to make sure they aren't going to ruin what you waited a long time for.
---
I also know their audience is very small in the grand scheme of things (see my original post that states 100 million people have played WoW). 
---
The idea that Blizzard does not use streamers in design is wishful thinking though. Blizzard employees have gone on record saying they do.
---

I thought classic was launching on 1.12 , would that mean including x-realm BGs will be keeping to no changes? 
---
Or would it make more sense to form battle groups some time after all the BGs release? 
---
This makes the world more alive, though. You'll have people in the world looking for World PvP while sitting in queues and have more world PvP.
---
5 months out of what 2 years isn't that signficant. 
---
Not before 1.12 no.

---
No body ever picks Darnassus..
---
If you have to ask about professions as a feral druid, then I really recommend you don't play a feral druid.
---
I still prefer those options over \#nodetails and \#nofeelings that are modern MMOs.
---
It’d be pretty fantastic. An episode of them getting pissed at fortnite/pubg/apex players and leaving to go back to classic wow would be epic.
---
This is not only considered one of the funniest South Park episodes to even non players, but the reason a lot of people started playing wow. Including myself.
---
A series of gaming episodes would be even better. The kids go from br to br until finally settling back on classic wow. 
---
Here's are my opinions:
---
1. If you've seen a lot of talk about "What comes after Naxx," why not just discuss it there?
---
2. Blizzard is very aware that if they forced Classic players to upgrade, they'd lose subscribers. 
---
3. Adding TBC separately from Classic will destroy the population and faction balance for **both** games.
---
If there are any rose-tinted goggles for the old days, it's for TBC, the game that brought:
---
* The beginning of homogenization of classes (and Wrath finished it)
---
* Flying Mounts, the end of world interactions (and the beginning of drop-in random PVP)
---
* 100% linear dungeons
---
* The birth of the Quest Hub
---
* The birth of Daily Quests
---
* Resilience, screwing PVE players on PVP servers
---
...and much more. Yeah, Paladin Tanking the GOAT raid (Kara) was fun, but TBC and Wrath should be laid to rest.
---
the fact all ops commented are downvoted a lot says everything 
---
it's obvious what the majority of the community wants : )
---
That is like saying Naxx should be available at launch, there shouldn't be an AQ opening event and on and on. It's a completely flawed argument and one that can only be made if you are selling snakeoil.
---
You misunderstand - they obviously aren't releasing everything at once, but the things they do release will follow 1.12.1 rules. We get 1.12.1 talents, 1.12.1 item stats, 1.12.1 battlegrounds etc. etc.
---
That was not the only discussion and all the push for it has come from this little clique. 
---
Poor Darnasus and Undercity, coming from Warcraft 3, those cities have the most lore, but WoW didn't do them justice. Mostly due to location.
---
TB for horde, IF for alliance. Epic music in both, and so thematically perfect for their respective races. Also centrally located for travel to pretty much anywhere on the continent.
---
It's a disgrace how these two cities have been cut off in BFA with the portal changes but I'll be making good use of them in Classic. 
---
MadSeasonShow = Best youtuber ever!

3. Many think spec was part of player identity and had a meaningful impact on the RPG element.
---
1.12 had cross-realm and is basically the single longest period vanilla actually went without being patched. So as someone who actually played vanilla, cross-realm feels completely authentic to me. I was on a medium pop imbalanced server as the lesser faction. Queues were always instant and it was actually really nice even before cross-realm, but I know it sucked for the Alliance on our server.
---
But if this really bothers people for social reasons I have an easy solution. Enemy team is cross-server, your team is not. So your queue is as long as it takes you to actually be social and make a group for the BG, the same way you need to make a group for a dungeon. And if you get queued with a random, that random is from your server. The other side should be basically instant for you most of the time. It is only if your server+Faction is truly dead that this won't work, but that is a larger problem Blizzard has to solve in general and not just for this specific case. 
---
&gt;Cross realm BG's belong in TBC where BG's are pointless, WPVP is pointless and where people afk to get a resilience set. They have no place in vanilla WoW and benefit no one except streamers and people on PVE servers who all want to roll the faceroll faction. If they want more balanced queues they can roll a PVP server, just like they did in real Vanilla WoW.
---
Couldn't agree more. I think cross-server BGs do not belong in Vanilla at all and are not part of my, or anyone I PvPed with for over 2 years experience with the game. Cross-server bgs were not added until VERY late into Vanilla at the very end basically, and by then the majority of people grinding to rank14, had already gotten 14.
---
Cross-server bgs were essentially a TBC feature and not a Vanila WoW one. Vanilla WOW is all about the community, and trading convenience for community is a bad thing thus everyone being against LFD/LFR, etc. Let's not trade community for convenience when it comes to PvP, too, please.
---
I remember rivalries, knowing the enemies I'm against, them knowing me, me knowing every person on my team etc. We made friendships, we made rivalries, we trash talked on voice chat, we had good times. it felt like a living, breathing world. It felt like a small community. Cross-servers killed that in 1 single patch.
---
Say no to cross-server BGs! Vanilla WoW = community. Cross-server bgs = anti-community!
---
Don't take it personally. In my case, these were 40+ of the most hardcore raiders on the server. Only a couple hundred guilds or so even cleared original Naxx. Most of them wanted a strong presence to get people to focus. Leading of any sort is knowing your audience and their dedication-levels. 
---
When I called targets for high ranked arena teams, I could be more assertive and direct. When I did so on "let's fuck around" arena teams, I had to pull back a bit. I'm sad to say that I didn't always get it right myself. :) 
---
That's like saying "I thought classic was launching on 1.12, would that not mean including Naxx, AQ40, BWL, upgraded PvP gear, t0.5, ZG, Diremaul, AQ20 will be keeping to no changes?"
---
It's not Vanilla, it's the final tail end of Vanilla.
---
MadSeason has taken Archeology in WoW to a whole new level!
---
and you would also have to be group leader..the lengths people are going to defend loot trading just because of a possible misclick..lol
---
No kidding. I can’t even stand click on an asmongold thumbnail due to his terrible reaction faces being stamped on to it. 
---
He might have one of the most annoying faces I’ve ever seen. 
---
As a die hard hordie I voted Org ofc, but I was very tempted to cast it on IF.
---
Okay, but would you watch it?
---
So are you saying we should also have no AQ opening event (that has already been confirmed), no phases (already confirmed) and a delay before BG's are released (already confirmed) that all mimic original WoW's experience as would no cross realm BG's since they weren't in the vast majority of it? 5 months out of 2 years becoming 2 years isn't no changes. Anyone stating it is is selling snake oil and obviously trying to manipulate their audience. 
---
Streamers have ruined every game I've played, and kind of why modern online gaming is such shit.
---
Undercity. Because of how easy it was to navigate. I suppose Ironforge is similar but it seemed to me like Undercity was better. 
---
It’s my favorite.  
---
Is that the book with all the abbreviation? 
---
Thanks for the response. I'm getting older myself (as much as I hate to admit it lol) so maybe a RP server would provide more people my age.
---
So glad to hear it! I remember it was pretty full when I left some five years or so ago.
---
I got rank13, my friend got rank14, tons of my friends I PvPed with got rank12-14. None of them played during cross-server bgs. We all PvPed and played WoW for ~2 years.
---
1.12 might've been the longest patch, but it was also the very late into the games life-cycle and cross-server bgs were not something you experienced for the majority of vanillas life.
---
&gt; You are a condescending fuckwit who argues in such bad faith that it's not even worth addressing the few points you bring up because you will reply with a snarky remark and a half assed solution.
---
U mad lol.
---
&gt;  I don't remember it working this way and here is a blue post to clarify
---
Blue post from 3.2. You realise it was changed after 3.2, right?
---
This was fixed at the start of WoTLK when athene used to to get world first 80.
---
Was it on ysera? :^) 
---
There's a difference between delaying content and cutting. 
---
As a fellow Warrior, I trick I've learned during my PServer escapades is to always outlevel the zone you're in so you're always doing green quests. Being 3-4 levels over the area you're in will let you breeze through quests (but still get full exp), pull multiple mobs, and stand a fighting chance against other people in the zone. 
---
The easiest way to do this is to level in ALL of the starting zones. It's not the fastest method, but it makes leveling a warrior much easier. 
---
For example: as a human, I'll do all of the level 1-5 Elwynn quests and then hoof it SW, ride the tram, and run to the Dwarf starting zone. I'll complete those quests and run to Menethil and ride the boat to Auberdine and then Darnassus. I'll do all of the Night Elf starting quests 1-12ish and go back to Dun Morogh, and finally back to Elwynn. 
---
I keep alternating back and forth like that until I run out of "race specific" starting zones. 
---
Elwynn &gt; Dun Morogh &gt; Teldrassil
---
Westfall &gt; Loch Modan &gt; Darkshore 
---
Ashenvale &gt; Wetlands &gt; Duskwood
---
...and so on.
---
Ensure that you never do yellow quests. If you run out of green quests, move to the next zone. 
---
Would I watch it? Absolutely! They wouldn't do it again though. With that said, I am hoping to see new vanilla fan videos like they used to make but with today's quality and editing software. 
---
No, cross-server bgs were added VERY late into vanillas life cycle. As I've said a few times in this thread, I PvPed with others for  2 years straight and there was no cross-server bgs until the very end, where  most of us didn't even PvP or play anymore. Vanilla WoW was like 3 years, so MAYBE 33%(being incredibly generous) of the game had cross-server bgs? That's not good enough, it should be 0% in a true classic experience.
---
I can still remember my specs in DAoC when i went to RvR. The top guilds we fought in WPvP and BGs before X-Realm.
---
I cant remember a single thing about the last 3 expansions of wow other than i played them to some level and im not even sure of that.
---
It would be awesome. I know some of the staff used to play WoW as well, and could just see them making an episode based on the Nostalgia of WoW. Going back because Classic launched and just making jokes about it. Your idea is good too, them playing the BR games would be in the beginning then they find out about Classic WoW and make the switch haha. 
---
Yup. Anyone representing less than a quarter of a something as being the only representative of something and "no changes" is purposely manipulating and misinforming their audience, especially when the rest of classic being lovingly created to mimic the original experience as much as possible.
---
I don't want anyone speaking for me and think the community should decide (and they were initially very against it and seemed to think it would never even occur to Blizzard to do this), but I really don't want people that come across as self serving and dishonest speaking for me. 
---
I hope that Classic has a playerbase so we can fill atlest 10 servers. However, HOW many people are actually intrested in playing a 15 year old game, that have NO changes from the original game?
---
There is the old playerbase, many of which are 20+, got jobs and lives. There is the current retail playerbase which we see as tourists. How many people are actually intrested, which havent played WOW before? How many of them will continue playing an old game? 
---
I understand alch/herb was pretty good. Am I wrong?
---
That late??? wtf.
---
Not sure, been a long time since I cracked this tome open.
---
Yeah I’d watch it too. I secretly hope someone on their staff is aware of Classic and has this idea. 
---
How would you feel if we got x-realm battlegroups later on down the line? Like it or not they were part of the vanilla experience and omitting it wouldn't be keeping to "no changes".
---
I dunno about you, but in twink bgs we had plenty of rivalries going on in cross realm BGs. Well, when it was just Battlegroups at any rate--dunno what it's like these days.
---
40-50% is fair for a good ret in my experience. Checking the top rankings on legacyplayers where the LB rogues are barely 800 dps through BWL and the paladins are 350-400. That’s Naxx patch. 
---
On ND (AQ patch) a friend of mine is at 328dps as ret, and the top 30 warriors start at 800dps. 
---
This is top performance only, so expect to have much worse warriors and rogues in the average guild - meaning a good+loyal retribution paladin can be a valuable asset. 
---
A retribution paladin can also slap on a healing set for rough encounters. I’d say it’s *viable, but not optimal.*
---
That's great if that's what you want to do, but personally I'd rather play 3 premade BGs than run around opportunisticly ganking lowbies/pve'ers for 2 hours waiting for a BG that never happens.
---
I threw mine away when TBC was released. I have been searching on eBay for the classic guide book. 
---
People like TB? It looks nice, i guess, but holy hell was it annoying to navigate.
---
Are you from a native English speaking country? If so they will have an easier time then I had. I started when I was 11. Turned 12, 3 months into Vanilla. I got to 60 without much knowledge in English. I understood a few words such as 'Hi'. Nothing advanced at all. 
---
As I said, I got to lvl 60, I raided AQ40 and did pretty well for myself. Knowing the language will benefit them alot.
---
The only reason cross realm should kick in is if and only if a reasonable amount of time has passed and the server has been unable to start a game. I think that's reasonable, it is a game after all is said and done.
