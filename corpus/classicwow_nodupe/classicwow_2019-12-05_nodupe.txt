oh god this is going to be /r/wow 2.0 in a few months
---
---
---
Now wipe the spit off your chin. Here’s a plate of tendies and a coloring book.
---
I was lucky I sold it for 15 too. TBH I got it late in the game since I got it on my second character and I actually said out loud 'of all the epics in the game, just keep the luck give me a goddamn green'.
---
Why do anything?
---
Yeah his whole speil is he enrages every 15 seconds. Just Scorpid sting him, melee 3 times and wing clip out, wait for enrage and repeat. I’d wing clip gets parried scatter shot him and wait for the enrage before engaging again. Ez pz fight. Other players is the problem.
---
You need to chill.
---
Lol what server were you on? This is backwards from most peoples experience that I've heard of. Way too many rogues and not enough tanks (warriors included)
---
Damn! I hope u get in before it closes dude!!! Good luck!!!
---
dude for sure that's the plan, i'm ready to roll through this content since i didn't get to back in the day
---
Boom counter-spell. Rip jimmy
---
not exactly if he has a history of hate speech I'm less likely to believe him if he said he didn't commit hate speech it's logic.
---
As the guy above said, mostly Earthshaker - but some went to Bloodfang too. The Coven, Loot Dispute and Bad Habits definitely moved across here and there's probably others I don't know about.
---

---
Looks like Earthshaker is going to be the same as Flamelash was, except this time around you guys get to be part of the 70% :P
---
I mean, on one hand you are right, if people do want to be raiding and performing well in high-skill content they probably should do research. That includes asking people in-game, that's research too. Not doing research means mages needing on plate armour because they genuinely didn't know they couldn't wear it. THOSE people should definitely put more work into learning the game, I agree.
---
But on the other hand, you specifically mention debates surrounding "class/role/server type and how it impacts endgame", and that's much blurrier. I personally am of the belief that not every raid needs to be 1000% hyper-optimized with every single player having the perfectly tailored build that was perfectly theorycrafted after 15 years of research. I hate the sort of people who complain about the EXISTENCE of balance druids, tank paladins, or shadow priests, saying "No, don't play your class that way, you have to play it THIS way. Druids are NOT healers, Paladins are NOT tanks, Priests are NOT DPS. Play your intended role!"
---
That sort of stuff right pisses me off. It is a videogame. An RPG to be precise, and if a class has the ability to perform a certain role, like Druids having healing spells or Priests having damage spells, the player shouldn't be generally pressured into not touching certain parts of their arsenal because they're "Suboptimal". Let people experiment and enjoy playing the videogame they're paying $15 a month continuously to play. Not everything needs to be "optimal" for you to enjoy playing the game. My favourite run of Dark Souls 2 was done at level 1 using only a spoon as a weapon. The absolute worst possible case scenario of letting a paladin tank for your party is you wipe a few times and the group disbands, wasting a few hours of your time. That could happen just as easily with a prot warrior tank who's bad at the game, or if your healer kept getting distracted, or if your DPS kept getting greedy with their AOEs and pulling threat.
---
I'd much rather have someone playing a "suboptimal" build well in my party than someone playing the internet-tailored build badly, as it shows the former is actually engaging with the game's systems more. Being willing to experiment and do their own thing is a sign of deeper understanding of the game's systems than just "I saw this BIS tier list online and it said this trinket was the best one so I'm using that one" or "the levelling guide I read said don't buy demoralizing shout so I didn't, I didn't know it made this boss easier".
---
Alliance here, you should really stop making us look bad.
---
Lol, how is it not good practice to play against potion users? Its what happens in pvp. Lol are you for real?
---
He’s right hit isn’t everything. Need a good mix of mitigation and hit. Easily done with the some gear. 
---
Devilssaur set plus true strike shoulders is 4% hit right there. Then you need only 1 % and focus rest on defense, agility/dodge or big stam to take the hit. 
---
Bears can feel squishy because they can’t block so over all can take a little more damage than plate + shield. However They have an ok stam / armor buff buff to help survive the extra dmg you take vs a warrior for example.
---
Piggybacking here - is there a way to macro profile changes? I hate changing the profile on several addons at a time.
---
It's ElvUi in case anyone else was wondering. Trying to figure the unit frames past still.
---
Also hardly anyone quests there, I would guess.
---
Livin his best life until the tree burns down in 15 years.
---
Or you can be in guild chat "hey I need scholo, anyone else needs"? And then you go work towards a goal together with somebody else who does.
---
You still have fun, but in places that also give you something
---
Really? I play shaman heals for raids and i would not consider it the most diverse healer in pve. We have a lot of utility but I guess the current state of raising is very 1 dimensional, ie you will mostly be a chain heal and totem bot
---
Is phase 3 Dec 10th with the BGs?
---
in pvp, you will get hit in melee quite a lot.
---
The whole point was to encourage Germany to invade through the marshy low countries where they would be bogged down while French forces were mustered. Getting Germany to invade through Belgium also helped to ensure that the UK would definitely enter the war instead of trying to sit it out as they had pledged to protect Belgium's sovereignty.
---
The fortifications did exactly what they were supposed to do.
---
Probably but, if it's different profiles for addons that change different stuff you would have to figure out the / command for each addon and then just lump it all into one macro/button. Which addons profiles are you changing each time?
---
In my experience most people just ask questions like “anything To know for this fight?” And it’s usually a 2 sentence reply and it’s all good. Getting someone to watch a video, skippingto the part that’s actually relevant, is a way longer process.  A raid where you could be wasting 39 people’s time is a different story but for most 5 mans I don’t see the problem with just giving a brief explanation.
---
No, they just release it earlier. Like what happened with Dire maul and phase2. P3 prob comes late jan orso. Early 2020
---
Luckily now it is only a name
---
Plenty of rogues roll on caster daggers if it's a dps upgrade lol.
---
they did confirm today it will be the 10th :)
---
I believe you can still command your per when you are polymorphed so sap is probably the same.
---
Eh, shaman may be one of the best contenders for spriests. I mean spriests are one of the easier strong duelists out there, and you'll have to work harder to kill a spriest than vice versa, but our kit as shaman can really counter a lot of what they have. Throw on a shadow reflector and its trivial
---
Orc Warrior here - I did this quest 9 times before it worked....  
---
Granted it was worth it given that I still use the armour is yielded - still, the horde feels your pain int his quest too, or at least I did.  
---
What server are you on, can we organise a no kill?
---
That notion was bolstered by the addition a bit later of the percentage stat bonus if you're wearing all pieces of "your" armor class.
---
I think I've come around to warriors/hunters etc wearing leather if it's best for their DPS, but for some reason I think it sucks when healers and other casters who can wear leather or better are stuck in cloth.
---
I was feeling the same until I got to around 50-55 and started duelling better players and level 60s. Those players use your small misplays and momentary (1sec) windows to turn the fight, and if they do, like you said, it’s hard to turn around again. 
---
So basically don’t feel bad when you stunlock perfectly and your opponent didn’t even get to move, because he very well could have turned it around in a second, and it will happen eventually.
---
Bartender, Luna Unit Frames, Quartz, and Details all at once would be the shit. I was hoping there was a commonly used pattern for profile swap commands so I wouldn't ever need to look it up per addon.
---
I’m Alliance but Undead Mages are 100% KOS on for me cause you know they’re all cocks irl
---
[removed]
---
This explains a lot.
---
&gt;Everyone will be playing orc hunter
---
:rolleyes:
---
&gt;Melee classes aren't really played until the end game.
---
you're gonna have to remind me what we're talking about here
---
&gt;I also like that 40 man is closer to flex raider, when you can just bring whoever you want and just carry them.
---
raiding is supposed to be difficult endgame content that requires players to invest time and effort, not a theme park. what are you talking about
---
&gt;I think the 5 mans are really trash, even the HC versions
---
you're gonna need to explain yourself here because a lot of the 5-mans of tbc are still amazing even by 2019 standards
---
&gt; Farming badges just becomes a huge chore
---
which is more of a chore: farming badges for guaranteed gear, or farming arena/baron/ubrs/tribute/name your poison 5 resets a day for a 4% chance at your bis piece?
---
because that's what badges were introduced to fix
---
&gt;I also dislike portals everywhere in Shattrath
---
portals were placed in shattrath to address the complaint that you need to go to x capital city for a handful of things but there's otherwise never a good reason to be there, thus requiring you to either spend 20 minutes on a boat/zeppelin/whatever or beg a mage for a portal. unfun gameplay was replaced with an easy solution.
---
&gt;I dislike how small outlands is
---
outlands is giant? what are you talking about
---
&gt;it makes Azeroth basically obsolete
---
yes that is the point of an expansion???
---
&gt;I really dislike summoning stones because again, they make the world smaller. You just get summoned everywhere
---
again, addressing a "class x is required, not because it's stronger or in the meta, but because it has a utility spell that's too convenient not to bring" complaint
---
&gt;Alliance not being a faction
---
what are you even talking about
---
&gt;no longer having to buy water from mages.
---
this is a *good thing*. hello warlock flair, i'm priest flair
---
I've dueled lots of people, and it seems a pvp specd sl lock can just afk win if they know what they're doing. Now shadow reflector does change this a lot, and will be necessary to have any chance vs someone of equal skill and gear, so it is doable in my experience. But if you're easily beating sl locks, they're bad
---
For warlocks, not much.  You have to get the jump to win a fair fight in my experience. The dots are too much to handle if you're not going for the one shot and the one shot is really hard on a stamina heavy caster with a lotta lifelines. Personally, I like to try to go for the kick on immolate, or if you're lucky shadow bolt - this will make it so they can't cast shadow spells for a while. If they have the imp of succ out, I like to kill it if i can if I'm not getting feared - this removes any of their ability to use their pet as a resource. If it's a voidwalker or felhunter just ignore it. Try to make it a long fight if you can't end them quickly. Blind, get out of range if you're not already feared. Try to reset if you think you have a chance, try to get the fuck out of there if not.  
---
For shadow priest, the strategy is similar but IMO it's a little easier as they are easier to one shot and are more negatively affected if you kick their shadow spells. While they do have some sustainability, it's nothing a blind or stun can't change IMO. What's trick is, again, when they spot you from range and open up with a dot. As soon as you get in range you'll get feared.  
---
For both, grenades are clutch. Iron grenades from engineering 165 are really useful, and if you think the priest or lock is gonna wanna go for the fear and you're not in range to kick, get that grenade up immediately. It might save a blind cooldown.  
---
And for both battles, try not to waste vanish. It's really easy to do so with dots on you, but if you time it right sometimes you can make it work. If the dot ticks every 3 seconds, get the vanish up immediately after you take your tick, and then you can get a cheap shot or ambush off while you have some precious time in stealth. I can't  tell you how many times I've panicked and vanished only to immediately pop out of stealth.
---
“Wow is a team and and requires cooperation now go watch a dungeon guide so I don’t have to talk to you noob idiot”
---
TIL darnassus is a capital
---
I found I did more damage with auto shot.
---
Enrage, Scorpid sting, auto shot, auto shot, wingclip, back out to range. 
---
Repeat.
---
If you just won Bonereaver's you have the best 2h fury weapon available. You only need 5% hit for 2h so stack AP and crit after that. You'll need to use bloodthirst and WW on every global while weaving in slam. Get a swing timer addon.
---
I always thought they should have create really REALLY rare book that teach you other language outside of common, so an orc could speak gnomish etc .....
---
Stack stamina and agility. You want to survive rogues/mage/shaman openers and still be able to do damage. Gear should come easy and there is loads of good mail gear in scholo. Aim for 4.5k hp without buffs (should be easy) and around 25%+ crit.
---
**For people that have KUI:** is there any way for you to see the time remaining on the debuffs displayed on the plate of KUI?
---
People ara dramaqueens exagerating, its pathetic
---
Stop making low effort posts.
---
subtle tyler the creator reference?
---
&gt;  I understand setting it late in the phase schedule to better simulate the vanilla experience but they should be clear about it so people don't cry where is my keyring every time they patch the game.
---
I believe it's not just that, they literally have to patch it in. We're on the legion client and the key ring, doesn't exist anymore. It was outright deleted from the client. So they have to re-engineer the thing and they just said "in a patch later this year." (That was said in october or something iirc)
---
But absolutely, should have been a LOT more clear about it.
---
I have never gone the whole ambush crit/backstab route. How hard does the crit usually hit on the ambush? When cold blood is active.  I know this is based on gear so what is the damage around  with the current gear available? And backstab is easy to run PVE since the tank has the attention of the mobs. Is backstab a pain for pvp or are you using something else as combo a combo point builder?
---
As a level 12 mage your market is only ppl lvl 14 and below not that surprising you’re not able to find many ppl interested
---
(Your lvl 20 water is usable at 15, same with your 22 food)
---
why didnt u intercept ?
---
But Mu'ru was way too hard.  It was such a major roadblock for the majority of guilds until it was nerfed.  Truth be told I took a break from WoW "for personal reasons" when my guild got to pre-nerf muru.  Really I just didn't want to bang my head against the wall.
---
By the looks of it you arent even 60. You are below lvl 30 even. Just reroll.
---
No, I expect people just to know their list and if it is not on theirs just ask if it is ok to roll.
---
And yeah best does not mean only, but why should I not get the best option? When deciding what dungeon to do this evening why wander aimlessly doing whatever?
---
If I have the option to do something that gives me the best item or something that does not why would I take the second option?
---
You are advocating ignoring BiS lists for no reason. 
---
Looking up what items you need and working towards them has no downside.
---
Hmm, good point. I found it convincing because of the Shan'dralar in Dire Maul, and maybe the Cataclysm's impact on their home. Then again I stopped playing during WotLK so I have no idea.
---
lol this one is good
---
Earthshaker "had" roughly the same or more allis as flamelash but way less horde (nearly 50/50)
---
Bloodfang seems to be around half the population of earthshaker.
---
These are rough inaccurate figures but the only source we have. 
---
Ironforge.pro 
---
They get the data from raid logs
---
Is there a way to transfer other than from the queue screen? Because I want to transfer but didn’t get a queue tonight, and can’t find another option
---
Going to bot on another server ey
---
Well I know you can buy gold from shady websites but that goes against the TOS and will probably get your account banned. That's why I said legal, is there some other way to buy gold that I dont know about?  
---
  
---
I disagree with you, I think using all the tools at your disposal is part of being skilled player.  
---
If you have problems with people using certain items and options it sounds like you have [the scrub mentality](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win). Not trying to insult you, that's just what it's called, give it a read and you might change your mind.
---
I’m on Whitemane and I am scared of there being queues forever but also don’t want to go to low pop arcanite reaper, anathema, earthfury. what should i do?
---
That's mail
---
Rogue is nothing like what the private server players said rogue would be. Its useless in most situations, pickpocketing may as well get removed from the game and farming gold is impossible due to horde controlling every inch of azeroth.
---
So i need something that:
---
1: Is not a mage
---
2: Is not a warlock
---
3: Good at premades
---
4: good at open world pvp
---
5: actually wanted in groups
---
6: can actually make money in some way
---
That hair is rad tho.
---
All of these posts, but no one's explaining how or why or even what's going on.
---
Just to clarify: The server isn't actually dead, it's just that Alliance are taking advantage of the Free Character Transfers to get off of the imbalanced server?
---
This has happened on many other servers, and it still leaves a sizeable Horde population. Not sure how that makes for a "dead server" or even a "first" one.
---
sounds like we just have different opinions. If you need all of your cooldowns and a deathray to win a fight, you're a scrub. But that's okay.
---
Cool how does that help me now?
---
warriors who wear leather pee sitting down i hear. maybe it's just rumors though
---
Jerkin of the Monkey
---
man that's a dilemma right there. I hate these million stealth wolves so much...
---
Yeah was fun watching.   
---
Reminded me more of my Warrior levelling weapons though, miss, miss, dodge, parry, 2 dmg, miss, miss, ...death
---
Just set your hearth to Darnassus. Kalimdor is your new home. Grind mobs in Azshara until you hit 60. Don’t try to kill the Satyrs or Blood Elves, they will be on constant farm by the Chinese. Just get to the beach and farm murlocs and crab people in the north east. These mobs are pretty decent for farming and have a small chance to drop epics and golden pearls.
---
You don't know what you're talking about.  Tirion does all the work.  Standby and collect your reward.
---
You sound like you know what you’re talking about. So how long have you been botting?
---
I think you still need 9%for PvE. 5% is for pvp.
---
You people are insane. I was going nuts getting my Atal'ai shoulders from ST and ~25 runs felt like a shitload. I can't imagine farming the same dungeon 920 times.
---
Especially for an offhand that's getting replaced in a week.
---
Wait, I thought they made the transfers available only to horde right before phase 2?
---
I didn't see any of this coming, but I realize that I am a big dumb 30+ year old casual gamer. Your explanations make a lot of sense to me. I played Vanilla back in high school and all the way to Cata, and then I dropped it. I didn't know private servers existed because I got busy with other things and moved on.
---
So when I saw that Blizzard was bringing back Classic, I was excited and I got some of that good nostalgia feel. I started watching some youtube streamers to learn some of the things I've long since forgotten. I was dumb because I kind of unconsciously expected that the rest of the world had grown up with me and forgotten everything as well. And when Classic released, I was like, "Wow! I remember this!" I thought it was the same for everybody.
---
It all came crashing down for me and I started to wake up when I realized that some guilds downed Rag in like the first week. I even heard through the grapevine that they could beat these end level raids with some players as low as level 58. Can't confirm, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. But regardless, that is when I started to see signs that this #nochanges Classic was just a dream. I was one of those deniers who didn't want to wake up.
---
Now it's even more obvious. It's a mistake on your part if you're stuck in the Matrix and don't want to wake up. It's the same reason why I suck at online FPS shooters. There is always kids on summer break or some no-lifer who maximizes everything. When a dumb casual gamer  like me with brick-like reflexes picks up a copy of the latest Battlefield or if I decide to jump onto Overwatch after more than a year, I always get steamrolled. So I either have to grit my teeth and keep sucking, or devote the hours of brutal practice it takes to make it to the top, which I don't have.
---
Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. I thought I was resistant to it when I didn't fall for Disney's shameless money grab that is known as Star Wars. But you're susceptible to nostalgia when it comes to things you really cared about in the past. Hence why I fell for it with Classic.
---
games trash until blizzard implements a fix, balance populations, cap on horde/alliance, w/e. at this point dont think it matters, just fix this stupid shit
---
ReEEEEEEEE Classic is only for boomers who have sweated the game before!!!111 No new players allowed in my *perfect* game
---
I think that item is trash for rsham.
---
dude, ZF runs (esp GY) are still great exp until 53. Better than mara, better than any phase 2 questing. Its not hard at all. 
---
It's after 53 that's a problem.
---
Link broke
---
This is absolutely false.  He does not need your help.
---
Nah they're top 3 played. Mage Warrior Rogue in that order.
---
This comment thread kinda proves my point.
---
Mostly in gaming forums you have people being so petty and nit-picky like you are being about such a simple comment. Disagree and move on bud, like most normal people do.
---
See ya.
---
Link? It’s embedded for me
---
As a mage I don't think it's actually worth it since you're really not getting hit all that much. My mage friend has a freezing band and I rarely see it proc for him. That being said, I've had 2 on my resto shaman for quiet some time and I really like them. Since we don't have much mobility and can tank quiet a few shots from melee they proc a ton
---
I was thinking the high level dungeons like Strath and Scholo particularly because there are not enough tanks in the game and people really don't care about greens. You could always just whisper offers to people LF Tank and they can either accept the offer or say no thanks and you don't have to worry about getting flammed in chat. I guarantee 90% will gladly accept to that.
---
I play on razorgore and this server is very even, cant the alliance defend them selves? :DD
---
What will you say when eventually there are extremely few Alliance to kill in the open world (and your BG queue times are out of this world)? It’s pvp? It’s ok? Pvp happened on a pvp server? Well your pvp servers will feel extremely barren at point. Best of luck getting the honor level you want when there’s really no one left to fight.
---
Flame guard Gauntlets. Just got them last week, have been trying to figure out how to replace the 2% hit loss from not having my Devilsaur set anymore.
---
The more the bleedin’ merrier!
---
On the bright side, helms look pretty cool in Vanilla and will hide your bald spot.
---
Found an Undead Mage
---
This is the alliance defending themselves!!
---
Yeah, and the proc screws you if you ever want to aoe farm.
---
The loneliest until we get TBC (if we get it), then every NPC in Silvermoon City will be lonelier. That place never got any traffic.
---
yes, they're the lowest mobs to drop it

Thank god for forced personal loot in retail because of guys like you.
---
Loot councils + spamming one spell over and over for a "rotation" damn I wish I subbed classic
---
Judging by your gear you can’t be that high level. I’d just reroll.
---
They always spawn uncleansed. If you come across a cleansed plant it is because somebody else already cleansed it. The plants do not despawn after being harvested, they linger a while and can be looted by multiple people
---
Wow fun game. Thanks horde!
---
Yea I ya a level 29 warrior that I love might just stick to that
---
Well in that you have to experiment yourself. You must know what kind of style you like from playing other games. If you want fast paced, interactive, explosive combat you could go mage/rogue. If you want to be versatile and adaptive you could go shaman or druid, if you want to be super useful to your team in a group setting, theres characters for that, or you could choose many characters for solo play.
---
You have to find what you'll like, because what's fun for me may not be fun for you. 
---
I personally love my shaman because I had a good leveling experience, being a versatile class, and a 30 minute resurrection, I was always desired for dungeons as either dps or heals and ppl love totems, I had lots of utility for all the interesting situations I was in, I could res people, which is fuckin awesome, I could have fast travel speed at level 20, because I absolutely cannot stand leveling while walking around everywhere, and I had a 15 minute hearthstone to easily get around places as I pleased while having the ability to be desirable and even strong in all end game content. 
---
But my next character will likely be a mage because of what my shaman lacks- high mobility, cc and many means to regen mana with a super fun and rewarding playstyle. But theres 10 million mages, so they're aren't as useful in my experience, although they're probably the most useful dps class.
---
Very funny but no. Ne druid and gnome lock (thus the wondering of the hate)
---
Kick them from raid. You don’t need that 1 extra DPS. Set expectations. If people don’t follow they get punished. Real simple.
---
I rolled a troll warrior because I thought he looked cool.  Min-maxing is not important, play what you vibe with.  Playing something that “feels right” is way more important than doing marginally more DPS in my opinion.   Besides no ones going to not take you in a pug or raiding guild because your race isn’t technically BiS, and they do... well... “Das racist!”
---
Do you have a statement from Blizzard where they said the caps now with layering gone is 6k?
---
If you do please link it. If you don't, I don't believe you. Simple.
---
Yep this changed the vanilla gameplay for I think the entire lifespan. You're shoehorned into instancefarming for gold because the population is way too high to properly sustain any other farming in the open world. 
---
A giant unfixable fuckup unless they lower the caps right now and have people forcebly transfer off by having 10k queues. At this point in time people will transfer more easily having already been through a queue-fest before.
---
Yeah, don't study or anything before you take a test.
---
mfw someone on the forum suggested alliance should only be allowed to transfer too realms like skeram to balance them out.
---
people dont fc as feral, you fc as resto
---
&gt; Thats just bragging.
---
Let me break it down for you.  Tech people that are qualified to work at a place like Blizzard make a lot of money, accountants need to make sure that whatever they're paying their tech people will be recouped via subscription fees and still have plenty of room for profit.  This means actually charging for the back end IT shit in the monthly sub and I bet they do it at a profit because they're smarter than you are, a lot.
---
whitemane is just a slaughterfest on both sides tbh
---
That's because they share spawns with Basilisks. You need to kill those as well. Probably you need to kill everything but harpies.
---
I agree that people shouldnt be shamed for their choice of spec...but they're also not entitled to raid spots.   And what I'm referring to there is that people should be aware that their choice of spec will influence whether they get to raid or not.
---
Like...if you don't bother to google it, you would be forgiven for thinking the big plate wearing paladins could wield a sword for dps or tanking in endgame.  But a google search would tell you that you're going to be healing.
---
I don't think those people should be complaining about elitism when it's well known that those specs are not accepted by the community.
---
Not true.  I’ve camped the spawn many times while getting felcloth—never cleansed them.
---
And you get a raptor mount
---
I'm still waiting for all of these 'nochanges' players and Blizzard itself to admit that increasing realm population size to 3-4x the old vanilla max was an incredibly fucking stupid idea and is probably one of THE worst changes they could have done.
---
It's such a shit show on any realm thats a solid medium or higher pop.
---
Not to mention all the warriors who shoe up for their quest. I had some ele fires drop while helping my warrior friend get the axe. Would have gladly traded them for the items we needed of the guy there farming hadn't called me all sorts of slurs for being there.

This. /thread

Is there any addon replacement for felwoodgather? :)  
---
" FelwoodGather helps you and your team mate with felwood fruit gathering, location and timer management. Whipper Root Tuber, Windblossom berries, Songflower, and Night Dragon's Breath are available. This addon's main purpose is the timer management for each objects easily. "

It’s good in that it is unexpected, but convenience wise, I can just run back my corpse easily. GY is just there in UC. Camp the “In Dreams” questline. Kill them before they get Taelan to the tower. Or camp the hag near chillwind and kill them as they get the disguise. They have to run all the way from the Bulwark to their corpse AND wait for the quest mob to resonance. It is the absolute, most cancer escort quest I can think of.
---
Should have rolled pve
---
You trying to set me up for a woosh?
---
My man
---
It very much does suck ass, but anyone else who has gotten Exalted with Darnassus on a non-Night Elf for that beautiful saber mount has visited this AH many, MANY times
---
Fly to burning steppes instead
---
Gotta say a hard disagree on this one. Im on the 4th most popular server in EU and the game is fucking dead before 4-5pm.
---
Finding and forming dungeon groups is either impossible (lack of tank mainly) or takes 30-60 minutes. And what comes to pug raiding you have exactly one chance to find a group at 7pm. If you miss it you have to try another day.
---
I seriously cant even begin to imagine how it is on a server with 4x less players but I definitely dont want to be a part of one.
---
I’m in the same boat.  There just aren’t that many people in the level range of an instance.  Only times I find groups are peak hours and weekends.
---
I'm arguing against using "check wowhead" and "use google" as catch-all answers to everything. Though in this case I'm probably comparing apples and oranges.
---
Ill miss Venture, they always kick our butts at BRM.
---
That's me with UD rogues. *Every single one* has been an asshole.
---
Thanks for the proof but how do u get that much honor in just one day?
---
Ironforge and Dwarves
---
You did this to yourself :P
---
Ah! I thought that was a neat little addition to that quest! I definitely picked up and sold/ate every piece as well
---
I’m 41 now. I’ll just wait until wrath :(
---
Had something similar happen. We were riding out as 40 and a level 50-something from the opposite faction was riding his slow mount in front of us. Our raid leader on discord tells us to just ignore him and ride by, but just as the raid passes over him the little fucker dismounts and frost novas about 25-30 people, followed up by 2 ice blocks.  
---
He eventually died, but with a smile on his face I bet.
---
BiS lists existed in vanilla, not many people followed them but I remember following one in later vanilla.
---
I really, really hope this happens
---

Make friends with another rogue. One goes hemo and stun locks. The other goes daggers for big crits. Can kill anything while also CCing a bunch of people.
---
Right but I'm wondering if I can create a macro to change profiles so I can setup full UI changes on a single key press.
---
What are the best spots to find some group PVP going? BRM is probably the most fun I've had doing PVP but I'd like a change of scenery
---
It's for a wine shop, not the bar.
---
saf*er*. there will still be horde around but usually not a rogue right next to the innkeeper.
---
&gt;Rough estimate on how long/expensive to get to mining 275?
---
A guildmate of mine did it in 3 days buying ore from the AH, then going out and mining. It just depends on how much time you want to invest in it. 
---
&gt; I decided to switch and was curious how long it’ll take to level
---
Getting to like 150 is pretty trivial, you can breeze through zones and get heaps of gains from smelting.
---
After that you're basically stuck looking for one node type (e.g. Iron &gt; Mithril &gt; STV &gt; RTV) until you hit 300, the rare nodes (Truesilver, Gold, Silver) spawn but it's not realistic to farm them since it's much harder to find them. 
---
&gt;I’ve seen that you can smelt to around 125 or something like that.
---
You can do this in like &lt;10g by buying ore from the AH, but going out and mining isn't too difficult (it's pretty quick with an epic mount).
---
Yeah this is definitely untrue. They spawn uncleansed quite often.
---
I do - because it's hilarious
---
Nice try Undead mage
---
I got the popcorn out and watched shit go down on Flamelash tonight, and it was like a stampede for the exits. Most of the people left in IF are level 1 alts warning / taunting people who want to stay. It's like a ghost town, whereas the image daudleikr posted above is entirely accurate for what Earthshaker looked like earlier.
---
You're talking a swing of 500+ of the most active Alliance players moving to your server in one day with more likely to come tomorrow when they realise all their guildies are gone. Unless the horde from Flamelash also move to Earthshaker (which they are probably too cowardly to do) then I reckon Earthshaker is going to be massively Alliance heavy from here on out.
---
Maybe I'm just being overly dramatic though, who knows?
---
If they did allow alliance to free transfer during phase 2, the realm would be completely dead already.
---
I thought they are making you spawn where ever you were when you enter the BG? In that case you would have to fly back to town to queue then back to the harbor. Am I mistaken about that?
---
&gt; but no matter what you gonna do, there's gonna be more horde then alliance
---
well, in an alternate timeline, you start limiting new horde characters.
---
If ya'll weren't EU, I'd say come join the fight on Smolderweb, where its only like 42% Alliance, and we're all havin a pretty good time
---
Fury warrior have no special claim to Thunderfury. Rogues have more tools to dump the threat it generates.
---
That's good reasoning. Now consider that duels \*could\* turn out the same way 1v1 without each party needing to spend money on health potions. 
---
Eventually, with this reasoning, a line could be drawn to determine said skill without needing to waste consumables or cooldowns. Eventually you get to the idea of honor dueling, which goes all the way back to the very first MMORPG. 
---
World of Warcraft eventually adapts the same concept some seasons later with arena restrictions.
---
Nice! I always love finding epic items. Too bad he’s not a gnome, lol.
---
They can ride it
---
Blame retail and twitch when 99% of the problems are caused by 3-5x server populations
---
You can consider trueaim gauntlets if you have alternates for your other hit slots, as long as they are statted for more damage. Like crit instead of hit on bracers, or maybe the DM W quest helm instead of mask of the unforgiven, that kind of thing.
---
&gt; Earthshaker, good ratio and population
---
But it won't be if tons of people flood to there from other servers..
---
If a world boss is up, Azshara/Blasted Lands explodes with action on my server.
---
EPL is always full of ganking.
---
Winterspring and Gadgetzan too, but a lot of players on my server abuse the deadspots so I wouldn't recommend these.
---
That's the best hairstyle for undead imo. I have the same but with purple hair since it brings back memories of a certain boss. 
---
*Good news, everyone! I think I perfected a plague that will destroy all life on Azeroth!*
---
How to make ~150g in 20 seconds!
---
Nope
---
Can’t help with that.  Best I can offer is typing /bartender and 4 mouse clicks.
---
Difference is, for PVP there's a PVP solution. It's unrealistic on many servers, but technically it's there.
---
When we're talking about an area where you instantly get swarmed by elites when you lose your disguise, I don't see any solution outside of getting a raid to kill a single player.
---
It was 2 to 1 all along, until p2. Plus blizzard fucked up with two waves of free migrations, until they locked ally and basically doomed them.
---
Nope. You chose it. Gotta live with it. Such is the classic experience.
---
Not on this subreddit, and the mods here do not have any power. So yes please submit a ticket :)
---
Happy honor killing!
---
Stonetalon mountains have an absolute horrible graveyard and it is extremely punishing dying there. That’d probably get a few people pissed at you
---
No snark or sarcasm, just an honest question, what was your expectation/narrative for the PVP situation?
---
Yea and when you post on Reddit claiming to be 2nd best judging by speed runs it auto procs no matter where you stand, best to stand on the cracks I hear
---
Did you make it or did you find it in the website? I wanna learn for raid nights but it feels overwhelming
---
What does Mok'gora mean?
---
Why? It's the Vurtne hairstyle, wear it with pride.
---
Yo, I've been leveling an alt on Earthfury (usually on Incendius) and it is so much more chill. The world pvp still exists but it's not like I'm worrying about scouting before I rez like I normally would have to.
---
Earthfury Horde is legit.
---
Cooks much quicker over Troll fires than man flesh too
---
If I had a penny for every time I've read "LF1M Tank then G2G" I would never need to work again.
---
Easy there baba ganoush everything's going to be just okay.
---
This is PERFECT. I'm quite unfamiliar with horde cities so this will be a fun adventure. Thanks.
---
Yep.
---
Yo i’m west coast US though isnt earthfury gonna be laggy as shit for me?
---
He said a few things. Basically you definitely need 2/2 Intensity talent  and all you really do is hellfire the entire pack you're tanking.
---
  A priest is decent if they know what they're doing but he said he really prefers a paladin for concetration aura. It can be a DPS or healing paladin though so it doesn't matter.
---
  You also want to stack as much armour and defensive gear as you want e.g. Ring of Protection, Naglering, Mark of the Chosen, Force of Will, 2 pieces of the T0 that give armour, Sergeants cape (PvP cape) and maybe a Warden's Staff if it isn't too expensive.
---
  Armour potions work too. You can either go soul link for tankiness or deep destruction for fire damage, with demonic sacrifice for maximum threat.
---
  It requires a good amount of gear to pull off, but he &amp; a paladin do Strat Live runs and they reserve orbs and do really quick runs. (Source: Elli on Alliance Shazzrah)
---
He almost died for me to the first pack outside the Barracks and the pack of spear-wielding elites on the road towards the end killed him. His attack speed wasn't as high as the guy I saw do it before me so you seem to have to hope he gets that attack speed buff if you want to let him solo everything. Comments from 2005 on wowhead were also saying that he's a wrecking ball but he wasn't doing much DPS any time I did the escort so I had to Smite his target and it worked out just fine.
---
I tought there wasn't a epic mount training right now
---
Only a epic mount
---
It's 9% for raid bosses though. 6 as human
---
The 5% hit is for pvp, pve should still be 9%
---
Legit question: can Horde even get to Teldrassil?
---
Check south Tanaris where you do the pirate treasure map quest for level 50+ bots some nice free honor there.
---
2-3 days played of the bg? Or a decent amount of hours for 2-3 days?  How long in hours does it take?
---
Just transferred my warrior there.  Looking forward to it.
---
The atmosphere and the music are what truly make WoW a great game.
---
SW auction house is in an non descript door off the big square of the trade quarter.
---
How much should I value 1% crit on a leveling rogue?
---
I am hoping to get shadow skin gloves, which offer +6 Stam and 1% crit. I would be giving up +7 agility and +8 strength from my current gloves. I have the recipe and some of the ingredients, but the shadow cat hides might take a while to farm. If I can’t get them very quickly is is worth investing the time?
---
Take the back door entrance (follow the river until you almost reach Aszara, there's a bridge going over the river), the road leads to the  valley of spirits, the large hut on the left is the mage portal spawn TA DA. People will spawn in the top half, and immediately jump down, taking fall damage. You can 1-shot them. Once they die and release, they will have to walk from the graveyard in front of Org all the way back in, up the ramp hang a left and THEN get their body. It's a bit of a trek to say the least.
---
ENJOY!
---
Just get Unforgiven's mask from Strat.
---
It cracks me up how obsessed everyone is with bis lists, while at the same time talking about how easy the raids are
---
I don't know what you asked in guild chat but the answer is most likely ALT + F4
---
&gt;as private servers had up to 18k and worked fine with that population.
---
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought Blizzard was on board with #NoChanges.
---
If I knew the game was being changed around Private Server fuck-wads I would have never subbed.
---
&gt;The cap isn't 10k, its 6k.
---
My point still stands.
---
How is the climate on alliance side on Heartseeker the last two weeks?
---
Takes way longer to level mining than herbing: drop herbalism.
---
JFC. Rogues are the 3rd or 4th most popular class in the game.
---
I'm from South US. I actually have no clue where the server is hosted.
---
Imagine if you were playing a first person shooter like counter-strike but anyone could choose terrorist or counter terrorist with no limit, but once you picked it you were stuck in that game.  How many games would end up 3v7 or some shit and just be horrible.
---
Requiring overall game balance is such an obvious core requirement, I don't know how Blizzard couldn't realize the importance of it.
---
Wow.. I wouldn't have sent anything to that jabroni. What a crock of shit
---
Was it 10g or 8g he put up? It switched
---
Yeah thorium grenades are useless /s
---
Pretty sure it’s 640g
---
Warrior raid BiS is currently a mix of mail and plate with leather wristguards (that are pretty meh for rogues anyways).
---
Wait until BGs on the 12th, will very much likely tone down the world PVP.
---
There's plenty of places in org you could wait at. There's always at least one human rogue in org on Pagle and frequently 3-4.
---
my fave that i saw was a druid healing the kul tiras marines south of ratchet
---
No I lied
---
That’s why they call it the present... wait... that doesn’t work here does it?
---
Shadow oil is like a sharpening stone though and will override WF? 🤓
---
nope
---
What you mentioned shouldn’t have even gotten a GM involved, so I’m guessing it’s whatever you didn’t mention that’s getting you banned.
---
Would've been cooler if u didn't showthe direct conversation with the enemy.. but props to them for upholding
---
XD
---
Is there a reason it seems like they are all UD? Like do UD have a racial thats best for rogues or something?
---
As a Horde who recently hit 49 on a new character due to friends deciding to play here, this saddens me.
---
So your guild has been deciding since september?
---
what is that picture from? it's a memory that died from too long ago
---
Yes, they can hijack the boat and sail right to the village
---
Nah, it’s nice being able to travel to BRM without dying once
---
Top's correct.
---
If you're not going to answer the question, don't. There are generally more than enough people who are willing to help new players, so you can just stay silent instead of cluttering up chat even more with a response that's neither informative nor entertaining.
---
And, when advising new players, or being new and asking for advice myself, I find players tend to give information in much more clear and concise in the context answers than online guides do.
---
By kong time you mean 2 months lol? &lt;3
---
WotF, but that's not going to do shit for my SS and Freezing Trap. Also, undead are 'edgy'. The certain type of player who will camp you even after you give no honor more often than not happens to be the type who think being a corpse makes them look cool.
---
That last part was unnecessary bud. You went from making a snarky point to being a douchebag.
---
I just downloaded bartender. How can I adjust the settings to show the keybinding letter/number on the ability icons?
---
If you read the post, im saying that they gave 24h between announcing closing down the transfers and actually closing them down.
---
True. Fair enough
---
again, if you read the post, we have been debating for 1 month.
---
Lol someone told him to sit at a metal concert and he sat.
---
You get ganked in Red ridge too, don't ask me why but I died three times there turning in one of the Ony attunement quests. Every time I've flown out of red ridge I've been ganked at least once. It isn't faster. Honestly TP is probably the fastest with Morgan vigil sometimes being faster. 
---
The slowest part is where all the pathes meet up. With you usually dieing there 2-6 times depending on your class, how well you know the run, and how many horde are there.
---
I guess. I always make it to brm in 1 or less death going in from redbridge.
---
To my fellow priests:
---
Any tips on gold farming in shadow spec? Trying to grind for my 100% mount, have some downtime before raid next week. Respecced as shadow and looking for some high gold/hour farm spots. So far I have read:
---
- Mauradon solo
---
- Tyr’s hand
---
- Felwood satyrs
---
Obviously with PVP, looking for a low risk area as well. I’m herb/tailor if that matters as well.
---
Thanks!
---
The rogue should take the leather and the warrior should take the plate, because the group collectively just went up by 17 instead of 10.
---
Horde will just wait til cross realm BGs come out next week.
---
This is ridiculous. There are so many slots that simply don't have good plate options and armor doesn't even matter in raids. Just because you don't have "access" to plate doesn't mean you own leather.
---
No, they're both about game knowledge in general. The first uses BIS gear as an example. The second is salty that they're being told off for giving useless non-answers.
---
They are a jack of all trades so gives you a lot of options if you suddenly want to heal or some shit. Stealth is nice for pvp and flag carriers are always in on the action. Just something to think about
---
https://wago.io/-WCbLx83B
---
this one works pretty well. I copied some of the code from it and combined it with another weak aura I used so I can see my rage and swing timer together represented as a circle instead of a bar
---
stealth doesnt help your tanking ability at all. you cant even stealth in combat
---
I’m joining now
---
Im a horde on Flamelash, didnt really partake in any of the gank-squads, only PVP'd to defend myself as im a prot warrior, but i am curious - what has it been like for alliance?
---
"Aaaaaaaaaaay blyaaaaaat!!!"
---
Wow thank you. You just rocked my world. Never thought to right click it and it seems most people dont know about it.
---
Veggie Tales
---
I would argue its easiest place to farm for them. It costs you nothing to farm them, but I feel like the drop rate is very similar with felwood elementals and thorium point. The downside being that the other elementals actually fight back unless you're well geared and more gank squads.
---
Just yesterday I got 7 elem. Fires at TP elementals under one hour and some heart of fires. (Probably just good rng)
---
Although I dont know the precise drop rates, but on my personal experience, I feel the drop rates are very similar 🤷‍♂️
---
My bad, misread your post. Are those civilians even attackable without being at war with the goblins though?
---
Hey right on, can't wait!
---
You've wasted several minutes of your time by googling. Meanwhile, there are plenty of people who are happy to answer in less than 20 seconds.  
---
Your time is not less valuable than anyone else's.

time is money

Ya mon, trolls be da best race mon
---
Knocked Loose
---
Nice
---
I honestly don’t care what people say. I just think it’s funny when people get upset because others don’t like what they say.
---
Hopefully they leave.  Don't need that crap in the guild.  Had a dude like this that was just annoying as fuck.  I quit that guild and am very happy my new guild doesn't have any beggars who think they're owed help EVERYDAY.
---
Someone just found out why their bots gear is broken
---
I have done that too many times and am so happy to hear that I’m not the only noob.  Congratulations on 60 that’s the real accomplishment!! Plus everyone (except you and me perhaps), have red felt hats out there, so we can stand out in other ways!  Lol. You should feel happy and proud.
---
I make no secret of my disdain for some of the sub rules and how posts are handled. But I am just one of many and agreement is hard to come by.
---
IDK why anyone expected differently, over a "long" period of time, the vast majority of retail PVP servers evolve into PVE ones.
---
Nobody wants to be in an outnumbered faction. Its not a new lesson, its one we learned in ACTUAL Vanilla.
---
I bugged a hunter bot in Hinterlands, dragged it all the way to WPL in the Ruins of Andorhal and he was stuck in a permanent death loop. Took me about 30 minutes
---
or that smelting was a process you could do in the game and that was tied to mining and that process turned ore into bars.
---
You seem upset. You okay?
---
Thank you :)
---
I think you have it the opposite. You should just answer simple questions. Tell them to google complicated ones.
---
thats what some private servers did
---
The proc isn't unreliable though, it procs all the time. Over the course of a strat live run the other night I did about 7000 natur damage. Over the course of an MC raid the damage is significant.
---
You've had over 6 weeks decide. Unfortunately your procrastination is your own doing
---
Missing the point to be pedantic, nice one
---
As a counter argument: there are way too many people that join a guild, raid log, and do nothing whatsoever to help the guild or it’s members.
---
I'm horde on Smolderweb and I love it, especially since i actively read all the grievances on reddit about how alliance are totally fucked.
---
I dont pvp outside of who I find while questing (currently 56) and when heading into BRM I regularly get my face kicked in by alliance.  Sometimes it takes me 4 or 5 deaths to get in and sometimes I'm able to pick up a couple hundred honor in that time just picking off a clothie from the pack before getting crushed.
---
I'm always relieved when I see huge alliance activity across multiple guilds at BRM.  The sub here makes it seem like it's horrible across the board.  The smolderweb gang seems good though.  When I see people wrecking solo alliance I remind them to take it easy; we dont want to be like Skeram and trash the game for people.
---
It's nice to communicate within the game. It's fucking lame as fuck to tell people to Google something
---
Click “shop” at character screen. Should say “free transfer” if your server is eligible
---
&gt;Why is spell damage not listed under stats?
---
It's not really a stat like STR/DEX/INT/SPI/STA so I figure that's why it has its own section along with crit/hit.
---
&gt;How great would it have been to have archieved both today. No one beside me needed that item.
---
It's a nice hat, but honestly I wouldn't worry about losing it.
---
&gt;Now please tell me that it doesnt matter, because better items will drop constantly, so I can feel better. Thank you!
---
If you have Ony attunement it's pretty easy to get the T2 helm which is really nice.
---
This Dungeon was a rollercoaster of emotions. If everyone has one it can't be too hard to get it again... I hope.
---
6 weeks, you had a ton of time to decide, shouldn't of waited so long.
---
That is not part of a 60's job dude. If they choose to do so great if not, well that's life. Especially since being 60 unless they're doing level 48+ content they're neutering the xp gains of the low levels. And at least the way I read the post it sounds like the guy complaining is new to the guild and only asking for help for himself. 
---
Fuck if my GM told me that was part of my job as an officer was to essentially boost lower level players(that we don't know if they're going to stick around after hitting level cap), as well as raid leading and recruiting for the raid roster, while also making sure I know the strats were going to use, being able to make enough gold for my repairs and respec costs, I'd tell him to blow me.
---
Asking questions is not being carried.
---
When they win the fight.
---
There were so many bots that he was getting the honor from separate toons
---
I discovered this on accident some time ago, hilarious lmao
---
Yes, this will solve the problem. There is no way anyone would bring hundreds of lvl1s via summons into BRM and tank honor for everyone just like with this eye strat.
---
r/amitheasshole 
---
I would go with no, fuck entitlement. It’s a game, you get out what you put in.
---
Glad I sold my char for 800. Cancer server.
---
If the server was sleeping, how did you log in?
---
Go watch youtube videos of Vurtne (who had the same hair), and you’ll start to appreciate your baldy magnificence
---
This is old as hell, but it's worth knowing that, with world buffs, 6 piece outperforms raid gear with raid/world buffs.
---
I run 6 pc with ACLG and NS helm.  I'll transfer to NS shoulders once I get shadowcraft hat too.
---
Care level: who
---
You only get 2 dragons this way though.
---
Either of the zepplin towers. The one infront of UC is best, an even better, prime real estate spot is right where people land from the gromgol zepplin.  
---
Reason is that youll be flagged coming from stv and everyone just jumps off an instantly loses 80% of their hp, nobody is surving a crit ambush unless your weapons really suck, but if thats the case just go for clothies. Idk how alliance rogues dont hit the highest rank possible this week by simply farming that
---
&gt;Alliance Grouping up to kill horde
---
"Can't the alliance defend themselves?"
---
Do you mean, can't the alliance go one at a time to BRM when the horde is there with a full raid?
---
Tldr: We couldnt make a decision until pressured to do so by a time frame. Its blizzards fault we procrastinated for a month.
---

His point my dude is he can't even try to do anything else.
---
How does deadmines compare to stockades in terms of xp at level 15?
---
You're days away from things mostly going back to the way they were before the honor patch. I'm frustrated too but it's going to get much better soon
---
Fireball ONLY FIREBALL.
---
World PvP is just... Sad this time around. The faction balance is just so off on some servers the minority faction doesn't even engage sometimes. I charged someone that was full health and they just sat there and spammed a laugh macro. It honestly happens a lot where people just awkwardly stand there and spam shit at you.
---
Priest tier gear has a ton of spirit.
---
Ye and if they make TBC, its gonna be 90/10 % on all servers i think sadly
---
so can we get rid of this spammer or?
---
What do you mean? It's players themselves causing this. As soon as there's 5% faction imbalance allies just afk in IF and complain and soon later quit/transfer off. From there it's just a downwards spiral of quits and transfers untl the server has no allies on it. It's the same scenario on all the servers becase there's more horde players overall, worldwide.
---
Stuns use melee hit. Blind maybe not.
---
It *should* be that after 10 kills an enemy becomes worthless.
---

So when I went to get the crests for my we axe quest, all the mobs were dead and I saw a 60 orc rogue sitting there on his mount; remembering the posts I had seen here, I asked if he had any crests to spare and he immediately traded me 11. Saved me a shit ton of time and I didn’t have to fight for the mobs.
---
he's on fairbanks
---
Damn, imagine being this wrong about a 15 year old game.  Why even bother being a prick when you can be wrong AND a prick?!?  Just ask this guy.
---
Yes but you can kill them, reset and kill again. You'll be able to farm them non stop.
---
BC Classic will bring full ala carte server transfers and even faction change service, just like it did before.
---
i litterally put everything that happened in the post to messages and actions done
---
Did you play on Kor’gall by any chance?
---
Well that. And the Tauren rogues lurking around!
---
Fuck off dude.
---
The one occasion anyone has ever seen where either faction is acting honorable and you gotta be a little shit.
---
it was 10g he paid i get to keep 2g for the Stock runs so he wanted the other 8g back
---
Will do!
---
thats what  i thought so i was SUUPER confused
---
Surely 920 ST runs gave u more than 1g a piece. Im confused. You wouldnt even have time elsewhere to spend the gold.
---
MAK'GORA!
---
For Alliance on RP-PvP servers, you can say this via the cross-faction translations.  Maybe you'll run into an honorable Orc for once!
---
Used the Darnassus AH to sell my golden pearl. Shit was lit worth 30 gold
---
im hoping since i did send him his money back i can get unbanned sooner than the time given
---
WHAT?! That's amazing! I'm using this in the future!
---
Take a gold!
---
Which seems like a boneheaded move to stop these transfers. What are people stuck on underpopulated realms supposed to do? Get camped wherever they go?
---
Seems like a great way to get people to quit, and Blizzard is nothing if not motivated by sub losses.
---
only 5 resets/hour though. and half the time they don't drop anything at all.
---
I'm getting salty seeing that Paladin aura on the ally side warrior lol.
---
Dangit, meant to say mouse over targets!
---
The last few sentences is how I look at the system. Wpvp is fun, but I can’t stand the grind.  A few hours a week to break up the gold grind is good for me until BGs come out and those who have the same goals as me get burnt out.
---
Wow I don't know what I expected...
---
how hard can it be to learn how to take a proper screenshot?
---
Blaming the consumer for using your product wrong and not fixing it themselves. Imagine still defending blizzard/activation
---
I'm surprised they wouldn't just hand you the charms to get you to go away. I went to farm some Winterfall E'ko, and a hunter on the mount straight up offered me 10 gold and 5 firewaters just to turn around and leave.
---
HOLY SHIT MY FIRST EVER GOLD, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!
---
This isn’t accurate. Shit happens and an aggressive priest could take mana off a druid. But either way. The comp was far from top tier, but it did work, and was fun. Would basically farm double dps comps and do half decent against some of the healer comps. Particularly the ones with warriors. Did horrible against hunter or lock variants.
---
I don't want to be a dick... But are you even playing classicwow? Why are you weighing in on mount prices after 3 months and you don't even know what you're talking about?
---
I'm not even trying to be a dick, your confidence in wrong information that is extremely basic is just really weird this late into the game.
---
You got me there
---
Thanks, I didn’t see the other 3 identical posts!
---
Huh, counter strike must be a lot different these days. From when I played (pre source), I believe  the AK was T specific and the M4 with the silencer was CT specific. And the difference was quite meaningful (because the AK was significantly cheaper but served a functionally similar role).
---
You sound like a jackass.
---
Most of the bosses maybe but razorgore is going to be tough to pug and chromaggus &amp; nef aren't push overs.
---
Yep, which meant mind control added injury to insult, and if you were about to unavoidably die even with an opposing faction player's help, the nicest thing for them to do was kill you.
---
Don't worry, those people are losers and get all their wins in game. =)
---
My friend, it sounds like we had the SAME EXACT EXPERIENCE, just a few levels and zones apart!   
---
I feel like we need to get each other Christmas presents now...
---
Oof
---
In the Trade District, same spot as on retail. The door is just off to the side rather than across from the bank.
---
It's faster for me, sorry it isn't for you. Doesnt mean it wouldn't work out for someone else.
---
I don't see that blue sinew boy
---
isn't that what pve servers are for?
---
This happened to me. I killed a group of them so much they manually took over and killed me. Good times.
---
None of this is worth shit since, when you go elsewhere... it happens there too.  When you join a group to push through an area... well now they just bring more.
---
You're Horde, aren't you?
---
Most items do not have this issue. For SGC however, it is a bit different. Warriors wear that till what? AQ40? Where hunter wants full T1 (due to the set bonus I believe) and can end up replacing it on raid day. Not everyone who talks to you about different types of loot and about why maybe the warrior should get it are being elitest. Some are just thinking about how much it would suck for that warrior to lose his best piece till phase 5 to a hunter who will replace it on Tuesday. It's an odd item and most items are not nearly as rare so there are far less issues. We have warriors in our guild with well over 200 arena clears looking for it.
---
Gonna happen to a lot of servers. Even beyond faction imbalance the population is still going to drop off a ton. Best to play on one of the full servers imo
---
 Nice
---
China's tentacles reach far,wide and deep
---
Well it's the best way to farm this offhand solo. I just answered to a guy that you don't have to kill anything but those two dragons. I'm not saying everyone should do it.
---
Ahh that one guild where people ninja MC loot.  
---
Nice \~  
---
And obviously scripted.
---
I totally agree with this.  We have to propagate the attitude we wish to see in any group of people, and the guild is a perfect example of that.
---
This is commonly a leadership quality, but it doesnt mean you have to want to move into a larger role in the guild.  I like to be the guy that will help out a group of lower levels once in a while.  They really feel good about the guild and it makes it easier for them to answer the call when they are in a position to help.
---
There isn't. So for those (following how rank 11 mounts are) you would have to get that specific riding, aka get fucking exalted with the faction
---
This is very well done and would answer a lot of people’s questions.
---
I do want to point out that BGs will really shake up standings in a variety of ways. Premades will be much much more efficient than solo players, whereas solo gankers are currently able to gain honor faster than most. Also, on PvE servers, the pool of active PvPers (and thus the size of all of the brackets) will increase substantially with BGs introduced so active 60 players will probably be able to gain ranks a bit faster on average than they have so far.
---
Grobb was super high pop and had a great community, what happened?
---
it *is* rude. People aren't unaware of google, and the game is a social one. Some people like answering questions and helping people out. 
---
Ask yourself why you feel the need to interject in /1 instead of just ignoring them and going about your business?
---
To be clear, I get your point. Wouldn't it be faster/better for them to do research? Maybe it's just that you like doing research, I know I do. We're not all the same and in my opinion you're just stressing yourself policing other people's game time, and you should just chill, baby, and  let people play the game the way they want to. :)
---

I'm not asking how is doing more damage. I am just trying to find out what weapon speeds (MH and OH) are optimal for DW Fury

---
People play casually and learn as they go. not everyone plays WoW and obsessives over every detail
---
So, priest t1 set has low stamina? LOL.  
---
And do you really suggest that he just casually walks into a PvP store and buys Champion's Investiture day 1?
---
I'm talking about Taelan dying. Obviously, Tirion does not die and will do all the work once he spawns which is on a one minute timer after the death of his son at the tower when the Scarlet ?? mob spawns.
---
Ah haha, well thanks for looking into it for me. I might try it out and see how terrible it is.
---
Welcome, have talked to a lot of you and your GM already :) lots of new patterns horde side on our server now
---
close eu too plss
---
Aren’t horde pvp servers the same thing?
---
wish i did but they text went out of range since during my carries the other people would loot the bodies so it wasnt there
---
could you elaborate?
---
Risky click of the day
---
It's still like that
---
Good bot.
---
That's on your guild for being so disorganized.....
---
I was once on a bus, when a homeless man started masturbating. The bus driver got on the speaker and said "hey man, who's going to clean that shit up when you're done?" The homeless man shouted back "I am!", just as he started cumming. After that, he pulled a spray bottle and a handkerchief out from his bag, sprayed his clothes and the little bit that got on the seat, wiped it up. Pulled out some disinfectant wipes, wiped the seat again. Got out at the next stop. No one on the bus said a word. I think we all had a bit of silent respect for the man.
---
A few stops later, someone boarded the bus and sat in his old seat. No one told that person what had occurred. What's the point? It was clean as hell.
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that Gorski_Car is not a bot.

In the past if they wiped on azuregos they would try to pull the boss into other raids so other horde wouldn't get it.
---
If can be kind of hard when you are at work using the reddit mobile app and the only picture of my character is one I took on my phone. Sorry I offended you.
---
Unless it’s changed since I played cs:go, the ak was cheaper and better. Same ammo capacity, harder recoil, but one shot headshot through armor at all but the furthest of ranges and as you said, cheaper. It’s like horde get a 110% speed mount for 75% of the cost of ally’s 100% mount
---
lol :D
---
Sounds like a you problem. Thats 30 days for your casuals to log in. Problem solves itself.
---
Yeah that's on you, not Blizzard.
---
Wowhead usually screws up my game / latency, and is annoying to sift through. So yeah, I ask the community questions first in game because that’s what chat is for - communicating. If you are looking down on people for asking questions in chat, seems like you have some sort of personal problem (this is not directed at OP, just at whoever wrote the second post).
---
People need to chill.

In the meantime... One of the other 10 raid guilds killed azuregeus :D

Xiv player from all here, so players can just attack each other at will if they're in differing factions?

STOP BEINGS DICKS
---
PVE HAPPENED ON A PVP SERVER!
---
If you want to raid as well I would recommend 1 point in expertise. If not then I would probabaly do imp kick as someone suggested.
---
That'll be the final nail in the coffin for the unbalanced PvP servers.
---
Yes, absolutely. It's really weird that they'd go through the trouble of bringing a high level character to stop people ganking their bots (I mean, the point of bots is that they have hundreds of them and that no matter how many times you kill them, they always keep respawning and farming).
---
When I was playing on some wotlk private server a bit before classic, the same thing happened to me. There were a ton of bots everywhere, and they were the most obvious shitty bots ever, so I decided to kill them on sight. Killed 5 of them about 6 times each when a dude came directly at me with his flying mount, not just in a random way but as if I was his target. He then camped me for a bit before leaving. I continued and another one came. Thanksfully, they were shit at the game so I was able to just bring my main.
---
Multi-gold?! DAAAAAAAAAAAMN! You guys ROCK! I'ma go mess with botters now.
---
I've played on a PvP server since I started playing WoW in BC and quit in the WoD prepatch. Not once have I ever seen giant deathballs and roving gank squads all over the place like this before. 
---
Even on Timeless Isle and other zones where WPvP was ENCOURAGED it was not even half as bad as this. 
---
Also, on PvP servers most fights were small 1v1s over resource nodes or quest mobs. 99% of my deaths now are just groups of 2-5 fully geared level 60 Horde players backpedaling while spamming AOE spells on my solo level 50 ass. There's no "danger" or "excitement." When I get killed by this bullshit it doesn't elicit anything more than a sigh from me because there's literally nothing I can do to fight back.
---
i played the actual vanilla and lvled 1 char on a priv server, the only murder squad you would come across was the 10 man horde premade that was waiting for WSG queue pop at like 2-4 in the morning. Even then it wasnt a complete zug zug shitfest, we had some nice duels and people were mostly chill, most of that squad made it to R14
---
This made me realize that even though there are 3 auctioneers in the Ironforge auction house, I have been going to the same one since the game was originally released
---
LOL
---
Wtf a wow cookbook, that’s so awesome haha
---
how is playing 10+ hours  a day something to brag about?
---
But then those are the people who complain everyone is toxic.
---
There's been a few posts here where someone has complained of asking for directions in a dungeon and no one replies so the group dies, in that situation google a map and look for directions it's possible no one really knows which way to go and if they tried to guide and were wrong no doubt they are scared they will be called out.
---
Then I've seen one person here post about being kicked from a group because they got lost and couldn't find the entrance. You can ask for help sure, the person probably did and the group probably got frustrated trying to direct the person but there's also youtube clips and guides of every entrance in the game they could have quickly looked up if stuck.
---
There's some instances of people being toxic and not helping new players, but then there's also just instances of people expecting others to go out of their way for them with things they could easily solve themselves and then they label the community toxic over it.
---
focus on your work and not about trying to get upvotes on reddit.
---
That's a roundabout way of suggesting something that is not common knowledge.
---
Did you get banned or "banned" by someone impersonating a GM?
---
dude kurinaxx isn't even that imbalanced, it's one of the more balanced servers. it's at 55/45. even if it is 50/50 and perfectly balanced, you're still not going to be able to quest, it's still gone be a massacre just more even. hate to sound like a broken record but sounds like you should've rolled pve.
---
It's to slow down the drunk dwarves.
---
The people doing it probably don't think it's fun themselves. They get killed in half a second after spending minutes at a time finding good targets. But BiS for most classes are rank 13-14 pvp gear
---
If you've already summoned/killed him once, then you need to turn in the quest and collect the scroll to summon him again. The name of the scroll is Yeh'kinya's Scroll.
---
im sure he would be more upset of your inability to post a proper screenshot.
---
Most guilds wanted to wait until December 10th to see if things got better. So not really on the guilds.
---
99% are mages??? 99% are hunters in my server
---
This! The interaction itself bolsters the feeling of community. Also, wowhead can be a huge pain sometimes because it messes with the game / affects latency, so I’d much rather ask a question in chat that someone will be able to answer rather than lag out and feel isolated. I get that the tendency of elitist tryhards is to hyper focus on the grind and be the most informed thing in existence, but some (many) players just want to explore the game casually, make friends and learn from their fellow community members. You getting annoyed at people asking questions they could google sounds like a personal problem.
---
The abruptness of the ending is likely breaking my guild. We have been gathering votes on whether to move or not, but now have to make a decision on a night when we have a number of people not checking wow/discord. Sucks.

Obviously you already want to and I just here for validation. So do it. Join us.

Petition for blizz to make fishing give XP that way everyone can fish from 48-60 and we can finally get the World of Fishing that a bunch of us have wanted FOREVER. I want to see every body of water in the game surrounded by people fishing.

Where do you buy buzzard meat

I did this until one day, I saw an undead rogue fishing. I left him there as usually. Ran down the stream a ways to kill quest mobs. 2 minutes later he was eating my corpse. Since then, not even the fishers are safe from me.
---
Tribute and ony head is 2h
---
another thing is minmax pvp players will tend to pick races like undead or gnome. stands to reason players of these races will be more likely to engange in pvp with you. and the same applies when it comes to classes. an undead rogue is probably a lot more likely to gank you thrn say, a human paladin.
---
hAsHtAg NoChAnGeS
---
I'm very against people trying to make peace in a game built upon pvp and years of conflict.  Like "hey that alliance help me kill things.  Dont kill him" which makes me kill them.

However.  This fishing rule.  Is where I fully agree.  Let fishing bring us together.

Faction-only transfers was only enabled for a few realms.

So,  basically, your comment included, humans have no agency and make no decisions. Whelp, might as well get rid of all laws and justice systems everywhere on the planet. Not sure how you extrapolated any data about me from the fact I stated.
---
U/redridgeboss would like a word with you
---
shit devs are shit
---
There is definitely a correlation between preferred class and player personality.
---
Right. "Everyone knows what to do here?" is as often a threat as a misguided question; it's literally an assumptive statement with a question mark thrown at the end. Better to open with a generous but brief information share than to ask someone to step up to the chopping block, close their eyes, and wait to see if the axe falls.
---
Respecting a Fisher was the right thing to do, Turning your back on an undead rogue was not.
---
Band of accuria
---
I also have my horde alt on grob but my alliance main on thunderfury
---
Freezing band is a fc item usually. A lot of mages go for it because it does have practical use in duels though.
---
Another warrior trying to be a rogue. So many wannabe rogues. He probably has the devilasaur set also. He probably should have started a rogue.

Raid member that logs on fifteen minutes late... Summon possible? Lol no, enjoy your corpse runs. See you around Garr.
---
I think it depends on the situation. 
---
If its a guy asking for a SM carry and is level 35 and complaining about no help thats just silly. 
---
If its a core raiding member that can actively help the guild progress in raids then I feel if time permits they should do what they can to assist them. As someone else already pointed out the people who raid log are the most irritating as they don't contribute anything to the guild other than assisting in a kill one night a week.
---
What's with all the racist-leaning comments on Reddit?
---
Try the Black Dragonscale set the Shoulders, Boots, and legs give you 1% hit and 2% crit from the set bonuses plus the Fire Resist is super nice for MC.
---
Darnassus has become the new beacon of hope for this alliance player. There's no one ever there. That means there's no horde either. I can check the ah in peace. Maybe go afk. Who knows?! I don't be getting ganked while utilizing the auction house.
---
STALAGG ALLIANCE NEED YOU
---
2 manning is easy! If you're a resto shaman it's probably the easiest thing you can do to make money with a friend.
---
Free character moves closes tomorrow at 11am.  Anyone who intends to jump ship should take advantage now.
---
I took mining and engineering while leveling and have not a lot of money at level 36. Is there somewhere I could farm a bit for money?  I don't really mind not getting my mount at 40 but it will probably be closer to 50 at this rate.
---
STALAGG ALLIANCE NEEDS YOU.
---
There is a ton of hunters on my server!!! They just kill and loot and skin. It’s nice when they are alliance can get some free honor.
---
Warriors not wearing plate gear in places where they can get pvpd are idiots.
---
Also alliance come to Stalagg
---
No. The ganking/griefing was there in Phase 1 and it will only be slightly better than Phase 2 once Phase 3 drops.
---
No joke, I got preraid bis for my feral tank set really quickly, faster than my healing set, despite being main spec resto. It's like all of my RNG concentrated into my tanking set.
---
Wrong. 60s camp the boat because lots of other 60s take it and it's one of the best ways to farm honour as Horde.
---
Keep crying about it.
---
I guess he's talking about Devilsaur gear? Also Cadaverous Armor is an ok replacement for warriors if they can't get lucky with SGC.
---
Will never forget this guy. I rolled a NE hunter back around patch 1.20, was checking the AH through him when I noticed someone bought a rare blue I had put up there. I went to the mailbox and ran to the mount trainer and bought my first saber mount. 
---
Felt good man.
---
This is fine and all but then don't complain when other people get loot over you.
---
or play PvE

Im a troll hunter and i REALLY want this... idk how im gunna go about farming it though cause almost 0% chance everyone in group would pass if it dropped

I would say for any alliance to come to kirtonos but I’d prefer less competition so go somewhere else please thanks
---
Cuz, uh....THA’S why.
---
Agreed, but if your guild members offer absolutely no support, then why are they even guilded together? They  could just friend list each other and hang out in a private chat channel. Heaven forbid running a club in any hobby require any type of maintenance.
---
I've been scouring the internet looking for tips on how to arrange raid groups for shaman totems. Is there a detailed guide for general 40 man group arrangement? Is it better to spread out the hunters for trueshot, or give an extra melee windfury and stack the hunters for grace of air?
---
Same, started a Tauren Druid, haven't seen a single player. Also, moo.
---
I’m not arguing what best.
---
They might be timestamped, nobody knows. That aside, it really isn't worth it tbh. If you think about it, there will be tens of raids every day that DE most of everything and get Nexus Crystals. By the time P5 hits, you can run ZG 2 times a week, Ony 1-2 times a week, MC every week, BWL every week and a lot of that will be DE'd.
---
Windfury for melee  
---
Spread hunters
---
I've been playing about 40-50 hours a week and I've been finishing in bracket 10-11 which puts me around Rank 10.  It's actually that unbelievably hard to rank.
---
That’s my buddy! Was kicking it with him yesterday. He seems content with his solitude

I believe you need 340 for hardcap.

Turns out putting 3-4 times the population on a server wasnt a good idea.

Who would've guessed?

I help people when I want to help people, and I don't when I don't. At the same time, I don't give a single fuck how appreciative or reciprocative people are to my help because when I help people, I do so solely because I want to help people.
---
We expected blizzard to handle faction balance at least a little better, not way worse.
---
God I fucking feel this. Chose a warrior at launch hoping to get into a moderately paced progression guild, get to experience progression tanking -- life happened, couldn't apply to those sorts of guilds, all of whom made sure they were set pre-launch. Joined a short series of the sort of small casual guilds that dream big and slack bigger; finally sick of wiping Scholo runs, I joined an organized raiding guild so I can hope to see the inside of BWL...but as warrior dps. My guildmates old and new are happy to have me help them by tanking whatever dungeon they want to run, but now I need to be farming HoJ and Rend runs for myself? Anything I type in /guild or /whisper that isn't "yes, I'll happily tank for you" might as well be fucking invisible.
---
Yeah, everyone's chill now about how long it's gonna take to get to Dire Maul from Stormwind, but before anyone starts heading anywhere, or gets an invite, its "are you rolling on X?"
---
Oh great, thank you!
---
Fine with it as long as we get to choose where we go.
---
Thank you, I feel like thicc now. Keep going for them man!
---
Very true
---
How long will typical BWL bossfights be? I'm currently considering whether 5Mp 5 or 12 int are better. They even out at 3 minutes. If typical BWL fights are longer than that, it will be better to have the mp 5, if not the int will be better. 
---
Currently my guild takes 1-2 minutes per boss in MC.
---
Curious to know your loot addon too!
---
Grob is the worst server
---
Tarnaris lol
---
And that would be the problem.  I expect people to just not be assholes and have a good time.
---
I don’t care about loot and just want to have fun. The game isn’t fun for people like me when it’s filled with people who have your expectations and so people are leaving who played all through vanilla and would keep playing if the community as a whole didn’t decide this stuff mattered.
---
The downside to these lists are people who are angrily farming the same instance 60 times in a row and now getting upset when it’s not done in a fast enough time or with the totally optimized class layout or with perfect gear distribution or reserved items.  Or when they boot people from their groups for not paying attention to the lists.  It’s generally a lot more toxic to play classic than vanilla was and the competitive “win the game” community is why IMO.
---
What made me quit wow in the first place in wotlk was when ilevel became a thing people started to care about and eventually drove out any sort of social niceties that existed in favor of gear gates and pointless pissing contests.  Bis lists are just taking this concept into classic which is dumb because the content is so simple it’s not required.
---
It's used for DM tribute solo Hunter runs
---
There's also a trade goods vendor in the same area as bank and AH - which is reachable mounted (same with auctioneers).

Everyone can reach Rank10. I haven't even bothered with PvP because I have Vanilla Experience with 2 Rank 11s and one Rank13 and know its just a waste of my time.

Yes, but I'm not asking how he is doing more damage or what his rotation is. All I am asking is what are the optimal speeds for your MH and OF?

Nice, good guy. What is a "COD scam?" How did that happen?

Why the fuck is lesser populated factions allowed to transfer?

I bet I could give him a run for his money

I know bro. I make sure to only play ten minutes a day
---
They don’t bother me, but I don’t act like petulant pendant when understanding why others don’t appreciate their use.
---
In Ashenvale I came across a level 1 opposite faction player who started attacking me lol. They kept resurrecting and following me and spamming with emotes... wtf?! Is this a bot? So weird.
---
That's part of the game.  I've killed the escort NPC in Barrens when I see them doing the quest.
---
Just one more 2.5 hour run through wc should be all you need!
---
That free ten-slot bag sure is nice though.
---
The more I read here the more I realize just how unique my experience was. Here is me, some Shaman healer who never played Classic. I have never been to Maraudon, BRD, LBRS, etc.
---
In Maraudon I had a guildmate who knew the entirety of classic play guide for us. He explained how what works, etc. Same guildmate I managed to get to tour me through BRD full clear run. In LBRS I pugged and I first went to the wrong entrance. There was a mage who fittingly was in a guild named "Philantrophy" who explained everything to me. Every pull etc. Afterwards I brought this knowledge to the next people when I lead a run. 
---
What I did do however was to find out my gear and shit. This is because I love optimizing. I take the experiences unbiased and pure, but I will get the best stuff I can get. Hell I've somehow managed to be the healing leader in my guild without watching a single MC guide, having DBM nor having ever been to MC before.
---
People live life off of generalizations. Its how we operate on a daily basis.
---
Oh Pingu is the one that the horde like to ball-wash in discord.
---
Yeah, it's pretty obnoxious because the rewards for healers is pretty fucking BIS right now, so you know you are going to have some easy fucking targets (rshams, holy priests) if you camp that quest.  I ended up having to bring about 6 members of my guild to escort me on my priest and the rogue still fucking killed me once.
---
That'll show him
---
literally the first scene in troy lol
---
depends where you work kiddo
---
It is not unless you have nothing else in life that you can be proud of.
---
Now if it required any skill to achieve that goal then I'd agree and say that it's something that you can brag about but this guy just seems like he doesn't have anything going for him irl. 
---
Got a friend like that, wish i could help him but sadly you can't help people that don't want to be helped.
---
I enjoy playing my rogue, but warriors are better.
---
Yes I didn't work it quite correctly. I was trying to add on to /u/EmbarrassedDance9 's comment didn't mean it to sound like I didn't know they had unique guns.

this is what I am talking right here whoever you are thanks for proving what I am talking about. That its one sided trash tv where you take a social game and turn it into what a spectators amusement so you can laugh at some persons jokes, yuck.

At end of the day like I said before you taking the beauty of a social game especially classic here and making it a TV viewing event, Do not want and will try to discourage people on it.

Was trying to transfer my alliance toon off Grob so I could roll Horde. I can't find any directions on how to do this unless you're in a queue. Is that still the only way?

I'm an officer in my guild. I will help you with attunments and gankers, but that is about it. That said, my guild is 80-90% level 60 players.

I mean my brother has one in his book I don’t think I really needed it, I don’t even use eng yet lol but idk I asked on here because I wasn’t familiar w what made it so valuable
---
So basically it’s mostly valuable for hunters?
---
That has absolutely everything to do with it. A 20% horde advantage is exacerbated the more players are allowed online in a single server at a time.
---
Heartseeker isn't even "that bad" for horde. I just got into the low 50's and it's absolute misery questing in any 45+ zone. Gadgetzan is camped almost 24/7 by horde mages that kill then blink out of town. 
---
Alliance may outnumber horde by a large margin but horde are definitely more rough when it comes to the PvP camping. You attempt to rally anyone up to come defend FP's or boats and all you get is crickets. I think so many of the alliance refugees came here just to avoid PvP while staying on a PvP server.
---
The rule has always been: if it’s red it’s dead, unless that bitch is fishing. Then you post up next to em and whip out a pole.

Guilds really begin to bond over raiding.

If I recall the base price is 800 but you get fat discounts for being exalted. Which you need to buy it anyway.

So then saying "ud rogues are scummy humans in real life" is a reasonable thing to say? Cuz thats what im arguing against

Your own faction watched you solo 3 people for that chest then took it from you. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Good video btw. Love watching other SL locks

You are vividly demonstrating your part in this demographic.

I have no innate expectation that any WoW player knows how to breathe in a way that allows sufficient oxygen flow to their brains. But I do expect a player who doesn't know what they're doing to let me know with one simple sentence "It's my first time, anything I need to know?" before we get started. I'm happy to explain what we're doing so we don't have to waste time with unnecessary wipes and confusion.
---
Was right by him the whole way. It was over thanksgiving so no horde were out gridding it. Googled it after and apparently it’s a super common bug.
---
Wait, you trade retail gold for a wow classic token? Or did I not read that correctly, lol.
---
I can ask them. I doubt they would keep me out. I only saw 2 priests from in the guild at MC last night.

Looks like Alliance are going to dominate Earthshaker. If I were you I would look into Bloodflang. Someone upthread said it has a smaller population so maybe the same number of Horde with fewer Alliance to worry about. But don't wait.
---
That mage looks pretty chill.
---
A man of masturbation sophistication, I see.
---
problem is the "glass" cannons are not glass, but the melee are basically glass in a meta where casters do this much dmg
---
if a mage couldnt sit in iceblock for 20 seconds and blink 3 times around that, it wouldnt be as bad... but man is it broken right now
---
yea if i'm crafting anything i'm usually in TB. Only problem with that trade good vendor is she doesn't have the highest level items.
---
This is not a private server, there will be no reset. The realm is imploding and is a day or two away from being a PvE server and the thing above me is smug? It has to be an AI or 9 years old.
---
You're only allowed to transfer to Lower pop servers that they designate. They may open paid transfers to mega servers in time, but I wouldn't bank on it.
---
Yeah i thought about that too. Maybe ill try to put it in a future version.
---
Even if it was melee heavy I still don’t think freezing band is worth it. Maybe initially just 1 but there’s a lot of solid ring options including that AV exalted ring that has actual stats on it.

That's racist.

Oh thank you Thays exactly what I was looking for lol

Lol yea, eeek I go outside and shit XD
---
Isn't there one off the right by the weapons trainer??
---
Considering he wants epic riding, Id assume he's trading a token from him, for classic wow gold.
---
Your abilities are based on weapon damage, so a slow mainhand is good, but your offhand is just DPS and rage generation, so the highest DPS weapon with the fastest speed is best. Thats why you see warriors getting CHT as an offhand
---
They had us in the first half. Not gonna lie.
---
I run into one in winterspring on Kromcrush constantly. I just kill it’s pet and watch it die to mobs.
---
I live on the west coast and play on herod with no connectivity issues.
---
Try the real game, guys. BfA is there for all of you. Ever heard of the beautiful warmode option ?
---
Curious, what’s a dwarf with those weapons do on Magmadar / Golemag?
---
you cant just ask about weapon speeds that is just one small variable in a huge combination of factors for damage output
---
As a Horde player I wouldn’t mind Alliance having one more capital city. That’s probably an unpopular opinion though, so it’s good that they changed it I guess. Makes for an infuriating dungeon, that’s for sure.
---
such good timing
---
Is that site even correct though? It says that Zandalar Tribe is 71% horde and only 29% Alliance even though it has always been a slightly alliance favoured server (55/45)...
---
Oh yeah I need this
---
That’s my server! What’s the discord link? I’d be interested in joining to see the big happenings outside of my own gameplay.
---
I used to go there during MOP (last time I played) and hang out. It was really nice being in a completely empty city with just NPCs, though I felt so crippled without my flying mount.
---
Right now in MC, 1 person cant really wipe the raid (unless they really try, like using the bomb on ranged on barron)  
---
In BWL, 1 person being distracted or not knowing mechanics can wipe a raid, on almost every boss  
---
In AQ and Naxx that just gets more punishing  
---
In vanilla, there were guilds that never made it past Vaelstrasz, he just broke guilds, they would try for literally months and not get past him. Everyone thinks that this time they will easily clear BWL because "15 yr old content, no one back then knew anything, mythic is so much harder". I think that the number of guilds who make it through bwl will be higher than before, but its still gonna break a good amount of guilds, especially because people dont have the patience for progression raiding, wiping for multiple hours until the raid is too tilted to keep going.  
---
Im collecting guild discords for my server so I can listen in on the carnage, its gonna be entertaining.
---
Go on....
---
He saved you durability cost.  He was being a helper.  Now he could have actually assisted you and killed the mobs but he couldn't get the loot if he did that.
---
Well, for Warrior at least, the gains aren't so marginal, but I agree. It's not worth most people's time.
---
Nice try Heartseeker spy, trying to get more horde onto the server to honor farm, i c u.
---
Imagine being this butthurt over an online computer game.
---
wow man, you really suck. smfh
---
Horde dominant populations across most servers. The alliance BGs will be insta pop while you'll probably see 20-30 min que times during peak hours.
---
Looks like shadowed unit frames. No clue why it's showing you the "testing" state. It usually only looks like this if you're in the middle of moving the windows around.
---
It's a pretty simple UI. You sure you downloaded the correct patch files?
---
You go vendor it quickly, 
---
Come back and loot this item. 
---
Then you mail it to an alt and buy back your original item.
---
It looks like you still have the test box checked. I think that's what it's called. It puts every frame available up so you can see them and move them around. If you uncheck it they go away and only display when needed (party when in a party, raid when in a raid)
---
It was just a joke lol. Like the post.
---
Cleanest seat on the bus
---
Flamelash was a relatively hi pop server.
---
But on ganking servers, it's most about the dynamics of faction balance.
---
I feel like that was that scene from Troy..two of the best warriors going at it to decide the fate of Helen...i.e. an ice dragon
---
I exhaled quite noisily at this. Thank you for your wordsmithing kind stranger. My day is yet a tiny bit brighter because of you and this sub.
---
If you ONLY PvE, sure.
---
low DPS only made the fight more difficult to coordinate, you still need non-wall-licking DPS who can use burning adrenaline appropriately as well as tanks that can rotate and maintain threat (and dps who watch their own threat)  
---
Right now, people cant stop DPSing onyxia for 30 seconds while P3 gets sorted out, so I doubt they can handle BWL with all its threat mechanic fuckery. People are gonna get the buff, pop all their cooldowns, insta pull the boss and wipe the raid, and wonder why the tank couldnt hold threat.
---
You're worth just as much honor as anyone else. Don't know why you think you're exempt to that.

As you can see, these are 2 of the most popular servers on classic, and they haven't spiked past 6k since layering was removed.

I guess you hate going to comedy shows as well?
---
is his name Whines on Windseeker server?
---
Pugs wipe on ony now, but other pugs one shot everything in mc, so some can pug, others can't
---
I'm almost certain that's against classic wow terms and services.
---
The time spent to rewards obtained ratio for honor grinding in vanilla/classic is absurd.  So much work for so little.
---
8pc T1 makes you full tank heal. 3pc T2 makes you glorious raid healer. 
---
Those are the only real healer roles anyway so being able to do them both very well makes you the most diverse almost by default.
---
That's what they means. They were saying it won't be replaced in P5 so op won't be wearing entire plate.
---
Save for your epic AV mount, run dungeons for gear.  
---
The amount of dps you gain from anything you buy is so small its just not worth it.
---
This is a very good service you have done the community IMO.  The honor system is trash and the vast vast majority of players get close to zero out of it.
---
Thank you for making everyone aware of your almost certainty.
---
DM Tribute
---
They actually only get better even up to Naxx. Resto druids are fantastic and bosses like Patchwerk are often tanked by feral druids.
---
It's a bit foolish to assume &lt;x&gt; is happening, so &lt;y&gt; won't happen.  There's always exceptions.  Dickheads fish too.
---
Haha
---
lol what kinda slurs did you use?
---
It’s because said 5 mans don’t have any loot we want. Why would we go out of our way to tank what gives us nothing whilst everyone else (a) gets drops to roll on which I’ll pass on and; (b) gets an equal chance at everything that can drop to vendor for gold.
---
I tanked strat UD until I got Baron’s Cape
---
UBRS until I got truestrike, painweaver and the belt
---
I tanked BRD extended arena runs until I got SCG and HoJ
---
But strat live, full BRD runs and scholo are trash for warriors (strat UD for tanks too). So why would we do it unless we get something we could roll on that you don’t need (the first orb or random greens or blues that you would vendor). Hell the only other way warriors make gold is by mining which for some reason everyone else does too even though the only classes that need the crystals are us, HoR builders and T,BBotW builders. So if you aren’t willing to forgo 3-5g ea in vendor trash or your 20% chance at first orb (whilst still getting pre-BiS), why would I forgo my time to gear you up?
---
I’ll tank for guildies though. Those guys will pay me back with their time later.
---
Of course they're going to transfer, they can't even play the game at this point. What do you want them to do, keep on getting ducked with no complaints?
---
I see an Orc hunter under the canvas to the right of the red banner!
---
happened to someone on my server/guild around the same time
---
Then....1/2grats?   Whatcha looking for here?
---
Mages on populated servers, how are you faring when your class is often overpopulated? They seem tempting to roll but I wouldn't want to look forward to barely getting any gear at 60 due to how many mages I'd be competing with, especially since I don't have as much time to raid constantly.
---
I'd get rank 3, and buy the av mount for 640g.
---
Never said it was an oc, enjoy the smiles it brings
---
I mean Blizzard has 2 choices. Take my money and keep my sub by allowing pvp to pve transfer OR lose both.
---
This is the case for a significant amount of players.
---
The danger in this is that assumed behavior and there's no way to enforce it.  That leads to people exploiting others' expectations.
---
"I'm going to fish, they'll turn their back and I kill them."  Bait &amp; switch.
---
The only way you can expect to choose to be left alone is by rolling on a PvE server where PvP is voluntary by the minute.
---
Holy crap that's epic :)
---
You should have rolled on a pve serveur
---
Tauren rogues? Sounds like a retail man
---
AFAIK Horde players on ZT are transferring to Dragonfang. ZT is indeed Alliance-favored.
---
I wore Eye of Rend until I got my Warlord helm in back in vanilla.
---
Wtf is this comment I obviously asked for pvp and not for aoe farming
---
I would actually wear that as a bathrobe.
---

Jesus you’re dense
---
Hey! Yeah, that I know of, but I don't want an addon that changes my whole setup/UI "/
---
Not against any rules that exist currently. Been doing it and clearly/openly advertising on my realms forums for the past month.
---
Your complaint is literally why resilience was added in TBC, it allows people to be able to counterplay, its also probably why so many people advocate for TBC classic.  
---
Anyway, the thing here is youre comparing a.. regular weapon swing crit? to a frostbolt cast when its more in line with fireblast. Lightning bolt+shock also are 2 casts (yes 1 is instant, but still 2 casts), so yeah both of them doing 4k is pretty reasonable. How much does a warrior with BRE hit for if they crit twice? Its going to be the same damage, like regular weapon crit + MS crit will absolutely devastate a ton of players.  
---
If youre crying about balance, yeah you got some footing there, but only in *that* specific matchup. Warrior vs mage is one of, if not the most 1 sided matchups in the game. But while warrior sucks against mage, tthey slap the shit out of rogues unless the rogue is extremely skilled and lucky. So its a rock paper scissors thing and thats just the game.  
---
For now though, use fap and go engineering to equal out the playing field, if not, then idk deal with it or play another game. Nobody should be surprised here and **definitely** shouldnt be asking for balance changes.
---
Hurrr durrr, muh honor.
---
Keep an eye on Flamelash EU; all the alliance guilds have now transferred off. The horde now just stand around in IF because there literally aren’t enough alliance players to push them out. This is exactly the situation you’re describing
---
Gotta assert dominance
---
Why would it be my win strategy wtf
---
It should be big bane vs a little babe lol.
---
This is awesome! Thank you so much!
---
Man I wish you were on my server, I would never have to pay for wow again. I make 125g in less than a day lol.
---
The other consequence of their connected BG decision means these server imbalances no longer matter. After BGs release, the only time a low alliance population will matter is opening the AQ gates, but even then they could likely funnel mats via the neutral AH.
---
Hmm yeah  a wsg mage is often 2nd flagcarry
---
I've thought of several responses to this and all I've done is disturb myself.
---
In total classic fashion had the grunge rock music and seemed to edit so it was more of a highlight reel than a "PvP" video. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed it. It seemed really authentic to the vanilla PvP video style.
---
guy in my guild got a 1 week ban for doing exactly what this guy is trying to do.
---
Plot twist: he sent it to himself
---
The math on this is also incorrect though. You only need a minimum of 1 week of bracket 14 at the end to hit rank 14. Getting 12k a week from bracket 13 for 6 weeks on rank 13 will be enough prior to pushing a bracket 14 for HWL/GM. It just extends the grind out.
---
Yup i used that method, super easy
---
Horde?, Lol, alliance.
---
Would this fix the sheer amount of players running around at the same time? Even with a 55 45 server it still is really terrible
---
Saw one on my server recently that was out of ammo, so his pet died, and then he just kept going around, standing a good distance from a mob, hunter's mark it, stare at it for 30 seconds, repeat
---
Welcome to playing on a PvE server that the tryhards kept telling people to transfer to when they didn't were vocal about being steamrolled 10v1.
---
Fast travel
---
The speed of a weapon literally has no bearing on crit damage, or any other damage. The only reason people say "slower is better" is because slower weapons tend to have higher top end damage ranges. Are you going to choose the bow doing 100-150 damage with a weapon speed of 1.5 or the bow doing 90-140 damage with a weapon speed of 3.0? 
---
Higher damage ranges result in high per damage numbers, it's as simple as that.
---
Yes
---
Now mace wearing alliance everywhere screamed with glee.
---
When I was leveling my alt me and my friend ran into quite a few horde hunter bots all in shimmering flats. The way we bugged them out as alliance (this was pre honor system mind you) is we would kill their pet after they started a pull, interrupt rez pet and kill the mob. They would then stand in one place spamming call pet over and over again. I'm sure the bot tech has advanced past that, but was entertaining at the time
---
Isn't this the bar that the npc's start dancing on tables around midnight or something like that?
---
Nah I don’t, I just tab I’m groups of mobs and click on mobs then cast if tabbing isn’t the most convenient. I could see them being beneficial if you were doing serious PvP
---
good story, not like "today i finally skinned my 150th devilsaur, i know it is not big but it is a big achievement for me" :)
---
He's not that lonely, I harass him with my alt into which I log in to reset instances. Every reset we get one sweet minute before I'm given party lead, reset and relog to my main.
---
1. Meet me in retail on the server I used to play on. (create a char)
---
2. Fly to the nearest AH to confirm current token cost
---
3. I trade you the gold for you to buy a token
---
4. Relog to Classic and meet to trade classic gold
---
It's pretty straight forward and I'm effectively taking all the risk as I am trading first. So far no one has scammed me \*fingers crossed\* but I'm generally trusting and want to believe in people.
---
Lucky is an understatement for SGC. I lived in BRD 52-60 and have never once seen the dervish
---
The math is based on finishing at the 75th percentile of each bracket. Of course there's some wiggle room in reality where you might be Bracket 12 or 13 for a while and only push 14 the last week or two. The brackets are determined discreetly (by # of spots open and w.r.t. how much honor the leader of each bracket has), but the points awarded are continuous. Finishing last in Bracket 14 should not award much more points than finishing first in Bracket 13 (depends on the difference in honor between those players).
---
What you're referring to is an extreme example where someone is always at the top of Bracket 13 without touching Bracket 14 :
---
It's obvious that the breaking point is at 12000 - 20% 59999.99 = 0. Starting at 55000 and gaining 12000 a week with a 20% decay, he will converge to 60000 over an infinite amount of weeks. Depending on how Blizzard rounds values, it might even be technically possible to get Rank 14 without ever being in Bracket 14.
---
55,000 \\\\ 56,000 \\\\ 56,800 \\\\ 57,440 \\\\ 57,952 \\\\ 58,362 \\\\ 58,689 \\\\ 58,951 \\\\ 59,161 \\\\ 59,329 \\\\ 59,463 \\\\ 59,571 \\\\ 59,656 \\\\ 59,725 \\\\ 59,780 \\\\ 59,824 \\\\ 59,859 \\\\ 59,887 \\\\ 59,910 \\\\ 59,928 \\\\ ... \*20 weeks later\* \\\\ 60,000
---
hurrrrrr durrr uhhhh pvp lul u kno wha u were gettin into hurt durr
---
That's an assumption. I usually only play for a few hours every week, but when I broke my ribs and couldn't work   I ended up playing 8 hours a day for a while. Doesn't mean I didn't have a life, I just had a forced vacation from work and spent half of the day playing wow lol
---
&gt; They take away from the true glory of the game... no matter *how* you argue it. The true core of the game is to:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Level  
---
&gt;Play with friends and the community  
---
&gt;Get gear that you like, whether it be the stats and/or aesthetics of their looks (within reason)
---
Sorry to say that, but a lot of people (especially in "progress"-guilds) play for the pure competition, for example logs. Logs are usually better if the mob dies faster --&gt; BIS requirement.
---
Imagine rolling on a PVP server just to PVE.
---
Heartseeker is the promised land for horde PVPers.
---
Isn't it mainhand only?
---
surprised mods didn’t remove this 😂
---
I guess you didn't know that bgs will be cross realm?
---
He was feared until he was out of range, wouldn't have mattered.
---
I expected hentai.
---
That must be sad ye, what's even more sad is deciding to do a dire maul run with friends, and getting killed all over feralas by 60 hordes as a 5 man group, being mind controlled back so that we can't run away. Flamelash Wpvp was anything but fun, with a few exceptions.
---
Because going fast and preparing for that is fun. If it isn't to you, either communicate that to your guild or, if you're fairly new there and don't have any big attachments to the guild, maybe search for another one.
---
I for one am fine with getting world buffs.
---
If this works you have done a disservice to warriors everywhere haha
---
You can sharpen axes. You can’t sharpen maces.
---
Man up then. Delete your horde characters and roll an Ally character. Be the change you want to see.
---
every race has its own riding skill for its specific mount
---
on the horde side tauren have codo riding, undead have horse riding, orks have worgen riding and trolls have raptor riding
---
when you get exalted with one of the faction i mentiond you can buy there riding skill
---
&gt;You've had weeks to move.
---
Actually, we haven't. The server was healthily populated on both sides until Alliance decided to panic and flee. It was less than 12 hours ago we found out that a significant portion of Alliance guilds are leaving the server. 36 hours is not enough time to organize a large guild transfer(Assuming we would even want to leave :D)
---
\&gt; Now you're playing on a virtual PvE server though, things are not looking as good eh? 
---
Considering world PvP becomes irrelevant in less than a week, I don't mind. More resources for us Horde and less salty Alliance corpse camping one person with 5 people :D
---
Incoming negative comments: enjoy it man, it feels fucking good!
---
seriously
---
There was a fantastic post few weeks back about a horde warrior ganking in Raven Hill Cemetary in Duskwood. He put self imposed rules on himself that he could only use walk (not default run), and could not charge at them. So he slowly walked at lowbie alliance, and if they didn't/couldn't get away he would demolish them when he got in melee range.  
---
At one point people figured out his little game, and kited him around (self imposing kiting), and got like 5-6 people to group up, and counter jump him, and take him down. Good stuff :)
---
Horde always has the best players.
---
What is your proff?
---
Monster flag carrier with it doesn’t matter what class. It’s not needed but you won’t not benefit from having it
---
I’ve always been a fan of “everyone or no one” finally an admin I can get behind
---
I can personally vouch for the rogue abilities, but I've heard from multiple people that they've noticed it on polymorph, and 2 mages say they noticed it on both frost nova and frostbite.
---
If you as you stated in the comments didn't do anything else terrible are you sure that the gm was a actual gm
---
smolderweb is closer to 65H:35A
---
They're the best class in the game for PvE and can heal fine as an Elemental/Resto hybrid build. The only problem is they're exclusive to the faction with no plumbing.
---
Do you dismiss your pet before logging? That prolly takes it off
---
Mages are fucking eaten by druids 1v1
---
There was a guy called Kuroma on my server Daggerspine in vanilla, I think he held the R14 title for a good 6 months? Might do some research to refresh the memory lol.
---
I think you're missing the joke. OP is joking that feral tanks can make it in time to raids, due to stealth, because they can stealth past the other faction ganking the raid entrance, while warrior tanks get stuck and corpse-camped.
---
Is there a priest t2 version?
---
Great now for a month cc will be useless blizz won't fix it that fast but I'll have to test to see if this works.
---
Wow classic population
---
Cool I'll PM you on my level one that's totally my bank alt.
---
If innate behaviour of players causes large issues a design flaw is usually at fault.
---
Hey. Just hit 60 with my druid. Been leveling as a feral/resto build - heart of the wild 1/29/21. 
---
I love feral, but I know that in classic it's a bit meme spec - at least at this point, when not all content and gear is available. My question is - what do I respect to? I want to be able to pvp and pve heal.
---
Also which content is available for me without bis items(got like 2-3 so far)? I got like +140 healing, 5k+ mana. Did couple of strat runs and it was fine.
---
As a horde troll, I agree with you.
---
Heard about some guy who did that. Has like 500k HK and still plays retail.
---
Punished because you didn't use the Zerker rage. Fun stuff!
---
So... what the hell did you do!! That was nuts.
---
It's not intelligent enough to be an AI or a 9 year old.

It’s not the damage though, it’s the timing his enrages. I would melee him for a few hits, then WC and get range before he enraged.
---
It only works if the person issuing the cc emotes towards the affected target.
---
So I now just realized that ur asking the alliance 
---
sry.

 I play horde
---
Sweeping Strikes, stance to bezerker, death wish, whirlwind.
---
The struggle when you don't have time to summon a pet.
---
assuming you're human/orc with the appropriate weps, you can easily get the 6% hit you need from any of the following:
---
Mask of the Unforgiven (2%), 
---
Ony tooth neck,

Truestrike shoulders or Wyrmhide Spaulders (both 2%), 
---
Battleborn bracers,

Brigam girdle,

Why do you assume it has to do with revenge? It’s just honor 🤷🏻‍♂️

---
Lol anyone whothinks theyll stick around is having a fever dream
---
Poor bloke got sent to the Tiksi branch.
---
Thats racist
---
No death wish.
---
I always find it funny when people saying "Horde has better pvp racials".
---
What does this "pvp" mean here? 1v1 duel, larege scale wpvp or battleground?
---
I mean, in battleground, Alliance has its unique advantages like Paladin classs, double stealth for guarding flag as NE hunter, Perception against enemy rogues arround the flags/towers or any BG target, Stoneform against poisons and bleed. The game design is asymmetry but I don't quite see Horde racials are any overpowering (like a lot people blindly believe) in battleground especially premade vs premade.
---
And in 1v1, the vanillia(classic) wow is far away from balance in 1v1, like Forsaken Will is good against priest and lock ,but as a Dwarf rogue it's super easy for me against an undead rogue. People back in vanilla times didn't really play the game too good. A lot noob player didn't even know what they can do with their abliities. And there were a lot undead pvp videos back then making people believe "if you pvp you need to roll the Horde".
---
And as for world pvp, the only matter is how many people you can call for help. It's literally PPPPPPPvP, not a real PvP. So people will compromise and join the winning side ,more and more Horde coming up. And they say "I want to PvP, I wan't beter racials".
---
I played Horde in vanilla, and leveled both on Horde and Alliance in classic now. And considering the queue time for the incoming BG I haven't log my Horde character for weeks.
---
Wish you were on horde :/
---
I got stuck there too but luckily had a warlock pass by who I dueled and he feared me free haha
---
Imagine a server with 0 alliance raiding guilds though.
---
PvP is designed to be balanced, its just balanced around a game mode (BGs) where getting globaled doesn't matter or determine the winner. You global them, they global you, so what? Games still go to an hour. The main pvp feature in this game isn't even out yet.
---
Yeah I figured that out immediately after posting mb!
---
It shouldnt take it off unless you dismiss it. In that regard, the pet should be seen as an entirely new entity when recalled with the same HP. Bit hunters are still littered with bugs. E.g. dismissing a pet with aggro will make it retain the aggro when recalled. It shouldnt have aggro as a new entity
---
Tried both, and they still are gone. I think the problem is actually that the buff timer is still ticking even when you are offline. Because when I log in and check right after, it's still there. But if I check the day after or couple of hours, the buff is gone on the pet but not the player.
---
Exactly. Then throw back a couple of 700hp autos
---
iF iT's ReD iT's DeAd
---
I know I already have, I am saying I might transfer to avoid it.
---
I agree with the no killing fisherman but, I do enjoy sapping them and leaving them wondering lol
---
Outside of any Horde-favored instance like WC/RFK/RFD/etc.
---
When people phase out, they sit there defenseless during their loading times.
---
This doesn't matter to people with real high end computers \*much\*, but it's 3-5 seconds still when the server isn't exactly responding the best.
---
Server load tends to up the minimum loading screen timer from a theoretical minimum of 1 to like 90 frames or 1-3 seconds depending on client framerate.
---
r/Instagramreality
---
You have your answer already, I think. Whether you want to accept it is up to you.
---
Is it though? R13 gear and R14 weapons will last you to late AQ40/Early Naxx.
---
Having the same problem leveling my alt. Haven’t tried stacking him.
---
Lmao
---
1 month comment lol. Anyway if you read again it never said only live. Obviously orbs in live but we ran whole strat, live and ud. Tank changed loot at Baron. At the very end of our journey.
---
Very unlikely as those changes are purely client side, but who knows. Maybe someone else with more knowledge can comment on this.
---
Blasted Lands are pretty good for 1v1s although it’s less honor efficient as it’s less populated than your searing gorges and feralas
---
Oh no! It's only a year left until AQ &amp; the war effort! We're running out of time!!!
---
(Same will can be said about you guys when you go and ruin Earthshaker.)
---
Depending on your class at around 40 you can farm the welps in Badlands for Small Flame Sacs. On my server they sell for 80s -1g/per or 4-5g a stack. The welps are 41-43 and have a ranged attack so it’s a little better for melee classes with an interrupt or two.
---
I mean it's a 2g profit.
---
ty for reporting the bug, will patch it asap
---
Rogues ruin fucking EVERYTHING. That didn't even require any skill, like anything the rogue does.
---
Not cool.
---
You bring up a really good point here.  I tried retail WoW and it really isn't my thing.  Classis was a good chance to get back into a game I loved, and I was very much looking forward to progressing not only through Vanilla, but a lot of the other earlier expansions as well.  Seemed classis was hugely successful so it seemed like a no-brainer that Blizzard would keep that train rolling.
---
But the absolute disgusting mess the game is currently kind of calls their ability or willingness to care about classic into question.
---
Undead are more aggro towards me, but that might be because I’m playing a warlock. 
---
Trolls are pve players through and through
---
How many bank alts would it take? 500? Like bees they swarm the 60 and cause his computer to crash
---
I thought your name would have been too much of a coincidence otherwise :) 
---
Oh man, I guess tanking should be quite a bit smoother now with the new ranks - good that you found the solution, I bet you're not the first to do that!
---
Maybe you were out of range of pally/totem fire resist at points
---
Our feral tank is always tanking both Raggy and Onxia. The increase in threat generated by a feral compared to a warrior i superior unless there is a mechanic insta gibbing the tank. Feral puts a bigger pressure on the healers due to a not having CDs, for sure, but that shouldn't be a problem.
---
You are the chosen one
---
103 xD but i also AOE stupid allience nubs at menthil harbor lol THEY SUCKS!!
---
No changes, definitely not changes to fix the issues we introduced by making changes.
---
People need to stop acting like this is a faithful recreation of the vanilla experience.
---
Did you send that to yourself or are you a girl? I'd mock my friends with things like that... losing 80 gold is a very cheap way to learn something
---
I think he meant blasted lands, the body parts for the consumables quests there.
---
I tend to leave those brave enough to attack me alone.
---
Then again, i never gank to begin with, but If someone much lower lvl than me is brave enough to try, i usually end up trying to help them with whatever they’re doing instead.
---
His eyes even light up when you took a picture!
---
A warrior in my guild lost it to a warlock a couple of weeks ago..
---
My favorite part is people are still crying about blizzard not banning scammers while those same people refuse to name and shame. you're forgetting that your server is your world. Isolated from every other server. Once news gets out X person is a scammer, he'll have no choice but to stop coz he wont get any business.
---
My friends convinced me not to roll pvp. Thanks for reaffirming that decision.
---
There's no forge in darnassus
---
Horde has it now
---
Nobodies tryna wipe their ass before they shit though.
---
I don't understand what the problem is.
---
Don't play on a PVP server if you can't stand the thought of dying by other players.
---
I seriously doubt lifestone scales with spellpower. If it did, it would be fixed instantly. Here I am talking about the regen of course, as the on use effect (which might scale) has a 30min cd making it unreliable.
---
Pretty sure you also picked the wrong class for this. Paladin seems like a better bet.
---
Who's watching the fucking hash?!
---
You think they wont, but they will
---
Yeah he jebaited is there every single time I log on. Pingu is only there sometimes. There’s a couple rogues too.
---
Good luck. This is so hard to get that back in TBC people would start a character on a low pop server, grind this out, then pay to transfer the character to their main server.
---
It takes a seriously dedicated twink to get the trinket, and Nat’s hat and boots.
---
No changes is fine.  But using that as an excuse to deal with or even acknowledge issues caused by the drastic changes that were made is where the problem comes in.
---
30k people on a realm with 1.12 class updates against an unchanged molten core.  That's not a nochanges meme, that is laziness.
---
Parry
---
The problem is that min-maxing is usually done by top tier players and now the masses are trying to emulate that. There are now a ton for dog shit warriors wearing leather that still don't know their class.

For you

You don't actually get DHKs for killing the summomable npcs.

watch lvl 1s raid beating lvl 60s in searing gorge
---
Lolol that’s so great!
---
Recently I was running into black rock mountain and I saw 1 night elf male running towards me and nobody else, so I thought "great! Alliance controls BRM for once!"....then, as if out of a movie, I see about 60 horde come around the corner chasing this 1 night elf that is running straight towards me, fml....Of course, we both died. But I laughed so hard for a few minutes, totally worth it.

Thunderfury?

Bought the cookbook myself, haven't made anything yet. I just like having it :)
---
I think +15 agi enchant comes with phase3 if im not misinformed.
---
Ahhh the Classic Experience™. 
---
Literally people ahve been saying for months that this would happen. It was said even before Classic was released. Why? Because it's exactly what played out before, and people haven't changed. 
---
All you sociopathic children that get off on completely ruining other people's playtime and try to hide behind "Herpa derpa PvP on a PvP server" when you and 234 other high levels camp some level 15 just trying to quest are now going to enjoy the fruits of your labor. 
---
A completely dead server with no defenseless targets for you to terrorize. 
---
You never enjoyed world PvP. World PvP is glorious and an epic fight, a continuous struggle for supremacy in a zone where the battle rages and ebbs and flows, each side gaining advantage temporarily before the other side rallies and pushes back. Not corpse camping lowbies. 
---
You deserve your dead servers.
---
Yeah it sucks that dps warriors are needing on all the dps leather gear, but that's a flaw in the game design, can't hate other players for trying to max their dps imo, even tho it sucks as a rogue.
---
no, PVP and PVE are two completely opposite things. Farming rams or rushing bosses is both PVE, therefore not completely opposite. They behave exactly like any other mob out there. You can even taunt them and prot warrior tank them.
---
bro
---
Story goes that earthshaker was balanced before all the transfers. Then a massive influx of horde came (my guild included) and alliance started whining. Apparently we have gotten a big influx of alliance now as well. Maybe it will balance it out...but still... OUT OF MY SWAMP!
---
The actual world PvP isn't because of the huge servers, but the absolutely ridiculous grind for R14 is the same as always.  No one got r14 in vanilla without playing less than 100 hours a week for the last few weeks at least.
---
Only for melee classes.  For anyone else R14 is not worth it.  Like for example hunters: the weapon is only slightly better than Rhok'delar and just straight up worse than Ashjre'thul.  Not worth no-lifing wow for a month+.
---
Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
---
I always see warriors pop up after "got tank, lf dps"
---
Theres a few warriors.  They just ain't tanking.
---
You #nochanges folk are dumb as a fucking rock. There’s already been a dozen changes. Why keep the game in a hindered state? We Soros be asking for changes to fix the game.
---
Man shut up. You have seen others complain about this on Reddit and just blindly whine about shit you should not care about.
---
If you're in a contested zone or are flagged for pvp, yes. If you're in a zone that's controlled by your faction and aren't flagged for pvp then no. 
---
You can get flagged for pvp in a couple ways, but most commonly it's from attacking other players. So this gnome had been messing around and went back to a safe zone, but the pvp flag hadn't expired so he was fair game. The other people around him were safe.
---
#nochanges
---
To be fair, in classic BGs the twink brackets will be mostly full of twinks. There won’t be many actual level 17s queuing for WSG. It’ll be mostly twinks playing against other twinks.
---
I always found it fun in a stats sort of way. I’d play and say okay this game I’m going to try to go 20-0 or get 40k damage or whatever. But whenever you’d queue in the low brackets I’d almost always find one geared out opposing member on the enemy team that was fun facing
---
Not quite. A ton of horde guilds moved in earlier completely stomping alliance. They have been whining on discord for a while about it. Maybe it will balance out now ;)
---
They're opposite when it comes to winning the map or gaining honor. You get basically nothing but XP from farming mobs.
---
he's not alone, there is  [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=15678](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=15678)  next to him :)
---
It's just the huge server population that makes the issue that much more prevalent.
---
I rolled a human priest,  is it realy that big of a deal?
---
And no arena achievements above 1750.  Just goes to show that holding R14 doesn't mean you are actually good, just that you can play the most.
---
They sure are milking it with all these free xfers huh
---
As a warlock, I wondered what were his 3 voidwalker macros.
---
Oh hey, been seeing you guys around since the first weeks past launch. To be honest when I saw the guild tag for the first time on a level 12 at the crossroads, I figured it was one of those guilds with a funny name that lives and dies in the barrens lol.
---
Looking at lionheart helm
---
That's pretty cool. So on this realm, Horde won the war.
---
Heartseeker
---
I am one of 8 mages in our raid. The thing about mages at this phase is that yes they are overpopulated but tier sets are generally garbage for mages and there are only like, 3 or 4 items from MC+Ony that are actually big upgrades for raiding. With BWL and AQ that will change, however. At which point I might switch classes if the competition gets too bad, but at this point it's still fine.
---
Hello fellow hunter ❤️
---
At 56 if you haven’t done it yet there are some quests in Azshara. Elite quests in Searing Gorge (off the main path enough), and the searing gorge key chain is great xp. Feralas and Winterspring have a crack when it’s the most common raid night, else in a week when BGs come out. 
---
Hero of the horde questline in Blasted Lands, do Searing Gorge. 
---
Of course plague lands but I suggest waiting a week for that as the GY is so terrible. 
---
Don’t forget your cloth rep turn ins for xp.
---
Apparently he’s hated by horde players too. Ally seem to like him or maybe it’s just me. It just wouldn’t be Ironforge without him.
---
Update: I've got the chest!  
---
The hardest part is obv. getting the carpace from UBRS but i got it randomly so there is that.  
---
Second hard part was getting the stichings from Stratholme - on avrage i got 2 each run of the UD side, once i didnt get any.  
---
Blood of the heroes was super annoying at times as the P2 is out and ganksquads roaming all around... but somehow i managed.  
---
The scales i bought off AH for 10-15s each so it was the easiest  
---
Thanks for all your feedback guys! The quest was a lot of fun and ive met some nice people while doing it :D. I totally recommend doing the quest just for the journey itself :)
---
Yeah and i'm heavily considering just leveling another toon somewhere else outside of raiding because i'm not someone who likes to spam dungeons over and over i'm much more of a questing person which I can't do. I tried doing just two quests in searing gorge and it was multiple hours of deaths. 51 to 52 took me played time of 1 day and like 15 hours because i refused to dungeon spam. I've kept up all my characters all the way to 110 multiple to 120 but retail is total trash so I didn't bother finishing them all. I'm at 4 hours in now and 3 bars in to 54 but i'm just going to give up and get this toon to 60 dungeoning.
---
At glad level and above the only way you'll hit mana burns is if you cc the druid or create enough pressure to force mistakes. Hitting a fear into mana burn may be possible at some points, but that setup just isn't winning the mana game.
---
If you're fishing my pools, we fightin' over the fishes
---
Probably because the bots beat you to it.
---
Reminds me of Path of Exile where I would link "\[Shabby Jerkin\] all over my chest slot." in chat.
---
Will of the forsaken is one of the best pvp racials in the game. It's so good.
---
Sad
---
Okay i'll give blizzard a little bit of the blame. But if you combined every single pvp server into one I guarantee you horde would still have 3 times the numbers or more. How about removing racial abilities completely when they decide to do BC so this mess doesn't happen again as that seems to be the excuse that all the horde are giving.
---
Doesn’t it make it more fun? (like Dark Souls)
---
Other games don’t even have factions, and instead of five there’s groups of 10 to 15 wandering around and ganging you
---
Context and details matter in this situation. If he asks for help and never gets it, its not really unfair to say that to him, the guild is unhelpful and he is considering another guild. If he's not getting what he wants out of the guild, its totally reasonable for him to voice his concerns.
---
people also tend to roll horde for the pvp advantage while alliance are more PvE oriented. I predict what the other guy said; +20 min queues for horde.
---
I think the simplest way would have a fresh seasonal server that you can then roll over the toon to another server (like your regular server)
---
I think there's a large amount of people doing wPvP now because it's the only way to get honor and that a lot of them may not bother leaving Ogrimmar while queue'd for BGs.
---
I'm sure there'll be many that wPvP while queued but I think most players wont.
---
Only used to download chrome?
---
Ok boomer
---
Not at all. You get bonus spirit and your raid only needs 2-4 fear ward.
---
Yeah, alliance moving from 38-62 server to 75-25 one making both of them worse.
---
Woyer
---
Look into what farming manual crowd pummelers means before considering feral.
---
make a new pve char like i did. they should never open transfers for alliance again.
---
0,23%
---
I have killed so many bots that I get automated whispers from their Overlord. It’s always the same classic, “I FUCK YOUR MOM.” insult. I don’t even report the bots anymore because it’s an extra 5k-10k honor a week. My bot stomping grounds are deadwind pass and blue dragons in Azshara. Happy hunting!
---
It is reversed and most likely will be worse than flamelash. I predict at least 75-25 alliance favored
---
Had a guy just like this in my guild he ended up getting kicked.
---
 This was a while ago and I'd just dinged 60 on my warrior. I'd always check guild tab before doing any dungeons to see if anyone avaliable, especially since I'm a tank. On this particular day I logged on saw 4 level 60s in guild online, all of them already in BRD so i found a group on my own. 15 mins later this druid asshole (one of the guys who was in BRD when I logged) starts /w me complaining that I didnt advertise in /g chat that I was looking for group and that I was selfish for finding a group on my own, despite the fact that he was already in one when I logged. He said I should have waited until they had finished before I started. 
---
I guess I'm a massive selfish asshole XD
---
We have made the kale chips and these so far. Both were very good. Going to make so much more over the coming weeks!
---
Heartseeker. It's 80-20
---
If you’re not worried about mount, go for Lionheart Helm.
---
Everything else can be raided for
---
The chest is bis for a long time, but it's not a massive upgrade over other options  Just get your mount first then worry about other stuff.
---
1st World problems
---
I don’t disagree. You don’t even need to be glad level. Duelist druids aren’t gonna be giving away free burns. But I’m pointing out that you can create enough pressure to force mistakes. It’s not like the mage and priest are just sitting there waiting to die. You can land fears on a druid in caster form. You’re a priest with offensive dispels against a caster who’s primarily healing with dispelable heals. And often times with a dps who has no way to get out of the control that the mage is dishing. Pressuring the druid into a tough spot to get off a few burns isn’t some astronomical feat. 
---
Anyway the arguments moot anyway. I didn’t say priest mage was some s tier amazing tbc comp. those were all clearly dominated by druid + X. But it was a rather uncommon completely playable comp that was a lot of fun.
---
Thorium Point is a shitshow and I share your pain. I'm an under-geared 49 undead lock and I get wailed on there most of the time.
---
The fights don't really become more complicated or hard, it just requires way more consumables for each class to preform at a high lvl. Also you need to have loot from previous raids. 
---
The cthun fight in AQ40 is not a puggable fight though unless the leader wants a headache.
---
Earthshaker level 60's in last 7 days: 61% alliance. And that is before this wave. The server is already flamelash reversed and will be so much more than that tomorrow.
---
Sounds like these server transfers weren't the best idea to combat imbalances. So other servers get hugely imbalanced and the ones with balance issues get worse?
---
You call it chaos, i call it appreciating nature.
---
F
---
Well now you have to contest azuregos with 8 alliance guilds that you can't even attack.
---
Server went from Full to High due to the amount of players who stopped playing or switched to an alt on another realm.
---
I did that too, with the expectance of transferring my main to my alt's realm once this whole thing blows over. But now?
---
Well played, Blizzard-Activision. Well played.
---
If you leave the game over a couple DHK's then good riddance.
---
It looks more here like he’s mocking blizzard or being sarcastic
---
Christ You people need to chill out
---
If you’ve played this long you should know Alliance is hard mode WOW.  Roll horde if you want a handicap, alliance if you want to prove yourself.
---
Oh, than I split it:
---
Did you (the OP) send the letter to yourself?
---
or
---
Are you (the OP) a girl?
---
OP is short for "original poster"
---
To be fair that is more or less what raiding has been in wow. You study up on bosses tactics and what your spec and consumables should be.
---
Deadly Boss Mod...  should be required honestly.
---
Best is when you're running away from a raid and a level 12 sheep's you first try.
---
i bet you are a insane coder
---
Is it a RP server?
---
If it is then rogues killing Defias traitors is
---
nothing wrong, if I may say.
---
Snitches get stitches.
---
Thats just in the base game, turn on autoloot
---
Use a lul in real life instead of actually laughing don’t you
---
Yeah, 75% was for bloodfang. Earthshaker is 61% alliance so same as flamelash but reversed. After this movement shaker will most likely reach 75% though.
---
mid september blizz removed a certain who script, which census used
---
they recently found a workaround, so the short term number should be somewhat accurate, depending on how often people let it run through
---
i wouldnt give too much on the 30days though
---
Why would retail players care if people play other games?
---
Goledn era of pvp = TBC/Wrath
---
The rule was: What could be used in arena could be used in a duel
---
this classic engineering fest pvp gets boring really fast
---
Easily solved by having worldboss coalition raids with 5-10 raiders from each guild in a loot raid with the rest guarding the kill raid.
---
Hurr durr? my 50 copper fish???
---
Dead servers will cause more players on both factions to quit. Making the problem worse.
---
The situation can't be salvaged. And Blizz is always so slow to move that the people stuck on these servers have no option but to quit.
---
Now you got plenty of servers with basically just one faction.
---
The retail auction house, it’s across from the bank in the trade district.
---
And then you have one guild that doesn't care and just makes it a tag race.
---
Good boy
---
The flame lash problem was simply caused by blizzard who doesn't give a fuck about balance
---
i am a officer in my guild. a hunter but still a officer. The guild lost about 800 g to a new tank that stopped wanting to tank after p2 hit. we had giving him a binding and when the second drop he was in the running. i currently myself have a whooping 20 g since all arcane crystal i get go towards our thunderfury. 
---
but entitlement is a redflag alot. we should have read the signs before we invested so heavy into that guy. we have a new offtank that is like you. 
---
i like you. you are a good egg
---
Mining thorium makes good money but its RNG cause the real money comes from crystals and sapphires. One morning i got 6 crystals and 2 sapphires in 2 hours on firemaw then last weekend i mined for hours and hours and didnt get any. Then sunday night i got a crystal and next morning another crystal and a sapphire from 1 node. Crystals go for 50-55g each and sapphires anywhere from 45 to 60 depending on availability on Firemaw Alliance.
---
Well, do you think the alliance population will increase in that year? You need alliance to do their faction specific war effort hand-ins or the gates won't open.
---
I play on Firemaw (alliance) and have no plans to move anywhere.
---
There's an undead rogue bot on Firemaw EU that farms in Alterac Mountains 24/7.  
---
At first I just killed him, but I figured that really wouldn't hinder a bot that much.  
---
So I started bringing him down just enough that the mobs he was fighting would kill him for durability damage. He would use evasion at low health, but keep fighting. If he barely survived combat, he would use cannibalize if available, otherwise he'd just stand there until he had &gt; 50% health or so, or until he entered combat.  
---
Once in combat, he would keep seeking targets/attacking. So, I just wanded him once and he ran off to the next ogre, which promptly turned him into bone meal.  
---
The next day he started using potions, since the bot user probably realized that his char was repairing gear an awful lot. I didn't mind, that's just more gold wasted for him.  
---
I must have gotten that bot killed ~40 times while just casually mining there.
---
So they have their own security services, impressive.
---
Timer is exactly 25 minutes.
---
No but nochanges :)
---
Good thing to learn in a video game with no consequences. Read what you agree to do with any financial transaction.
---
Since it seems obvious to you: What has the girl part go to do with anything?
---
Saw felstriker and dal rend MH both drop on the same kill about a week ago. The level 59 rogue on her second run got both of them. I've never been saltier
---
My server has an alliance majority. 
---
If I had my way they would make the entire game pvp like gurubashi arena
---
Lol, thats so funny!
---
You (and the likes of you) are literally everything that was wrong with Flamelash and why it died.
---
&gt; You never enjoyed world PvP. World PvP is glorious and an epic fight, a continuous struggle for supremacy in a zone where the battle rages and ebbs and flows, each side gaining advantage temporarily before the other side rallies and pushes back.
---
This is world PvP on a PvE server. It's quite enjoyable.
---
&gt;Not corpse camping lowbies.
---
This is world PvP on a PvP server.
---
It's almost like they saw this coming and made a type of server where faction imbalances don't matter
---
what server gives u rank 6 with 35k honor?
---
Brilliant writing, was hooked from the start. 
---
Did the warrior try briefly running away to get in Intercept range? If not he’s trash
---
Yes please
---
I don't know what you're talking about. PVP was never able to be balanced around small groups of players, regardless of what blizzard tried - and they tried a lot before just flat out giving up. It's not BGs. You just find some semblance of "balance" in large groups of players, provided you position properly.
---
War for what? A dead server?
---
Now they can enjoy the next era of just being the only faction on the server. A discount PvE server.
---
Then the coalition will compete against that 1 guild for tag.
---
then\*
---
Ah! Okay! I thought the timer starts running when you get your first ID. Good to know, thanks for pointing that out :)
---
Any tips on anything you can do against same faction hunter bots? Got one on my grind spot for quite a while. It's a place where horde hardly ever goes and I've reported him so many times (others have aswell) but he is still going strong. Why won't blizzard do anything? Watch him for 20 sec and it's obvious it's a bot. Guess it's another sub for them...
---
If only blizz listened to the community. There were plenty of suggestions to keep population/factions somewhat balanced. Imagine when they open chars transfers for $.
---
I did! Hi!
---
Do you think the people who are currently hating their servers and not enjoying the game will keep playing or something? Cause they won’t.
---
Not only the server populations. The release of no BGs with honour killed PvP servers. There's absolutely no way to reverse this shit show.
---
Pservers did a better job running Vanilla than Blizzard.
---
I never saw this kind of things happen in vanilla because it was not necessary, so da fk sre you talking about?
---
I can only speak from my perspective (alliance on Flamelash)
---
Going to BRM means adding roughly 15-20 minutes of travel time. You won't be fighting your way there; you'll be dying your way there. Sometimes if you're lucky you can piggyback off of the seldom seen alliance raid running through, but most of the time you have hordes camping all the way from Thorium Point to BRM while Morgan's Vigil is regularly patrolled or camped. Entrance to BRD and LBRS/UBRS is also heavily camped most of the time.
---
Going to Strat isn't as bad. Light's Hope Chapel is almost always camped by 10-20 hordes, but once you get away from it after 4-5 deaths you can usually run most of the way without dying. If you can find another way than by boat via Menethil, DM is pretty safe to go to as well.
---
Beyond just the added time to get to places, another big issue is that most active alliance players either only log in for raids or spend most of their time not leaving IF. Finding groups for dungeons has been getting harder and harder. Now that so many left it's almost a miracle finding a healer or a tank. Thankfully I'm leaving today with my guild, so hopefully Earthshaker will be better. Kinda sad to potentially ruin their server, but I need the game to be playable again.
---
Denial.
---
It's always the first stage.
---
And now the horde on the other server is fucked as well, for doing nothing wrong. Those alliance guilds are the ones in the wrong here, stop pretending they're doing something good.
---
It was literally 65/35, who Ch means thousands more horde online at all times. 
---
You didn't best shite, all you did was get smacked around by good players and camp lone noobs.
---
You’re both human garbage
---
&gt; just want to PVE
---
Why the fuck are you on a PVP server then? There are literally servers for PVE only, pick them.
---
There are free-for-all areas in the Gurubashi Arena in STV and outside Dire Maul where you can attack any player not in your group. 
---
Other than that, just flag yourself all the time and PvP will find you. If it doesn't work for you right then all it costs you is a corpse run and a few minutes waiting before you can unflag.
---
gnomes is the pvp race of alliance, much like undead.
---
specifically with escape artist
---
I guess he was like Rank 5 - 50% before.... because 35k honor is standing 400 (which gives u almost nothing)
---
Nice keybinds. Is that Shieldslam on......8? One of the most important abilities.
---
You forgot the "alliance are so bad, they lose every world pvp" and "alliance are just scared chickens, they always run away from me and my 73 mates"
---
No way with current items a mage will do to you 2.5k FB without AP, and if he goes AP, he wont get iceblock
---
I didnt know about outside of DM. Thank you for this advice.
---
It's crazy how someone can be this delusional. Servers aren't dying because of World PvP, ganking lowbies or anything else. I played on a fairly balanced realm in Vanilla, which had roaming gank squads and killing of low levels throughout all the span of Vanilla and it didn't change the horde:alliance ratio.
---
The issue is that Blizzard isn't doing anything to try and preserve the horde:alliance ratio. If people are on a server and realize they are outnumbered, they are slowly going to fade out to get a more balanced server. It doesn't matter with PvP or not. If they moved because of PvP, they would be on a PvE server to begin with.
---
Blizzard should have locked the creation of new characters on a realm as soon as it reached a point where imbalance happened.
---
Blizzard should have forced queues on factions to ensure both factions had access to the game.
---
Blizzard should have merged servers instead of allowing free transfers.
---
We warned Blizzard many times before Classic release, that their previous approach with transfers isn't working. It didn't work in Vanilla or any other expansion of the game. Server merging is the only thing that will work, but Blizzard won't accept that.
---
What is balanced? What do you mean by balanced? Because my definition of balanced is that, when two teams zone into Warsong Gulch, the chance of either one winning is not overly determined by comp or by the fact that they chose to take OP classes. And in that sense, yes, Warsong Gulch is reasonably balanced. The better team, which executed overall strategy better and responded better to developments in the game, always wins Warsong Gulch. You need the right ratio of healers to dps, and it helps to not have obviously weak meme specs, but at the end of the day both sides have an equal chance of winning before considering the quality of the players.
---
Obviously 1v1s outside of town are not generally balanced.
---
Destroying the balance on another server because they are pussies and lost in open world pvp? They're doing now the exact thing they always blamed the "evil" horde for.
---
Yeah, it has such a cozy atmosphere, with the main centre being pretty small compared to Orgrimmar or Undercity, but everything is green and peaceful. You can stand at the edges and admire the green pastures of Mulgore. There's even a pond in the centre where you can fish!
---
Yo what Region do you Play I'll hook you up with a month! PM me
---
If you see, there are 2-3 mobs in totem range you can set up a little camp.
---
If you are just fighting 1 mob, only use searing totem and have lightning shield up beforehand, after the last spell just hit it to death, so that your full mana-regen will start early and continue.
---
I can't really recall how the low rank damange per mana of flameshock was, but I think 2 lightning bolts will be more efficient than 1 shock - double check this.
---
Any source confirming it?
---
RPing as an honourable orc seems silly. Only one had ever existed, and he was raised by humans.
---
Also he didnt seem to have stancedance-&gt;intercept macro:ed anyways.
---
this is cyberbullying
---
The hair will go away once you have a helm, hang in there.
---
Is that a stargate SG1 reference?
---
If you do it - you eventually turn into a gnome.
---
That would be interesting lol.
---
JAB and ion hate classic with a passion, pretty they just have to do it because it was mograine that pushed it before leaving and they are stuck with it. They just expect, hope it died so they can be triumphant next blizzcon announcing their shir retail shadowland expansion with more pets, mounts and progress reset every patch. But look you are 60 now !
---
I always whisper a mage and say 2g for as much water as you can make before you run out of Mana. Then innervate him. Sometimes 2 or 3 more druids will innervate him too and I walk out with way too much water.
---
OP is right. When a class can kill its same level in 3 hits its broken af. Not to mention they have the the means to escape certain death 5x more than any other class. I see this all the time in Gadget. A mage can kill anyone in seconds with impunity and get away, you try that with melee or even an op spriest youre clubbed to death by the guards.
---
Well, you're on curve for Bracket 10-11, so you should get R7 next week at this rate.
---
Hard to say...
---
Life steal can be great, but it has set amount of times it can prog per minute, or something.
---
Crusader is obviously most powerful, but fights are shot so you will waste most progs.
---
Fiery weapon is cheap and progs lots. Great additional damage.
---
Maybe start with Fierys and upgrade if you have performance issues?
---
This here should be the number. No idea where that extra 10% applied to the top comment in this thread is coming from.
---
I guess some people are really, really happy that they can farm "PVP" honor by grinding PVE mobs.
---
This better be a real thing.
---
As a druid, I tend to teleport to moo glade and go to darnassus when my hearthstone is on cooldown. I’m seeing him quite often. But man this guy is a talker... maybe because he is too lonely...
---
Or a lvl 29 think rogue that kites him around for five minutes in front of AH while everyone watches...
---
Yes, are you are a nazi for even suggesting it
---
/s
---
It's 10 bucks. Just... eat less. Stop smoking. Take a bike instead of driving.
---
Anyone can save 10 dollars somehow. Then agian, if it's really that massive of an amount, then your priorities should probably be somewhere else for a while in order to fix that.
---
He easily dispatched the pat when I was doing mine - but my wife had to restart like couple times because of that pat. Eventually got through by AoE fearing the patrollers and giving Taelan time to heal.
---
You might have bad Druid tanks. 
---
They are generally better tanks at this stage of the game. As bosses get tougher and Warriors get more gear, they will supplant Druids overall, though druids are still great one certain fights.
---
For the time being though, they can deal crazy threat without sacrificing much survivability.
---
Yep haha, keeps things exciting at least
---
Where is it $10? It's $15 USD
---
Can in classic
---
See, this is the issue. You are acting like WoW is a job and that asking a question is somehow increasing your labor. If you don’t know the answer to a question or just want to sit in your anger and not respond, then don’t! No one is forcing you to do anything! I’d rather be a part of a community that isn’t afraid to ask questions rather than one made up of a bunch of people pretending they know more than they do and isolating themselves because they are too afraid to ask.
---
banging a satyr??hmmm is there..an art of that?
---
I've reported bots lately on classic and retail, and nothing ever seems to change. Supposedly Blizzard detects bitters. Really? Because it sure as shit doesn't seem to be working.
---
And someone once told me "they will ban them eventually, they do it in waves". Maybe, but not before their gold and inventory has filtered out into the economy for months.
---
Dragonfang
---
Charge in and use Intimidating shout when Taelan is low.
---
Wourder
---
TLDR: The honor system is a joke
---
But it's like hitting a 5 man black hole with enigma. Long cooldown, but how much better can you get?
---
Ahh okay, allies have wpl most of the time and Epl is just sort of a ongoing battle constantly switching sides, yeah searing gorge horde have had control since p2 hit
---
[The one who started it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ZBX-kckJA)
---
2.5k frostbolt crits? 1.5k fire blast crits? Where do you get those numbers from?
---
A 2.5k frostbolt would require ~900 Spelldmg, a 1.5k fire blast ~1100 spelldmg. Similar values required for lightning bolt + earthshock to hit 4k.
---
When I fight mages frostbolts usually crit for ~1.2k and fire blasts for 750.
---
naw, it doesnt affect all classes equally
---
youd expect a 2h hand of sulfuras to compete but it doesnt at all
---
I wonder how many other game developers play Classic and what their thoughts are.
---
O shit..thats the problem with too much migration
---
gHeY
---
If you wave at them and they don't wave back, it's probably a fishing bot though so go ahead and kill them.
---
That's very likely since SoF daggers is significantly easier than combat swords. Unlike combat swords, you don't have to care at all about your swing-timer and can just smash your abilities however you like.  
---
A combat rogue that doesn't time his abilities correctly will be worse than a SoF daggers rogue, however if he times his abilities correctly - using them right after his main-hand swing (in order to not reset swing before it's done with swordspec), the combat swords rogue will be better all throughout classic. It's been thoroughly theorycrafted for many many years.
---
Reported the same bot about 10 times over a month. Does nothing even though it's the most obvious bot ever created.
---
Saurfang, and his brother, Broxigar.  And further, Thura who is their niece and the inheritor of the Axe of Cenarius.
---
&gt; so yeah both of them doing 4k is pretty reasonable
---
considering the range and how fast it casts and easy it is to get off, no it isnt, not when a hand of rag melee + mortal strike crit can barely break 2.5k on cloth
---
&gt;How much does a warrior with BRE hit for if they crit twice? Its going to be the same damage, like regular weapon crit + MS crit will absolutely devastate a ton of players
---
not even close.... at all
---
caster cast+ instant is easly 3.5k-4k atm (i see 2.4k frostbolt + 1.4 fireblast pretty easily). bonereavers on cloth melee+MS crit is like, 2.5k
---
No one is a saint and wiling to stay on the losing side. No one wants a 50min brm deathrun staying in a imbalanced server is not a solution. just suck it up us not a solution. For now, players do what they must but effectively turning those servers to PVE ones until blizzard decides to do something like realm transfers or blow them up
---
They are implying you are so bad that you cant win 5v1 because you played retail and retail makes players bad.
---
Tho pvp wise the tier is great and u should aim to get 3 or 5 pieces of tier 1 depending and 2 pieces of tier 2 at least :)
---
Oh my god, yes! I recently fought a level 34 warrior on my mage twink and wanted to make it clear that I'm no harm, so I frost novad and waved at him. He immediatly broke free and I attacked me.
---
PvG - Player versus Gnome.
---
Great post and also something that even with “no changes” should be addressed. According to honorspy I’m well within the top 10% of my server. Even with this I’ll be relegated to rank 10 or so, 11 is my goal and I know I’ll have to go harder to get there. I get GM should be exclusive and only the sweatiest of sweat lords able to obtain but the blue set should be a tad easier to achieve imo.
---
The incentives heavily favor the Horde. It's no surprise we ended up in this situation. It was totally predictable given that Blizzard did **nothing** to alleviate the problem.
---
What they should have done is faction specific queues. If people knew before launch that going Horde was going to cost them more time waiting to play then more would have rolled Alliance.
---
At the **very** least Blizzard should have announced that BGs would **not** be cross server to give players intending to go Horde a reason to reconsider. They didn't even have to actually do it. Just saying BGs would be restricted to players from your server would have helped.
---
I'm on razorgore as alliance! When is the next time this happens??
---
Straight up on that kryptonite
---
Could guess the ending. It's how every arena ends.
---
Someone take my money!
---
You going to pay for the month after that too when he makes the same thread?
---
Okay, story time :
---
I remember one time where I met a truly dumb/angry/smug player. It was in week 3 or something and was doing my stuff in IF. HE asked in /1 in which dungeon he could loot a great new 2h sword. I replied that he could for exemple look at SFK/BFD/Stockade boss loot table and he will surely find his sword (he was mid twenties). 
---
He proced to bitch about how he couldn't see the loot table without alt-tabbing on wowhead. I told him nicely about AtlasLoot addon (which is basicaly the codex from retail but for classic) and he bitched more about how this addon couldn't simply be a ingame feature like retail. Yeah I get it, those little QoL change can be missed and classic isn't for everyone. So I replied that if he refused to just use the tool he could have to find his answer, I couldn't do more.
---
Io and behold, he went on a big rant about me being an elitist Pserver jerk, a dumb old man stuck in the past and that classic will just crash and that as an elitist jerk I should know every drop of every (leveling) dungeons and just spoon fed him the information without him having to search for and that classic is a bad game. 
---
The funiest thing ? I'm 24yo, never played on a PServer, played this game when I was twelve and bad at the game and have little memories about that time. I just happen to be passionate about classic and did a fcking tons of research about it prior to the launch
---
It scales with +healing.  But the cool thing about is it is it takes a snap shot of your healing when you put it on. So say you have +400 healing put on the sword then switch to your regular gear you still get healed for 420 every 5 seconds
---
Shaman is so good in groups, and fun to level too! 
---
Stop being so negative just because you're not good at it
---
isn't 13 euros just under 15 USD?
---
This is a Blizzard launch day, so it would probably be better to take a sick day on the 11th or even wait until the following week. 
---
The 10th is going to have server queues and there’s a good chance of bugs Blizzard’s QA team managed to miss that will need to be hotfixed. 
---
I can already hear the screaming outrage of people who took time off work for the release, only to find themselves stuck in a multiple hour server queue or in a buggy battleground.
---
from pvping and reading my combat logs with /all and details
---
Imagine blaming people for not wanting to participate in a hostage situation.
---
It was on horde to transfer off, with that not happening no one going to stay in a server they cant even farm in or go to brm without a 50 minute death run
---
there is a reason mages are like, 30% of the player base atm... and it sucks the life out of the game
---
dang you got 12 DHKs solo?
---
Yeah sap is so op here .You needed that pet!If only you didn't die to lowbie hunter
---
The patient bird gets the worm
---
I'm really tired of people who play horde on horde-dominated PVP servers calling Alliance pussies
---
Good luck doing anything productive on a 30:70 server as alliance. Some of these ratios are an absolute joke and the general behaviour of the dominant faction is embarrassing.
---
I'm lucky I'm on a relatively even server, but if you can't play the game because of horde camping you everywhere you go then you're not a 'pussy' for leaving.
---
This is Blizzards fault for not restricting char creation for the dominant faction and not enabling faction specific queues.
---
Depends on your country. In my case it gets converted from Forint (which is a very shitty currency). Sometimes it gets near equal but usually it's more than 15$ in real world value.
---
That's an interesting turn of events - guess [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) hasn't caught up with that yet, since it's still stating 39:61 A:H. Certainly will be interesting to see how it developes.
---
What was your greatest memory of Classic?
---
And are you planning on coming back when you can work again?
---
That does suck, luckily were pretty even faction wise it seems here on Razorgore. 
---
I 100% would not be still play had the server still been heavily horde sided.
---
You should start smoking then, so that you can save the money later by quitting.
---
Well maybe he is able to save half a Sub in a month and he will be able to afford it next month. 
---
Maybe someone else will pay. 
---
Maybe he will stop next month.
---
Maybe he will not even take my offer.
---
So many Option I'm just trying to make someone happy. What about you?
---
Not what he asked, and also both systems have pro's and con's  
---
1 is not better than the other, perse
---
This is the second week in a row where this has happened and both times it been on Wednesday at about 8pm Server time!!
---
I do sometimes wonder what kind of person could play a fucking Gnome for so many hours. But, mostly it's the race design and concept. The voices are annoying. The look is crap. The animations are ridiculous.
---
It’s against sub rules, for good reason. Posts that do that are removed... and 99% of the time scammers do this shit from a level 1 alt specifically so they don’t have to suffer any consequences.
---
Just FYI, the term is *proc*. Programmed Random OCcurrence.
---
&gt;Retail and twitch ruined classic for everyone
---
You are fooling no one but yourself.
---
it would make me raidlog. I am on my way to r14 (i am top 5 standing so far).
---
It means I took time off work for nothing (I am a freelance programmer, so I simply declined clients until february).
---
No, they're doing something great.  It's gonna be hilarious when rank 1 for horde on that server is 5k honor and horde storm the forums yelling at Blizzard.
---
It's worth it either way just because it takes so much effort.
---
But for use in BGs, it's great if you are Horde and not so much if you are Alliance. Priests can also dispel the absorb but they have plenty of other things to worry about in battlegrounds. It's those damn Shamans who purge spam. 
---
Ganking out in the world is where the trinket really shines.
---
Out of curiosity on splits for MC.  Did you take a 40 man and split into 2 20-mans or did you have a decent bench and were able to split around 25-30?
---
&gt; They're also almost always on the AH for sale (normally at a good price too) just because there's so much competition for crafting these items.
---
But you still need a blacksmith to apply them.
---
two dollars to make.
---
At least your bank alt's armor matches and he looks good while the orc probably looks like a clown in mismatched armor.
---
Even as a rogue it's pretty awful, Gorge/Steppes/BRM in particular
---
If you have the money ready, just buy it.  
---
or else you could farm to exalted to AV, and that mount will cost you around 40G or something
---
I‘m on a balanced server so no reason to change anything. I don’t transfer off to other balanced servers together with my whole faction to fuck them off though.
---
https://youtu.be/untDwbd9OKs
---
So that they can go to BRM without corpse hopping for 30 mins, or take a flight path without dying to 3 rogues everywhere.
---
nope you get what you chose
---
The AQ gate would never open.
---
I believe they don't.  Think it says melee critical strike only.
---
If you have 10 warriors in your guild, taking either means pretty much you have to pass on BRE, so i can understand that
---
Primary rifles have been literally the same 2 guns for 15 years up until this year.
---
Nope, Honored is the only reputation discount in vanilla/classic.
---
get more binds bro
---
Yes hunter should not farm hoj, ever. 
---
IF it drops in a normal run they should pass on it. 
---
It's an item that can take a 100 runs to get, the hunter would have already replaced it by now while a warrior/rogue are still using and will for many more months 
---
A hunter needing this against a warrior/rogue is one of the bigger fuck you they can do
---
Oof. Someone didn't get their tendies tonight.
---
SS reck, pretty average, nothing to see here.
---
People will do anything if you let them. A:H ratio has been a known problem on private servers for years and it has been solved. Blizzard decided not to do anything to address this problem that could have easily be prevented and now a portion of the playerbase is paying the price. As much as I hate the horde for being dicks it's ultimately Blizzard's fault for allowing this to happen by simply enabling the horde to be dicks without any consequences whatsoever in the entirety of Classic WoW.
---
Fuck that guy, you keep being you not too many nice people in the world so keep being a great person
---
What ui are you using?
---
BWL has more variance on time.  Nef is especially long, chromaggus (from what I remember) is fairly long.  Razor is only long I think due to add phase done 1st.  Vael and Broodlord however I believe should be fast and drakes slightly longer unless ebonroc heals for a lot.

---
Seems that Feral kitty is doing all right.
---
What is all this leather warriors are rolling on? The only piece would be mask of the unforgiven, and maybe cadaverous chest.
---
PvP servers when they're relatively balanced are insanely fun to play on as a level 60.  IMO more fun than normal.
---
If I was to play on any highly imbalanced server, fuck that I'll take a normal server.
---
he asked for a new way to keep track of loot for raiding, easy download monolith dkp, use dkp, done.  
---
dkp supports those who try in a guild, round robin does not.
---
He’s just really into prog rock
---
Prior to phase 2, 99% of the gankers I encountered were gnomes. Predominantly mages.
---
Awesome, but unfortunately it's a bad example. There were a bunch of 60s in that raid helping them :\
---
The #nochanges people would go apeshit if Blizzard did this.
---
&gt; Now imagine the T/CT's could buy unique guns the other team couldn't. 
---
Yeah imagine that - only that its a core part of Counter-Strike.
---
Ironforge on [Flamelash](https://i.imgur.com/XktVd83.jpg) vs [Earthshaker](https://i.imgur.com/L4PZ6jx.jpg) at about 9am. Notice the corpses on Flamelash. Two horde rogues were having a blast. 4677 auctions on Flamelash vs 12852 on Earthshaker.
---
This happens on my gnome as well. I noticed it’s right in front of the los pillar in the pool. If you take a step back it won’t make you stuck swimming.
---
There was a Level 57 Bot Rouge in Azshara Farming the Satyrs. Really weird movements and He Always did 2 jumps after engaging a target.
---
So me AS a warlock i Just banished His Targets couple Times and He still attacked and used abilities 
---
After a good amount of time He Whisperer me with:Pls  nononono and some Chinese Letters.
---
Then He hearthed Back to Orgrimmar and came  Back an hour later.  After me banishing again He logged out and never came Back
---
Happened on Transcendence-EU German
---
Depends on how you value your time. In sweden for example earning $15 per hour is pretty standard if you get a random job at some factory. I'd rather work 1h and pay for it compared to doing something boring ingame for 3-6 hours to then play.
---
For some reason, it was pink in mu mind when I had thought of it. Maybe my saturation setting is too high.. my bad. I am using the teal version of this mob as my pet :)
---
Details and reccount
---
okay lol doesn’t really ruin it for me, its still funny seeing the level 60 horde get swarmed by a bunch of level 1s
---
You misunderstood me. I meant the point of the transfers should be to balance the server pops and not create further discrepancy.
---
I never knew I needed something so much!
---
Just expect a ton of horde guilds to transfer to Earthshaker to chase the alliance around.
---
It's because you're thinking about the guide wrong. You don't go farm relentlessly for the next step in the "guide" just because you've hit that threshold. It's simply showing you the best available item at intervals. 
---
I used whirlwind axe from level 30 until I bought kang the decapitator at level 46 and I still use kang at 60. 
---
If your item is serviceable, you don't have to go farm for a minor upgrade.
---
Improved fd isn't mandatory for DMT though
---
Sup y'all it's me
---
I have this one and the bloodfang, each bought for $120. The quality isn't good enough for the price. They are rough and scratchy, the thread sucks so it unravels and the colored patches are fraying despite only having worn them a handful of times. I've never washed them either because I am worried they will fall apart. They just hang up in the closet.
---
Im not gonna lie i never got into wow i appreciate it as a game for what it is but i have no idea what is happening any time I watch this game
---
Just flag up and keep your eyes open for other flagged people on the other side, and then attack them. Solved !
---
yeah, I didnt read it rightly. I thought All the info was for classic :D 
---
Thankfully still time to grind the hand ins I need.
---
You are right, I actually started the guide in classic and it evolved...im an idiot.
---
Omg dude this is an mma fight
---
This should be pretty easy to look up in gudies, but all rogues in my guild use crusader
---
I play Horde because I like the races and don't like Alliance races. Also you can pretty much permanent camped on anything even on 50/50 servers. It's what you sign up for on a PvP server. So yes: PvP on a PvP server happened. Should have rolled PvE if you wanted to farm stuff in peace.
---
&gt;You are right, I actually started the guide in classic and it evolved...im an idiot.
---
 You are right, I actually started the guide in classic and it evolved...
---
 right, I actually started the guide in classic and it evolved...
---
lol what
---
Update: finally got the frost saber on my human rogue tonight!
---
Fire elementals in arathi
---
The best tank weapons for TPS (more important as MT than mitigation) are daggers tho.
---
you were just saying it that way in your video. was making me laugh. good video though. my alt was right at 200 herbing and i was wondering where to go next.
---
thanks
---
Annex (2 raid groups clearing MC and Onyxia) is going strong on ally side.
---
oooooh lord we are on the same page! had the same thoughts
---
My entire guild just came over the past few days. Got 50+ of us.
---
ironforge pro uses only raid logs so it's wildly inaccurate for measuring real population.
---
Which then suicide your attempts.
---
Wow the comments here are so dumb, that was very nice of them! I’m sure you also learned a lesson about clicking through things quickly too haha
---
76 over 9 weeks.
---
Well since even the loser faction gets to kill the officers and cap the towers, that's enough honor. I wonder how much rep and honor you get from leveling 51-60 all in AV.
---
Ctrl+R I believe
---
On my server I get the most 1v1s in TM/SS anyway, just roam around and look for people drinking/eating and poly them if they mount up.
---
Otherwise I've had some success in front of OG. If I hit the guards there someone goes to check out the OG is under attack message sooner or later.
---
Checking a guide is a lot different from classwork or getting a degree. It isn't a lot to look up your talent build, rotations, and BiS. Ez to bring up the Wowhead and refer back to it
---
Standard reply from a ganker
---
Flurry axe is better than CHT even with edgemasters.
---
Well even if they put the PvE servers into the mix as well the PvP server will still be a lot more players. So the imbalance would only be lessened and not canceled out.
---
What spec, what lvl??????
---
Daggers or swords?
---
Thanks horde too for this. A bit easy to shame only blizzard. They are not playing the characters in the death squad roaming around BRM
---
Earthshaker feels like a good realm. I am sure we Horde still outnumber you, but I meet a good amount of alliance and get ganked in the while, and Alliance always ganks us with 100+ people when we want to enter MC on Sundays. 
---
Feels like the server is alive and well
---
Is the guide telling you to replace bonebiter with morgraine's might or is simply letting you know that morgraine's might exists?

---
Ok. Thanks!
---
You can’t deathwish in Arms spec. Death wish is the sweeping strike equivalent for the fury tree.
---
Motherfucking Dunkirk
---
Lol why would they do that, they were still one of the top alliance guilds. Also your guild “clearing content every night” Does not have anything with server balance to do and doesnt require a whole lot
---
In vanilla nothing happened. You either rerolled or paid for a character transfer and paid transfers didn’t come until much later. The approach was very hands off. Server stayed open and dead.
---
Because Pservers released with BGs.
---
There was no point in wPvP.
---
But on Classic, Blizzard fucked up.
---
And now they won't address the problem and some servers will stay dead indefinitely.
---
Would go lifesteal or 2x fiery until u get 15 agi in p3.
---
Cross server BG's were introduced in 1.12
---
Lmao people haven't been able to transfer of kromcrusher for weeks, playing alliance is hell.
---
This isn't Reddit being pedantic, but me.
---
I try to gank em but annoying ass alliance keep joining in :(
---
sure, if you're a douchebag
---
Like the guy I commented on initially explained spells should be compared to skills aka MS and such.
---
The same as average dmg compares to other average dmg and crits compared to other crits.
---
I agree mages are OP but it’s about the entire game being a Rock Paper Scissors thing you’d be totally OP over other classes and they rage on you.
---
Earthshaker might be ally-favored now, but I doubt it. Horde guilds keep trickeling in from time to time.
---
Gonna end up being a great server I think
---
If you group up in numbers then you need a lot more kills to keep up honor-wise. And the thing is, a lot of players will simply leave a zone if they hear of a roaming ganksquad, because it threatens their own honor grind. 4-5 is still ok, but on my server I see a lot of 10 man (!) ganksquads, which is ridiculous
---
I stand corrected sir!
---
Well, I use elvui for my bag, minimap and buffs, so why not.
---
This is why people bitching about warriors having it tough are bad.  Warriors are so goddamn OP in this game it's a joke.
---
I spotted someone had listed Stockade Pauldrons at vendor price with no buyout the other day. With 'medium' time left they were on like 9g. I sent a mail to the seller to tell him what happened and he let me have them for 75g - under half what the others on the AH were going for. That was a good day.
---
Well he is a gnome, he had it's coming
---
Yeah and I find it super strange. Like why are we locked in here but Flamelash which was known to have shit balance wasn't?
---
"Jerking of the monkey" is still my favorite
---
Unless they are rank 3 or higher, we all know what kind of fishing you're really doing
---
What was also predictable AF was that faction imbalance breeds even more faction imbalance because people would transfer off imbalanced servers, causing imbalance elsewhere, triggering people to move off, causing imbalance elsewhere and so on. AND THIS WAS ALREADY AN ISSUE BACK IN 2006! 
---
Most  PvP servers back then were horribly imbalanced. Not all, and maybe it did not matter as much on the many, many low to mid pop servers, but this problem has always existed. Oh, and I (and others) got downvoted into oblivion prior to Classic release for predicting that exactly this would happen - because somehow people became convinced that these shoddy-ass alternate ruleset servers with a barely supported gameplay style (open wPvP) were the only true way to experience what was essentially developed as a PvE-focused EverQuest clone.
---
hahahah yea gotta have fun with it :)
---
I’m honestly bummed I didn’t choose this hairstyle on my undead. Now I’m stuck with the regular boring long hair.
---
Just try it on a different server? Make a few horde characters, delete them, then make an alliance char?
---
I wish i could say the same for the none homeless guy in a bookstore years ago pitching a tent and leaking like a faucet while reading 50 shades of grey at the stand, was fucking disturbing.
---
12 hours a day for bracket 12 is a bit exaggerated, 13 and 14 will vary depending on if you play on a wild west server or have structured bracket stacking
---
This is because blizzard pretty much doesn’t acknowledge faction imbalance. Realm transfers are supposed to be purely about total pop
---
Lol I loled
---
dude it's 2019 and you can suck a fat one
---
It's so satisfying to watch Gnomes die.
---
I'd buy a good weapon and head to Hinterlands and grind the turtles next to the horde post.
---
If you're Alliance on a PvE server, do the same.
---
If you're Alliance on a PvP server, go Blasted Lands and farm your buff items.
---
well did you curse and swear at him when he moaned about the lack of xp from the run?  If you did, then you've been banned for harassment. No way you've been banned for taking 10g off someone for a boost run, and then being reported as they think it wasnt value for money. You must have been abusive towards the guy.
---
At 8 there was more lvl 60 alliance in IF on earthshaker, than on flamelash.
---
Evolved into non classic content? 
---
You didnt even read it over once before posting it? Your guide is pretty trash dude. You haven't came up with any of it yourself
---
+5/Crusader
---
When 15 is released (ZG iirc)
---
Crusader/15 Agi.
---
The cavalry is here.  Levelling is going to be more interesting now.
---
No point theorycrafting in the games current state. Blizzard has already admitted its broken and wont be fixed for weeks, if ever. People are being reimbursed hundreds of thousands of honor, being reimbursed no honor, resetting rank, losing ranks on server crashes. Or all of the above.
---
Our small guild, the Horde Slappers, are all moving out today. :-(
---
8-10% chance to spawn, hes half as likely as the other 5, who are like 18% spawnrates
---
Where to?
---
As a frost Mage a Warrior has yet to beat me 1v1
---
You mean for 3 months :D
---
Alliance would transfer to Skeram like Horde would transfer to Heartseeker lol.  The servers with that bad of a population imbalance are doomed PvP-wise.
---
What server?
---
80g was a fraction of what I lost. I gave my guild a heads up of what was going on and that I got tricked. I logged in to this, which was a kind gesture. 
---
Who cares about one’s sex, it holds no weight on whether one has fallen victim to a scam.
---
Its measuring the population that matters. Who cares about people who don’t do shit, they’re not a contribution to the game anyways
---
Funny how this "trash site that is always wrong" is showing the *exact* same figure
---
Was ganking horde in EPL. Orc War ressisted my rogue stuns. In 5 sec I was dead. Checking logs. 2 auto hits by 1k, 1k something overpower and execute with 1k overkill. All crits. \o/
---
Earthshaker it looks like
---
attack power is just out of control
---
1,8k aimshots from hunters and 1,5k whirlwinds from warriors, seems like atp scaling is way off and/or armor is bugged
---
Good thing battlegrounds aren't 1v1 then, eh?  1v1 in WoW is basically never relevant outside of dueling.
---
So we're back where we were in Vanilla already with people wanting the game to be balanced around what a class can do with all cooldowns, in a 1 v 1, with RNG on their side?  Compare that to a 1750 hand of rag crit, a HOJ proc that crits, an MS and a WW, which can be done in 2 globals. Or a ret paladin with a Hand of Rag crit, SoC crit, judgment crit, HOJ proc all within a hammer of justice. 
---
Mage, and especially frost mage is a hard counter against warriors, if a mage catches you so you don't get the charge, you don't have your trinket up, your FAP up, and grenades, you're screwed. That's how the game works.
---
Thats exactly what we are doing ;)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXqk0lZA-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXqk0lZA-4)
---
Where are they going?
---
Warrior.
---
Waving interrupts the cast, it’s just inefficient.
---
What party bar addon is that?
---
Got to EPL and grind in the spider caves, next to the river separating WPL/EPL.  Nobody goes there!  Plenty of mobs to kill and grind on. 
---
Also, go to the bottom of tanaris, where Cuergo;s gold is done. Level 50 turtles are easy to grind on, and again, very few people ever come here. if they do, they are level 45-48 doing Cuergo's gold.
---
Nobody is an asshole about BiS. If you meet assholes all the time you are the problem :)
---
Lol that’s a big brain moment, but no. Was just a thoughtful person in my guild whom I don’t rly talk to.
---
that's just your biased opinion man
---
most warriors global me even with soullink spec
---
This is the equivelant of a lvl 1 begger character's copy paste in-game :)
---
You tanks think you can do whatever you want, dont you
---
Level or years old?
---
Yeah exactly!
---
It was around 214kg. And I'd think that no one has hit it yet.
---
CN1 萨弗拉斯
---
Not to mention: what's the point?
---
No purpose in PvE as the people who can farm rank14 are very probably in hardcore guilds that will stomp on BWL and AQ40 two hours after the release even without anyone with r14 weapons and for PvP? well you get the best weapon when you have no objective left and probably totally fed up with it.
---
I just did a census with two accounts at the same time.
---
135 online alliance, out of this 50 lvl 60. 601 for horde and 284 lvl 60.
---
That is 15% alliance at lvl 60 and 85%. There are 5.7 more horde at lvl 60 which means almost 6 horde for 1 alliance player.
---
I mean, people asked for #nochanges. You have it. The design flaw is literally **15 years old.** Everyone knew what a fuck-fest the honorsystem is, even with BGs it wouldn't have helped. There you go. #Nochanges.
---
Truestrike shoulders and the mask of the unforgiven I'm thinking, if you're strictly following prebis lists. In regards to a chest, I'd opt for one with crit over ap to keep flurry going.. so the  savage gladiator chain, or much easier to obtain deathdealer breastplate. Hell, even 3 piece black dragonscale.
---
Oh well it's only going to matter for a week. I might not get 15 kills over the next few days but then BGs will be up and I'll barely leave Orgrimmar anyway. My alt's going to have a good time levelling after all.
---
No, it hasn't. It was 59/41.
---
So flamelash will be dead on alliance side and earthshaker will be dead on horde side.
---
I don't really see how this improves things.
---
As someone who is still rank 1, how long until I can expect to get my R14 gear?
---
Druid’s can use pots and healthstones last time I checked
---
Allies will reap the benefits as soon as bgs come out.
---
And most of horde players will get shit on by premades after hour+ long queues while horde premades will probably swap servers
---
Balance :D = both factions gets fucked on different time frames.
---
Eh, rogues domination was cut by pvp trinket. Not to mention I'm an orc with mail/bis shield. I highly doubt the 100+ rogues I've dueled are all bad, esp if full epics.
---
Thanks. 
---
I feel quite bad about my chain camping. I’m glad I can retire soon. I feel like such scum to farm honor this way... but it’s faster than anything else and I can watch YouTube while I’m doing it.
---
1200 Lightning bolt hits? That's insane and completely impossible.
---
Your LB rank 9 deals 380 dmg baseline and you get 5% from talents, so you need to reach ~1150 dmg before that. That's 770 dmg and LB has a coefficient of 85%, so 906 Spelldmg required to reach 1.2k hits.
---
Even a 1.2k LB crit at your level is hard to get, as that would need 235 Spelldmg.
---
I'm so fucking tired of losing reed rolls as a mage to priests, god damnit
---
Ive always wondered why a gnome warrior is better with daggers?
---
Blizz won't do anything. 
---
There is no rule or any policy that all realms should be balanced. As for the single faction left on the realm - they will play in the world they have created.
---
If you’re sick of being outnumbered you’re going to be interested in playing as a dominant faction, it’s human nature.
---
maybe you're just bad at the game?
---
Meanwhile the Flamelash Horde
---
[Flamelash Migration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXqk0lZA-4)
---
I understand,
---
thanks for the reply.
---
This must suck so bad for who gets it :D
---
No it won't. You find bascially 15 ally rekting Kargath every time you log in. The server is completely unplayable to Horde due to all ally refugees.
---
Yeah just means warriors will never win a single duel
---
You're completely missing the point. The thread was about badly informed players and the expectations of others. Most of us here know the game in and out and know bis gear for most classes and specs and this discussion about hoj is pointless for us.
---
But many here have the expectation and clearly stated that new and uninformed players should just look up some quick guides and bis-lists for their classes and "just do 5 minutes of research", so things like that wouldnt happen. But thats exactly what would happen if as in this example i.e. an alliance hunter who was new to vanilla looked up his bis-list in p1 from those guides, trying to cater to the tryhard veteran nerds. 
---
Because most of those guides and bis lists dont use any common sense and some are even very misinformative. They literally only list the very best possible item in each slot, completely irrelevant of how feasible they are to try and obtain, how much of an upgrade they actually are in comparison to other much more easily obtainable second-best options, or wether they are much better used by another class. The best examples of terrible misinformation (or rather just bad advice) seen in bis-guides are HoJ for hunters, the ony head tank-trinket for warriors, or the random-enchanted sunken temple blues with "of frozen wrath" or "of shadow wrath" (the time spent farming these, which get replaced in mc, would be much better invested doing literally anything else, especially since these guides are mostly intended for noobs and casuals).
---
Plans with BS is solely to help my guild. We've been collecting mats for TB rep so come p3 i can get the epic plans i need. For the guild! But yeah it would have made sense to save for my epic mount now but what is done, is done lol
---
You are likely giving good advice here. The problem though is that people give advice and try to help guide others, but seem unable to provide exact info on how abilities work. That is what I want: Info on how things work, without any evaluation of what is good or bad. That way, we can all figure out the best way to do things, rather than just having to take someones advice without knowing whether it is actually correct.
---
This is why I have been trying to figure out some things:
---
* Focus regen: What is the regen rate, and how often and how big are the ticks? I understand that it is 5 focus / sec, but I don't know how often the ticks are.
---
* Furious Howl: I understand that if FH is applied while a shot is in the air, the shot will consume the FH, but not get the dmg bonus. It would also seem that FH is not normalized, so it adds the same dmg range to every attack no matter the attack speed of the recepient.
---
The problem is that when I ask for information, people reply with opinions about what is best, instead of supplying info on how stuff works.
---
LOL I hope you guys come too, I don’t want to play on a server that is tilted heavily to ally. Just one where we have fair fights
---
I don't understand how people can play with this UI.
---
Everything is so cluttered and the pops up fill the entire screen, I could barely see whats going on.
---
Memeshaker ofc
---
Don't lie. Earthshaker is at least 70/30 alliance after this.
---
Yeah it's too late, Horde created that world, they must live in it now. I have 0 sympathy if they start to cry when they can't rank at all anymore.
---
You do you man. We need more people like you.
---
yes
---
Congratz, enjoy your dead PvE realm. You're at the same problem as us mate.
---
I've had some fun skirmishes in Winterspring, at the Winterfall Village. Lots of people go there to farm raid consumables and rep, and if you enable yourself and start tagging mobs, someone will take the bait.
---
A lot of raiding guilds don't upload raidlogs at all thus being nonexistent on ironforge pro. They are however very much existent in BRM griefing and camping lowbies. I'd say that matters pretty much.
---
Keep em coming
---
Thanks for your input. I've done a few dm:e drop runs with some guildies, so i know the run, but i was below 275 mining when i did them. However this is now a viable option as i can farm rich thorium veins. Ty for your input :)
---
&gt; caster cast+ instant is easly 3.5k-4k atm (i see 2.4k frostbolt + 1.4 fireblast pretty easily).
---
Ir's not, it's more like 2k. The dmg oyu describe would require Spelldmg values, which are at best obtainable with Naxx gear, if at all.
---
The only way you can possibly take this dmg is when you fight a mage with recklessness on and they have talisman + arcane power activated. That's the only possible explanation.

Sorry for stupid question. If i pull 50k hp weekly, what bracket im in? Tnx
---
&gt; Some classes are objectively stronger than others
---
wrong. every class excels in another area
---
Such bad advice. The game will completely change next week as far as wpvp and there are some severe imbalances on pvp realms that absolutely do not need more horde. If you really are concerned with possivly having a harder time, go pve server. New players should go with what they want, but telling them to just go horde because it's easier is bs. I would encourage all players rolling on a new server to roll alliance because you will help balance this game and you wont have gnarly queues for bgs. If you dont care about bgs/wpvp as much it wont matter, but the alliance side needs help, it's in a place where it's still an underdog, but it will be defeated completely on many servers if the influx of horde continues.
---
No one listened to the complains, so its each their own now
---
Honestly I would just go out and mine, but with wpvp atm it's practically impossible to do any sort of solo world farming. So until bg's that option isn't viable. Even though bgs is in a week!
---

Fully bugged warrior with flask against no buff warrior “ez clap”

Im on dreadmist and recognise some of these names, deffo seen smorcc a few times
---
Hes probably horde. No axe in MC

Danger zone
---
15 agi enchant should be released in P3, if I'm not mistaken.
---
DM:E jump runs, then.
---
not on horde, which he probably is
---
On private servers people succesfully pugged AQ40. The asterisk here being that it wasn't really full pugs, more like a solid core 20ish people who knew what they did and grabbed other people who also knew what they were doing (geared / prepared etc).
---
BWL is pretty easily puggable, it takes a while for people to figure out how stuff works but once they do i t's really not that hard to grasp and the gear requirements are still very loose compared to something like Huhuran, where either you have people with NR or you just don't down her.
---
I think pugging will pick up steam with BWL and AQ40 because it has a lot more casual players than private servers did which means a lot people who are capable of doing the fights, but not necessarily able to commit to a guild's raiding schedule, time-wise. So their only options are to ei ther do MC ad infinitum or pug.

The thing is, most people who roll on PvP servers *don't* want peace. That's why they roll there in the first place. But there's a big difference between having to be careful of the opposite faction and literally not being able to play the game because of constant camping and ganking. When I roll PvP, I'm going in wanting to play the game and enjoy the faction war aspect of it fully - if I can't even hit level 10 because I get stomped into the dirty by a raid full of level 60s the instant I leave any major city, and that persists for days or weeks without changing, there's a serious problem beyond just "PvP happening on a PvP server".
---
What the Alliance is complaining about isn't world PvP or even (usually) ganking. Even corpse camping isn't that much of a problem, despite being rather annoying when done for too long. When I look at the actual problem, I'd hesitate to even call it PvP at all. It's the lowest, most pathetic and detestable form of multiplayer play short of outright hacking/scamming - actively going out of your way to ensure that someone else (or rather, as many someone elses as you can possible manage) is physically incapable of progressing in the game.
---
I wanted PvP, but this isn't PvP. It's something far more pathetic and deplorable - it's griefing.
---
I agree. ES is a great server. Moved here with my guild from Gehennas a couple of weeks ago. Then ES was in the low/medium range but had a nice community going on. Now it’s much more populated but still has a nice balance to it in terms of people, pve/pvp, horde/alliance etc. I hope that balance can maintain!
---
yes 3% hit and 10% white damage

The gear is much better than in Vanilla, and there are plenty of guides for literally all bosses. Unless you pick 20 monkeys, you will be able to Pug all the content (the hardest will just take longer). Vanilla was "hard" because there was no info on what to do on boss X or Y. Now you just open google and type "Heigen dance" and you just watch the youtube and read the guide and practice it various times until it cleared.  The game is not hard, it is time consuming to get decent gear (and even this can be done quite fast if you some decent people to team for dungeons)
---
A broken clock is right twice a day. Doesnt make it any less broken
---
With the gnome racial it's more about the extra little bit of crit you get with said extra intellect for basically free as opposed to the increased mana pool.
---
My best axe will have in on it come AQ
---
Because everyone had their goals which they enjoy achieving. Like farming the gold for their epic mount or Lionheart helm. And those goals include MAKING GOLD, which is pretty much impossible to do solo, as a tank. And if those tanks can't make money TANKING, then they have literally zero reason to be running that dungeon. So no, they (no anyone else) have no position to help you run your dungeon FOR FREE. You selfish PoS.
---
Sad that this even needs to be explained to you, but here we are.
---
I think the confusion is the following: the SM lock using corruption will not do more damage than the DS lock not using it, with 150sp less. The sim is about the difference in DPS increase of the SM lock versus the DS lock when they'd both be using corruption. The increase is larger for the SM lock, unless the DS lock has a lot more sp. The sp difference is smaller if both locks have the same amount of suppression (50-100).
---
Yeah no worries we are already migrating
---
I think I will start doing this. Couldn't get details to work with overall damage, but I still want to check individual fights
---
Wotlk to be exact. Was still ignored in ICC for ret paladins as the leather belt was too good
---
It's true you are not getting the full value out of defense against low lvl mobbs, because they already have a high chance to miss on you, and they have no chance to crit you, but you still get the increased chance to parry/dodge/block wich is nice. T2 gear would give you more lifesteal if you are using the shield and/or breastplate, wich might overall provide more damage mitigation than defense especielly at the lower level dungeons where the mobbs don't hit hard, once you get close to the scarlet dungeons though i have a feeling that defense might provide more damage mitigation than spellpower lifesteal, but i have not done much testing on that. As for the Uthers strength trinket, i was actually planning on doing some testing with that today :)
---
is it one more guide to spam arcane explosion?
---
there is a not so thin line between getting outnumbers occsionally or getting outnumbered almost the entire time.  
---
this is where faction imbalance comes into play.
---
you are fighting a constant uphill battle with no way of retaliating as you are simply lacking the numbers to do so.  
---
if you ever manage to organize yourself the opposite factions has a way easier time to counter this again by numbers alone.
---
its not the losing sometimes that is bothering people, its the losing all the time.  
---
I know no one who would enjoy this.
---
How many do you know? And what’s the bloodfang/earthshaker split
---
That's incorrect, you don't get a nameplate on you during Feign Death. Someone would have to mouse over him, notice the sword cursor and click on him, you can't even be tab targeted during Feign Death.
---
In theory you could, but I doubt anyone will take nearly that long.
---
Shouldn't it hearth back after you killed it that many times due to damaged armor?
---
Wanting something for your time is greedy? You're dumb as hell.
---
Boots of the shadowflame are also bis for feral tanks by a margin (very high armor, which is often overlooked). If your guild has a feral tank he should get first prio on them before any dps.
---
And im not so sure that they are better for warriors than chromatic boots, chromatic give 40 AP (44 with bok or 48 for palas with bok + talent), 1% crit (1.1% with bok) and 1% hit. You would have to be either crit-capped or hit-starved to prefer shadowflame over chromatic.
---
This. This is what every PvP oriented player should read. Majority of people are wasting their time to PvP in first wave... Just wait for BGs and after first tryhards have their r14s.
---
Shadowed unit frames
---
Because different people like different things. It's as simple as that.
---
I just rerolled to a PVE server. Just got my mount on my warrior yesterday.  I love it alot more
---
leather would more be 15 for warrior 10 for rogue
---
Literally never was 59/41, not even on launch, you lying moron. 
---
Not even sure why you're doing it, tbh.
---
I'd give it some time to level out. There's a whole lot more reason for ally to be running census reports to get an idea than on the horde side. 
---
Last 14 days shows around 2000 characters between 55-60 for both factions.
---
Last 7 days shows 600 horde and 1700 alliance. You're looking at bad data.
---
Vurtne
---
Considering Alliance guilds are complaining about being ganked but stagger to MC/Onyxia one by one being picked off by small groups of Horde instead of going as an organized raid of 40 is definitely a big reason.
---
There was no real organization on Alliance side. Even when you guys had the numbers you did nothing with it really. It was pretty sad to see.
---
Paladins (the class the OP is talking about) only have Hammer of Justice (a spell) which is on the spell hit table, not physical.
---
Blind is a ranged attack, and also uses the physical hit table.
---
And it’s somewhat balanced faction wise too. Best server.
---
Cant say anything yet about the other guilds but us (Nightlife) will bring the Mainraid + Socialraid to Earthshaker
---
No, every city had auctioneers. But each city had an isolated auction system - if you posted auctions in Darnassus, only players browsing the AH in Darnassus could ever see it. Likewise, browsing AH in Darnassus meant you could only see things posted in Darnassus. That and the centrality of the cities to popular game objectives is why players congregated in IF and Orgrimmar.
---
I'll copy my comment from elsewhere here:
---
It doesn't look like (certainly Bloodfang) is getting messed up, rather that the original 55:45 balance is getting slightly skewed towards 55:45 for ally.
---
its relevant if you are out in the world doing stuff, which is a huge % of playing wow for most people
---
A little low on the priority list for weapons from MC (aside from sorcerous dagger, maybe?). Should I throw 30sp on Witchblade or Blade of the New Moon? 
---
PvP focused warlock with a mix of raid epics and pre-raid.
---
We're in a threat about ret Paladin. I'm talking about our Hammer of Justice, a magical spell that causes a magical debuff. It uses spellhit, it can be resisted.
---
Ads are getting smarter. Made me buy it
---
Ya I wanted to tell him that I get 95 parses doing my strat, but that would just be contributing to the idea that meters matter. 
---
I see some healers that only cast flash heal because that's what top parses do without realizing why those players are doing it. Their dos is high enough to kill mc bosses in 60 seconds so they spam max rank flash heal woth 5 healers in the raid so they can parse.
---
See you there next week!

Look, just click that up-arrow, +1 his Facebook, follow him on Instagram and buy his handcrafted perlers on Etsy while watching his Youtube channel.

Don't you know becoming famous on the Internet works!?!?!?

Ziggity zoomer shit his britches like a Boomer, now the poor lad doesn't get any pooner.
---
I am trying to complete Investigate the Alchemist Shop, and im doing the Cantation of manifestation spell, but no mobs will spawn. Is the quest bugged?
---
This isn't a valid comment on a video with recklessness
---
They have merged realms in the past
---
I would never deny that this can not happen. dedication goes a long way.  
---
you are still looking at a clear outlier here. most players are either incapable or unwilling to put in the amount of effort if would require to stand a chance.
---
idk what kind of sport you are into, but let me explain this with a soccer example.  
---
if you team is down 4 players compared to the oppnent, making it a 7v11. there may be some teams that can hold their own for a long time, or even pull wins.  
---
yet in the long run even they will tire out and lose.  
---
we are talking about exceptional teams here, which most players are not a part off unfortunately.
---
Hunters 100%.
---
Whoever is saying mage doesn't even understand how much you can make in DM:N tribute solo runs.
---
It's 70-130g per hour. And it's relatively easy to learn.
---
Mages can't do that.
---
I don’t get it? You take res sickness when you care about wPvP?
---
Yeah it started out with only 1 Auction House in Ironforge and 1 Auction House in Orgrimmar. Then they added Auction Houses to the other cities (unlinked). Then after that they linked them all together.
---
Everyones reading shit data. 
---
Mouse over the graphs on the census reports and you'll see the numbers are complete guesses for last 7 days at best.
---
Those who wipe on Ony are just bad players (not whole raid but those who provoke the wipe). With the information and gear available, you can do Phase 1 raids in blues (not even Bis) if you use your brain and some addons which make it even easier
---
This simply is not true.
---
If you're using Precision you only need 2% hit to be capped in PvP, which you can get from Lionheart Helm (not a great option since no stamina but good stats before Crown of Destruction anyway) or Bloodmail Boots + Battleborn Armbraces / Blackstone Ring.
---
Pearl Harbor
---
Both ;)
---
No u.  Only alliance can be human garbage cause you can't pick human on horde.
---
Looking to make a PVP ally class because it's likely OCE bg queue times for horde will be awful. I have a horde rogue so don't want a rogue or warrior.  Really id love gameplay similar to elemental shaman - casting damage with utility. So I've got it down to Paladin, Warlock or Mage (dont like druids, not interested in a priest). My thoughts on each:
---
Paladin - Great group utility, I feel like therell always be a shortage of healers in BGs.  My 2 concerns is that they seem to really lack any offensive threat, and if you find yourself in a 1v1 out in the world you only win by surviving for a long time. The other concern is they are meant to be horrendous at levelling (i really just wanna get to 60 and pvp ASAP)
---
Warlock - Good pvp caster with some utility/peeling with CC, also healthstones.  Not many warlocks so easier to get groups n gear. My only concern is that nearly 50% of horde is undead, how much does WOTF screw you over as an alliance warlock?
---
Mage - similar to warlock in terms of good pvp caster with CC.  My concern with mages though is that they are overpopulated, not sure how bad it will make it to gear up or potentially find a premade.  The good thing about mages though is that horde racials don't affect you.
---
Any thoughts on my concerns would be helpful.  Thanks
---
&gt; A lot of raiding guilds don't upload raidlogs at all
---
These people are irrelevant, i think the only people who do this do like 2.5 hr MCs lol
---
Who's this now? I should join him...
---
Maybe check it out tonight it could be something similar! Our second raid team goes tonight and we’ll be escorting so we’ll see!
---
They’re ganking now, coz they know that on December 10 they will be left to the mercy of the gnomish master race :)
---
It makes them for all intents and purposes invisible to mobs. Yes, it will drop Aggro and combat for them. When they remove it, and are out of range for mobs, they will stay out of combat. 
---
Say a pat is coming, it will walk straight past the DI'd player.
---
"Even when you had the numbers" lmao. Again, there were thousands more horde online at every single hour. And whenever Horde actually faced any equal number fight they got wiped off the planet, which is why they quickly learned to just bring 2-3x the amount they'll be fighting.
---
I play feral. Our MT plays fury/prot and has the best gear in our raid. I out threat him even when he has aggro. It's not even close honestly.
---
Oh yeah, and I have about 20% more mitigation and much higher HP.
---
I'm not sure where you are getting your info from. Because in my experience you're just plain wrong.
---
No mining trainer too
---
can anyone form Momentum pm me the discord?
---
You got it ALL wrong.  Imma need about TREE FIDDY!
---
People aren't transfering off because they can't. The server is locked for alliance transfers, only horde can transfer away. And no, it's not Skeram levels of bad, but it is bad. My guildies have completely stopped running instances, especially in BRM since it takes 30 min of corpserunning to get to BRD/UBRS.
---
And i am in one of the guilds that very often roam around killing horde, and we have to constantly hopp zones and continents, if we linger for too long we get zerged by 3:1 numbers. And all guildies leveling alts in their 50's have pretty much given up on them. It's not being overly dramatic, it's the reality.
---
The way the camera is centered on the bank first and then is moved to the player right as he talks shit to take a fireball makes it all seem planned.
---
There's no way to know. On pservers stockpiling epics worked, but in classic blizzard might make them timestamped since in vanilla nobody knew nexus crystals were coming.
---
Doesn't hurt to save them just in case, if your enchanters have stash space.
---
It gives them contingency to delay for a few more days if necessary.
---
Humans have sword racial so it's silly not to use it (i think)
---
When i do the fade away execute crit on your horde budies it looks like the coolest shit ever.
---
I read this as "everybody of water" more times than I care to admit lol
---
To do the content you can really only do properly in a guild: organized raiding.
---
I will be honest, I hate tanking but I am willing to do it if the group lets me try as DPS and the dungeon itself is actually tankable like that. 
---
I ran ZF yesterday as dps tank. Only 1 person died during the boss which summons the giant lizards.. Other than that it was a flawless run with no wipes. (I am still salty on the healer pala rolling on the blue dps gloves and winning tho..).
---
I couldn't hold aggro very well but luckily there were 2 druids too and they helped out a tons. I am just now starting to regret a bit I haven't rolled one, they are pretty versatile. Well, maybe as an alt one day if I finish lvling to 60.
---
BGs in five days, we'll be fine.
---
Got the feeling Ten Storms EU is also balanced or in favor of allies.
---
Playing horde = WoW on easy mode. :p
---
I think your point of view is valid, but a bit different from the point that the OP is trying to make.   
---
You're not making good progress right now and would fall in the lowest brackets that the OP talkes about. But you are doing it deliberatly, you know you have more time pr week to rank once the ranking method of your choice, BG's, come out.   
---
I belive the OP is aiming the post more towards the casual players that with pushing as much ranking as they can in between raiding, gold farming and IRL commitment stil have not reached more then rank 3-4 at this point. And for them BG's wont change much. Yes, they will move from WPvP to BG's, but the time they have to invest in it will stil be the same that they invested into WPvP.
---
What the fuck
---
Did you consider using the Mechanical Yeti to deal with the adds?
---
Huh, I grinded there 2 lvls on my warrior cause the mobs are so easy.
---
Sure sounds like you're a pussy who rolled horde for the advantage in numbers. It's OK to admit you're bad at pvp.
---
Im not surprised tho.
---
It was just a matter of time until one of the big horde pvp servers will break down. Sucks for horde on flamelash but i think it gets inevitable at some point
---
Looks like you've put a lot of thoughts into it already.
---
I'd choose warlock given your requirements. WOTF only lasts 5sec and has 2min cd so its definietely not a game changer (even though powerful ability).
---
You can bind your mouse buttons to whatever keys you want.
---
You should not be salty about healers rolling on gear that helps them lvl.
---
In many cases being there for the raid is what the guild needs most, so not sure why that wouldnt count as helping the guild.
---
Sorry but I lost the roll on those gloves like 5 times now and I still got a crappy inferior green. It could help me level a lot too..
---
Just on Monday we cleared MC in a 35 people raid.
---
That included:
---
Me, an arms warrior who flatly refuses to wear non-plate
---
Two Ret-Palas among the DDs
---
Several people still wearing a green item (or even 2 or 3)
---
MC clear, all bosses down, no one cares that I am wearing the warrior T0 chest instead of SGC and even wore tue blue argent dawn signet as my second trinket which did #@! in MC and I may just as well have shown up with that slot empty.
---
Sorry, i'd rather watch 10 hours cat videos on YT than trying to farm BRD for a 6% chance of HoJ dropping which  I then have to roll for against 1-2 other melee DDs.
---
Once you get truefaith I'd drop tailoring for mining, DM jump runs are by far the best gold you can make as spriest.
---
+5 dmg is always better than crusader on mh
---
They really needed to address this from the start. I haven't really seen any home run solutions that don't limit peoples ability to play how they want though. It would have been interesting to see an outright ban on joining a server as a faction that is above 60% population of active players.
---
If you're ever on Earthshaker EU, I would happily level with you :)
---
Awesome edit. More so +1 for the Dune 2 Harkonnen quest giver 👍
---
This really depresses me.
---
I started out on Mograine horde (which seems fairly balanced) but switched to Noggenfogger alliance because my buddy played there. He obviously quit and now I'm stuck with a level 50 character there &amp; honestly impossible to level even though I adore this character and had good professions, fishing almost maxed, etc.
---
rolled a new Horde character on Mograine - level 14 undead warrior with no bags at all.
---
how do you even transfer?
---
13k is still a lot.  
---
Stonespine dropped down to ~8k
---
you horde are dirty little fucks, i was gonna farm some eye of shadow with my priest friend the other day and we saw a healer warrior farming as well and left them alone and waved while walking by. not 5min later they are 3 and jump us when farming a mob.
---
Click the "Shop" icon in the bottom left when you're on the character selection screen
---
how do you transfer?
---
These words are spoken by someone who never played a half naked leather warrior debuffed with Withering Heat and Cauterizing Flames while at 97% aggro in MC. There is nothing manlier than that.
---
Yeah, and a lot of people in these discussion say that you should be in the middle, be nice and try to help. They don't take in consideration how shitty people function, even when trying to help them, even when having a nice conversation with them they manage to victimize and make you look bad by saying something like "stop telling me what to do" or "let me play the game how I want". DUDE, IT'S A HELPING HAND, JUST ACCEPT IT.
---
thanks mate
---
Happened back in vanilla as well so there’s that
---
Even maintanking the current content as HotW is absolutely no problem.
---
I'm talking about you though.
---
It's 2019. Phones are in. Screenshots are too 90's.
---
I normally just cast corruption then shadowbolt/shadowburn, ill life tap 1-2 times then drink/eat whilst the tank gets the next lot of mobs. Bosses I put up COS/Corruption the SB/SB spam. You can use COA but fights for me rarely last the full 24 sec duration
---
You can pick dead human.
---
I am obviously referring to crits, as those are the big numbers people are reporting. I have spellpower gear in every slot plus a +30 spellpower skinning knife. It is only on some mobs i crit for 1200. Normal crit is around 1100. My LB damage ranges from 560 to 610 in that range. People underestimate just how ridiculously OP you can be if you use the tools available to you at like lvl 40-45. If you invest a little you can throw down some quite nasty numbers. I can take a SS of my gear and spellpower when i get home from work and send it to you.
---
How does one rank on a pve server if you don't mind me asking due to ss/tm (atleast on the pvp servers I know) giving about 0 honour as long as you're not a mage
---
Nahhh dude, you get downvoted for your shit logic bruh
---
Somewhere, someplace, there’s a guy fighting for legalization of public masturbation and he’s gonna use this story and squeeze it down to it’s last drip.
---
Thanks for the reply.  Yeah I am leaning towards warlock.  I just wonder if healers will be rare in bgs and if most pugs will greatly depend on which team has healers, in which case the pally would be really useful.
---
Is there any video of someone proccing HoJ/FlurryAxe/ThrashBlade/Sword-Spec simultaneously?
---
Hated that movie. No idea why everyone else seemed to love it so much.
---
Zandalar tribe it's 55 alliance 45 horde
---
I spent a disgusting amount of money on one so it'd be just my luck if they did
---
Couldn’t even answer the question. If there is zero good itemization for warriors in plate that is not applicable to the scenario I provided above is it?
---
I get hating tanking, but why level up a class that most people would want you to tank? If you hate it, just roll a rogue or another pure dps class.
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99995% sure that BrianMcKinnon is not a bot.
---
Friends.....?
---
Well I guess horde won on flamelash. It's actually pretty interesting to see how people react when a game doesnt hold their hand.
---
[http://darklegacycomics.com/85](http://darklegacycomics.com/85)
---
Interested to see a census from 19:00 server time, aka peak time.
---
laughs in queue timers
---
Unexpected rooster teeth
---
Probably yes, but pala is a chore to lvl (like you stated).
---
Can’t even answer the question. Even then it’s still 15 to 17. Still better to prioritize plate to the warrior, leather to the rogue.
---
That's forge, not anvil. You could smelt ores but not craft items.
---
Sometimes when you pop reck you have to act like you're that good :^)
---
You don't have any idea what I just said do you?
---
ngl warriors that refuse to tank are a pain, i'm starting to ask for a kick  if i'm invited on my warrior to tank a dungeon and another one is already in refusing to press his switch weapon macro.
---
&gt; every NPC in Silvermoon City will be lonelier. 
---
Every NPC in Exodar want to have a word with you.
---
Aren’t bg’s going to be cross server?
---
Well, crits are reasonable. But you said 
---
&gt; My lvl 52 shaman LB **hits** for 1200
---
OP talks about crits twice as high as yours, which also require 900-1000 Spelldmg to achieve.
---
"Community makes a move" - "booo thanks blizzard".
---
No matter what happens in wow classic, it's blizzard fault by default since they have created wow in the first place and there is a dedicated person who will kill you if you dare to unsub.
---
Wait, that’s illegal. What didn’t anyone call the police?
---
If you're not getting MC weapons then you'd be stuck with these weapons for a long time, so go ahead.
---
What I don't get is why is Blizzard not using a lot of persons we "know" for years for story impact?
---
There are so many little stories to be told... and so many characters. They really have the chance to give some of their characters to the storywriters and flesh them out.
---
Why is AV so much easier than WSG or AB?
---
Ah right, I dk but I heard people saying yes.
---
But are they across any servers or just between like 2 or 3 specific ones?
---
If there were population caps then people would have flipped out when only half of their guild could get on a server.
---
&gt; horde troll
---
As opposed to an Alliance troll
---
Yeah i think its ZG, not sure.
---
From my vast experience of playing WOW, I found out that only the gold DKP system (or Korean DKP) actually works in practice. 
---
* It allows you to sell PUG spots
---
*  it is fair to all (it eliminates favoritism)
---
*  encourages participation and is rewarding to all.
---
* it redistributes wealth among guild members.
---
And for fuck's sake, wow classic is just a free-to-play game. It's not like you have to pay monthly for it.
---
That's why you can server transfer.
---
its not the same as 2006, its so much worse. 
---
same world, but 3 or 4 times the playerbase on each server. so now instead of a couple of people camping FPs you have raids. you can "easily" organize to counter a few people, not so against an almost full raid if your faction is smaller. 
---
blizzard fucked up allowing so many people on each server due to fear of classic being a failure.
---
Stop getting baited so easily please.
---
Only if they’ve hit you with a blade a couple times.
---
Can you explain to me how they are "moving"? Do they transfer their chars? Or are they making new ones on a different server?
---
Cause both things are stupid at this time.
---
If they have their chars transfered they will pay money at the moment. Am I right? So Blizzard will welcome that income and think "Well: we did nothing wrong. This will give us some extra money. Let's keep everything as it is. Seems that it is working pretty good!"
---
If they are making new characters on a different server they will realize soon that the situation will change as soon as the BGs are released.
---
They might come back to the server and their time they spent on leveling some chars for a few days are just lost time...
---
And if you don't have the patience for a few days so wait for BGs... well maybe Retail is just for you and Classic is simple the wrong game?
---
Massive dickmove to any Alliance player that might be on vacation right now. Doing the transfer right before they close.
---
If you wanted to move, why couldnt you earlier?
---
Any Alliance player left there might aswell just delete the character.
---
I check things and do research from time to time. Sometimes I want to go on an adventure where I don't know the optimal strat. So yes, no, maybe.
---
Sure that won't ever get abused /s
---
Free character transfers have been open for over a month my dude...
---
Horde won most world pvp battles, but he's just being dramatic.
---
Some bots are extremely advanced, even using tech such as self learning AI. It's still a bit hard in a game like WoW, but in runescape there's fully functional self learning bots that are way better than the average player. Also, due to the nature of being self learning, as long as you keep them within a "human" reaction time, they literally can't get banned once they're good enough to pass as a player.
---
No
---
Maybe that's why he owned the T3 chars with only engi and trinkets as SL/SL....he was lev 70 fighting 60s.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have abused having a massively larger population.
---
Hopefully they'll close the transfers and let you have your dead PvE realm to yourself.
---
Just the way they made it. A dozen AVs at most. I don't remember exactly, but WSG takes like 1000 games +-250 and AB takes like 750 games +-250.
---
Yeah they're just way to many people on one server. That's the number one issue.
---
If you can afford it, I would say crusader is superior, but I personally wouldn't waste the gold on something that won't last you til 60 or beyond. At 40+ you'll be looking to replace it with something like the axe from rotgrip.
---
When the servers first started up there we too little due to the demand to play the game so a lot were created. 
---
Now, Blizzard have run into the issue that they didnt want of already dying servers. Not to mention the huge faction imbalances that most servers are facing.
---
I very much doubt that blizzard will actually leave this as it is, especially with the large amount of people quitting the game so I strongly believe that they will sort this out.
---
Whether this be through further free transfer as well as server merges, I reckon it will be sorted soon due to the huge distaste from the forums.
---
As a rogue i see everyone everywhere
---
/r/thathappened
---
Its only Blizzard to blame. 
---
Alliance does the same on Alliance dominated servers.
---
When an ele sham opens on someone, he uses EM which gives the appearances of someone disintegrating...which they do...but it has a 3min cd. I usually regard damage numbers referred by people as being edge cases, overly optimistic, best case scenarios or just overexaggerated massively, so I assumed he was referring to crits as did i. I am not entirely sure how you can reach those numbers as ele sham, as you do not get any external multipliers and have to rely on spellpower alone. Even with double proc trinket it seems impossible to reach currently. If ever?
---
it's funny becuase 59/41 is still a shitty imbalance, FL alliance side has been unplayable pretty much since phase 2 launched
---
By being the numerically superior faction and abusing that to corpse camp the entire world.
---
There is a vent/gripe flair for these posts.
---
And the alliance would have done it any differently if they had the majority of players? You expect people to NOT grind honor in world pvp when that’s the only way right now? ....
---
That is even worse. The patronizing /sorry from these alliance bastards as they farm you for the 7th hour in Hinterlands.. I'd just rather they /spit. Massive C-words.
---
Well then thats exactly what Blizzard wants... They want people to leave that server.
---
Working pretty well...
---
Yea, very unlikely
---
But i was thinking that a Rogue with Trash Blade in MH and Flurry in OH could swing OH, then immediatly sinister strike to swing MH, then you just pray that both Flurry/Trashblade/HoJ procs at the same time
---
Why/how would The bots hit trade and confirm?
---
They didn't win any battle. When things were within a slightly reasonable balance, they got smashed. They then returned with 2-3x the numbers and corpse camped
---
We are pretty much in the same situation, and so far i am mostly in favor of the normal DKP with a hidden bid system, highest bid wins the item. but it leaves room for improvement since it might discourage the more casual members from coming to raids.
---
Nucleus Pro (now known as the guilds Insurrection and Phoenix) both moved to Earthshaker too
---
lmao at the downvotes from all the salty prepubescent teenagers.
---
Uhh maybe because I like the dps role? I don't care what other people want and I don't force anyone into roles they don't want either. I was willing to tank because no matter where I went it was ganked by 60 horde (even ZF entrance at freaking 22 PM!). It was the only way to get some xp.
---
how are you still breathing?
---
And Blizzard if you do make sure you have a good supply of size XXXXL for the ones that use to be in shape 15 years ago but after playing this game for many years no longer are.
---
If you are level 60, then you cant o wrong with Winterspring or  EPL, flag up and look for 1v1 fights.  Emote players to fight.
---
All aboard the mass hysteria train...
---
Server is taking a hit as a PvP server yes, but  
---
Crossrealm BG's are releasing  
---
You think blizzard aint gonna start merging faction unbalanced pvp realms?  
---
Official vanilla had server transfers, they will come back come back as free or paid in the near future.  
---
IMO, I wouldnt transfer if you are well established in a guild or with a group of friends.
---
If you are ally GET OUT! What was unplayable will now be truly hopeless.
---
You justifying your sociopathic sadistic tendencies by "it being part of the game" is getting a little old.
---
What do you mean by fucked? They won the faction war! They should be feasting! They can happily retire and relax playing farming simulator and whatnot!
---
Well most of your damage at that level comes from Sinister Strikes. And thats the reason you want sword in your MH to buff that damage up. Dagger on OF ofc so poisons proc more often. 
---
You can go for double dagger for Ambush sure but you will lose overall damage on that. Dagger build on that level is more of a meme build to oneshot non-twinkers. But if you fight against other twinks your Ambush doesent kill them even closely and then you lack the damage to finish them off. 
---
Sword just puts more pressure on enemys. If you have a twink guild and your BG team has another rogue you can talk with him and make a deal that other is dagger rogue who does Ambush openings.
---
 All aboard the mass hysteria train...
---
Official vanilla had server transfers, they will come back come back as free or paid in the near future.
---
Back in BC we had this 39 ally warr twink in our group that was so proud of WWing on the GY in BGs. He even bragged about it. Wasn't a great twink tho, like 7/10 gear.
---
We were ally too, but we hated his guts. So we collaborated. One of my all time favorite WoW moments was laughing with my horde (and ally) buds as they camped his ass and we let the non twinks carry out the WSG as usual.
---
If you are using the hamstring method then damage per hit is what matters, not damage per second.
---
What about that level 5 NE hunter fishing off the coast of Barrens all day?
---
We use EPGP, which is essentially an AI controlled loot council.
---
There's ALMOST no chance it's better than demonshear if you're arms, sword spec is very good.  You should just go hit mobs for a while to see how often it procs though, I doubt there are many people using this weapon in classic.  AV is just around the corner, you'll be able to get an Unstoppable Force soon enough.
---
SS/TM gives tonnes of honor, as long as you are grouped up. I am on a PVE server and got over 4K Honor last week, yet only PvP'd for about 2hrs on Fri and 2hrs on Sunday. 
---
I've seen there are lots of folk getting lots of HKs and ranking up to Stone Guard this week (Rank 6).
---
 Harbinger of Doom /  Rhok'delar /  Wyrmthalak  are waiting for you.
---
Stay. You made your bed, lie in it and enjoy never setting foot in AQ.
---
Your "scenario" is such a ridiculous straw man it's not worth "answering". Of course plate itemization matters to that scenario. Why would the plate be wasted? It just goes to another warrior or a tank. It's not a raid of 1 rogue and 1 warrior.
---
Items should be prioritized based on BiS and many BiS items for fury warriors (the best PVE DPS in classic btw) are simply not plate in this phase.
---
Don’t feel weird asking mages, I always hand out free water when I’m in a capitol city. 
---
Sometimes people tip me as well, but I never ask for it.
---
Bonebiter is very good and could probably work all the way up to 60
---
I personally go for DW around lvl 50-52, just for a change of pace
---
Griefing the fuck out of everyone they see, maybe?
---
Camping people just trying to level, or get to dungeons. In general, making playing the game a truly miserable experience for the other side. 
---
If you see what's going on, see the other side having to die a dozen plus times to get to BRD, know it takes them close to an hour... and think: I wouldn't like that, I wouldn't want to play like that... but still keep doing it... that's how you help create this situation. This desire for those people to BE GONE.
---
Blizzard is most to blame, of course. But if I had a population advantage, I wouldn't be putting the minority through that because I just dont have it in me to make life hell for people.
---
*It's a biological attack, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah*
---
How about in the next edition you include how several members of your guild are wintrading for honor?
---
jesus christ stop acting like a victim
---
So deep
---
&gt; Compare that to a 1750 hand of rag crit, a HOJ proc that crits, an MS and a WW, which can be done in 2 globals. Or a ret paladin with a Hand of Rag crit, SoC crit, judgment crit, HOJ proc all within a hammer of justice
---
hand of ran is only gonna do 1750 w/ mortal strike, with enrage up, crusader procced, group buffs, on lvl 50 clothie w/ no armor buffs up like inner fire.... and that warrior generates 0 rage on hits on any type of barrier, and that mage frost armor gives you a 4.6 seconds swing timer... and youll be rooted or slowed beyond 50% the entire time
---
meanwhile casters can in 2.5 seconds + a instant at the end do far more dmg... pretty consistently.... from range
---
the ideal BG team is gonna be 3 healers, maybe 1 mortal strike, then all locks/mages/hunters with maybe some rogues tossed in. Ele shamans for horde. The more casters the better. They are the hardest to kill because of things like iceblock providing up to 20 seconds of immunity when your short 10min reset is up, lots of CC (like, 40 sec polymorph is just stupid), roots galore, gears, etc, and far more nuking power than even the best geared warrior or other 2h melee can dish out.
---
What a beautiful dog you have! I love dwarf snouts.
---
Mine passed away some years ago. RIP Henry
---
I don't play on Flamelash, because like every other player, I transferred.
---
Couldnt see through that manky UI jesus....
---
In Vanilla I was in a battlegroup with PVP/PVE/RP servers -  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Trollbane\_Europe](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Trollbane_Europe). 
---
I doubt we'll have queues as alliance/horde ratio is 51-49.
---
I admire your and your group's stoic calm in that ninja loot situation.
---
Very civilized.
---
I usually get really tempered, but this story actually kinda inspired me to try to be more stoic and just have a laugh.
---
Gnomosh Cloaking Device no longer works for Onyxia threat :(
---
&gt; I was surrounded by about 20 alliance who stood doing full raid buffs on everyone before they finally felt courageous enough to attack me by myself with my fishing gear on.
---
sounds like a legit story that totally happened
---
Camping people with 10x the number isn't winning a battle, it's just being a cunt. Flamelash horde are garbage pvpers, as you'd see anytime there was a 1v1 or 1v2.
---
Right but what's wrong with rolling a rogue, mage, hunter, or warlock instead? I'm not trying to be rude or anything, just curious. 
---
I can't imagine getting into groups as a dps war is easy either. I don't know about others but I leave groups if they have 2 wars, I'm greedy and want both tank+dps gear.
---
Every pvp server you to to will function exactly like you’re complaining about. If you don’t want to roll on a pve server the maybe play a different game.
---
No, if you set the mouse button as the secondary keybind or bind the mouse button to that number key outside wow. For example, some mouse software allows you to bind it so that when you press the mouse button, it actually presses number 8 on the keyboard instead.
---
BGs will be cross server and if they're like Classic there'll be a mix of PVP/PVE servers - either in one large group or split into population-balanced battlegroups. I'm really not worried about queue timers at all.
---
Doesn't change the 24/7 corpsecamping you took part in.
---
Enjoy never getting to open the AQ gates.
---
But when you get there is awesome and worth it :D
---
nah its just kinda assumed that a person who has NEVER played call of duty before wouldn't start by buying the original call of duty..
---
Oh no problem, reading it back I might have come across as a dick,  my apologies.  It just seems crazy to even consider it in Ony,  but I would guess it most likely does; I'm guessing it clears you entirely from the combat log.  Speculation of course.
---
That should offer a good compromise. If you find a healer with herb/enchanting (I had herb/skinning before and just dropped skinning for enchanting) you could just split all the income evenly. I'm sure many healers would be happy to team up, since gold farming is not that easy, aside from open world herbing or farming DM:E lashers if you're a priest. Druids might be able to join some tribute stealth runs, I suppose - but you get the picture. It's good gold for both of you, if you can make up a decent duo.
---
Problem is why tank for warrior dps? They roll on the same items but tanking is a harder job.
---
Especially your situation 3 people rolling on the same item I much rather find a group with some mages and hunters and get any gear I need.
---
I prefer the RPG/lore feel of a Paladin wearing what a Paladin should wear.
---
Funny, we made a decision and moved days after transfers opened from Firemaw horde to Earthshaker. Sooo....?
---
if you have zero armor buffs, are in blue/green gear, arent lvl 60, and a fully buffed, crusader procced warrior w/ hand of rag comes at you... you might see a 1300 whirlwind.....
---
meanwhile mages out there every 2.5 seconds dishing out over 3.5k dmg at the end of the cast consistently from range, but being almost impossible to kill as frost and having insane amounts of CC that dont properly DR
---
AP is actually inflating PVE stats
---
i.e. rogues and fury warriors get massive AP from world buffs, and then often get out dpsd by mages and stuff after molten core when they get off frost spec.... with no spell power buffs. And frost is already right behind and very close... without being inflated by AP world buffs
---
soooo, by default, they actually do quite a bit more DPS just due to how insane spell power scales
---
ES is what? Oh...one of those that doesnt want more people on ES.
---
Yes, ES is a dead server, stay away.
---
I'm pretty confidant this doesn't work with druid's Entangling Roots. I like to 'guard' low-level roads. I'll root them and then emote a bunch, pointing at them then the direction they were going, and shaking my head no. I'll use /wait, /point, /nod, /shake, /threaten, and /shoo and I haven't had this bug yet.
---
I don’t even think you can cast with that shot on!
---
Invite the tank warrior, say sorry to the DPS warriors and kick them, find 2 other non-warrior dps who will join the group in seconds.
---
Currently using Tuk UI which have been working out fine for me, but ive noticed that the "out of range" fader in party / raid groups is set to less then what i can reach with my heals (40 yards). Couldnt find any options to change the range of this. Any ideas?
---
People would think you’re part of a cult/freak/mass shooter, would not recommend
---
Too literal, happens to someone every week :D
---
Yeah, I was just wondering if it was finished in any future expansions. BLZ has a habit to recycle scraped contents in the past. So I see, it was developed into a DOTA like BG in Pandaria? Hmm, good to know, thanks.
---
Yes, that's the proper attitude.
---
Its probably for raiding, one would be Dps the other would be threat so you dont pass the tanks
---
No I don't agree:
---
From your definition of group 4, almost every player on the low populated faction fits group 4: for exemple if there's 10'000 players on a server with 60-40, then there's 4000 players who hate current PvP.
---
Then in the dominating faction we have 6000 players but how many are fitting your definition of group 3? for example from census site, we get that roughly 40-50% of the player are yet 60 and therefore not really making death squad and camping flypath but principally trying to level. Which leaves us with only 3000 players.  Then on this population of lvl60 on the dominant faction, how many are really PvPing seriously? judging from the rankin I see in game, I'd say that only a few hundreds are taking things seriously (that's what I meant with my unclear number) so:
---
* 40% people on the low populated faction who hates current state of PvP (group 4)
---
* 50% people on the majority faction who don't participate either because don't have the level, not caring or don't find it particularly fun (group 2)
---
* 10% people (at most probably less) fit your definition of group 3
---
I don't see where you see a majority: from my point of view there's a very small (5-10%) but very active number of PvPer on each server who are farming and making the state of PvP absurd for way bigger numbers. And even more, I don't think they are even having that much fun for exemple a comment I read this morning:
---
&gt;I got rank 3 the first week by rolling around in a 5-10 man death squads just being a trash bag and farming people otherwise not looking for fights. I'd say 80% of my "honourable" kills weren't even close honourable. Needless to say the novelty wore off very quickly. And since that first reset I've pretty much avoided playing this game, because either you're the trash bag or you're the trash bags food. Neither are something I would be willing to commit to for the amount of time it takes to make any kind of serious progress.
---
No it's called an undead, which is the same thing. If the dead are rising from the graveyard. You woulnd't call em dead humans. So yeah horde is human garbage.
---
I'm fury and went prot at 60 to gear up. Luck will turn around I'm sure. HoJ from BRD and 2h sword from strat live would be good if you can get them for PvP I if you find a willing shaman
---
Being Fury Warrior you got a the Unbridled Wrath talent which has a 40% chance to generate 1 additional rage per hit. That's the only difference I can think of before hitting rage cap. But I still think you should be able to deal more damage than him because your weapons are superior and slower MH benefits whirlwind damage at least a bit. So there's probably some difference in gearing (compare your hit, crit and ap) or rotation.
---
Im vanilla when a realm gets merged people need to rename their chars if their are duplicate names after a merge
---
&gt;Enjoy never getting to open the AQ gates.
---
Your other obvious and blunt comment aside - if one faction is particularly inactive with the War efforts for AQ, the gates will auto-open at a later stage. 
---
Are you one of the allies who migrated from Flamelash, or why the salt and malice?
---
That's not a problem to dps as a warrior especially warriors are best dps later on, just don't act surprised with other warriors refuse to tank for you.
---
What about my time, dumb dumb?
---
What is the problem exactly for Horde?
---
BGs are cross-realm, so it does not affect the ranking capabilities of Horde or Alliance players whatsoever. In fact, it makes it easier to hit higher ranks on empty servers. 
---
As long as the population is high enough for raiding guilds to exist, thats all that matters.
---
cool
---
When Classic launched, due to the long queue times, everyone was saying, "Omg Blizzard you have done this before, you should know you need more servers! These queues are unacceptable for a company with your experience." So Blizzard opened more servers, and now players are experiencing the effects of what they asked for.
---
They though that the sight of a female officer in uniform may have only encouraged him more.
---
The wiki says it was the one left out, aka out of the three BGs they were considering, they added the other two and scrapped the Azshara one. It was definitely not a thing in MOP.
---
Come on you're just trying to get someone gullible to pay for your sub. Getouttahere
---
&gt;They have no semblance of coordination. Their rules are poorly thought up and poorly enforced. It makes no god damned sense.
---
Agree which is why I applied in the first place. I had several posts removed for arbitrary reasons, the breaking point being "it doesn't relate to classic because stealth is in retail too"
---
&gt;The problem is, with these larger subreddits, they often time get taken over by "power mods" such as /u/Vusys/
---
, /u/ZeldenGM/
---
First time I've been called that. The only other large-ish subreddit I moderate it /r/eve which has a tiny report queue, a very open ruleset to reflect the game-attitude, and very little modmail containing mostly queries.
---
&gt;where they have so much modmail and so many submissions to go through that it would be physically impossible to view them all or apply the rules correctly as you're bouncing from sub to sub, and unless you have the rulesheet open for each individual subreddit
---
My modqueue is 99% classicwow, and pretty much everything posted in /r/eve is an approve unless it breaks site rules. The only ruleset I have to look at is the classicwow one, which I continue to push for change because rules on things like memes are ridiculous, there's no set-rule for self-promotion but it's enforced because reddit rules, and some of the automod flags are insane.
---
The reality of the situation is we have something like 30 mods, 6 of which are active. Only one of the "admin" are active currently. We have lots of mods that dip in to just remove posts, not leave comments, etc.
---
I agree, of all the subs I've worked in, this one is the worst. However I'm sticking it out and will continue pushing for changes in the mod discord. My other option is to walk away and just leave the sub to continue as it is, albeit with 18% less moderator activity.
---
You need exalted to buy it regardless
---
You dont, but lots of others do.
---
It was the same with Alliance on Zandalar Tribe, they camped BRM 24/7 and as a Horde you had to corpserun for an hour to get anywhere. 
---
This really doesnt have anything to do with Horde or Alliance sides. It's just people who have the advantage will also use the advantage to grief, because it is unlikely they will get punished.
---
I'm no programmer, but certainly a few "If \_\_\_, then \_\_\_" would at least allow it to auto-attack a mob rather than stand there until it died. I'm not talking about complex fighting decisions, I'm talking about "If unable to cast \_\_\_, /startattack until sufficient mana to cast \_\_\_, then cast \_\_\_". Is it truly that complicated to program?
---
How do you know that "almost noone uses the addon?"
---
It takes one relative active player per server and faction to get fairly good data.
---
You know you can enter mc by swimming in the lava?
---
We need proof. There's tons of people doing this and it's not RMT.
---
Grid2 is excellent and can be customized to show pretty much everything; mine are keeping track of relevant raid debuffs, magic debuffs, poisons, diseases, curses and magic effects, and I've set them up to show when someone has Ancestral Healing (+%armor buff) on them - so I suppose you could set it up to show your buffs too if you wanted. 
---
Out of range fader is activated by default and you can adjust the distance. There's also a website (murlocparliament) with guides on how to change basically anything you can think of unit frame-wise.
---
Good logic there bud
---
I went there in MOP prepatch to see if I could solo that place on my DK, only to have an entire horde raid come out of nowhere (for the record, DKs could totally solo city bosses in that patch, I got baine to like 70% before someone noticed).
---
Youre an Alliance player so you being a pleb is understandable and OK.. Warriors are sht at pvp untill we get trinkets. Which is now. So... And the only reason warriors are somewaht decent in BG's is cuz theyre so bad no one focuses them. This guy is running around with OEB and multiple other big pieces, and used reck. This is not OP at all, if anything im surprised he didnt do more damage´.
---
You've never known war or danger ganking 20 Vs 1. Why you think the alliance left your server.
---
Yeah me too. I'm following my buddy Hue.
---
I put crusader on mine.
---
I personally wish I stuck with firey and just mashed hamstring for procs on fiery / overpower but it's not bad. Crushes the SM instances for sure
---
If all you care about for a mount is the gold expenditure, yeah. There is only one AV mount, no different colours etc.
---
I think you should go play eve online and get some thicker skin. You got scammed, boho. Don't get scammed next time. Live and learn.
---
Your first mistake is using a shield if threat is your goal :)

---
Also, what enchants would you recommend on MH and OH?
---
Yeah, cause you only pay a subscription if you play 8 hours per day and raid? 
---
What a mindless comment.
---
Not every country is fucked up.
---
Funny thing about the horde.
---
If they are the same level as you? They watch you and call their friends to help kill you.
---
If they are five levels higher than you? They kill you, and call their friends to camp your corpse and the graveyard.
---
If they are level 60? They camp you, the town you want to quest in, and the nearest graveyard.
---
And no, I don't play on a pvp server. This is purely from my memory of a pvp server way back in vanilla, and was a major driver in why I picked a pve server this time. But I can count on one hand the number of times a horde engaged me in a fair fight (which I define as + or - 2 levels, even numbers). And damn was it fun when they did.
---
For some that dont immediately recognise it, what armour set is this?
---
Well there are a ton of people who dont enjoy raid vs raid, because its just a massive lag fest. 
---
They basically lose nothing and gain an easy PvE server for themselves. We saw the influx of people who regret rolling on a PvP server once Phase 2 hit.
---
damn that's some expensive trash.
---
The quest is called "In Dreams", so...
---
It still costs hundreds of gold.  Marks for rewards isn’t a thing until the honor system revamp.
---
As a warlock you have a pretty good ability to farm gold either in mara or dm east solo jump runs so I’d say go for it if you don’t think you’ll be getting a weapon any time soon. Probably just depends on how much you personally value 30 sp vs gold.
---
Does it works if you /wave at yourself?
---
Are you saying I’m wrong, and downvote me for it? Cause I’m not wrong that’s exactly what would happen also what country are you talking about you don’t even know where I’m from but I’m assuming you’re talking about USA, in which case why you mad at America
---
Why aren't you gathering people up and ganking this dude over and over? Give him some of his own medicine.
---
Unless it's a PVE server ofc and he doesn't get flagged for killing an npc from the other faction.
---
I have some abilities bound as 7,8 etc but never use those buttons. I have secondary binds which I use but since they’re not primary they don’t show on the actionbar. 
---
So it’s not certain he has to press 8 for shield slam.
---
Theoretically, the rich raiders will enrich the poor raiders by purchasing items in the raid, but in practice, the rich will continue to get richer, since they got rich in the first place, and while the poor will get gold, and that's nice, they will still not be able to compete with the rich for gear.
---
Even bless online had some sort of balancing in place.
---
This pleases me
---
I distinctly remember my Priest shitting all over them. Glimmering Mithril Insignia + Shadow Reflector really didnt make life easy for them.
---
Fortunately, you can keep it while stealthed, and Taelan/Tirion do it themselves anyway.
---
I never downvote.
---
Yes but that has nothing to do with Alliance transferring off the server. 
---
The queue times would be the same with our without Alliance on their server.
---
Bloodfang isn't. Earthshaker might be for another day until all the horde flamelash guilds transfer. 
---
Epic though, ur proposal to fix servers with heavy imbalance is to merge them with the server all the allies came from. That's some 200 IQ shit right there. 
---
FYI you don't fix a 80% horde medium pop server by merging it with a 51% alliance med pop server.
---
More possibilities to get rep.  
---
All quests, objectives, turn-ins.
---
Sacrifice, Sacrifice, oh shit Garr minion resisted banish
---
Start using the tools, it doesn't matter who had most level 10 characters at some point in the game. 
---
Apply filters for level 60 and seen in the last week and you get more realistic view.
---
Thanks man sounds promising! ill check it out

Then what country are you even talking about lol wtf?
---
Horde is responsible for this mess and horde should stay and reap what they've sown. I would petition to disable horde transfers off Flamelash.
---
Crown of destruction is better than LH if you min/max gear
---
So, I have to admit to being skeptical as to how an AI could adequately perform what a loot council should do (prioritize loot to those raiders who could make best use of it, thus enriching the raid as a whole as much as possible).
---
How about you give me (us) a quick-n-dirty explanation of EPGP, so we have some idea on how it works?
---
I don't know why I laughed at this
---
The problem is too many view compassion as weakness.
---
9/10 when I spare someone grinding they then jump me when I am farming.
---
This server was one of the biggest on EU, that's ironically why it's failing.
---
This is on Gehennas and this dude was camping IF for like 7-8 hours.
---
Is there any experienced redditor who can explain what NSFW tag is doing here?
---
Got it last night! And yeah, the Eye of Shadow was pricey. managed to get it for 300g on a bid only listing at 2am. Quest was tricky, but did manage it first time :)
---
Literally everyone who's not braindead knows warriors are OP as fuck in vanilla, it's no secret.
---
For PVP, there are certain basics such as: 
---
\- "Right" spec - Which boils down to not trying to PvP in a PvE spec for many classes, or at least grab the "key" PvP talents for your class. 
---
\- "Right gear" - Which means get more stamina. For instance, Warrior pre-raid BIS has no stam and a ton of leather gear. 
---
The rest is knowing what you need to do within a certain degree, the rest is experience.
---
100% outplay totally not a bug
---
I’d personally go for Agility enchant on both weapons. 30 extra agi is quite nice. But Im not expert on 29 twinks so you might want to research more on that topic! 
---
Good luck and may the crits be with you!
---
CCing someone isn’t waiting it out though.
---
You see, your point implies ganked people actually exceed the gankers in sheer numbers, which means, by itself, ganked people are actually able to organize and chase the gankers away and control the area/hub/dungeon entrance. It implies gankers are able to do what they do simply because they are better in quality. not quantity: better organized, more dedicated. Which is, again, stripes the complainers of any literal right go complain. And that's the point any complainer is going to refuse.
---
Let me express your point in more typical pvp-manner (which I do not share myself) while keeping the initial idea intact:
---
lol cry me a river, I guess it's too hard for a carebear like you actually to make some other group and pvp on pvp server? you all scrubs just sitting in your capital allowing us freely to farm you like a livestock despite the fact you exceed us in numbers? Hahaha tuck your tail and complain more you pve scrub should have rolled pve server in the first place if you don't want to pvp or go back to retail. 
---
Try to explain your point of "you aren't overwhelmed by numbers, you are just owned by a small bunch of pvp-ers who are able to own you because you can't organize and fight back, all you can do is complain here" to any of the complainers. I am sure they are going to disagree.
---
It wasn't 65-35 even last week. Last week was like 62-38 no matter if you are basing on ironforge or census. 
---
And earthshaker is showing 61-39 is virtually same but in the opposite direction.
---
Just google ironforge or census and apply filters for last 7-14 days and level 55+ and see for yourself.
---
Just no..u want blizz to force allies to play with u.. u laid the bed and now u gotta sleep in it
---
You expect new comer to fix your own mistakes ?
---
Playing Ally is trash on most server atm, so I wouldn't advise to pick this side if he wants a pvp server.
---
&gt;I've never seen someone actually say it because they genuinely believe there should be no changes.
---
Where the fuck were you before classic's launch?
---
Thank you. Will check those options.
---
Hi, /u/warrior4206969

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e6g4t6/will_the_iced_barbed_spear_be_coming_with_launch/). 
---
Ahh it's amazing how true some of these insights are for most industries. Value your employees, consider criticism as an opportunity to improve and don't be driven by making money but by making something amazing in its own right
---
I don't' think so, I just remember your name and seeing you around. I was a hunter called 'lookatmypet'. Terrible name. 
---
I did try to find my old guild but was such a long time ago, no idea where they ended up. Guild was 'Phoenix rising' before everyone left the server.
---
ok boomer
---
but 1death +preraid ?
---
What do you do on server which are 80% horde? Make 3/4 of the faction queue so they can be equal to a tiny alliance pop?
---
That might work on 55/45 split server but once it gets 60/40 or worse it's impossible to fix.
---
It is a PVE server however people have done exactly as you have suggested and he just keeps comming back.
---
&gt; Got my level 35 Mage to Grunt
---
What? Doesn't Grunt/Scout just require 1 HK?
---
In PvE spinal reaper is better (on bosses that have the correct armour debuffs) due to the weapon skill racial. In PvP the BRE is better as weapon skill has no effect in PvP. Also DB will produce more dps on single target.
---
Yeah, there is a hunter going after the shellfish traps in Desolace 24/7 for about two months now on my server. I've added him as a friend on a few characters so I can watch him. I need to level up my druid so I can start trying to mess them up.
---
What does that have to do with WoW?
---
If this is your first leveling experience you may not know that after level 40 quests tend to give you a lot more gold so in the end you get it a level or two past 40 if you are savvy! 
---
That being said you can try and farm whelps top right and bottom right of badlands for decent greys to sell and small flame sacs for AH. I did this at launch and sold for a pretty penny while getting a good couple levels in! But it’s relative to your servers AH prices! 
---
Good luck bud happy playing :D
---
&gt; Flamelash horde are garbage pvpers, as you'd see anytime there was a 1v1 or 1v2.
---
I haven't seen a single instance of world PvP outside of world bosses where either side was interested in those scenarios, both the Alliance and Horde are spamming groups/raids to farm honor. The difference is that the Horde outnumbers the Alliance mostly so the Allies think it's super different.
---
As a solo player on a mostly Horde server I can tell you I also die a shitton just trying to get to dungeons, Alliance gankers don't care one bit either.
---
So I have you to thank for my countless hours of fun in LoL! Seems like an interesting book to give to my brother (who hopes to become a game dev himself)
---
Really?  Because I've done that so much before?
---
It's a fucking video game, children.  It's not that goddamn important you complete an escort quest.
---
Yup. That's it! 
---
Thanks friend.
---
I gave 'em a dolla
---
Mage or Warlock for gold farming?
---
as someone with a gnome mage, i understand, carry on
---
My servers sound now we got an influx of your ally cos you ruined your server. I'm alliance.
---
I deserved a good server and got it, you're right x
---
Why should people willingly choose a worse experience over a better one in a game they paid for?
---
Have you seen Smallhands? Dude is on every time I go to IF. This is all he does all day.
---
As I understand it they positioned the entrance to be closer to the bank.  This happened after Cat\*?  Im unsure of the when, and have never personally seen it, but it moved supposedly.
---
I remember both your name and your guild! Would have been fun if all the old kor'gall people played together :(
---
Nope. When there's always 2-3k more horde online, you're literally fucked no matter what. Go PvP somewhere, crush them and you still have to run for your life because three raids will immediately be zoning in on your position.
---
Well there's two issues. Some servers are incredibly imbalanced but also there's way way way too many people on most servers.
---
Hahahahahaha *laughs in pve*
---
Alliance Heartseeker here, i'm also praying for you bud
---
This post sounds like alliance gibberish.
---
Just wanted to followup that I've confirmed the problem is caused by Deja Classic Stats.
---
He's talking about the country you're describing ya dingus
---
I made the personal choice to use Bracket 14 as the top bracket. Why? Because it makes more sense.
---
I've heard rogues skillcap reduces alot after bwl. 
---
My rogue is fully geared, and I'm about to lvl an alt.. what class shines very well in p3-p5? 
---
Thinking about druid, hunter or warlock. Mostly hunter. How are they doing pvp wise in later phases?
---
Well i don't think victory has a special meaning in video game.
---
Source: https://i.redd.it/uyba5omuer241.jpg
---
Yeah of course. The news are everywhere. Even the medium sized raid guilds have transferred off. Horde basically has the choice between following to a more healthy server or staying on a completely dead realm. 
---
The choice seems easy to me.
---
lmfaooooooooooo
---
Just wanted to followup that I've confirmed the problem is caused by Deja Classic Stats. It's been over two weeks without using that one specific addon and I've not experienced that bug again. Thank you!
---
Wow
---
&gt;As soon as my alt hit lvl 48, it became almost impossible to level in the open world
---
It depends on the server but on Bloodfang you can level but only it quiet zones like Felwood, Ungoro, Silithus, Deadwind Pass.
---
Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge are unplayable 24 hours a day.
---
If your horde farm in searing gorge
---
We met up with 2 other guilds to go to brm tuesday. 160 horde waiting for us at the south entrance and 30 rogues with sappers waiting at the bottom of the ramp to collapse on us....
---
This comment right here is so fitting.  Explains it all
---
If one is serious about pvp and rep for wsg I'd expect them to do premades for a good bit. This should increase your winrate substantially.
---
Still I think you got a point that it is a big grind. Positive is that you don't lose progress as you would do with rank grinding
---
I actually have not looked around very much for that, I just wanted some mana bars to be able to judge when to pop Mana Tide in my group and to gauge overall healer mana - for the latter, only seeing healers would arguably be easier, but raiding with a stable team every week I know which are the "important" ones to look at.
---
I've seen people ask the same question as you though, so I imagine that it's either a bit hidden or confined to later versions. I assume you've been through the murlocparliament website already?
---
You're right it wasn't 65-35 last week. It was 70/30 and progressed to 85/25 and 80/20 throughout the week.
---
Everyone knows census is shite, and ironforge displays the part of the population that raids in guilds okay, but doesn't take anything else into account.
---
90g hr omegalul
---
What's official about you claiming that?
---
40% is fine, we got that on our server and it's not too bad.  
---
The issue is now aftertransfers it's way less then 40% and now it might become an issue for PvE at some point, well we'll see.   
---
Down to Rank2k in PvP with 15kills a week though.
---
Honor title prestige were high in vanilla, but now they're worthless since only title people remotely care about are arena titles and some server first bosses achieve
---
No ”fucking furries” comments? Disappointed...
---
If you can play that much, just make alts imo. It'll be more useful and better since you'll gain knowledge about other classes and how they play in pvp.
---
Yeah. And burning steps (-;
---
Sorry misworded the question, which should I enchant?
---
Especially if said victory earned the victors a one-sided server.
---
 so deep put her ass to sleep
---
yes please. literally just a screenshot of someone dead...
---
Jeez, what do arcanite bars go for then?
---
If the ratio is something like 90/10 H/A then I think that servers like this should be made a PvE server until they figure it out. 90/10 is not what people signed up for
---
Yeah, it should be pretty easy to do. Just click a button. But nothing happens.
---
Sorry bad wording on my part, I meant which should I enchant?
---
I never said what country in my first comment ya Dingus
---
It doesn't really matter which order you do, but ranking 14 as the top bracket is the most common (e.g. in honorspy).
---
He gets business from my Darnassus bank alt. He is like my private broker. And you have a great view from this place too.
---
I've been looking for a bath robe...
---
Except a noob can attend raids get dkp and buy the rare valuable items. With LC shitters can be excluded more.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4701_Mograine
---
And that server is pretty accurate ..no way its 60 % horde dominated how many alliance are crawling around
---
Alt tab and just search it you snowflake, it's even faster then asking
---
Thats it, i quit! The game is literally unplayable.
---
Everyone gets an upvote.
---
Im talking just to get inside BRM, but there’s also horde jumping after people in lava.
---
This is basically the exact description of Stalagg Horde
---
Oh I read 20 agi per crit. My sources must be wrong
---
It's also about the high end damage on Stoneslayer / Rockpounder. As a leveling arms warrior you don't have a lot of offensive abilities until you get MS. 
---
Having Stoneslayer (with 5% sword proc) and sweeping strikes, you can take down 3 mobs at a time incredibly fast, or you can do 75% dmg of a mob in 1 second. It's not so much about your dps, but more your burst potential.
---
Ok that's a fair point. I still think that the fix should have been faction based queues and transfers instead of lowering the max capacity.
---
You are doing gods work!
---
Keep up the killing spree.🤣
---
I got this haircut in purple and I love it
---
Druids should be beating warriors 1v1 too.
---
 Lol 
---
* goes person mode to heal up*
---
*gets 1 shot because leather, no shield, and low health*
---
Indeed I remember in Vanilla that when we saw the first rank 14 it was like seeing a star.
---
At the end of Vanilla it was: "another nolife who probably shared account"
---
Nobody can see your downvotes, this sub hides them. He's saying that you described **your** country as fucked up but the original person who you responded to might not have that problem.
---
It basically is by that point anyway, no world PvP to happen
---
If the "unhappy" people from group 4 exceed in numbers the other "happy" people from group 3, they should be able to turn the tide over and establish their presence in important areas. 
---
&gt;and the group of people in Menethil just disband because it's been 10 minutes since they last saw them
---
How come the group for your first example ganks for 8 hours and the second group disbands after 10 minutes? 
---
&gt;As soon as the group disband, the situation is back to normal.
---
Applies to the very same situation of 5 ppl camping flight path. As soon as they disband, the situation is back to normal. However, they don't disband and I don't see why these people who brought 4 raids to BRM should disband either. 
---
&gt;My point is that you can gather and win a battle once but it's ultimately useless because they will come back.
---
If you are able to gather and chase gankers away then you should be able to prevent them coming back as well.
---
If you’re horde I strongly recommend the turtels right outside the Hinterlands camp. Easy to kite and farm and the vendor loot isn’t half bad. It’s also relatively close to brm.
---
Bracket 1 as the top is what the meajrioty of the high rankers use. You can here a lot of them complain about honorspy getting it backwards.
---
It resets aggro completely, taking the recipient out of combat, removing all damaging effects, and making them immune to all damage and healing, at the cost of the paladin who cast it. The recipient cannot take any actions including movement until they cancel the buff or it runs out.
---
Source: 15 years of paladin. God I miss that spell.
---
It's best use is wipe prevention, but you can rarely cheese a mechanic or two with it
---
Or if they are smart all the big Horde guilds will go together to Earthshaker to just continue from where they started. I can't imagine any sane guild would stay on that dead server now.
---
... does he have to know what country you were talking about? He was saying that wherever you were talking about sounds fucked up, and not all places are like that. Context lasts longer than one comment.
---
Flamelash is 3:1 H/A
---
Earthshaker is 1:6 H/A

&gt;Enjoy the dead PvE realm,

You too man, you too...
---
4k honour for a pvp player is really not that much but thinking about it pve = less players = less people fighting for honour = different ecosystem
---
I find it so funny when people go “HUR HUR WHAT IS THIS OFFICIAL SOURCE”
---
By the authority of my functioning eyes, incoming population data and this comment section being full of people saying “we’re moving too” and if you referred to WC logs you will see that it’s basically ALL the ally raiding guilds
---
Am I the only one that gets bored while leveling on a PvE server? I'm not sure if that's because I am leveling a warlock. But that wouldn't explain why I leveled a retri paladin to level 60 without this issue.
---
Even if they merged PvP with PvE, PvP has WAY more players on their servers (on average) than PvE
---
Lol Team Træls, is also om Bloodfang EU.
---
Also the PvP mega servers like Herod are way larger than the PvE servers
---
I can't downvote this enough.
---
BoP is better for this
---
Plus it doesn’t answer all the questions people have. Icy veins won’t tell you something like “X class feels more layed back while Y class is more dynamic”
---
Or how horde camps the boat forcing you to take ress sickness because the walk back from menethil gy takes to long so the boat departs again.
---
horde/ally is pretty balanced on ZT entering BRM is always a coin flip on who holds it in my experience
---
So he passed or what
---
There was/is yes
---
We see this on reddit nearly every day, so I'll give you the same answers :
---
- No change
---
- Go play on pve server
---
- the difference between a lv49 and a 60 is the same as between a fresh 60 and a bis 60, yes there is grinding in this game and yes that's why we play it, you can't always win, you can't always ask for the game to be fair, it's a mmorpg, if you don't like the concept then mobas could interest you
---
Have a nice day
---
The server is still High :) I don\`t know where all this craziness came from.
---
I think that only effects chat.
---
I agree. I dont pvp ever, but the sense of danger makes it exciting and feel less like a game and more like a real world.
---
Surely, they want people to stay where they are. But if it’s every realm cross server bgs and not battle groups then I don’t see the sense of closing free transfers other then to introduce paid ones
---
&gt; Leave it to toxic horde players to ruin WoW classic for many.
---
- /u/SactownKev 
---
Apparently you don't fit the description then so why do you feel so targeted?
---
That's too bad. They'd planned for this BG since vanilla, yet failed to deliver it till this day. I thought that was the siege game BG in WotLK. I'd love to have this BG instead of the Netherstorm one in TBC, which was basically a hybrid of AB and WSG.
---
Yes, of course, some people considered PVE servers as "not true to vanilla spirit" before p2 lol.
---
I missed the EU transfers on ZT-RPPvP, realm basically had a death sentence since day 1 with them having it available so soon, letting queue jumpers roll there and completely shit up the player pool. 
---
BRM runs take 40minutes, people drop out and have second thoughts before even getting to the dungeon, while Alliance ganksquads just keep doing laps and outnumbering us on every front. I would've been 60 on my shaman two weeks ago but now I'm stranded and it'll only get worse with BGs, nice job releasing BGs AFTER the honor system morons.
---
Sounds like you want to destroy two servers. If all the horde follow the Alliance your just going to recreate your old unbalanced server.
---
Used to? We might have knowledge on what is considered the best, but at the end of the day, everyone, knowing what's BiS or not, is just using what they could get.
---
&gt;Destroying the balance on another server because they are pussies and lost in open world pvp? They're doing now the exact thing they always blamed the "evil" horde for.
---
So there should be no issue with then transferring under that logic. Either having imbalance is an issue or it isn't.
---
Red is dead. Don\`t blame the players for the stupidity of Blizztard.
---
1. I am not a ranker so i donbnt care much about wpvp
---
2. BG queue will be still in largely alliance favour. Since globally there is more horde PvP players than PvE, but we shall see in few days
---
Pendulum of doom 😅
---
My friends convinced me to play pvp (as a lifelong PvE player). They quit weeks in and I’m stuck on a server I hate
---
Just got to wait for paid transfers
---
I've seen very little corpse camping overall (I play on Flamelash). The rare times I've had it happen to me I've usually deserved it (been out ganking lowbies in Darkshire or something).
---
Most people on the server have just been trying to have fun PVPing and farm honor. Naturally this happens mostly in groups, naturally 90% of fights one side outnumbers the other, and unfortunately for Flamelash it's almost always alliance that's outnumbered.
---
I understand the frustration but this is hardly the fault of horde players
---
Any advice on making money with fishing?
---
What's to stop low level players attacking high level players  giving them the choice of a dhk or allowing this pesky nuisance to just keep attacking them. Hopefully the introduction of bg's, will help to solve alot of this problem, I believe you will have to join the bg que either in the barrens/ashenvale or in the alterac mountains so I can see battles taking place near these hubs or returning to the tarren mill/southshore area while they wait out any queues but it would be alot of hassle for players to travel all the way back to searing gorge only for a queue to pop then having to travel back again to re queue after the game.
---
Ugh, i can already imagine how these would smell a month into re releasing...
---
Why should no one from PvE servers play BGs? Queue times gonna be fine. People with those doomsday comments are just doing them to feel superior as Alliance player or something.
---
Why do you think a server with a healthy population but without enemy faction presence is "dead"?
---
Blade for stamina and more sp
---
Why would a level 40+ need a level 27's loot though!
---
Same reply as to the triggered zug zug above.
---
1. I am not a ranker so I don't care much about wpvp
---
2. BG  queue will be still in largely alliance favor. Since globally there are more horde PvP players than PvE, but we shall see in a few days
---
Yeah that was basicly the gist yesterday, heavy lag so didn’t really matter how many raids we had since we all got AoE the moment we got inside BRM.
---
Blacksmithing makes no gold while leveling, and even at 60, its hard. You need to spend a lot of money leveling it and getting the recipes.
---
I would ditch it in favor of another gathering profession to make money, like skinning.
---
Going for wolf on my troll as well, best animation imo
---
Looks like paladin t2 :)
---
Yeah, people who want something in the realm of 60/40 to 50/50 faction balance are so sad.
---
I would try to transfer to another server.
---
You can blame Blizzard for some things but you have to learn and take your own responsibility aswell. Also reading helps
---

Can't fiery enchant on main hand break your gouge /sap?
---
Heartstriker.
---
Yes, it's that dominated. There are a bunch of equalized servers too, but you asked for a dominated server. Hearthseeker is at least 75 Alliance to 25 Horde, by recent census.
---
Yes, you are right. And everyone should have known what they are in for when they decided to play classic wow in the first place.
---
Do - let a rogue open on you so you can actually practice a real right. None of that AOE spam bullshit
---
I like TradeSkillMaster for profession tracking. I know it tracks mats that alts have; dunno if it goes into detail about learned/not learned though

You can't talk about a picture and not provide it!
---
The no change people are delusional. We had the same people when old-school runescape came out. People whined and cried that the game wouldnt be the same. No kidding the game happened 15 years ago, the only way that exact game lives on is in people's memories. 
---
So many things are different this go around. And jagex knew their game wouldnt be the same either. So they became the first MMO developer to implement a poll system into their game, where players can cast votes on current QOL, future updates and nerfs/balancing. ( They soon plan to make it to where the poll booths will be removed and brought into the user interface so players don't have to travel to a poll booth in game.)
---
This lead OSRS down a successful path. I loved 07scape. But what the COMMUNITY, and Jagex have created together is an all around better game, because we all agreed on it. The poll system allows things in that MMO to happen that other MMO communities can only dream of. 
---
Even if Blizzard doesn't implement a poll system or anything relevant in classic, they could give us the opportunity to do so when TBC or classic + or whatever is being talked about. 
---
 
---
Everyone has to listen to the no changes shit now, but moving forward I hope we can all agree that this game is fantastic, but in reality vanilla turned into retail. That's why we should all get a voice to say what should happen to our favorite MMO.
---
Je ne parle pas Francis
---
If I were Alliance on that server during AQ I'd upload videos of me vending rep turn ins to the server discord.
---
Fair enough, that would explain it. I have never used secondary keybinds for anything so it never occured to me that might be the case.
---
I tespect we read all this
---
The spider cave in Northwest Eastern Plaguelands is usually deserted
---
Sometime need pots to farm for gold spending 200 gold on potions puts you back a couple hours of gold farming when you could be farming consumes and raw gold at the same time.
---
Lmao, yeah because you're not paying attention. That's the point here. Literally every corner of the map had allies being corspecamped from P2 release til now.
---
And yes, it is 100% the fault of the horde zerg, as well as Blizzard for not implementing faction limitations to begin with.
---
I knew a guy who got exalted with WSG in TBC. He was so excited, as he had been working on it ever since a couple weeks after BWL was released.
---
Absolutely bonkers rep grind.
---
That was true before, but mah boy got himself unionized, and the union was able to lobby a bill to converge all auction houses into 1.
---
So now that all AHs are merged, the cut of the sales is evenly distributed as well!
---
Those greedy capitalists in IF is protesting heavily however, but when have they not been against anything benefitting Kalimdoor.
---
Perfect finally the answer I was looking for, appreciate it!
---
Good idea, tbh.
---
Is searing totem any good, I prefer magma totem because it doesnt have stupid AI.
---
In that case it's selfless, dumb and outrageous to waste a wipe recovery, unless there has left 1% of boss HP and you used all potions, runes, other CDs and you want to reset aggro from top of 3-4 dps left alive.
---
Ok
---
This is how we imagine you but with more tears.
---
Actually after reading this. I am happy ours is locked so it atleast stays 65-35.
---
Because if randomly in one night I am not active on WoW our server turned 95-5 i would honestly quit.
---
I don't have the time or energy to reroll back to 60. I have a social life, I wanted to experience the nostalgia of WoW and hit 60 and do endgame.
---
Not fight a losing battle of rerolling and rerolling because of a grieving community. I don't see why it is so hard to implement a faction queue and transfers om the dominant faction only and create a lock on creating characters on the dominant faction.
---
I find that rather normal in video games to have balancing mechanics in it.
---

You could transfer to a lower pop PvP realm in the meantime, they might be more like vanilla realms population wise.

Gets kinda obvious when you see 20 level 1 snipe-bots standing there 24/7
---
They did say that the opening would be region wide, so there is that
---
Oh at least you still get to press buttons when that starts. You know what's really frustrating? getting chain stunned because apparently Kidney shot needs to be on a separate  DR timer from other stuns
---
I dunno a lot of horde in the server discord have been bragging about how they "won" and are happy that the alliance are gone. I dont think we will be bringing those people with us to Earthshaker.
---
Sorry, just need to check: are guides a decent starting point now, or are they still, by definition, bad?
---
Run.
---
It *would have* been good if it was implented from the **VERY EARLY** start of classic. Implementing it as an after thought was probably a big mistake.
---
Do everyone in this sub a favour. Start by removing everyone below you, then work on convincing the highest mod you can find to remove everyone else. Do a full purge.
---
You can shift out, drink a pot and shift back instantly, as neither shifting out nor potting uses a gcd.
---
Put it in a macro and you basically stay in bear form as all of it is resolved in one spell batch.
---
Just wsg and av mate
---
Agreed. I am perfectly fine with the epic gear and especially weapons being very exclusive, and I know that even if I had all the time in the world, I wouldn't care to devote that much of it to the grind.
---
But i was really hoping to push for the blue set, and even that seems like it will be rather difficult and time consuming.
---
If your friend won't listen, just move on your own. The game will be entirely unplayable.
---
This happens on my server with troll hunters holding hydrocane and I’ve even told the guild about it that the bot is in and they don’t care 😭
---
Well its basically a pvp server without the possibility to pvp...
---
What exactly is it trinkets can dispell from a warrior that a priest dispel magic or a paladin cleanse  / BoF doesn't take care of?
---
They disband after 10 minutes because they aren't farming rank14 and not play 8 hours each day and won't patrol in Menethil for 4 hours to counter 5 rogues that might not come back.
---
And can you develop on how do you prevent a group of hardcore players to come back? I see absolutely no 'tool' in Vanilla to prevent hardcore PvPers to be a nuisance. Like I said, it's not like if you kill them once, they are send back on the other side of the world.
---
My god it's like you expect people to be griefed and do nothing about it. Karma sucks doesn't it?
---
I use that hair on my main warlock, its amazing! Prof. Putricide!
---
You mind doing some Bloodfang Horde censuses and uploading them? Maybe for Earthshaker too, depending on where you moved?
---
I play on Bloodfang and no Horde has uploaded data for nearly a week whereas I run it fairly consistently for Alliance, so the server looks massively Alliance favoured (which it is is definitely not).
---
English sub? Fkoff?
---
They aren't speaking on a topic they 'admit to knowing nothing about' though, have you not read this conversation?
---
They're saying that BiS is irrelevant. If it's an upgrade, you roll NEED. You don't have to pass on an upgrade that you may, or may not see again just because it's BiS for someone else.
---
It's not only ridiculous to suggest that, but it's moronic to imply that every single player should know every single the BiS for every single piece, for ever single class.
---
Our guy makes a couple hundred gold and offers it for free. Usually gets like 20/30 good a tip each time.
---
On EU? Ashbringer, Zandalar Tribe and Earthshaker/Bloodfang maybe?
---
Neither of them are real? :-O
---
Yeah but If I'm gonna replace it in a month for agi one no point in spending quite a bit of gold for it I think :) Thank you anyways, can't wait till I'm 29
---
BGs are a thing though and they are cross-realm.
---
inserting oblicatory naïve horde response:
---
pVp hApPeNd On pVpSuRvEr!11!one!!1
---
I think many horde guilds from flamelash will move the last day.
---
The point he is trying to make is that because or the changes put in place we are in a situation that didn't exist in vanilla. We got changes even though we didn't ask for them and ended up in our current situation because of it
---
To be fair, if you look at it from the warrior's perspective, you just took something that you can replace later this week with tier 1 but he can't replace until aq40. Maybe you don't know everything about the game, but you could at least understand somebodies frustration with that situation.
---
Bandage your target so he can’t use one during the duel
---
Sure good glad they lose all their hard work by ruining a game for others by mass camping 1 person  with 100+ people. My favorite is when you are in a raid and all 40 people get the dishonorable kill
---
Except for the very few allies who will be chased like rabbits
---
I know some asshole is going to vote you down and white knight blizz because it seems to be what some reddit autists love to do.  I just wanted to say that I feel you completely, brother.  I too played horde in vanilla when it was the underdog faction.  Rolled allie this time around because its what my friends wanted to do.  The allie have no bite to them.  I don’t get it.  They rather run into brd one by one and get picked off rather than group up and fight their way in.
---
Blizz lured me back into the fold briefly with Classic... but their handling of things has been a giant let down.  Phase two has been a shit show.
---
This is exactly why I asked if they have abused the transfer.
---
Not if it works like perditions blade proc. That dmg goes out same time as sap, maybe a bit before.
---
Aber bitte red weiter
---
Once you're level 60? Absolutely not.
---
Alliance did the same just as much as they could. The honor farmers couldn't hold BRM so instead alliance corpse ganked feralas and lowbies in wpl.
---
I mean I play alliance m8.  Dunno why you'd assume otherwise.
---
Have you ever tried horde Windfury ?
---
Yikes.
---
[deleted]
---
Wotf is a pain. But there are two huge weaknesses to warlock to keep in mind beyond that. 
---
The first is mobility. I can't state this enough how slow you are. You have no real ability to get away outside of swiftness potions and consumables. I'd say they're pretty much mandatory in serious pvp.
---
The second is soul shards and setup time. It might not seem like much, but it's an absolute pain in the ass. If you really want to try hard, you're going to need 3-4 shards every death basically (summon, health stone, spellstone, soulstone) . If you're a shadowburn spec, you'll probably be using shards quite often in combat. This means every death, you're not only using a bunch of shards, but it takes quite a bit of time to resummon everything and rebuff, too.
---
Most classes get a hell of a lot from rank 10 and that isn't unreasonable to ask for. I play a mage and plan to get rank 10 for the shoulders and boots. I am also planning to get exalted with AV for the offhand, and mount and I want the wand too, so that will likely get me quite a lot of honor anyway.
---
I'm sorry your German is as bad as my French
---
AH...
---
&gt;  how boned Alliance cities are for AH-&gt;banking-&gt;crafting. 
---
Orgrimmar is a thousand times worse than Ironforge and that's all that matters.
---
HAHA funny Punjabi movie free download 2017 no virus SURVEY. !!
---
I’m going to recommend you invest in getting exalted with Thorium Brotherhood and going Axesmith. Nightfall and Annihilator are hyper valuable because every raid wants them, and people who get them are near instant invites to raids.
---
Yep, so same as start of pvp on flamelash but reversed.
---
Our grinding made cash, and i just dug this out of the archives, i knew youd hate it, its in the title...thanks for hating.
---
Yeah sorry if they cant path up then it's probably aginst TOS the ones in tanris shoot too but cant path up and its aginst the TOS and they can shoot so....
---
Just save yourself and leave. Your friend will have to accept his own mistakes or wise up after seeing you go.
---
EPGP doesn't so much prioritise those who could make the best use like a loot council, but those who put in effort but have been rewarded the fewest pieces of gear.
---
You earn Effort Points (EP) for showing up to raid, downing bosses, or anything else your guild awards points for (donating to guild bank maybe). Then you are assigned Gear Points (GP) for any drops you get. Your Priority Roll (PR) is EP/GP, and whoever has the highest PR wins the item. 
---
So your PR goes up for contributing to the raid and goes down every time you get an item. You never spend EP or anything like that, but you do lose some percentage of EP each week to decay (maybe 10% for example) to prevent people hoarding.
---
The idea is that loot gets shared out evenly among those that put in equal effort. No 'AI'.
---
&gt;They disband after 10 minutes because they aren't farming rank14 and not play 8 hours each day and won't patrol in Menethil for 4 hours to counter 5 rogues that might not come back.
---
So in terms of wow classic, they are bad in pvp? Ok. Will a complainer appreciate an advice of "your problems come from the fact you're bad at pvp, so you better git gud"? I doubt so.
---
&gt;And can you develop on how do you prevent a group of hardcore players to come back? I see absolutely no 'tool' in Vanilla to prevent hardcore PvPers to be a nuisance. Like I said, it's not like if you kill them once, they are send back on the other side of the world.
---
Ok so they come back and you have your pvp on a pvp server but you win since you have more numbers. I don't see any reason to complain here?
---
Yikes. I was all in on that robe but not if I can't wear it. I'll stick with my top class Darth Vader bathrobe, thank you!
---
&gt;The grass is greener
---
For sure. I transferred to Bloodfang a few weeks ago. The game is actually  playable again.
---
I think it's a faction imbalance rant but hes a horde player that tried alliance
---
When I change keybind through Bartender I have an option to bind my binding to characters.
---
So you think that your personal out of the ass estimation is more accurate than collected data?
---
Eat my hole
---
Confirmed.
---
Oh, you mean Blizzard being the abuser? In that case yes.
---
I have a question about etiquette. As a druid, am I "allowed" to need on healing gear like leather/cloth with int/spirit/+healing when tanking/dpsing dungeons as Feral while leveling? Will people be mad at me for needing on gear both for feral tanking/dps AND healing gear so I can have a healing gear set as well?
---
'get's ganked once in last 4 weeks and server is "unplayable"'
---
LOL I thought the same thing.
---
I dont remember having mega servers back in vanilla.
---
It's likely Phase 3. The Agi enchant comes from being Honored with Timbermaw. You can grind the rep already but the recipe will be added later.
---
Folks will see that this may not always be an option for future content.  Some fights may req individual effort to get gear sets or they may be benched due to not contributing.  This is how it was, guess we will see how it actually is (AQ40/NAXX nature and frost). 
---
I have been lucky that if I need help, I ask folks directly and set up time and date for them to come lend me a hand. 
---
For me at least, most of my guild is “old” and has jobs and other commitments. But over 1/2 are in later in the evening and have been more than willing to give me some of there time. 
---
Im not sure of the full specifics of OP but from what was posted the member with the issue needs to move and find some guild thats a better fit.
---
&gt; They're both right.
---
Nah, #02 is wrong. It absolutely is rude to tell someone to "Google it". Either answer the question, or stay quiet. Anything else is just being a dick, for the sake of being a dick (whether that's in game, on Reddit, or elsewhere).
---
People also are allowed to dislike aspects of their class at endgame. It's ridiculous to suggest that everyone spend 3 days doing research to decide which class is best for min/maxing output during Raids.
---
I mean, after you sheep them you do wait out the honorless target debuff. So there is some waiting it out going on
---
Do you think wPvP will continue after BGs are released on Hydraxian? I'm thinking of re rolling there.
---
I was a wake up call for some guildies. Many have commented on the discord that I am always on and looking for a partner (I’m Druid and this my kill speed is too slow to efficiently solo gank)
---
I pointed out I have hit bracket 12 every week and will actually have to kick it up a notch for 3-4 weeks when I make my R13 push. A lot of the “I think I’m going to try for HWL. I know it’s hard but man those weapons are sick,” chatter died down after that
---
Part of the reason was because the alliance were shit heads. And you've further justified my move :)
---
No change, leave the game.
---
It is absolutely not their fault that they outnumbered the alliance. It is absolutely their fault that because there weren't enough farmable alliance players out questing or fighting in the world that they farmed them in places and in ways that they really shouldn't have.
---
Bist du dir sicher?
---
I’m not alliance lol
---
Just be thankful that's not your hair irl
---
\#Nochanges meant alliance were going to have a rough ride in P2, but #nochanges also means horde won't be punished since it's against the Vanilla model to limit BGs to server type.
---
Ja, dass binn ich
---
Could just be scatterbrained. I’ve met a few people who were incredibly knowledgeable about certain things then get lost in a chain of thought
---
Uhhh no. You don't get to corpse camp people in brm all day then demand to be left alone when fishing
---
r/JustNeckbeardThings
---
i dont know man, i dont do the honor grind myself, but almost nax tier weapons for R14 is insane tbh
---
The whole system does not seem worth it at all. Maybe it's because I'm older and simply don't have the time at all (wife, kids), but even when I played this as a teenager, I felt you had to sacrifice too much just to gain a few higher numbers in a video-game. This is your LIFE, you'd have to put on hold for several month, doing nothing else but grind. When we hate on micro-transactions, this is not the alternative I miss. There is no prestige in this, only labor.
---
Lol.. obviously
---
I'm so glad I work in a similar situation, not as a game developer but a software developer. We have over 500 employees only in our main location, but are not listed on the stock market or anything, so we are free to do our own thing in our own pace, and develop the software the way we think is right - things like restructuring the software framework, which is a huge benefit in the future but has no visible improvements for the customer in the short term? No problem! My boss being one of the founders of the company, was a developer himself and is not just some manager looking for max profit, so he understands if you tell him why something didn't work out as planned. No problem, we will move that feature to the next version. If I have my own ideas, I can present them and go for it.
---
If you want quality, don't force release dates. It's done when it's done. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to exist in the gaming industry anymore.
---
That is nothing like a loot council though, that's pretty much the opposite. A loot council would stack one hunter and ignore the others, this system would never finish 8/8 tier 1 on any hunter.
---
Not that shows the amount on the actual target in the same way you can see damage numbers on mobs.
---
Would have to strongly disagree. I would need more details on the player to really agree that he “deserves” the help he is asking for. 
---
I help folks that show effort or that ask. If they keep asking, I start to make note of it as it may become a dependency. 
---
Im not your lapdog or underling, Im your guild mate.   If your working on a BiS quest chain or having trouble with a quest, Im happy to assist. But if you give me a scumbag feel that you take and take and never give, the well will soon dry up. 
---
I have encountered multiple folks like this and can smell them a mile away with how they talk or act. 
---
While I agree that its nice the right thing to do is help the guild get stronger by helping them, its not always a realistic expectation to have someone travel 20min out of there way because your trying to do a quest 4 lvls over your. 
---
To me this shoots our red flags of lack of effort or knowledge.  Im happy to help fix the knowledge but lazy does not cut it with me.
---
funny thing is, earthshaker is considered dead as shit
---
Have they confirmed if it will be AV or WSG weekend on the first week, if if they are having BG weekends at all?
---
It's mostly the server size that ruins it. That's why there's nowhere near my vanilla experience. There's still sometimes queue on my server and there's just too many people.
---
what are you a warrior?
---
get first aid
---
Yep, you need 3% hit for every level your target is above you, and the racial gives you the equivalent skill of an extra level.
---
Yup. No way I'm gonna grind for the .1% drop chance on the warden staff or pay 600 gold when there's an almost as good weapon I can use with a much higher drop chance.
---
You should do an update on Earthshaker, cause alliance just ruined it.  
---
Earhshaker pop is around 1:6 for alliance
---
[http://wowpop.appspot.com](http://wowpop.appspot.com)
---
Yeah my enitre guild had a meeting last night and decided we all move from flamelash since we seemed to be the only raiding guild still left on the alliance side. IF was almost empty when i made the move last night. Such a strange and eeire experience.
---
Because it allows them to create a disbalance on server before a tool created in order to keep this balance (faction based transfer) is able to kick in.
---
Without any relation to the current server: let's say a perfectly balanced 50/50 server exists. One faction cooperates and massively transfers from the server, a lot of guilds at once. A disbalance of 80/20 is created, faction transfer kicks in but it's too late since these guilds transfer at once: leaving the remaining people to their doom trapped by the very same faction based transfer.
---
Ain't even mad, that's amazing.
---
I choose Silvermoon over others everytime on TBC. Silvermoon died after cataclysm. It's a small packed city with multiple ah/bank/vendor options. It is very useful when you can't just fly by everywhere. It is the main road to ZA aswell which is a necessary visit for your time trial that week. Later you were able to fly Queldanas from there too. TBC is the last expansion you can't call Silvermoon's death. Every capital died with Dalaran on WotLK. They tried to avoid that on Cata but Silvermoon took a huge hit there. 
---
Exador on the other haaaaand was dead on delivery.
---
I believe it's common knowledge at this point that classic=/=vanilla and a ton of changes have been made to the game so #nochanges is just a pipe dream. Out of a million changes, only the important one hasn't been made.
---
So true. I was holding BRM for over 1 hour Saturday around 18.00 o'clock. We where 12 I think and pushing grupes of 40+  out. We had one insane push with over 50 hk. We were getting 4-5k honor an hour.
---
Wtf are you smoking.
---
Servers are great, just make a population difference cap to ensure balance is maintained.
---
We're talking about reducing our hp ourselves for when horde kills us.
---
Stahp! Just stahp!
---
at least its not another, "How to farm ZF GY"
---
Is it really that hard for you to believe that the majority of Alliance who rolled PvP actually want to be on a balanced PvP server? 
---
&gt;The stuff a lot of alliance players complain here happens everywhere.
---
Yeah, but it happens to both factions rather than just one... Lol.
---
There's a huge difference between what occurs on a realm with a 1:1 faction ratio and a realm approaching 3:1 ratio.
---
Premades in BGs aren't the most honorable thing, either. Dunno how it will work out with region-wide matchmaking, at least in a smaller community people quickly figure out which premades are stronger and the weaker one just accepts their loss - 6 minutes for 400 honor is better than 15 minutes for the same amount.
---
I play as Horde on Razorgore, and as other have said, it isn't only Alliance grouping up to get into MC!  There are generally multiple raids forming on a Wed evening in Kargath that move out together.
---
On the whole the server seems reasonably well balanced.  More Horde, but Alliance has several hardcore PvP guilds and generally more hardcore PvP'ers who seem to even things up pretty well. Looking at you, GOONS.
---
Blizzard doesn't create the grind. The grind is there because each player is competing against the entire server population and there are enough players willing to grind ridiculous hours that others have to do the same to keep up. The only way Blizzard's choices impact the amount of work put in is how their system rewards quantity over quality and, of course, how strong the rewards are.
---
This crap is all over the place so a TLDR is out of the question, but I'll try bullets for you folks.
---
*Alliance have worse PvP ratials
---
*Alliance are bad at PvP because they don't have engineering
---
*Paladins only spam cleanse and flash of light in PvP = bad
---
*TBC will have worse imbalance because Blood Elves are sexy af
---
*Nost was good vanilla, Classic is bad vanilla
---
*Classic was doomed from the beginning 
---
Anyway, Classic isn't for everyone.  Have fun in your elite tournament realm thingy.
---
I'm sorry you are too stupid to understand my point.
---
Obviously the alliance will do the exact same if they're the dominant faction.
---
Or he has been spending some of it...
---
Log out to save your disguise.
---
Okay but whats your point? All it is is a laugh mate, people enjoying the game and organizing big raid groups to roll out like an army for 20 minutes on one night of the week lol??
---
&gt; they said BGs are gonna be cross realm
---
I've only heard players say this so far.
---
This is tagged as humor/meme. This is neither, unless it's ironic, then it's not funny either.
---
Should probably learn how to use berserker rage if you're going to tank Ony.
---
It depends on the overall server population.
---
40/60 is probably okay on medium/low pop servers.
---
It makes the game completely unplayable on full or high pop servers.
---
Where do you damage numbers go if not the center? Got a pic?
---
You're very cringey. You shouldn't get this way over Reddit comments. It's not good for ya.
---
Well go for it then but I agree with Nujja - right now you have an relatively emtpy Server. Go farm Gold and wait for Mergers :D You will be set by the time this Comes along!
---
Alternatively just Transfer. Is there Transfer Options available for you? I thought there needed to be a Queue or something in order to be able to transfer
---
Okay, maybe I will consider druid. I was thinking the pally could tank.
---
I bit the bullet and rerolled PvE. With no sight of PvP to PvE transfers in sight, that's pretty much the only option.
---
I believe it is the same as retail BGs.  You can only trade HS, water, etc.
---
Blizzard said even before launch they expect a lot of people to quit though. I guess people will just prove them right.
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/vUsLEr66LRba3hU87
---
I'm using Pitbull for player frames (and loving it), however it doesn't seem to have any Raid frames (even if I select Raid from the drop down in the config).
---
Do I need a separate plugin for that?
---
Never liked this set.  The entire idea of having books as shoulder pads makes nonsense.
---
I'm a 45 on Kirtonos. I've heard from guild mates that the Plaguelands are bad right now. However, I have had a pretty good experience so far. Yes, there seem to be more horde but  the alliance on this server are spunky and willing to group up and fight back.  Have joined in numerous ad hoc pvp groups from Darkshire to Tanaris.  And if I put a call out for help in the general channel, someone usually comes to help out.
---
I’m looking for a “smart casting” macro for grenade throwing not sure the term but I guess it’s Kindof a mouse over macro so I can throw the grenade just by hitting a button on my bar without clicking
---
What does that make you? Lmao
---
And what about the Horde players who don't engage in any of the FM camping, raid banking etc.?
---
Trying to screw rest of the horde is so honorable smh
---
Oh yeah like that recently posted hunter R14 gameplay video, complete with backpedaling and clicking.
---
Blizzards built-in cheat protection does not detect the latest bots. To keep it simple and to avoid getting in any trouble here, it essentially is because of the following:
---
Blizzards anti-cheat system literally scans your computer for suspect programs that may also be running.
---
The new bots are not running locally on the same computer but are instead separated by a VM.
---
OR the bot is running locally but has a bunch of features built-in to avoid being detected (like changing process name, changing hash, etc.) and the theory is they can and will be detected at somepoint.
---
As others have said, they typically ban in waves so the creators/users have a more difficult time determining how the bot program was caught.
---
Any single bans are due to mass reports and/or a GM seeing the activity. Since GMs barely exist in Classic, you can see why the reports typically don't do much.
---
As a rogue, a fight vs a warrior doesn’t even start until they are out of stunlock. Either pop evasion and go for it if they’re very low or lite then in their dead zone.
---
Ah! Thanks for the info. Never had the retail experience.
---
lmfaooo
---
No. Because a lot of people get pissy at someone taking an item that is not BiS, but is still an upgrade over current gear. 
---
Lots of people are scared to need roll.
---
If its not 1 guild council is a horrible idea, as you stated the salt will be real and people will just stop showing up and PUGs will run away as they will feel there chance at loot will be near zero. 
---
Go for something that rewards attendance (DKP Type system) and effort. 
---
This will help get mac effort and attendance from folks. 
---
It will require a little more work but its worth it as any PuGs will want to keep coming back to keep earning points to be able to get loots.
---
Concerned for you.
---
Yea they are, but faction unbalance is a problem on many servers. Horde outnumbers alliance in total number quite abit, even more on pvp servers. 
---
So I expect BG queues for horde to be pretty long. And on a server without an opposing faction most pvp oriented players wont have anything to do beside standing in Org or dueling.
---
Its a shame, this AH NPC has by far the best view! Was going to start using him because of that, but since im not a mage, its such a drag!
---
On my server horde normally rotate between ganking MV and the entrance from Redridge, keeping a few rogues/mages at both locations to sheep/sap so the raid as a whole can benefit.
---
Agreed feels well balanced but seems that horde control areas most of the day whereas alliance only seem to control areas for select hours on days. No complaints tho, happy here on razergore with da bois!!
---
What is the combat text addon?
---
Such is life, they can thank their own faction or transfer.
---
&gt;As bars 
---
azshara
---
Thanks for caring, you seem like a good man. I hope you have a blessed morning
---
Then - don't do it! People are saying that 2H arms is *optimal*, not the only spec. You could level prot if you wanted, it's possible. If it gives you joy, go for it.
---
Dwarves lowest? If you're making up graphs do it right.
---
damn
---
If they start bringing back classic shop items, I'm looking forward more to the 3 pack of opera posters from Karazhan.  Hitting myself over not getting them before.
---
Dunemaul! I played on that server. Damn it was a good server. A Few Good Man, etc. MEMORIES!
---
There are plenty of successful cross-guild raid groups. I dispute your statement.
---
That just doesn't work in practice.
---
**Q: Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live?**  
---
**A:** Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you’ll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in [Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-pvp-content-plan/146049).

You welcome.

Unless it's a pool of Elemental Water. In which case guns out. I'm watching you, Artur.
---
I think ally players don't actually like or care for pvp, that's the issue.
---
I think given the choice, all the allience player would reroll/move to pve servers.
---
Faction based transfers already exists and has been live for several weeks. Which is why I ask? Why is it abuse if the alliance use their free transfer when Blizzard obviously got the tool to enable facation based transfer but decide NOT to?
---
That's the spirit!
---
It’s obviously a joke
---
Please deliver OP! We would accept a pic with faces censored :D
---
&gt;Gross gains
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Weekly gross gains are based not only on Bracket, but where you stand in the Bracket. The lowest player in Bracket 12 gains relatively the same amount of points as the highest player in Bracket 11.

&gt; Gross Gains = 1000 * [Bracket - 2 ; Bracket - 1]
---
&gt; Someone at the lower end of Bracket 12 would gain just a bit over 10000, while someone at the higher end of Bracket 12 would gain close to 11000.
---
What's the difference between this system of 14 brackets, and a system of sorting everyone by honour gained that week and allocating it in proportion to their rank?
---
The latter sounds less complicated, and is surely identical to the system you're describing.
---
So... You have a problem with BLIZZARD because of the way PLAYERS play the game that They pay for every month?
---
I can't even.
---
I use this. It dispels your target normally or yourself if you hold shift:
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [mod:shift,target=player] Devour Magic; Devour Magic
---
Your estimate is way too high, I think. A stack of medium leather vendors for 10s, so the average skinning attempt would probably be worth about 5 copper. And that's not even counting all the crappy leather scraps and light leather you need to get through, which pulls the average even further down. You only start getting heavy leather and thick leather around lvl 40.
---
Ate you implying the alliance are cute baby killers?
---
Now I'm motivated more than ever to help out those baby rogues ganking the alliance all day.
---
Yeah that one
---
Thank you for your input. 
---
I'm not too sure about defense in SM. You are right, it get´s more important with rising Mob Level, but the amount of int you get by going with T1&amp;2 is so great you can just allow to stop every now and then and heal up. At least theoretically (i'm using this build [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkZVGzIczx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkZVGzIczx)).
---
Ty!
---
Nope, never had a DHK because I don't AOE bomb anything and everything. I have been 15v1 several times and camped 5v1 several times also. I'm sure all those players had no mean intentions at all.
---
Believe this man!
---
I didnt think this was the case till I did a few runs on content I needed nothing from....

this one works for me
---
What party frames are those?
---
Yeah, would like to try and find them somehow. I imagine many are playing
---
You know perfectly well that if you say at someone 'git gud' he will think of skills and not time investment and therefore get angry because he will argue (rightly so) there's no skill involved after being ganked by 5 rogues.
---
If you tell to someone that PvP in WoW is mostly time investment and they should play more to have a better chance, then they would agree and just say it's stupid.
---
And you haven't answered me: what happen if the group doesn't come back? you spend your afternoon patrolling Menethil?
---
You mean much like Undead (WotF), Orc (stun resistance) and Tauren (increased HP and aoe stun).
---
Its a great thing once you have all the BiS items and can sell spots to PuGs. 
---
They are the ones you want to get the gold from, not your guildies!
---
They probably think you're there to steal their essence pools
---
Fuck earthshaker, if you're horde OEB is great pve dps while still good enough to thrash people in pvp regardless of faction.
---
not even close to accurate
---
All rogues are crutches man. Roll a real class.
---
Yeah, why would alliance want to transfer to an equally unbalanced server...
---
&gt; You can’t deathwish in Arms spec.
---
Unless you're a certain popular bug exploiting PvP video maker in 2005...
---
Shadowed Unit Frames
---
Ahh, but horde bad according to this sub.
---
You can't make any actions at all in DI'd buff. Not hearth, not eat, not anything.
---
Not really. 
---
Most went to Earthshaker and Bloodfang, so mosy over to one and /who those you remember.
---
You mean mage water right? So just impermanent items
---
Ok tauren is out of the picture.
---
Your orc is 33 and you're bored. Do you think switching to troll is gonna have such a significant impact on gameplay that you won't get bored for the exact same reasons?
---
The +5 axe skill on orc is probably generating a good amount of threat extra for you without cooldown and drawbacks...
---
Feel like you want to go troll jsut to stand out, if thats really worth it to you, then go for it, but I can definitely see you getting bored of it after already having 33 levels on warrior...
---
Explain to me how you hope to open the AQ gates without "enemy faction presence"? You do know that Alliance and Horde both have their unique set of goals to complete before the gates can be opened right?
---
I like to skip the tanning in DM T runs with a bubble-DI deathskip. Just gotta have another resser on the other side to DI.
---

Cute
---
Arena did to R14 what MMA did to martial arts.
---
It showed to the world what really matters in (small scale) PvP. Not that many Vanilla R14s actually had success in rated PvP.
---
You obviously don’t understand anything about fury warriors.
---
Well considering how outnumbered we were we got 5/6 Kazzaks (except release date, where we were fcked over by Disabled).
---
For Azuregos we got 2/5 and in the lose cases it was always the issue that we were 40 and horde was 200 in the end. Your pulls were pathetic tbh.
---
So ye considering how screwed was the server we did really well.
---
Ghosted
---
do you actually think before you hit post?
---
Lol git gud nobody cares. We can all make up stories about bads.
---
Depends on who else is in your group and what level you are.
---
For example [Whitemane's Chapeau](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7720/whitemanes-chapeau).
---
If you're healing in a group with Rogues/Warriors/Shamans/Paladins/Hunters I doubt anyone will care if you roll on it.  
---
If there is a Lock/Priest/Mage in your group then they'll probably be a bit miffed if they lose the roll to you.
---
Priority in general goes something like:  
---
Main Role &gt; Off Role &gt; Gold
---
But IMO that means if your main spec is Feral and you're healing a dungeon, players shouldn't be surprised if you roll on Feral gear. But similarly just because you're healing doesn't mean you shouldn't think twice about rolling on int gear, be mindful of who you're grouped with.
---
A lot of this drama can be avoided by setting expectations early.
---
"Hey I'm healing but I'm Feral so I'll be rolling on feral gear :)"
---
Or if you're wondering if you can roll on any given piece of gear something like "Can I need for healing gear?" will usually clear things up.
---
Did they? I don't think they ever have to be fair. Atleast i've never heard of it. During MoP (i think, might have been Early WoD) they did do "Connected-Realms" on Retail. Which look like merges but aren't actually real merges.
---
Warlock in sl with PvP Gear? Yes.
---
In bis Gear and pve spec like most people? You get two shotted.
---
There’s no 1v1 in the world either, it’ll be at the very least 1 enemy + the mob you were killing against you.
---
You can make 3x Rank 10s in the same time it takes to get 1x Rank 14.
---
Not sure why someone would do that to themselves either way.
---
Probably got them on week 1 where they were meaningless. Guy is rank 8, he's obviously not getting DKs regularly this week or last week.
---
'sucks for the horde'
---
the horde did this to themselves. They can rest in the bed they made.
---
I've been on Earthshaker for some months. BRM/Searing gorge was mostly horde dominated. Same as lights hope chapel etc. Even if the horde are in a slight disadvantage in numbers they pvp more.
---
I dont think you mean what you think you mean 🤣
---
LC picks based on lots of variables, as defined by the GM and leads. 
---
EPGP rewards based on attendance/effort and what not. 
---
The more you show up, the more EPGP rewards.  The better you do with what you got the more LC will give you, as you prove to be able to use the loot to its best ends.
---
i am currently running MC with guild where we do loot council and say who can roll on it and not. As i am running as pre raid bis feral druid and feral tank ot i find it impossible to get my first epic after 5 runs of mc and ony, as all the hit gear agility rings are tanking rings and there aint much to get after those rings and a leather braces, even if all the tanks get those items in 10 weeks i have to compete against 20 other physical dps who already have 5-10 epics and i have 0, should i change guilds with DKP just to get some items for now and in BWL, i see that if all others will spend  points on their tier set and other stuff i will have more points to outbid them on my 3 items that are dropped in whole MC.
---
It's not what I want, it's what I think will happen when I try to observe the situation neutrally.
---

There's almost zero clutter in the middle of his screen at all besides combat text, looks really clean.
---
Man, save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
So much this!!!
---
Im usually smiling more.
---
OP rolls a DPS warrior because guides told him it's broken in both PvP and PvR classic.
---
OP performs really bad in PvP, dies to casters with bad engages.
---
OP decides the reason for his performance can't be him, it has to be something random. Let's pick spell power because all casters benefit from it.
---
OP goes to Reddit to get confirmation that the reason is spell power, not his performance.
---
Not SL locks.
---
I can be a paladin and my wife can be the Druid. Role play!
---
Tell your group in the beginning that you'll be rolling on non-tank gear. Be clear about your intentions and it should be okay.
---
Combat your best spec at 29 for example improved sprint and disarm is huge.
---
I think you should to pick one or the other.  Healing gear or DPS but not both.  
---
If you are rolling off-spec imo the best bet is to just say at the start you'll be rolling on healing gear.   
---
Don't ask, just say.  If someone doesn't like it they can kick you or leave.  
---
Rolling on both healing and feral gear may raise some eyebrows and piss some people off.  
---
Of course if nobody else needs a drop then go for it.
---
The username should have gave it away
---
Were the world filled with people like you, we'd still be living in caves, using rocks and sticks to beat animals to death to survive.
---
Attempting this in a raid is reckless, and should never be done without explicit permission, and even then, should only be attempted on easy content (so, like, all content at the moment) in an effort to gain information. 
---
But to mock him for even asking the question? Truly, the greatest thing to ever happen to humanity was to recognize that idiots like you should be completely ignored.
---
Again, the shatterspear trolls are a group of 50-60 mobs that have a big loot table but drop tons of major healing / superior mana potions, as well as tons of world drops / runecloth. Enjoy
---
yeah highest frostbolt i've seen in full pve gear, flasked, toep + ap was a 3240 crit in mc
---
All I can think of is the Horde going, Mine...Mine..MIne..Mine...MIne...
---
i reckon its looking that way
---
Would it be feasible to try this on a fury warrior? Considering there is better goldmaking methods thought this could be nice and chill grinding.
---
Grind Silithus. Nobody likes Silithus.
---
My man. Did the same on my gnome warrior back in vanilla.
---
I mean what is there to report, I was stupid and didn't check things before paying.
---
Even though you are out of combat in the game, you're very much not out of the combat situation in front of you being sheeped before a mage. OP is arguing thus that it should be refreshed as you're being controlled.
---
For on this day RNGesus said be, and I did. I am become death.
---
It 100% does not worth with gouge... I make a macro on my rogue for /cast gouge /laugh and it has never once broken early
---
So this was one guy? There is a crowd of alliance there. How exactly does one guy camp a crowd? They easily could kill him. Sounds like alliance are mad that pvp happened on a pvp server.
---
Yes, but Blizzard will automatically open the gates if one of the factions is sabotaging the process by not completing war effort on time and that's kinda common knowledge.
---
BoP doesn't wipe threat, only makes mobs temporarily ignore the target until it wears off. Any threat that the target has when BoP is cast, and any threat that the target gains during its effect, will remain, and if the target is still highest on a mob's threat table, the mob will come right back to that player.
---
This is not to say that DI should be used as a threat management tool. That's not a good idea at all. But it is something I am curious about. More information is never bad.
---
Yes, sorry.  Mage water/food.
---
Just made a toon on flamelash to see how bad things there and IF/SW are brutally empty.  
---
Really sad to see a whole faction bullied off a server
---
My biggest regret in life was not using that.
---
You just admitted you kick people for not knowing what their bis is.  That’s being an asshole.
---
You are the problem and you don’t even seem to know it.
---
Mistakes were made
---
Can you not clearly see the image? If so then what difference does it make?
---
No private server ever came anywhere close to what classic wow has population wise.
---
Tunics.... Of course, then there is no need to wear those oppressive trousers and pants.
---
I mean it could happen, but eventually the word will get out that you will do it for free.   Just a matter of time
---
Ah OK. Looks different for me. Cheers!
---
Is this official? can you link to bliz saying this pls?
---
&gt; What are people stuck on underpopulated realms supposed to do? Get camped wherever they go?
---
Wait a few months for when the inevitable paid transfers to any server they want get added. They've done nothing to stop a situation that leans more and more towards a paid solution in their favour. I hope I'm wrong but releasing a 2005 version of WoW doesn't stop Blizzard being 2019 Blizzard always out to make a buck.
---
The brackets are simply used to fix the goal posts : How much honor is required for Rank 13 is equal to whatever honor the lead player of that bracket has. The system is continuous in every other way.
---
I have the Death Knight robe. I wear it to raves and get tons of compliments
---
There are 2 different types of resist, spell miss that is affected by hit % and resist because of resistance on target. Resistance can cause partial or full resist. One of them is white the other is yellow not sure which one though.
---
Moving war effort materials through the neutral ah.  That real shit money laundering
---
Hello Sir,
---
back then we were on Aegwynn, it was a 70-80% Alliance / 20-30% Horde.
---
We had a small community where every player was important, we opened the AQ40 Gates (ringed the gong) and managed to clear Naxxramas as horde 3rd on a alliance dominating server.
---
So don't cry and be a man. :)
---
What do you base the assumption that people who pay for a transfer would quit in a month on ?
---
You better hurry - transfers are closing.
---
I actually wear my Death Knight robe to every Bassnectar show I go to lol
---
That's fine if you don't believe me, I was just trying to warn the guy based on what I was shown from a guild member. Everyone knows that every GM at blizzard is on the same page and they don't make mistakes one way or another though.
---
Summoned items only, yes.
---
Point proven by all the down votes.  There was no reason to downvote someone sympathizing with the OP.  It wasn’t a crying rant, he dissected problems that many people sympathize with.  But I guess when you’re a 20 year old “get gud” edge lord you need someone to shit on when you’re not camping flight paths.
---
Earthfury is 100% Ally dominated. Camped non stop since I hit 50. Takes 5-10 deaths to get into BRD. 
---
Of all the people who are on my friends list from leveling, most quit at 49.
---
Well. ive landed in the 10k rp bracket twiice and the 11k rp bracket once.
---
So im not particularly worried about not getting my ahnds on the blue set and possibly a cheap Ne mount down the line. That is unless ranking hen bgs come out beocmes harder.
---
I guess it all depends on what systems will be working under the hood when it comes the the matchmaker BG-que. 
---
If premades gets to stomp randoms all day long then premades will be the only way to get any sort of high rank. However if modern matchmaking systems are in place it will be about as even a field as we have currently in outdoor ganking.
---
Mages dishing out 3.5k damage at the end of every 2.5 second cast is a bit over exaggerated.
---
For a deep frost Mage wearing PvP gear to do the amount of damage you're describing, it would require a minimum of 5.5 seconds of unhindered casting/setup wherein all abilities crit. We're talking about a Frost Nova (to enable Shatter's +50% crit chance), followed by a Frost Bolt crit (\~1600 dmg), into Cone of Cold crit (\~1100 dmg), followed up by a Fire Blast crit (\~900 dmg). And that combo can only be done once every \~20 seconds with Frost Nova and there's still \~40% chance that any of those abilities don't crit even if you're in nova.
---
If you have no option but to sit in Nova and face tank shatter combos, clearly Mages are just a hard counter to your class and you'll need to rely on consumes/items to help you in that matchup.
---
Yeah, split between Earthshaker or Bloodfang. Bloodfang has a smaller, but still healthy population. Earthshaker is larger but many tryhard guild moved over and I'm not really sure how that will affect the atmosphere of the server.
---
I'm thinking a Boomkin robe 😁
---
That... is goddamn genius. There's a lock in our raid that is getting quite geared (has 1 of our 2 mageblades, and regularly parses 95%+) and he almost always has threat on Ony when she lands. A BoP would help so much. Why didn't I think of that... I mained a paladin for years &gt;&lt;
---
I shall have to speak to our paladins... Thank you!
---
Unconscious is not consent!!!
---
That's the best solution. Be clear about it from the get-go, and if you're feral DPSing and some int/spi piece drops, see what others do before rolling and if it seems appropriate, just check in if you can grab it for offspec.
---
It may depend on the software of your mouse, not sure. Mine just show as whatever button they are assigned to.
---
On my server you can't really make money with mining in the open world as an Ally unless you have a stealth class, pref rogue. The most consistent income will be from jump runs in DM E.
---
Levelling and getting good recipes is a dump of gold. You won't make it back at this point in time anymore as monopolies on the rarest recipes are gone (most non-casual guilds have a token crafter by now), the specialisation quest requires big funds for a new toon too. Do it if you feel like you like the combination, the roleplay feel, or if you want to be the token crafter in a guild; don't do it for gold.
---
Nutha won
---
Ahahhhaha! Nice bot!
---
I like to /wink at rogues I trap after they engage me, never got the problem to this day honestly. I'll try some other emotes next time.
---
"I know what I am doing is stupid and wrong, but I am gonna do it anyway."  
---
Taking stupid actions that hurts everyone and has long-reaching consequences that you won't take responsibility for? You are a horde by blood I see.
---
No that’s reasonable cause nobody else can use the items
---
They gotta milk them upboats somehow
---
Lol sad but tru
---
Oily Blackmouth, Winter Squid, Nightfin Snapper are all great. The Azshara spots are usually so heavily contested that there's very little point in trying outside of the hours when 80% of the realm is asleep.
---
Kek
---
The Unstoppable Force is such a boon to casual players. I remember back in the day, I had no idea what I was doing, but I saw that hammer, and so I ran AV over and over, and it felt so good to get it.
---
Dont feel sorry in the slightest for any horde still on flamelash.
---
Sever transfer's have been open for both factions to find more balanced situations and the dominant side clearly just wanted it easy so fuck em hope you get stuck there in a wasteland.
---
It makes a difference if your servers alliance players weep easily or act like normal players instead, playing the game.
---
&gt; this is vanilla.
---
No, it's not. I got WoW for Christmas 2004 and played Vanilla entirely on Kil'Jaeden US. PvP server, full/high pop the entire duration. There was not 50 man gank squads in every zone, 20 people on every boat, 30 people on every Zeppelin. Server population caps were far too low to have this number of people everywhere at all times.
---
Lok tar
---
Yeah he asked me to BoL him when she landed one time and I decided to just bop for safety

As a potential solution to this doom, do you have any idea how Blizzard or the classic community feels about same faction BGs? Any imbalance vanishes if you let horde v horde or mixed faction teams happen. 
---
I know if fucks with the story and immersion. Personally, idc about that and would pick a sustainable, accessible pvp option over purity 10/10
---
Have a problem with my UI, a bar from the artiste blizzard bar can't be moove.

Yeah, I agree. There is so much whining when something drops and the person who loses is like "Its my best in slot" /sulk for ever.
---
I cared in vanilla, so I don't care now, but people seem to care WAY more than ever.
---
If you go invulnerable mobs will try to drop aggro off of you.
---
*Record scratch *
---
Yeah, that is me. You are probably wondering, how I got into this situation? Well it all started a few weeks ago......
---
This is the way.....
---
Stick it out*, you will be doing MC for a very long time and pre-raid BiS is hard to upgrade. 
---
*If you like the group. Kitty/Bear gear is hard to upgrade as most of the stuff is resto. 
---
MC has like 3 things and ony neck... 
---
would also recommend you talk to an O/LC lead and see what they thing your spot in loot rotation is. 
---
If you really dont like LC or the guild, then try and find something more your flavor.  If your just after loot, you may have a hard time finding a fit.  I say this due to the RnG and 2 items per boss for 40 people.....
---
My own experience with LC, I got no drops until week 4, when I got the Leaf from Domo.  Since then, i have slowly gotten other drops along the way. Its just a slow grind m, sadly. Been clearing MC since week 3.
---
So this is the current state of classic: 
---
Oh shirt we’re getting clapped better move to an alliance dominated server.
---
Fuck fishing
---
Getting crit once every six seconds is way better than getting mauled by mortal strike, whirlwinds, autoattacks, and overpower anyway because as a rogue you will dodge some.
---
What flying? He is a mage.
---
When BG's release the world will be much closer to P1 than it is currently since honor farmers will be in BG's and not roaming gank squads.
---
That is fucking crazy man.
---
The problem is that many seem to have the inability to project even a few weeks into the future. Yes, camping flight paths (also usually a no as 9 out of 10 times I’m killed before I even give honor) and doors at BRM might be “efficient” for the time being, but no one should be surprised that people get fed up with it. Everyone is free to blame whoever they want but truth is, camping BRM and flight paths are ruining the experience for people and they will leave/stop playing. They aren’t abusing anything I agree, but they should understand they are screwing up for themselves that’s all
---
Some people are just too obsessed with their random googled list they follow all game to avoid thinking as much as possible.
---
Sure. Just gonna kill you and wait for respawn then.
---
&gt; The mats start accumulating automaticly after a period, don't know how long. But the gates will open significantly later yeah.
---
Wasn't that system of auto-completion of collection only added in TBC after several new realms opened without the AQ Gates done? It wasn't until patch 3.0.8 that new servers automatically had AQ Gates open on day 1.
---
Shooting fish in a barrel is no big-game hunting.
---
But humans have never been good at keeping the environment at a sustainable level, not in game and not in real life, so who can blame them.
---
Or the 2 butcher's blades I bought for 3.5 and 6 gold that are now going for like 60g to 80g
---
I see purple, I roll need. Cht while you already have flurry axe as an orc smh. Loot hungry warriors are mostly all the same. Keep using your flurry axe and apologize to the rogues in your raid team.
---
Yeah, but it seems like there's way more Horde overall in Classic.  There's a few Alliance dominated servers, but tooooons of Horde dominated servers.
---
You can talk to an NPC in Darkshore to phase your character to the pre-Burned state. Same with Pre-Blighted Undercity, and pre-Sworded Silithus.
---
This game isn’t balanced around pvp but the matchup can go either way if the rogues good and geared.
---
But again can you show nuance? like you can like Classic but find that honor system is stupid and PvP isn't working as it should? 
---
And ok you go away from Menethil with your 10 man anti-rogue squad... you go to BRM and there's 20 people attacking you because, as we established, your faction is underpopulated. Bonus the rogues are Menethil are back at killing people one by one.
---
I mean there's just no winning in the great scheme of things: you can make small group and move a lot to avoid being zerged, you can can sometimes gather a lot of people to fight back so for 30min, the other faction isn't dominating in a specific area but in the end it won't change anything: you log on the day after and you have 5 rogues jumping on you at the flight path.
---
Seems a little silly to say it’s a world they created. 
---
Unless I’m missing part of the story and the Horde on that server were sending Alliance players death threats or something if they didn’t transfer off, it seems like this is a world the former Alliance players of that server created.
---
I like the idea of varying the numbers on racials depending on how much of an underdog your faction is.
---
Oh yeah thanks xD
---
Ask before. If someone in group also needs and is filling the roll, I personally would not.
---
Daggers on fury warriors LOLOLOL
---
It's not like the shoulders wouldn't get replaced by the Domo shoulders that no other class wants which drop every second run.
---
Has it been updated to work again? I dropped it after blizzard disabled the addon a while ago.
---
My experience is that the people who complain the most about nobody helping are the same ones who never offer to help when anyone else is asking.
---
I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. Yes, they are the easiest class to gank with, stealth alone allows that, but there are so many tools in the rogue's toolkit that can be utilized that truly makes them an amazing class to play. All 3 talent trees have abilities that are useful in pve and pvp, which makes theorycrafting and testing their specs so much fun, and while a dumb rogue will go and try to stunlock an enemy, or try to ambush/backstab an enemy to death, a good rogue will sap target A, stunlock target B, blind target C, then gouge target B to be able to fall back into stealth. And if all that fails, they have cooldowns that, while powerful, will get a rogue nowhere if not properly utilized.
---
Oh, you have a bleed on you, but want to vanish? A dumb rogue will just vanish anyways, and wonder why it broke as they get killed. A good rogue will make a quick judgement call on how long the bleed will last compared to the need to vanish, and, if necessary, vanish immediately after a bleed tick and use the 2-3 seconds they have to accomplish what they needed to vanish for.
---
I main a warrior, but ever since I leveled a rogue in TBC, they have by far been the most fascinating class to me. If it weren't for my strong desire to tank, I'd main a rogue.
---
You know what else interrupts cast? Running back to your corpse. I’d rather wave back :D
---
They feel superior while not having to think at all.
---
This is not exclusive to Horde. It's about which faction is the dominant one. If Alliance had been the more popular of the two, we'd be in the same situation but mirrored.
---
Downvoted for stating facts, okay then.
---
I agree, post the pic man. That would be sick
---
Absolutely. I dread going to UC... and I'm Undead.
---
Honesty it’s neither the alliance nor the horde on flame lash there’s to blame. 
---
Blizzard just shouldn’t allow migration from an underpopulated factions. That would solve some of the problems.
---
I did exactly the same, and even as I lvl new char on PvE the fact that I'm leaving my beloved character behind takes fun away, used to play like an hour everyday, now I log like once every 3 days...
---
no pots. no tea unless its for gold. keke
---
It was defunct for a week or two and has been working since. Blizzard made it so that the player has to do something (click/press button, etc.) for a /who request to work so census was modified to do /who on basically any mouseclick for example when panning the camera. It's sometimes a bit sluggish but works well enough.
---
Pretty sure it's your standard pve spec, but with imp FD. So a 0/31/20 I think?
---
In combination with stuff like this, I think honorless kills should start counting against you in some way. dhks are a bit extreme, but maybe a combination of an honor bounty as well as a debuff that starts to accumulate stacks? (Like 1% less damage and 1% more damage taken or something).
---
That way, there is more of a reason for players to hunt down those preying on the lowbies and honorless. They become fat juicy stacks of honor.
---
When spamming dungeons I ran a SS/DW talent spec. You don't have Bloodthirst or MS but you generate insane burst cleave damage. Is very fun.
---
Not even a fucking announcement anywhere else, and just about the smallest timeframe given for something they KNEW people wanted.
---
Fuck you Blizzard.
---
I'm so glad I left that trainwreck of a server early
---
burning steppes ogres inside the northern cave. felwood constellas.
---
the biggest eu server is currently slightly smaller than the biggest private server was at its peak, nost/ely/lh had around 12k peaks, if you bother to check population data you will see no classic servers are this big
---
and these private servers had nowhere near the imbalance classic does
---
its almost like offering a wide range of servers and free transfer unrestricted between them fucking ruins ratios, WHO WOULDVE THOUGHT?
---
Will a post that may break someone's money making trick get downvoted to hell on this sub?
---
Bro do not trust websites like this. Blizz has intentionally crashed this addon. Just take a look at the data for Firemaw EU (the largest EU realm) - it says 10k allys 1.7k horde ROFL the hordes are like 3:1 compared to alliance (and I have 10k HKs so you can trust my estimation).
---
What I'm saying is that Blizzard caused it and are the root of the issue. Horde being toxic is just an effect of Blizzard's poor handling of phase 2.
---
MikScrollingBattleText, it's an addon that displays combat text and other things. In this case it's the numbers that you see flowing past his character. 
---
Normally, if you have MSBT, you don't need Blizzard's combat text, because this replaces it and does more, so OP having both on is just cluttering his screen.
---
&lt;De Rode Ridders&gt; is moving to Earthshaker
---
heal from crusader is big for lvl 29.
---
Wow, that's unlucky like hell, but I got you.
---
While me and the other resto have like the same (good) feral gear as our feral, I also disenchanted them once. I think I'm the only druid on the server without his T2 helmet.
---
It dropped twice for our guild, both were the only Onyxia kills I overslept/missed.
---
I am safe to get the next Wild Growth Spaulders too, but they didn't appear since our 2nd and last PuG raid, where a random got them.
---
Also, we haven't seen a single enchant formula either in like 12 IDs.
---
It's really funny how some items drop like every raid for some guilds while other guilds get a ton of different items all the time.
---
is that supposed to be the Judgement armor?! oof
---
The issue has never been the act of ganking, it's the volume. The population cap is so high that the world is packed full with people. When you have any faction imbalance then this effect is exarcebated. And as this happens, the world is no longer about any other content than pvp, which burns people out. This obviously happens to any minority faction , the players are still human. Don't shove it into one or another faction, this issue has never been about the culture of factions being too different.
---
They implemented Layering to accomodate the huge numbers of players. They thought these people would eventually leave, so they would merely need to reduce layers.
---
Implenting forced restrictions of faction balance is more than just adding layering. You go from 'alliance always ganked' to 'i'm horde and can never log on'.
---
Whatever they do, someone is going to be pissed off.
---
To be fair, the spells tool tip also says 'most attacks'. Idk why
---
of course I know how it feels (I was a warlock for 10 years in retail and now main a DH) and it is frustrating to get stunlocked but thats the one thing about rogues, its their 1 real advantage. What would a rogue do vs. most classes without stuns? Just die... But I know, thats what everyone wants because rogues are not that well liked, obviously. :)
---
Multiboxer bank party?
---
Yes. you were supposed to not grief them to the point where they stop playing. Horde on this server failed in that. Flight path camping isn't defensible.
---
Dominating the server because of Blizzard's design is one thing. Destroying the game for the other side is quite another. Short term thinking like this is why we have global warming.
---
It's still useless because of the limitations.
---
You should have rolled on PvE.
---
Is reddit even real?
---
Seriously wonder why Reddit doesn't have a competitor.
---
You went from clown who played himself to charity case, hell of a come up.
---
There's a difference between grouping up and raiding Ironforge with 40 people and sitting in Blackrock Mountain hallway as mage for hours on end and spamming arcane blast just to tag runners and get xp.
---
You have literally no sources that prove there won’t be many premades and BG players on PvE realms. PvP is a huge part in classic, as it’s pretty much the only content which you can play permanently as player. There will be enough players on PvE servers who want to do something besides raid logging. So they will go BG in their free time. Which will ultimately lead to much smaller queues for Horde as you think. 
---
It also helps that Alliance is actually the better BG faction by a long shot. It will be fine. As it always has been in Vanilla and retail.
---
This game is nothing like counter strike though. It was never intended to be a balanced pvp experience like those competitive games are. 
---
And we are talking about Blizzard here. They refused to release vanilla servers for more than a decade. And when they finally did they called people who wanted to play it tourists. How could anyone possible expect them to give a shit about world pvp balance?
---
what are the plumes used for? picked a fair few stacks up leveling last week
---
I rolled pvp server because pvping on release in 1-5 man parties was some of the most fun I’ve had.
---
Once I got to 60 it became hell. Took a 10 man leaving lakeshire together nearly 40 minutes to get into UBRS last night.
---
I hate it because it sucks. Not because you're "giefing away my gold farm secrets"
---
No RNG here, he simply used reck.
---
to put this in perspective i did AV exalted in a long weekend in vanilla
---
i actually hit rank 14 and was NOT exalted with WSG
---
Yeah, but you gotta somehow prevent your own faction from swooping in, buying out the mats and relisting them on the faction AH. Shady dealings involving low lvl druid alts on a separate account travelling to WS in the middle of the night incoming.
---
This answers your questions
---
https://shadowpanther.net/
---
as I said in another comment.  
---
You don't blame the car-dealer. You blame the man that crashes the newbought car into a house. Aka the one using the product they were sold stupidly. 
---
Players needs to stop trying to blame blizzard for their own poor decision making. Did Blizzard handle it poorly? yes.  
---
Was players forced to make use of the poor system and take it to the extreme it has become? Not at all.  
---
They could have been reasonable and kept it player-friendly on their own.
---
Start a character on a PvE realm and only log him whenever your pvp experience isn't bearable. You'll be surprised how fast you'll level it.
---
Tbh, id totally steal that chest as a hunter xD
---
Yep took me a while to find stormwind AH in classic because the entrance was different last time I played.
---
When i mentioned this here on reddit i got swarmed by horde saying the very original insults like, go back to retail or the classic 'seems like pvp happens on a pvp server'. Told them this was gonna happen, got laughed at, eho's laughing now?
---
Argent Dawn at Honored you can buy Enriched Manna Biscuits.  4410 mana and 2938 Health over 30sec.  It’s the current best in game, mage water is only 4200.
---
They’re 60s per 5 stack tho
---
Ahh wasn’t sure about flag capping but it’s still significantly less.
---
And I assume the player picked them because they know how annoying they are.
---
Thanks!!
---
The hospital staff probably thought you were in a cult or something lmao
---
This is the same thing my guild uses. 
---
The list is then uploaded to google docs and link in discord for folks to have access to view/review.
---
I did this on my troll hunter when I could still play. I died in the water before the portal and could res sickness above and outside of darnassus.
---
"Technically" they didn't, but the system is 100% geared to encourage that kind of play. So yeah they did.
---
You organize a raid as alliance, the horde organizes 2 raids...because they have twice the population. What do you do then?
---
Recklessness is like going super saiyan god mode
---
&gt;I have always believed in the unspoken rule about players who are just..fishing.
---
I'm sorry you've believed in a lie.
---
You just clear the trash back and forth and kill bosses if you're bored mostly. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up_VVZg8OfU
---
What, you want the rest of the people to team up under 60 and get farmed together? Because most 60s won't bother lol. The few that do will stop caring when they realize nobody comes to help out. I witness this shit daily on Gandling.
---
He must have had a bad week. I usually get 60-70k honor per week and im rank 5 in the middle
---
Enemy companion tooltips read as "civilian pvp." If they get cleaved will that award a DK?
---
Bloodfang and Earthfury, probably.
---
Had I been talking about Orgrimmar, that’s what I would have meant...
---
Plus his crusader procced at the right time
---
Do you vet your own sources to see that it is reporting 0 players on multiple servers and may not be accurate in the slightest?
---
Play the game twice, duh!
---
We run the dwarfs in BRD for this. 
---
Less competition and also get elemental fire for GFRP. 
---
Normally do the way leading to bar and arena area. 
---
Rogue budy solos BRD and pickpockets and loots vaults. He normally sells stacks of HO pots and Mana Pots to guildies for 2g (great deal imo since he could make more than that on AH).
---
This was bound to happen due to OP Horde racials ( pvp wise ) and Horde Shadow Priest racials. I don't blame them for rolling horde to pvp, it's the better choice. However what I blame them for ;
---
Trying to get into UBRS, I already don't have any hopes left and I'm willing to corpse-run even though it takes time, it's ok I'm used to it. But when 8-10 mages nova and kill me in 3 minutes with staves to have fun and that priest mind controlling me as soon as I res to make me walk back so I can't corpse run to the dungeon gate... Yeah I blame them for these.
---
I think it comes down to taking 1st item that is best you can get but not bis will eliminate you from getting the BiS item. At least from a loot council perspective where you want items distributed in a way that most benefits the guild.
---
I'll use staff of dominance and mageblade as an example. Mageblade is better than SoD when it comes to spellpower and PVE content. In my guild, if you get either of these weapons, there is no way you will get the other unless it's getting DE'd. This is a fair system IMO, else you're hurting your guilds overall progression if 1 player gets both while others have neither. Our guild also has a system to balance this out by time BWL comes out because players with SoD will get priority on Staff of the Shadow Flame while Mageblade users will like go without an upgrade during phase 3. Again, the mageblade user will get prio on 1handers that come in the later phases too.
---
This is the main reason why players will pass on upgrades and like me, dig their own grave waiting for something that could take months because they want the BiS item.
---
Nearly everything gets downvoted to hell here
---
tell us
---
Please use your shadow absorption spell vs locks ;/
---
I'm not sure people trying for this grind realise just how long and hard it is. Most people who did it back in vanilla say it wasn't worth it.
---
The *vast* majority of people who are pushing for the high ranks won't make it unless they're part of the groups who are playing the system as a group... which will *still* entail utterly insane amounts of time.
---
56 mage here, best places to farm gold and xp? Can't do non-instance farming on my server, too many horde
---
If you only care about PVE speedruns where every second counts you roll human warriors. APEs being all gnome says a lot about their PVP intentions - as does them being alliance.
---
Having a separate instance zone for hosting Silvermoon and etc really is what did them in. It was too much work to move BC content to Azeroth proper when Cats came out and it never got the love because of it.
---
&gt; while those same people refuse to name and shame 
---
My guildie got targets by two different CoD scammers the other day, each going for like, 300g.  Both the scammers names were like "dsfg" or something.  Obviously throwaway accounts.  Not much there to shame, ya know?
---
We are around 30, cleaned up bench and some alts.
---
Imagine if you were playing Counter-Strike, and all of the counter terrorists on your server instantly leave the match after their first death, one minute into the game.
---
If you then tell them that single player Half Life would be better suited, they claim that playing 9v10 just wasn't fair, but are really happy in their new matches where they play 8v2s.
---
Does anyone have any census numbers post fix for Noggenfogger?
---
Most players who claim that rogues are the easiest 1 button class are the same players who tell you "dUeL mE Without enGi n00b!!!!!"
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4749_Earthshaker
---
Because of the way fury works your weapon damage doesn’t matter as much as with rogues. And aged core leather gloves are better than edgemasters which give you enough for the weapon skills. Gnomes don’t get a bonus to swords like humans so they have no priority weapon. Additionally, dw fury tanking with double daggers is top threat gen under TF and anu decent sword OH.
---
Exactly. From the smallest scale (1 rogue tries to gank me and if I fight back the other 2 horde who were peaceful join in on the gank) to the largest (organize a 40 man raid to fight back and get overwhelmed by 160 horde) it just isn't fair.
---
In game death threats? Against their char?
---
My server is rather balanced. Its still a shitshow. In this experience its actually rather difficult to get enough people to counter. From what i can tell its both sides of the field too. The only time it works is preraid when everyone knows 100 percent there is going to be a solid wall of imbalance. Even then around 7 to 10% still find a way to just do whatever they want so they can afk in the middle. Its incredibly demotivating. I get it. Its a game. But the amount of bitching when no one wants to actually try is appalling. I get in a grp. Hey lets roll as a team to our instance. Met with yea ok lets do that. Nope. Still everyone tries to run ahead. Its stupid.
---
Goodluck with that on a 30-70 server.
---
Yes.
---
Im looking forward to the wand tbh.
---
Good luck seeing that done on the timeframe most trannies are expecting to see the gates open.
---
&gt;  Nothing I wrote was made up. 
---
Litterly the first sentence you wrote to me was a made up assumption, remember?
---
&gt;How about you just dont gank those neutral cities lmao. 
---
Cba to reply to the second line since the first one is already so flawed.
---
The bed made by Blizztard right? Did you actually have any idea about the lore in this game? The war going on? The PvP server you joined, willingly?   
---
Blaming other players for the complete and utter shit pulled off by Bliztardians is not cool bro. All this could of been handled day 1. Blizzfackwads never gave 2 shits about it.
---
Same here. I got a few lucky drops that I probably won't get again. And well I'm my way to pre bis abs epic mount. Also a nice stock of enchanting materials.
---
I don't want to grind for that again. And I don't want to play like a low level npc.
---
So I quit in stead.
---
Oh, I know that. I was just being pedantic, because teeeechnically you're still waiting.
---
Blood and thunder give me lumber
---
Yeah my guild left Blaumeux for Earthfury. The change has been amazing. No longer needing 10 corpse runs to make it into UBRS has been amazing.
---
Except in one special case that I know of, there may be others. Hellscream (normal) was so over populated, that they finally opened up free transfers to Dalvengyr (PvP) a newly created PVP realm, hoping some people would take the opportunity.
---
As a fellow horde I agree to the horde there did this to themselves.
---
You say it's blizzards fault, but pvp isn't corps camping both flightpaths, making it take 1hour to get into BRM, spirit healing camping.
---
Just making it purely non play able for allys just because you can and you do it so they don't want to play.
---
Yes of course you didn't hade the option of giving them a chance since blizzard forced you to do all this shit.
---
Yes it's the horde sides fault since they grief the shit outa allys. [Stupi blizzard it's their fault. ](https://i.imgur.com/QEwdCZP.jpg)
---
Yes, but exactly because of that the alliance retreats to guerilla tactics - small groups in unexpected places. Most annoying.
---
&gt; It is a ridiculous amount of hours per day, but it's a very short amount of calendar time.
---
You say that like the two aren't equally important. You're talking more than a quarter of an entire year playing a game more than you do literally anything else. More than you work, more than you sleep, more than you do any other hobby, more than spend time with friends and family. No days off. None.
---
So you can.. what? Have slightly higher numbers than someone else on a raid log for a while? Have more of an advantage at an activity you just spent months doing? Uh.. great. 
---
Consider the fact that 99.99% of people who do this grind aren't going to enjoy most of it. I'd say 100% but hey, it's possible someone will go from 0-14 and love every second of it.. but whatever. Now consider what else you could achieve in your life if you spent 12-14 hours a day dedicating yourself to something else for four months. Be it education, professional development, personal health, whatever. That kind of time can and commitment can be used for *life changing events*.
---
I knew three rank 14 players back when I played vanilla. *Every single one* did the same thing when they got there... they logged in, saw their rank, were insanely happy that it was finally over, bought all their gear and *logged the fuck out again*. Yeah of course they came back and played with the shinies, but within a few weeks one took a year long break from WoW and the other two were playing alts a lot more than their rank 14's. 
---
Look.. grind away if you want. The system is there, people know what it involves. Go for it. But please don't kid yourself with this rationalisation that it's somehow in *any way whatsoever* 'worth it' in any kind of logical sense.
---
They think it’s a nice/meme class but it would sell so many.
---
All these flavors and you have chosen to be salty.
---
You sound like PVE servers are bad by any means lol.
---
You are correct, BUT subpar DPS will help the boss out! 🤣
---
Those jolly green heros in greens and some blues might make it into group and result in not making the check.
---
Ggggggggggggggggvyh
---
Did you mean "ruin your gameplay now or don't get a chance to do it again"?
---
There was no problem until alliance created a whiny flash mob that claimed faction balance was the problem for getting ganked, while horde got ganked the exact same amount but didn't mobilize any flash mob, because dying in world-pvp is normal. Annoying, but normal.
---
But some people prefer to destroy faction balance on two servers just to feel better themselves for a limited amount of time. Give them some weeks and they will find something to blame for their failure on 80/20 favored servers.
---
Made up numbers good, alliance bad!
---
Starting to think there might not be a class for me in Classic. Rolled hunter as a main but I'm having a few doubts about how it plays in PvE. I always liked the idea of rogue but they're not that great in 1.12 and it doesn't seem like a good choice for BGs (which are a priority for me). Even though I love warriors, they are too bad solo. Played paladin for years and it was always frustrating. Don't really enjoy clothies or casters.
---
Any suggestions?
---
IB
---
fuck
---
I'm just made I didn't think of it first!
---
How do you Ret Paladins go about getting your DPS gear? I want to make one as an alt, I'm not delusional I have no grandiose desire to actually raid on it but I'd like to PvP and do Dungeons at least, but I can't get any gear. No dungeon groups will take me, and every time I try and start one myself the Warrior will always leave once he finds out I intend to roll on DPS gear and weapons.
---
I offered to heal the dungeons instead to get in but they wouldn't accept me rolling on DPS gear at all.
---
"It's useless cause i dont like it"
---
I don't know, so far Blizzard listened to whiners and forced the schedule, I am sure people with closed AQ gages will whine really hard so they will get what they want.
---
&gt; heal from crusader is big for lvl 29. 
---
This is truth.  My rogue twink (lvl 29 as well) had double crusader. Very hard to kill.
---
Or some ppl are just dicks and like to camp there. I've seen gank groups (always filthy Alliance, never seen a horde one!) camp the Hydraxian Waterlords. They're especially active before the major raiding days
---
Depending on the question. Asking them imo is rude as fuck. You see the dumbest questions coming past in general chat. Like how do I get from ironforge to stormwind. It's literally a Google search away. I would even bet 10 bucks on that Bing would even give you the awnser. 
---
Instead you're wasting people's time by having them read it. And having to respond to you.
---
Glancing blows happen regardless of level difference. 
---
But excluding glancing blows, the idea is that you can only crit if you manage to actually hit your opponent and don't glancing. And special abilities (yellow damage) can't ever glance so if you land with those they'd always crit.
---
wink doesn't have an animations attached, wave does.
---
Maybe he was the world best clicker. Clicking faster than lightning. Must suck extra to bested by someone that clicks and backpedals. 
---
Having everything keybound doesn’t automatically make you a good player.
---
If I'm running up and talking to the npc, I'm pretty sure they know what I'm doing, if not the first time, then surely after I've ressed and quickly gotten the douse from the npc at the top of the little island.
---
You might have gotten a dishonorable kill
---
That’s my warriors name haha
---
If you can get rag pre-submerge you should be ok. 
---
Its more a tank rotation/transition at that point and TPS gen that will cap the DPS.
---
My god that is upsetting to watch
---
They also refused to xfer.
---
Imagine making a comment this long about something you don't have the slightest clue about.
---
&gt; The grass is greener
---
Of course it's greener to have a 90/10 favored faction ration compared to a 40/60 ratio.
---
It doesn't change the fact that it's super weird to destroy two whole servers just by being salty.
---
I'd choose it only you have any kind of interest in RP.
---
After all it IS and *rp*-pvp server.
---
There is more horde Pvp'ing compared to alliance on Razorgore and it is not even close, horde on Razorgore are just zerging like mindless zombies all day and nothing else, 99% of the horde are not willing to take 1v1 fight and just run away cowardly so they can go back to their friends and keep zerging.
---
Better than you Alliance fight vs Horde.
---
*stun resisted*
---
Ashbringer has 30% more Horde 60s than Alliance. If you don't believe, run a census any evening of the week.
---
Clear up? No. But it will definitely reduce a lot. All the people with dreams of real PvP ranks simply CAN'T sit around in the world anymore, they will never be able to climb past like rank 6 without swapping to BG grinding instead.
---
all but 1 pvp server is horde dominated, i'd say that's way more hordes.
---
How do people move? I thought there were no transfers?
---
Plus their game is still in alpha.
---
PvP objects? Do you even silithus dust or EPL towers man, there's plenty. /s
---
Disc is more fun
---
I moved my bank alt to darnassus because grobbulus has some certain insufferable roleplayers on the IF bridge and stormwind square that I just grew exhausted of seeing 
---
No regrets, I give this man business every day
---
Quote from a vanilla rank 14 I knew: "If you love PvP, rank 10 is a great goal. If you want to hate PvP, go for rank 14".
---
I did the same thing to a bot on Mankrik day before yesterday.  It was a Hunter with a pet with a name in Chinese characters... like they don’t even try to be sneaky anymore?  I did this for about 30 minutes before the bot hearthed and logged off...I assume because of low XP/hr.
---
Please report any bot you see.  They’re helping to destroy server economies and make it very difficult for the rest of us to farm mob/herbs/ore.
---
If this actually works like he describes that would imply that the bot is literally just running the actual client and clicking on pixels / simulating button presses. That is realistically almost impossible to detect without false positives.
---
While your comment is mostly silly, the video of that funeral raid is my favorite WoW video of all time.  Over the past 10+ years I re-watch that video once or twice a year, and it makes me laugh every time.
---
My mistake!
---
haven't really but i will have a talk before id leave. its a good guild but turns out i am not really a fan of loot council as seems like feral druids have a big disadvantage of getting gear with it.
---
Isnt that little tomato a little young to join the order of the great paladin warriors?
---
I fought a fury warrior with dual  Deathbringers from Ony... his bloodthirst hit me for 1.2k... from a 1h weapon lmao.
---
Its a reddit wide rule, not just this sub.  
---
It's really, really easy to misinform other people; on purpose or not.
---
How so? The queue times for hordes are still going to be longer because there is more horde players.
---
Enjoy the dead PvE realm too!
---
It's not like you made anything better faction-ratio-wise, you just put yourself in favor. You'll feel exactly the same as the evil bad horde you were trying to punish on your old server.
---
You could take a free transfer to an ally dominated PVP server (Earthshaker) and have the same experience as you'd find on a PVE server.
---

At first I thought someone targeted you after you already fell victim and grabbed another 80g! Glad it was an act of kindness!
---
the size of the pool is irrelevant
---
Arf Arf.
---
I'm a second-string raider and happy with that position as I cannot consistently make my guild's raid nights.  I only raid when I feel like it or it is convenient for me and the guild happens to have room.  I do not roll on gear that dedicated raiders need.  And I've only cleared Rag with my guild once, most of the other times it's just been in pugs.
---
Still can on your server I guess.. Since blizz let's it happen..
---
Imagine still being this petty
---
Do you even realize how hard it is to accomplish something like this solely based on customers decisions? In a game which has been completely decoded and min-maxed  by the community that is biased about exactly that. 
---
People wont be like "oh okay so horde is objectively in PvP" but ill roll alliance to keep things balanced. That's not how decisions are made in a long term.
---
Is there a guide or a video that you could point me to?  I am interested in warlock solo farm

Don't swap.
---
Certain classes get more mileage out of some items than other classes/specs, but a good loot council will be keeping track of how much loot everyone is getting. Once the most important players have gotten what they need (mt, top 2-3 phys dps), you should be given some priority on drops you need.
---
If you swap now to a DKP guild, you're going to spend another 5-6 weeks building up DKP for just a single item. There are definitely players who will be holding DKP for non-set items that you want, knowing that they can get tier sets cheaply later.
---
just wear a helm or bucket
---
For just pure DPS the Baron cloak is better but CoSM has 12 stamina and Fire res on it so for PvP it’s better, even for a Rogue.
---
I feel like I need to open the gates of my guild to take in refugees lol
---
Yeah people got PTSD from phase 2. I usually help allys that seem to die to mobs. In phase 1 it seemed very appreciated.
---
Last night a rogue seemed to be having a tough time against a devilsaur. But as soon as i dismounted he vanished, probably thinking i was going for him.
---
Indeed, soon it will be entirely who can stay logged in the most. That really is what it comes down to.
---
&gt; This is what the min-maxers in this subreddit never seem to understand.
---
You clearly have no idea what the definition of "min-max" is.
---
It’s not as fast but they do still drop stuff plus herbs.
---
I know it will be easier for guilds that are organized. 
---
It will be a diaper flinging shit show for folks that “try hard” and dont understand mech/agro management and that get distracted easy. 
---
PUGs.... depends on the pedigree.
---
Dunno about kills for last week, but decaying by up to 10% of your total rank is normal if you don't get any significant amount of honor.
---
Alright man, you do you. It's all good. I disagree, I would NOT take Spirit Tap.  I'm betting that 999/1000 others that play or played priest wouldn't take Spirit Tap for PvP either. I think it's silly, but it's YOUR character and YOUR 15 bucks. I'm not trying to fight you, I swear. You do you, have fun. We disagree, that's OK.
---
In Vanilla they fixed that and had set dates when the gates would open automatically irrc.
---
IIRC the whole team gets rep for a cap. This also means that being stompfarmed by a premade gives no rep (aside from marks), seeing as you won't be capping flags.
---
So you’re saying you agree with me? Ok, thanks.
---
Really?  On my server the stuff is dirt cheap so I buy it in bulk and only pick it if and only if it is exactly in my path to other more valuable herbs.
---
I would disagree, plenty of people I know, myself included, are pretty much only playing classic since retail is garbage and they want classic to be successful so they role out TBC servers. I'm personally in the TBC then maybe a TBC+ camp.
---
Quite true, I'll try tonight !
---
Update: 
---
I got to lvl 14 in classic before deciding to try retail and used the booster instantly (maybe not the best idea but I used to raid and pvp a lot in gw2 so it didn't overwhelm me that much jumping to the end game).  
---
I created a druid (honestly just looked up the raid dps rankings and since druid can also heal and tank I went for it), looked up some guides and I'm currently lvl 117 doing missions, dungeons and having a lot of fun.  One thing I knew was that gear was really important but I didn't expect it to be to this degree.   
---
Also I'm interested in learning the lore, any YouTube channel you would recommend?
---
Blizzard gave horde-players the tools to make a bed.  
---
Horde-players decided to make the worst bed in the history of mankind and then complain when they have to sleep in it.
---
No one forced horde-players to take it to this extreme. No one forced horde-players to camp literally every popular/important spot in the world. No one forced horde-players to go 5v1 in every single battle.
---
Horde-players who camped needs to take responsibility for their own actions. They were not forced into this. They took PvP and went 'how can I find the most annoying, game-breaking, faction-destroying way to increase my points?'
---
im fine with the stuns. you having blind and sprint to reset fights that you can pick with stealth is not fine.
---
It isn't. But the shorter the fight is, the better it becomes compared to a straight mp5 stat.
---
Only, if you're really racing through the encounter that 300 mana is pointless anyway. And the cooldown means you won't have it on the next boss.
---
It really doesn't matter which server you'll pick, all servers will either be ex-normal servers with 0/100 ratio, because alliance instantly fled after dying twice in world-pvp, or be the newer servers, destroyed by free transfers, with 100/0 ratios, because fled alliance players now recreate the problem that made them leave their original servers.
---
I think, if you want to meet the opposing faction, PvE servers are the only way to achieve that, ironically. People are just too whiny elsewhere.
---
I've heard this before but I can't figure out how to access that functionality - in tsm's skill ui I'm only ever able to bring up the professions on the character I currently have logged in, not my others. Any ideas/guides on how to make it work?
---
to be fair, that 1h is slower than some 2h weapons.
---
At least you get expected and unexpected places. Alliance doesn't have that luxury, every inch of Azeroth is an expected place. Even in the Ironforge inn you are camped. Maybe you can survive a few minutes more right next to king Bronzebeard before the horde raid kills the guards.
---
Or to not experience a perceived imbalance. I had no problems with my pvp server all the way to p2. Then most of the content I could normally do was cut off. And people get burned out a lot faster when the only content to do is:
---
A: Play in macro pvp
---
B: Find a group and deathop 4-7 times per instance run together
---
C: Farm in protected zones with lower income
---
D: Play a stealth class
---
Honestly, you'd gain a lot from playing a 60 on the other side of the faction on the same server.
---
I'd never want to play on a PvE server, but if I had to choose between PvE and PvP but no opposing faction, I'd pick PvE. At least I'd be able to turn pvp on and organize world pvp battles. That wouldn't be possible on a PvP server with no Alliance.
---
And why would I be salty? I play on Firemaw. Horde may outnumber us but at least Alliance isn't leaving the server in droves.
---
Yeah, cz hunters make 5 times more.
---
I wouldnt label the first 2 groups as PuGs. That is more a raid team vs guild raid team. 
---
A true PuG should be an interesting shit show of a party!!!
---
Don't worry, you're just recreating the same problem on your new server, just the other way round.
---
&gt; And aged core leather gloves are better than edgemasters which give you enough for the weapon skills.
---
edgemaster is still BIS due to deathwish being BIS for fury (except human fury)
---
In vino veritas.
---
&gt; Early on you needed to keep the Rank to wear the Items, that really shows you how badly designed that System was
---
That's just not true.
---
Na man, they're refugees and don't have time to contact all their loved ones before fleeing. It's like that Hey Arnold where Mr. Huynh had to give up his daughter during the fall of Saigon. With any luck OP will be reunited with his buddies on Christmas.
---
Need to change my cannibalize icon to one of an undead drinking a cup labeled "your tears".  Cause that is what I am doing with it.
---
Alliance people always think they have it had. It’s just not the case.
---
Could be a raid leader that isn't aware of feral gearing?
---
not true
---
That is 100% true!
---
He could've used Seal of Rightousness too, as it adds its modifier to each swing (nice chunk of dmg on a slow 2h weapon)!
---
And instead letting go this 0.000001 honor, they chase him.
---
&gt;	Listen, I know it's not 'Vanilla', and the #nochanges crew gonna flame me for ruining the game with this concept... But
---
lemme stop u there
---
It really is both the most entertaining Classic goof video, and also a really great reminder of how PVPs have worked since vanilla.
---
Because yeah....
---
She Loved Fishing
---
....and PVP
---
I mean best weapons are in pvp atm until even AQ.So rewards are good.Now is it worth the time ans your life ofc isn't but streamers played 10-14h day even before p2 so there will surely be ppl going for it
---
Bloodthirst doesn't scale with weapon damage, just attack power.
---
Gonna start leveling an Orc Hunter or UD mage on EU Razorgore server today around 18:00.
---
Anyone wanna join me leveling a new main or an alt? Active and friendly player, played in vanilla also :)
---
So much better than how alliance on horde dominated servers have it, who can easily reach 30 deaths to get into BRD?
---
Nice that you're confirming Horde being the problem not faction balance.
---
Weeping silently every time I see a War with Truestrikes and I don't have mine yet =(
---
As alliance, you can farm shards in duskwood. On the west end of the zone, there is a small ghost town, use detect invisibility and there are super squishy lvl 48 mobs!
---
Playing on a PvE server =/= Not interested in PvP
---
Many players on PvE servers do, in fact, love to PvP. They just don't like suddenly getting dunked when they're out farming or trying to get to a dungeon. In fact, these players can't get their PvP fix currently, so they'll be very eager for BGs.
---
The only talents you need to train from a trainer are Faerie Fire, Insect Swarm, and Nature's Grasp. All other talents including Swiftmend and Feral Charge are active and available immediately.
---
Would it really be better if it said lanch day?
---
Was this on Grob? If it was I asked the same mage for food and then watched him auto run into a few objects, then turn, and run again like a roomba. No response either.
---
"hardest time farming" say that to healer.
---
If you are not picking this or rolling female for marge simpson hair are you even trying?
---
So the #LotsOfChangesSeeminglyAtRandom train?
---
Plot twist, HE is that guy advertising here.
---
Maybe you should report him to Twitch instead.
---
Bloodthirst is based off attack power. So weapon damage and speed shouldn't change the amount it hit you for. Granted  1.2k is a lot and he probably had both crusaders proc'd
---
While still a nice weapon, I do believe we are getting the less bullshit Unstoppable Force instead of the one with the idiotic knockback.
---
Go RPPVE if you want to fish in peace
---
The Horde have literally abused Alliance players into refusing to play or hiding.
---
It's useless because it doesn't bring out accurate data anymore.
---
Yes! There was always this unspoken rule of the sea. We are here to fish. This is the way. But now players are so honor thirsty that they are coming out to fishing areas (like bay of storms) just to gank fisherppl. Fishing is literally the only solo way as a healer that I can farm. Let me have this one fucking thing in peace.
---
In raid
---
It's already not no-changes, it stopped being no-changes at the very, very early announcement of loot trading being enabled and the fact that classic has literally 0 customer support. I would argue that this isn't a QoL upgrade, it's a major change to a major ingame system. It'd be like introducing the later kinds of raid-lockouts where you can spam MC as much as you'd like but only loot bosses once, or something. It's definitely a classic+ kind of thing rather than fixing something outdated.
---
Deathbringer*
---
Mage. There's nothing like an elemental shaman with its burst in a paladin or warlock, at least until warlocks are insane with T2.5 or T3 LOL.
---
Paladin might be fun for you though if you are OK with understanding you're an assist guy. Basically in PvP you want to follow around an MS warrior and /assist kill. Keep a freedom up, use your BoPs on caster players, cleanse like mad, sacrifice when you need to, LoH, etc.  You first priority is healing, cleansing, utility, and THEN damage last.  They you will be a great paladin and we honestly need more players like that on alliance so you're not gonna get an LOLRet out of anyone if you are doing your job like that. Paladins are FUCKING AMAZING in PvP.  Especially Holy, but don't discount Rets that know WTF is up.
---
Or Stranglethorn Vietnam
---
Give it 2 weeks. Also track progress on all realms, it's really terrifying to see how fast either:  
---
a) Alliance stops logging raids  
---
b) Alliance stops logging in
---
Fuck I want one of this. I'd love a priest one though
---
Good old Reckoning bombs :)
---
Counting worms
---
I guess it remains to be seen, huh?
---
Just to add: personally I had no opinion ir expectations back then about PvP. I was, however, open to QoL and balance changes, which were (and probably still are), of course, unpopular.
---
I will keep playing. Hopefully it gets better. I like doing BRD, but the run drains your soul and I havent done a single quest since P2 hit, because that's just impossible.
---
While I still think that Classic was a success, P2 definitely was not.
---
Is that a bathrobe?
---
Why can’t you mind your own business? Like it in no way effects you or ur ability to enjoy the game.
---
You sound mad that someone has more twitch followers than you and trying to get back at the dude for being more successful then you.
---
he should be, hes quite experienced player but it seems that we have other prios with gearing people it seems.
---
Can I reasonably heal the lvl 60 dungeons (with the exception of maybe UBRS) as a lvl 58 holy priest if I have nearly all preBIS and 320+ healing? I feel like I had way shittier gear in vanilla and was running all sorts of stuff from 55 and up with the guild, but nobody now wants a sub-60 and I've gotten literally everything there is to get from BRD. Please no more BRD.
---
Its like accepting a ride while hitchhiking. If there's a pole.....
---
Rogues bad at BGs? I have never heard this complaint. Though I'm playing a paladin through classic I played a rogue from beta to the release of WotLK. I never had any issues with BGs. I lived in them. It's not uncommon to be top in HKs and damage. They're incredible at retakes in AV. They're the reason turtle matches exist! They're great spies in AB. WSG is probably where they're at their weakest but even then you can get the drop on an enemy flag carrier when your team is pinned on defense. Rogues are one of the best classes in Bags.
---
Thanks - thought I was going crazy. Kind of wish it showed with the active buffs!
---
That's bethesda canvas bag levels of quality you got there
---
Is this Arathi Highlands? :O
---
It’s a well balanced an active server 
---
Please don’t come here and skew things is what they’re saying
---
&gt;like you can like Classic but find that honor system is stupid and PvP isn't working as it should?
---
Like what, you should people shouldn't pvp on pvp server? The situation with people camping everything was predicted even before classic launch since it was obvious and expected. People who didn't want it to happen with them rolled PVE realms from the start.
---
&gt;And ok you go away from Menethil with your 10 man anti-rogue squad... you go to BRM and there's 20 people attacking you because, as we established, your faction is underpopulated. 
---
So what? I just take more people since as you said, there are more people unhappy being ganked than people who actively gank. So we fight back by numbers. And the rogues aren't back, you said yourself they are gone. If they aren't gone, then we kill them until they are.
---
The situation "oh you know they are gone only while you are there and as soon as you aren't there, they come back" means there is OTHER group of people responsibility. Since as you said, unhappy people are majority, it's possible for another group to be formed against these rogues.
---
If your point is still reduced to "good players of one faction can make unhappy much more players from opposing faction because they are good organized group which acts accordingly, and opposing faction is a flock of sheeps who can only cry on reddit without being able to fight back" (because this is what I see from your logic, either ganker overcome "just here because they are good" or they move and gank elsewhere "because they are smart") then duh, the natural selection is at work, go be carebear on pve server, go back to retail etc. etc.
---
However, complainers were indeed countered by the very same arguments like you say. They don't like being told other faction is just more dedicated, skillful or organized than the ones who are ganked. And they rebuke it by the sheer numbers argument, the argument which I use as my cornerstone.
---
Again, make a thread with your logic of "faction imbalance isn't important since only hundreds of dedicated players create the havoc and there are thousands of you, fight back", you will see what people say to you.
---
Blizzard is the only one to blame here.
---
A large part of the #NoChanges crowd were private server players. I played on a couple myself, and I the faction imbalance was never this bad. What kind of game changes would've fixed this? Disabled/changed racials is the only thing I could think of, but that would already be too much imo.
---
Faction queues at release would've been a good start in my opinion. This has been proven to work in the past.
---
Loot council sucks it just means “we feed gear to our friends”. At that rate you are better off doing pugs with free roll. Talk to the gm about it.
---
cant believe u just called xn a mage
---
I see a lot of warriors doing that on my server. Offer a free spot for a shaman with WF and heals and you’ll never have to stop pulling.
---
DKP and my Casual Guild. Long post sorry. 
---
My Guild transitioned to DKP system (CEPGP) and pugging wasn't needed. It's been MS &gt; OS, non 60s cant get gear that a 60 wants, but we're discussing the rules now. We're pretty casual and you can main what you want, we've had multiple boomies in raid at a time before and it's not uncommon to have multiple non60s and people that have never seen a raid or MC. 
---
So my question, we have people that have attended and have built up DKP, but dont entirely get to spend it on w/e they want. Am I crazy for thinking that a tank druid with a bunch of DKP should be able to get the t2 helm to build their offspec or mostly do w/e they want with dkp, rather than watch the next 5 helms go to the myraid of restos that play for 2 weeks and quit? Or the 5th holy priest should be able to go on their rogue as they're bored 10 healing without a penalty?
---
I get not wanting to flip the raid balance/roles on it's head, loot sitting on a alt/bag "rotting", and not the raid as geared for progression as possible, but if someone made the dkp to buy an item and that's what they want to do shouldn't they be able to? Wouldn't that be the actual way to incentive attendance?  
---
TLDR: Shouldn't DKP be used on w/e you see fit in a casual guild?
---
Corrupted blood was the bigger issue because it would wipe out entire cities.
---
But have you /wave?
---
&gt; Patch 2.0.1 (05-Dec-2006): There are now different versions of this spell for different classes.

---
This will die down eventually. People are just in a mad dash to rank up and get honor. Once Bg's open up should start to get more reasonable.
---
^ This.
---
People who go hard on Vanilla´s PvP system are some of the most mentally-stunted unfortunate people around. Even Swifty is a complete boomer showing no mechanical skill whatsoever beyond clicking a macro button, no offense he´s a seemingly nice guy but a pretty good example of these "PvP gods".
---
The system only appeals to people who love to zerg mindlessly and are capable of doing so for extended periods of time with nothing to lose in their life. I feel sad for people who have waited 15 years so they can get back to "hardcore PvPing" in vanilla, the one time they´ve felt good about their "achievements".
---
You can sell services for subscriptions, yes. It is only against Twitch TOS to sell services for bits.
---
I'm not familiar with WoW TOS to speak on their rules. Contact a GM and link the stream, although they do 'claim' to not use videos as evidence.
---
You cannot put a faction based transfer on a balanced servers and imbalanced servers have been given it anyway.
---
Right, separate from old world. Couldn't fuss with it while also fussing over the remake of Azeroth. Sorry it wasn't clearly stated enough.
---
The Horde have abused Alliance players either into "not playing" or "running and hiding" -- its unplayable. Cant imagine its fun when there's no more lambs to slaughter.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e6hmy1/starting_from_lvl_1_on_razorgore_eu_horde_anyone/).
---
Base melee attack power [only](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20572/blood-fury#comments) in classic. In later expansions it's different.
---
Man, it's like you're intentionally misunderstanding him huh? Is that fun for you?
---
Stunlock isn't a single advantage, it's multiple skills that all do the same thing that can be used together or separately every what 15 seconds? Or less based on which skill?
---
I have mine I’d love to sell. Tried it on and I was swimming in it never used besides that. Sitting in my closet for 5 years.
---
It'll just cause the horde to transfer to a horde dominated server, this "solution" causes 2 dead servers instead of 1...
---
The former.
---
yeah its pretty much necessary to have those get of jail for free cards against other twinks.
---
Damn, jealous.    Anyone doing this on Skeram-Horde?   Asking for a friend.
---
Frankly, the only way I'd accept a loot council is if the had a spreadsheet of some kind that listed *every* drop from the raids and had in order, who would get the next one of those drops. 
---
That way everyone can see the loot prio and question why the brand new guy gets the Ony Head before you raid it. 
---
So yeah, I prefer dkp with 20% degredation every week. Thus it installs a soft cap on the amount of dkp you can farm. In conjuction, dkp prices of all gear is 30% your current dkp a minimum.
---
Example. 
---
Player 1 has 100 dkp. He must at least pay 30 dkp for the gear. Though he may bid up to 100.
---
Player 2 has 200 dkp, he must pay 60 dkp for the gear, but he may bet up 200. 
---
Keeps people from farming dkp, and makes it so that if they do, they still arent holding all the cards after they won loot.
---
I have heard complaints and predictions about flasks reaching 350 gold or so.
---
as a rogue i love that warriors wear so much leather and mail
---
makes them a lot easier to kill in PVP
---
Dm n tribute runs might be useless in future as ppl will just gear up through mc when a lot of the raid is almost full bis
---
And when it moves to Silithus.... Horde have TB right there. Fun times!
---
This is the most frustrating part of all of this. People keep on misreading the complaints, and somehow deriving it to part of the culture of gaming from one specific faction..
---
My success in life, work and love would suggest otherwise...but sure, judge me by the comments I make on an internet forum.
---
Gonna start leveling a HORDE Hunter or mage on EU Razorgore server today around 18:00.
---
Wanna join me leveling a new main or an alt? Active and friendly player, played in vanilla also :)
---
Unfortunately, the nochanges crew still brigade downvote sensible things. Oh well.
---
Blame the players for wanting to improve their own playing experience. Your so delusional it hurts.
---
The mods only delete low effort memes if they don’t like them. Otherwise they let them through. Especially if it bashes alliance
---
On nost they hovered around 100g, it had like 10k plays at peak times so ide assume it would be similar to that. Grobs black lotus are still at 50g
---
I certainly remember most horde saying "just quit" "reroll pve" "go back to retail". So when ally took the advice, suddenly hordes are the victims?
---
Holy shit ITT OP cries about being less popular on twitch than a dude selling a gambling service. This guy isn’t a “gold seller” in the traditional/chinese farmer sense. You’re a goddamn crybaby.
---
By default damage numbers show up above the target you deal damage to. Here's an example: https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok?t=157
---
This is true.... Wife and I spared a Night elf hunter. Pulled mob of 3. I (Warrior died) Wife lived and was gonna rez me after she killed rest. Jumpped her right as she killed last mob. Had no mana and only half health as a priest. No chance at winning that fight for her. So next thing we did is found her and killed her 5 times by camping her till she resurrected at spirit healer.
---
There are more mobs in azsahra than the demons... ANd its the byfar most calm zone when it comes to ganking.
---
Yeah, when I saw the title, my first reaction was "Um, step 1: reroll" hehe
---
What makes classic different from any other wow expansion? Every single expansion invalidated all the content of the one before and made most of the gear worthless. After TBC, you could be sure a new expansion was coming every roughly 2 years.
---
so unless, you only played WoW for a single expansion/vanilla only, you will have experienced the same thing before.
---
They switch to the corresponding class.  Obviously Blizzard would have to do some specific tweaking for that situation, but it's not remotely insurmountable.  Classic is built on the Retail infrastructure, so they could very easily accommodate this sort of thing.
---
wussys
---
You should photoshop wow onto the monitor screen behind you in pic 2.
---
That’s only a solution for alliance. If Horde is stuck in a carebear queue every evening then they want to reroll or change. Same issue but a different POV.
---
You just Shot yourself in the knee they give no honor for 30 seconds u moron... on top ccing someone for 30s Before you kill him will probably Result in the Person transferring Server even sooner
---
Blizz really needs to announce their future plans for this game...almost every game has an ending look at call of duty that you reset every 1 year
---
Yeah, at least add a really long line of people waiting as Horde after BGs release
---
Faction changes/race changes are stupid services that shouldn’t ever exist. You picked horde? You’re horde. You rolled an Orc? That character should forever remain an Orc.
---
\#nochanges might be the problem but Blizzard should have some responsibility to foresee issues that are heavily damaging to the community and come up with some solutions.
---
Right now their solution has been to reactively trap outnumbered faction players on a server... because they didn't take any proactive steps whatsoever.
---
You're the type of person that completely wipes the monopoly board after getting behind too, right?
---
Because destroying the fun for everybody is still more fun than see others having more fun than you.
---
Classic been out for a couple months now. If you are in for the long run (aka plan to play all phases / wait to see what will happen next) reroll seems a small sacrifice to do for your general.enjoying for the months / years to come. Waiting for Blizzard to do something might be extremely frustrating and they will most likely open transfer from shit realm A, B, C, D to shit realm E.
---
That being that it sucks though.
---
Screw the lowbies.  Slow people are entitled in general.  They log on, play inefficiently, waste time doing dumb stuff that's "fun" for them.  Then scratch their head when no 60s want to help them kill a random rare spawn or usher them through RFK.  Sorry bro, were are in MC.  And when we are done MC, the rogues still need the Barron cloak so we are farming UD strat.  Good luck doing what all of us already did.
---
I hate the slow levelers in my guild.  We all got to 60 without the help of 60s.  I don't see those level 35s coming to run me through RFC on my alt...nor would I ask for trivial help on my alt. 
---
I only help the core raid team with main set gear.  I expect nothing except straight boss loot from the guild for DKP.  I don't ask for enchants or crafters.  Source all my own raid materials, tip people to craft the stuff i need.  I need 39 other jabronis to help kill the bosses, that's the only thing I can't do alone.  So those are the 39 people I'm willing to help with their raid gear. 
---
By doing this you form bonds with like minded and like gear players.  These are the people you goof around with between raid content, that you develop PVP teams with, and who will continue to log on.
---
Well I didn’t fish for two year, you know, just to be on the safe side.
---
Taste. Paladins.
---
pick one.
---
The populations are "skewed" because the type of person who wanted to run around doing max pvp grinds rolled horde for the pvp racials.
---
The world pvp that is glaringly uneven across even balanced servers is a result of the min/max meta.
---
15years ago people played races cause they were cool and liked them. Now pve raiders went alliance and pvp raiders went horde.
---
Ding ding ding
---
You can totally twink and be fine without it. Taking part in BGs is perfectly possible. But it's definitely BiS for every twink.
---
I'm a troll hunter with Rhok'delar that benefits from the +5 bow skills.  This brings down the amount of hit I need from 9% to 6%.  In a perfect scenario I'm going to get +5 hit from my BiS gear (T1 shoulders \[1\], T1 gloves \[2\], Onyxia neck \[1\], and Tarnished Elven/Don Julios \[1\]).  My other ring is Painweavers, but I have a second Tarnished Elven to get to the necessary 6% hit.
---
So my question is about the scope I should use on Rhok.  The Biznicks Scope \[3% hit\] is overkill since I really only need 1% hit to keep painweaver equipped.  So is it more beneficial to use a second Tarnished Elven Ring + Sniper Scope, or should I keep Painweaver and spring for the 3% hit Biznicks scope?
---
You are right one is overall one is per fight. I prefer details as a damage meter but it do not like the way it does overall in raids as it likes to split overall up constantly. So for overall I use recount if that makes sense.
---
Racials...

I did use glider way back in the day because I worked full time and was going to uni. Glider was extremely sophisticated, and could be programmed to seem almost like a person playing.  I have no interest in trying whatever bots are out there now, but they seem like absolute twaddle in comparison.
---
yeah i am mostly dps and i am running mc with all kind of potions and food, will get DM N tribute buffs before every raid  for couple first bosses, bring 10 pummelers to raid and will be on dps charts at 5-10th place usually. Last raid i did 5th place dps at rag, top 2 of all physical dps.

&gt;Meanwhile changing the PvP system hurts nobody, it makes the game healthier in virtually every aspect. It's only the #nochanges crowd that would object, but fact of the matter is, the current system is shit for both casuals (can't ever rank up) and hardcore players (no skill, just a braindead grind).
---
Makes the game healthy? You're arguing based on a term that has no definition. Do you take extract blood samples from the virtual servers to determine the health of the game or how does that work exactly?
---
The objective for the release of this product was to recreate the game as best as possible with the tiny amount of resource J.A. Brack is willing to part with, and their now obliterated customer service department. Changing the honor system would make it a completely different game in terms of PvP, a much more massive change than any of the loot-sharing esque crap we're dealing with now. It also costs so many developer resources it's a naive pipe-dream to think there was ever a change it'd get changed. Meanwhile updating MC is a question of tweaking values, not redesigning an entire ingame system from the ground up to work in a completely different way. Much more realistic to ask for in terms of resources, and a lot easier to undo/tweak after it's been implemented in case players hate it.
---
""""healthy""""" or no, just like all of us who are mindlessly bored farming MC which has 0 challenge unless you're a 20man raid of naked level 55's, you just gotta suck it up buttercup. 
---
I had 13 days /played at 59 btw and I gave up on preraid BiS so can't really call me one of those super grindy types you blame for your trouble with MC.
---
Use ironforge.pro they take data from raid logs so that's the best and most realistic source of data we have
---
That’s only true in PvE. In pvp, you can’t get glancing or crushing blows because weapon hits are calculated at max weapon and defense skill for your level. If you’re both the same level, glancing and crushing blows are impossible. Defense skill in pvp only lowers the chance you will be crit. 
---
This is also true for pve, but Boss-type enemies calculate their defense in strange ways, so you can never get your weapon skill high enough to avoid glancing blows entirely and players can never deal crushing blows, but it has little or no effect on crit rating.

Does watching many WoW Classic videos on YT prior to playing it ruin the experience of the game?  
---
I haven't played even 1 hour, but I've watched numerous videos on YT...
---
“Don’t”
---
Look up that shadow priest Advertise guy. That's how I imagine all these UD gankers. Talking through their nose and are slightly mentally challenged.
---
Warriors are so fucking strong in Classic it almost makes me regret rolling Rogue. *Almost*. Stealth is such a game changer especially as Alliance on a PvP server, it’s really made the game a lot more enjoyable for me as I can counter play around deathballs and have a much easier time getting into instances. 
---
It’s rough though seeing warriors consistently smash me on the meters in MC with the exception of a couple fights, though. Just such good, consistent DPS.
---
I don't know, if you look at her stat sheet he has 18 charisma. That's all a paladin needs.
---
I killed a shaman. Let him Rez and drink to full so we could fight again. He wins the second fight. Ofcourse when I Rez he just charges me, no honor smh.
---
WTS 50x flask of the titans. ONLY 5k GOLD! #BLACKFRIDAY SALE!
---
they cant kill you unless you turn pvp on. i walk past horde all the time and nothing happens
---
lmao without enough alliance playing to give materials, theyll never open the gates
---
I got a warning from a GM for gift-wrap cod scamming in vanilla, so at least back then it wasn't allowed.
---
Shit like this is why Warrior got hit super hard with the nerf bat during the beta, and warriors still hit like busses made of biceps.  If they didnt nerf warriors way back then raids would be mostly warriors (tanks and dps) with a few healers sprinkled in, their damage was insane.
---
\#nochanges did not win. You can't blame #nochanges crowd for blizzard envisioning world pvp on pvp realms. You chose to roll on pvp, get over it. You gave consent for this style of gameplay the second you rolled on a pvp server. What more does blizzard need to do for you? They already created an entire set of servers specificly for ppl who don't want to be subject to constant world pvp.
---
Whenever I know I can reach a low hp % and survive it.
---
Easy example is right after an Ony breath, she generally combos it with a swipe and I drop to like 40%.
---
Partially looting a chest sets it on a despawn timer. This also means that many of the *"bad chest loot means someone took the good stuff"* claims are false.
---
a rogue can literally get off a 50 second stun lock, not sure what kind of skill that takes
---
Unit Frames are shadowed unit frames. Bars are bartender. Then just a bunch of other addons I like.
---
Ah so AV mount is 640?
---
This is why you don't Dual Wield for PvP

That's a classic, man that takes me back lol

Zandalar is barely an RP server, so it wouldn't change much,
---
Join a big pvp groupe, and only do soun drain so u get all those shard + little honor
---
Ah dang.. probably what happened. Especially when I only had 15 kills for the week, probably more noticeable
---
Wait what, they just pay the opposing faction to be camped?
---
PvE realms weren't mixed with PvP realms in the original cross-realm BGs.
---
Gonna start leveling an Orc Hunter or UD mage on EU Razorgore PVP server today around 18:00.
---
Honest question; How do you know?
---
Ouch, burn.
---
Yes, with discounts (800 originally but ofc you'll always be exalted and most likely rank 3 by the time you can buy it).
---
But people upvote the posts and comments, so they must be true!
---
It’s war. Kill or be killed.
---
No wonder I'm having so much trouble finding a fight, y'all are just opting out. Sad really, wpvp should be fun.
---
It may have been only partially looted and then it despawned a few minutes later.
---
so what are the horde planning to do? they cant properly play on a server thats 90/10, and possibly getting into AQ super late if alliance cant submit the materials for their war effort
---
He got ganked by a rogue and now he's salty.
---
The debuff was meant to discourage camping flightpaths and other like locations for honor. Cc’ing someone isn’t waiting it out. 
---
Either way, I don’t think it matters. People who are just honor farming, and not griefing will be in BG’s in a few days instead of desperately finding honor where they can. And griefers don’t care if they get an HK or not.
---
Go watch some of the top tier players play. Perplexity has some good PvP videos. If you think rogue is all about "a 50 second stun lock" then you have a lot to learn about PvP.
---
That's like saying "mage can perma kite warriors with nothing but rank 1 frostbolt, so mage takes no skill"
---
I farm DM:N once a day to fill up on shards. Between the bugs and the dogs around the first boss I can get 30-40.
---
You don’t need great gear because ideally you never get hit, you just need to know the timing and at least 1 shard to start with to distract the first bug group with a voidwalker While you run to the safe spot.
---
Wack
---
Vanilla didn't mix PvE and PvP. You didn't play back then, so it's an easy thing to miss, I understand.
---
Yeah everyone made fun of people zerging to 60...this was why we did it. Sucks man. :(
---
Game needs more people like you tbh. I'm really trying to temper my guilds expectations because everyone seems to be thinking that getting the full blue set is gonna be no biggie, but I'm not setting an example the same way so people just kinda brush it off. At least no one is harping about going for R13/14.. yet.
---
Nope :) your vanilla feeling is how I feel about Classic.
---
Why nobody watches my classic [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD8xFMQhRsc)? :(
---
I mean, sure, but it's something that can replaced with items.
---
It's also not very useful when you know that all tanks aim for a Thunderfury in the long run.
---
Those claims don't have to be false, could be that they looted it within the despawn timer...
---
Idk I've used this ui for years and I am used to it and it gives me all the information I want. To each their own.
---
If you do the escort at the end a couple more pop up
---
The game rewards them for camping every popular place. What do you mean.
---
Mine is backed on private server play. People will BG at first but still WPVP. After the initial drop, people will mostly do BG’s on their dedicated weekend and once exalted, they will stop playing them. People will still be kill on site when ran into each other. Vanilla is not classic. Open your eyes
---
There are so many little things you can't glean from a video.
---
Umadbro?
---
M. Might is worse than bone biter and WW axe because it has a low damage range. Means lower MS and HS and cleave hits/crits. 
---
In short MM gives more white damage and less yellow damage, but so much less yellow damage that it’s not worth it. 
---
FYI people sometime says slow weapons are better all other things equal. That is true, but all other things are rarely equal. The right guideline when leveling is “high damage range weapons are better”.
---
Don't forget he's Enraged as well, that's an extra *25%* DMG
---
I wasn't trying to invoke sympathy, since I'm well aware that it's my own decision.
---
Just wanted to make my circumstances clear
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but that much of a level difference doesn’t give honor, right?
---
Honestly think im just going to quit PvPing, reddit is obviously the supreme place to farm salty alliance tears.
---
Game is dying, it's time to move on.
---
someones salty
---
I think it will calm down once bgs are out
---
This is why Blizzard disabled the /who feature for Census mods. People were getting incomplete data and uploading it which caused people to panic off the hop, then lead to massive server imbalances and people freaking out. It's half the reason some servers are dead while others still have massive ques because people panicked and didn't want to chance playing on a "dead" server.
---
Yeah, set a minimum, so they'd have to attend at least a few raids before being able to roll. So what happens is that if there are no regular MS guys, then OS roll, if there are none of those - then it's a free roll for MS without DKP minimum, lastly you have OS without minimum DKP roll.
---
The hashtag is very appropriate
---
This is the case with any wow expansion.
---
In the end your gear will become irrelevant, but the moments leading up to it is why we keep coming back for more.
---
Why would a warrior want to be a rogue? Rogues are just worse warriors.
---
I appreciate your ‘enjoy the game’ line but I think differently about polls. They are probably not widely inaccurate, from discord polls, to apps, to general feel, server pops do decently align  amongst multiple categories. I’m not saying they are down to exact percent, they give you an idea, like polls do. Even if the margin of error was 5-10 percent you still get an idea. People aren’t quitting because of a poll, they are quitting because of imbalance and not being able stomp world bosses and at wpvp. But hey that’s just my opinion.
---
It’s not an honorable kill.
---
Of course almost all the blame lays with blizzard for sitting by and doing very little to help healthy faction split numbers.
---
But it was obvious Alliance were eventually going to tire of being pinatas anytime they tried to do anything in the open world almost immediately
---
level 17 horde in Duskwood? Were they heading to Deadmines or something? Because jumping off the Zeppelin and swimming is the correct way.
---
This not a Classic phenomenon, this is not a WoW phenomenon, this is not a gaming phenomenon.
---
 This is not a phenomenon bound to your hobby, culture, generation or even your species.
---
Hell, an animal doesn't even need to be social to be a moocher if you let them get away with it.
---
This is simply something most living things do.
---
The fact that you don't like it comes from your cultural values. The fact that they're doing it is simply a fact of nature.
---
He had Fel Dom up and could have summoned a pet in .5 secs before he opened the chest.  
---
He lost it because he seriously screwed up, not because of anything the rogue did.
---
"Dont ask, just say"
---
Key here
---
You can always try to `/beg` for your life.
---
This sounds pretty fucking accurate tbh.
---
The problem with banning bots as soon as they’re spotted is it tells the bot maker exactly what’s wrong with the version of the bot, so they can fix it to make it even more undetectable, so if blizz bans them in waves every 3-4 weeks or so (maybe more) it’ll take longer for the bot maker to make a working bot that won’t get swept up
---
Same problem jamflex has over on /r/2007scape
---
This is why mega servers exist and why anyone complaining about them is an idiot.
---
It would be nice if you could give credit next time. You know exactly what you did. :D
---
Yes. They were going to let us trade those ourselves but the #nochanges crew got super pissed about it.
---
So Blizz’s response was to say “ok, well, you’re on your own then.”
---
Well your last statement is true. Mage are overpowered in classic and that's well known. Especially against warriors.
---
A mage can perfect a warrior 80% of the time (both being equal skill) Like, easy fucking peasy.
---
they did.
---
I transfered from PVP to PVE in classic after i hit rank 14 and just wanted to raid 
---
they allowed PVE-PVP sometime later (wrath i think)
---
not to advocate account sharing, but I think this is the way to go.
---
you're living in a target rich environment.
---
I guess it can still work for non-Druids but our one aoe move doesn’t damage them
---
Absolutely, also it depends on how geared are your teammates, especially tank. Most people farming dungeons right now are pretty much geared and only want one or two things from a dungeon, you will be totally fine.
---
looks like form nowhere
---
the mount should cost 640 as far as i know
---
560 should not be correct
---
OMG WHO THIS.
---
I rolled on a pve server and there is no pvp here and its BS. Blizzard NEEDS to add PvP to these servers or its total BS!! I have no intention on ever rolling on a pvp server, so blizzard NEEDS to accommodate me, and my preferences!
---
This is what you all sound like.
---
I actually rolled on a pvp server for world pvp. I'm am enjoying p2 very much. I do think its crazy they released honor without BG's, but whatever. I still get to play how I want, and ppl who rolled on the wrong server type do not deserve to dictate how pvp works on pvp servers.
---
Both statements are true. Rogue is one of the higher skill-cap classes in Classic.
---
I’m gonna completely disagree with this statement. The game has evolved since we first played it and had your mindset about leather being for rogues, cloth for priests, etc.
---
The developers might have shared your point of view (as well did I), but things have changed. Through statistical analysis we now know that in fact plenty of leather is amazing and best in slot for plate wearers as is cloth for mail/leather wearers. Hell, I know an enhance shaman tank that claims Staff of Dominance is BiS for him.
---
I don’t think it’s wise of you to suggest people not to roll on it because it doesn’t have the most armor available for a dps or tank. If warriors got a bonus for wearing full plate, I’d be more likely to agree with you but numbers talk more than personal bias.
---
Explain?
---
&gt; Throw in some morons in the middle that blame Blizzard for fuck knows what.
---
what they are blaming blizzard for is the fact they can see real time numbers on balance and can lock character creation of a certain faction as well as being able to manage the transfers, for example the situation is swapped on EU Zandalar tribe, we have about a 80:20 split in favour of the alliance where as you have it in favour of the horde, yet they are allowing horde to transfer off when they should be letting horde transfer in and alliance off until there is a closer balance, i understand this takes a lot more management that just turning on transfers but when people are paying for a game then you should be putting in the effort.
---
ultimately you are right though most of the blame is on the #nochange crowd thinking that blizz could release the game as it was and it be the same as it was.
---
You should thank the private server community that classic even exists lmao
---
Its just a shame. I love Holy Pally, both the fantasy and the playstyle tbh, but I want to wear plate and a weapon and shield. Not look like a fucking clown in a gown with a glowy offhand. So I get how Classic itemization had some positives, but also..it totally destroyed any real RPG/Class Fantasy feeling. Which to some means nothing, people go through the game not giving a fuck about literally any lore/story elements, but thats not everyone
---
Don’t hate the player, hate the game.
---
I am a 100% sure that, if for some reason Alliance was the dominant faction, the situation would be the exact same. It’s not about factions, it’s just about player mentality. 
---
Servers are 3x more populated now than they were in Vanilla, and nearly every player now knows what’s the meta, and they want everything easy and quick. Turns out camping flightpoints is easy honor, so have no doubt that Alliance would camp them if we had the power. 
---
And players were indirectly “forced” to do this, since it’s way more easy to get honor by killing people in 10v1s at a flightpoint than going solo in the open world fighting 60s one by one. It’s just how Blizzard made the game. It’s really simple: If you can’t predict players’ behaviour, always assume that they’ll take the easiest (and usually most game-breaking) route to achieve things. Sadly they thought Phase 2 was going to be an alll-out war with both factions fighting fairly and equally, but turns out things aren’t as pretty.
---
It's quite a simple solution, multiple servers share a name pool, if/when the time comes to merge servers they merge without conflict.
---
Yeah its great fun getting mowed down by a zerg of horde or insta killed after landing at thorium point. great world pvp!
---
I was shocked when I heard they were gonna bring back the original honor system, because it's utterly skilless, only rewards grind, and is such a cruel grind it's downright unethical. Almost every R14 player I knew burned out and quit after. 
---
Anyway, this isn't because of NoChanges, mostly. People did then what they're doing now, this is because of the much, much, MUCH higher server populations.
---
Nothing can be more realistic than pvp bracket sizes at the end of the week.
---
paid transfers existed in vanilla
---
so no changes supports paid transfers
---
Not sure if I would call global 5v1 corpse camping a fight or fun
---
These always look nice as screenshots but playing with those reshade tweaks sucks ass.
---
They'll have about 100 people to farm HKs, not sure I'd count that a win.
---
The censuses are not accurate.
---
Im so glad that despite warrior being one of the most, if not the most popular class there is always a possibilty to stand out because most are crabwarriors like this guy.
---
I do think you get CD for 1s
---
Last set of hand ins i did around 04:00 ST.
---
This was roughly 23:00 ST and only the one mage lurking. I was very surprised myself.
---
 That's rose tinted. 
---
The original WoW forums were full of complaints that there was nothing for a "casual" player to do. You had PvP and you had raiding, both were hardcore. 
---
That's why T0.5 even exists.
---
I've never killed a raid boss with a 166 Shadow Word: Pain tick, guess there's a first time for everything.
---
I don't know what he was doing.
---
All I know is that the scumbag thought he could violate alliance borders and get away with it, well. Not on my fucking watch.
---
Use biznick since It's a pretty unique Hunter perk and get other offensive stats elsewhere.
---
that doesn't mean that faction queues and other suggestions dont work though, your completely wrong and have no idea what your talking about
---
True legend
---
&gt; Everyone gets camped at the end of the day. 
---
Your lying skill is higher than your pvp skill.
---
Blowing through it easy as in pulling each pack and CCing, or cleaving it down? What was your group composition and how efficient were the damage dealers? Were they holding back on threat a lot, and if not- do you have data to support them going hard the entire time? 
---
Not doubting the massive utility a melee-range shaman can bring to a UD Strat Group. Grounding shadow bolts from Baron, Frost Tombs, tremors, cleansing totems, and possibly some of the best interrupting in a 5-man.
---
Yeah I can holy nova down multiple packs at one so it’s pretty quick for me. My only other option as priest is princess farming but I never ran it leveling and don’t have the teleport key thing.
---
70:30 “but not too ally favored” a more than 2:1 ratio is not too ally favored?
---
Lol sitting makes you get crit that's why all 5 crit you
---
Are there any items that can remove disease effects other than Jungle Remedy, Purification Potion, and Restorative Potion?
---
The thing I fucking hated was when that #nochanges would use the slippery slope fallacy even for simple shit like flight pathing and mounting, it's stupid that we have to make macros or download add ons just to compensate for the latter
---
If it makes you feel better my horde dominated server takes 25mins to get into dire maul. They camp the path from the horde camp all the way to the bridge, also camp out inside of dm around corners.
---
Oh no did your feelings get hurt in a video game?
---
already an emote for that, /kneel and off with ya head.
---
&gt; hallway as mage for hours on end and **spamming arcane blast** just to tag runners and get xp.
---
facepalm
---
Rest in piss flamelash, you will not be missed.
---
&gt;Flamelash was 60/40 which is basically unplayable from the outset.
---
Which other balance do you expect from the game with 15 years old rules, better pvp racials for one faction (wpvp) and better class for organized pvp  like BGs for another one? Of course the balance was expected to be driven to horde on pvp realms and to alliance on pve realms, in other news water is wet and fire burns.
---
Rolling alliance on pvp server without any intention to play as guerilla corp is beyond dumb.
---
Alliance are equally bad. You have had death squads running around from the start but in the end Horde are simply bigger. Yoy failed to do what we did because you were outnumbered. Stop sitting on that high horde thinking you're any different.
---
„Guy, you wouldnt believe it. I just got attacked on a pvp Server!“
---
Alliance own feralas btw
---
Yes they can. And they do.
---
But tributes are much more gold.
---
It can only scan once every 20-30 seconds and has no way to ensure it only gets unique results per scan.
---
For it to function even remotely decent now, tons of people need to be scanning, but usually it's just 1-3 per server.
---
God I love recklessness !
---
So what your saying is build a wall and make the horde pay for it?
---
I beg and kneel and cower in fear but to no avail.
---
There so many people in every game base that are like you.  "It's a dying game, move on", what do you do, buy a new game every 30 days?
---
kill them all
---
Just like I said at the beginning of the thread, in other words, faction based transfer is bad. Ok.
---
Yeah this dude does not even need to play the game like traditional farmers!
---
Except the usual BRD Corpserunning and Certain Flight Paths being camped into submission.
---
It's nice to see the Alliance squads rear up and fight back well though. Just think like most servers Horde Pop is higher so they have more spread compared to Ally
---
I’ve had people help me throughout the game that I’ve added but haven’t talked to in a while. I like to randomly message them and remind them that they’re awesome. They seem to appreciate it.
---
BGs will achieve two things:  
---
kill world pvp  
---
reduce horde player numbers  
---
win-win
---
ive said this before
---
there are 5x the amount of PVP servers vs PVE servers, massive queues existed for the first 2 months and people just wanted to play. this is not exactly hard to figure out
---
Nightfall when its available.
---
&gt;what TSM does
---
* Make big promises 
---
* Perform for half the split
---
* Choke
---
* Still beat most of NA
---
And then either
---
* Fail to qualify for Worlds regardless, or
---
* Fail to get out of Worlds groups 
---
Generally
---
That’s absolutely reasonable to say, as an undead rogue
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4716_Arcanite%20Reaper
---
Arcanite Reaper is one of the smallest realms in the game, although the population imbalance seems to be leveling out.... its 70:30 Alliance/Horde, used to be well over 80:20
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4732_Heartseeker
---
Heartseeker has almost 3x as many people playing on it population wise, but the faction imbalance is bad. 80:20 on a good day.
---
The gold made is from vensoring the items. Escorting people for chest is additional.
---
With a lot of ways to farm gold out of thin air established I expect the inflation to be heavy indeed.
---
I'm sure there are enough tryhard nolifers over there to pay for 2nd accounts and level up alliance toons to turn in mats for the war effort.
---
In in firemaw too, and its possibly one of the most balanced pvp servers. But its still beyond frustrating getting into brm without a raid.
---
"Reeeeeeeeee MOOOOM BLIZZARD LET THE ALLIANCE MOVE SERVERS, AND NOE I DONT GET TO FIGHT 20VS1 AT THR FLIGHTPOINTS AND GRAVEYARDS ANYMORE!!! AND IF I TRANSFER IT MIGHT BE A FAIR FIGHT! REEEEEEEEE"
---
We're talking about the companions specifically dude
---
Any dedicated PvE player will still be ranking as the PvP gear is superior for raiding all the way through p6
---
Get outta here with your naturo ninja shit
---
Casual was basically a synonym for bad back then. No idea what those players were doing. Must have been playing one handed or something. 
---
Be it as it may they still logged in and dicked around in ironforge gladly for 2 years like the rest of us in our epic chat room.
---
I am lamenting the same thing as you man. I want even fights...
---
My issue with it is that they always helped in these situations during vanilla. Now they just regurgitate the same line of "it's not policy now nor has it ever been to get involved in these situations". 
---
People scamming mats, cod scams, etc were always punished and the items restored. Now they refuse. While some of these can be avoided, some cant as you would have to miss out on a lot of the game. There is no excuse not to provide the service anymore except for being lazy and not wanting to put the man hours into it.
---
I'd be very surprised if that were the case. I think Alliance would turn into the majority pvp faction. Didn't they change racials at some point in retail? Did that have any noticable effects?
---
Not trying to talk shit here by the way just trying to have a discussion and offering some different viewpoints.
---
Recklessness and it's a beast, arena 2v2 in the day if you set up the right macro you could ruin a lot of people very quick before they could react.
---
Can anyone give tips on the silithis demon. Last one and I'm struggling with it. Is there a way to do it without a lock?
---
Accurascope
---
Gear for a Rag weapon. In your case, PUG looks like the way to go, and PUG usually don't need tanks.
---
I'd say gear plate fury, enter MC/Ony as a subpar Fury you'll still be ahead of the shit classes and then pray RNG gods to get a good 2 hander.
---
Yea and then send yourself all his gold.
---
I'm also not home until after the transfers are closed unfortunately.
---
Horde tears will be glorious when paid-transfers arrive! 😭
---
Sure, you don't have to, this is why most alliance rolled PVE realms in the first place.
---
obvious paladin
---
Razorgore EU is also well balanced in my experience - more Horde, but the Alliance are generally way more organised.
---
Those items are best in slot assuming you need the hit. If you have all of your hit you can opt for items that have more agi/crit.
---
How about paraphrasing it like this:
---
The modern game is 99% shit and I dont want to play it.
---
The old game is, well, 10% shit and 90% good. What if we fix the 10% of shitness?
---
Thats what this is about. Retail is a bland and meaningless game. Classic is a fun game. I'd just like if I could even play Classic right now.
---
To me the dealbreaker was simply possibility of playing a Shaman. It's such a more unique class in classic than in the live game and I have no interest in Paladin.
---
Congratz on your tin ore being sold!
---
Queue*
---
&gt; Is it possible? Yes. But it's a lot worse than druid/warr, so unless you have a group of 4 friends who are cool with it then it's going to get a lot of hate in groups. I would not recommend doing it in PUGs, you're going to have a huge learning curve of threat management when the tank has no taunt.
---
I wouldn'tt say "a lot worse", sure they can't tank right out of the gate a raid but give them a week or two after a raid's been released and they're more than capable. Shaman tanks are more than capable of doing 5 mans, there's a few shamans on my server who have cleared MC...
---
Greetings. I cannot find answer elsewhere, so is it possible to set abilities to cast on key down rather than key up? I got addons, tried cVar setting turned to 1 but nothing changed. Am I doing something wrong or is this function disabled at all? Thanks
---
It kills the server because it doesn't allow horde to have more than 10% advantage in numbers. Horde is now unable to win any battles. Horde gets demotivated and quits the game. They flock to reddit to complain about getting corpsecamped on their wayto BRM.
---
Alliance replies: Looks like PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
Just wait until the horde realized that they will get more honor in the open world doing what they are doing then waiting forever for a bg queue to pop because of faction imbalance.
---
I play(ed) on one of the only servers where it is flipped, Heartseeker. Alliance dominated. People are people it doesnt matter which faction lol.
---
Minimum 3 corpse runs per zone in to an instance, normally more lol. God forbid anyone needs BRD that bitch is probably a solid 10 corpse runs per zone in.
---
Anyways I've re rolled on a PVE server but I am also going to let my sub lapse in Feb. Blizz has no interest in servicing this product. 
---
They are fucking pathetic. 
---
Why did they not licence it out to a real company...
---
Just farm the Bloodfang hood. Like you have to show anything else.
---
Please post a screen or two of Ashenvale/Teldrassil if you’re ever there on business :)
---
I just wish Blizz had the faith like Jagex does with OSRS, where people would trust them to balance some simple things, without drastically changing the game.
---
I want classic to be as good as it can be, and even with its current flaws I still find really enjoyable, and by far the best version of WOW.
---
How so?  For a rogue, 100 ap, from str, is 100 ap no matter the level, and gives damage per hit based on weapon speed (normalized dmg for yellow atks) and health is static.
---
Only if I can get a finger guns emote, or a /shun emote that auto ignores the person you shun.
---
I could potentially upload my reshade preset but without the Nvidia filters it won't look the same. Not only that with the sharpening filters and what not I've added might look bad on someone running the game with a lower res then the 4k I'm at, like 1080p. Best thing to do would be to download Reshade yourself and tweak it yourself, you can do it all in real-time in-game.
---
We're likely to see PVP and PVE servers grouped together, like in Vanilla.
---
My take on it is that you pay these kind of things forward. I have no expectation of joining a guild and immediately being offered help with whatever quests or dungeons I need done, but if I've helped 2-3 other people do a quest or a dungeon, I'm pretty comfortable asking for help and that request being taken seriously.
---
I don't think there are any hard rules on it per se, but if a dude who's helped me on numerous occasions need help with the WW quest on his warr alt or is having trouble getting a Scholo group together, I'm a lot more inclined to help than if it's that dude who's always complaining, demanding help with shit, and telling others to just git gud when they're asking for help.
---
What the fuck is reck?
---
Like I told you in my very first post: no it wasn't obvious that it would be that bad and was rarely presented like this. This sub wasn't filled with stories of industrial ganking but with stories about how world PvP in Vanilla was the best. (I mean even people who were defending #nochange are just blaming that it's bad on 'mega server')  totally can understand that some people who didn't browse this sub intensively bought the hype.
---
And after all, did you write about it? I see that you write a dozen comments daily, so you must have made prediction so we can check?
---
Then let me ask you this question: how many players with an average 2 hours playtime do you need to match the presence of one hardcore players spending 8 hours ganking people? oh right 4x more... so to fight against 300 hardcore player pvping all day, you need 1200 average players to match their presence. (and I think you imagine how much harder it is to coordinate) 
---
And on top of that it's not like the average player of other faction will just watch and do nothing if they are attacked. I mean I might not like the state of PvP but when I was in Camp Mojache and alliance attacked, I didn't let myself kill. With the sheer amount of people and the hardcore PvPers that all ran to get hk, 10 min later they were being camped and in the long run, like I told you many times now: it's not like fighting back made their situation better in the long run. 
---
So what can I add: you can say "people were stupid to not understand was like this" "go back to retail or carebear PvE" but that doesn't change my point: the majority of players don't like the state of PvP at the moment and frankly can we blame them? I mean are you having fun ganking people 5vs1? spending day at flypath? killing people trying to get to BRD 4 times to get all your honor?
---
How is their ability to fight back stripped from them in a 1v1?, It's not like I'm a rogue, warrior, or mage, I'm a deep species resto shaman, these people just stop moving when they see you and give up without a fight.
---
Ah right okay, thanks. So its not because gnomes are small so daggers are basically swords to them ahah
---
yeah, if you are sitting you get critted, and since the reck bomb happens in just 1 batch, all 6 hits happen while his character was sitting.
---
Report him to twitch, they will act 1000x faster than Blizzard will.
---
Or just tell these nerds to get over it.
---
Sure why don’t we paraphrase it as shit you just made up on the spot instead of condensing what you actually wrote 😂
---
Enjoy your pvp server 😂
---
Came here to downvote all the n00bs who dont respect feral tanks.
---
seems like it yeah. But as I saw multiple times over the last days I still drop like a fly after the initial stunlock vs. warriors. But I don't even mind, warriors are the only class that can drop us in an instant like that. But yeah I can see how rogue talk triggers people instantly right in this thread. It was just a fun jab but people react like I've killed a few kids. :D
---
Lol I have 2 60's on Stalagg Ally. I've seen how the transfers wipe out a population. Stalagg is one of the worst faction balances in NA btw. I was simply making a comment on your alarmist idea that 60/40 is "unplayable". That's the exact logic that lead to the mass hysteria that destroyed servers. 60/40 is recoverable and not hopeless, but logic like yours creates an even bigger split.
---
Alright be a warrior with shabby gear if you want to. 
---
You realise the raids get harder right?
---
Ya well, panicking people. I had a 40 lock horde that i abandoned for a while, transferred it on ES in the last second, why not ?:)  
---
I met a single alliance player while leveling my rogue from 28 to 29 last night, and he was a twink. Wtf???
---
I think what you're describing is exactly the type of value any hybrid, especially a pally brings to groups that goes unnoticed. 
---
Folks get so focused on "the meters" that they often don't even see all of the little things you mentioned. Hell, I bet a good portion of your own group didn't even realize what that pally was bringing to the group besides buffs and mediocre dps. 
---
Good players make the game more enjoyable, no matter their class/spec.
---
Yea I didn't notice all the scrolling crap off to the side on my first watch
---
What a cry baby, it's a game. "alLiAnCe gM HeRe" like we give a fuck
---
Account sharing is not advocated but best solution is really to try to get someone to fix it. Do you know someone who you both trust? Ask them. 
---
Otherwise, ask a stranger on the internet or send a ticket to blizzard.
---
Recklessness, it's a 30 min cd that causes most of the warriors hits to crit.
---
I did a couple of Org at certain times of the day but I've got a whole screenshot folder of shots I probably even have one of those zones, I pretty much went to every zone setting this up to make sure it looked good everywhere.
---
NoChanges crowd: We want servers just like they were in vanilla!
---
YesChanges crowd: We want layering! And huge megasevers!
---
*5 months later*
---
"This is the fault of those NoChanges morons!!!!'
---
Find another post to comment on.
---
Ah, ok thanks!
---
I have $1 that says Noggenfogger EU is next to die to the same cancer.
---
Battle grounds are not cross realm
---
It was a pve server, so yes, things like that happened all the time if you were flagged for pvp. This was just the most ridiculous example of it because it was in IF so there were a bunch of people around, so more people responded. 
---
There is very little straight up 1v1 world pvp that ever happened on the pve servers that I played on because people didn't want to engage unless the odds were overwhelmingly in their favor. If you were flagged trying to take the different world pvp objectives in early expansions, if an opposite faction saw you, they very rarely would just attack you, they would call it out in chat and wait until more people came, then buff up and attack you in a group. Taking the different zones pvp objectives in BC, I was almost never attacked by one player, it was always either I was left completely alone, or it was 3+ people.  
---
You seem to have completely misconstrued the meaning of my post. It wasn't "I'm such a badass that it took 20 people with raid buffs to take me down." Exactly the opposite. It was "some people are so ridiculously afraid of world pvp that they waited until the numbers were overwhelming and still needed to buff up before attacking one person armed with a fishing pole going after a fishing achievement."
---
Some servers have free transfers due to major imbalances
---
Please don't do this carebear crap...
---
They're there, fishing up items to feed the opposing sides economy. I am not saying Kos every player, but goddamn should we not attack mounted players either if they are busy? 
---
There's zero accountability for rolling on a PvP server in this subreddit. This isn't about death squads or server imbalance, this is 'I chose a server where I can be attacked but I'd like to farm in peace so pls no'
---
I haven't killed any fisherman, but after reading this post I'm going to start.
---
All it takes is one person to abuse the emote and backstab you after you let him live. It would immediately loose value.
---
This was your moment and you provided. Nice.
---
its what planetside 2 does, in an attempt to keep faction balances more of less equal.
---
If I ever run a raid I'll have to remember to try this. Though not really looking to do that this time around. Might instead just pass this tip on to raid leaders if I feel we'll have an issue.
---
Back in WotLK I used to do a fair bit of B group and PUG raid leading for nax, 10/25 trials, and 10 man ICC. I was fully geared so it was just a way for me to get others some gear and raid experience. But damn if the drama doesn't come out over the smallest stuff and the whispers can be relentless. 
---
Then the non-core/PUG groups often feel like you are herding cats. Get one part correct then mess up another so you fix it then they get the original part wrong and the second part was done right.
---
Recklessness.
---
&gt; You think blizzard aint gonna start merging faction unbalanced pvp realms?
---
They haven't done this in 15 years, why would they do it now. Retail is way worse than Classic is with faction balance, yet they are still shoving it under the rug.
---
Bg's are crossrealm, and overall population across the realms is balanced. There won't be any queues.
---
How long do you think bwl attunement will take?  
---
There is only on mob that drops the quest start.
---
Most BiS list for resto druid have Shard of the Scale as the BiS trinket. I did some calculations and as i wrote in my OP the break even between Shard and Second Wind is 3 min. But yeah, amazing might be stretching it, but it is quite significantly better then Shard on most raid fights right now.
---
No you do it, I commented on the comment of the the post I made myself, it's MINE!
---
Earthshaker seems pretty good. (EU)
---
Damn that sucks. I’m on Skeram Alliance, and I really really hope transfers weren’t open on there. I haven’t played in like two weeks, but if more Alliance are given the option to transfer off that’s going to be VERY bad
---
Literally pay money to throw our lives away while we tell all of our friends and family but don’t speak of it in public??
---
You’re wasting your time. Either go in and dps normally or just do nothing
---
Balance changes being unpopular is mind boggling.
---
Classic is a separate game. It'll go through a different route than what Vanilla did. Why not make some number changes to make things a little more balanced?
---
Some specs only need number changes to be viable. That's all. Same gear, same talents, same rotations. Just a slightly higher ability modifier or a slightly lower mana cost.
---
I hope Classic+ brings some balance changes. There's no way for Classic to go aside from becoming its own thing, or releasing TBC and letting Classic just slowly fade into stagnation.
---
You are full of it. I joined in Beta, 2004. Was there in 2005. Things were never like this. Not during TBC, not during WOTLK. Blizzard is dumb and simply does not care. They watched without a single thing done as servers were going 1:4 in favor of one race. They did not care. They still don\`t.
---
Yeah, even says he was going too fast.  If you’re going over 10g in trades, take the extra time and double check.
---
I might be wrong, but to me this one reads like the hysteria from /r/wow swaps over here:
---
My highest char on Flamelash is lvl 49, so I have no clue about the situation at max level BUT:
---
In my experience so far, the ganking goes both ways. Sometimes you're the hammer, sometimes you're the nail. I did not notice any significant faction imbalance - and despite our factions being at war with e/o, I had various friendly interactions with the Alliance (heck - 2 Human warriors helped me get my Whirlwind Axe!) 
---
When the honor system hit, I fell victim to Alliance 5 vs 1s in Feralas - and this went on for quite some time before the Horde mounted significant defence.
---
&gt; So you think blizzard should take no blame for the server imbalance on their own servers? No blame for releasing so few servers at launch? No blame for non-specific transfers on already unevenly populated realms? No blame for the size of the servers?
---
Here is the question I ask of you, what is the solution?  Do they just release shitloads more servers?  Do those server get capped at something like 55-45 H/A?  What if the total H/A ratio across pvp servers is greater than 55/45?  Do you keep opening servers with what few alliance you can find to populate them?
---
What happens when you massive over expand your servers and then there is the slightest amount of attrition on that server?  How long until the people bitching about how unplayable it is on the massive servers are bitching about how unplayable the game is on the dead servers?
---
The amazing post hoc solutions only solve this ONE problem, but ignore the other problems it would create.  Player history and choices show they will congregate on the dominant faction and on the larger servers.  It is what players want to do.  You want to spread the population out massively and then watch as shitloads of servers reach dead mode.
---
Also you want to blame the server size as the problem?  Many private servers often had larger concurrent player counts than the largest classic servers with less of an issue.  Faction imbalance is certainly a problem, but the solution is to just keep splitting all the servers?
---
It's a fucking nonsense argument from people who simply want to blame Blizzard.  People want to be horde on pvp servers.  That is the reality.  People want to play on larger servers. That is the reality.  People don't like being inconvenienced .  That is the reality.  #nochanges was a horribly mentality which has harmed classic because it convinced people the game would be like vanilla and that anything which makes the game not seem the same is the fault of Blizzard.  It's not Blizzard's fault, it's largely on the players.  The solution Blizzard created for this problem in retail is sharding/layering.  In reality, it's the best solution for this problem as well.  People get pissy about it because #nochanges.
---
&gt; So its not the migration its the aggro management? shame, PvP here i come i suppose
---
Sourdeeza is seriously misinformed on the matter. I suggest searching google and finding someone more informed on the matter.
---
Ahhh so u wanted to play on a pve server, i see
---
&gt; How long do you think bwl attunement will take?
---
LIke 40 minutes maybe?
---
I love how alliance players think horde, even on horde sided servers, are immune to death and never die ever.
---
Play horde even on a 60/40. Level a warrior. I dare ya. The alliance will be so far up your ass by the time they get pulled out they'll be crowned King Arthur.
---
Nice! Feel free to upload more and post a link :)
---
Yes they did, I played on Trollbane-PVP which was part of the Reckoning battlegroup (my [armory achievements](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/stormscale/dcruide/achievements/legacy/player-vs-player) show my vanilla experience). Here's the vanilla wowwiki page for our server which shows the PVE/PVP/RP servers we were grouped with -  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Trollbane\_Europe](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Server:Trollbane_Europe).
---
I was a horde warrior on a majority alliance server in vanilla. I was definitely ganked a fair bit and camped once in a great while, but it was not remotely close to what we're seeing now.
---
Bummer, looks like no attempt made to make the book actually interesting or Warcraft related based on the pages you have in the photo. So it’s just a regular boring cookbook with weird food names.
---
Welcome to the alliance experience everywhere else, and in feralas most of the time too.
---
Yeah that's what happens to flamelash now aswell. The first people leaving make over people leave, and then everyone is forced to leave. If you're not transferred before 01:00 this night Alliance, u might aswell delete your account
---
How so? Everyone else is moving off, so your choices are either stay and be the 20% vs 80% or leave and be the 80%. In one of those you can barely play the game except in instances (getting to which requires 40 mins of corpse running). In the other you essentially play on a PvE server with very rare PvP interactions. I know which one I'd choose.
---
You can look up videos people have posted of how gameplay looks on a 20/80 split server. Or try making an alt on the losing side of one of those. People complaining about the outnumbered faction leaving should really consider that it's humans playing those characters, who probably don't enjoy being constantly farmed like mobs at every FP and dungeon entrance in the game.
---
Where did you get that info that Ally dominates Earthshaker?
---
Afaik , Earthshaker is 45:55 in horde favor.
---
Would be funny if this was another COD scam
---
I don't care. Not jealous in anyway. You sell gold you get banned. Simple
---
Also, free server transfers have been a thing now. So people who scam can transfer and name change so they basically have nothing to worry about on reputation side of things.
---
I fucking wish our MT was like you. Just the other day on Discord he just straight up said that once he gets his second binding, he's never attending MC again unless it's on his alt. I can't put into words how despicable an attitude like that is in the member you expect to be the most committed to his role. Never playing his main anymore, can't even get the dude to come to Scholo to craft flasks for me (even after having cleared the instance with a pug) despite the fact that he demanded the flask recipes from gbank due to being the "guild alchemist" because he's "busy playing alt". So much hate for this guy.
---
I can assign any button on my mouse to whatever I want.  So I can have the easiest button to press be just "8" or I can make that button be Alt Shift CTRL 8 or whatever I want
---
If it’s a revolving door, sigh, that’s not good. Like others said, set a minimum, our guild set minimum to 30, every boss is 5 point, so a new raider cant get gear in his first run. I still feel like this is not going to solve the problem tho. Think about this way, lets use druid as example. I’m a new druid healer in your guild, i’m trying hard to come to every raid, i get some points, finally my t2 helm drops, i rolled on it, and then you a tank druid rolled on it too, and of course you win because you have much more points, now i’m gonna be pissed and leave the guild because you are a tank, you dont use that helm, next time in a raid, you are still gonna be in ur tank gear, and i’m still using my crappy blue helm. That’s why it’s a revolving door.
---
I never said we were weak and I know how powerful rogues are. But yeah, I hate dwarf warriors so much right now. I didn't even know they can use stoneform to come out of blind... Wanted to blind one and then first aid and restealth but that bugger just used stoneform and put me on my ass. :)
---
Plenty of private servers had concurrent populations on par with or higher than the current mega servers.  Server size isn't the inherent problem.  Even with lower pops the open world ganking would be high.  People would also bitch if they weren't able to be on mega servers.  You can try to say otherwise, but the history of wow shows people want massive servers.
---
I see countless horde rogues and druids in IF all day. I do /who of org, uc, tb. 0 players at all times. I can go to kargath and see more people just sitting there than in IF. Its really a one sided problem.
---
You say that like there aren't roaming alliance gank squads as well. They're just less numerous.
---
Don't even fish near other fisherman.  I normally mute all but sfx and watch TV while listening for splash.  Other fisherman coming up ruins that.
---
One of the reasons I was looking forward to Classic was a return to World PvP. Maybe I was naive to think it would be like the early days. Oh well maybe I'll try out that Warhammer Online PS I heard about
---
you really think there was no faction imbalance in vanilla/tbc/wotlk? okay :)
---
what do you suggest they do?
---
better than his healing UI rofl
---
Well shit, I’m at work now. I already unsubbed with the hope of returning for BGs to level my 52 Druid, but I guess I’m fucked lmao guess I won’t re sub
---
Are you sure you didn't discover it... *off* accident?
---
Except increasing the number of players per server is a huge change. With any sort of imbalance you have thousands of extra  players on one faction that can blanket every leveling zone grinding honor.
---
Toxic mentality. Those are other people, too
---
2 mages is fine, just need good coordination and to not over pull
---
Exactly. It forces the A/H ratios to be equal. If you don’t like it transfer to a different server or join the opposite faction
---
I don't trust the wow community or blizzard  nearly enough for that. Just look at the forums and see what kind of changes people suggest there.
---
Some of the flaws are what makes vanilla so loved. I fear that if they started to touch class balance classic could lose it's identity really fast.
---
I understand the CoD “trick”, but you can’t be scammed in WoW by using some brain power outside of someone crafting items for you.  A CoD scam?  You mean when you look at an item and choose to pay an amount?  Same with AH items being priced in various ways, no one is forcing you to buy those and can be avoided by just taking an extra couple seconds.
---
You two also exchanged saliva. That's the start of a beautiful relationship.
---
Not sure you know what semantics means. A person can host a bot, I just used the word being instead. Sure plenty got the meaning.
---
Even balanced servers can have unbalanced pvp. If you start restricting the access of the winning faction because the losing faction starts quitting, you're just encouraging them to quit too.
---
Also there's the absurdity of thinking a company would restrict access to their product from paying customers just because other people are no longer having fun. 
---
There's tons of other solutions that don't arbitrarily lock out people from the game they are paying monthly to play.
---
I'm crying about being less popular? What? As being a streamer I can see how insane it is to get so many people in such short time.. It's a crafty con. And I'm exposing it..
---
There was only 1 server choice for most of those private servers, and the private servers implemented faction queues, what's your solution?
---
&gt; Balance changes being unpopular is mind boggling.
---
probably because retail WoW has gotten so bad people would rather play a 15 year old game than play that. why would people believe that they won't just fuck it up again?
---
I don’t know how anyone justifies five minute weapon buffs for shaman or 15 minute raid blessings for paladins. It adds nothing but headaches. 
---
The honor system from vanilla is objectively terrible. It rewards time played in a way that encourages account sharing or unhealthy playing habits to reach top rank.
---
I saw a bot warrior twice yesterday. Don’t understand
---
their lack of self awareness is soo infruriating it makes me wanna scream.
---
Surely if he doesnt have the time to level a new character, playing two characters is out of the question.
---
8pc is BiS bc of set bonus, so T1 isn't interchangable.  There also isn't another neck with more crit/AP than ony head.  The hit it provides is just bonus.
---
There is a 1% crit green ring, or quick strike that hunter's won't get for awhile.  But giving up Tarnished Elven with 15 agi (30AP, 0.3% crit) for that isn't much of an upgrade. So I don't believe there are as many options as you would think.
---
Are you lost? He's making a joke, not a damn serious response.
---
Let's calculate that with premades. You can easily reach a 75% winrate with premades and can get a game down to 20-30 minutes. That's 450 games played, at 30 minutes a game (((271/0.75)*30)/60/24) which is about 7 days of playtime. Worst case. Best case would be around 5 days (~20min a game). 
---
That's absolutely doable. My main already has 20 days played on level 60. And I'm only playing weekends and evenings since I have a pretty busy job.
---
It's possible that's true... However the inverse is that alliance will have extremely fast queues, so won't bother to world PVP. So who would horde kill?
---
Nah just woke.
---
They never spawn cleansed. But they stay uncleansed for a long period of time, enough that you can harvest the uncleansed version for hours.
---
But they'd have no way of knowing anything about them. So it's a completely empty threat
---
It’s griefing because the pussies that 4v1 the walk to BRM all day don’t want to have any negative consequences for their actions, so now they’ll all cry P L E A S E C H A N G E S like the babies they are. I hope they get the shit spammed on them so they meltdown.
---
&gt; People that spend their time in bgs will most likely come from PvP servers.
---
lol no
---
Keyboard-turning, clicker PvP video maker with 8 pocket healers, at that. 😬
---
It wasn't really that there was nothing to do for casual players.  The complaints were that there was no real commensurate path for progression.
---
Two players could both put in 20 days /played.  The raider would be deck out in full epics.  But the casual players would be in mostly blues and maybe an odd epic or two.  Equal time commitment, but the casual players lags significantly behind because WoW rewards concentrated time commitments.
---
It's a valid complaint.  I'm not saying it needs to be addressed or change, but it is valid.
---
Earthshaker is the 3 second AoE stun, later version TUF gives a chance for a one second single target stun.
---
Canvas bag
---
Yeah I agree, there seems to be no good solution right now because I doubt they will mix PVP and PVE. 
---
But in general I think people on pvp servers are way more dedicated to pvp and some of them even set all their goals in pvp, while on pve servers i dont really see that problem. 
---
So i think both factions will have bad experiences with queues, but for a majority of pve or rp players this wont matter too much. On pvp servers tho... people will get really angry when they realize that they cant even compete in a single BG in their limited time after work. 
---
Really looking forward to those kind of threads... not
---
That undead lock wasn’t soul link tho
---
Hey hey, it ain't global. It's just mostly the zones that's relevant for level 60s to grind, quest, instance, gather..
---
*laughs in windfury totem*
---
I meant to pick a pvp server but goofed and picked normal. Really glad I did now tho...
---
I wouldn't blame bliz 100%. Streamers are a part of that too, because streamer servers are absolutely overpopulated and imbalanced
---
Retail has a completely different design philosophy than Classic. Just because some people in Classic would like a few quality of life updates doesn’t mean they want to play a Diablo MMO with quad-RNG loot drops.
---
Blizzard originally planned for a total of 8 PVP servers worldwide. There are now over 50 of them.  If you think Blizz doesnt deserve even the slightest bit of blame for this the I dont know what to tell you.
---
It's super funny that on my server the Alliance was bragging how they could just walk into horde city's and kill the leaders easily and how they owned BRM, once honor came out they all just hide in IF now.
---
or worth it
---
Im not panicking, i actually like the new influx of players.
---
Yeeeee come and fight me, alli boring here
---
Have you seen those living moss bathmats?  
---
Like that, but a robe.
---
I just "laugh in PvE" .. 
---
We have a constant "open battleground going at Southshore / Tarren Mill" that is consensual and fairer than 99% of pvp encounters in pvp realms :P
---
OP delivered his delivery.
---
is it though .. ?
---
One of my addons allows this functionality, I believe its leatrix?
---
I’m on a PVP server because that’s where my friends wanted to go. I play a rogue with 0 desire to PVP and I never gank players even if they are worth honor. I’m here to dumpster the meters in raids, collect phat loots, and go about my way.
---
There’s no such thing as even fights in wpvp. If we bring 10 to fight 10. Horde will come back with 20. We bring 20, horde being a whole raid
---
Basically it's Alliance are all bad at pvp and he hates the game.
---
Agree with the post but calling other people who voice different opinions "strawman mental midget" destroys your argument a lot. People are allowed to have different ideas compared to you. Don't attack them for it.
---
Regardless, I also play on Gehennas as alliance and it is a nightmare at present. However, I would argue that Gehennas is in a completely different league to all other servers especially in terms how hardcore it is.
---
Gehennas is the main flagship server for all the pserver players. These people have been playing classic for years and are extremely dedicated indeed.  Most of the major guilds are organised, constantly online and steamroll content. It's important to keep this in mind. The game feels so much more relaxed on a server like Zandalar tribe compared to Gehennas right now.
---
Disclaimer: Alliance on Gehennas,  Alliance on Zandalar Tribe. Horde on Shazzrah.
---
For truth. I started WoW during the Beta and rolled PvP server "BeCaUsE tHaTs ThE rEaL eXpErIeNcE". This time around I mashed the PvE button so hard....
---
&gt;You do understand that 1 overpower crit will chunk your hp by at least 40-50% in comparable gear?
---
You do understand one auto and a mortal strike will do more damage than that, right? Popping evasion is still the smart play against warriors as you'll usually dodge an attack anyways so the overpower will be coming no matter what, and you'll be dodging all of the other attacks in the meantime. 
---
Getting hit by overpower every five seconds is much better than getting hit constantly for five seconds along with the chance of being hit by overpower. Pretty simple logic there
---
I only said that was what I had personally heard with the qualifier of "so far". I was very open to being wrong, I just wanted to know it wasn't just people's assumptions.
---
How much did you CC throughout the dungeon? Was the shaman tanking 1-2 mobs at a time and you guys just entirely focusing on single target DPS?
---
He literally says Classic has an outdated system 🤣
---
I don’t think anyone would argue against that statement, including OP; sort of a “it goes without saying” statement. Sounds like OP thinks “check google” applies to maybe 90% of queries, and you fall around 60%? I think you guys are saying the same thing.
---
He respawns quickly.  We used to stand there for a few minutes and get multiple people attuned.
---
The other thing to keep in mind is that with reshades / filters, while it might look gorgeous at this area in this time of day, it may look awful in other areas / weathers / times of day. That's how it is in Fallout 4 at least. Getting it right so that it looks good throughout the game during day / night / different weathers is tough.
---
Come to Pagle, roll Horde!
---
Basically the trick is as long as you don’t have the curse the damage in minimal that shaz does to your melee. Make sure that they see the curse cool down on their deadly boss mods, and when it’s about to come up they move back, have them get decursed and then they can go back in. 
---
Basically if you keep them curse free it will speed your fight up by about 5 min
---
Maybe you might be on an outlier server. And your main actions colour your perception too; if you're mostly pvping either way you'll mostly see fights you partake in. If you're a skilled player you'll often play with similar players and see yourself winning most of the time.
---
Nice try guy wanting to make it easier for himself and wean others out of PvP!
---
There’s a reason they’re referred to as locusts. Fly in, consume everything, whine, leave.

1. Give someone money because youre careless

2. Blame classic for it

---
Faction queues can work on private servers largely because people aren't paying.
---
Best solution is sharding/layering.
---
Lol. You are literally giving an example of why faction queues are a bad idea.
---
Taking your (butthurt) fantasy as a real situation, what happens to the alliance on the server after they chase all the horde away? Now they are on an unbalanced serve, and people are no longer able to log in because there are queues, because the horde quit. Congrats, you just restricted access to your own server.
---
Gratz on lvl 60 mate. Even know we are on different factions, you have proven a worthy player and shall receive the Recognition that is well deserved :D
---
Submit it?

---
While it may take some digging, the Classic Druid discord has a some great resources for every spec and play style, including Balance. 
---
From my understanding of the current meta, a well-geared Moonkin can keep up with other classes but must be on top of mana management for any fight over 90 seconds.  Mana pots, runes, and even your Innervate will be required to keep up.  The aura is a moderate DPS boost as well but, like LotP, isn’t a game-changer.  I don’t think Bees is worth the debuff slot and even Moonfire may not be worth it for the raid as a whole. 
---
All of this is dependent on your raid seriousness and if you put forth the required effort you can outperform most people.
---
&gt; Flurry is bis till bwl though mate.
---
Can you not make it sound like you elaborated that for years, wrote a bachelors thesis about Flurry Axe and everything, when all you did is read one internet guide.
---
Mmmyess!
---
I've uploaded a couple of Orgrimmar at early morning and at sunset but for sure, if I find a spot that looks good I'll take a shot and upload it.p
---
Thank you, you are a worthy enemy.
---
I’m not sure how much organization would matter if one side has a significant numbers advantage over the other. Given how high the server populations are in Classic, even a 60/40 balance is a huge advantage for one faction. I’ve never been on a PVP realm, but intuitively, you can see there is no in-game incentive for the larger side to not just farm the shit out of the smaller side for honor. 
---
No one wants to be locked into corpse runs 24/7. I’m pretty sure that now Earthshaker is either going to suffer the same crap the Alliance put up with on Flamelash, or the Horde transfers too, and the cycle repeats infinitely either way. Honestly, given the very limited support Blizzard seems to be putting into Classic, Phase 2 could be their master stroke for thinning the userbase of Classic.
---
Totems have their own aggro table, FYI.
---
Yeah same. 
---
I even used to get up the stable's roof in AB, which is quite gamebreaking, but never received a warning or anything.
---
I’m daggers
---
Just reroll.. seriously. It's really not hard and on a pve server it's a joke.
---
Congratulations! You can read internet guides really well!
---
Nah, went and got my lionsheart. Currently have 23.5% crit and 6% hit with the rest of my gear. Worth it to me, i really don’t see the need for a faster mount as I don’t leave my gold grind dungeons much
---
That’s the spirit!
---
Some people like to play games by discovering as they play, or maybe they're not invested enough to look up guides for everything, and that's okay, that's how they want to play and if they like it it's fine.
---
From the players you kill. You play warlock it should be easy enough
---
Just /moan at them. A lot.
---
Server transfers and population caps. Go throw your temper tantrums somewhere else.
---
Its fine.
---
Went with the shoulders, chest, legs for now. Will swap out the shoulders when I get my Truestrike and equip the boots.
---
This only affects try hard reddit users who have 2 lvl 60’s
---
If all you wanna do is fish don’t play on a pvp server
---
Counterstrike didn't let you join a team that had too many people.
---
It's happening 100% because *blizzard* decided to make megaservers with layering instead of sticking to #nochanges and making vanilla servers as they should be. if they had done the right thing, there would be no issues.
---
Absolutely lmao @ your post
---
Unfortunately I got it off Anvilcrack in UBRS and it doesn't quite cover the cost of a failed rend attempt..don't ask I have no idea i've never seen that happen
---
&gt;Rogues ganking fishers

kek
---
Yo, can you link the WA you have that shows you when you get a Sword Spec proc?  Does it work for HoJ?  I want to be able to see my free attacks.
---
I still don't understand why Blizzard went with this mount "system". It's not the way it used to be in 1.12. 
---
Riding should be the expensive skill to buy, not the mount.
---
We would only shackle one mob a pull to help the incoming damage and would save a shackle in case of an accidental pull. Helps that we were a guild group all in voice chat too
---
Yeah, that's why I'm not sure. Not enough information to tell from this clip.
---
The fact that you took my post seriously is a nice display of horde IQ. Why would I be butthurt anyway, Firemaw isn't that bad and I'm still having fun every night.
---
Yah, we could def use a bit more Allies to come over here. 
---
But it's not too bad compared to most servers.
---
As an outside observer, I just want to point out that you didn't engage with their argument and went for personal attacks by completely ignoring what they said and trying to make it seem like it was just whiny PvP on a PvP server complaints.
---
They don't have any problem with PvP on a PvP server. In fact, they even seem to enjoy it. However, they think the game is currently unplayable due to the oppressive faction imbalance. It's their opinion is that the imbalance is mostly a problem due to the \#nochanges crowd. Engage with that argument, not the strawman you created.
---
Not to mention theirs actually looks cool too. At least in comparison.
---
I'm overacting when I say they should never lose but you see my point. 
---
Warlock are easy, just kill their pet while sapped. The only hard match up for them may be mages because they share the same kind of busted CD.
---
I don't see any other classe capable to engage a fight at will, stunlock any target, and able to reset a fight pretty much anytime they want. 
---
Two vanishes, two blinds, 30sec sap, gouge. 
---
I main a hunter and tend to beat a rogue engaging me. But that's just because most of them are awful. I wouldn't stand a chance vs a good rogue.
---
 I thought I'd enlighten you guys on how to replicate it. I'm not sure if the person used this trick but i assume he did. Here is the Origin of it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRESAQJGGYY&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRESAQJGGYY&amp;t=1s) and here is more or less an explanation of it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKLZ8KAkqwE&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKLZ8KAkqwE&amp;t=1s). It has all to do with the Unable to Move Function in Customer Support if you use it during a Flightpath weird things happen.
---
You probably does not distinguish using the addon from uploading data to a site.
---
1. Using the addon does nothing for a site that aggregates the data.
---
2. One single scan is enough to get all the data for the faction at the moment of scan.
---
3. The site depends on players uploading scan data so it can aggregate scans form different times (i.e. its irrelevant how many players upload). What matters for the site is how often data is uploaded even if from 1 player per faction.
---
And in classic it's a goddamn IMMUNITY.
---
Feral druid got the jump on you and decided he wants to make you bleed? Choose to be unbleedable for 8 seconds.
---
Rogues cry because bye-bye blind (and even crippling poison can't apply).
---
You can even slightly confuse an undead priest when their devouring plague refuses to... well... devour. (Or even plague for that matter, because guess what? Stoneform is 8 seconds of your white blood cells becoming FIGHT BLOOD CELLS and keeping all disease at bay.)

It's like I'm really in another delusional Skyrim modding thread.
---
 &gt; I once spent at least 20 min just to deliver a quest in SG.
---
Searing Gorge is basically a dead zone for questing right now.  It's too small and too open.  Burning Steppes at least has a lot of space and it's not as popular to camp.
---
I've just hit 60 and I think I was 52 when honor was released.  You just have to know where to go to quest.  Tanaris, Un'Goro, Blasted Lands, Winterspring these are not good options.  Plaguelands, Felwood, Hinterlands, these are good zones.
---
Dungeons, at least BRD or LBRS have a lower xp/hr than questing.  UBRS has practically none.  The Tiron Fordring quest is great xp and lets you stay off roads and away from players, not to mention really nice rewards.
---
the clicking is hard to watch... even clicking water and food :(
---
If your guild has decent dps and wants to try hard you can pop greater arcane protection potions and just kill him before everybody starts taking too much damage. [Here's my guilds last kill](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/wCh3129nbkPQcqXd#fight=24)
---
We use two pots. We pop one while killing trash after geddon so that it's off cooldown again to use again mid fight.
---
If your raids dps is lower then you can use a similar tactic but wait until say 75% or 50% before your melee commit to zerging him down. Seems like between two potions you have around 20-25 seconds before your healers get overwhelmed.
---
Not directly gold selling
---
Blizzards tos? So is s scamming
---
Oh huh
---
very fun with death-reckonning. Walk around in a heavily ganked area. Get murdered by roaming squad. Walk back and Rezz+one shot one of the poor fuckers who is eating/drinking.
---
It was the TBC patch that made riding skill expensive. Vanilla was exactly like this.
---
You think people in vanilla were cavemen that didnt know how to min/max? Everything will clear up when BG's are released.

Mooides Mount Mod! In twitch/curse.
---
It automatically dismount you when opening the flight path map and every time you would get the error "you are mounted"
---
Can highly recommend!
---
Need a source for this, would be lame
---
I have the bomber jacket and have never worn a more comfortable jacket, super warm, has also stood up perfectly for almost two years of regular use... And with one of the horde sweaters, I love most blizzard clothes they are great quality (that's not what this robe is though, is a gimmick)
---
It's not a 15 year old game, per se. Classic is running off of the modern client.
---
If they are putting in the same amount of time, why is one labeled as hardcore and one casual? This seems to be directed at raiding vs not. If someone is putting the same amount of time in as a raider and not raiding, that’s their issue to resolve. There was most definitely nothing to do for casual players compared to someone that could raid.
---
&gt;... when in reality...
---
&gt;... you should thank the #NoChanges morons for this entire mess.
---
yikes
---
&gt;The modern player has changed. People don't play games the same way they did it in 2003. The methods are refined, content has been explored, it's all about efficiency now.
---
This isn't true, it's a meme.  What we have is more people on each server and an old discovered game with info readily available.  The people are the same.
---
&gt;At least I find solace and satisfaction by going to those old threads, finding these #NoChanges zealots, checking their post history
---
You shouldn't because your thesis is wrong.  But then again a lot of people find happiness in ignorance.
---
Wow the thread necro, this is a 2+ month old comment on a 0 karma post.
---
It's definitely a lot worse, even the author of that article would agree with me.
---
&gt;Shamans are classified under Viable and with each theorycrafter joining our ranks
---
and contributing their work, perhaps shamans could “feasibly” one day dethrone those braggadocious paladin tanks/bear tanks and reach a
---
theoretical semi-optimal spot
---
&gt; To restate my point, you
---
decide to go shaman tank if you want a challenge in an otherwise easy to clear raid
---
And to throw some shade on the validity of that document, ctrl+f and he *literally doesn't even bring up crushing blows once*. I don't know why I'd even bother doing more than a cursory read on a document that isn't even going to bring up the discussion of crushing blows... for survivability, you're looking at the biggest issue of druid tanking (can't get uncrushable) without the patch of "having outrageous health" that druids have.
---
Shamans generate threat, sure; but that's like saying a warlock can tank because they can hold threat. Sure, you can, but it's objectively much worse. And that's before you get to the "they don't have a taunt" which means any boss with tank swap mechanics needs to have the tanks paying huge attention to their threat meters to make swapping even possible. It's just much more convoluted with no benefits whatsoever.
---
I could but it most likely wouldn't look the same, depending on your resolution and monitor etc, I gave the preset to my mate to try but the sharpening filters and stuff looked like shit at 1080p compared to 4k
---
Reckoning persists through death? o_o
---
Not releasing BGs at the same time is absolutely something Blizzard fucked up, I do agree with that.  Here's the problem, people bitched incessantly about #nochanges, and BGs didn't come out until after the Honor system.  There were shitloads of extremely vocal people using the #nochanges shit to have a BG-less honor system for awhile for their precious world pvp.  As I mentioned, I agree Blizzard should have told these people to shut the fuck up and release BGs at the same time, but they caved to very vocal players.
---
I don't absolve Blizzard of any guilt in how things have gone.  I think they should never have catered to the #nochanges people and tried to make the game as similar as possible.  I don't think they did zero research into private servers.  I do think they horribly underestimated how many people would play which led to them listening to the extremely vocal #nochanges people.  It has created a mentality where vanilla is a mythologized glorious unicorn and if classic isn't as great as it was dreamed the problem lies in ANY change which was made instead of any other possible explanation.
---
I used to farm WPL right on the zone border by UC. Bears and spiders.
---
&gt; the horde did this to themselves
---
bro players don't sit down at a table and say "okay let's break our server"  
---
there's no collective meta strategy, this is just the byproduct of 2019 gamers playing with an incredibly flawed 2004 reward structure
---
Most people have no interest in RP on the server or just occasionally see it as something extra that just happens to be on the server. It is a great addition to make the world feel alive even for people that do not RP at all.
---
Only thing is that people should respect those who do but there hasn't been much issue with that.
---
If you look at logs, Ferals are actually on par with mages for most single target fights, atleast in current content. I'm sure they scale harder later on.
---
It's not about time, it's about marginal benefit. If 10 minutes on a low lvl alt is more enjoyable than 10 minutes dying on his main, and if that happens frequently, then maybe he'll switch all together. Sunk cost.
---
Not to mention weak ass servers that cannot hold big pvp battles.
---
Blizzard refuses to fix issues in the game and game has already lost majority of players. They are seeing the decline and are taking all resources away from the game which leads to even lower chance that they actaully fix the issues. There isn't any reason to keep subscribing when game is in current state..
---
Unfortunately, I've never encountered a shadow priest solo.  They always seem to be with a buddy who always makes it his life goal to see me taking a dirt nap.  Hard to dispel when you are fighting to stay vertical.
---
But I'll keep that in mind for the next time I see one solo.
---
Don’t see it very often but I’m glad to see another person from AR who enjoys it as much as I do. I’ll make sure to say something if I see you online
---
can confirm, level 54 rogue on sulfuras, haven't gained a level in a week cause alliance camps every single zone with 10+ man death squads.
---
"just decurse."
---
"Cleanse plz if someone gets diseased."
---
"Focus adds"
---
"Ignore adds, burn the boss"
---
Watching a YouTube walkthrough for 5man content is massive overkill.
---
Kari*
---
Sharding entirely breaks the immersion of the game, especially in world Pvp, makes the game significantly less fun. If you can't see that, then idk what to tell you besides go back to retail.
---
You don’t need to be attuned to enter. Just go through Ubrs. Wait a week, let it calm down, do you quest.
---
Are you trying to tell me all these servers reddit claims are dead are the actual vanilla experience you were looking for? 
---
Crazy. Glad yo hear you landed on a good server!
---
... that you can put a counterweight on.
---
Lol way to try to promote yourself 😂
---
Yeah true, fair enough. Looks nice though man
---
I haven't found anything of value, either. I've been relying on Wowhead's BiS list, but it lacks some depth of options. I wish there was more research available for optimal mana management, statistical impact of crit/hit/int/spi on dps. Once I hit 60, I will start crunching some of the numbers myself if I haven't found anything better online by then.
---
Even if that is true it would never happen. Just like a PvE server would never be merged with a PvP server.
---
Every other melee ignored every convention to go full ArP as well.
---
I guess I'll have to do it myself:)
---
Do you know if there's a good place to try things like this out? maybe a dead corner in some zone perhaps?
---
Not Blizzards fault if players don't transfer servers and population caps grow with server population. I understand you're too stupid to know what you're talking about but crying like the little bitch you are isn't a viable defense for faction queues.
---
Ironic you're trying to say I'm the one who can't 3v1 when you're only solution is to stop the better players from playing the game. It must suck having a video game being the only worthwhile thing in your life that you throw this big of a temper tantrum when other people beat you.
---
Knights of the Peanut have left as well
---
Blur? Open up the full image, that bitch is crisp af haha
---
So two wrongs make a right? Can you stop trying to justify harassment?
---
I imagine you pressing your keyboard like a piano, making chords before releasing keys etc
---
Yeah man. Top down leadership is so important. There are people in my guild and LC that I wanna tell to fucking kick rocks, but others who have helped me and given me free xmutes and worked on being inclusive, which makes me want to stay instead of joining another guild.
---
Haha. Mmm have alot more keys binded now.. Will of forsaken got binded after that.. Zz
---
What does not tally up with people saying they are banned in waves is it completely ignores the fact that a lot of them should be getting banned off the back of player reports, not any form of software detecting bot-like behaviour.
---
This is an excuse that is a lot more feasible in games like shooters where there generally aren't paid support staff that can investigate suspicious player behaviour.
---
Saying that if bots were banned immediately it would make the botters aware of how they were detected is also fairly dubious. Like with the vast majority of cheating in games the bot scripts will have been distributed to 1000s of people operating independently.
---
It's highly likely the majority of people using bot software never wrote it themselves and also are unlikely to know how it works on a programming level. They will just pick the next bit of software  circulating on hacking sites, there will be no feedback on "I did this action and this happened to my account" it will be "bot tool doesn't work, need a new one"
---
Maybe I'm wrong, it just seems incredibly convenient that taking a long time to ban has the side effect of ensuring Blizzard are getting subscriptions from these accounts for as long as possible.
---
Also if people DID learn that a specific bot was now detected and triggering bans, would that not be a good idea as it would stop people using that tool? Either people bot for as long as possible "undetected" or they get banned and the class acts making these tools need to figure out how to write a new one that doesn't get detected.
---
And the modern client is running off the vanilla client just been modified over the years. But you get what I mean though.
---
Did i say alliance dont do that? I simply pointed to a reason why world pvp is unbalanced atm.
---
Sorry you all can't remove your emotions from an objective statment. 
---
If you rolled alliance thinking it was gonna be the dominant world pvp faction, you had no idea how world pvp was gonna work. 
---
Regardless of who does what, wow is slanted toward horde for pvp and slanted toward alliance for pve. Thats my only point. Which is correct.
---
Burn all the #NoChanges Believers!
---
yours is what the dog creates, delete the post if you don’t like comments on it. And if you don’t like getting called out for your BS. We all know you are re-rolling cause you probably could not deal with pvp
---
anymore
---
PvE servers FTW.
---
Enjoying Classic to the max. Raiding as Horde and leveling alts on both factions.
---
wPvP happens when you want it to happen at TM. If you want the thrill, you can always keep PvP open while questing.
---
Playing on a PvE server is genuinely reminiscent of my Vanilla PvP server experience.
---
I've played a Gnome in a DnD campaign. The allure is a sort of David and Goliath angle where, if you care even the slightest about roleplay, you use your mind over might. 
---
Arguments could be made for gnome warriors being more tacticians (or feral lawnmowers). A Gnome rogue is well aware of the advantage that their stature brings them. A Gnome mage is just double dipping into big-brain book-learning, whereas with Warlocks, is it really impossible to see why they'd bargain for power far greater than mortal muscle? IF I cared enough to be completely thorough, I guess I could go into gnome lore, but let's not forget the obvious reason to play a gnome.
---
You like being comic relief and/or you think they're cute.
---
Or you're Verne Troyer (RIP)
---
Then I would def suggest you talk to your LC lead and see about T2 helm and ony neck from head as from the sounds of it the rest of you group needs the “help”.
---
Comeon over to westfall i'll level an alt with you.
---
I don't think you understand what he's saying
---
Gotta love all this classic wow content on the sub today
---
You could always do what I did and download Reshade and tweak it yourself. You can do it real-time in-game it's really easy, when you install it just let it download the additional effects so you have more to play with.
---
You mean vanilla? If yes, this wasnt nearly true,at least on my Server,a big german pvp server,they were around 40-50g in the endphase of vanilla
---
You don’t get 100 str from a crusader proc at lvl 19.
---
2v1 and you're as good as done. My method since I main holy is to wave, dance, or sit down.
---
Seems to me that people don't seem to like world pvp as much as they thought they would.  I am sorry you can't handle pvp, perhaps you should go back to retail and turn off war mode.
---
^This  
---
It's hilarious seeing people quote private server players in ways that makes it clear they've never touched any of the private servers that are/were available.
---
AV wolf/ram has a base price of 800g, so 640g with honor discount or 720g without.
---
You realize that is a long, long time after servers with a healthy faction balance opens the gates?
---
60% mount; he didn’t make it
---
thats the worst source for Population data ive ever seen LOL
---
Don't know yet. Fluctuated from 650 gold to 10 gold in vanilla.
---
There is it it’s all about posting your twitch name for views. Sounds like your jealous bro.
---
??? I was literally the first comment on this post. Go away.
---
It would fall under greifing or unintended gameplay. Just because you can doesn't mean you should in the spirit of the game. In some cases blizz will crack down on this but it would usually need to be frequently happening and be giving some players a sizeable unfair advantage.
---
&gt; Pet food dissappear when the pet hits/enter combat
---
It was that way even in vanilla.
---
Why would people quit a balanced server? This is a new height of mental gymnastics
---
Created a new toon on a PVE server after getting ganked non stop on my old server. My question is, does it benefit me to choose the faction with the smaller population on the server? I figured less competition for groups, better chances of getting into BGs. Thoughts?
---
I'm trying to say I don't think it constitutes harassment.
---
so true
---
I didnt say every horde player is a min/max. 
---
However the players who wanted to max pvp grind and understood wow classic, went horde.
---
Its a very simple example of metagaming in wow classic causing world pvp imbalance.
---
Just because allaince have gank squads and commit to world pvp doesnt change the fact that horde racials suit pvp and alliance racials suit pve.
---
Nonsense. Glancing blows are never rmeoved from the attack table, the glancing chance is always 40%.
---
Hit chance is massively influenced by the difference of defense and weapon skill. That'S why 305 skill is worth 3% hit.
---
Nice 👍🏼
---
Sorry, you can't just say you weren't being serious once you realize how stupid your idea is. Especially when you still support the stupid idea in your comment.
---
Also, "horde IQ"? You really need to get outside some. There's more to life than WoW.
---
Want some crackers with that whine kid?
---
Actually submit the report

According to wowwiki.com this change happened in 1.12.1: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.1
---
Lawl... the very first thing I addressed what the complaint against the #nochanges crowd. In fact, the entirety of my first post was about it.
---
The increase in mana gain you receive from each mana potion can be basically interpreted as " + MP5 ". You are likely better served using pure DPS trinkets such as Briarwood Reed, but you can test to find the value of MP5 for balance.
---
Rose tinted...
---
NeatPlates
---
It will also be a hilarious way to bait enemy faction
---
Well hi! There are a handful of people I miss from the Thunderfury days, and I may have tried to get them to tag along, but alas they were too invested in the server. I totally get that.
---
Are you the nelf Warrior I used to run with all the time?
---
I feel the same for any farming profession. I leave alliance alone when mining..I even let a 50 dwarf priest get a lvl on my node this morning. The free honor was tempting though...
---
How does it make sense to blame "no changes" when the biggest problem is that Blizzard *changed* server population caps? This post is so self-contradictory and stupid that it pissed me off &gt;:(
---
No shit.
---
When most of us played Vanilla we were getting an allowance. xD
---
Nor did we have the money to run more than one rig, and then that rig wasn't the top of the line.
---
I don't really find it so much with videos on yt because they are usually short, highlight reels or educational or whatever.  In wow at least. Haven't seen many huge full playthroughs or anything.
---
I have fallen into the trap before though of buying a game and just watching twitch streams and never actually playing it
---
I'm 2 for 2. The same gem though FML
---
Insect swarm is very useful in spots, on Garr or Golemagg offtank targets for example when they have 30-60 sec of doing nothing until the boss dies.  Extra avoidance for the tank is never a bad thing and the mana cost is quite low. 
---
Boomkins will go OOM quickly, so your goal is to downrank just enough to end the fight at zero mana with mana pot / rune or even innervate consumed.  Most boss fights of course won't require a rune necessarily but sometimes if it's really close you want to pull out all the stops. 
---
So only downrank enough to get the job done!
---
Too much cry for nothing. I always shackle ghosts while in Scholo. Shackle and Loss. I found many tanks complaining about that, but after a while they understood that this is way safer. There are many reasons and many packs in this game where pulling as a priest would benefit the team, the can be for shackle or due to how fast a SWP can pull a mob since its an insta pull skill.
---
All this "mimimimi" comes from the fact that tanks feel less important when they are not pulling, and thats it.
---
Are you scouting him out? Thats what I did me and a druid friend each scouted out our own IDs untill we found him, took me 5 kills to get it. Just each scout 4 times if he still isnt there do a regular UD run while waiting for reset then go again!
---
Or they consider that change "content" and will bring it in phase 6. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
\&gt;  If they are putting in the same amount of time, 
---
They're not, and that's the entire point of his post. Sure, total time /played is 20 days, but one of them was playing for several hours a day minimum, and other was playing for 20-30 minutes a day on average. This is why he specifically mentioned the discrepancy with regards to real world time, and stated that WoW rewards concentrated time commitments.
---
Can't read it at work, but yeah any item with an effect like that you treat it as MP5 it is fairly common knowledge. That being said, I don't think any such trinket would be good, but I could be wrong.
---
Because combat is awesome at 29, you get improved gouge, ss, sprint, and (very important) Riposte. With everyone rolling locks and hunters you get procs for days from their pets and imp sprint is a big fuck you to mages and hunters tryng to kite you. Zealot blade is way better than the butcher, it does look cooler tho and has agi  on it, but if I recall correctly not even with +15 agi on it come close to the Zealot's top end dmg wich means higher SS and Riposte. Same with daggers, claw of the shadowmancer has way more top end dmg than the next option, throw +5 weapon on it and it hurts like a mofo.
---
It's true you get more crit from agi but tbh you are going to have a big crit % anyway so you can spare the 15 agi for crusader (heal and 100 ap) wich is way better imo.
---
The off hand its basically a stat stick and has to be fast for poison applications.
---
That's a night elf.
---
Night elves can't be paladins.  And you got feared by intimidating shout.
---
What am I missing here?
---
They weren't a bug, they just used to have no stack limit and once blizzard realized how stupid that was they added a limit of 5. Still hurts as you can see.
---
The #nochanges guys are the worst and I wish the devs hadn't caved in to them. What they failed to realise was that you can totally not change the game, but the experience will never be the same as it was because WE have changed. We know everything about the game now, we know when content is coming and exactly what it is. We know how to capitalise on and abuse the system. No changes was a pipedream that we let people push through because they kicked and screamed about it. The game is fantastic, but it needs changes because we have all changed.
---
The Reshade preset can be saved and uploaded/given to someone else. You tweak the settings in-game and it saves to a txt file, I gave it to a mate but a couple of the settings like the sharpening looked horrible on his at 1080p as I run it at 4k. I reccomend tweaking it yourself, the only Reshade settings I used was only "Adaptive Sharpen", "AmbientLight" and "FakeHDR" and just tweaked them to my taste.
---
I play horde on heartseeker. I guess I knew what I was getting into and enjoy it. I feel bad for the people zerging all day with no one to kill. It must be boring.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the responses 👍🏽
---
Bloodfang or Earthshaker, I CAN'T DECIDE!
---
Sacred Flame is of course. Best guild on the server but they are pretty exclusive in the recruitment process.
---
How many runs if I may ask, "Trying for 3 months" doesnt mean much if a try is one run per week, did 88 runs for my Banthok Sash, was going insane myself haha
---
hopefully it's not a repeat of US-earthfury : a almost 50-50 server who's now 65-35 due to all the ally transfers.
---
So here's what needs to happen for Shazz. Your mages need to suck it up and realize that them being on decurse duty 100% to let the melee DPS and only take 500 damage from arcane explosion that can easily be healed will get the boss killed *way* faster and easier than them doing 150 dps to a boss that gives himself a magic resistance buff. Then your healers need to keep the melee alive. I know for a lot of guilds it can be easier to just have them be ranged, but honestly imo sticking to that kind of tactic is going to make it difficult to adapt to other situations where you don't have the choice to be overly cautious.
---
I've talked to a bunch of Blaumeux xfers, and each one has been super happy about the switch
---
it's probably possible with testing yes
---
a part of me is thinking they legitimately want classic to be empty by 2021 so that they can just focus on retail again. rushing through phases and cutting classic support staff are pretty big indicators.
---
It’s only niche because it rarely has expansions where it’s useful.
---
Only reed provide a large portion of sp in one slot though, besides the Ephemeral trinket from MC. So prebis wise you're working with.. Mindtap Talisman? Burst of knowledge adds less than half the amount Reed does, so I feel it's quite outclassed in its slot. Mind of the Beast is quite nice though, 2% spellcrit is dense, but choosing it is negating the huge trinket for tanking that is Mark of Tyranny, which is a nice side business for raids.
---
Alchemist's Stone adds 33% effectiveness to potions. Average major mana pot per minute is 900 mana. So the average mana gain is 270, which translates to 54 mp/5. It certainly looks stronger than Mindtap Talisman's 11mp/5, assuming certain conditions are met:
---
You use mana pots on cd, and only mana.
---
You don't 'overheal' mana, wasting the benefit.
---
You're just repeating yourself because you're too stupid to form an actual argument. Not once have you actually responded to anything I've said.
---
What a pathetic person you are. Spend some more time crying online cause you're shit at a video game and have nothing else in your shitty excuse for a life.
---
On northdale they were 60g 
---
Highest that I saw (when there was like 14k concurrent online)
---
By the end they were 45g
---
Before p2, lotus were 90-105g on incendius, now they are 65-70g
---
Very weird because we were two layers until the end, but one layer lotuses are cheaper by nearly 1/3.
---
Idk what's gunna happen, but Im hoping they go back up as I have 12 stacks of lotus banked from p1 (been raid logging since wpvp makes the world slightly less enjoyable lol)
---
I'm sure they are. Blaumeux is now the one that's lopsided.
---
Honestly, just buy a couple of Greater Arcane Protection Potions, grab a healthstone from a warlock, and let your healers know what you're doing, and just charge in there.
---
Honestly, based on how fast our last kill went, I'm tempted to have all melee charge in right at the start. Its possible we'll kill him before the first teleport. The arcane explosion only hits for 1200-1500, so it can be healed through in the short term. But if you guys aren't killing Shazzrah quickly enough, you'll burn your healer's mana to nothing far too quickly.
---
The appeal isn't watching the game, the appeal is laughing at their jokes and personality.
---
Oh great... another one of these post. Quick reset the counter back to 0.
---
Nobody is talking about most efficient. We're talking about people that somehow make it to level 60 and have no understanding of their class or the game, and have no motive to google even the most basic details.
---
I don't play WoW to be the most efficient person in the game, but I also am not a clueless robot who spams trade chat asking which spells to train and asking for mount money at level 40.
---
This. 
---
Gnomes are the worst alliance race. Most likely to gank you when you're engaged with multiple mobs, or gank you after you clearly left them alone. I left an afk gnome rogue alone yesterday morning next to a mining node. Right as I go to the node he comes back, stealths and blows all CDs to kill me. Never again..
---
* Elaborat.  Specifically on the context of naming players to shame them. 
---
* How would be beneficial to this subreddit?
---
Often enough that he had to make a reddit post lol
---
Seems unlikely, as that involves "modifying" our characters by retroactively granting riding skills to those that own epic mounts. And going by the article it seems that players that bought their mounts in advance and didn't level up before the patch got fucked over by it.
---
The real irony is that back in the day I wanted to be efficient, but was terrible. Today, I can be efficient, but I'm taking my time. I don't know what you want to do with that information, but there it is.
---
Then what’s your brilliant solution? Sharding is the best idea the Blizzard designers came up with in 15 years. You’re telling me you have something better?
---
I think there's a bit of player age weighing in too. A lot of the people playing Classic are doing so for the vanilla nostalgia, and that means they're at least 13\~ years older than when they started playing, and as we age, we start putting more value in *efficient* gameplay, because we don't usually have 6 hours a day to just dick around.
---
Then keep killing him. He obviously enjoys coming back, make it miserable for him.
---
Yes not dying in a stun definitely ruined pvp
---
"Goodjob" recognized the name
---
Once again showing you have no clue what you're even talking about. Do have a nice day, being a real gamer chad and not some stream-watching beta peasant ;
---
When will people realize both factions act the same in PvP.....
---
Back in the day all I did was PVP, I was in a PVP guild (big up to Gank or Die Trying) on Xavius) and as a guild we ruled WSG and AB and it was awesome, but it took a lot of dedication but not complete no lifing. BG's were the most time efficient way to grind honour and speed running WSG flags with freedom pots and druids or stacked out T2 tanks in full wrath was the way to go. Every one had their roll and it wasn't the usual chaos you would see in WSG PUGs.  A group hunted the flags down and another group kept our flag moving, dedicated hunter in our flag room laying traps and slowing their flag carrier reporting which exit they had taken to ensure the intercept crew went the right way. IF you wanted rank 14 there was no pissing about, you all had a role to play and there was no casual farming noobs in the middle of the BG.  We had a rota and we ensured that if someone was going for 14 that week they had obtained the highest honour of the entire guild and we cycled people in and out of the WSG groups to ensure it happened.  you would occasionally get a complete no lifer who shared accounts and ran solo 24/7 just farming kills, they couldn't match our honour pull but could slow down progress so we just recruited them and gave them and us an easier life. 
---
Did I get Rank 14? nope! I got rank 13 and sadly had to start a new job which meant I couldn't dedicate the time to getting the last rank with only 1 week to go, I was gutted slightly as I didn't get Grand Marshall Rank but the weapons didn't matter to me so much as I had fortunately gotten Raggys Hand, big shout out to Boddah from dubai who passed on all MC gear just to reserve the eye of sulphurous, he had paid Chinese farmers for Gold so he could buy all the materials for the mace only for the eye to never drop for him. he got so annoyed that he bought a warrior who had the mace and full tier 2 for like £2000 only for the eye to drop the following week. I got the eye and Boddah logged back onto Boddah and gave me all the mats to make the mace. one word! HERO!!!

Outside the portals is never too bad for Horde - ive rarely been ganked when resetting North or East, or when opening the door etc.  Its the point right at the entrance, at the top of the ramp, that seems to be Alli controlled most of the time. That and the bridge.
---
Because it wasnt about time commitment on content, but was instead about what content was being cleared.  Believe it or not, but back in 2004-05, Molten Core was actually fairly difficult:  the 'herding cats' aspect of 40 man raids combined with game mechanics specific to group content (like threat, etc.) was all extremely new to people who hadn't played a prior mmo, of which there were few.  
---
With 15 years of experience in group oriented games, the mechanics involved in MC and BWL are a bit of a joke.  But back then not so much to the vast majority of WoW players.
---
No idea how to solve unbalanced servers, but it'd be a good start if people wouldn't think transferring away, worsening the problem on the old AND new server, would be a solution.
---
I'm not sure, it's an rp PVE server, it's not like it's crazy world pvp. But it may. I think it's impossible to say really.
---
&gt;We use two pots. We pop one while killing trash after geddon so that it's off cooldown again to use again mid fight.
---
I'd recommend against using a 2nd gapp unless your decursers are really on top of it. If you're cursed an arcane explosion will eat right through that. A restorative potion will do *a lot* more in negating damage and helping your mages/druids on decurse duty.
---
Talk to me when you hit rank 48+ when you are camped by 60 gank squads ;) 
---
Can you take the heat like I did with no complaining?  Or will you quit the game like thousands of others have done.
---
Are you strong or are you weak? We will see.
---
You sound mad
---
Been killing rag and ony since week 3, still have yet to see a single warrior weapon drop, at least valor chest is just a set completion piece and doesnt impact ur raid performance. Im unable to parse because warrior weapon is the biggest bottleneck of dps there is
---
Is it directly effecting you? Prob not, so why not just move on and mind your own business.
---
He’s an entrepreneur
---
I did 300 +/- arena runs for my Savage man. Just happens that way sometimes :)
---
"(which they are probably too cowardly to do)" aka. unless Horde risk putting themselves in the very situation the Alliance are transferring out of, what a moronic comment. 
---
Surely a better idea would be the Alliance contacting some major guilds on Horde to try organise a last minute mass exodus to balance out a server? Horde might have been too cowardly to open a dialogue though..
---
Good. I don't know how much longer i can take it to be honest. Death after death after death just trying to get basic shit done on my server. Completely 100% over it.
---
What's the difference between [@cursor] and [mouseover]?
---
What makes them fall off?
---
Lmao, you have to be joking. And I already stated my solution in my original comment. But if you like sharding then I wouldn't expect you to know how to read very well. Go back to retail.
---
The social life is what he craves.
---
This actually puts things into perspective and needs its own sticky.  Blizz fcked up, bad.
---
So they can't open it until it automatically opens, hence "have fun opening it."
---
As a warrior he also might get bre and go full 2h fury since it's better
---
TukUI has a discord for support and updates.  If you can't get help here I'd check it out.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
This is what kills me about all these people who want "Classic+" (which doesn't even make sense to think is a possibility) - the same company that people bitch killed the game in the first place want them to also create new content for Classic... which would probably kill it.
---
What's this shit about retail AV too? Yes, original AV was hardcore but that's also what was cool about it - you didn't have to play the whole thing. One day I got in a new AV before school and when I got home from school ended up in the same AV. Even if they wanted to go with the slightly nerfed version where they decreased the power of all the NPCs by 30%, that would be alright. But instead they went with the garbage zerg rush one that has 10% of the original NPCs all at 70% power. At least do a good version of AV for a little bit.
---
Devs just show time and again that they have no idea how to make a good world anymore and think everyone wants to pack all the content into a casual 30 minute log-in. I have obligations IRL, I can't spend hours on WoW, but that shouldn't mean that things that take a long time should just be gone from the game.
---
They scale the worst of any class in the game.
---
Are you gatekeeping classes in wow?
---
My wife often thought about buying one for me, but the shipping was also $100+ so a total of like $220 for a stupid robe x'D
---
cool, I might go priest.
---
Imagine caring about parsing in MC...
---
I just want to relax, kill my mobs one at a time, and veg out.
---
Not have panic inducing pvp moments every 15 seconds.

---
Top 10 bruh moments
---
Excluding sharding/server caps for the moment, Do you think any of those things which really aren't changes but more of an awkward place to begin, are the cause of the issues classic has right now?  This is kind of the point, there are plenty of minor changes which aren't causing an issue.  Some of the itemization made casters better now than they were at this point in vanilla, but I don't think it's a problem.
---
That leaves layering/sharding and server populations as changes which are left.  Private servers often had server pops on par with the larger classic servers and yet people use them as examples of things done right.  The issue can't be server pop then can they?  How are private servers "done the right way" when shit like Nostalrius probably had higher concurrent player counts.
---
Private servers had faction queues!  Yes well, people also weren't paying to play the game.  Paying to play classic and then not being able to play because there aren't enough alliance playing either has no effect or people just quitting.  You can say quitting solves the problem, but that isn't what Blizzard wants.  Queues also don't persuade people to transfer in numbers large enough to make a difference.  Yes it solves a particular problem, but it also creates new problems.
---
The reality is the reintroduction of layering or sharding works to better solve the problem with minimizing the additional issues created.  It allows world pvp to continue on a more balanced playing field while not simply banning horde from being able to log on.  Yes they won't all get to roam in their gank squads to get honor, but faction queues prevent that as does killing all the alliance until they quit.

This method is pretty stable.  When I had someone powerlvling my alt we were getting very consistant 12 min runs, which then 4 people x 4g each per run comes out to 80g then just add the coin drops (not accounting for the item drops because vendoring takes up time and it's probably not worth it)

As a brand new 60 running my first molten core/ony on Saturday, what consumables should I prepare to bring? Flasks, runes, pots, food, water, etc? I’m a resto shaman and I don’t have all my pre raid BIS yet but my guild is basically clearing everything with ease at this point.
---
I have to admit for awhile on classic I was guilty of this too. You'll have to forgive me it's been a very long time (years) since I've come across truly new players and it's taken some time to remember they need a little instruction and guidance and most importantly patience.
---
can you take 40 people through ubrs?

Honestly after watching Thrall's metamorphosis through retail, I feel better having him as warchief in classic.
---
&gt;Throw in some morons in the middle that blame Blizzard for fuck knows what. I really can't comment on this one, I just can't wrap my head around this reasoning at all...
---
... when in reality...
---
... you should thank the #NoChanges morons for this entire mess.
---
If Blizz actually made this #nochanges, we would have Vanilla populations. Also, Blizzard had options to control faction disparity. How are communities going to control their own population and faction balance? The only case where that’s remotely possible is on Faerlina, where the community is directly linked in with each other at large, as a streamer megaserver. 
---
So Blizz goes #changes for this and then you say why blame Blizzard, it’s the #nochanges that’s wrong.
---
When I was getting powerleveled on my alt I went 8 hours straight with 1 dude and he had a full party the whole time.  When someone had to go the spot was filled immediately
---
Consider Dragonfang! I know the vast majority of you would be considering other servers however Dragonfang still has a great community and is far more vanilla-like than any of the other transfer servers. World boss contention is still up for grabs (other than one alliance guild), along with easy Scarab Lord contention. The balance on this server is pretty good at around 55:45, however we would definitely love some PvP oriented horde to get a perfect balance.
---
If this sounds like something you’ll be interested in feel free to drop into our server discord, we recently had a 100+ member guild transfer from Gandling so for any guilds that have any questions they can give their opinions

A lot of people have played on and off for the last 15 years. I think that some of those people forget that there are new players.
---
same as US-earthfury: a 50-50 server turned into a 65-35 server cause of allys flee'ing their server.
---
The thing is though, once BG's come out the entire system is going to get tossed around. Some of the people at the top now may not be able to compete in BG's as they will be forced into somewhat fair fights. Some of the people that could be their potential top competition may not have started serious PvP yet but will in BG's. 
---
&gt;I belive the OP is aiming the post more towards the casual players that with pushing as much ranking as they can in between raiding, gold farming and IRL commitment stil have not reached more then rank 3-4 at this point. And for them BG's wont change much. Yes, they will move from WPvP to BG's, but the time they have to invest in it will stil be the same that they invested into WPvP.
---
I think this is the main take away. If you're pouring hours into it and you've just now made it to rank 3, you're not going to go far. However, I'm sure there are plenty of people like me who just hit rank 2 and all I've been doing is engaging in PvP as I quest (and at lvl 45). Has no bearing on what my PvP situation will be like at 60 when I actually want to start doing it.
---
&gt; modern player constantly complains “there’s nothing to do”
---
There's still plenty to do, if you're not spending hours upon hours on end a day in the game. Which is a choice, and I get that, but one of the reasons I was hype for classic is that the relatively static nature of it means you're uniquely positioned (as opposed to retail) to just take your time and eat through the content slowly. I'm only just about to ding 60, and have plenty of end-game dungeons, pvp and maybe some raiding to muck around with, which will keep me occupied for, hopefully, probably, another 6+ months easily, not to mention a couple alts sprinkled in for good measure. 
---
Everyone talks about how we should have seen the pvp situation coming, but no one should be surprised that going manic through content for a 15 year old game would exacerbate the content lulls that existed even back in vanilla, either.
---
more saturation = more good
---
Noggenfogger transfers are horde only so alliance have to slowly quit instead of mass migration...
---
What am I supposed to respond to? You haven't said anything besides personal attacks on me.
---
Alexa, play Fortunate Son.

What?
---
Blizzard doesn't "Want to give the classic experience".... They want to give as little support to classic as possible to have as much of a return on investment as possible.
---
Reckoning, turning a paladin into an even memery enh shaman.
---
how to pvp as alliance on a horde dominated server:
---
make sure to stock up on consumables. sappers, faps, invis potion
---
get into brm on a raid day, bring 9 guildies.
---
preferably: 6x mages, 1x hunter, 1x priest, 1x paladin, 1x flex spot (rogue for extra scouting, additional healer/mage/warlock)
---
blow up masses of horde raids.
---
enjoy your easy 6k+ honor / hour and horde tears in your realm discord.

Nonsense, and I'll tell you why:

---
A fisherman may not be actively fighting you, but every fish he catches is another quiver in the enemy's arsenal. Fish are what make Free Action Potions, a staple of PVP consumables. They also provide valuable 'well fed' buffs to the enemy for the content they're raiding, enabling them to complete content that much easier,  become geared  that much easier, and subsequently kill you in world pvp that much easier.         
---
           
---
When you leave a fisherman alive to do their thing, you're signing the death warrant of an ally down the road.

Now if there were a place where all you could catch were non-reagent, non-food grey fish with no vendor value? Sure I'd leave those guys alone. But there isn't, so they gots to die.
---
Orgrim
---
&gt;  but others just thought they knew better or thought that's what they wanted.  
---
"You think you want it, but you don't"
---
Waving a little white flag would be more visible.
---
As u/d07RiV said. It was intended and blizz nerfed it to 5 hit limit.
---
"Pan Shot!"
---
My server is medium pop by these standards and they are still 40-45g apiece.  This is during MC when most people don't feel a need to flask. 
---
They will get a lot more expensive once higher raid tiers launch.  There are only so many to go around.  Supply is constant, but demand increases
---
No. Modern Mak gora has no rules on what you can use
---
Before phase 2, yes the sense of danger and uncertainty added to the excitement. Now it's just corpse runs after corpse runs because 3-5 man ganksquads wouldn't leave me alone when I solo farmed or ran to a dungeon. That's not exciting at all.
---
Sounds like Horde won the war.
---
At this stage in the game, should I make a rogue or warrior alt? I primarily want to get him to 60 for PvP
---
Or how about totemic recall that I constantly get asked about?
---
I'm zug zugging with some old buddies on Pagle. Which is like 80/20 alliance. I need to hit 60 so I can get these motherfucking alliance out of my motherfucking Orgrimmar!
---
I feel like this has to be trolling, but if not that's a pretty delusional way to look at it.
---
&gt;Like I told you in my very first post: no it wasn't obvious that it would be that bad and was rarely presented like this.
---
Errr what? There were literal warnings like this one https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bc6xq6/the_argument_for_adding_wsg_in_phase_2/ and this doesn't even take faction imbalance into account.
---
&gt;with stories about how world PvP in Vanilla was the best
---
Maybe it was with the community of vanilla but the mentality has changed and it was the main reason.
---
&gt;how many players with an average 2 hours playtime
---
Why are you giving a retail audience as an example? They were never meant for classic or classing was never meant for them. You aren't supposed to have a comfortable level of playstyle with this amount of time ingame. I am a bloody casual but still my /played is 35 days.
---
&gt;to fight against 300 hardcore player pvping all day, you need 1200 average players to match their presence.
---
That's slightly wrong. You need 1200 scrubs who have no place in this game and are bound to be the victims of natural selection. 
---
&gt;the majority of players don't like the state of PvP at the moment
---
Again, you point is "the majority of (alliance) players are bad and not hardcore, this is why they are farmed as honor livestock by the minority of (horde) players". While I won't argue with that, good luck explaining it to the players who are farmed.
---
&gt;I mean are you having fun ganking people 5vs1? spending day at flypath? killing people trying to get to BRD 4 times to get all your honor?
---
I don't do it since I don't care. People who do it certainly have fun.
---
They seem to hold the MC BRD entrance longer at raid times, but the UBRS and the mountain entrances are more Horde controlled in my experience.
---
From someone that quit retail after Cata, can you explain zone sharding?
---
Nosir I am not. I also rolled TF on its first day, as a since wc2 I rolled on vanilla launch day so knew the problems the first servers would have. However my wife wanted to play (but not as much) so I kept my main with her and leveled alts. It was pure nostalgia until about two weeks before phase 2, great world pvp that reminded me of the old days so i'm glad she was able to experience that (she still talks about winning a 2v2 we had in STV and being chased by an orc while we were running through the barrens) but it's been pretty shit for about a month. Before you had a chance to turn the tide on a ganker but now there's four more that will show up right after you turn to fight. Glad it's looking good for you folks on AR though, can't beat the vanilla experience.
---
Well currently we have cross realm phasing in retail, which wont probably be in classic, since the backlash on phasing, so i guess server merging faction inbalanced servers is most likely option
---
Yeah it'd be awful if only a few horde moved, and then ended up stuck on a server that \*slightly\* tilted Alliance (Earthshaker is about 55% Alliance atm). How could they possibly be brave enough to do such a thing?
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure most of them will just sit in safety on Flamelash and brag about how good they are at PVP and how they beat all the Alliance noobs with their superior skillz.
---
The few Horde that have moved over are the few people who have put their money where their mouth is, and I've got a lot of respect for them going to where proper PVP is actually going to happen rather than taking the easy way out.
---
Yeah, basically the item with the best stta and sockets. That belt in question IIRC had 3 socket hence why it was so good.
---
lol, wait, am I reading the correctly?  You guys killed him in 22 seconds?
---
Let me tell you what I did. I was constantly told to level my warlock to 60 BEFORE P2 hits. Right now my warlock is at 43. I was looking at the situation on reddit regarding ganking and how unplayable the game has become, and being on a horde dominated server as alliance - I rerolled. Made a rogue on a PvE server and havent looked back, havent even logged onto Herod in literal months.
---
Lmao “it’s actually impossible to get rank 14 in less than 12 weeks even if you’re the top player in your faction” man RIP to my life when I go for that grind
---
Ye but below it goes on to point out that it's not certain what happens to people that only have pvp mounts, or only drop mounts.
---
Imagine thinking this and then tyling this.
---
In general it's better to play on server with more people on your faction.  
---
More money circulating in the server -&gt; more money you could earn from AH -&gt; easier for you to pay off for static prices like skills and mount.
---
I'm pretty sure it kicks you out
---
The community has drastically changed, the minmaxing mentality is a thing.
---
Back in the Vanilla days, I had this same issue on the pants. And once they dropped a pally in t1 gear Ninja'd them. I was farming them from around BWL or VG release till about 1.11 I think. 
---
I finally got my drop for myself on my completed Baron 45 run.
---
It's BiS.
---
WAOW you are so good
---
too bad in less than a week every realm will be destroyed by the overpopulated horde realms thx to xrealm battlegrounds
---
Interesting. I just started playing wow a couple months ago and rolled a pally, but every guide said the reckbomb build wasn’t worth doing anymore
---
&gt;Requiring overall game balance is such an obvious core requirement, I don't know how Blizzard couldn't realize the importance of it.
---
The really bad thing in all of this is they let far too many people migrate from realms in Vanilla and it fucked things up massively. Apparently learning lessons is for other companies.
---
It’s not that serious you fucking nerds
---
We had one of our healers get feared into the wall and out of existence last week.
---
I just got OEB and I’m simply ecstatic. But I’m just PUG’in anyways. I know BRE or even Spinal is way better. But my drive to get them has more than halved. I just wana PVP BG style and not be gimped (as a War you NEED a legit Wep). So each phase I’ll probably just get the “trash” 2 Hander from each raid and be more than happy!
---
It's alright on a warrior.  You can test how fast you can do a run and then start selling them after you know how quickly you can do it.  I can usually do armory in \~12 mins not counting herod
---
This post was made by an ally FL player trying to get hordies out
---
Starting ungrouped was a thing in early patches but pretty sure we should be automatically grouped now. Although AV in particular had a bug where occasionally you wouldn't be grouped, I remember it occurred in much later expansions as well.
---
\#nochanges were the cry babies this time, and they definitely had a large effect. In fact, I'd argue nothing to combat faction imbalance was because of them. Just because they didn't win on server size doesn't mean they didn't overall win.
---
So you still haven't addressed their points, try again.
---
As a troll you only need 6% hit with rhok.
---
Ony neck 1
---
T1 shoulder 1
---
T1 gloves 2
---
2 agi rings 2%
---
Hinterlands trinket 1
---
It s easy af to get 6.
---
Yes i was mainly talking about horde players on flamelash since alliance hasnt been strong enough to put up a fight recently on flamelash.
---
Not that much has changed. Players are probably better on average, mostly cause they’re older now, but to suggest world pvp didn’t still consist of groups roaming zones to farm honor is ridiculous. People weren’t content fucking around for hours on end and killing 3 people as you say, there was still an intense honor grind back then with people spending 12-14 hours a day killing people.
---
The problem here, and the difference since vanilla, is the larger player base. That’s it
---
I hate #nochanges I wish they had old school runescapes model.
---
go back to what was great about classic, but change it to make it it's own game, no a 1 for 1 clone.
---
ie. keep 40 mans, but potentially create new ones on a couple years. don't increase the level cap, don't make a PvP only stat, don't add dungeon finder.
---
but still change things. especially if new methods break the game
---
Based. Fuck undead mages.
---
Idk... I'm having fun. And I'm not in either boat. I'm not 8v1'ing and I'm also not being camped.
---
so everything is working fine 
---
"(estimates don’t account for diminishing returns)"
---
people also need to understand this , when you are sitting in a raid generally killing the same people multiple times each kill is 25% less and after 5 kills they are worthless honour wise to you for 24 hours 
---
this means the estimate calculates all 5 kills at 100% not 75% 50% 25% 0%
---
so unless you only gank unique players 1 time per day your estimate will be off possibly by  quite a lot
---
If there was an imbalance it never showed. SkullCrusher EU here and there was always action and people from both sides winning back and forth. And never shit like today.  
---
What they do? Do i really need to say what has been asked a bazillion times? They have the metrics, if metrics show 60-40 pop balance on the server then add a damn queue for one side. Limit de character creation for the side that has a surplus. Open migrations to the side that has the most players and not vice-versa. And so many other shit that could of done.   
---
But no, they watched and didn't gave a single fuck.
---
This can be done entirely server-side, too. It's a non-trivial modification, sure. But so is enabling PvP in Silithus, or EPL.
---
I'm a resto shaman and here's what I bring to every raid night, in what I'd call order of importance:
---
Major mana potions (I end up using about 10 per MC but bring 20 for safety, but honestly you could almost certainly get away with just using superior mana potions)
---
Greater fire protection potions (at least 2 for Rag and 2 for Onyxia, prepot one before the boss and use the other when the first runs out, bring more if your guild can't consistently one-shot them)
---
Dark runes or demonic runes (theyre interchangable, they share a cooldown with each other but not with mana pots, so use one when you need more mana and your major mana pot is on cooldown, I use about 5-8 per MC and 1-2 per Onyxia)
---
Nightfin soup (I bring a full stack for safety but only use one for each boss)
---
Greater shadow protection potion (I prepot one for Majordomo)
---
Restorative potions (I use one on Lucifron when I get Lucifron's Curse and one on Baron Geddon to get rid of Ignite Mana but if you aren't bad like me you can avoid the latter)
---
Greater arcane protection potion (I prepot one for Shazzrah)
---
Gordok green grog (I use one on any boss where I'm likely to take significant damage, so, onyxia, shazzrah, majordomo, and rag pretty much)
---
I wouldn't bother using a flask of distilled wisdom on this raid content, it's helpful, but I can't justify the expense, personally.
---
Are you referring to the tauren getting obliterated, or something I totally didn't see?
---
for almost 13 years i have heard people complain about how "flying mount killed the world pvp"
---
now im hearing "its to much world pvp you cant do anything"
---
in 5 days when BGs lanches i will hear "world pvp is dead"
---
A multiboxer with 10 chars has 9 bots
---
Demonshear seems better at first glance largely due to its slower attack speed. If it's shadow bolt can crit I believe it can also proc Vengeance as well.
---
Glancing blows means you deal 70% normal damage. Only melee can have a chance for glancing blows. With weapon skill 310, your glancing blows deals 100% normal damage. +10 * 3% +70% = 100%. So you still have a 40% chance for glancing blow. So yes technically, you can't remove glancing blows from the attack table.  Just removing the penalty.
---
Range attacks can't be dodge, parry or glance. Only blocked or miss. 
---
But I was mistaken with my above comment. The troll racial passive actually only gives 1% hit chance.
---
Meh fuck all these blumpkin catchers. Report him to twitch aswell.
---
I dont accept your dismissal of all but one of my points.  The fact is that blizz has proven more than willing to make dozens of game-altering changes,  and as such placing the blame on the nochanges crowd for the current state is fallacious given blizz's very clearly demonstrated disregard for the nochanges philosophy.  Blizzard had complete power and authority to fix all of the current issues before they even became issues, and all of the research material necessary to identify these potential issues well ahead of time.  They chose not to.
---
Yeah I get why you would be concerned given that this exact approach created the most successful MMO of all time. It probably wouldn't work, true.
---
1) Log out before res and log back in
---
2) /laugh and use the 'n o h o n o r' macro
---
I just hit Deadwind pass and kill birds/ogres. I do that for gold sometimes anyway. On Whitemane I rarely encounter any horde, and the respawn times are great.
---
okay that would be cheap shot and kidney shot most of the time, i.e. the one class warriors can often kill in a 1vs1 situation.  (BoP is pretty rad for dispelling kidney shot btw)
---
Wow, thanks for giving away free water for free
---
dont worry about expensive enchants at level 19. you will be replacing your gear very quickly so enchanting its not really worth it. there are some cheap 1 damage ones you can get if you want to
---
This.
---
There's more than 10 days of /played on my now-abandoned level 56 shaman. I'm on PvE now just enjoying doing the quests and exploring the zones again ... and that seems to go against the grain.
---
I tried asking people in guild chat if anyone else needed to do elite quests in \[area\], and everybody was all like "protip: open quest log, abandon. It's a waste of time".
---
It's like getting to the point where all you can do is raidlog and complain about lack of content is the most important thing there is.
---
I don't get it. But well, I'll keep noobing around and have fun with that.
---
&gt; ... when in reality...  
---
We wanted Vanilla...and among the NO FUCKING CHANGES, it was the FUCKING VANILLA-LIKE POPULATION CAPS.
---
And yes, I use caps, because you are the moron, not the #nochanges crowd.,
---
We asked for Vanilla-like population caps, maybe SLIGHTLY higher, like 3.5k concurrent.
---
What Blizzard provided was a layering system, based on a 90% drop-off rate, which would (in Blizzard's idiotic mind) assure a Vanilla-like population after the layering is removed.
---
But hey, guess what happened : the drop-off was more like 30%. We were telling Blizzard that Classic will be HUGE...they didn't listened, nor believed us. We were telling Blizzard that the drop-off will be minimal...they didn't listened, nor believed us.
---
Hence, this happened : when layering **HAD** to be removed, most Classic servers had 3-5 layers full of people, which translated into 9k to 15k concurrent players / server.
---
&gt; Throw in some morons in the middle that blame Blizzard for fuck knows what 
---
It is 100% Blizzard's fault for being morons. If you don't understand MATH, you are the moron. You cannot throw 10k players into a world designed for 3k, and expect things to go well.
---
Blizzard, either because they are stupid as you are, either intentionally, fucked up Classic, with their "wisdom" ( launching with 33 servers worldwide, ending up with 4 times more ; expecting a drop-off of 90% -how the hell they got to this conclusion, I have no idea- and ending up with a 3 times less drop-off).
---
So, to sum up :
---
\-it's 100% Blizzard fault
---
\-#nochanges applied EXCEPT population caps, which fucked up everything
---
\-and the moron are you for not understanding basic math and logic
---
Is why I'll shine a light on it so I can move on. Entrepreneurial con artist.
---
Name and shame works wonders.
---
Long time ago during WotLK I was on one server and this ninja looter decided to do his thing. People called him out on that shit and ruined his entire reputation. People blasted him for about 4 hours. People even started adding him to their friends list so even if he changed his name he wouldn't get away with anything. He stopped playing or changed servers a while later but people still remember his name a year after.
---
So I changed serves to play with a friend and that server had no such culture to name and shame. There were ninja looters everywhere. People were getting ninja looted left and right every 2-3 days. There was a web page dedicated to naming a few ninja looters but it didn't help because they didn't nip that in the bud early enough.
---
That server was so garbage with assholes there were people who ninja loot on THE FIRST BOSS in ICC. Once a ninja looter got into my friend's guild and I told him he was a ninja looter but he didn't care. The ninja looter ninja looted from his own guild.
---
I even learned new styles of ninja looting. Such as ninja looting a mount you already have and auctioning the mount to the highest bidder. We couldn't even disband and continue the raid that week as the ninja looter team stayed in the instance taking up the raid ID that week.
---
You need a zero tolerance culture on ninja looting. Or you end up like the garbage server NOOB'bei Thos.
---
Basically blizzard crams people from different servers into zones so there are more people "in the world".  Let's say you are on a small server and you go to burning steppes.  You are alone and run around and see nothing but NPCs.  If the zone was sharded there would be players from other servers in the zone as well.  You can interact with them, group with them or gank them if you want.  It was their attempt to try to bring the world back to life as people complained the world was dead.
---
The shadows and lighting are entirely different. It's most definitely not a 15yo game.
---
&gt; But, as much as reddit might argue otherwise, I think just a lot of people enjoy playing Horde over Alliance.
---
I think a big part of this too is how cool the races are. Tauren are huge, that's cool. Orcs are strong and brutish, that's cool. Undead look nasty, that's cool. Trolls are kinda lame IMO, but they still have that cool Jamaican attitude and cool tusks.
---
Night Elves are your typical fantasy Legolas kind of race, that's cool. Humans are easy to relate to but if I wanted to be a human I'd just do things IRL. They can still look cool, so +1. Dwarves are *okay*. The female dwarves look fucking horrifying, so that's out. I can *kind of* get behind the stout tough dwarf thing. Gnomes are just shit. Halflings would be cool. Gnomes, wtf? They all look stupid and they're annoying and they're so small you can't even appreciate their armor.
---
Then in TBC they give Horde anime Blood Elves so now you can be a cooler looking elf but on the Horde side. They give Alliance space goats. The only redeeming quality was that finally Horde got a bunch of kids that wanted to be leather-jacket-wearing elves.
---
I wanted to be Alliance because I like the idea of being the underdog, but I wish I looked as cool as the Undead.
---
There were multi hour queues on many servers with layering for a while after launch with layering...
---
One thing is enabling content, another is modifying character records.  Either way I highly doubt they'd be changing this in phase 6, but assuming TBC re-release would happen at some point they'll probably do it eventually.
---
Why is he a con artist?
---
Logic tells me that the amount of DPS and the top end damage on the Warblade makes it better than Demonshear. I can't really see the speed difference being that significant considering it's 58 dps vs 53. Is there a paladin damage spreadsheet out there?
---
&gt; I was, however, open to QoL and balance changes, which were (and probably still are), of course, unpopular.  
---
I understand that people don't want QoL changes since it's part of the charm of Vanilla (no flying mount, no LFR, etc...). Same for balance change, as in "nerfing what's OP", as they want their 3 minutes mages and perma-stun rogues (which I don't mind myself to be honest).  
---
But I made a thread regarding the **IDEA** of slightly buffing raiding underdogs (Balance Druid, Prot/Ret Paladin, Smite Priest, etc). People told me to go back to retail. I wrote in my post that I started WoW with Classic...
---
Those are most likely min-max guides. It probably wont be the most effective way to play pala, but it's still funny to do it tho :)
---
I'm unsure of the values you are using. The way I see it:
---
Major Mana Pot: \[1350+2251 = 3601\] / 2 = 1800.5 Mana every 2 minutes
---
Trinket: \[1800.5 \* 0.33\] = 594.165 Extra mana every 2 minutes
---
594.165 / 120 seconds = 4.95 Extra mana per second
---
4.95 \* 5 = 24.75 mp5
---
Still really good, way better than I realized. Of course, enjoy going broke from having to use Major Mana pot every fight, but I guess we are talking about what is "theoretically" possible from a Balance druid.
---
I remember Dragonmaw being one the busiest EU realms, then I came back after playing on another server and I was one of about 3 people in Org following the transfers.
---
It's good to see Blizzard learnt their lesson and put caps on the realm transfers...
---
- That looks like a solid specc. I'd probably put 5 in imp. Natures Touch  &gt; Nature's Focus but I guess that's just a personal preference.
---
- Bringing up Omen of Clarity / Cat form was just me brainstorming the edges of what a Druid can do when oom &amp; I doubt it'd ever be relevant. 
---
- I've always tried to put Innervate on Priests in raids, but they never seem to go oom, so maybe my guild could get away with me slinking an innervate on myself (or a Mage) if things don't go south, atleast in MC &amp; Onyxia that is.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll keep it in mind!
---
Savage.
---
I wouldn't worry about a Flask unless your guild expects them, MC really isnt that demanding of a place and if they're already clearing it, it's not worth it for the cost. 
---
Consumes you should bring for sure: Major Mana Pots, Dark Runes, Nightfin Soup and Greater Fire Prot. Pots are a good start.  
---
There are some world buffs you could look into getting (Gizzard Gum or Cerebral Cortex Compound).  The world buffs arent nearly as neccessary, I'd worry about the potions/runes and soup.
---
Here's a guide with more detail about where to get certain things: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/shaman-healing-consumables-classic-wow
---
Alliance-dominated PVE servers will also factor in, how much I'm not sure.
---
with massive queues on horde side lol
---
see this is quite funny. Alliance are all over this sub reddit moaning about camping and 5 - 10 v 1 situations, and here we have someone proud as punch for doing the same. 
---
As said, Alliance are just moaning cos they are outnumbered, they are quite happy doing it when its in their favor!
---
I bought the Lich king ugly sweater from blizz this year and it is actually very well made.
---
&gt; you should thank the #NoChanges morons for this entire mess.
---
This entire mess stems from two things:
---
1. Massively overpopulated servers
---
2. Extreme faction imbalance
---
#2 was exacerbated by the first wave of free transfers that weren't faction limited (every top alliance guild on Skeram went to Heartseeker, for example).
---
So it really has nothing to do with the whole "No Changes" thing.
---
100%.  People would get tired of sitting in queues and would self balance the servers.
---
Why is it than when horde does stuff like this they are assholes and ruining the game, but when alliance does it, its fun and a good tip.
---
Alliance is equally bad, it just seems like they just whine the most.
---
and my argument is exactly that, one sided participation in a social mmo is BAD on so many levels. Feeding narcissism, taking an active hobby and making into a sepctator event, people wanting to profit off it and getting money involed lol  just a waste of resources all around and it is 100% not at all like  comedy or plays you are obfuscating what I am focused on with these bad analogies, stay on topic or dont comment please.
---
&gt; Also the courtyard before you get into UC, is good for catching people heading out to the zepplin.
---
This is the best spot because the spirit rezzer is also there. They cannot even escape with a spirit res.
---
What I’m telling you I play horde and play a lot. You’re gonna have to trust me here, your brothers in arms are out there doing work. Our LFG and world chat  is filled up with people arguing about how horde just rolls over. For the past week alliance have controlled DM, EPL and everlook. Gaget is theirs half the time. Both Zeps have gank squads at them and the gates of UC are always contested. only one time I logged in this past week alliance were not camping the passage between kargath and Searing Gorge. I just recently spent my whole play time trying clear them out of DM which only happened when we summoned a whole raid in and I heard they were all back by them time I got off. I guess my point is we both give as good as we get on Incendious.
---
They should allow transfer to pve server. I'm one of those horde assholes you are talking about and nothing would make me happier than help you if I happened to see you almost dying to a mob in a pve server but unfortunately the wpvp system is dogshit and the reason I became an asshole is because you are also assholes.
---
How?
---
Stereotype that all rogues are assholes
---
&gt; So only downrank enough to get the job done!
---
I found it refreshing to see someone making a sound argument in favour Insect Swarm. Yes it's a niche spell but it does have its uses.
---
Lol I am at 600~ atm. Pretty sure they removed that item from loot table. Never seen it once.
---
You slut!
---
GFPP is required for Rag; don't bother attending without them. Mana pots, buff food and runes are expected, but not critical. Flasks are for progression nights when you're specifically trying to clear content you might not otherwise be able to do. Water and health food will be provided by mages.
---
booth right, booth wrong
---
&gt;Rogue could buy a green of equal level to caster dagger with the same DPS.
---
Not even close to being true. [Here is a list of daggers that have level requirements between 30 and 37](https://classic.wowhead.com/daggers/min-req-level:30/max-req-level:37/side:3). Notice that hypnotic blade has the highest DPS, only thing even comparable is a rare BoE.
---
Be arms or fury, there is no good reason to be protection unless u just like it. Arms is the best tank/dps dungeon spec and fury is the best raid dps spec. Furyprot is fine too if ur raid tanking but nobody actually needs to be prot. Slows ur groups down and limits ur ability to solo
---
I agree. That is why I dont level my alts anymore.
---
should have offered to cross poles
---
Something tells me your not a herbalist
---
And you as an alliance pussy is part of it too.   
---
See what i did there? Don\`t blame the players for what Blizztardians did.
---
Well, akshoe-alley
---
It happens to rogues too though just from a distance instead of at melee range. I cant even count the number of times I've been peacefully fishing and then a hunter or priest opens up on me out of nowhere..
---
This was super helpful thank you!
---
what is duality?
---
You know, Even without NS you can warstomp &gt;regrowth&gt;potion&gt;bearform with inn the stunn duration
---
YYAAAAAASSSSS!
---
My friends and I moved from Faerlina to Earthfury a week ago, another PvP East coast server. No queue, and definitely within 55/45 faction ratio. Seems like alli have a slight edge, maybe more organized, but I would encourage any horde/alli to move here. 3 hours left!
---
OP did you get some sand in your vagina?
---
This is what I was suggesting to most people who complained there at first except stealth isn't necessary.
---
Wish this was just my opinion but it's not. They are simply better on paper and even better in game too. I'm on razorgore and 50% of server population is Orcs and Undeads. That's right. NOT 50% Horde, just UD and Orcs are half of the server, guess why?
---
Plus, how many of us engage in a tryhard raiding PvP fight and how many of us engage in 1v1 situations and open world ganks?
---
+1, dungeons are the way to go with two mages.  You can find a priest healer and then either a tank or more mages.  Sometimes having fewer people is good because the pulls take longer but its easier to coordinate and not have it all go to shit.
---
SM is good though, quick corpse run and very AOE-able.
---
Rogue if u wanna have fun
---
Is there a herb somewhere in that shot? Haha nah I'm not.
---
I have 300 herbalism and working towards 300 mining. I want to get engineering (collecting mats via mining right now). Which should I drop in favor of engineering when the time is right?
---
Only 5 times?
---
Well by then people nolife honor farming will be in BGs.
---
Quite insightful
---
We don't decurse at all. Though perhaps you're right. If your fight lasts longer maybe a resto pots are a better option since you might be healable for longer.
---
In our case we kill him pretty fast so it kind of doesn't matter. Whichever is cheapest I guess. I got a bunch of GAPPs when somebody put them up for 2g a stack instead of per pot!
---
When you are scanning a sample to determine ratios it is fine. If you're tying to do full population it is weak.
---
The end user in this case was scanning a sample to determine a ratio. It works fine.
---
Very well said my friend.
---
Plus you deny the ability to disarm, rend, sunder, etc.
---
TBC will most likely release in about 1.5 years, will fix most of the mess. I'd rather leave Classic the way it is so we can skip the whole #nochange for TBC and make small changes like buff dungeons/bosses to not be a cakewalk like the raids are now.
---
Well that's because you had the AUDACITY to leave the safety of your shadows. You might not have been the rogue to have wronged them, but you are the same class.
---
Where are you basing this data from?
---
Bloodfang(78% alliance), Earthshaker(66% alliance), golemagg(91% alliance), Firemaw(63% alliance) and a few ~55% alliance majority/balanced one's
---
He is leaving the conversation in a polite manner. You're just being a nitpicking prick.
---
&gt; bro players don't sit down at a table and say "okay let's break our server" 
---
Just because it wasn't premeditated doesn't mean they weren't responsible.
---
go back to retail
---
Lol were the ones complaining the people in 40 man raids killing a single alliance member 10 times thinking holy shit I just got 2k honor.
---
Blizz should fuck around and reset honor at the BG launch making those honor gains useless
---
I can clarify that Winter's Chill is getting pushed off by Corruption, so that list isn't fully correct.  Its close though.
---
Yeah I bought krol blade and 50g in raid consumes a week ,at first I was respeccing from swords for raid night then back to sub for pickpocketing but that was 100g a week only did that for like 4 weeks plus 2 crusaders and I have 2 40% mounts (horse,saber) i was averaging 20-30g an hour which is kinda slow
---
Lmfao it’s a themed cookbook for a video game what were you expecting? Also did you even take the time to go look at the book online (bunch of wow themed items and recipes that emulate ones from the game) I mean we’re you expecting lore or something?
---
Stratholme UD (and live before the scarlet monastery part), the supply crates have stupid amounts of health and mana pots
---
It's pretty even on Rattlegore. 47/53 alliance /horde.
---
Coming from the private server scene , my guild and myself choose our realm wisely , with tryhards on both factions , guilds who played for severals years together and against each other , to prevent to end up on a dead realm , tryhards did not ruin your server , it are the non tryhards who choose the easy way and just switch server
---
Yeah, hit it very hard.
---
I transferred from Kromkrush to Arcanite Reaper and it's been mostly positive on the Horde side even with the imbalance. Questing is possible without having to queue for mobs and it feels much like I remembered vanilla. I've had a few PvP encounters where I've ran into the same foe again a few days later - that's the good stuff I rarely saw on the larger realm.
---
One issue is it was SUPER easy to get a dungeon run going on Krom. For me as a level 54 mage, it takes a long time or sometimes it's just not possible at all to get a BRD/ST run going. Hoping I can find a guild that does that kind of stuff on the regular as the one I'm in is raid focused and I'm not quite there.
---
I was never trying to argue that streamers are good for the game, I was telling to you the reasons why people watch them.
---
I mean, the 15 minute blessings THEMSELVES are a change from early vanilla, in which mass blessings did not even exist.

Here's the formula if u want to see where I got my spirit number from
---

---
Arcane protection potions + zerg him in 40-50 secs.
---
I'm thinking back to playing final fantasy 4, one of my favorite SNES games, on the gameboy advance. They did a better translation. They added abilities that weren't in the original US release and upped the difficulty. At the end of the game you got a gigantic dungeon with unique weapons for everyone. It was great and is now the version I always play on emulators.
---
I can't even imagine throwing a fit and saying #nochanges, because I don't like the newer direction the games took and was afraid they would ruin it.
---
Delete one then pick the other up, mail it then go to google and google wow item recovery, then go to the wow website one and recover the item you deleted
---
Blizzard hasn't mentioned how/if battlegroups will be implemented, all they have said is it will be cross-server.
---
Honest question, why do it?
---
Your literally trading your life, health, relationships, job/education, anything other than wow PvP, for gear that will probably be replaced in future tiers anyway.
---
Our guild just transferred to AR on horde side. The only downside to the server is the economy, having no big amounts of enchanting mats or things at your disposal sucks. But every other aspect of the game has been a huge increase in fun. I was a huge skeptical about coming to this server beforehand, but after two days it has been much much better. If you see &lt;knocked loose&gt; around, be ready for a fight.
---
Hold black lotus?
---
I wonder if y'all talk shit while you're running away in stealth when an actual threatening group shows up.
---
It's the people that treat having fun and knowing how to play a game as mutually exclusive that are the real problem.
---
These are the players that will never improve because they will counter any information players try  to give them with "I PLAY THIS GAME FOR FUN!"
---
Some people have a very strange attitude towards learning. I've seen a lot of people claiming they are going to make guilds that don't learn boss fights before their raids, yet you never hear about these types of guild being successful. It's fine to not be able to figure everything out yourself, and most of us can't and need to know our limitations.
---
People also need to appreciate that when participating in group activities, if they choose to not try and perform well that there's a chance other players may not be happy about it.
---
Evidently there's a balance to be struck, but it's the people that are willifully ignorant that are the worst.
---

---
Numbers dont lie. Sorry math does not agree with you.
---
If your assumption is that everybody is playing on a PvE server, then this must be the first post you actually read on this reddit I guess. That explains your confusion atleast.
---
Probably not, but i have to play with the visual settings tuned down to 2007 mode otherwise the herbs are impossible to find/covered up with the ground clutter 😄
---
Time to reroll Warrior... Nah jk too much work. I do enjoy beating warriors 1v1 with my Frost Mage
---
I've been a healer druid thus far in raids (1/29/21 spec but my raid is all set on tanks) and I usually throw IS on my tank assignment's target if it isn't the focus of the raid.  There are no debuffs (or very few) on the OT targets so why not save the tank a few hits for very low mana?  You can even use rank 1 if you want as the DPS is pointless either way.  12 seconds of 2% avoidance could mean the tank takes one less hit, which each hit in raid is ofc like 1000 hp or more.  rank 1 insect swarm to save 1000hp is a no brainer.  But of course you can't use it on focus targets because it's definitely not worth the debuff slot in that scenario. 
---
I have rank 1 IS on my bars, purely for these reasons.  In 5-mans I don't really use it because there's usually more pressing needs as a healer but maybe if you're a boomie you could put it on the non-focus target early in the pull
---
While true, you need to be in a guild of like-minded people if you want to be "surprised." The vast majority of raiding guilds will expect you to have researched the fights.

#NoChanges
---
I know Alliance side we have a few leveling and casual guilds. Those are the ones to join until you're ready to raid. Just be courteous and thankful for them when you leave, and people appreciate it.
---
I bet most of these people claiming theres nothing to do, dont even max out fishing or any rep
---
&gt; Shadow Priest racials and alliance doesn't have a counterpart
---
tbf, dwarf is the best priest class by far. I may be salty about horde racials being better in most every situation, but this one shouldn't be overlooked.
---
If someone is a min-maxer they may want the weapons since theyre the best until Naxx.
---
I don't see a reason for blizz to not ban them for player reports.  The banwave idea only really holds up for detection of the engine or something.  If you're out doing stupid shit, the bot makers aren't going to change their bot to be less "bot-like" when the user is literally online for 30+ hours straight just doing one thing.
---
No hunters do

Dude this. I have a bunch of Dota 2 shirts that are old as hell and in great condition, some of my favorite shirts. Valve definitely uses the best tshirts.
---
Looking at census results for this week it's 51% ally / 49% horde across the world.
---
Because the title is awesome and being known as a Grand Marshall/High Warlord is actually prestigious.  Everyone on the server will know you and respect you.  You do it for that reason.
---
Rip skeleton burt Reynolds
---
looks good to me
---
I solo farm. You're worth 200 to me.
---
They simply should have done progressive items. Ranker gear is too powerful to not abuse every single thing in order to get it a bit earlier. Getting into the first generation ranker premade is HUGE and that requires higher ranks asap.
---
There are no factions, just loot. And you all are in my way.
---
“How Legend of Zelda was always MEANT to look in Unreal Engine!”
---
Plus are they really all random people if you spend 8+ hours a day with them?
---
Imp FD would be better than Imp revive pet, though they both work depending on what you want. I found it really annoying to have FD be resisted, mainly at the boss.    
---
You're gonna be waiting 30 seconds for FD anyways, meaning 10 second pet revive isn't all that important.
---
Huh. I am veg-ing right out and one at a timing stuff, having a social time, and also having healthy world-pvp moments. Much of our server has ranked members. I assumed everyone else on other pve servers was also having a fun game.
---
I think pvp must mean Player vs Panic.
---
Underrated post
---
Well said.
---
Alternate tanking trinkets exist. There's a 2% dodge trinket in DM that's nearly as good, and Mark of the Chosen procs near constantly while tanking. +stats is great. In any case, you are almost certainly using Smoking Heart of the Mountain for one slot as it's amazing. 
---
HoJ takes a trinket slot for cat, BB is a \*really\* good #2 choice, so this option hurts more. But if you're primarily DPSing as moonkin, you should probably prioritize spell gear over melee dps.
---
I'm Horde on Skeram. I had a MC geared Mage. I haven't logged in since p2 hit and I found out how much Horde outnumber Alliance. I refuse to be a part of a zerg as I'm not a bitch and it's just unfun. I don't want to invest all that time into another character on a more balanced server, and I don't want to transfer to a dead server.
---
Blizzard refusing to simply allow single faction transfers to balance servers means classic just ended for me. Was fun while it lasted.
---
This
---
That was a good day.
---
This is a good frame of mind to have. I have a list of things I want, and I just make/join groups to go to any of those places. Eventually something I want will drop.
---
cringiest guild on the server with ur pimply guildmates minxmaxing pvp in BRM 15 hours a day
---
&gt;There was no problem until alliance created a whiny flash mob that claimed faction balance was the problem for getting ganked, while horde got ganked the exact same amount but didn't mobilize any flash mob, because dying in world-pvp is normal. Annoying, but normal.

All you can do is lol at shit like this

At 25+hours/week, you'll be 60 before BWL...

# &lt;Ella Grace&gt; - Horde  ·  Sulfuras  · PvP  · Social, leveling &amp; dungeoning
---
The &lt;**Ella Grace**\&gt; is the foremost (only) **LGBT+ and queer-friendly** guild on H-Sulfuras!  We are a welcoming place to give you a break from the casual bigotry and targeted toxicity of World of Warcraft and the internet in general.  We welcome allies of all stripes (the LGBT+ ally kind, not the Alliance kind).  There is no room for sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, or bigotry of any kind in this guild.
---
Named after a pleasant cocktail bar down the street from the founding members, the Ella Grace is a place to set aside your troubles for a moment and just exist peacefully with yourself and others.  We know better than most how the world can appear inclusive, tolerant, and accepting, until the anonymity of the internet allows people's true colors to come out.
---
Every time we advertise the guild, we're pelted with "innocent" questions like "Why do you have to point out that you're gay?  Aren't you just making yourself a target?  My guild is inclusive and we don't have to mention that crap."; less "innocent" questions like "Why are you making a guild about sex?"; and outright hostile questions like "take that queer shit back to California" and "fuck that gay shit."  Those questions are indicative of exactly why this guild needs to exist.
---
**Rules**
---
* We don't tolerate any form of hatred in our guild chat or in our members.
---
* We do not engage others with hostility or name-calling, no matter how much they try to hurt us.  We argue with love, logic, and reason.
---
* We do not mention anything explicitly sexual.
---
* Have fun, enjoy camaraderie, and relax.
---
That's it!
---
We are mostly social- and leveling-focused, but many of our members love running dungeons as a team, and some have an interest in PvP when battlegrounds come around.  Drop us a line if you spot one of us in-game, or send a mail to Stonetail-Sulfuras.  We would love to have you.  (Discord available though seldom used right now.)
---
every single fucking day once
---
You dumbass, there's WAY more people per server than there was originally. Maybe that's why you don't understand the people blaming blizzard.
---
Hmm. I'll have to check it out when I get around to getting my mage alt off of level 1. :)
---
Lol nope
---
You have to resolve names, and no paying customer is above the other, so you can't have customer 1 keep the name customer 2 had on his old realm. They've also been stubborn to introduce a second/family name, so I highly doubt they'll ever do merges. There's multiple realms that are absolutely dead on retail, even with crz.
---
One of my few good decisions was rolling a PVE server at launch. Having played PVP exclusively for vanilla and taking note of the change of gamer culture in the last 10 years I somehow saw this coming.  Rolling around on a PVE server flagged for PVP is much closer to the vanilla PVP server flavor than classic PVP servers are.
---
hmm, even so it might still be pretty good cus its an extra +6 dmg mitigated when it procs cus sanc is 19 and the trinket is 25
---
Flight point camping flex. Love it.
---
&gt;being known as a Grand Marshall/High Warlord is actually prestigious
---
it's really not.
---
I feel like that may have been the case in vanilla, but in classic there actually seems to be a stigma from the general population, no doubt because of the time commitment and how it's 100% a time commitment over a skill indicator like an arena title for example.
---
Maybe deep down they respect the rank, but the general consensus around even the current highest rankers is "wow what a no life". It seems like if you're not a streamer getting paid to play wow for 12 hours a day, you're seen as a neckbeard basement dweller if you have the time/means of pushing for the top ranks.
---
The weapons and title are definitely iconic though, and you certainly would be known on the server, it's just the glory/respect aspect that I don't think are going to really be there.
---
Sounds like you want WoW to be pay to win. Fuck that
---
Yes, Naxx won't be out for a while. You are estimating ~24 hours of playtime per week, even starting from a fresh character you should be able to hit 60 in 5-6 weeks with that play time. BWL is slated for early 2020, you should easily hit 60 around its release.
---
I will attempt to kill every single red name I possibly can no matter what you're doing. And I will absolutely fish from your pool if I kill you.
---
you shouldnt assume anyone is playing on any server
---
I’m sure I’ll get downvoted but layering worked well for a reason, we have the same sized game world but now the caps are 3-4x higher on how many players can be on one server than we used to. Sure my potato back then could barely handle IF, but now the issue is less about pc specs and more about too many cramped in the same sized spaces
---
I don't understand people who say things like this. It's like you're seeking validation or something? You are still lurking on the subreddit of a game you rage quit. Are you a masochist?
---
Stopped watching 2 secs in. That stream interface gave me cancer.
---
You forgot to say, I camp flight points for 10 hours a day, FTFY.
---
Alliance good
---
It's not ally dominated, census says 54-46 horde (dno about it since flamelash transfers, but it might be slightly in favor of alliance), and its most definitely not the same as a PVE server.  Theres tonnes of pvp everywhere, both sides camp flightpaths. The sides takes turns at controlling all the high level zones - you can't walk inside everlook or gadgetztan if the other faction controls it. You get destroyed when you land in LHC if you don't control EPL
---
I think "i've killed when I see them doing it" is different than purposely doing nothing else besides killing it, waiting for the next person to start, killing it, repeat
---
horde bad
---
game design good
---
Cursor will cast where your mouse is regardless of what is under it, mouseover will only cast if the mouse is over a frame or over something in the world
---
It was crazy busy in IF yesterday on Earthshaker!
---
We won't know until next week unless it was announced somewhere and I've missed it.
---
I looked at that website that shows faction balance at 60. Which was 47% alliance and 53% horde. Every zone is warzone. Depends on the day who owns the area
---
You could prioritize people/targets and it auto targeted them. worked in PVE as well. People didn't mouseover decurses or dispels in vanilla. They pressed a button. The strength of Paladins is cleanse. 2 paladins spamming decursive and a melee train with prio 1 on the other healer was strong. They still lost pug vs pug with it though.
---
One of the biggest changes is server population size.
---
Player density is much higher, it wasn't so terrible when there was a third as many people out there, the frequency of pvp was much lower in vanilla than classic. Maybe there was one other dude farming timbermaw, now theres 3 or 4. Even the suboptimal farming locations are camped.
---
Ironically "no changes" on this front probably would've resulted in less pvp encounters and less feeling of being camped. As it is now you really need to elbow out room.
---
also stockades is a bad place to test things imo, cus the mobbs have a debuff that increases damage taken by 5. You can cleanse it but they apply it pretty often and they can apply multiple of it
---
Benediction folk! Water and Food same deal! I’ll stand outside of SW bank ringing a bell like the Salvation Army people!
---
Yeah, you're right. Last night, though... whew boy, last night was a clusterfuck. When I logged on one of my friends sarcastically said that getting into Blackrock Depths should be easy because "there's only Alliance from Kargath to the dungeon's entrance," and he wasn't wrong about that. I must have died 20 times going from Kargath to BRD because Alliance had almost perfectly spaced themselves out to ensure that they were able to gank people who were rezzing. 
---
It was quite the sight. For a server that is supposed to be Horde dominated, the Alliance have done a very good job of organizing and not making it easy for Horde players who travel alone or in small groups.
---
Private servers don't usually have that level of high pop and in addition most pservers make lotus pop to keep the gold farmers at bay.
---
Ok what do I do as a priest with one useless fear and one trinket
---
Too late now 🙁
---
Unfortunately for some classes and specs, the epic gear set is the best one for pvp. Quick example that comes to mind is feral druids.
---
Of course that is just Rank 13, which even then is an ordeal. Honestly i’m not sure i cba with the pvp system, and pvp is my thing in MMOs.
---
Sounds to me like he's being camped then.
---
This + faction change or server transfer to ally dominated server.
---
What I don't think you understand is that I literally died 17 times to go from LH to Strat UD. It's not uncommon for me to die 10+ times every time I want to go to a dungeon, there is a guild constantly camping Strat's gate, there are rogues in the bridges of TB, there are groups in all the zeps I've used, there are groups in the boats I've used. They're everywhere.
---
It happens with both sides, one of them is larger. For a solo player I read this threads and think my experience is very much the same.
---
Got my Shaman to 52 and unsubbed.
---
TIL darnassus
---
Alliance has better raid racials. Also pallys are better for raids I believe.
---
You're getting offended over a joke on the internet. You lost.
---
The fuck? Crabwarrior how? Because rogues popping evasion isn't a problem?
---
I personally would drop mining. That depends on the prices on your server though. Currently on my server a stack of thorium is barely worth 3 gold so you're effectively mining for crystals/sapphires otherwise you're not really making money, and I don't really see that changing anytime soon.
---
Herbing on the other hand will always have a use because you're always going to have people who need flasks/pots/elixirs for raiding.
---
Lmao 5 is low
---
You won't have a problem, just be a bit mindful of body pulling if your group is skipping trash.
---
 Probably the reason you can't get into groups is there's also a bunch of 60 healers looking to run dungeons? In that case, try to do guild runs or form your own group.
---
A group of 5+ horde killing the same guy over and over... Dividing 200 honor among them from the first kill.
---
I dont think most people realize how hard R14 is.
---
Keep ploddiing on bud. It sucks but I got some happiness from helping others get HoJ.. others get nature damage bracers from incendious etc.. you'll get it mate
---
Can we see some pics of a raid? Or a vid?
---
We said all this would happen on the forums. Blizzard had Nostalrius staff  in who told them all this and their private server experiences.
---

Taking a picture of your screen with your phone is almost as dumb as not knowing what alt+f4 does in 2019.  In the context of this post, it's hilarious that OP is this computer illiterate.  The irony is thick, and should be pointed out.

Enjoy your day!
---
Worth nothing that far from every warrior Will be running around with thunderfury. Also how many Great tanking 1h axes are there?
---
On the other hand, the 25% ekstra stunn ressist is massive. So many damn mobs have stunns in classic.
---
I thought phase 3, which included BWL, was supposed to drop in a few days... Am I mistaken?

Facts sometimes i get into BRM with 0 deaths next day 10-12 deaths

That is honestly how we started! I was not the original GM and joined because of two people named Quesarito and BigChalupa and their lovely recruiting messages.  
---
Turns out enough people did the same and we all vibed really well and wanted to make it a decently serious guild. So here we are downing Rag and having a blast every week with numerous Taco Bell memes and references :D

If you or anyone else is interested in joining feel free to HMU in game (Isuckatheals) or on here! Will be glad to provide more information on request!
---
this man does not wear leather
---
joke aside, i felt like there might actually be 6 or fewer guys in the classic department
---
I stopped doing that 300 runs ago, now I am bribing a healer to do 2 man runs.
---
That's the issue, 3 hours a week isn't a lot of time but you have to show up on a specific day, at a specific time, for 3 hours straight with no interruptions.  I don't play classic bc it's impossible for me to make that kind of commitment. 
---
A casual player might play 30 minutes before and after work and put in the same time over the weej but make no progress. This is not necessarily bad but it's just the way classic wow is structured.
---
Salty rogues lolol. Its not retail daggers are good on warr
---
You're misunderstanding. He's saying that PvP being unbalanced isn't necessarily a population issue.
---
&gt; damn that's some expensive trash.
---
Thats literally what all merchandise is
---
Maybe look up straw man before throwing around the scenario. I threw in the numbers to give something concrete to work with for ease of understanding. 
---
If you can’t see how having a class who can ONLY use one of two upgrades having PRIORITY over the class that has two upgrades available then I don’t know what to say since it seems like a pretty clear concept to me.
---
True. I was stuck in a TBC mindset where Insect Swarm was castable in Moonkin form. I guess it's only relevant for healers then.
---
I'll probably complain but right now it's fun lol
---
I’m Horde on Horde dominated server (60% to 40% ratio) and allies would camp in other areas besides BRM. Mostly DM or the bridge to Feralas. Everyone is an asshole when it’s to their advantage. I do agree that vanilla was great because it was new and people would find things to do such as duels and guildie fun stuff. 
---
Hopefully they will cross realm the BGs. Screw #nochange. Modern problems requires Modern Solution!

man i just hit like 46 the other day - cant imagine rerolling for that now haha

I think every gnome who’s ever beaten me has spit on me. Must be some sort of height complex.

Dampfschmied der Dunkeleinsenzwerge... what the actual :O
---
PvP Happened.  Oh no!
---
I never said they were bad. They just aren't a *good* choice because you only excel at defending/ninjaing objectives (hence your role in premades). Outside of stealth you're exposed without TBC cooldowns and there are less small scale fights compared to WPvP.
---
Regarding warriors, I mostly meant their ability in solo PvP.
---
I am this way. 35 years old, recently played Rise of the Tomb Raider. I freaking love Tomb Raider but the metroidvania aspects almost made me rage quit. I have a huge backlog, not enough hours in the week, and I ain't got time for BS artificial padding in a game.
---
Reflective grass and rocks are soooooo amazing /s
---
If you go in with largely empty bags you still get all the gold at the end from items etc?
---
But they are claiming flamelash is dead due to imbalance. Any server they hijack will be dead on arrival due to imbalance.
---
You wanted to come shit on an otherwise positive post. Sounds like whining to me.
---
Imo they are top of the world /swoon
---
The fact is, I think there are tweaks that could be made without damaging the integrity of the game, before just opening up server transfers, but the #nochanges crowd would still flip.
---
1. Decrease the cooldown time on Molten Core and Onyxia runs by a day. I think a huge part of the problem here is that you have so many people with nothing else to do. BGs aren't necessarily going to alleviate the problem if there are long queues, you'll still have people who will find it more efficient to farm honor on the boats, lower level groups heading to BRD, and camping FPs, if they can't farm it efficiently in BGs. Once BWL comes out, if that is available, plus being able to do MC more often, you might find that the PvP numbers would become more manageable.
---
2. Change the Honorless Target Mechanic to give the target a bit more of a fighting chance. These changes would be, increasing the time to 45 seconds off of an FP or Login, and having a recently resurrected person have Honorless Target in World, but not in BGs.
---
3. Eliminate the PvP Flagging cooldown time in Friendly Territory, or cut it dramatically from 5 minutes to a maximum of 1m, as well as having anyone logging into the game inside friendly territory come in automatically unflagged. This would reduce the incentive for rogues to hide inside cities all day.
---
3. Put guards on the boats from Menethil and in the Deeprun Tram, and on the docks. At the very least at the same level as the ones on Zeppelins for the Horde side. (Horde, think of it this way - all of those irritating Gnome Mages will have a reduced income by not selling as many portals between IF and Darnassus).
---
4. To Offset the loss of WPvP honor from those changes, increase the amount of times you gain honor off the same person from 10 kills to 20 kills, with each kill reducing 5% honor. If the other changes would encourage less dramatically unfair fights, then this would be the concession to give for fairer fights.
---
Of course, this is only my opinion, and I'm sure many will disagree and will tell me exactly why I am wrong.
---
I support changes... At the least the fucking obvious ones.  The pvp shit was obvious even 15 years ago.  There's a reason Blizzard later updated honor system with DK and diminishing returns on honor from kills.  Later on, retail showed how bad wpvp can get yet again.
---
Why they're letting phase 2 ruin wow classic is beyond me.  On my server, it's a ghost town on the alliance side.  We can't get any ubrs or even zf groups going consistently.  Horde repeatedly ganks even people who don't give honor.  The economy is crashing because of the lack of people.
---
My friends and I ironically went from playing up to 8+ hours a day to just playing battlegrounds in hearthstone.
---
Yeah I double checked and read the top end damage for demonshear way wrong. It's definitely better.
---
Well, it will definitely be more similar to P1 once BGs come out. A lot of people just don't understand this.
---
Those guys camping FPs or BRM aren't doing it to be griefing dicks, they're just doing what they have to to compete.
---
Once BGs come out the bar for gaining honor will be so much higher that sitting there at FPs all day wouldn't even replenish your decay. They won't be there, and they won't stray far from Orgrimmar either because they have to requeue when their BG is done. They will just sit at battlemaster/outside of org dueling all day just like vanilla.
---
It's almost over.
---
I got to the 900 average mana per minute, *0,3 to find 135 extra mana per minute is.. oh 27 mp/5. Derp. It did seem way too high, thanks for correcting me!
---
Dominant factions on PvP servers act the same.
---
Horde are the dominant faction on all PvP servers except...1.
---
You have a fair point, but I'd like to ask. Can you really blame the "no changes" group? Because they didn't really get no changes. With the increased server pop and all. Increased populations just make you more likely to run into a 60 because there isn't an increase in places to level.
---
So really they did change something. If we had higher populations back in the original release, maybe they would have increased guard strength to account for frequent raids through a town.
---
Respect lol
---
&gt; Not releasing BGs at the same time is absolutely something Blizzard fucked up, I do agree with that.
---
Not really, the community YELLED no changes, this is closer to progressive no changes than BGs at honor launch will ever be. Yes there are changes, but a big part of the community, probably the majority, wanted this.
---
This post literally makes 0 sense.
---
Thank you for the funny picture OP. Not sure why the moderators hate funny good pictures, but they and anyone who agrees with them is obviously wrong.
---
It is for pvp, as shown in the video.
---
Anyone know the gear that the bankers have? Would be fun to do this on an RP server.
---
You misspelled blood fury. I'll forgive you... this time.
---
A true PvP legend in the making I see
---
I think you need to call in your whole guild before you can talk shit on this 70-30 pvp server dude.
---
I can confirm that leaving the raid will 100% result in you being removed from the BG. If memory serves me correctly, it functions in the same way as instances. If you don't re-join the group/raid you get a countdown that triggers you being ejected.
---
From my experience, most people going for rank 14 are pretty good at pvp.
---
Yes. On Alliance you get "don't tell me how to play the game" and apathy. Also on Horde you don't have to train players because they train themselves. I'm not a babysitter and anyone that can't so simple research with today's internet and 1000 videos to help them doesn't really want to improve themselves. **People that aren't asking questions or that aren't dueling outside of town don't want to get better.**
---
As far as "leading" I led some Tarren Mill crap before the server got bored of mages pressing rank 1 blizzard and horrible server lag due to servers that are somehow worse than private servers were.
---
My guild, mutiny, came here during first wave of xfers when it was like 80/20 ally dominated. We fought through the struggle lol
---
Look, shamans are a great class. You don't have to reroll. Just don't try to tank. The current state of tanks is as follows:
---
Warriors: Can tank 100% of the content well. The go-to tank.
---
Druids: Can tank 90% of the content well. A few fights they can't tank, but there are also a few fights where they're better than warriors.
---
Paladins: Meme-tanks. Can do alright in dungeons if played well and geared appropriately, and have some limited utility in aoe pulls due to snap aoe threat, but this is not worth bringing a prot paladin for.
---
Shaman: Does not come up in the discussion. Laughable, at best, but more often pitiable or despised. Has some minor utility as a dungeon tank during the leveling process, often due to lack of other options.
---
You can fiercely disagree with me if you want. Go ahead and try and prove me wrong. But in the end, you will just make yourself miserable. Because no matter how good of a player you are, there are some class limitations you cannot overcome, and bashing yourself against them repeatedly will war you down and kill your enjoyment of the game.
---
Do yourself a favor, and just enjoy enhancement dps, if a guild will accept that. Sadly, that's also a meme dps spec, but at least you bring improved Windfury totem, among your other totems, and that can make up for your mediocre dps in how much you buff the rest of your group. And be glad you can do this! Ret paladins, sadly, cannot say the same thing, as all of their utility can be provided by a holy paladin.
---
It says phase 6 in wowhead when you look in the items database. At the same time, the warrior dps bis list mentions the plate legs in the phase 3 bis list.
---
Even simpler, just look at the size of the world in wow and think how the fuck was that possible in 2004
---
Suck on that you filthy casual
---
DB + CHT + ACLG beats flurry ace by a significant margin. In fact it beats every sibgle combination of weapons in this phase.
---
Was going to mention this but glad to see you did.  Just going to piggy back. 
---
One person's preset will rarely ever look the same on a different monitor.
---
You don't know if the person who made it was using a calibrated monitor or even some off brand discount thing.  Maybe they had their OLED monitor brightness all the way up and your IPS monitor is all the way down. Anything
---
depends on how blizzard will implement it
---
its a trash spec that slows you down, no point in talking about a prot warrior dps rotation, it doesnt optimally exist.
---
You just throw on a 2h and do more, and also go to the respec guy and go arms. Tank as arms until 60
---
It's super easy if you're fine with banning random people who use AHK or any other type of accessibility scripts. (Well, not once people figure out what you look for and avoid that, but until then it is.)
---
But if you don't want to do that, you're going to have a hard time distinguishing legitimate synthesized input and bots.
---
16 is 8+ tho...
---
Ya but what about the giant elephant in the room called faction imbalance? Servers are already beginning to die.
---
&gt; blizzard is intentionally killing classic.
---
Yes, Blizzard simultaneously likes money and dislikes money.
---
Not if you get aged core leather gloves.
---
Game filter doesn’t work for me, it says I need to restart the game.
---
CHT is bis you noob.
---
Exalted in BGs? Lol, you really did play on private servers. Yeah, all 3 people on each server are gonna be so into WPVP when they reach exalted. I guess we'll also have a shitload of rank 14s running around in no time. Did you even play vanilla? Like the actual game, not the private servers?
---
For The Horde
---
Yes, faction queues apparently. So that paying customers cannot jion the game while others join instantly. That's the great solution
---
&gt;it's all about efficiency now.
---
Cannot disagree more or harder. Retail WoW is about efficiency. Classic is an alternative to that. If you're coming to classic to play "efficiently" I have to wonder...why? Classic is not an efficient world, it's not an efficient game.
---
No its not stop making up bullshit.
---
That's a good mindset to have. Another one I try to do (not always successful) is to try and help my guildmates go after their BiS. A lot of times, they'll reciprocate the favor. The problem I'm running into is that I've gotten almost all my healers and caster dps their BiS items, and I'm still coming up short, due to that rng you and I seem to suffer from. That, and melee dps just have a few drops that are quite rare...
---
*Shakes fist at 4% drop rate on Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge*
---
People that enjoy and strive to be on a heavily dominated faction are a joke lol
---
Yea I don’t go through kargath pass anymore. I’ve been flying over to flame crest and running from there. Usually a little less drama there. 
---
We tried to make a noble charge out of MC to clear it and get the rest of our guys in. Only to be flattered by multiple raids on Tuesday. 
---
And yea to your point the alliance has held their own well on Herod. Contrary to many of the comments here I have had plenty of deaths at the hands of the ally’s in felwood especially.
---
Cht is bis
---
Is there no buff that actually shows up on the pally?
---
Silithus by AQ.  Almost nobody goes there.
---
Inside the mazorthil cave in winterspring.
---
How important or "real" things are everyone determines for themselves. WoW is a popular work of art created by real people for real people, and it's also social. So if someone wants to become High Warlord or Grand Marshal in the game, it's their freedom of choice and there's no universal judge to tell this kind of time spending is inferior to anything else.
---
they will be done grinding and everyone interested in getting good gear will be in silithus because melees get a sick trinket and casters get BIS endgame bracers. And that shit show grind doesnt even include the boss drops which are not really important yet pretty decend aswell.
---
Uh oh, I better bind my water and food so the internet people don’t get upset
---
I'll take one in earthfury, please!
---
Damn. I wish I could afford a PC. I think life would be good again if I were able to roam these hills just one more time.
---
Isn't Saurfang a High Overlord?
---
I knew it would be bad, but not THIS bad. Holy hell, i've never been griefed so hard in my entire video game careeer.   
---
Thank god BF5 has now some content to boot, because this community has made me completely disinterested in playing wow classic any longer. It's just not worth it. I cannot walk in any of the farm zones without getting ganked to hell by a rogue or a warrior. Being a holy priest is literal hell.
---
I do think the #nochanges people are simply an incredibly vocal minority.  The majority of sane people are ok with things that make sense even if they are not #nochanges.
---
That's the least interresting things to do in the game. You can't say "well I'm a 100% silithus dust player, my guild revolves around this".
---
While the game isn’t perfect. The game needs time to sort itself out to the “classic” experience everyone wants. People aren’t going to be farming in the world like they are when zg aq drops. Or the amount of farming that will happen will be negligible. The biggest issue are the choke points right now. Molten core is the only raid and the next one coming bwl is in the same spot. That’s also where a lot of people leveling 52-60 need to go to go grab gear. So it makes sense to mindlessly farm there. When bgs come out, the people who want to be most efficient will leave. The people killing 2 birds with 1 stone might be there. And you will go back to having random parties killing people or the occasional rogues ganking you on your way in in which case you should be mostly ok with a group. It’s not as bad as everyone makes it out to be because only people who can see right now are the ones complaining. I am currently 58 and have played since release just haven’t had time. My buddies are some of the most geared on the server. Our experience is wildly different because of the time that we can all play. But, I frame it the right way and I know getting to 60 when bgs drop has always been my goal. I’ll gear up at my own speed and don’t have to be cutting edge each content release. I can catch up during phase 3 and such.
---
Just like they pulled Dire Maul out of Phase 2 and released it early, they're doing the same thing with AV/WSG and releasing it the week of Dec 10.  They indicated that the rest of Phase 3 would be released in 'early 2020'.
---
That's wrong. They are releasing the battlegrounds, which was originally planned to be in phase 3, early on december 10th. Phase 3 (with BWL) is still for early 2020.
---
Dont listen to any idiots on reddit. You need aged core  leather gloves, but DB+CHT is BiS.
---
Phase 3 isn't actually in a couple of days, they're just releasing BGs early since wold pvp is ass. BWL is being estimated by most people to be I think around February-ish.
---
I live on a more balanced server benediction. The last time I checked it was 60-40 A-H. There are a bunch of really really geared alliance groups that “pvp”. And by that I mean they ram 50 people into groups of 10. But they’ll always get less honour than the smaller group. Even if we have to reset run away then come back. 
---
Now on running to instances. Especially the past two weeks where the horde seemingly don’t find it as fun or for what ever reason the horde controlled areas are now all alliance areas. And I still have had 0 issue running anywhere. Sure one of my characters Is a rogue. So I can stealth past half the time. My other char is a mage and there’s 5 hunters and 5 mages sitting in tanaris every day camping anyone who dares come there. Yet I’ll just mount up take a route that they think is weird and I’ll not get touched on my way to farm ZF.  Or SM watching 3 60s get killed by 30 level 30-40s. 
---
Raid nights are even more fun, because we will have teams crash into our guild and get wiped as we all run to MC or onyxia. Last night as example in onyxia a guild jumped in on us and I got 39 HKs they killed 4 of us.  10 of our people were sitting inside the dungeon already. 
---
So I’m sorry to say this. But I honestly think a lot of people complaining either don’t remember the gorilla warfare that was vanilla.  And this hasn’t really changed. It’s a two way street on a lot of servers and of course it’s jarring now that after 2 months of basically mild pvp it’s a grind. But it’s not that much different. It’s just that horde have a lot more players now.   
---
On top of that. You sorta assume that people will have so much better gear because of pvp grinding they are doing and it will ruin WSG/AV. But it’ll be the MC geared groups running the show. As there can only be a certain amount of people with the gear by the time the BGs drop. And who’s going to win? My rogue with t2 helm and pants, full hit cap, 27% crit, viskag and brutality. Or some dude who got his blue gear? Or the one person who got rank 14 to get his weapons?  
---
Fuck when I didn’t have viskag I still bested the rogues with perdition and core tooth. My mage yesterday 3 shot crit a rogue who had as much gear as my main. 
---
Get over it. You’re as bad as the people who complained about any changes and everything else. We picked pvp servers for this fact. Because the plans in which are being enacted were demonstrated in private servers already and we knew what it was going to be. 
---
The only people who I could accept complaining is a guy who got into the game no past experiences and didn’t watch anyone of the hype videos on the subjects. But even them this is all they know. So they would think that this is the game. And it is. This is what it was. Fuck trying to get into MGT took me a good 40 mins as a BT geared healing priest, by a guy named corpsegrinder. 
---
But this is the tendency of people that they either have a short term memory, they can’t think outside the box, or refuse to try and help themselves.  If the rolls were reversed it’s probably be you in the camping group. I bet anyone who complains when they have a full group running into 5-10 people of the other faction I bet they are destroying them and then forgetting that this is exactly what they are complaining about. 
---
Get over it Move to a pve server and for the love of god. Do not for a second think of “punishing” people for playing the game how they want just because it’s messing with the way you want to play. It’s the same game and the same rules for everyone, and on pvp servers it’s always been part of the game to fuck with the other side as much as possible.
---
Shadowburn seems to fall in the high priority slot. It will push off any other warlock dots, except CoS and CoE. I would highly recommend not using it on bosses unless it is about to die.
---
Bring 2 apps and pop 1 on the last trash pull before Shaz. Stay in the entire time
---
Look, if a rogue gets into a 1v1 with a warrior, they lost already. Warriors have all the tools to hard counter rogue. So what if they pop evasion? 2 Overpowers and they're dead. Piercing howl to snare or intimidating shout into an intercept. Boom, cooldown for Overpower is refreshed.
---
That's layering where you don't see part of the community.
---
&gt;Alliance on Gehennas
---
Man we on Horde have it just as bad. Apes and other dickwads ganking all day long. Its not just Alliance who suffers
---
Does anyone know how bgs will be for xp? My friends and I were talking about it and one of the things we remember from over the years is bgs only giving xp for wins.
---
I'm in that last stretch of leveling at 55 and I'm wondering if it would be an alternative to dungeon spam or just supplementary.
---
One can speculate but i'd say a chunk will be satisfied after getting av rep to exalted.
---
Keep crying
---
But who actually cares?
---
I barely care who gets gear in my own raid. Why the fuck would I care about some random guild on a different faction and different server?
---
People can give gear out however they want to. Loot council means you don’t have to give shit players loot. Raiders agree to it. So what’s the problem?
---
Blaming the #nochanges crowd is ridiculous. #Nochanges exists because we can't trust Blizzard to not fuck up the game. Everyone knew there would be problems for phase 2 wpvp due in part to player population on realms. The current state of overpopulation on realms can be directly blamed on Blizzard, not the #nochanges crowd.
---
You just ruined this mans whole career
---
Ironically, a lot of the #NoChanges crowd were clamouring for a Nostalrius style experience of ten or twelve thousand people crammed into a single server, not actual vanilla.
---
I’ll ding 51 tonight, 9 days played on a warrior not bad.
---
I'm hearing O Fortuna personally.
---
Where did i state that Warrior need to continue stacking hit rating after reaching 9%?
---
All i said is that Rogue can pretty much reach those numbers through talents alone, let alone have a functional tier 1 set, which does provide some hit even.
---
Besides that, there’s not that much leather a Warrior wants to take over a Rogue in MC either.
---
You have the wrists that gives alot of strength, which in actually subpar to the tier 1 wrists for Rogues anyway.
---
And even then the Mail wrists are better anyway.
---
Then we have the +5 dagger gloves, which in reality (from a weapon skill perspective) is lackluster to Rogues due to talents, and the diminishing return, and is pretty much best for Fury tanks anyway (and then it can be argued that edgemasters is better).
---
As gear progresses you can become more picky later.
---
Besides, since DM released you can easily get ahold of two rings with hit pretty fast.
---
But for a new, or relatively new Warrior, truestrike (just an example) is amazing, most warriors (including me) reaches lvl 60 with Big Bad Pauldrons, and to have an easy farmable boss that gives shoulders with 2% hit is a huge upgrade, and should be the second farm a new Warrior does (first should be mask, which should be a placeholder until you can get Lionheart).
---
But UBRS has alot of good pre-raid bis, that will stick with you for awhile (Truestrike, battleborn, weapons) plus the waist should you do a full run.
---
So this is just a discussion that will most likely go nowhere.
---
I never stated that you oughta stack hit rating to an extreme extent, only that hit gear is more sought after, and more important for warriors in the beginning.
---
Warriors and Rogues does not share that much in MC, maybe an item or two.
---
Besides, 9% hit rating is enough, just so you can’t miss yellow hits.
---
But hitting 10-11% is not a death sentence.
---
While crit does become more important when you reach 9% hit (or 6% as human, which i am), i still rock 10% hit, and still rock the optimal gear i am currently wearing.
---
And no, i don’t use Truestrike.
---
So you pretty much called me out on an argument i never made.
---
Yeah not sure why the video is so long, but it wasn’t that confusing if you just watch to the end lol. The map wasn’t open when the Paladin one-shot him.
---
Three hours a week is not a lot. Three hours all at once in one evening can be a lot.
---
A sure I came in here with a pretty positive attitude until Op started to spew git gud BS and then deflecting a valid argument on why he is not starting on the server slightly skewed to alliance
---
They haven't doomed anyone, the others had the same option and if they chose not to take it, how is it the fault of the people who did ?
---
Wowhead doesn't have extra insider information, until we see it on the rep vendor it isn't confirmed. Same with the blue PvP gear situation from a few weeks ago.
---
Tell that to my group member when’s I get told to unlock a chest and share everything inside. 
---
Lockpicking is free but my time leveling it wasn’t. Why don’t I get all the loot?
---
No, they really don't. Blizzard is just trash at bit detection. They have all the data they need, click times, key inputs, time between inputs, etc. If they wanted to make a system that could detect inhuman input, they could. 
---
Again, RuneScape did this exact thing. It's slightly different there as the entire game revolves around clicking however making human-like movements with a mouse and having correct input delay is very difficult. Blizzard is just lazy as fuck.
---
Would be hilarious if horde followed you over to the other server.
---
The current strategy is just to have melee pop arcane pots and zerg it. It works quite well if your dps is half decent.
---
You realize that agreement with a point is not necessary for it to be valid?
---
?? How is it a waste of time? That’s why I rolled a rogue.
---
Welcome to vanilla wow, if you don't like it don't let the door hit you on the way out. For every forum cry baby there are 10 people enjoying the game as it is.
---
The current situation is a result of a series of poor choices made by blizzard that compounded on each other.
---
* vastly underestimating the amount of realms needed which would end up necessitating free server transfers to fresh realms after a very short amount of time
---
* upon allowing these server transfers,  not limiting them to the dominant faction once the server reached a breakpoint of imbalance.  They implemented such a transfer restriction with the most recent wave of transfers quite easily which proves that it wasnt any sort of technical limitation,  just complete incompetence and/or apathy that they allowed the non-dominant faction to transfer away from imbalanced servers during the first two transfer windows
---
* After draining most servers of the non-dominant faction,   launching the honor system without at least one battleground alongside it.  This ensures that the outnumbered faction would be hopelessly farmed for honor which is where we are at now.
---
FWIW,  i played on the non-dominant faction on the two pservers prior to classic.  I was ally on Lightbringer(40:60 A:H) and Horde on Northdale(65:35 A:H).  In both cases the game was nowhere near as unplayable as it is now simply because they launched BGs with the honor system.  The only reason faction imbalance is such a big issue is due to the fact that rankers are forced to farm their honor in the open world.  Launching BGs and honor together was such an obvious move to anyone who had the smallest modicum of familiarity with the game that it boggles my mind why blizzard wouldn't do such a thing.  The only two things that makes sense to me is that they are intentionally trying to drive the more casual playerbase back to retail,  or that they are so grossly incompetent and/or apathetic towards all facets of running a game properly that they make Bethesda look like geniuses.
---
It's definitely a greedy upgrade path and not one many will achieve. 
---
But its BiS. 
---
It doesnt matter whether you assume wbuffs or not.
---
Like flameguards are a couple more AP in value than aclg and you get to wear CHT offhand.
---
Its a no brainer.
---
Dude... I'm not taking literally ALL the plate, just what I would use, even if not necessarily right then.  I can't quest as a healer, so if some nice "of the Bear" bracers drop that are a few levels higher than what I've got, I'm gonna snag them.
---
If that lands me on your blacklist... well, good then, I guess.  I don't mind people taking gear for offspec and I don't feel like they need to ask permission on each and every roll or link what they currently have, so that's just how I roll and encourage others to do so as well.
---
But you see the game many times.  
---
Doesn't it kill it's "freshness"?
---
&gt; With separate servers your community is always visible and consistent, only time it would drastically change was when servers are merged (like in vanilla).
---
And in vanilla, server mergers were absolutely a failure. I don't know why we would use the option we know sucks hard. Having two servers means two communites, two economies, two progressions, merging that means a clusterfuck within the community which is the strongest part of Classic. It was bad then and I can't see how it would be better now.
---
&gt; This solution would also have meant only the intended number of rares and drops per server.
---
Until they got merged, suddenly you are flooded with these items and economies crash.
---
No stalker, there is no way.
---
Guuurl
---
Yeah when i played vanilla originally I was an altoholic, took forever to get max level, and then really never raided.  Now I'm 35, power leveled to 60 the most efficient way possible, have 1 toon, raid every tuesday.  It's just more regimented value added time for me.  Maybe we're just more focused as old farts haha
---
I mean, any reward system is going to reward time and effort...
---
Amen
---
Some of those people that's their enjoyment. 
---
For example, one of the people who jumped me as I came off a flight path this weekend, was the same person who I stomped on multiple occasions weeks apart whose soul enjoyment in the game is apparently camping Splintertree post in Ashenvale. 
---
A person spending weeks camping people half their level isn't worried about wasting peoples time, in fact that seems to be their sole goal/enjoyment in life.

Wow, you're not wrong. Also all of the comments about how "it's not technically gold selling!!!" Their neurons are pulling Simone Biles-level mental gymnastics.

Dude lasher farm is insane money. I made 500g doing it all day yesterday and didn't have any special drops to inflate that gold value.
---
Why are you gatekeeping enjoyment of the game?
---
1. Lock character creation for vastly overpopulated faction
---
2. Create free transfers from overpopulated faction to other less populated servers or servers with a deficient of their faction. 
---
3. Reduce max server size back to classic launch size. preferably smaller (this will create queues in the small term on the biggest servers)
---
4. Make faction specific queues for servers with queues.
---
5. Fix Everlook/Gadgetzan guards for real this time. 
---
And allow people to move from PVP to PVE-servers and vice versa. If you don't really wanna fix the imbalance then just implement paid character transfer.
---
The whole “people spent their time talking back then” is such nostalgia glasses fantasy. I’ve been MMOing non stop since EQ in 99. Yes we socialized in game “more” back then. But only because we didn’t have shit like discord or twitter. It was “content”. It’s just that back then, you needed let’s say 5 DM N runs to get the item you need. It took you two weeks to do that, between finding groups and actually completing the content. Now, you can do those 5 runs in 5 hours. 
---
It comes down to information availability and addons. Noting to do with actual content or socialization bullshit.
---
Currently a 46 Enhancement Shaman. And LOVING it.
---
I do know, however, that enhancement shamans don’t have the most important role in late game raids. Aside from totem twisting and keeping certain debuffs on bosses with certain weapons, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to “find my place” when I get to late game. I’ve been collecting decent gear while I level so if I switch specs now I wouldn’t be terribly geared.
---
When do people normally make the switch over to resto? And is it viable to do an ele/resto build to where I can flex dps or heal when it comes to what a group needs in the moment?
---
Are you playing it now?  
---
So YT didn't make any difference, but twitch did?
---
I think the oldest wow video I have a memory of is a paladin doing this! It some cheesey editing of a bunch of people pointing into deadmines, it was awesome then and still awesome now.
---
The people do this because the game forces them. They need to farm honor for rank 14, there are no battlegrounds, the only way to farm is worldpvp and there is a lot of competition.
---
Lol so serious
---
"Damn bro this guy played 16 hours of WoW every day for the past months. What a man!"
---
I agree wholeheartedly. The so-called "hybrid tax" is important. Otherwise, why roll a pure dps class if a hybrid does the job just as well, but is 1 respect away from doing another pure roll just as well?
---
In my opinion, this balance was perfected in TBC. I played a paladin tank then, and was I the best choice for most bosses? Hell no. But COULD I do it? Yes, with 1 or 2 exceptions (Damn you Archimonde...). What that enabled me to do is by working hard as hell, doing research, and pushing my class to the limit, I was able to surpass many warriors, and thus prove myself a quality player.
---
But now, if I tried to do that, there isn't anything I could do to make a Paladin tank even semi-decent in raids. If I gear enough defense and avoidance so I don't get obliterated, my threat will be mediocre, and my mana will be gone super fast. If I gear towards threat enough to compete with a warrior or druid, I'll get hammered by the boss, AND go oom quickly. If I work on the mana issue... You get the picture :P
---
Man?
---
Empirically incorrect. Look at classic runescape - proof that a company can redo a game they "fucked up" and make it amazing. It has it's own dedicated devs and community.
---
Ally refugee. Sulfuras (horde dominated) to Earthfury. Only been on this server for 3 days. I’ve managed to do more leveling in 12 hrs time played then in 37 hrs played in my last server. I haven’t done raids yet but my runs into brd are usually harassment free. Morgan’s isn’t constantly camped.
---
At work right now, should be in the classic announcement from 2018 blizzcon. Might be able to find it on Wowhead. I'll check when I get home if you don't find it
---
Just dont entertain this delusion that your only missing a small bot of damage. SGC and HoJ are huge upgrades for you.
---
As a pvp refugee on Pagle, I want read this recruitment message.

I haven't watched such videos.

More of Madseason, Barny, PlatinumWoW, Payo, Classic Best Moments and some Asmon videos.

To take pictures of our screens, post them to reddit, and harvest the salt from the easily-offended.
---
I can’t imagine wanting to play a server with bad balancing. Like it just means your training locations will be more crowded if you choose the more popular side, and you’ll get ganked more often if your on the unpopular side
---
Seems like a lose-lose to me.
---
Aye as long as your willing to learn the tanking mechanics behind raiding then all you need is a guild willing to help you out. I can only wish you good luck, since I’m in a similar situation. (My warrior is lvl 50)
---
It’s my second char tho so I’m just focused on learning how to tank first.
---
Id you have so much tome on your hands youre running out of this to do in this game, you probably need to like play two games or make another alt.
---
”Where did I put that WoTF skill again?”
---
faction queues? no.

I don't know if changing buff times is a good idea, it starts to blend all the class/spells into the same homogeneous thing.

referencing my own comment from before I quit that dogshit server.
---
Shaman main here.
---
I would recommend enhancement until around mid level 40, as your perfectly capable of healing as enchantment in basically any dungeon, though it gets frustrating in level 60 dungeons. In regard to setting up camp, I honestly wouldn't. Try to stick to searing totem only, a down ranked heal will be more mana efficient that healing stream tired even with the talent specced. A solid 2H weapon will be your friend for quite a while, try out rockbiter and fw and decide based on your own preference
---
When you get mama spring make sure to drop it anywhere you will be for over 20 seconds, otherwise it's a mana loss overall
---
Additionally try to stick with opening with flame shock followed immediately by your highest rank Earth or frost shock, whichever deals more damage based on your level range, as they will of course rank up at different rates through the leveling process
---
After that stop caring entirely, let your 5 second time kick in and bag away with your 2H 
---
I'll be honest with you shaman leveling is kind of boring
---
I personally specced elemental at 45 as that's when caster great with less comforting starts opening to for you, mostly caster leather that clothies can't use
---
You're going to spend more gold as elemental buying water but it's immensely faster
---
I'm currently running 30/0/21 for raid healing and I still top the healing chart
---
You'll be fine healing any late game content as mostly elemental and still be able to gold farm efficiently
---
I'm sure I forgot something so feel free to ask and I'll be happy to assist
---
Except it doesn't
---
Even if you are killed 4 times by them and worth no honor.
---
Half of it is they want you to play retail and pay for their mounts, pets, toys, etc. (because that would be even more profitable for them). The other half is like a combination of the incompetence of J Allen and his obvious grudge against Classic.
---
lol those fucken zugs
---
Retaining world buffs on you / your raid is like 20x the impact of deathbringer vs axe of deep woods
---
Yeah, on Horde side the most notable guild that left was A Few Good Men and there were other guilds that left as well but I can't recall exactly which ones, but in general the Horde lost a lot of people. 
---
I can't say with certainty why they opened free transfers off Dunemaul, but I vaguely remember the reason being that the actual Dunemaul server was old as shit, as in, old hardware, and was lagging badly during primetime, and this was one of their fixes.
---
&gt; also, show us your math please, since you have it on hand apparently 
---
Here, a small example.
---
Vanilla faction balance : 60-40 (faction doesn't matter). Vanilla median server pop : 2k. Faction split : 1,200 to 800 players. Dominating faction advantage : 400 players. Split to Azeroth 50 zones : 8 players per zone advantage for the dominating faction. Even assuming those 2k players are ALL lvl 60, a 60-40 faction split in Vanilla WAS BALANCED, because the population was much smaller.
---
Classic faction balance : 60-40. Median Classic server pop : 8k (and it was much higher when layering was removed and honor system went live). Faction split : 4,800 to 3,200 players. Dominating faction advantage : 1,600 players. Split to Azeroth 50 zones : 32 players per zone advantage for the dominating faction.
---
Do I have to spill it for you? Vanilla 60-40 split was balanced, Classic 60-40 split is unbalanced. Hell, even 70-30 was more than fine in Vanilla. But in Classic, a 70-30 split is a disaster. And all because the NUMBER of players. The HIGHER the number, the IMBALANCED the ratio, even if it's the fucking SAME as it was in Vanilla.
---
Imagine the subway system in a major city, designed for a number of people. Imagine that overnight, 4 times more people suddenly need to use the subway system.
---
I don't know how else to put it. But Blizzard is fully at fault here, for "estimating" a low Classic population (launching 33 servers and ending up with 4 times more) and for "estimating" a huge drop-off before P2 (90%, but it was 3 times less, around 30%, IF THAT).
---
Lmao. So it's Blizzard's fault nobody used server transfers, even when they were available, because Blizzard wasn't restricting player access to the game, that the playerbase demanded Blizzard makes no changes to. Even though the players who will likely be transferring off the server are not the ones that would be getting hit with faction queue times.
---
Top tier logic. 
---
Nothing will ever satisfy the people who's life revolves around a video game they suck at. There will always be something for you to bitch about. You'll never be happy, and Blizzard has no obligation to make you stop living such a pathetic life.
---
Need your pampers changed?
---
Tell that to my guild. I wish it was Tank prio.
---
&gt; My question is basically if anyone has any ideas on which mobs to grind for money/reagents which will not get me killed every 2 minutes. I'm not asking for any top secret places that will net me 50 gold per hour, just somewhere where I can relax and not worry about getting killed, but still make reasonable amount of gold.
---
Honestly, dungeons are you best bet at the moment.
---
Last night I was trying to grind Satyrs in Azshara, which is usually a pretty quiet zone.  In 1 hour I was ganked 11 times.  So as much as the initial corpse run may be a pain in the ass for you, not consistently dying during the farm runs will make them better gph.
---
Thats the best kind of hate. let it flow.
---
Sure you can deny it. This is 100% Blizzard's fault for doing nothing to balance servers.
---
Ok, that’s encouraging! I’d like to tank (what I did in vanilla) so I know finding a spot will be tough since I’m not geared up yet. But maybe I can find a spot as dps as I get geared then OT or something
---
Hey that's me! I was getting my fortune told when this screenshot was taken :)
---
We didnt listen!
---
Most of those don't work if the population imbalance is across all pvp server.  How do you split a 60/40 horde advantage across all the servers?  These kinds of plans work at getting an individual server to balance, or work if the servers are balanced overall.
---
This is what people keep overlooking, the imbalance is a problem on one or two servers an they need to be shifted around.  The problem is aggregate across all pvp server.  There is no way to have ALL pvp servers in something like a 52/48 split unless you force people to either quit, or reroll alliance.  History has shown people won't reroll and would rather quit.  Not to sure blizzard is super interested in taking the solution that results in people quitting.
---
He popped recklessness
---
Officer Krampfen from the Lovely Lads front and centre.
---
This just in: decently geared warriors using Recklessness + Sweeping Strikes + Whirlwind will do large damage to groups of enemies. More news at 11.
---
There will also just be more types of player around. As a pure raid spec holy priest who only just yesterday got their epic, I've mostly avoided world pvp. I just get murderer instantly, and can't even run away. 
---
But Tuesday? I'll have a whole crew with me and will be in raid spec.
---
Ok cool
---
It is blizzard's fault for not limiting server character creation by faction ratio, not offering faction specific transfers during ques and faction specific ques. 
---
Over all though,  majority of alliance players couldn't care less about pvp.
---
You know scamming is illegal in most places, though, right?
---
They weren't griefing, they were playing the game. How else do you get honour with no BGs?
---
You get groups fairly easy then? My only concern is its a medium pop seemingly so i was worried for end game dungeons and raids i guess.
---
I wish you the best of luck for reaching your classic goals.
---
I guess those allies who really play pvp not going to cry and make posts or Reddit, they have other things to do. It's always different people.
---
&gt;Thats from Dragons Call, no? 
---
Indeed it is!
---
No, seriously, why do we buy phones?
---
Thx, I think you mean internal :-)
---
I'd pay 30 dollars to transfer ally from horde here on Gehennas, server is about 40-60 horde favored
---
They need to allow one last emote after you are instantly killed:
---
"With their dying breath, Gnomedude claps for you, clearly unimpressed"
---
Vendors for 1g 30s better to just DE
---
Don't forget that all the ship-jumpers mass-exodusing off the imbalanced servers \*ARE ONLY MAKING THE PROBLEMS WORSE\*.  Instead of sticking it out and being inconvenienced, they turn tail and run; hoping their next sever is more "balanced" IE: they are the favored faction and can have a free ride through honor town, doing the same things that were done to them which forced them to leave.
---
And yeah, they love to blame blizzard.
---
Saying you'll reach 60 in 5-6 weeks at your rate is a pretty ideal situation, assuming you'll only need 5-6 days playtime (which is definitely on the quicker side of leveling), you'll keep playing 24 hours a week, and you'll only play your warrior (warriors are notoriously frustrating to level as a first character given their dependence on gear). Lots of first time players regularly take 10-12 days playtime to reach 60.
---
What's your playtime to level 22? That will probably give you a better idea how far you are from 60, as level 22 is only around 12% of the way to 60. Multiply your current playtime by 8 and that'll be the total time it'll take you to reach 60 at your current rate.
---
&gt;and haven't adequately addressed it still.
---
The complete fucking lack of acknowledgement and response is *Infuriating*. I shouldn't be surprised, becuase it's par for the course, but I'm old enough to remember when this company had good pr and customer service. Can we petition for #nochanges for THAT?
---
To play Diablo Immortal and keep up with our mission tables.
---
You're so hopelessly naive and arguing in such bad faith that it's honestly mind boggling.
---
The objective of this game is to recreate an experience from 15 years ago, only at the surface level. In the end of the day it's still a product aimed to generate profit for a massive corporation, and as an MMO with a subscriptionn that hinges on its long term success over any other niche objective. Which is why they released with mega-servers and layers, with modern day conveniences to the interface, addons and updated graphics, they released on 1.12 rather than give us completely broken patches, they've made changes that weren't strictly vanilla-like, etc etc. Changes made to improve the health of the game and the servers / playerbase, however much you want to pretend such a thing doesn't exist.
---
That's all because they care more about keeping the game running in the long term, than having the most faithful recreation of vanilla possible, which is pretty smart considering A) A lot of people don't care about 100% vanilla-like and B) Many people didn't even play during vanilla for them to care that much anyway.
---
It'd be way more financially clever for them to make small adjustments to a system that's downright broken, which affects virtually everyone participating in that system, than to tweak a raid which serves its purpose just fine. Make it too hard, the casuals are all blocked out and stop playing since it's literally the introductory raid. Make the PvP system more meaningful, the casuals have an incentive to keep participating in it beyond rank 4-5 and hardcore players can actually enjoy competition rather than a mindless waste of time.
---
I'll tell my Sulfuras about my MC troubles, thank you for the meaningless ad hom.
---
&gt; We tried to make a noble charge out of MC to clear it and get the rest of our guys in. Only to be flattered by multiple raids on Tuesday.
---
Lol we did exactly the same thing. Around 30 of us managed to get into MC during a lull in the action and as we were waiting on more of our people to show up, our raid leader steps out of the instance and says "guys leave the instance, there's only like 10 Alliance out here and we can kill them."
---
So we all ran outside and... there were a lot more than 10 Alliance out there. We got our asses handed to us in spectacular fashion.
---
Or about diminishing returns of - 25% per sane player kill, because who counts it, when they AoE / ress kill macro nearest enemy player.
---
Thanks. Sound extremely OP.
---
So you're saying that evasion doesn't actually help the warriors cause the rogue is dead anyways... don't get the point of your first comment if that's the case
---
Git gud noob
---
NP. Let me know if it increases your deeps.
---
Have you done the priest benediction quest? Curious how it compares. I did it a few weeks ago and felt very similarly. 
---
It was definitely the most expensive quest I've ever done.
---
Best\_Effort\_Brewing above
---
I got downvoted heavily for saying that classics PvP system is simply the worst that we ever experienced. It’s funny seeing all of the complaints.
---
Arcanite Reaper sounds a lot like Earthfury.
---
I moved to Earthfury from Kromcrush and the server felt like a ghost town. Hardly anybody about and finding a group (even as a healer) was difficult. Fast forward a couple of weeks and suddenly lots more people transferred.
---
[Our once quiet little realm is now bustling](https://ibb.co/B4DysPM)

but actually im only level 46 =\_( I play as often as I can I swear
---
Mega servers are not #nochanges and 100% the issue here. It's not Horde. It's not Alliance. It's not neckbeards or noobs. It's unmanageable server pops, period.
---
I'm not sure how the /use \[@cursor\] Thorium Grenade interacts with stopcasting (you might not be able to use it together) but you need a /stopcasting with your grenade macro so that you can cancel out your grenade if it looks like it's not going to hit or to bait people cd's
---
&gt; Faction based queue that kicks in when its 52 and 48, with free faction change off the bat. Population API and in game that shows what server is what.
---
That is the KEY part, having it day 1 means if you want to force a faction balance, they either don't play at all or roll alliance.
---
But it's the best hairstyle.
---
For me it’s dwarves. I hate dwarves.
---
Can get one from someone in your group being a dumbass, and I don't know how you're getting camped as a rogue, but sure lol. I'm saying a good portion of them aren't trying to be mean. I'm on an 80/20 server and most of the PvP encounters I've been in haven't been fun or fair. Nobody's enjoying themselves pvping, if you care about ranking up you just take everything you can get.
---
people wanted classic.  
---
People got classic.
---
Not Blizzard's fault that people can't stop bringing retail mentality to Classic.
---
/u/TheRealRecollector, what you have just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
That is ugly as fuck
---
Stalagg life. Geeman played it well.
---
Just here for my little gay flower.
---
me and my leveling friend are pretty aggro (we alliance on fairbanks, its like 30% alliance 70% horde i think by 35% 65%.) We see someone who is at least green its a kill. at first we thought "nonono its a 2v1, dont kill them". but now, after being ganked by 19 twinks with their level 60 buddies making sure they dont die we stopped being so nice. We never camp the body and look for a second kill, we are a one and done type of aggro. I feel like we need more one and done type of players. I met one level 27 orc warrior who absolutley decimated me and my friend (we were level 19 rogue and warrior at the time). But we rez'd and he came at us again and patted us on the head and waved, no killing. we need more of those kinds of people.
---
There's more to the game than raids though. Tank pally is perfectly valid for dungeons and solo play. Ret is a bit further back but as you found out more than acceptable as well. 
---
Also, I personally feel that ret pallys are fine for raids. We've got a couple in our guilds and nobody complains. I think there's a min/max culture that sees them as somewhere between 15-20 on the meters and wonders why they exist. Then they forget about the off heals they gave during ony, the improved might on all the melee classes, or the auras and wipe prevention they offer.
---
I posit that ret pallys are fully viable for dungeons and raids, theres just this min-max mindset that exists that people use to try to prevent people from playing what they want because it's "not optimal". 
---
MC can be cleared in 30 minutes. If a pally wants to be ret and raid, I say let them!
---
Sudden? It was already an issue at least 2 months ago.
---
12AM server time. They are there all night and all day. As you can see on spy there is another horde raid around as well, so they have some company.
---
I don't think reporting does anything. Blizzard should either just allow safespotting or actually enforce their rules, because at the moment they don't do either.
---
Basically an Orcish duel of honor
---
Are you a child?
---
Classic had a lot of mistakes that blizzard fixed later on but made the game worse. I would love if they could have used the last 15 years of experience to fix the issues in a better manor. A lot of the talent trees weren't fully thought out for example. 
---
I mained a Druid in vanilla and started to again in classic. I stopped at level 40 because by then I was fully reminded how gimped the class is. I think the way they originally designed the druid class was very innovative and amazing but it ultimately didn't fully work. TBC fixed a lot of that, but eventually they gave us a res. That felt kinda lame and while it was a huge buff to the class it started destroying what was unique about the class.
---
&gt; Lock character creation for vastly overpopulated faction
---
Locking character creation doesn't do anything if the account is already on the server.  You could lock allowing new accounts to go there.
---
&gt;Create free transfers from overpopulated faction to other less populated servers or servers with a deficient of their faction.
---
And people aren't doing this.
---
&gt;Reduce max server size back to classic launch size. preferably smaller (this will create queues in the small term on the biggest servers)
---
Not actually the problem as many private servers had populations on par with the larger servers.
---
&gt;Make faction specific queues for servers with queues.
---
This only changes what people are bitching about.
---
&gt;Fix Everlook/Gadgetzan guards for real this time.
---
 #nochanges bro
---
&gt; If you don't really wanna fix the imbalance then just implement paid character transfer.
---
People will bitch about GREEDY BLIZZARD MAKING ME PAY TO KEEP PLAYING.
---
Most solutions solve either one aspect of the problem, or in some cases nothing at all.  If you "solve" a problem by simply creating a different one then you didn't solve the problem you are only rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
---
Like it or not, Sharding is the easiest solution which has the least negative effects.  People don't want it because it sounds too much like a retail solution.  Yea well people wanted world pvp and they got it!  Now they don't like it so I don't really care.
---
these servers are so overpopulated that their will be too many Grand Warlords to known them all.  But I will certainly respect their  dedication if I meet one.
---
My city of orange!
---
Sounds about right tbh lol
---
Take the transfer to earthshaker, it will be ally sided pvp server
---
Thanks! I wasn’t the best tank ever in vanilla, but I was pretty decent. Main tanked through AQ, we weren’t firsts or anything but progressed fairly well. I don’t mind putting in the work to (re)learn everything I need to. That’s part of the fun to me. Was more just worried about the time frame and finding a guild lol
---
&gt;AND it happened on pservers
---
Which ones?
---
All the popular well always very well balanced, and it was always encouraged.
---
I was on the same boat but had to respec fury in order to raid with my guild since they were full on tanks.
---
Was afraid of going fury since i wanted to tank dungeons but damn i was wrong. You can tank anything in fury and i'm not even fury/prot, i'm fury/arms lol
---
I just get my shield when it's a hard boss or something, otherwise always DW

---
Ehh I doubt it. If Queue times didn't make them transfer yet then it likely isn't that much of a problem to them.
---
“What I do in PVP is fair and honorable, what others do is cheap griefing.”
---
-Everyone
---
Are transfers available in classic?
---
They bear most of it. 
---
You're a dominant faction griefing the shit out of the lesser faction, you shate some blame too.
---
I totally agree. When we bought ours I was shocked at how horribly made they were. I tried to reinforce some of the stitching to the point that one of them was almost entirely over stitched. My husband was like, stop! You could just make one from scratch with all that work.  So we just cleaned them and put them away. We use them as a cautionary tale lol. Don't buy things like this in bulk. Buy one then test drive it.  Would come out so much nicer if you just make one yourself. I do like the stuffed animals,but the clothes are awful. Thin, fall apart stitching. We have spent so much money over the years on clothes. We did get one shirt, ONE, that was good quality. It was a Dalaran shirt. Not sure why, but it has lasted and was a nice heavy t shirt. Everything else...tissue paper. Now we just make our own stuff from purchased fan art, and purchased logos ect ect.
---
Where are some good spots to PvP solo as an alliance Spriest? I play on a 40A/60H server.
---
Funny that you actually set out a decent argument and then end it by calling someone a "selfish piece of shit" - kind of takes away from the entire tone of your post.
---
Your post acts as though no one else needs an epic mount either.  We all need gold for various reasons.  Now the typical response for people that say "I can't find a tank" is for people to tell them they should have rolled a tank.  So in that vein for those tanks complaining they can't farm maybe they should have rolled a class that can farm and solo things?  No?
---
I ran as a DPS in Scholo last night with a group that just greeded everything that dropped.  Guess what.. I made 15-20 gold.  So did our tank... everyone can co-exist with people reserving everything.  Ironic that I am being the one called a "selfish piece of shit" when discussing another player that literally wants EVERYTHING from a dungeon - guess that's not selfish?  ROFL.
---
Bye troll.
---
On top of that, I would recommend hakuris leveling guide if you aren't the best quester. It's made for ally warriors so it makes questing doable.  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6BHM2x23\_glF-LccESn0JPur-HFhi4rFEQC94DDWKg/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6BHM2x23_glF-LccESn0JPur-HFhi4rFEQC94DDWKg/edit)
---
&gt;Hybrid dps are just poorly balanced in vanilla. Their utility isn't enough.
---
&gt;Blizz fixed this mostly in TBC. You wanted a shadow priest for mana battery for example. They also did comparable damage to pure DPS classes. 
---
&gt;In vanilla, hybrid dps utility isn't good enough, and their damage is way too low. People do understand that a clutch BOP can save a dungeon group a wipe, but a holy pally could have done the same thing. Why ever bring a ret specifically?
---
&gt;I'm not saying hybrid dps aren't worth playing with. Just be honest they're poorly balanced and aren't as good.
---
We routinely bring multiple ret pallys to raids and have no problems clearing the content. 
---
I am being honest, and I'm saying that wanting them to be as good is the whole damn problem. I'm glad they're not. 
---
There's way more to WoW than min-maxing nearly 2 decade year old content.
---
What? No way that works
---
Well, all of them had the option to roll PVE or not to roll alliance on PVP, so I get your point.
---
Mage itemization/spell hit question. Won the choker of enlightenment last night. My neck (star of mys) and belt (banthok) are my only two +hit pieces (T1 helm has eluded me, but I do have T2). I'm slowly working at the R7 grind for my +hit pvp boots but doubt I get them until January bc I'm fairly casual. Currently specced 3/3 ele precision with the additional +2% hit from gear. 
---
**Question**: I know I'm not even hit capped for raid bosses as it stands, but how much +SP makes it worth dropping the +1 hit? Is this choker (+18sp) even an upgrade to my current neck (+1 hit)? Maybe for pvp/dungeons but not raid bosses?
---
Because I bought my phone so I could browse Reddit at work and play Rome Total War.
---
I have one at 39 and, no joke, five in 20-30 and enjoying myself greatly.  I level a new character whenever a friend joins and loving it.
---
I would take the transfer before the window ends.
---
It will happen, and you will be corpse camped in your major city.
---
Facebook existed in 2005... and vanilla launched late 2004 so social media DID exist.  We were too busy posting party pics and using it to connect to people then though because businesses and privacy hadn't ruined it yet.
---
They should fix the fucking chat too
---
Nothing that will make your butt hole tighter than failing 2 Black Lotus picks in a row.
---
Do shards despawn when logged off?
---
Is the first part /s? Games can absolutely be time well spent. Happiness in relationship is a separate thing and there are people with any combinations of relationship happiness and game involvement
---
I'm sure this happens because they are trying to prevent THIS:  [https://allthatsinteresting.com/corrupted-blood](https://allthatsinteresting.com/corrupted-blood) 
---
Basically in Vanilla (and I remember this) a hunter pet brought back a ZG Hakkar Debuff that basically killed lowbies instantly, and spread causing a ~~wave~~  ~~a sea~~ a GLOBAL TORRENT of death. They had to patch it because the game was literally unplayable (look at some of those photos).
---
&gt;That is the KEY part, having it day 1 means if you want to force a faction balance, they either don't play at all or roll alliance.
---
So the solution is either Blizzard tells people to either fuck off and not play, which they don't want, or people have to play the other faction, which they don't want.
---
I want to know how it ends up being better than just sharding/layering.  You are right that decisions come with tradeoffs.  The decision people had to be alliance came with the tradeoff they are going to be outnumbered.  It's amazing how none of these solutions involve anything which is possibly a tradeoff for the alliance.
---
Do you actually know what the current server caps are? I see the overcrowding argument being thrown around a lot, but I haven't seen anyone actually backing it up with numbers or quotes. How are you sure it is higher than vanilla?
---
Are they doing cross realm battle grounds?
---
Alliance camps brm and diremaul on my server. But its all the horde dick bags ruining this game! Where is the honest pvp! Hello sir may I 1 v 1 you?
---
Exactly.  Most good players can only stomp pugs for so long and dodge games that would actually be a challenge for so long before they start to question why they are even ranking.
---
I agree that most guilds will do it that way because most guilds don't do organized PvP to assist whoever is raiding that night. More hardcore or serious guilds will however, consider PvP vs. PvE gear especially since honestly most of the raid already has several pieces of raid loot.
---
Or... xrealm will combine pvp and pve realm bg queues, Horde will only have 5-10% more player than Alliance, and queues will be less than 10 minutes for horde during peak times; world pvp will primarily be people out in the world running into each other organically (while farming, going to instances, etc) rather than constant zergs groups, except BRM, which will remain very dangerous but far less terrible than it currently is. 
---
Let's give it a few weeks and see how it goes.
---
I play alliance on skeram; and, while the endless corpse runs into BRM are aggravating, I take consolation in the fact that it’s probably an equally lame experience for the gauntlet of horde pulling .05 honor/kill.
---
Ok so I think you are spot on. I didn't play WoW when it first released. I was one of those people who bought WoW Classic as their first ever experience into WoW.
---
And I legit can't relate to any of the posts here because I genuinely am having the time of my life just running around STV and Badlands trying to get to 40! 
---
I think you are spot on when you say players are more interested in clearing content ASAP i'm still enjoying the social sandbox part of everything. It's kinda ironic. WoW veterans made WoW classic possible but they can't enjoy it as much as WoW noobs.
---
No wife or kids - just serious girlfriend I live with. I try not to get too lost in the game because she isnt the biggest gamer but shes a very understanding person and I know the adjustment to this time sync is a little jarring. 
---
Id be further along if I didnt re-roll at 25 on my druid *stupid stupid stupid*
---
Well... you'll get XP once for each BG for turning in the marks quest, right? But then that's it.
---
If them grinding honor (playing the game efficiently) kills the server, there is a deeper problem that needs addressing.
---
MotC also brings more than 1% dodge with the 25 agi alone, you're not losing much vs diremaul dodge.
---
Pvp happening on pvp servers?  Who could have forseen this?
---
I was worried about that also but IF seems pretty popping at all times. LFG channel seems pretty active. I feel like this servers pop exploded bc of alliance refugees. Also earthfury might be the only pvp east coast server option they are allowing right now? There a reddit sub for earthfury server. It’s not big but there’s some posts on there about server balance and pop. For me it feels like a good server so far. Can’t guarantee since I haven’t done any raiding or had a chance to explore wpl or epl. Just brd and feralas so far.
---
I have mount hot keyed. When I need to dis mount I just press the same key I use to mount up to unmount. Then continue with ability
---
vendor price can go through the roof if a gamer girl sells it, though
---
There are special gloves you can wear that have +5, and you can get them enchanted with another +5. Equip them for black lotus.
---
that is the gayest term I ever heard
---
I did as well. Left Skeram before it got too crazy. SM was a nightmare as well as BRD there. Now, I get ganked by horde still, but it's not oppressive like Skeram.
---
STV, Dustwallow Marsh, Desolace, Tanaris, Arathi Highlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Badlands.
---
Ventrillo in 2019 😂you guys are **really** playing classic
---
Nah, PvP means getting stunlocked while riding from the bank to the FP in IF because you haven't been there long enough to unflag...
---
For starters, without ganking the opposite faction to a point where they quit the game
---
So one could say you got it for convenience?
---
no its when they give you bf5 instead of mw
---
Tiny differences, but for me (MH: DB, OH: CHT) the highest DPS according to fight club is in this order:  
---
1. Edgemasters + Omokk's Girth Restrainer
---
2. ACLG + Omokk's Girth Restrainer
---
3. Flameguard + Mugger's
---
Nup. They're the stealthiest rogues in WoWclassic. I mean you ever seen a Tauren rogue? Cos I haven't either. They are REAL stealthy!!
---
Sorry but spending your time griefing low lvls at a flight path is not playing the game. You are literally making a game unplayable for another person so you can get a measly amount of honor. Horde is doing this  to themselves and over fishing the sea is a great analogy.
---
Yes it is Blizzard's fault.  Adding a queue is not restricting access if there's free server transfers.  Did you not see the last free server transfer? They turned off Alliance transfers within hours after beginning. They should have done the same with the faction queue.  Would have solved all problems.
---
Again, you have offered 0 solutions. "hur dur you should have transferred to a server with the exact opposite problem".  Bad logic. Doesn't solve any problems.
---
You don't know what my life is like, but keep the insults coming, it's making you look bad, not me.
---
So far no issues getting groups. My brd groups form up in minutes. ALSO NO CORPSE RUNNING INTO BRD if I take the back door. Had some group members take the front door once and they were ganked BUT only 3-4 times. On my old server it would have been 10-12 corpse runs going in thro the front.
---
Just wondering but how did larger realm caps work in private servers. I see EVERYONE on here blaming the server cap for the current wpvp mess but I personally am not buying That’s the reason. I’m 100% convinced most people on here are talking from their ass based on the interactions I’ve had here about game difficulty and balance, so I’m just wondering how the big cap worked well while also maintaining a healthy wpvp environment in private servers
---
Eh, I don't agree. The people that know what they're talking about knew this was coming and are dealing with it. Those that expected different are the ones moaning and quitting the game. It is what it is.
---
Sorry, my fault. The server was called classic wow.
---
You're aware Spy was heavily nerfed recently and you'd almost have to be completely blind to not see someone within your draw distance well before it notifies you of their presence, right?
---
It doesn’t really reward effort though, just time. AFKers in AV were a huge problem.
---
Ventrillo in 2019 😂**#NoChanges**
---
Currently running the game on my lenovoo laptop which can only handle it on "classic". I watched my buddies stream - super jealous of the updated graphics etc I like em a lot just wish my PC would run em =(
---
Yes. And phoneshots are more convenient than screenshots.
---
Ventrillo in 2019 😂#**NoChanges**
---
the tradeoff is for blizzard, not for the players
---
they either want to keep the nochanges people happy, or take some of the learning that pserver had to deal with (a lot of this behavior was seen in pservers) and apply it to classic.
---
it is not a horde vs alliance thing, it is how bllizard should have managed their classic experience thing.
---
Thats amazing
---
Well put!
---
Actually, server caps are probably in the range of 7000-7500 range based off of census addon data.  Also, server caps were raised drastically during the life of vanilla, from 2500 to 5000+, so the idea that classic server caps are somehow "un-vanilla-like" is asinine.  Sure they are larger, but not by much.
---
What would happen if 5 unflagged Mages, with Sappers, timed a flag/mass AOE?
---
deserved it for all that clicking he was doing.
---
Free ones are available for higher pop servers but I’m not eligible to transfer because I’m the minority faction.
---
Zandalari tribe :)
---
Troll hunters in my guild @ 6% hit + troll racial, no talents.  I'm looking at numerous raid logs with thousands of attacks and the only misses registering are those against immune targets.  It seems very clear that the +5 weapon skill counts as 3% hit and not 1% as you suggest.
---
I am on a pve server so I can very easily tell if a kill counted or not.  We end up with groups of people sitting in cities trying to rez/kill anyone flagged.  I killed a couple of these guys one night and still had zero kills for the day and my weekly kills ended at the exact same 13 kills I had before this past Sunday when I killed them.  Even at the time I knew something was wrong because I simply was not getting credit for the HK at all and they weren't Honorless Targets because other people in our group were getting credit.
---
How dare you have fun and do something thats not the best
---
What cast bar do you use?
---
No, private servers had peak concurrent player counts far higher than what we have on classic. No one refers to total users when they talk about private server populations, that's a number which is almost never known.
---
The only number that anyone cites is peak population.
---
Following that logic anything but eat, sleep, and work is a waste of time
---
I’m assuming doing this ports you to the dungeon entrance?
---
Something something bath water
---
I am sure there are people who would be fine with it.  But much like server transfers in general, those people would not be enough to make a significant difference.
---
Here's to not ranking!
---
Pupper pals at least top 5 worldwide for Onyxia execution. Too lazy to check their MC but it's respectable. Too bad DD still has no lionheart helm lmao.
---
pve realms are slightly alliance heavy because they don't care about pvp as much, hence why they're on pve realms, and they're 1/3rd the population of pvp realms.  adding pve realms to the mix isn't going to fix pvp realms massive horde imba
---
Ugh, reminds me of this undead priest that lived in wetlands. Dude would spawn outa nowhere every time, was like a real life Marsh lurker.
---
I never said supply and demand dont affect prices not implied anything like that. I claimed that this situation was exaggerated and ultimately wouldnt affect the economy and it hasn't. So idk what you are trying to prove. This was faked and you are still falling for it
---
Blizzard themselves said a full vanilla realm is similar to a low pop classic realm.
---
Factiooooon queueueuueueueuessssssss. The playerbase will sort themselves out. I say this as a horde on stalagg. My guild needs an extra push to move to heartseeker.
---
Honestly, I think the "Horde racial advantage" is a bit if a misnomer that has caused a lot of people to go Horde. Horde may have great facials for 1v1, 3v3, etc, but in Battlegrounds, Alliance have Paladins.
---
People underestimate how powerful it is to have an extra dispel on your team, blessing of freedom, and more. Organized alliance groups in WSG are gonna make a lot of Horde salty when they gave to fight decked out HPals.
---
Don't get me wrong, shamans are still pretty good burst damage, but resto shamans are basically a free HK on the battlefield and totems unfortunately can get outranged / left behind by a rapidly shifting battlefield.
---
If you kill him in under 25 seconds you don't have to decurse at all. The magic resistance buff Shazz gives himself is irrelevant as long as you have a priest assigned to dispell it.
---
For me, This just all comes down to what an individual looks for in a guild. I personally just want to raid with my guild. I do work a lot and when running dungeons idc to just pug. So I feel like I am a lot like OP. The guys that OP is talking about might want a more inclusive guild and that is OK too. Your guild might not be the guild for him. He wouldn't like my guild either but i am sure there is a guild out there that does everything together and that's the one he needs to find.
---
Exactly, every character is like a new story almost (except dungeons of course)
---
&gt;  Two players could both put in 20 days /played - one over the course of a few months (hardcore), and the other over the course of a year (casual). The hardcore would be deck out in full epics. But the casual players would be in mostly blues and maybe an odd epic or two. Equal time commitment, but the casual players lags significantly behind because WoW rewards concentrated time commitments.
---
So 
---
one player play 20days of game time in a few months or about 7-16 hrs/day 
---
one player play 20 days of game in a year so like 1.5 hrs/day. 
---
It is obvious that with their speed, after 1 year the former will always leave the latter in the dust in any kind of game, not just wow.
---
In the high 50's.  Been fishing a lot, farming up for my arcanite reaper, so I can smash alliance dickwads in AV at 59.
---
The +15 is from using our mouths, dummy.
---
I play on preset 3 #NoChAnGeS
---
It probably explains why I am one of the few people who enjoys a chill experience of doing a few quests, fucking around in gadgetzan not really progressing, wandering around gathering herbs here and there, etc. I even enjoy paladin leveling because it's super laid back. The odd time I join a group where the tank or dps are rush rush rush I end up super tense and do not have a good time at all.
---
Probably goes back to my Final Fantasy 11 days where you'd spend 6 hours with the same people in a chill exp grind party. Love that shit
---
If the above are the requirements for a good guide, then I would say that most, if not all, PvP guides are bad.
---
I understand if situations are too complex to fully explain, but I would like to at least see mention of individual matchups, what my opponent wants to do and how I can play against that. And how different spec options would play into said matchups.
---
As an example; I have no idea how to fight against Mages as a Hunter. Either they start the fight and I just die, because I will get Frost Nova'd at some point which basically ends the fight. Or I start the fight which allows them to just run away or turn on me if they are in range for Blink + Frost Nova which then ends the fight. Both of these outcomes happen because the Mage can Ice Block when they are Freezing Trapped and that isn't something I can prevent.
---
Yes, and luckily for you there is at least one guild who can clear all that content during the 3 hour block of time that you can log in!  Not everyone has that option.
---
You are throwing shade at the nochanges crowd when the problem exists directly because of a change they made. Servers were not meant to be as big as they made them. There should be 10x the amount of servers with a cap on pop
---
This looks awful, you butchered it
---
I predict the BG servers will crash a couple times, maybe even get ddos attacked.  Then people that are in the open world will benefit for a brief few hours.  Those in BGs will not be able to log into their characters.
---
It is not locked. for EU Eng I believe only Noggenfogger and Shazzrah is locked. Last time there was a transfer update this realm had not as worse faction ratio as Noggenfogger or Shazzrah. What I have gathered from reddit is that top guilds at alliance side collaborated and everyone transfered off.
---
But my Furry guild just transferred there.
---
Did you watch the video? The whole (or at least the main) point of using tanks that are less effective than Warriors is because of the massive tank drought everyone's suffering through right now.
---
&gt; Druids: Can tank 90% of the content well. **A few fights they can't tank**
---
In raids, maybe, but can you list the 5-man content that is impossible for a Feral Druid to tank? Besides, there's no tank shortage in raids right now.
---
Hey, on a pve server I am up to like rank 4 after abou 500 HKs, with the vast majority of those coming from TM/SS in the first weekend of the honor system.  I was like 100th last week with my 13 kills and maybe 1100 honor.
---
Fuckin woosh.
---
You may have already. I'm bad at PvP.
---
I don't know man, I'm thoroughly enjoying world PvP. Currently level 50 and had many fun experiences. There's just something about trying to level while looking out for Alliance, always being on guard like it's actual war. It's a thrill when you see a high level or 2 and your heart races begging to the gods thet won't gank you. Sometimes they do sometimes they dont. Or how about being attacked by someone 5 levels higher than you but somehow you turn it around and win? Being ganked, res, and seeking revenge is always a blast as well. I've even had moments where I ran into friendly alliance - hell sometimes we helped eachother finish a quest. Yes there are some people that will camp you but thats when you laugh it off and stare at them getting bored waiting while you eat a bowl of chili. It's all a part of Classic and I love it! World PvP is rush.
---
&gt;The methods are refined, content has been explored, it's all about efficiency now.
---
Playing games for efficiency? That sounds like fun.. (ro)bots would like to play vanilla you think?
---
Don't people play it for the community, for the social aspect anymore?
---
He’s saying lots of things, they are mostly irrelevant to the conversation.
---
The issue is: would server caps kill a server, he’s saying that one faction could be so skilled at camping in an balanced server that would cause one faction to quit, and he also hypothesizes this would lead to a death spiral and the server would end up dead.
---
That’s insane on its face for any number of reasons, none of his assumptions are valid, and his conclusion is ridiculous
---
We weren't talking about over the course of a year.  We were talking about over the course of 20 days /played.
---
Right. Those people can’t admit that retail just followed the trends among players.
---
Watching some dirty orc pick my herbs and not be able to do anything about it is soooo much more frustrating than being ganked once in awhile, though!
---
What's wrong with Incendius? The only time I hit queues is during raid nights and even then it's &lt;30 minutes.
---
Horde/ally ratio is pretty balanced too.
---
Agreed. Thinking otherwise is just team sports/tribalism.
---
Big fan of EPGP. 
---
Much faster and fairer than dkp.
---
Im just saying its a trade off. I was honestly expecting alliance to be the more populated faction because they have the raiding edge.
---
Also alliance arent lost when it goes to pvp. I think factions are very close to be fair. Pallys can wreck undeads. And humans can see stealthed rogues which is huge.
---
Everyone always forgets about Darn
---
This hunter cast serpent sting like 6 times in a row wtf is wrong with him.
---
I can tell your fortune and you don't need to wait in a queue.
---
Your death will be pointless onside black rock mountain.
---
Well, if it's how I remember it in Vanilla, it will try to pair you with a group on your realm *first* before trying to pair you cross Realm.
---
If there's no alliance to pair with, there *may* be longer **queue** for those Horde. We won't know till Tuesday
---
Man Gnomes are bad but Male Night Elf Hunters seems to be the “Undead Rogue” of the Alliance. I’ve never seen one who didn’t attack on sight and spam emotes. The female ones seem much less likely to attack, which makes sense since it seems like the go to alliance hunter pick if you don’t like the dwarf hunter look and they aren’t trying to be Legolas or something.
---
I did a lot of customisation with it which took some time but was worth it in the end
---
Dude!! Picking lotus is the only wow moment that legitimately makes my heart rate increase.
---
I really REALLY want blizz to open up paid transfers to PvE realms.
---
I regret rolling PvP so much... my friends suggested it and it has been miserable. Took me half an hour (as horde, mind you) to get to Scholomance yesterday. The fairness is part of the problem. You won't get 1v1... that doesn't exist.
---
If you are looking for a good horde guild let me know later or shoot me a PM.  Almost our entire guild transferred off Skeram to Arcanite reaper we have plenty of people that would be glad to run higher level dungeons pretty regularly.  If you are online and see someone from knocked Loose shoot them a message and say Bright sent you.
---
What's the best way to farm demonic runes for robes of the void / felcloth gear?
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
Frost mages have 90% of their toolkit by level 20. However they get most of that right at 20. 
---
Blizzard, Blink, Cold Snap, Teleport and Evocation are all earned at level 20 (talented in Cold Snaps case)
---
From the spreadsheets I’ve looked at, +1% hit is the equivalent to about 6-8 spell power.   Granted, this varies slightly based on your current gear, but this should remain pretty consistent.
---
I say wear the choker hands down.
---
Itachi - Kromcrush
---
I've learned this lesson many times in my 20 odd years of playing games with people. Never expect anyone but yourself to stick around. Dont play the faction you hate because your friends are playing it. Chances are they'll quit after a month and you'll be by yourself again, hating it. Play for yourself.
---
I love that this is your crowd's excuse now. It couldn't be that there was a flaw in your precious vanilla, Blizzard just let too many people play the game together!
---
It's like a broken record in all these threads, always the same words over and over.
---
Yep, some Horde players are absolutely pathetic
---
Some poor village has lost its idiot. It would in no way change how many r14s are in the game??? I did play vanilla and classic is WAY more on the pServer side than actual vanilla. You can reach exalted in one weekend for AV and after that, most wont touch it again. You’ll find out how stupid you are at your own pace. I’m not going to rush you into it.
---
WoW isn't like those modern free to play games that need micro transactions to survive. You are either underestimating the subscription fees or overestimating micro transactions. Do you really think if blizzard scares away half the Classic players the remaining ones will start buying pets for 12 bucks a month on average in addition to their subscription to make it a profitable decision? Not a chance if you ask me.
---
nope, even if both parties agree to it its bannable
---
I farm then in the south of tanaris turtle spawns while fishing
---
Well, dead because you’re the hunted feels very different to dead because you’re the hunters and there’s no one to hunt.  You can level alts (without being hassled), PvP in BGs etc.  Long term you’re right of course but I think these players are thinking about what they want the next few weeks to feel like.
---
My main is on Earthfury - horde side. Earthfury was proud of our 50/50 ratio which we carried for quite some time. Now it stands in favor of alliance about 65/35 as we have had quite a bit of alliance guilds transfer here. Even when that said, I would suggest given Earthfury a shot! The level advantage is leaning more towards horde - we have an active discord which you can test your luck on our pvp bounty board for some gold. We also have quite a bit of organized pvp between fractions. While going to dungeons, or raids you might encounter a fight, but you won't be getting corpse camped. A lot of horde guilds have a general "if it doesn't count as honor, why waste my time" thought when it comes to lower lvls leveling.
---
There are no Republicans or Democrats.
---
We all are the same scumbags. 
---
:'(
---
i hope you are joking
---
Hey new to wow not familiar with all the phases and stuff so I’m here to ask what things are worth investing in / stockpiling for the upcoming phases. Thanks all
---
Yep I'm taking a new path of quests on my alt and it's great. Never played Alliance quests much back in the day so it's all new to me.
---
Everyone's system and monitors are different. This looks amazing on my monitor but looks like shit on my mates.
---
Literally all honor addons, including the most popular (honorspy) already account for these diminishing returns.
---
Why the fuck is this flaired discussion?
---
OP has done nothing but insult and gloat over this misfortunes of people who he deems are inferior because they share a different opinion. Furthermore, he gloats over going through the post history of said group when, if you go through OP's post history, you'll find an extensive history of repeating the same 3 or 4 insults and literally never adding anything constructive to any conversation.
---
I've played WoW since 2005; I was/am a member of the #nochanges crowd.
---
I rolled on a PvE server because I've played long enough to know that PvP servers have 1 tragic flaw: if the population isn't balanced within a few percent either way, it's a fucking nightmare. I'm not talking about PvP death-squads in BRM; I'm talking about servers that had 60s chilling next to the Redridge Mountain flight master just waiting to 1-shot every level 19 ally who had the audacity to want to quest there.
---
The above sentiment was trumpeted far and wide before release. Every debate about the (obviously imperfect) honor system warned that PvP servers were not going to be friendly places during the period before BGs were released.
---
You chose to ignore those warnings. Furthermore, you've chosen to pretend that they didn't exist and instead blame Blizzard &amp; classic purists for your lack of foresight. Get over yourself. 
---
Re-roll on a different server or faction, or find another game to play for the next 5 days - You'll still get ganked after the 10th, but world PvP is far less efficient than BGs, so most of those death-squads will be busy.
---
faction queues? yes.
---
can confirm this too!
---
Don't blame Blizzard for what the players did.
---
Honestly the wrost thign about this is that i had so much fun leveling etc but at level 53 the layer removal/phase 2 hit and i just become unable to play so i have bascially stopped.
---
Everywhere i went i got attacked by people comming out of nowhere or giant raids of horde.
---
And at best i manage to get some stuff done but i am always paranoid about someone comming for me which i guess is part of a pvp server but i barley had any pvp issue before phase 2. 
---
Probably 3-4 encounters that turned out hostile. 
---
I guess i am in a weird spot where i do want pvp to happen cause it can be exciting/scary and make the world more alive but at the same time i want to be able to roam the world and enjoy it and do my quest in (mostly peace)
---
I do hope it calms down when BG come out and i can start playing again
---
Yeah but we would have a bagillion dead servers now if Blizzard capped the number of people that could be on each server. Maybe slightly better in the long run but today it would be the Herod queue situation ×10
---

People playing in a kickball league are hardcore kickball players.  You're making our point.

I think I’ve decided to do a warrior with the intention to tank dungeons and dps/ off tank adds in raids if my guild does and alt raid or pugs.
---
nah I got you I got a chuckle out of your response =P
---
I have a pretty decent computer and by 2005 standards it’s like the most advanced piece of tech ever, that being said if I log into org (Herod) I cannot get above 20 frames in peak and the game chugs along. I then hearth to Kargath and SOMEHOW ITS WORSE THAN ORG, I stopped playing for about a month so I had yet to experience layering but by god do I miss it so much
---
You’re assuming that BG’s will fix this.  I kinda doubt it.
---
I like:
---
    #showtooltip devour magic
---
    /cast [mod:alt, @player][@mouseover, exists, nodead] [@target, exists, nodead] devour magic
---
It won't try to cast if you don't have a target, a target you have your mouse over or alt pressed so no glowy hand where you have to click on someone. First it checks if you have alt held down and casts it at you, otherwise casts it at your mouseover target and finally casts it at whoever you have targetted. It will let you use it however you like.
---
Fuck yea dude. I love that shit.   Warriors do some crazy stupid burst some times.  I tried to set up a reck bomb with melee on me.  It... almost went to plan...till It didnt.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO5WxfbLSGs
---
It really doesn't. The number of unique hits varies wildly, so any data is useless.
---
Such a shitty system
---
Not to be mean, but this is kinda a low effort post.
---
And this is more due to the modern client.
---
How would a pet have changed anything, the rogue would have killed it in like 3 secs well the warlock was stunned, no?
---
For sure.  Blameux isn’t even that bad.
---
It's better for everybody when only determined rankers go rank.  less competition from ignorant people who don't realize what they are signing up for is good. Let's say we have 100 people who just jump into  the ranking grind without ever being told that they need to spend the next 3 months in the queues..  Let's assume these 100  people don;t have the time for that.  So they would give up at some point.  Warning these people is a WIN-WIN situation.   They can just pvp when they want it, for enjoyment and bragging rights or whatever reason  and don't waste time chasing an unobtainable goal.  And the people who DO have the time wibn too, as they will have less competition at the higher ranks, so their grind is slighlty easier.
---
16? Bruh that's like 2-3 hours lol. Best of luck.
---
Axes, Nightfall:   [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169) 
---
From what I remember, TBC had very very good BOP Epics like Tailoring does with their chest pieces, so my decision would change if we went that route. For Vanilla, Nightfall is Best for buffing every caster by 15%
---
Classic was my first wow game ever  I was bored to death til I hit lvl 22 that's when I was able to aoe farm and kill a whole group of mobs like it was nothing.
---
More like blaming players for not chilling and spamming no changes for the past 1 year, And whining for 398321 hours about "i don't want my server to die once the initial players leave"
---
Yes, it's screw or be screwed situation but most alliance leaving is due to BRD camping alone. You basically need to spend hours just getting to BRD on most servers. 
---
Accept the fact that people are now gonna leave due to it.
---
Your attitude.
---
Im not making up bullshit. Check the warrior discord lol.
---
Sure, but you’d still play
---
invade the cities
---
Every single thing this guy did pained me, it's like watching a bot duel that has a hard coded rotation that cannot be deviated from
---
I've noticed it only occurs after a certain amount of time on the cc, still experimenting though!
---
Honestly, when they announced world PvP with #nochanges I said fuck that, I remember the grind to 14. I'll wait until TBC if that's what it'll take to not have up deal with the "agreement system" of ranking up ie. agreeing to capped honor amounts to decrease the pain of an already shitty grind to 14.
---
Because they never complained about this change. They should've been on Blizzard's ass instantly about this.
---
Come on, think a little before you try to attempt to make ME look stupid.
---
Make it look like your screen is coated in vaseline?
---
It's not really classic tho... I think most people agree that the faction imbalance would be much more manageable on servers the size they were in 2005.
---
i havent’t posted here much since p2 came out, because, you know..... i’m busy *playing the game*, as opposed to shitposting bad memes and complaining.
---
I think \ works if you put it first so \#showtooltip ambush
---
Just a saltly non-warrior.  He got an awkward boner watching the clip and that is how he is expressing himself.
---
Deviant Delight is the true Vanilla experience.
---
Experience true Vanilla population, both in numbers and ratio. 
---
Experience true Vanilla personality, as the official Dad server, everyone here is over 30.  Everyone here actually played back in Vanilla.  No fortnite kiddies
---
With free transfers ending today, expect paid transfers before xmas
---
Where is the EU version of this?
---
&gt; You see, the entire Honor system and PvP system of 2003 WoW is such an ill fit for a modern gaming setting. It's outdated and just inefficient.
---
It was shit back then too.   I dont know anyone that likes it...
---
When it’s more than one mob
---
Blizzard has already made changes, like increasing the server population cap. They should also have balanced servers properly, which they didn't.
---
Not sure why you're so keen on blaming horde for this.
---
Best place is Felwood for sure. North West is a camp of satyrs that drop them.
---
If not there Azshara also has some satyrs that drop them.
---
Never. If you put the hours in, you're always able to find people at the same level of content as you are.
---
The nice thing about Exalted with WSG/AB is you can pursue it whenever. Yeah, it may not be fast, but progress isn't lost. R14? Take too long of a break, and you're basically screwing over your progress to that point.
---
I already bought Zaelot Blade and Vendetta and already enchanted Vendetta with Fiery Weapon D:
---
I killed two people yesterday that didn’t give an HK.  They were correct level range and I did almost all the damage to them, but someone else jumped in and finished them and I got nothing.
---
Bro what are you even arguing about? Of course people stacked and sold mats and did economy shit. I said this whole situation with this guys
---
 was faked. No one abused layering like this. To a small degree yeah sure but not like this and blizzard confirmed that.
---
Do you still believe any part of this fake drama post? Arcane Crystal's or thorium this whole post was fake and just fear mongering. Do you think Blizzard lied to you when they said this wasnt true? 
---
You helping to drive down thorium prices doesnt prove your theroy that this one guy was going to have as big an impact as you think. And you didnt have as big an impact as you think
---
I agree. People are abusing the system and ruining the playtime for others sure but Blizzard is letting it happen. For the quality of the game I really think Blizz should be merging servers or forcing some kind of transfer that will help these realms. I've been saying it for a while now but almost all of these PvP servers will end up 90% one faction if not more
---
Yeeah, yeah. I've been told by many. That's entirely bullshit. And you know it. 
---
You wouldn't throw away several days worth of work and start over.
---
Yeah it feels like more of a 2-tier system in classic. A debuff is either high priority or gets pushed off. Certainly more testing needed
---
Run the sim yourself. Flurry is worse than CHT as long as you have weap skill.
---
Playing the game 14 hours every day is not a hobby, it's a job you're not being paid for.
---
I know but I transferred over from eso so it’s way different gameplay just trying to get an idea of when I can expect some sort of power boost
---
Not if you're second best at speed runs, you also don't need to attack whelps
---
honorless from flightpath i bet
---
Big question and I'm not trying to cause an argument. If the server's are still as unbalanced as they are in future what will happen with stuff like the war effort for AQ40 opening? If there are no significant alliance presence for example how are both factions going to complete it?
---
I thought i was alone
---
RP in ashenvale, turning around orcs and ud back to splintertree and the barrens is hilarious when they play along
---
If memory serves, since you still get a token for losing, it'd actually be somewhat fewer games.
---
lmao if they listened to #nochanges the servers would be actual vanilla size instead of 10,000 people and the world pvp would not be anywhere near an issue as you could take 10 steps without seeing another player.
---
We're talking about Vanilla here, genius.  Raiders were indeed hardcore relative to the overall playerbase.
---
And yes, anyone that plays in a fucking kickball league is hardcore about kickball.  Jesus Christ, how does this even need to be explained to you?
---
Kill satyrs mobs above level 50. All of those drop both demonic runes and felcloth. You can find them in felwood and azshara mainly.
---
Thanks! I transferred from eso so the combat and just power spike is different.
---
&gt;it was better than what I was using
---
You don't have *any* of the blue 2h weapons from 55-60? It's actually worse than a good number of them.
---
Yessir.
---
If someone didn't complain about the changes then they weren't in the nochange group to begin with, or changed their mind.
---
One thing is for certain, the nochange group can not be blamed for a change made by blizzard.
---
They were probably honorless
---
Yeah, sometimes it's not too bad here, but PvP tends to happen on my PvP server. Do you know anything about Dire Maul? A guildy mentioned they drop there.
---
You could definitely snag yourself a spot in our guild if you swap.  (the free transfers end real soon, so hopefully you make the choice in the next hour :D) We run high level dungeons daily and have raid nights twice a week.  As long as you are in a guild I don't think you will have any trouble finding a group.  There is also a thread on the main page right now talking about Arcanite reaper and it's a good read if you need more convincing. 
---
As for battlegrounds those are going to be cross realm, so I dont think that will be a problem regardless of server size.
---
If you transfer over just send me a message with your character name and I can get you a guild invite later today
---
I see. Thanks for the response. So what you’re essentially saying is that the problem right now is because of player mindset and mentality more so than the server capacity? I can see that making sense and seems more thought out than just saying “make it 3k server pop and everything will be fine”.
---
Jesus Christ it’s a 5 man.
---
Unless you’re trying to speed clear or be top of your server OPTIMIZATION. DOES. NOT. MATTER.
---
Raid Consumables (Elixirs and flasks) and the materials to make them. Materials used for Enchants (Orbs, Essences, etc). Materials for crafting new Reputation gear (Was: Devilsaur, Soon: Bloodvine  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19682](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19682) ).
---
Thank you, that was probably it.   This was outside Gadget in Tanaris so you’re probably right.  I think one threw me off because he rode in from away from town, guess he rode off and decided he needed something from town and turned around fast.
---
Came out August 26th. Roughly 3 months.
---
Even dungeons you get a new role to play so it is refreshing.  After playing a priest I wouldnt want to heal again but i am enjoying doing the dps role as my rogue.  looking forward to trying my hand at tanking next.
---
Definitely just clever use of game mechanics.
---
J. Allen "you think you want it but you don't" Brack turned out to be right this whole time
---
If I played alliance hunter I would play female night elf. I attack a lot more now (troll rogue) with the honor system and I assume they will attack me unstealthed if I don’t attack first.
---
Before honor I wasn’t getting attacked nearly as much.
---
If you're going all the way to DM for shards you might as well learn how to cliff juggle the hyenas and farm shards that way. Once you get the hang of it it's way easier and you don't need any pets at all because you will never get hit
---
The whole "No-changes regret" thing is kind of off topic in a thread about servers being massively overpopulated compared to vanilla, no?
---
“Actually prestigious” lmao man you’re so out of touch with reality.
---
Alright sounds good, thank you very much. Just dont want to start when the power spike is too much with gear etc.
---
This is why twinking is such a fun "hobby" to have in game. Lets you be top dog in BGs without the commitment to raiding thats required to do the same in the lvl 60 bracket. 
---
I dont enjoy raiding myself, so Ill be making do with whatever gear I can get from dungeons. Most likely that will be the quest upgraded dungeon sets; for hunters thats beastmaster. It can actually hold it own against the earlier raid sets, but those quests wont be out until I think Naxx is also released. Naxx gear was rare back in Vanilla. It never really got the chance to "break" the game. This time around I am a little worried that it will given enough time. After a year or two you might see 50% of players in full Naxx in the average AV. Then you better worry cause no dungeon set is gonna come close. It will be like having a 5-level disadvantage.
---
Yeah, definitely been my case over the years cause of FOMO or just wanting to have the time with friends that I wouldn’t get otherwise. I used to be alliance pally on a mid size PvE server(suramar) in vanilla, now I’m horde side on a high pop PvP server(stalagg) lol. Last week I let my sub time out and I think I’m just done for the time being. Just a big time sink and it’s taking away from time irl, so yeah see y’all on the other side lol
---
Yes if you can get a group DM is a good place for runes too. Lots of satyr mobs.
---
No, all 4 server types have *always* been mixed into battlegroups together. In fact, it is likely that we already know our battlegroups somewhat—GUIDs are grouped by subregion, ie US East, US West, OCE, etc. USE is about the same size as USW+OCE, and the latter have always been mixed together due to proximity. I could easily see us having 1 USE battlegroup and 1 USW+OCE battlegroup. Perhaps you would lump LA into the USE group because it can’t sustain itself alone. We’ll see!
---
Felwood + Azshara in the world, Dire Maul East runs for an instance. Edit: As a warlock, are you able to solo the blasted lands / winterspring elites?
---
I think there will be no paid transfer. It would be against the rule. There were free transfers in classic, but no paid.
---
Nah. The horde players are part of the problem. 
---
I’m Horde and a number of players in my guild have made a concerted effort to avoid most of this nonsense. We just play the game as we were before phase 2. If we run into Alliance, we fight, but then we move on to what we were doing. We don’t res kill, we don’t camp instance entrances. If we invade IF, we don’t camp it, we just invade and leave. Etc. etc. 
---
It’s not hard to play the game with a modicum of decency and respect for the other person. 
---
Putting your need for honor ahead of common sense is exactly the problem. Justifying it by trying to put all the blame on Blizzard is silly.
---
Imagine being so desperate to defend people who turned the entire game into a bad experience and prevented an entire faction from actually playing the game.
---
I wanted to get one so bad but they only had them in men’s sizes. I’m a 5ft tall plus size woman. It wasn’t happening D:
---
I love getting Horde raids to chase me around the map. Having an epic mount plus all the mount speed increases is great. None of them can catch me and they will often times run through mobs and die.
---
\&gt;  Cht is 3 crit 20 ap and way more dps
---
CHT is 1% crit not 3.
---
And I did run the sim. I am literally a moderator and one of the maintainers of the sheet.
---
I think you don't understand how Flurry Axe works.
---
If you know an earning report that shows **WoW** earns more with micro transactions than subscriptions fees feel free to link it.
---
You wear aged core leather gloves losing a couple AP from flameguards and get to wear CHT instead of flurry. Tell me how that isnt bis, sheep.
---
I usually adhere to this rule, unless they are botting.
---
I usually check by taking off my weapon and punching them and emoting to see if they emote back.
---
I don't know ferals well but I see two bleeds up a lot, is it not "worth it"?
---
The only mage in the galaxy to do Der Kessel run in 12 parsecs.
---
We're talking MC not Naxx.  I'll let the rest of your comment show your intelligence.
---
I rolled PvP in vanilla because my ex wanted to. I stayed PvP in vanilla because by the time we broke up I had enough time invested to not want to reroll. 
---
I rolled PvE this go. I don’t have time for corpse campers. 
---
I did my time in Vanilla and BC (ESPECIALLY BC.....freaking pally) with being camped.
---
Honestly don't think it's a big problem overall. Only now since Bg's aren't out yet.
---
Elysium and nostalrius didn't have this huge problem when bg's were out.
---
It's just the only way to farm honor, and once bg's are out it's then the most optimal way for honor. It's a temporary issue.
---
20 is a big level.  Unless you're getting tons of adds or over-pulling, you shouldn't be dying much.  Single mobs you can pull from max distance and either face tank until dead or nova &gt; move back &gt; resume blasting.  
---
Fireball x2 &gt; nova &gt; Fireball &gt; Scorch &gt; Fire Blast should kill 95% of mobs up to same level. 
---
If you're frost, replace fireball with frostbolt.  Sheep adds, nova additional adds + burn original target.  If it's hairy, nova and/or CoC and turn and blink (20+).  Byyyyye.
---
And it's the exact same scenario on the very few alliance dominated servers. This has NOTHING to do with horde or alliance and everything to do with human nature and faction balance.
---
Cool, I figured +18sp would be worth it but was wondering what the rough hit=SP conversion would be. Thanks! Do you have a go-to spreadsheet/calculator?
---
That's literally not the definition of what is considered or not considered against ToS.
---
There were paid. I expect paid transfers as well soon.
---
What is this of people thinking classic is being rushed? They are going at a perfectly reasonable pace for a 15 year old game and can still make "new" content releases for the full 2 years. 
---
Phase 1 Launch - August 26th 2019
---
Phase 1.5 Dire Maul - October 2019 
---
Phase 2 Honor System - November 2019 (3 months) End
---
Phase 2.5 Battle Grounds - December 10th 2019
---
Phase 3 - Early 2020 (Probably February (6 Months)
---
Phase 4 ZG - Probably Juneish time frame? 5 / 6 months after BWL. BWL / MC farming will happen for a LONG time. This may come a bit sooner as well. Maybe mayish since this is a BWL catch up raid.
---
Phase 5 AQ gates - Probably August time frame, 3-5 months after ZG. It will take a few weeks for gates to be opened, and another raid with MONTHS of farming. 
---
Phase 6 Naxx - Guessing this will happening sometime Late Quarter 1 or Early Quarter 2 of 2021 which will give 6 months of Naxx for the full 2 years of content. Then classic will continue to live forever. 
---
The thing about Classic is that there isn't a lot of content to do in phase 1. All of the important WoW features come in phases 1-3 so they're going to be a little faster. Molten Core, Honor systems, and BWL. After BWL is released there is enough content for people to do a couple nights a week and it will take a while for people to get geared for the next step. 
---
When phase 4 is released for ZG it will open up a whole new gear farm and you can do this almost twice a week. People will have plenty to do. Right now the problem is people logon for raid for 2 hours, 1 night a week and then log off because there isn't BGs or anything else to do. WPVP blows on most servers so nobody wants to play. 
---
If you think classic is going too fast, you're just drunk.
---
no but any lock spec that isn't braindead DOT spam tends to guzzle shards pretty quickly
---
Dkp blind bid is a pretty good system, it prevents a lot of the issues people don't like in the fixed cost and ep/gp systems.
---
I also like +1 Ms/Os but if there are a lot of people subbing in and out of raids week after week it can lead to people spending a loong time not getting an item they want.
---
Another system I've heard was a +1 Ms/Os but before the raid you declare your top 3 item picks,. Anyone with a #1 can roll on the item, if no one has it as 1 then 2s go and then 3s,. If you choose to roll on something earlier that no one else wanted I think it bumps one of those spots, maybe 3rd first
---
No changes!! 
---
Easily the best choice for an EU PvP server at the moment
---
5 days too early?  BGs on the 10th, bro.
---
Log out before you revive, keep giving them 0 honor. They won't stop killing you, but they will be pissed.
---
The LW pattern, Herbalist’s Gloves, is Alliance-only though. I see the crafted gloves on the Horde AH occasionally though.
---
It’s not gonna fix shit. I also got a month left so we will see
---
There has been a priest actively scamming enchanting mats from players on Kurinnaxx for weeks now, Blizzard has done absolutely nothing to him.  He's been blacklisted on the disc and sub reddit, but lots of players dont actively check those forums and I daily see victims of his posting in trade chat.
---
As an undead mage, I couldn’t agree more
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they start up some fresh progression servers. But probably not for a couple years.
---
What I do on my druid is run SM graveyard. You can clear it 5 times pretty fast at 60 so you will get locked out, but I actually don't mind this because it gives you a chance to take a break, put stuff on the ah, whatever.
---
You can get a lot of nodes of grave moss in gy and a stack of it goes for 17g on my server. In 5 runs you can pretty much have a stack or at least close to a stack. The only problem with gy is that a lot of it is random so it isn't always constant. The grave moss nodes can either be grave moss or kingsblood. Pick it all just because even though kingsblood doesnt have crazy prices, but you're there so why not.
---
What I generally do is skip all the scarlet mobs, unless there is an unlocked chest in the first room, then I kill the mobs around it. Kill all bosses and vendor shit. Once you get in the gy proper I generally just gather up all the non elite ghost mobs in bear form and kill all of them in one go with barksin+hurricane. Then go down in the crypt and kill the last boss. Check for chests because I believe there can be 3-4 chests that have a chance to spawn there, some will be locked, some wont, you might get really bad rng and have all of them locked. But either way, vendoring all this junk actually is decent money.
---
It's mindless, maybe not THE best money maker, but hey... it's safe and you can watch some netflix or something at the same time.
---
It dies out at 10 pm.
---
It's probably due to spell batching. Kinda like how as a mage you can hit someone that is frozen with 2 spells back to back, and both will receive the shatter crit chance increase, even if the first spell would have technically broke the freeze. If they happen within a short amount of time (reckoning is near instant), then all hits in that small amount of time will get the bonus.
---
Hi, /u/Phishyboy

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e6kvk3/alliance_is_just_as_bad_as_horde/). 
---
now THIS is the authentic vanilla experience.
---
I just do dungeons and raids as ret, make the dungeon group yourself, ret does alright in dungeons
---
Herod is strange. Horde hold the outside and alliance control instance portals
---
When I hit 60 I said the exact opposite. SO MUCH TO DO NOW WHERE DO I START?!
---
Profession max, gold farming, Pre-raid BIS, BIS, farming mats for future content, pvp, etc.
---
but there will also be 99% less alliance keeping the death squads busy.  when a horde raid finds your lvl 10 in goldshire, they'll camp you all day because they have nothing else to do and you're the only allliance out there for them to play with
---
I always wondered what the point was of having that as a racial, and the point of that enchant even existing.  Then I came across a black lotus and it took me about 5 attempts to pick it at 300.
---
The huge servers change the world PvP for sure, and absolutely for the worse.  But R14 isn't really any different, in vanilla you had to be the biggest no lifer on your server to get it, just like right now.  If anything it is slightly easier on the mega servers because it is percentage based there will be 5+ R14s on the big servers most weeks, instead of just one and occasionally two in vanilla.  Now instead of being the biggest no lifer, you just have to be one of the top 5(out of 5 times as many people)!
---
Which kinda makes you wonder why the system itself can't just account for it for you.
---
You lose combo points when you drop target in classic.
---
What server situation?  And if you are talking about overpopulation, they offered free transfers.
---
I suggest Paladin or Mage.
---
I seriously can't tell if you're serious or not with this whole thing
---
Not sure on this one. I know he tanks, and I feel like maybe he needs pointers. :3
---
&gt; Since layering is gone and now the supply is fixed and the demand is consistent
---
Not until those who stacked it with help of layering stop listing or run out of supply which still hasn't happened. That's the entire point of all of this - people abused layering and it is affecting the economy. My point wasn't the prediction. The prediction was only to show I knew it was being overfarmed and stacked with layering. 
---
The price will go up again but won't recover to its original price. But that increase wont start to happen for a while still.
---
They will go wherever players are.
---
Migraine eu best alliance server, we are constantly gang banged by horde and we LOVE it!
---
I'm skeram alliance and I think skeram is an interesting case for this.  Especially on alliance but horde included our server has a disproportionate number of speed clearing guilds.  We have 8 in the top 50 NA on alliance alone and ally is just 25% of the server.  BTW at least 3 of those guilds have second raids as well.  I'm less informed on horde but even I know they have 3 speed clearing guilds minimum also in that under 50.
---
TL;DR &lt; Skeram has a lot of hardcore pve guilds&gt;
---
It may shock you... but in 2004 we had computers, and high speed internet, and 3D video games! We could even use the microphones in our computers to talk to other people with microphones, across the world even! We even had websites that contained video content which we accessed via the internet!
---
inb4 "Private servers hosted in some guy's basement did it better"
---
Didn't hit 60 before P2 dropped. Slowly grinding in different zones on Kirtonos and haven't been ganked once. My 60 friends have different opinions tho.
---
I *just* made a couple of characters on Whitemane a few days ago to check in on some friends, and it immediately offered to let me transfer them to another server.  I didn't see what all the options were, but I'd assume they'll let you move to anything low/medium pop.
---
dude mc was nerfed into the ground at end of vanilla,so casuals could expirience raiding,the non shit guilds were all in aq40,the good ones in naxx
---
there will be a massive drop in bwl clears,while its easy compared to retail raiding,its still 10x times harder then nerfed MC
---
You were level 49 and got to play the game at all, and weren't constantly corpsecamped from the moment you land at the FP. That showcases how wild the imbalance is.
---
I play on a fairly balanced, slighly alliance favoured server and while ganking takes place, it's not a problem because we have the ability to fight back.
---
Are you not happy with your balanced server?
---
The people who complain like this are the same ones who watched that warrior do a bunch of dmg in pvp and asked "HOW'D HE DO THAT?" "WHAT IS RECK?!"
---
They are most definitely talking about twinking, meaning he will remain level 19 forever and only play battlegrounds.
---
We have something similar on smolderweb, some guy comes on and hosts blackjack for a few hours every day
---
You are wrong.
---
This only occurs because of the much higher population of classic wow servers compared to original WoW.
---
Camping BRM was terrible honor/hr when there were only 2-3 guilds on the enemy faction that even step foot in Molten Core. Some days you could literally camp at the MC window all day long and never see an enemy player try to zone in. So it wasn't viable.
---
Increase population 3X, and 3X as many players are doing endgame stuff thanks to it being easier with 1.12 talents and itemization, you get multiple guilds running into MC every single night. It's efficient now, because every day there are plenty of targets coming through.
---
TBH, the problem is occurring because of #SOMECHANGES. If classic was actually mechanically identical to original WoW prior to the release of BWL, things would be very different.  The great guilds would still be fine, but the more casual guilds would be struggling in MC as itemization is worse, Fury warriors literally don't even exist as a raid spec (bloodthirst was a buff, not an attack, at wow release, and it was useless for raiding), mages don't have any tasty spell hit talents or increased crit frost debuffs, 90% of the good scholo and BRD drops were actually terrible green items instead of the improved drops we see, etc. Fewer guilds would be raiding, fewer guilds would exist per server, and camping BRM wouldn't be good honor.
---
The issue is Blizzard did too little too late, eventually they did do faction specific transfers, but once there's a bunch of 80/20 balanced servers, you run into the problem you're describing.  I think there's more problems now, than would have been caused by doing faction queues/transfers from the start.
---
&gt;When do people normally make the switch over to resto?
---
Usually once they hit 60
---
&gt;And is it viable to do an ele/resto build to where I can flex dps or heal when it comes to what a group needs in the moment?
---
30/0/21 is very powerful in pvp and as dps in dungeons.  Damage isn't the problem with Elemental builds, running out of mana is and in dungeons the pulls don't really last long enough for you to run out of mana (you will be drinking after every pull though, so be prepared to send a fortune on water or befriend a mage).  It is also a viable healer in both dungeons and raids up until AQ40.  You wont be as effective of a healer in raids as deep resto, but it will still be viable.
---
I'm on the most balanced NA PvP server and no it isn't fair, it was never fair. Most of the people complaining either don't remember or didn't play PvP servers. I did, and rogues camping, hunters ganking, constant safe spotting, that was all fairly normal back in the day. Now huge PvP raids roaming or camping brm was less common but Bgs will thin that out considerably.
---
Mage
---
You don’t earn respect for no-lifing a 15 year old game.
---
Fishers wear no proper weapon, and very possibly other pieces of equipment (like helm). They are then, an easy target. Plus they might be using consumables to fish and are likely to tilt. I dont see any counterarguments?
---
On my server we have a shit ton of bots that have royally fucked up our economy, so I kill anyone farming that I see.
---
I think only melee. Only did MC once with my warrior and I am certain it was only melee.
---
I jumped into Classic about 2 weeks ago and chose AR. I have some old guild buddies who play classic, but they were never online when I jumped on so I never knew what server they played on. I have only met awesome people on the server and the guilds are pretty social and active. I am sad to say that my old buddies hit me up to join them on their server and it sucks to leave. I had to take a moment and really consider how much I wanted to play with my friends (plus leveling a druid before you get cat form suuuuuucks). 10/10 would choose AR again.
---
No, if they had their way all the servers would be dead right now...   We went from 20 player queues and multiple layers to no queues and no layers.
---
Yea... righhhttt...
---
The "tryhard" PvP he's talking about is Battlegrounds.
---
An organized group of Alliance with a couple HPals is gonna be a tough nut to crack for Horde in WSG/AB, and to a lesser extent, AV.
---
Horde have amazing small group racials, but it's a misnomer to this k they'll dominate in all PvP. Horde gonna have real problems with Full Purped out Allied Premades
---
The PvP system was a known disaster in 2005.  I couldn't understand why people weren't open to changing it.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I feel like the vanilla honor system was the worst major feature ever implemented in the entire history of WoW.  It's just terrible - every single part of it.
---
Horde player on 80:20 ratio realm confirmed
---
but are you having more fun though? I too notice that I am being overly efficient. I mean, I look online and make sure I get all relevant quests before attempting a new dungeon so I can complete them in one go. But I can't honestly say that I'm having more of a blast than the times I login just to dick around a bit doing nothing, chatting w/ a few friends, fishing, or attempting and failing to kill higher level horde around Gadget.
---
Best advice would just to be realistic about what you want to get out of playing WoW. If your main goal is to get to 60 as fast as possible and you just want to raid, the remaining 9 days of playtime / 9 weeks of playing is going to be miserable and you'll probably quit before you get 60. At your rate, you'll get there in a few months and be able to experience plenty of raid content, so just focus on enjoying the content you're experiencing now instead of rushing through it.
---
Also, a lot of people will recommend against it and think just rushing one character to 60 is the best route, but I'd recommend you try a few different classes and get a feel for which you like best. It gives you a better perspective on all the classes strengths and weaknesses, allows you to take a break if you feel stuck on your main character, and the rest system makes leveling quicker if you're playing multiple characters.
---
Are you Horde or Alliance?
---
Because it directly resolves an issue that is relevant and extremely frustrating to them on a personal level. 
---
Moving to faction-based queues basically just reverses who gets frustrated. With some extensive free server transfer options it may work, but I don't think it's an ideal solution.
---
People can shit on phasing all they want, and I get it, but it's the best solution to prevent both issues from happening when you're dealing with a dynamic server population and faction balance.
---
Taking that pretty personally, yeah? 
---
Yes, I was expecting some type of RP or something, like flavor text. Something like the fabulous GuldanRamsey recipes on Grobbulus. It is what it is, just seemed like a lost opportunity for fun. I never said I could do better, not sure why that riled you up but okay.
---
&gt; Layering killed the open world for me. But then again so did phase 2.
---
1-60 phase 1 was basically a solo and felt like low-pop server. then boom phase 2 and layers down, suddenly everyone who has nothing to do at level 60 are all on the same layer. 
---
Sad part is 1-60 early phase 1 is the best part of the game IMHO. Everyone is out there leveling and doing dungeons, makes the encounters so much better
---
Yes, because a mass exodus will only make things better, amiright?
---
All these cowards running from their problems hoping for a server that they can do the same things that were done to them which forced them to leave.  Pathetic.
---
Unless your theory is that they deliberately throw away subscription fee money because they hope those (often times 30+ old) people will start playing Candy Crush instead I don't see the relevance of this information.
---
We all know Classic is not their largest project. We also know they did their calculations and came to the conclusion it was worth their time. What exactly changed since then to make them reconsider and deliberately let their game die rather than enjoying easy money? I still don't see your point at all. Sure Blizzard would love to make even more money, but killing off Classic is literally the opposite of that.
---
dont worry that guy probably doesnt have 15$ to pay for wow sub
---
BRE is not better than oeb or spinal with weapon skill. It's a 100% PvP weapon.
---
Other people who decided to play a game about war. I honestly can’t understand how people are upset about me fighting in a game designed around fighting.
---
It will help a lot.
---
Edit: as long as theres alliance to also queue up lol.
---
Guardians of the roads unite! 
---
I really enjoy it on a druid. I'll stay near the road in cat form with track humanoids up. If it's a new person I'll pop into Taurrn form and stand on the road, using the roots and emotes to turn them back. 
---
The second time I see the same person I'll stealth and try and get right in front of them, then pop back to Tauren and repeat the process.
---
If somebody is really persistent and I've killed them once or twice I'll usually let them pass. My favourites are the ones that try to sneak past, that's when the stealth/track humanoids combo gets really fun.
---
Hundreds of kills per day?! My friends ranking are at 20k HKs already.
---
That's not why it's not welcome... It's not welcome because the internet rides the train of "the first thing said about a situation is always true and I will back it up until my last dying breath"
---
..so you get liars... All the time, or people with a warped perspective, THAT'S where all the work comes in for the mods, the constant arguing and reporting and all that garbage in the actuall subreddit
---
yeap, everyone knows that. But its like poeple want it bad.
---
Oops. Was late thanks for the correction. 
---
I did not know that! Thanks for the info
---
That's the PvP I remember- rogues and hunters stacked with engi gear just destroying helpless casuals with no sense of remorse
---
Arnoux do you have any numbers for Noggenfogger?
---
Prot obviously.
---
A hitcapped tank is a big threat tank. Can't expect your tank to wear full tier 1 and not give him any hit. 250 fire resist doesn't matter when the aggro's on the warlock.
---
Soul Link spec is so overrated on this subreddit.
---
Keep an eye out for Dragonlayd!  I would be the one dying though, not the one kicking butt, granted I'm only level 50 currently also.
---
I like turdles
---
Lots of really good gear comes from BG reputations
---
Don't answer when you have no clue about the question, mate.
---
The healers have two different shields, one for physical and one for magic.
---
This is also an artificial game theory, so I'm not sure we can learn a lot from it.
---
In the real world, with such bloodshed the minority group would be defeated and absorbed.
---
Then, internal strife would start between the "majority" and rinse and repeat you've got global politics.
---
I am lvl 57 right now and just arrived at winterspring. logged of after about 5 mobs because I was killed several times by a mob of allies ganking to the max
---
That's what I'm doing (Just got my first one last night!). Flasks aren't used as much for MC and Ony since those raids are relatively easy. BWL is more difficult, and I can see flasks being a requirement for a lot of top tier raiding guilds and even pugs. You can do MC and Ony in quest greens and blues if you know what you're doing, but BWL is not quite so easy and there's a definite stat check. 
---
I see Black lotus going from the ~50g average it is right now on Pagle to about ~100g.
---
PvE server alliance player here. Yep getting my main to exalted and then not queuing again.
---
Anecdotally most alliance players I talk to are planning on twinking instead of 60 BGs.
---
you gain something even when you lose
---
marks or rep cant remember exactly,but it was popular to "lose quickly" and afk in the AV tunnel in 2005
---
I'd say it's appropriately rated, there's a reason it's banned from dueling tournaments.
---
We continue to laugh and have fun as observed in the clip. We play for fun and have a blast doing this and also rack up a ton of honor in the process. Tuesday we got about 7K honor in just 2 hours
---
wat
---
Raids at the highest level of performance **are** mostly Warriors with a few healers sprinkled in. This is 1.12 warrior...the result of all of the talent reworks and buffs over the course of vanilla.
---
In my opinion they need to just start force moving players, merging and splitting and opening new servers and locking transfers until the population and massive balance issues are fixed.
---
It would really suck in the short term. Really bad. But I feel like this would be ripping the band-aid off and I think it's the only way to fix the issue without reimplementing some form of layering.
---
Here we go again another retail or causal player crying wanting blizzard to change the game to fit their personal taste. Roll fucking PvE dude or another PvP server where you are not minority faction. Making changes based on complaints from the people that are too damn dumb or don’t want to spend the time to find areas or places where you succeed in whatever the fuck your crying about with PVP. BGs will be out soon so you won’t have to Wpvp for honor and the big pack of gankers will massively decrease. Other please stfu and stop trying to turn classic into retail
---
I have no idea how everyone of these posts over looks this fact. Upvote from me. Population is a HUGE CHANGE.
---
There's just not a lot of feral gear in MC. You keep showing up because you like your guild and you will get more gear in later raids. Althought I do have pretty much full set of resto gear because we have a stable roster and druid gear drops a lot.
---
Server imbalance has always been a thing. Even in vanilla retail horde que times were longer.
---
Let them have in game duels for the name. Or let them fight for name order, where one will be xxx the first, and the next one xxx the second etcetera
---
Phase 1 was amazing. It had plenty of world PvP if that’s what you wanted. But you got to experience cross faction interactions that won’t ever happen after phase 2 such as helping horde with a quest or receiving help from a horde or even a /wave . There was a little trolling, like killing on the boats but it was uncommon. It was nice having interactions with the opposing faction made the world feel more alive.  I’ve had many silent agreements not to murder each other leveling because we both would level in peace.
---
The current world is impersonal. PvP isn’t even fun, it’s a grind like everything else. No objectives, just farm honor as efficiently as possible. Battlegrounds won’t change much, this is here to stay. I would love to see honor awarded only in battlegrounds but #nochanges
---
I just wish we could get better guards around flight points. chillwind camp, light hope chapel, and thorium point come to mind.
---
No, you can AoE through the magic Shield.
---
Who is defending those people camping? I dont think people should corpse camp at all. Thats my stance.
---
Can I send you all my gold and mats so you can make me more gold since you are so good at this and have a really good understanding of it.
---
And definetly arent imagining that you and others are doing more than you really think you are
---
It looks worse.  It does not look good.
---
They are, trust me. Today he used fel domination, that's demo tree.

Over 1 year ago, the \#nochanges people were screaming about how POPULATION CAP changes was the one most important change that will mess up the balance of the game. And now here we are.
---
Don't blame the nochangers for this change messing up the game! It's totally backwards and ignorant! No nochangers wanted 10k pop realms! NONE!
---
There are too many people out in the world because the population cap is like 3x more than it used to be!!! How is this not obvious to everyone yet?!?!?
---
Redbull mixed with montain dew, gotta stay wired to farm gold or I pass out its so boring lol
---
There are white and purple shields. One reflects melee and one reflects spell damage. 
---
OP to answer your question, I'm not sure because I only did the fight once so far, and I'm a shadow priest so I don't have AoE.
---
I'm still salty about how fast I got bored of classic and had to admit to myself that smarmy fucker was right (for me at least)
---
The social thing you said is so true. I remember spending SOOOOO much time in org in vanilla. I was level 40 for like 2-3 weeks, after I got my mount I was so excited I just rode around aimlessly with my friends for hours. 
---
Now it just feels like everyone’s in a race to get BiS and all. I’m seeing so many people with full T1 and 2 piece tier 2 and I legit just hit 60 last week lol
---
Not disagreeing with you, but "back in the days"? You just described every modern MMO in a nutshell.
---
Alliance.
---
Yea that all sounds like good advice. I definitely don’t want to burn myself out in a mad dash to 60. I was just worried about missing the boat on raiding. I sounds like the phase release schedule is a little more spread out than I first though though, so maybe not as much to worry about...
---
There wasn't really any collaboration - basically Blizzard announced the transfers were closing, and a few large guilds loudly said they were moving ... and then everyone else panicked and sprinted for the exits. Flamelash was already borederline unplayable so it didn't take much to start a stampede.
---
No such thing as too late :) in fact the toxic people usually leave first :)
---
I think half my guild has won and lost a epic amounts fortune from his game
---
Should report himself for clicking
---
The tough part is going to be the server lag. There's a 1500-strong guild on my server who has already said they plan to lock Alliance out of BWL for the first week (I'm not sure they realize we can just enter through UBRS . . .). But I'd guess it'll be a 400v400 lagfest in BRM for guilds trying to raid the Tuesday that BWL is released.
---
Since they're gold they look awesome. I mean, I just checked again a few minutes ago and they're still awesome.
---
In the end, blizzard was right. You think you want it, but you really dont.
---
Depends on raid.  Certain fights require more.  Garr requires a handful until enough decent gear is acquired.  In Naxx I want to say it's upward of 6 at times.  My guild made it through BWL just fine with 3 tanks.  One of which was a feral druid.
---
There really isn't many people requesting any weapon smith items right now.  People just get a purple from MC.  There are armor smith recipes that are valuable like stongholds, and lionheart, but maybe a handful of people on each server will ever get the recipe.  Axe usually has the most sought after weapons if there ever are any, so that is what most people pick.  That means there are too many axe smiths and almost zero hammer or sword smiths.  
---
All in all, unless you want to be really role play like with your dwarf, drop blacksmithing for engineering.
---
I'd be surprised if they ever activate paid transfers in any phase.
---
I’m late to the thread but I’m curious how enhancement shaman with Ironfoe/HoJ/WF would behave ... extra hits for days. Sure a warrior/rogue could recreate this with a slightly worse WF and the addition of an offhand but I’m still curious!
---
I know phase 3 is probably 2-4 months away, but I was just wondering if there's a consensus on what the best enchant for nightfall is? As an enhancement shaman, I feel like if I have a Spinal Reaper with crusader on it, I'm not going to also need crusader on nightfall because I'll be swapping between them as the buff is up. Would +weapon damage, or even a counterweight be better on nightfall? Or am I overthinking and slapping crusader on every 2H is just the way to go?
---
Let me know when youre farming these I need some honor.
---
Tell it to GUID fun with Onyxia before and Ragnaros now lol.
---
i'm a rper and hardcore pve person, like i know i'm playing a mmo...but....maybe i want to just chill by myself or with one person and just due the infinite number of quests out there while levelling, y'know?   
---
anyway when WM was introduced and bfa started, i was like, "i know i don't do pvp like ever, but i'm sure it can't be too terrible or terrifying!"   
---
\*pauses the screen and voice overs\* it was, in fact, terrible and terrifying  
---
(btw totally fine to anyone who enjoys pvp, i just turn WM off as soon as i get to higherlevel content because the chances of my babby priest getting Got every 5 minutes are too high)
---
If servers were forced 50/50 when they opened, this wouldn’t be an issue. If a server can hold 5,000, it should have stopped accepting the creation of that particular faction when it hit 2,500.
---
The issue isn’t pvp, the issue isn’t the efficient honor farming methods, the issue is the unfair advantage due to numbers. If we all play the same way, alliance or horde, then give us a level playing field. 
---
No changes is accurate of the setting wasn’t imbalanced
---
The rank points are assigned from bracket placement which is based on percentiles of the eligible player pool.  If you get 15 hks in a week, you get placed in that pool and are factored into the honor calculations.  If people are entering the pool faster than people are passing you, then your % should increase.
---
Was their name Psalms on Herod? I can't get rid of them! Even if you turn the tables and corpse camp them on your main, they are RELENTLESS and will just keep going until you give up. I wish I was half as determined with anything in life as Psalms is with camping lowbies
---
i am just fishing kinda close to the graveyard in bay of storms. everyday there is a group of 5 who leave their group temporarely to minmax honor on me and take turns killing me till all have DR. it is w/e just playing hs or watching netflix while fishing.
---
Might wanna do some research on the system. It's very unforgiving.
---
I was in college when vanilla came out and rolled a PvP server because my ex wanted to play PvP. He quit as soon as he hit 60, and I quit after all the drama in my server first raiding guild. I remember being the dominant faction and rolling over people as a 40 man raid. Honor was not even a thing back then, and this time I rolled a PvE server because I know what's what.
---
People think they want to PvP, but open world PvP is not PvP. It's just waste of time.
---
Arcanite Reaper is rather on the small side, but what we lack in numbers we make up in community. LFG can be very slow for any dungeon that isn’t BRD and beyond, but if you can get the right guild you might be able to snag a carry or two while leveling. Most zones aren’t overpopulated (the only downsides are the Horde warbands that periodically stomp Searing Gorge or the Alliance raids on Kargath every 2 hours.) I’d say if you like questing more than dungeon slam is come here!
---
If you use the /stand /sit proccing, it shouldn't take longer than 10-20 seconds to build up max Reck stacks. Were the streamers just getting auto'd?
---
Is barbershop really that bad of a change? Shit you cant even zoom in on the character creation screen so its possible to miss things.
---
Uh nah I want to play WoW, not Silent Hill.
---
I am on Sulfuron-eu, balanced server with hardcore guilds on both side. It's pretty fair. I leveled from 48 to 60 during phase 2 and it was ok. Now that I am 60 I look back and am happy to have had been forced to be creative with my leveling. And I am way more geared because I was forced to run donjons way more than questing. 
---
We have 20 vs 20 in Kargath every evening, same in the chapel and winter spring. I am just rank 2 because I was focus on leveling but I like this situation personally and am not looking forward to BGs. World pvp is great for the game imo.
---
Doesn't it make the unhappy people from alliance being a literal minority since they account for only 20% of the realm?
---
Every week you lose a % of your total rating.
---
That's why it is so hard to climb to high ranks because you are fighting against a huge amount of decay each week.
---
LOL As the griefing Horde players would constantly tell me I "went back to retail" -- broken or not, the availability of WarMode didnt look so bad after p2.
---
[This talks of the 20% weekly decay](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/honor-system-overview)
---
In a sense the #nochanges crowd isn't wrong. 
---
There were changes made that completely undermine how the game was set up... most notably phasing and server caps.  I'd argue that most of the ganking issues stem from it.
---
I was on the underdog side of a 2:1 server in Vanilla.  We still dealt with the zerg, but there was room to avoid it if you just stayed a step ahead of them.  There's just no avoiding it when the server is filled to the brim.  Ratio isn't the issue so much as the sheer increase in number of players populating an area of the same size with the same number of resources, etc.
---
No, this is flat-out silly. People were min-maxing and farming honor way back in vanilla just like today. You guys act like official forums, elitist jerks forums, youtube, and thottbot didn't exist back then. 
---
It's entirely the fault of Horde players, there is no wiggle room on that. Horde has dominated PvP for the past decade, it was no secret that they would be overpopulated.  Anyone who says otherwise is full of shit. 
---
Horde players chose Horde to dominate. They didn't want PvP, they wanted domination. If they had wanted PvP, they would have gone alliance. All the stories about "oh I just like the way undead look" are bullshit.
---
That's NATO bad idea.
---
Your entirely wrong there. If we got a true vanilla server the population on each realm would be decreased by x4. That is the reason it feels different now. #NoChanges would have worked.
---
How about alliance acting like they gonna keep the peace and fuck up your long escort quest only to have been waiting for you to get just outside of reach of finish and kill you or escort. Then guess what they come back and do it again by having an rogue follow you in stealth.
---
The other faction has a numbers advantage and griefs flight paths and inside capitals so much that people cant play the game. Doesn’t seems so ridiculous to leave when you call it what it really is.
---
Awesome, thanks for the info. Looking forward to your Alchemy 200-300 video!
---
That's an insightful comment
---
Let's be real only couple servers are owned by alliance. Horde players have no rights to complain.
---
Great video.
---
just dont play on a pvp server if you dont want to pvp.
---
the amount of crying from "pvp" players are insane.
---
No!
---
Well, /sit /stand is decent in PvE for a nice damage increase if you spend a lot of time with your healer twiddling his thumbs.
---
That's a good way to get the banhammer isn't it?
---
I don't really get how people say there is nothing to do. I've got 21 days played, and still PLENTY to do.
---
Dang, yo
---
What’s the best enchant to put on a WW. ? +7 damage or fiery? I have a Kang waiting for me at lvl 44 that is probably put +7 on
---
&gt; I've tried all three and they work, but it's a real pain in the ass getting there without a group. I feel like I'm wasting 30-40 minutes corpse walking where I could've wasted that time grinding money.
---
Don't go to town until your bags are full.  There really is not another reason to ever leave the dungeon portal if you are grinding gold.
---
To be fair we don’t have many CDs like other classes just 3 big ones sharing the same CD. 30 mins is a long time
---
I was told so many times to "go back to retail" that I finally took their advice and did ;)
---
It would've been many more hours of queue time without Layering and even less Questing/Mob availability. How fun.  
---
The current game simply doesn't encourage, restrict, or promote faction balance - it has nothing to do with how servers were handled. More people rolled Horde because Horde is simply unbalanced in favor of PvP. World PvP will eventually die out entirely again because the game never tried to keep it alive in the first place.
---
I have a hard time wrapping my head around that you can't spend 3 consecutive hours playing. Many people have voiced this issue on this sub before so I'm not trying to single you out. Now I'm not saying that it is stupid or trying to step on anyone's toes. But I'm genuinely curious on how someone can't find 3 hours on any day of the week to play consecutively. What is stopping you from having one 3h session once a week?
---
Attention mods: these are the type of posts you need to be removing if you want the sub to stop being complete trash.  The daily rant, that isn't low effort because they typed five paragraphs of nothing.
---
I "shouldve" rolled a PVE server. Everytime I see someone in the open world my reactionvis to see if they are going to attack me or ignore me, but I play hunter so basically I'm just giving them the opportunity for them to open up on me and not the other way around. I'd rather we both just fuck off and keep doing whatever we were doing. 
---
BUT the guild I found before launch had been absolutely awesome so I dont regret rolling my server at all. But fighting other players in the open world is almost never fair pvp, it's just ganking.
---
I don't camp people for honor, I do it on principle. You have to be a real dick for me to start doing it.
---
They should allow anyone to attack anyone. No sides. Guild vs guild pvp. That’s how real mmorpgs work.
---
Then remove corpse running 
---
And remove instances. Everyone goes into one molten core and can pvp inside 
---
That would actually be a good pvp mmo then. Like eve online.
---
Some servers have this issue but they have faction transfers open for the overpopulated faction to gradually fix the problem.  They just need to add faction specific server queues if it gets worse than 65/35
---
30+
---
Just for anyone in the future, you can farm these pretty easily 2-man with decent healing gear (just need a rogue or warrior and a priest). Takes around an hour in Winterspring to get one for each of you.
---
I think the chat thing is still very real, but instead of doing it in game a lot of us do it in Discord. At least, in my case, I'm part of a community that centers around a few Discord servers. We play multiple games together, and if someone quits WoW or doesn't log in for a few weeks it's not a big deal because we've been together for years already. It's not so appealing to chat in game when we're in a chat 24/7 already for the last several years, and we have a multitude of different games to play together if we get bored in one game.
---
World PvP isn't fair, that's kind of the point. Even outnumbered factions can form gank groups that dominate a zone and prevent people from doing anything there.
---
I think Skeram alliance did have a chance a couple weeks ago
---
There will still be people in the world questing, leveling, farming, running to dungeons, etc.
---
It's inappropriate language for work, just like pornography would be inappropriate images, so yeah it's kinda nsfw.

Looks like you slapped 10 instagram filters on it.
---
No reason to not have offtank(s) swinging it. Even if it only procs once, that -200 armor is a buff for every single melee/hunter hitting the boss. Also, "1 proc per minute" doesn't mean that it CAN'T proc twice in 1 minute, just that on average it procs every 60 seconds.
---
....though, don't bosses have much less armor in Classic (compared to pservers) and get reduced to 0 armor by just sunder, faerie fire and curse of reck?
---
Bigglesworth is pretty even.
---
It's not sunken cost fallacy that keeps players on PvP servers; it's Opportunity Cost. If they have to relevel a character and find a new guild and rebuild social connections and re-establish loot priority etc, etc, they are much less willing to move. A High-level, well established character now is worth much more than a high-level well established character later.
---
just play bgs and have fun,the rep,ranks and gear will be unlocked eventually
---
let the tryhards spaz out in the first 2 months,then it will be way easier to gain higher ranks
---
Is Demonshear really better than IBS for pvp though?  I mean it’s got slightly higher top end damage but the proc sucks compared to the 1% crit you get from the agility and the 20 stamina on IBS.  
---
I’m only asking because I have demonshear right now and I’m actually considering getting IBS when it comes out.
---
Well darn, that's really good to hear. My only experience with Shaman was in TBC, where shaman tanks were merely joked about. I apologize for not taking them more seriously.
---
If he is wearing the most threat gear, which is the optimal gearing strategy for mc and bwl, he can still be crit.  Good news for your well geared tank.
---
I’m sorry that you feel that way, I never said I would ruthlessly camp them or anything along those lines. I just kill enemies who are in my level range because the game rewards me for doing so. 
---
I don’t think their entire experience is ruined because I kill them one time, and if it is, I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to suggest a PvE server which is specifically designed for players like that.
---
I assume what happened is that people bought or farmed lotuses hoping that the prices will go up with P2 because hard-core honour farmers will be flasking up for wpvp as many people predicted. This didn't happen on a large enough scale for the price to increase and those people started dumping the lotuses they'd accumulated since launch which made the prices tank instead.
---
I personally think that the prices will go up again as new pve content is released and those patient enough to hold on to their lotuses until then will make a nice buck. But I'm not confident enough in that prediction to actually invest into it when I don't have large amounts of gold laying around.

Someone who plays on a PvP realm is likely more skilled at PvP than someone who plays on a PvE realm.
---
&gt; At least I find solace and satisfaction by going to those old threads, finding these #NoChanges zealots, checking their post history just to see that they are either crying about the PvP condition right now or havent posted anything since P2 hit, meaning they've probably left for good.
---
He never even considers those players might be actually playing the game.  Especially now that this forum is just not stop bitching about pvp on pvp servers and any other opinion is met with massive downvotes.
---
Good suggestion! I hadn't thought about the hyenas.
---
I can test this again with shadowbolt/curse of shadows, but I'm pretty sure the answer is no
---
Easy pickings boys
---
So they never removed layering at all!
---
You literally starting replying to me by trying to dish out insults, you don't get to try to take a higher ground here. Again, not my problem you're too stupid to understand legitimate solutions and instead just want Blizzard to make classic into a safe space for you because you suck at the game.
---
I think it's OP that doesn't get it.
---
I'm... not entirely sure what your argument is against rogues.  
---
They have a niche just like every other class in PvP?  
---
Only classes I can think of that are not niche are probably healers?
---
One of D2s many massive massive flaws is the endgame, or lack there of.  No way to farm anything in particular, nearly zero content beyond the final story boss which is piss easy etc.  God i was so bored with it
---
Good lord! 21 guilds left? Close to 1k people
---
Can I do the free transfer online or through my battlenet account? I’m not at home and my friends decided to transfer :(
---
I don’t know that, that’s true. And unlocked server transfers seemed to mostly exacerbate faction balance issues as the underpopped side ends up leaving for a server they dont get ganked 24/7 on, while the overpopped side isnt inconvenienced enough to xfer. Server transfers were not implemented at with the right time or conditions.
---
1 main tank, 1 main off tank for lack of a better term and 2 off tanks that can do dps but tank when needed ( feral druids are great here). This will change with later phases like aq and naxx though

---
Just making sure since you’ve never played before: are you training new spells?   
---
The frost bolt you have at a low level gets new ranks every few levels that cost more mana and make it hit harder.   Be sure to train those skills at a mage trainer and put them on your bar.  
---
If you’re already doing that, it does get better.  20 you get tons of new spells and further down the frost tree gets you tons of utility.
---
I'm not a particularly experienced WoW player. I've played a few different times over the years, not making it farther than level 32 or so each time. What can I say, I'm a filthy casual. I've never been all that interested in PvP in my MMORPGs. This time around I thought I'd give PvP a try. After all, a LOT of people seem to really enjoy it.
---
I'm just level 12 so far, so I haven't had a chance to participate in PvP, but the sheer amount of toxicity surrounding it in chat has really been a turn-off for me. I had always heard that world-wide PvP wasn't the gank-fest that care bears like me always envisioned - that there was generally a more gentlemanly or "honorable" approach to it more often than not. Seeing what I'm seeing, and just judging by the frequent poor character on display, I just find that hard to believe. It really makes me want to give up on this experiment and go back to a PvE realm.
---
My first 60 in vanilla was on a pvp realm. So I naturally went pvp for Classic expecting a similar experience of some frustrations, especially in STV, but generally a doable leveling experience. What I did not take into account was the x4 server size compared to vanilla. There's just too many people on the servers now which I think is ultimately the primary problem of constant roaming gank squads.
---
Are you on a RP server? Sounds fun
---
Amen brother.  Turns high paced fights into long drawn out endurance battles.  ResidentSleeper
---
Depends on a lot of things.  How long the mage gives the pet to build threat, how long the fight is, if there is a level difference in either direction, and how close the pet is to learning their new rank of growl/taunt.
---
At 60?  No chance.  Around 40, you might have some success.  If the hunter/lock put their pet on mob A while you two kill mob B, by the time mob B dies, you probably won't be able to pull threat from mob A before it dies.
---
And only to other pvp servers
---
Yes I am buying new ranks!
---
Sm/ds will make a huge difference, but dme is very punishing of small mistakes. Mara is a cakewalk
---
Been playing undead mage since 2004. I’m (not) sorry your gnome gets dunked on so hard.
---
I was exalted with WSG before 60 on my vanilla main because I loved pvp so much and did so much while leveling.  Only hit rank 11 before TBC launched because I got to the party late.
---
My dyslexia read that as Manchild and had to rewatch the clip a few times.
---
I’m a dwarf warrior and I swear the rogues are confused when I pop out of it and start pooping everywhere.
---
There was an Orc rogue bot farming ogres in Alterac. He was flagged for PvP so I would wait for him to be injured (he was lvl 41, I was lvl 36) and finish him off. 
---
Thank you for free honor buddy! 
---
I do not understand the appeal of botting. The risk is not worth the reward. Plus I mean the purpose of a game is to play it not have a program play it for you.
---
Not really absurd when it's actively happening. Alliance can't stop losing, even on more population-balanced servers. This sub is literally all day every day alliance tears.
---
Servers that had manageable populations are now so one sided because the other side got stomped, didn't transfer off and now quit cause they're big babies. If you're saying the solution is to now prevent the winning faction from even logging in, then you need to go back to retail's safe and cushy pvp. This isn't the game for you.
---
Just so you know, when you are sitting, all attacks made agaisnt you will be critical hits. Also, bind some shit.
---
That's kinda the reason i took a break too, wanted to level a new character but no one out there leveling and doing low level stuff
---
pagle isn't going to save a dozen high/full pop horde pvp realms, you could be 100% alliance for all it matters, you're still the minority by a large margin
---
Boars will be slaughtered?
---
I mean if you have something to do in that area and bubble hearth it’s a bitch thing but if your fucking around and decide it’s time to dip since there isn’t a good reason for you being in that zone I get. I see pallets bubble hearth  only to come right back to finish what they were doing just to not die is pretty pussy behavior. Tbh the spit emote should only be for mobs, the assholes that spit on other players is fucking douche and bad sportsmanship. Yes I know it’s a game but so is life.
---
They have fairly poor single target threat and very poor aoe threat.
---
It’s perfectly fine for solo leveling, but in group content they really can’t hold aggro unless everyone goes really slow on damage.
---
Warriors will most likely get overpower on rogues anyway because they have a high rate of proccing it. Evasion helps to avoid every other attacks and should be used on warrior. Not when the rogue is at 20% because it's asking for death but at the start of the fight for example, don't let that warrior build more rage.
---
Can someone explain how this is an exploit? They’re using a move as intended, taking control of a player character, and blizzard allows the buff to be removed when they attack an NPC. It’s not like the horde player is invulnerable during this time or anything like that. I understand the frustration, but I certainly don’t think it should be a bannable offense or even likened to the people who camp on rooftops as ranged dps.
---
Armoursmithing is valuable for Naxx Frost-resist gear. Just food for thought, but that's a ways out and a long reputation grind away.
---
That was my experience when my friends got me into it in 2007.
---
They were on a pvp realm, and said the real game is on pvp realms and that pve realms are for trash and losers.
---
Leveling up became a nightmare of getting constantly ganked, waiting for the ganker to get bored and leave, and then continue leveling and playing.
---
This time around I went straight to a pve realm, and it's actually good - surprised pikachu -
---
I dont randomly get ganked, I can level without having to constantly check for ganked, I dont need to leave or play an alt for 15-60 mins until a tanker gets bored. I can just hop in do some quests, group up with some locals for better questing (Paladins can be a little boring) and just go about my business.
---
I still get a burst of PTSD for a moment when I see a hordie (or an ally on my horde alts) though.
---
I mean, it still doesnt change anything?
---
Crusader is probably better, no?  Enhance doesn't have a lot of abilities that base damage on the mainhand from what I remember, so +damage is not a very good investment.
---
Counterweight may be your best option from a pure nightfall proc rate perspective.  This is assuming the proc rate isn't normalized.
---
That’s all I want is to have a character that is strong and becomes my pride and joy! I live for the glass cannon life. But just needed to see some hope. I transferred from ESO which is way different. Don’t really have any friends to play with
---
Yes, I was talking about raids. There's no 5-man content a druid can't tank.
---
As for Shaman, yes, definitely better to have a shaman tank than to have no tank at all. I suppose as a warrior tank myself I'm not well acquainted with the tank shortage, so I apologize for that. Thinking of that now, the video makes a lot more sense.

and it's perceived that you "screw" someone over. you only "screw" someone over if you're try harding to min/max an obnoxious amount and it's assumed that a specific debuff slot was "someone elses" to begin with.
---
It's funny because all of the private servers with like 6k people online were considered WAY too overpacked, and tons of people complained that the population had a huge effect on the economy. Then you look at the current state of Classic, and those 6k concurrent pop servers look empty.
---
Exactly. #nochanges would've been fine if there were really no changes. Instead Blizz decided to abuse layering and stuff server full of people because they weren't sure of the success of Classic and afraid of dead servers. 
---
I really don't get the logic of people like /u/RollingGolding, we ended up with shit like BfA because of the changes of Blizzard - and now he wants them to release Classic while they are allowed to make changes? Because hey, maybe they get it right the second time, eh? Well, they didn't...
---
Valor chest isn't a huge upgrade versus several other attainable ones. Plus you can farm a savage chain much faster with arena spams
---
incendius - pvp is fairly balanced in most areas except of course thorium point.
---
it can be highly enjoyable if you get a group of 4-5.
---
Never.
---
If only Blizz listened...  
---
It is kind of funny looking back at those and seeing how true it is now lol
---
Neither of those work on a warrior
---
Still is.  The most efficient way to farm honor is sit in BGs all day.  Not that I like that, world pvp is way more entertaining than wsg or AV.
---
Nothing's changed.
---
No, I just tend to disagree and think that they are balanced.
---
Balance to me doesn't mean "all talent tree branches are equally viable and the class can perform at a high level regardless of spec". 
---
It means that the class is viable any way you choose to play it, which I feel paladin has right now, in part due to the ease of content and in part due to 15 years of tactical development for the class. 
---
Mostly I think the players that focus on numbers and meters instead of fun are the problem. Especially in a mostly solved game. If that makes me delusional then so be it.. I don't want paladins to be great healers, great tanks, and great DPS. Great, good, mediocre is perfect.
---
Lol. AQ-opening is easily solved really. You can funnel mats thru AH. Wont take any longer than having VENTURE adding their mats.
---
Alliance certainly aren’t losing on my server, they routinely camp DM and BRM, I do not think alliance come out and whine about servers that are balanced
---
You really don't need a new weapon everytime a minor upgrade becomes available. I think I used lord Alexander's axe (15g) from 51 to 60 and bonebiter before that. Just look for whatever has the highest top end damage for fat mortal strikes, whirlwinds, and overpowers!
---
There's no way, they dont yield honor or xp.
---
Imagine not being a Tauren and farming these. Worst time of my life.
---
Play a Warrior to 60, go do some PvP and you tell me man. It's not as simple as that. Recklessness isn't an "I win" button. You have to actually generate rage, stay alive, and manage your enemies in order to pull that off which is why the video uploader didnt immediately murder the enemies at the start of the video.
---
this is for my guild runs we’re coordinated but people kept saying not to AoE mana shields which seemed incorrect to me
---
I mean tbh that's not really bustling, but I'm glad EF has gained some population. My gripe was always the bare auction houses and difficulty of finding groups.
---
This is what I do but I also have all my relevant pet actions macros to the same button. You can add "pet:felhunter" as a condition like you can "mod:shift", so I've got void sac, succubus mouse over and target seduction, mouse over and target spell lock, and mouse over and target devour magic on the same macro.
---
yes! that's more like it!
---
You're absolutely right about people wanting more to do. WoW came out over a decade ago and since then we've had years of cellphone games and meme culture to teach instant gratification and shorten attention spans. I could go on about how this I can be seen in other areas of society, but it is interesting seeing it take place in Classic.
---
word ty
---
They is some serious pain.
---
5 years ago I'd say "and you'll be better off with BF". 
---
How times have fkin changed.
---
I actually miss flying mounts from the Burning Crusade because you could essentially decide if you wanted to participate in world pvp, rather than be corpse camped every 5 feet losing the chance to do BRD because you cant get inside. You could just fly into instances and fly away from shit hitting the fan. Some people hated it but it definitely made it more enjoyable to play for me. I'm probably going to stop with Classic until/if the insane spawn camping and killing everything in sight at all times slows down. I'm hoping BG's helps aid in that scenario because I was having a lot of fun.
---
Yea players that run around using the spit emote on players is bad sportsmanship and clear sign that the person is a fucking bitch loser in real life. Having been in real sports where a player have spit on a team mate it boils me blood when I see other horde do it to ally on my server.
---
I quit too but for the opposite reasons. I was horde and alliance outnumbered us by about 30%. And although we were on a pvp server, horde had absolutely no interest in helping stop ganks, so alliance basically owned Crossroads, Gadgetzan, and Un Goro, and literally nobody tried to stop them
---
Yeah, this is my experience. I'm not huge on PvP in general but I rolled on a PvP server. Phase 1 was legitimately fun, there were frustrating times but for the most part if I died in PvP it truly was "PvP happened." Now there's no chance of me defending myself I'm playing other games until BGs release
---
So, we must have different definitions of fun, but I'll grant, it is subjective. I just did not see a lot of tools in the Shaman's toolkit that seemed to make for an engaging tank experience. But to each their own. Do forgive me for discouraging those passionate about shaman tanking!
---
Bloodvine is raid gathered, how will you stockpile it?
---
"n0 cHanGes"
---
I don't think people realize how shitty classic actually is. BC was better by far, except for maybe removing 40 man raids and a few other things. Unfortunately retail might be worse.
---
The "legitimate solutions" you're referring to very clearly have not worked.  You blame the users, I blame Blizzard.
---
This.  3 hit on 1 item is huge.

Friend got the mh but cannot get the oh

Don't leave Biggles! We need you :(

(I am alliance btw. I know getting to BRD sucks but Ally has been fighting back more and more this week, and BGs will help out)
---
This is the best answer, just want to add that  [Sentinel's Blade](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19549) /  [Scout's Blade](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=19545) are great alternatives for Vendetta. In my experience a fast OH is a luxury. I usually dont have trouble proccing my poisons.
---
Ironforge.pro suggests ~65% horde.
---
Agreed. Character names and merges are minor issues compared to the shitshow that we got.
---
Voidwalker wont hold anything. Not even only wanding 😂
---
That’s cool man, didn’t really ask for your monologue about what you think is wrong with the game but

Is there some sort of user guide you've encountered out there to help use some of these features? The addon is so not intuitive I haven't figured out a thing about it.
---
Bro I don’t know wtf you’re going on about with this half assed “horde races suck” insult lmao I hate dwarves and all dwarves are KoS. Night elves are next in line
---
Not all of the materials. Look at all that mooncloth required, think about how many casters are going to want it, use bullshit math and say 'mooncloth prices will be through the roof in phase 4!!!1!" Ditto Ironweb silk.
---
I'm sure "a company" can do that, but I'm also pretty sure Blizzard specifically cannot do that.
---
The problem is for us horde on PVE servers who will have to absorb those idiots and ruin our queue times for BG's
---
Nomu - undead priest.  He's pretty geared (Benediction, multiple T1 pieces, couple epic off pieces) which is why I think people keep falling for it.
---
Human warrior and rogue are the go-to for PVE.  Racials aren't that important for raiding.  More for hardcore pvp.  The rep bonus on humans is good for any class.
---
Sorry but when I was on a horde heavy realm horde had the boats for 11 hours on a Saturday and would and I got killed 14 times (0 honor for 9 deaths) and the rest of the time was spent mind controlling low level players into the middle of the ocean. How is this getting honor ?

---
When will mighty rage potions be used frequently? PvP? Raiding? What scenario or boss thank you!
---
Meh, free server transfers for everyone was a fucking horrible decision. Bliz shot themselves in the foot and ruined thousands of people’s hard work/relatively decent classic experience. What in God’s name was the reason to give everyone a free transfer? I can’t possibly think of any positives that would outweigh the fuck fest it created.
---
I mean, there really didn't have to be any "changes", Blizzard just should have had the honor system and BGs in the game for the start like all Vanilla private servers did. This shit was never an issue on any of them. Even the pserver elitist "no changes" crowd could have told you this was a bad idea. I think it was the retail "no changes" crowd that had absolutely no idea what they were talking about that advocated for delaying the honor system and BG releases.
---
Not getting into a raid as a Ret pally

Even still, some of them are rough to see in the clutter.

U fell for a scam so now ur guildies gotta be broke with ya ? Lol...

I like that they are polite.. but no need for the handouts. Instead, warn ur guildies of this scammer and go farm ur gold back.

Don't make ur guildies replace every thing u lose in game.

&gt; meme build to oneshot non-twinkers
---
Which, just my personal opinion, is the absolute best (most fun) way to play rogue twink. Explode anyone wearing cloth or leather on the back lines and move on to the next one, sap anyone wearing plate, and only join brawls you know your side will win.
---
Nice advise expect for the fact that he IS 60 ALREADY you dumb fuck retail gnome
---
I never understood why people put so much weight on these statistics which are wildly inaccurate
---
&gt; But why wouldn't I try to optimize if I can?
---
Because you can't. Taking 10 minutes longer in a dungeon is better than waiting a 1/2 hour for a warrior. Wasn't that the whole driving factor for this content?
---
That's basically all they said. Didn't address the fact that thousands can't even play the game. Hopefully some of the campers realize that their honor is actually correct and they aren't going to magically obtain rank 10+ and will stop camping as much.
---
You will fight mainly other twinks. Hunter / warriors / rogues are very strong at that level. Consider going riposte, its insanely good vs twinks.
---
Reddit is full of alliance it seems
---
I did end up transferring.  I had to remote into my home computer from work to do the transfer and it said it would take a few minutes.  I couldn't wait for it to finalize.  I'll send you a message once my character transfers and I confirm I don't have to change my dude's name.  Thank you a whole lot.
---
12 for warlocks on my current sim.  Why would it be worth so much less on a mage?  With ice shards you get the same crit bonus as Ruin.
---
lol, it's not a problem.  I transferred to this server the weekend it was born, and even then there were no problems - and we've grown by leaps and bounds since then.
---
The server is Alliance-dominated right now, and you can basically AFK in Blackrock Mountain without fear.  You know all the complaints you hear about Horde:Alliance imbalance everywhere else in Classic WoW?  It's basically flipped on Earthfury.
---
FWIW, there's at least 12 Alliance guilds that are fully clearing MC every week.  It may be north of 15 now.  There's MC and Onyxia PUGs going most popular raid nights too.
---
You dont get it. Not everything is about min maxing.
---
Make an effort to join groups, join a guild.  It's easier - especially for cloth wearers - to work with others. And any group will appreciate a good mage.  Mage is my favorite class and I am unapologetically in love with each and every one my mages.
---
Ouch! That hurts all the pallies out there!
---
How do you have 40 days played already
---
Wasn't it in response to the dude that one shot a world boss with it? Like he spent ages stacking it and then just one hit one kill a world boss
---
Competitor MMO, I'd rather not be specific.
---
We all played classic as kids or young adults
---
Technically witch hunting
---
Lack of XP in the BGs is what makes twinking possible.
---
These are facts lol
---
Maybe you shouldnt have been busy fingering your asshole when you created that hideous turd of an undead. I can bang my undead priest I made her hair look like she just went to get that shit done.
---
It's alright to put Value on WoW.  But the sacrifices necessary for GM/HW is just insane on the scale.
---
IMO no game is worth sacrificing your career, relationships, or health for.  In fact, you shouldn't sacrifice any of those 3 things for anything, even the others.
---
On pservers BGs were released from the start along with the honor system. Players still camped flight points and every high level zone in between queue times. Nothing will change with BGs except there will be even less alliance out in the world fighting off the horde.
---
The only three EU PVP servers worth playing on are Mograine, Ashbringer and Zandalar Tribe.
---
Sorry but it's the truth. All others, enjoy your crazy imbalance.
---
If someone is doing something they know is against the rules, they should stop. Doesn't really matter what we think of the rules.
---
I have to say I also don't understand how your experience was like this. I leveled to 60 on stalagg (one of the first servers to be announced) in I think 5-6 weeks and like u/girlywish said I was competing for quest spawns the whole way. Always had a ton of people around to play with. You may have leveled so fast that &gt;90% of the server was still online but below you in level
---
For better or worse I would say modern MMOs (though there really aren't "modern" MMOs these days as most of the popular ones are relatively old at this point) and online multiplayer games are less focused on time sinks (though obviously that is still a factor) but more focused on money sinks. The goal is to extract more money from each player specifically rather than indirectly by keeping them paying for a subscription longer.
---
Lol probably. I don't think I'd count a mob attacking me as 1v2 tho lol
---
Red is dead.
---
Yeah you have no idea how it works. If a who returns the same players it refines the search until it doesn't get the same players. It also doesn't do it by zone it does it by race, class and then name. So Human Warlocks Aa-ab, Human Warlocks Ab-Ac, etc.
---
It is unreasonable that I should have to change the way I have had my game set up just to play the same way I did a month ago when the game actually worked properly
---
If that's the case then it doesn't make sense for there to be faction barriers around speech, trade, and grouping. The opposite faction on a PvE server are just players you aren't allowed to interact with with, which makes PvE servers just feel weird. Maybe PvE servers should remove all those player interaction barriers as well. Serious suggestion. You could still do "PvP events" and stuff, with friendly interaction turned off while you're flagged. Maybe a bit odd, but not as odd as having lots of uninteractable opposite faction players around in the world. Can't fight them, can't talk to them, can't trade with them, can't group with them - they're just visual objects around you, basically.
---
Soooooo glad we rolled PvE this time. I paid my PvP dues back in the day; I just want to be able to get shit done since I have much less time to play than I did 10 years ago before kids and house upkeep.
---
My guild has just started working on Rag, and we're pugging Ony due to attunements so this whole "there's nothing to do" isn't at all our experience.
---
In has to do with server over population.

sorry, I misspoke. I don't mean fair as in like "/e asks %t if they want to duel" 
---
I mean a balanced-ish h/a ratio, being able to quest at a low level without getting swarmed by 60s immediately, or in general you have a good time and don't have to stop playing because of getting ganked over and over.
---
why did you say "have a nice day"? thats such a weird and random thing to say in this situation
---
Once they realize that they're playing the same amount but not gaining any rank, people will start being upset for real.
---
They are all pvp
---
Well clearly you aren't good enough for classic, so you really should go back to retail. It'll help with your feelings of inferiority. 
---
I want as close to a vanilla experience as we can get. Idc if that makes me a shill, I'm still gonna tell the giant babies like yourself to fuck off when you ask for ridiculously stupid ideas like faction queues because you're too trash to play the game as is. If Blizzard listens to you filthy casuals, Classic will be ruined too.
---
So go back to your safespace where you might actually be able to beat someone in pvp so you can finally have one thing in your life to be happy about.
---
Are we all just going to ignore the couple good years that were Myspace?
---
bg's just like in vanilla will become the norm -  .... i mean MAYBE for some... maybe rogues(Doubt it)... it still may be efficient to Solo gank players........... BUT with most "targets" going to the BGs for honor.... the stealthers/easier solo pvp players... will go where the bulk goes.. into BG's
---
80 kills an hour in the BRM zergs is about 5-10 honor at best a kill... thats 800 honor an hour if they are ALL 10's ... and thats spent standing around hitting 1-2 keys ... AND thats if that many of the opposing faction are coming in those amounts.... you could spend 30 minutes with NOTHING  - its open world.. its not always the same
---
1 wsg win can net if i recall... 140 for the win..... + all the kill honor you get from the 10 man, which will net 30-40 a kill depending
---
a WSG can be won... at its fastest within 6 minutes i believe? 
---
so if you manage 6-7 wins an hour(Which isnt difficult for a grinding team - i remember pulling at our best 11-13 wins an hour if we simply phased PUG groups with our premade... ) thats 980 honor NOT INCLUDING the gains honor kills OR including the MARKS OF HONOR you get from winning (3) or losing (1) ... which can also be turned in for another batch of honor
---
BUUUUT this will cause a NEW complaint to arise
---
that of "Premade vs Pug... isnt fair"
---
&gt; What the fuck is a hardcore kickball player? 
---
A person in a kickball league.  Because the other 99.99% of people that play kickball will never be in a kickball league.
---
WE
---
You mean you have the 3 hit scope? Doesn't help with melee hit last i heard
---
There are more players in orgrimmar for ony buff on tuesdays than the entire population of nost. The mega servers have 2-3x what pservers had.
---
His comment was specifically saying that he quit because no BGs.  Not that the lack of BGs destroyed server populations.  Whether that was his intention or not, it was not explicitly said.
---
Guards won't reach then from agro range alone. That's the difference. 
---
I've seen guards go up there when someone brought one back.
---
I should have mentioned I’m on the east coast, whoops!
---
I think you should still prioritize MS over OS, otherwise you penalize the players showing up in a spec benefiting the raid over someone showing up in a spec benefiting themselves yoinking an item for offspec.
---
dude this a MMORPG fi blizz have restricted the char creation that would be the most stupid thing to do
---
You ever heard the phrase "there is no cure for being a cunt"? I think it applies to him.
---
You asking for some hot soup?
---
Do the rules explicitly state that you can’t use your MC ability to remove the debuff? I genuinely don’t know the answer.
---
You can always find your lockouts by going to the raid tab in the social panel (default keybind "O") and clicking the "raid info" button in the upper right corner of that window.
---
should be fine, check /raidinfo
---
I’m ally on Sulfuras and it may be balanced but way more horde pvp and horde always control BRM
---
Big up Zandalar! Woot woot!
---
Runescape players ended up with shit like RS3 because of decisions Jagex made.
---
Runescape players also trusted Jagex to make changes to Oldschool Runescape, and look where that got them. It got them to an extremely successful and well respected Oldschool MMORPG. Your argument is fucking dumb.
---
Damn. Our last kill was 79 seconds, but that was without melee dps until the last, like, 10%. I did some rough napkin math, and if we kept melee in the whole time, we'd get it down to 49 seconds. If we got everyone world buffed? \*whistles\*
---
But even then, not sure if we could get em in 22 seconds. Well done.
---
 /raidinfo in game or go to your raid tab and look in the top right for the "Raid Info" button.  If it's greyed out, it means you are not locked to any raids.  If it lists an MC ID, you are locked to that raid.
---
Trash shouldnt lock you, but it has been a bug that's been around forever where sometimes just zoning in will lock you to that MC.
---
Bet you thought that sounded clever when you hit reply huh?
---
Do ppl actually enjoy raids every week doing the same thing, or do they do it for the loots?
---
I leveled fine without the extra gold dump. Personally I think you’re better off saving the gold and using dungeon weapons you get.  Just my 2 cents!
---
I'm Alliance on Heartseeker. I get jumped by groups of Horde pretty much anywhere I go. 20 man raid on the Menethil boat. 10 man raid running around the entrance of DM. 40 man raids sitting in BRD. Horde may be outnumbered, but the server isn't unplayable like it is for Alliance on Skeram.
---
I did lbrs at 56 and it was fine, but I have +440.  But lbrs was easy, and it's really good XP.
---
At 58 anything except ubrs and maybe ud strat should be fine.
---
At least for rend, its fine if your dps is good, not a lot of it is very difficult healing.
---
Horde will funnel mats to ally players through neutral auction house.
---
I'M OUTRAGED!
---
so I just stare at the stain on the wall 
---
where
---
Is there a blue post somewhere with blizzard saying they were gonna work to improve faction balance where the #nochances crowd objected? I don't remember seeing anything like this from blizzard, so I'm not sure how you came to this conclusion.
---
Fix? Make everything perfect you mean, or would you like to define that? 
---
It will certainly help, if you think gangs of 40+ Will still be clashing from Brm to Thorium point then you're delusional, travelling as 5 when you go to Dungeon will probably be huge, rather than futile as it is currently when you're just a bigger target.
---
It does not give you a global cd
---
To actually help you out, there's a spec that enables you to be 80% effective in both Prot &amp; Fury.

---
1. Equip a shield when off-tanking or running dungeons
---
1. Grab another weapon when DPS
---
People just have this grand idea that they will be able to be super tight BFFs with a great loving guild and everyone will travel to each others weddings and they'll have a meet up BBQ once per year etc like you see sometimes brought up in this sub.
---
The reality is, these guilds are rare and they take a long time and many hours played together to gel so strongly like that. Also you have to get lucky and run into cool ass people.
---
People hear those stories on here and get upset when everyone in their guild isn't instant best friends that do everything together in game. They want to find that community. They probably don't have a lot of close friends irl. They are trying to force the tight bond that needs wipes and trials and tribulations to be formed in reality.
---
They'll switch guilds and realize it's the same everywhere
---
Active, there's both tryhards and carebears, outnumbered but holding it's own. That's how I would describe it.
---
Dude didn't even have battleshout up.  Missing a bunch of AP to boot.  lol
---
What would be the best content for a paladin and a mage to do for gold? We have herb and enchanting. I don't think we can realistically two man dm jump runs but I was thinking maybe mauradin for elemental Earth and ghost mushrooms.
---
Oof. That seems...punitive?
---
Yes because no bugs or oversights ever exist in video games. Its all intentional and fixing literally anything in a game is a 10 minute job.
---
Yes.  Absolutely yes.  To your entire raid, even if they are not near.
---
Its not zacharias tho
---
My guild has 1 main, 3 secondary, and 2 off tanks dpsing unless one of the secondaries fall.
---
It's not like retail, people will be raiding mc and ony for a very long time. At this point, it will be more difficult to find dungeon groups as you level because most people are focusing on raiding. But once you reach 60, you won't ever have trouble finding groups for endgame content.
---
big true
---
Thats not true. Elemental Sharpening Stone increases overall crit. We aren't on private servers anymore. Get your shit together. 
---
Now you are trying to nitpick the meaning of BiS.
---
The best overall combination of items for an Orc DPS in this phase includes Aged Core Leather Gloves, Deathbringer, and Corehound Tooth. Facts.
---
I know what Flurry Axe does. You don't know what crit stone does. And you don't know what items are BiS, thats for sure.
---
I like it!
---
So wait, #nochanges ask Blizzard not to change anything, and blizzard makes a bunch of changes like increasing the population cap by 2-3x. Then people who are mad that they're being camped by people 24/7 get mad at #nochanges people instead of Blizzard?
---
Blizzdrones are unbelievable.
---
make sure you drag them to your action bar since the game doesn't do it for you.
---
Maybe, but jerks will be jerks whether it's in BGs or open world. PvE has 'em too, but PvP just seems to breed them.
---
Like what?
---
How many hours will people spend raiding MC, BWL and AQ40? I would argue its somewhat close to time it takes to get R14.
---
You don't have to nolife the entire time either. You can play in moderation until you get to rank 10 or so.
---
Yeah can confirm that this is probably the case. I leveled alliance whitemane and was 30-40 after 3 days so was well ahead of the curve and had no issues questing through it. Not to mention everyone and their mother was in ZF before it was fixed.
---
I'm enjoying it currently.  Every week I try to show up with better gear, more consumes and improve on my performance from the previous week.  It's also pretty quick, we do MC + Ony in 2.5 hrs, so that certainly helps without feeling frustrated or bored.
---
Nah dude - rank 10 is an absolute joke even when compared to rank 11. It falls off HARD, and when people say "casually" for rank 10, they're still talking about 10-20 hours a week minimum. We don't even know yet - that was in 2004 when way fewer people were min/maxing like they do now. On the higher pop servers/factions it could end up being a crazy grind just to get rank 10. The guys I knew who got rank 14 in vanilla were literally playing 110+ hours a week for 2-3 months on end, and that was on a tiny (relative to classic servers) medium pop server at the time. It's not something to even worry about if you've actually got a job, let alone a family or other relationships to worry about.
---
Golemagg-EU is also ok for alliance. Horde outnumbers the alliance, but the alliance has more HC guilds. Wpvp is back and forth depending on the players involved (speaking as a non crybaby ally player)
---
uh yikes sweaty is that a problematic dog whistle?  lots to unpack here
---
[what are you talking about?](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) it only depends on the time of day. Sometimes alliance are in control sometimes horde are in control.
---
Your 2 cents are REALLY appreciated! Thank you for responding!
---
Dude trying to sound like horde is bad when it doesn't matter at all horde or alliance, some people are jerks it's true
---
I agree, I came from blaumeux with &lt;Indecision&gt; and I have been loving our new home. Pvp consists of a skirmishes and 1 to 1 battles. Me and a few Horde from &lt;Invite Only&gt; battle all day over nodes its pretty fun its usually 1 v 1. Sometimes we avoid each other. Ocassional larger battle of 15-15 at Kargath or BRM. Then there is WU the horde rogue who lives 14 hours a day at the boats having a reputation as the worst 1 v 1 rogue on horde but also probably has the most fame and honor ranking. Raids are fun, getting to dungeons are great. At the start there was no horde but now they are in a good healthy population too. Economy has picked up, dungeons are super easy to find. I think Envy has one of the fastest Mc/Ony kills in the world. It has been great. This is the classic I remembered.
---
Why do you think joining a guild makes you a slave to helping out a bunch of people? The raid logger guy isn't expecting anyone to help *them* with stuff, it's not like they are being unfair in the relationship.
---
People are in guilds for a lot of different reasons. You don't have to be best friends or die on the sword for your guild if that's not what you want and it's not what the guild expects
---
what a stupid comparison it's not even close.. a counter strike match is exactly what battlegrounds are. your upvotes speaks wonders of the state of this community, you guys are the ones ruining classic. I'm ally on 3rd most imbalanced server and p2 has been the best wow I've ever had
---
I have all but 3 slots filled with epic gear, I'm not abandoning my main. I would pay $50 in a heartbeat to move to a PvE server so I can actually play the game outside of raid.
---
All this bipartisan bullshit but were all taking about the same government.
---
Blizzard is being blamed because of the max players on each realm. Ita significantly higher numbers compared to classic. Just wanted to pass that info along.
---
I would argue people cared more about R14 titles than they do about arena titles.
---
Arena interest is at an all time low.
---
Yeah, I'm calling bullshit here.  There's no getting 100-0 in 5 seconds by a rogue if you have Soul Link and the -10% physical damage taken if you have a Voidwalker out unless you have absolutely no Stamina whatsoever on your gear.
---
FTR good locks destroy mages, it's not even a close matchup.
---
I enjoy it. I love being in a group with 39 other people with a common goal. But it's also definitely for gear.
---
Am I crazy, or does Mik not exist for classic? Tried to install it but it wen to my retail folder, and when I search only in the classic wow addons Mik does't exist.
---
Loved Mik, but using standard combat text from the built in because I can't seem to find it at all for classic. Let me know if I'm wrong.
---
For reference, I'm using Twitch for my addons
---
They are dogshit, voidwalker is mostly as an off-tank, and the AoE taunt is also really strong.
---
But for single-target, now way. One shadowbolt and it no longer has aggro, but if you just dot and wand (without immolat) it does alright.
---
Hunters pets are slightly more valuable because hunters can feign death, and reset aggro.
---
Idk why people are surprised by this sentiment.  People bitch in every single game release if they don't have some pointless rank or badge grind because they complain there is nothing to do if that isn't there.  As if grinding for a new badge or rank next to your name is actually something worth working for.  Gamers have turned gaming into a job for nearly every game there is, not the companies.  Gamers bitch if they don't have something obscure to strive for and act like those who don't strive for it are casual.  Any of us who look objectively at the gaming culture and its evolution over the last 20 years can see it plain as day.  Gaming culture has gravitated more towards  pointless carrot partially under the guise of ranked gameplay anxiety.  Look at the way ARPGs like Diablo and PoE have evolved.  I have discussions with my friends about  how they feel they aren't playing the game to the fullest if they aren't grinding high level Maps or GR's and ridiculous speeds, no matter the kind of experience that creates for those around them.  If you aren't grinding high GRs at a pace of 3 minutes or less you might as well not play the game.  I don't get it, slow the hell down and run in it 4 minutes, you'll be just fine dude.  This shit isn't a job.
---
Thanks for sharing your feedback here.
---
I can't say that I entirely get it, but it's great to see someone articulate it in an academically honest way that is worthy of thinking about.
---
Yea! Rotate with other members of your faction. Maybe camp them for 3 or 4 kills then call a friend to do it in your place. So on and so forth.
---
(btw they're in a guild because they raid together)
---
That data was posted two months before the honor system release.
---
It's a couple things.
---
The mechanics of the raid aren't really "fun" after the umteenth time; but achieving victory with 39 other people makes you feel like you've put together a proper team.
---
Trying to beat previous performance on a personal level, and trying to beat fight times on a guild level is constantly rewarding and gives you a clear path of progress. Each time a dedicated raid member gets an upgrade you feel as though the guild just got that much better and is increasingly prepared for more rigorous content.
---
Then of course there's the excitement of BoE's and other loot, our raid 1 team landed a binding the other night, everyone erupted.
---
Does that apply in BG's? The after 5 kill thing?
---
Gross. And I thought our estimated 80/20 horde/alliance here on Skeram was bad. At least it's not 94%! Blizzard temporarily allowed only Horde to leave, but that was after giving final Alliance guilds the chance to go, first. And some did.
---
The 5 stack limit was a nerf from what it could do in early vanilla. This move holds the distinction of being nerfed for one shotting a world boss...
---
I don’t mind letting rogues have locked chests that are in dungeons. However rogues have been rolling need on lockboxes and that shit needs to stop. Nothing entitles a rogue to a lockbox more than any other class.
---
Zandalar Tribe is about 55 (A)/45 (H). It feels pretty good on Horde. Sometimes we dominate, sometimes we get rolled, it really depends on how organized people are. Absolutely no complaints.
---
Why not? It takes like 15 minutes to finish a census. So yeah if in this 15 minutes some undead rogue logs in and the addon already checked for undead rogue then it won't count yeah. However I believe that is very small percentage of error. Also by that logic alliance players can log in as well, so both sides will have probably less than 50 people who are not counted.
---
I see ur point really. But from playing on a pve realm and being bias somehwytm ill tell u, it's the unknown factor that we do like. As a horde in tanaris. I'll see an ally. Doing whatever. Maybe we mess with each other like taking mobs or nodes or maybe we help each other seeing one get overrun and we come to their aid. Anything could and does happen. 
---
The amount of times and places that u are flagged and run into one who isn't and the exact vice versa happen AL too often and that creates random skirmishes too. It's a wild factor of super unknowing. 
---
You never know what's gonna happen with the enemy faction where as on a pvp one you're either gonna be swarmed by a kill squad, out lvled and killed, or jist run into a full on war and be corpse stalked. 
---
I think pvp realms should have been fewer in number than the pve ones so that the ones who really really wanna live that pvp life can and do so with the other nest if the nest. And not have tony pops.
---
Make more servers
---
No. This game literally has **War** in the name. 
---
You want peaceful happy fishing watery boi time go play fishing simulator. 
---
If you are on a pvp you should expect to be Killed on sight every time, every level, every zone. 
---
Unless the player /waves at you.  (Universal suhh dude im chillin emote) 
---
If you want a chance at fair world pvp your only option is to /bow and then instantly right click the person you want to engage(makes your character go into an im ready lets fight stance) signifying that would want to engage in combat.
---
Yeah, it's all a matter of if you want to wait for your tanks to get 4 piece tier 3 before doing the fight or not. It was a huge roadblock back in the day, for obvious reasons.
---
To be fair, that's a standard raid comp. 8-10 warriors, 6 mages/rogues, 4 pallies/shamans/priests/locks, 3 hunters, 2 druids. 3-5 flex spots.
---
I am not entirely sure what other recipes are added, but I know can also craft some shadow resist gear when AQ comes out, and you can also get the rare recipes to earn profits.
---
Of course. Those are two separate things imo. 
---
Anyone who needs on a lockbox is an asshole.
---
Life is good on my RP-PvE realm.  No I don’t RP.
---
 :)
---
Someone posted this awhile back:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yut0z4UHOa1X5wN41a0aNjFDFPDk4dM8cuy5Oeoyuzc/htmlview#gid=749847074
---
? I don't understand your problem
---
Wow. awesome story. Kudos.
---
My ideas here are literally off the dome and not perfected even a little. But I feel like so many ppl who would love this game are stuck in their pvp realms and are struggling to get out before they just quit and that's a shame
---
i like to have my char rp walk on mount, like the npcs in teld do. Looks legit intimidating from their perspective
---
man i think it would be even more fun if i also had a shadowmelded sentinel RPer about 50 yards behind, executing once those who didnt heed my warning
---
Generally it’s been allowed to move from PvP to PvE but not the other way around. In this case I’d assume the selection of destination servers is probably based on population.
---
Yeah, but I would argue dailies/weeklies tend to be less of an actual timesink overall than just pure, grindy content that doesn't have a clear "reset" mechanic built in.
---
I firmly feel, from an efficiency standpoint, BGs won’t stop this way of grinding, especially with diminishing returns in a 10v10 battleground. Constant flow of new meat on the way to BRM ;)
---
The current world record MC speedrun includes a balance druid.
---
Yeah he walked up to Lord Kazzak and oneshot him pretty much
---
You first replied to my comment implying that I was dumb and wrong about everything and giving no solution.  And pretty much every comment after that has been a similarly smug remark with name calling and comments about how terrible my life is, etc. Good luck treating people that way, praying for you.
---
Sounds like a fuckin terrible idea.
---
Things will get easier with time though. 
---
6 months from now, the ultra-no lifers will have gotten R14 and have dropped down. Semi no-lifers will have burnt out.
---
You can aoe them safely. My guild gathers them all and goes bonkers on aoe, making sure to kick heals. With ranged/healers at a safe distance, basically only melee take any significant damage
---
So long as everyone remembers their douses!
---
We miscounted on Tuesday, we simply weren't going to wait \~25 minutes for someone to run to Azshara when we have Thursday planned for cleanup anyways.
---
So far the only good advice posted, respec to the popular fury/prot build.
---
Deep prot is unnecessary even if you are the guilds "main tank"
---
I’m not gatekeeping anything, but I’m certainly not gonna upvote sob stories about how hard it is for poor horde to get good honor returns without camping a capital city.
---
Considering the alliance can't transfer away but horde can, it might be the same or with some luck even better.
---
You decry #NoChanges zealots, but I don't see how mild changes would be able to fix this. The modern optimizing mentality of players is the biggest cause of the current PVP situation.
---
I can sense the butthurt from here.
---
Server populations may change but "full" "medium" and "low" are just labels that represent the current population of the server. I think you're misunderstanding that distinction.
---
The best use I have found for them is to help me get an early threat lead when I'm tanking for groups that don't like to wait before DPSing. 50 rage is plenty to use shield slam, sunder and revenge, which means I probably won't be losing aggro early. (I generally use the cheaper ones though)
---
&gt;you should thank the #NoChanges morons for this entire mess.
---
no ur a moron
---
Do you really think things weren't exactly this way in 2005? Because they were.
---
Thanks. That makes sense and appreciate the heads-up about the bug.
---
So I didn't read your book you typed but I did read your question. As a healer I have learned over the years that healing is situational.  Knowing what your heals do and the amount of healing they do will is the key. After you've learned this, your brain will take over. So IMO prioritizing and or situational,  you will learn this over time. 
---
Sorry if this doesn't help, I started healing on my 1st toon and asked all types of questions,  my friends gave this advice to me and it has worked for me for years.
---
Classic Taurens look amazing. I wish they had more class options.
---
All but the main AHs were removed at some point, and then added back into the game when they decided to have them be linked. There was definitely a time when there was no AH except in IF for alliance.
---
I play a 46 alliance rogue on Thunderfury and so far it feels pretty fair. Maybe once i hit the 50s ill start running into more 60s and get destroyed but so far its been fine. I have noticed that in contested zones there is usually less alliance than horde, but hey Im not in a race to get to 60 so I like my self some PvP on the way(just recently got Sergeant)
---
Can you find any clips of alliance doing this in orgrimmar? How about ally camping zeppelins?
---
Thanks for replying!
---
Horde fight each other like rabid dogs. Trust me its a blood bath for everyone.
---
Emergent gaming to roleplay as a raid boss. Neat
---
Netherwind is the same. Even as a rogue I tend to die at least once getting to BRD, and probably once getting to BRS.
---
Can't wait for BGs. Not just because they're fun, but because most of the BRM campers will be gone. Then it'll just be the wpvpers who will likely be alone or the other groups heading in for a dungeon.
---
&gt; which were (and probably still are), of course, unpopular.
---
only with the crazy ppl here, which make up a very small percentage of the community
---
You sound salty
---
Thats the real goal right now haha. Double Deathbringer
---
Shards does not despawn, but healthstone, soulstone and all the other stones despawns
---
I so badly want a PvP to PvE transfer. I WANT OUT.
---
Around 15 minutes or a bit more, but not more than half hour.
---
I personally use Heal Rank 2 for the smaller less important heals and max rank everything else. I don't renew unless I'm on the move too or a tank healer is struggling. I don't think I've used any Greater Heal once in raids. I typically just Inner Focus and pot once and don't equip my Second Wind but have run out of mana a little early sometimes. We have good regen though so I just wand for a bit then get back in it.
---
Is your raid running HealComms? If not get it because that lets you use those slower heals without someone else jumping in and causing overhealing.
---
Looking up how many times X got an HK for Y in the last 24 hours would likely be a fairly expensive calculation to do in real time, especially when dozens of people get credit for the HK. Simply giving base honor divided by the number of tags getting credit is basically trivial and only uses info they already have on hand.
---
“and the moron are you...”
---
Lol, PvP servers.
---
They should be present, as all the comments on Wowhead are from people that commented in patch 1.9 onward, and their [dungeon guide](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/temple-of-atalhakkar-sunken-temple-classic-dungeon-strategy) for the instance specifically mentions them. Unfortunately, it just sounds like RNG being RNG.
---
Been on reaper since day one in ENVY, it’s been a crazy journey!
---
It will be less of an issue over time. Once the ultra no-lifers hit Rank 13-14, they will drop out and the competition will get easier. The problem is that right now *everyone* is PvPing a ton and nobody wants to wait.
---
If a year from now its still impossible, then maybe Blizzard should step in.
---
Well a lot of us did pick horde just for fun back in the day and its all we know.... dont even know how to get to major cities on ali side.
---
They are listening. Making big macro moves isn't easy or fast. We are a community of 1000% more whiney little bitches than we were back in vanilla.
---
Having said that, I'm still not in love with my server and its situation... but I'm making the most of it while I can right now.
---
max rank with inner focus
---
We shall see. But if private servers are any indication, battlegrounds are far more “efficient” for ranking than world pvp. Cross realm battlegrounds will probably result in less queue time as well, therefore making them even more “efficient”.
---
Thanks. I remember being able so solo AV, but I quit at like 1.8, so 🤗
---
That's called an asshole
---
&gt; it actually takes 3 months of playing WoW like it’s your job to reach r14.
---
Even a job takes only 40-50 hours per week, and then one can have a decent social life, do sports and hobbies on the weekends. 
---
This is rather a mixture of braindead slavery and addiction that requires 80-100 hour per week, serious consequences including health problems and antisocial behavior. At least if it required some skill, strategy, reflexes, like normal competitive games, it could at least keep you sort of mentally fit.. But I am sure these mindless corpse gankers "farming honor" all day are completely dead inside in all aspects.
---
Look like shit. Awful resolution too zoom in
---
They have a hard time holding aggro in pvp, that's for sure.
---
Nope. What you're describing is a duel.
---
according to fight club discord:
---
3009 for Lucifron/Gehennas/Shazzarah    
---
4638-4662 for Sulfuron    
---
3731 for Onyxia and the remaining MC bosses
---
&gt;the worst major feature ever implemented in the entire history of WoW
---
*laughs in Azerite*
---
I think if you need to demand a 45/55 faction queue because you can't win at any pvp you're a ridiculously entitled whiny little cunt and should go play a more casual game.
---
Imagine not being able to join your guild for your weekly raid because it just so happens a lot of your faction is online at the time and not many other of the opposing faction. Anyone okay with this clearly has no idea what they are talking about.
---
Restricting players access to the game because you suck is not a viable solution. Players will go find a different server, or game, if they can't access their character because there happens to be 10% more of their faction online at the time. It's a system that actively incentives people to not play the game.
---
Even if you somehow still think it's a solution to the population problem, it's not a viable business solution.
---
And good for them. They deserve a better gameplay experience than they were getting.
---
You might be right, and I'm certainly not ruling out that other people might have had different experiences than I did.
---
Obviously I saw other players, but it was not the case at all that I had issues tagging or competing for quests. The only time I ran into this was once at the tanaris pirates, and the competition was from opposing faction. After that it was back to pretty much a smooth ride; I was very surprised how easy ungoro was for me.
---
Maybe I notice that more because I had recently done two runs on newly opened private servers where there was no layers and the first weeks of leveling is very cramped.
---
Also I didn't use the instance grinding that many people did, so I guess that could have affected how many were out there grinding quests. ZF/BRD probably mopped up a lot of players that would otherwise have been competing with me in ungoro/felwood/ws
---
That's called an asshole lol
---
So the guy I replied to is basically saying that its not accurate because people might log out or in within that 30 minute window? Lol
---
assholes are assholes
---
faction is not relevant
---
why do ppl think wpvp would be fair? there wont be gank squads post BGs but itll never be "fair". im sorry but you guys are just real fucking dumb.
---
But #NoChanges was always a moronic take because it's impossible to re-live that experience. You can't wipe the knowledge of the game out. You were never going to get #NoChanges and to try and insist that you were only handcuffed them from making good changes.
---
If an addon can do it, I don't understand why the game can't.
---
Not sure if the ratio is that off but there definitely has been a big injection of Alliance players. Ally now has slight dominance as far as ratio goes but I do agree, level and gear wise seems to favor the Horde.
---
As far as the corpse camping and killing lowbies, I’m gonna have to disagree. Through my 30s and early 40s, I was camped and chased down by skulls all the time. I had one situation where it was 5 raid geared skulls vs 2 low 40s (me and a guildie) and we got camped and had to take rez sickness. Now that I’m in the 50s, I’m camped even more on the regular and oddly enough it’s the same people every time. 
---
You’re gonna face these kind of players wherever you go. But I don’t think it’s that bad on Earthfury in comparison to other servers.
---
People in the gaming community have been assholes wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy before streaming my dude. I mean look at us.
---
How is this the hordes fault? 
---
The dumb alliance built the fucking city and they left the weakness in **their** city. 
---
Like hire more competent guards or pay them more or something. 
---
“Guys I didnt put a roof over my house and now this mage can AoE me down....why would they do this”
---
Thats too bad Im having a blast playing wow and I dont pvp.
---
Awful resolution? It's in 4k
---
It was very long in the beginning when there was 16000 online players on most realms. Now the cap seems like 6500 but on the most prime time only for realms with queue.
---
It was harder when people were leveling. Every level had more than 50 people so every level took considerable time. Now only lvl 60 takes time. In most if not all levels there are less than 50 people so if you get the data for 60s you get the rest very quickly.
---
giving druids a resurrect spell so 5 mans with a druid healer werent cancer broke the class huh. yah ok
---
I'm glad it worked for Runescape, now can everyone stop making the same derptastic comparison? Blizzard isn't learning, every change they've made to Classic has been garbage because they still think BfA is the pinnacle of what an MMORPG should be. RS3 came out in 2013 and they've had 6 years of watching people play and getting feedback. Blizzard is still rolling out constant content and expansions for an infinitely larger project than Runescape.
---
Go see if Jagex will write Classic+ for you while the rest of us corpse jump our way to old raids because Blizzard's contribution to Classic has fucked it up.
---
And you're a giant hypocrite, clearly you have no leg to stand on and just want Blizzard to shape the game around your fragile little ego.
---
I'm sorry you suck so much, go play an easier game.
---
Private servers had dynamic respawn on lotus, on northdale it was commonly spawning around the 5 minute mark or less during primetime. That and a guaranteed spawn in every AV definitely put the price a lot lower than what it's likely to be, even with the population being smaller.
---
Just keep reminding them that things get better in AQ.  Because they are not going to be wanted to tank for the hard bosses of BWL.  The warrior t2 gear and weapons out class the feral druids that don't get much if anything from t2. 
---
Also, give a trial period of 2 raids until new recruits get priority for gear that people want to use their DKP on.  I really do not think DKP systems suit MC loot structure well.
---
I have a buddy that's around this.  Has 3 60's and his main is decked out in MC gear.   He "works from home" a lot.
---
Shamans are dead last in the duel league, on average. Followed closely by druids. Warriors have done exceptionally well since they allowed FAPs in the mage matchup.
---
Hear, hear!
---
All of modern wow feels like an amusement ride to me.  You'd NEVER get a dungeon like WC in modern wow, at least not when I last played it (WoD).  There's no feeling of exploration in modern dungeons.
---
Okay? So I can just outkite you until your free action potion is done.  Frost mage owns warriors man.
---
If your guild has only 1 raid team and it's still a revolving door, then there might be more issues with your guild. Rethink the recruitment process or look into what is causing people to leave. My guild has had a pretty consistent roster for 3-4 weeks after building out our core raid team. Regular player attrition shouldn't have this much effect on your raid team.
---
Arms is great in dungeons but for raiding you will go fury for a lot of reasons. Mainly because MS takes up a debuff slot.
---
Balance is hard to quantify because there will always be offsets and you often won't even notice PvP groups of your own faction. But I'd say Mograine feels pretty balanced.
---
I do really enjoy how hostile the world feels now. Even moving to a dungeon feels tense and you get suspicious of everyone around you.
---
Ah gotcha.  I don't know much about the issues personally given I haven't played in about 3 or 4 weeks.  I'm only going off what I've been reading in the past few days.
---
If they don’t MC, they’ll just chain sheep for 20 seconds, or fear .I feel like MC should obviously be fine unless you go further with it by instantly removing Honorless Target. Or a simpler solution, allow honorless target to decay, but not instantly disappear while MCd.
---
I’ll second this, although I’m Alliance as well, so a Horde opinion would be nice. I’ve yet to experience one of those “rage quit” moments where I get camped for an excessive amount of time, or deal with those infamous BRM deathruns on other servers.
---
Roaming gank squads don’t seem to be a big issue, Horde are not so brazen as to spend their days camping in Ironforge. But the PvP is certainly there if you want it, the battles for Azuregos have been legendary.
---
Good point! I need more buttons for all these spell ranks lol
---
Do you not have the report?
---
GFPP is definitely required for melee dps/tanks, but ranged and healers can absolutely get away without it.
---
Landed in Menethil the other day with a friend. They said to me "I wonder if Wu is around"
---
"That afk 56 Warlock over there says not"
---
"Ah. Good point."
---
Should have stayed on TF. Was definitely Horde heavy while leveling but the alliance population really came into their own. The alliance on this server fucking love to PVP. I’m always getting camped at lights hope. There’s always some fucko camping Duke H. Getting into BRM took 30 minutes last night. I literally got camped in Kargath once.
---
I noticed this too when playing on PVP servers, my main is on a PVE server and I can see people from crazy distances away, but on PVP servers it feels like players including the enemy faction don't pop up until they're right in front of me
---
I think it's their way of trying to fix the mass amounts of lag world PVP causes.
---
There's so much WoW lore it's hard to choose where to start.
---
I'd say reading the synopsis of the games as they were released (WC &gt; WC2 &gt; WC3/FT &gt; WoW) to get a better understanding of where the game is currently and how certain things have gotten to where they are.
---
After that, you can check out the wiki which is full of lore and amazing little details.
---
You were wise when I was not. I did the same thing: rolled PvP in vanilla, had fun but could see how this could be a problem for me 15 years later with actual responsibilities. Alas, I rolled on a PvP server this time. Dumb idea, though in my defense I thought BGs were going to be a loooong time from now--also thought the honor system wasn't going to release as fast as it did to exacerbate the problem.
---
Honestly the entire PvP system is old and crap. It promotes ruining other people's experience just for "honor" points.
---
Here you can read about all lore in bullet points.   https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_(unofficial)
---
Oh hi, fellow vanilla Dragonmaw player here. I remember Zizek just running around BRM MCing ppl into the lava all day like it was his job 😂
---
Not much easier to level at 50+ as horde on Stonespine. Cant go anyehere without getting slaughtered by groups of allies..
---
&gt;look at what it did to the contrast 
---
You mean it actually gave it a contrast? I'm confused at what you mean.
---
I think BWL will be just slightly harder than MC.  I still think most guilds will be clearing it easily on reset.  The damage output is so much higher than it was in vanilla.  Killing stuff faster makes everything so much easier.  The hardest part about BWL was Vael and that was just a DPS check.
---
Lmao same man. My buddy and I were both mocking him when we were so excited pre launch now neither of us play.
---
F for the worst server of all time.
---
Blasted lands no, winterspring yes.
---
Blasted lands have a TON of hp (they are raid trash), whereas winterspring is just elite mob status.
---
It can be slow for BRD and beyond too, particularly after 11;00 pm server time.
---
Hey that’s that point
---
Did they? Are they you and have your experiences? Are they **possibly** first time players? One of my guildies is 15. He was 1 when the game came out.
---
There is no punishment for going Horde on a PVP server due to cross realm BG's. Every private severer was 50/50 pop or FAVORED Alliance slightly due to a BG queue based on server pop and the Horde still had a longer queue due to having much better racials. The game was broken before launch when streamers didn't fight for no cross realm BG's and in fact lobbied for them because all they care about is their dumb stream. Those same streamers have quit Classic due to the problem we told them would happen.
---
Because there is no punishment almost every single PvP player went Horde. I don't know how delusional you have to be to think the game is in any way balanced with racials and the grenade meta when every competitor in the duel tournaments is Horde with no Paladins in sight. In addition to this Alliance players are going to be in BG's with PVE server players. **None of this crap happened until late Vanilla and it was just to prep for TBC where BG's no longer mattered at all.**
---
Enjoy the 24 hour queues for wsg. You are going to stomp the Alliance in AV until people get bored of a broken 1.12 AV in a week and just base rush. When that happens Alliance will win that wearing PVE gear, never queue for he other BG's and never go out into the world.
---
Incendius-NA is just fine
---
People missed open world pvp and now they are complaining again that its back...
---
Labels with meanings that change.
---
&gt; Edge Of Madness trinket
---
playing a first time shammy....just looked up the shaman ZG trinket and, not exaggerating here, my jaw dropped and stayed that way for a solid 30 seconds. WTF is that flaming sack of shit someone decided to call a trinket?
---
I still don’t know how douses work. I gather is a quest you have to do but can everyone do it or can it only be done so many times per group? My officers usually handle it but could I do it and keep a backup in case someone forgets?
---
You think you don't like it, but you do.
---
Otherwise you'd take your time and spend it elsewhere.
---
There is a bug where sometimes switching in and out of cat form it will not apply.  There is a macro out there that I am too lazy to look up that will cancel the aura and apply it for your cat form macro.
---
I regularly fail 3 times in a row if I forget my enchanted herb gloves in the heat of the moment. Managed 3 last night
---
If it is their way of countering the problems on the servers, they need to amp up the servers. It's causing further problems for pvpers, who are not able to fight properly.
---
Wait BGs are gonna be cross server?
---
This. This is all anyone needs to know. no way to transfer to a PvE server because Blizzard is terrible at customer service.
---
So you really think alliance never done it? Just curious. 
---
Ally camping Zeppelin at ogri every other day on netherwind. No kidding
---
Going to DM as horde is cancer but other than that I think its fairly balanced.
---
Why not just reroll on a over server?
---
I would bet he is not innervating himself ;) edit: using it on a shadowpriest I totally understand though
---
we are blaming bliz for this for a very easy reason. had they stuck with nochanges and not increased server pop cap exponentially the pvp situation wouldn't exist. The biggest issue is there are way to many people on the server with no method of ranking up other than murdering non-stop. I completely understand people are being complete jerks about pvp because they have been incentivized to do so. They opened up the honor system without bgs thats mistake 2. Combine that with huge pops and no changes to respawn rates for supplies and your choices at 60 are pvp, try to get a dungeon (which lets be honest you probably don't need at this point because you have your pre-raid bis gear), or try to farm gold...except you cant farm anything real for gold because respawn rates suck and literally every node is camped for anything you might want to farm. This is why so many are just raid logging now. Blizzard has made a series of short sighted decisions that seem to be self sabotaging.
---
And that’s why I love that both exist. They’re basically completely different games now
---
Warrior tank: anticiption, improvee shield Wall, improved taunt or improved revenge (stun). Where Will you put Those 7 points ? (For raiding)
---
They absolutely were NOT like this, to the extent were seeing now
---
I have had my asshole drug out of my butt everyday for the last month and i wouldn't change anything. I log in and it might as well be a god damn blacked.com ad. There are 5 ally ready to fuck me up; But mama didn't raise no bitch. I push on and do my quest that should take 5 mins but it takes me 45 mins.
---
to be FAAAIRR
---
Playing Boomkin is like being the guy/girl in the mascot costume during a basketball game.
---
Youll never be the star, or even close to the MVP but youll definitely lighten the mood a bit.
---
Nah if that's your only experience, by then they were a joke. TBC removed almost all of the bonus threat generation tools shaman had and gave them dual-wielding to make up for it I guess. In classic the basic tools are there, but there just aren't advanced tools to make them a mainstay tank.
---
It definitely looks better than the default, weird dudes on here who like to disagree with everything
---
You blame the no changes crowd for playing efficiently when the population size is the real culprit. The world of azeroth was designed around having a set number of players per server. Blizzard has quadrupled that number and then some with the layering. Now we are stuck with 10k players on a server designed for 3k and we wonder why the pvp choke points are unplayable. The no changes team was right, this issue lies solely in the hands of blizzard. The company that didnt want to do any of this classic nonsense from the start.
---
What do you mean they are dreaming? We have people on our server who are rank 7/8 on both factions and farm about 200-300k honor weekly. This is how much they need to farm in order to be in top brackets because we are on a heavy pop server that's pretty competitive. If they aren't getting rank 14, then I don't know who is. Also bgs are out next week, and this will largely stop being a problem.
---
If you can’t extrapolate from my post that I’m talking about the dominant faction on each server (which is usually horde) then I’m not sure what to tell you. 
---
As for whether it’s human nature, I think you missed the entire content of my message. Just because something is “human nature” (which is arguable) doesn’t mean you have to behave that way. 
---
Come to think of it, did you read what I wrote at all?
---
Youre doing well but I would suggest speccing to 31/20 at your level of +healing.  The extra mana and PI will be much more beneficial to both yourself and the raid team at this point(assuming you have MC on farm with no problems full clearing).  The flash heal style is the predominant MC healing style just because there is so little damage that you need those quick heals to be able to actually land them and not end up overhealing(this is why druids are so terrible in MC but get better as content progresses) and the fights are so quick you dont need to worry about mana conservation, but you should anticipate moving away from this style of healing in future raids..  At some point you are going to want 8/8 t2 and gheal rank 1 is going to become your main heal.  You need to get used to the rhythm of a 2.5s heal being your main heal at some point.
---
Also,  if you haven't yet,  you should start working towards gathering the materials required to make your Edge of Madness trinket in p4.  It's the best healer item the game and completely trivializes many tough healing fights in AQ and naxx if you have enough of them in your raid team, and it synergizes amazingly with the 8/8 t2 set bonus
---
Well said. 
---
I was on Skullcrusher as H back in the day and I enjoyed PVP thoroughly. It’s not always fair, but that’s not a first hand issue.
---
I was sceptic... I played until now... I rolled on a PvP server as I thought PvE will be boring and I might not play that long at all... I was right. But it might also have been that PvP just pushed me out of Classic even faster. But as you say... the players have changed... gaming changed... it is not what it used to be anymore.
---
I’m baffled this isn’t a thing yet
---
As far as I can rember, they just 'knew better'. A lot of people back in Vanilla had weird ideas and, with actual math and proof way less available than today, they refused to acknowledge they were wrong just because one guy said so.
---
Are you soloing it?  What class?
---
Yeah but you can't see him.
---
The funny part is, you can tank and heal pve with this spec, and also play like a boomy in pvp with int gear too. HotW is just that good.
---
Some YouTube guy has several hundred.
---
It's best not to compare your experience with people that stream or make YouTube content.
---
Im gonna go on a limb here and guess this is not his only character
---
&gt;Arcane Blast 
---
There it is [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e6erul/update_on_flamelash/f9q07oq/). Where are these hacking mages using an ability released in TBC?
---
Lol no. Maybe sometimes but not the majority. If I can get to a brm instance with less than four deaths (when not entering as a 40m raid) it's considered a win.
---
It seems really fair in my experience, Alliance kills lord kazz and Horde kills Azuregos. In my experience the closer you get to an alliance town the more danger you run into. BRM and LHC are constantly changing between horde and alliance control. If I go out in the world solo I am prepared to take a few deaths.
---
Zandalar is pretty shit if you're horde. I'd take that off the list now
---
&gt;StOp LiKiNg WhAt I DoNt LiKe
---
Zzzzzz typical Reddit
---
Warriors have quite a rough life and deserve a give me now and then
---
Totally on point. And the reason why I now basically quit with Classic... it was fun... but now, nothing to do. No reason to grind any dungeons when you have the gear you need... no reason to raid when the stuff you need is so rare that you won't get it anyway... we changed as players, I changed... I enjoyed leveling and the pure Classic feel but now, having reached the endgame... I am saturated :)
---
People are blaming Blizz because on the first day of realm release, there was only 8 fucking realms.
---
That's what I said.
---
Time to bust out the classic:
---
QQ PVP SERVER
---
So much QQ.... get over it or reroll.
---
It's true, big blue is not great at holding anything
---
if you would rather do listening about certain topics or events i would check out the wow lore playlist by a youtuber named "Noble87"
---
here is a link to the chronological order playlist and each video goes into good summary about everything you want to know about
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKsNKZi5Ct8&amp;list=PLV3Yvqnl3FYcsI4px2GaIxUQ8io4kuZ2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKsNKZi5Ct8&amp;list=PLV3Yvqnl3FYcsI4px2GaIxUQ8io4kuZ2s)
---
&gt; Everybody was busy leveling. Many horde and alliance ignored each other because we had shit to do.
---
This is how it was on every server at launch, if you were ahead of the pack.  Leveling on your low-pop server will be the same as it is currently in high-pop (getting constantly ganked and camped) once a larger percentage of your server hits 60.
---
&gt; Imagine not tanking 5mans in arms 
---
Arms is a leveling spec, MTs respec Deep Prot, OTs respec Fury or FuryProt, DPS respec Fury.
---
&gt; switching to a Shield only when needed for packs of 2-6 mobs 
---
Packs of 2 or more mobs huh? So like 90% of pulls.
---
How is mana tide shit?  Because you want to raid as elem?  lol
---
Lost count of the number of times I’ve seen an enemy player appear in the distance. Start making my way toward him only for 6 more players to appear right behind him once it is too late to escape.
---
Just a larger draw distance in general would be appreciated. Sure, back in 2004, computers had problems rendering an environment with lots of 3D models, but anno 2019? Come the fuck on, if I can view the Shimmering Flats from Thousand Needles, then I should be able to see whatever and whoever is walking across it.
---
It was for PvP :) But thank you! I didn't know you could play both factions on PvE either :)
---
Balancing progression and player expectations is a guild issue, if no one wants to accept OEB then it needs to be assigned in such a way where people are compensated
---
I didnt hate my when my server had 2 layers.. I still saw the same people in town and out in the world, but it wasn't impossible to farm resources..
---
I'm a Holy Pally as well. I bring mana pots. That's it.
---
If I happen to have good food I'll bring it, otherwise it's just pally mats for greater blessings and DI.
---
I suppose it helps that we have fire resist aura, but I've never had an issue with Rag or Ony in dealing with fire.
---
Also, for Shazz we don't use Arcane pots, we just hold melee dps until \~20% and have them burst down.
---
I think there isn't feral gear in MC.  You could get like the ony head, but really they are probably silently shunning you for playing a class that no one really wants to have in their raid.  Talk one on one with some of the loot council members and tell them it is your turn to get some purples.  Explain that you have been farming 3-5 pummelers each week to increase your spot from bottom of the meters to middle of the pack.  Explain how you are never late to the raid and always bring mongoose and other agility consumes, fire protection pots, and healing pots.  
---
If you are not doing these things, well, that means to me you shouldn't be getting loot anyways in any raiding runs unless you are doing a pug/alt friendly run with free MS &gt; OS rolls.
---
And if those labels shifted down dramatically, wouldn't high pop realms get queues, even massive queues? Did that happen with layer removal?
---
Then you must not have been there. It certainly was on Tichondrius.
---
Yeah I transferred from lightnings blade to gorgonnash to play with some rl friends via paid.
---
Yeah pardon me, so moonkin meta is to go engineering as the arcane goggles are Bis. I’m wondering if anyone has had any notable results taking alchemy instead of engineering, as moonkin have massive mana issues, and I think the philosophers stone may help a good bit.
---
The last poll I saw that was between classic forever, classic+, and TBC classic forever was the lowest and TBC was the highest but only by a few percent.
---
Better yet, learn your class and learn the stat mechanics so you can make your own decisions instead of robotically following some internet guide which is not always right and doesn't account for all specs or playstyles.
---
Witchblade has int, not stamina
---
Yes. On Herod we run around individually until we find another person /wave then /bow before we wait 30 seconds to make sure they are prepared to fight. If another fellow player sees us fighting he will patiently wait by until the contest is over. If he also chooses to fight the opponent he waits 3 minutes as to make sure the enemy has most if not all of his cooldowns ready. It's been a really wonderful environment so far.
---
Edit: I forgot to mention BRM. There never seem to be any issues for either faction getting into the mountain. Once inside there is usually quite a few players lined up saluting you and clapping for you on the way into your instance.
---
And I'm certain you're not remembering correctly. No 10+ min CD has ever been allowed in arenas.
---
It really does suck. They actually just lowered the render distance again to combat server lag for big scale pvp. From what ive heard they had to also do that on larger private servers.
---
Go to retail cause that change will never happen
---
Playing a ret paladin is boring most of the time, can't really blame them
---
Exact same reports and answers as 15 years ago
---
Yeah definitely will go back up for BWL and on
---
If you have excess gold to funnel into this alt do it.  It will definitely increase your power till 60.  Just remember that OP feeling will go away.
---
Think about what you want to do at 60.  Are there better weapons/gear to buy...LHH
---
Me neither. When it happens to you it just feels wrong though.
---
No, I get it.  OP clearly says it's the players fault, not Blizzard.  Like you said, it is Blizzards fault for mismanaging the servers.
---
Gloves of might are competitive/very good too.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e64dx5/eu_flamelash_officially_first_server_to_die/
---
Correction, TBC turned Druids into COMPLETELY FKN OP nonsense that at the time, EVERYONE FKN HATED.
---
You're just mad that they aren't FOTM in classic... Git gud, our best freaking healer is a druid, wtf is your excuse?
---
Hmm, I like the idea of releasing a dev toolkit and the ability to buy/rent servers to tweak on. That would be actually really cool, but incredibly unlikely.
---
1. Yes, it is fun, even as a casual player.  
---
    Note:  I would avoid alliance on certain pvp realms for at least another few weeks though.  You may be ok, you may be honor farmed by horde.  If you want to roll on a pvp realm, look for a balanced server.
---
2.  I haven't had any issues finding people to play with.  Get a good guild that is active the same time you are typically online.
---
If you want just get a taran icebreaker, +7 damage (cheap ench) and let that weap take you to 60.  Pretty nice 2h fury weapon especially if you learn to "sit/stand/crit" and proc enrage + blood craze on demand.
---
Thanks to all of them. Lol
---
I'm not saying people won't hit rank 14. I'm saying that the if the sheer volume of people who are out "farming" on a day to day basis think they're getting there too, they're in for a shock.
---
It will stop being a problem if the queues aren't bad. We don't know if it's all servers or just PvP servers going cross-realm, or if it's west/east coast only, etc. In some of those scenarios, Horde will still have queues.
---
Big difference between that and a dps caster taking +healing BiS.
---
Lol. Thanks for describing one of my favorite hobbies in such a unique way
---
Tryhard furies use them all the time if threat allows
---
A hunter pet can hold aggro decently while leveling as BM. Once you hit max level and start getting gear, they don't generate enough threat to hold aggro long.
---
They'd have to be fools not to release BGs as cross-realm, but then on the other hand they've reverted other 1.12 changes such as the mounts change.
---
Guys why do people steal cars in GTA? 
---
Mhmmm idk maybe its in the name. 
---
Guys why do people act like its a full on war in world of warcraft? 
---
Mhmmmm idk maybe its in the name?
---
One thing I will say is that on PvP servers people often choose not to fight each other. So it's not simply "run into enemy players = fight." And there's sometimes communication in your zone about which enemy players are being aggressive, etc.
---
Wait... Are you joking right now?
---
Even then, average player takes around 250 hours to level. People who play 3 hours a day have been 60 for a few weeks. A normal player is still gearing up in blues. 
---
Its people who play well above average that are running out of stuff to do.
---
I think this why I liked the badge system in BC and kinda sorta in WotLK but for whatever reason liked it more in BC. I didn’t get to do BT or sunwell at least not that far into them but did a shit ton of Kara, SCC,  heroic dungeons, BGs and arena. The badges were an alternative way of rewarding time spent on other activities besides raids and were giving people a chance at mid tier loot. It wasnt perfect but I didn’t mind it.
---
Maybe they want details but prefer recount for the damage meter
---
Screens shots wouldn't represent what he's talking about.  He's referring to the output of his monitors, so he'd have to take pictures and post those.
---
If you have a phone and a computer or something, you can also try it yourself.  Pull up the picture on both devices and you'll probably see a difference in contrast, color and brightness.
---
There was a picture like last week of alliance on org AH roof killing people
---
Lol good one buddy, regardless of if it happens or not I'll still be playing classic, doesn't bother me that much.
---
Either way there was a macro you could use that popped every hard hitting move in a row and you could do insane damage.
---
Yeah it's a dream scenario, would be so cool.
---
This subreddit is the only one i've seen with so many pictures of screens using phones instead of screenshots its baffling. Its full of boomers I guess so it makes sense
---
I'm doing fine. Blizzard isn't.
---
I feel like if your raid team wipes on UBRS you're going to have a rough time.
---
Seems good to me!
---
WERE
---
Thank you, I will take you up on that next time I log on!
---
Only Alliance side, and you always need 2 daggers as a rogue.
---
It's that they are instantly removing it by forcing you to attack something. They don't want to wait so they are taking a short cut to save time.
---
Can you imagine if there was a Tenacity buff similiar to the Wintergrasp buff in WotLK that didn't have a cap and adjusted your stats to the number of players in a zone? I wonder how strong the Alliance players on servers like this would be?
---
Patchwerk is more than fine. Useless raid gank squads on both sides. Getting to dungeons takes long for everyone. Server is pretty close to 50/50 and no faction can farm anything meaningful in peace. Just like a pvp server is supposed to be.
---
But then again, open world pvp isn't supposed to be fair. It has always been about having an advantage to act on. No one wants fair fights in the open world. That's what duels are for.
---
The whirlwind axe quest river in hillsbrad
---
No it wouldn't have. With no changes we are stuck with the garbage honour system that requires you to play 20 hours a day if you want to be on top.
---
I wonder how many times he ran out of Mana posting that lol
---
We can agree to disagree, but I do want to say that I'll agree with the heart of what you're saying. In the end, it's the quality of the people, not the class/spec, that makes raiding fun. And I apologize if I came across as arguing against this point. I was perhaps a bit overzealous.
---
Oh no doubt, that's just stupid. But it's a bit disingenuous for bis lists to include items that are way more bis for some than others. If the priest with us hadn't rolled on it too I would have felt a little bad.
---
There is no MSBT specifically for classic in the twitch app or anything but I found one that someone ported from retail to classic. Google around and you should find it. Then download and extract it to classic/interface/addons
---
Yes. Does not change my previous point.
---
I don't begrudge them at all. A small part of my emotional side looks at them as cowards and me as brave, but 99% of me doesn't blame them. It's a video game, designed for entertainment and happiness, and they were seeking that very thing. I do have slightly more respect for those that stayed, but I guess that contradictory paradox is a part of being a human :)
---
Flamelash is the first server where the horde is confirmed to have won the war? #1
---
It's actually a completely avoidable and fixable problem.     
---
To avoid it you put a faction specific queue on character creation/login as soon as balance is out 5% from DAY ONE. Hey look, people are happy to reroll a level 18 character if it means no queues. Problem solved.    
---
If you stick your head in the sand and wait till worldwide servers are now 60:40 horde 3 months in, well now you have to offer faction changes (yes, that means sham/pal get a free class change of their choice too) in conjunction with faction specific queues. Yes it will be disruptive but it would 100% fix the problem. The only exscuse for letting the game die rather than fix it is because you want the game to die.     
---
This problem is not going away. It will get worse with every content release from now for as long as Classic lives (especially if it goes to TBC or any sort of wPvP content is ever added).
---
Go pve unless you’re horde, there’s only one server where alliance don’t get destroyed (assuming you’re North American), and it’s heart seeker.
---
Anathema, horde are usually out doing WPVP just as much if not more then alliance. 
---
And being on alliance side is surprising how much people are willing to come help you if your getting ganked/camped.
---
The other 99.99% of people aren't playing kickball though. 
---
The comparison to WoW would be that someone is in a kickball league. On thursday evenings, from 9pm-11pm, they go and play kickball at the local baseball diamond with a bunch of other adults. 
---
They play two hours, maybe go out for a beer afterwards, go to bed, and get up for work on friday. 
---
Then, you have the 'casual' kickballer. The practice kickball an hour a day, basically whenever they can find the time. 'Oh, I can't join the kickball league with the hardcore kickballers, I have a family.' 
---
Dude, most of the people in the kickball league have a family. They put their kids to bed before they go to kickball/their spouse watches the kids on thursday night. But also, sometimes family or something else does get in the way and they miss thursday night kickball once in a while. No big deal.
---
When you were growing up, were your parents literally busy every single night? Like they couldn't even join a book club? 
---
I understand that there exist a set of circumstances where someone can't raid. I'm not saying that these people don't exist, I legitimately know a bunch of people who can't commit to a casual raiding schedule. But for the people who legitimately believe that they can't raid because they aren't hardcore enough, I'd be willing to bet that 80% of them are facing a social barrier as opposed to a time barrier.
---
Wait... It's NOT pre-nerf difficulty?
---
Then why the FUCK am I paying for this game?
---
If what you say is true, I'm cancelling tonight, this is fkn bullshit
---
i literally got into an argument with a guildie the other day who called me out for being negative and rude when all i said was ''it's more realistic that blizzard is investigating a bug vs blizzard is disabling honor gains from the hours of 3am to 8am to slow ranking'' like dude.... they dont need to slow it... its already slow....
---
While I totally agree with your analysis, I just wish to temper it with the fact that things will calm down. For a few reasons, bg's siphoning wpvp, eventually the first wave will get the gear they wanted or players will give up and realize that the vanilla honor system is a bogus time sink. This will lead to less ferocious wpvp, similar to phase 1 on pvp servers. What I wish blizzard could help players figure out though is data on horde/alliance ratios and set up free transfers/faction changes to encourage a healthy balance.
---
Ok, but we weren't talking about macros, we're talking about recklessness specifically...
---
PALADIN BEATS WARRIOR : THIS IS SO AMAZING IT DESERVES CAPITAL LETTERS
---
they do tho. horde use the excuse they honor farm, but they kill every single low lvl they see too. all horde pvp players deserve their servers to die.
---
an hour? thats it? Damn, i read it was like a 0.8% drop chance, hence I went to the AH. Well that and there was a 5 man horde group at the farm spot when i turned up.
---
PLEASE TELL ME you guys are joking, is it seriously post nerf?
---
What is the fkn point even then?
---
Welcome to WoW. I have characters in retail (eight in fact) that I’ve sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into since 2006, yet here I am leveling up another one in Classic.
---
This “oh great, another time sink” excuses for not re-rolling are getting pretty stupid, because that’s all WoW is, a massive time sink.
---
Getting inside brm in less than 30 on a pvp realm.
---
Counter weight just increases weapon attack speed, right? So, when shapeshifted, that doesn't do anything.
---
What is your question
---
&gt; all horde pvp players deserve their servers to die.
---
lmao word
---
pretty boring video tbh
---
So by my calculations, you have spent most of your waking hours playing WoW.
---
Please consider taking a break from the game. That isn't healthy.
---
My raid (one-shot cleared MC about 5 times so far, was progressing for the 3-4 weeks prior to that) has 3 primary tanks with one designated as 'main tank'.  On boss fights the 'main tank' starts as the primary tank and off tanks only pick it up if the MT dies for some reason or is in a bad CC or something. 
---
We have two more primary offtanks when needed (feral druid and fury warr with a tank set) for fights like Garr or Domo where you want a little more tanking potential. 
---
It comes down to guild preference tho.  Some guilds I think only go one main, one off.
---
Yea I did see this shit coming a mile away. I told you so, all of you. A few weeks before layers disappear, 3 months before servers are migrated and cut, then 5 months before it's just the private server nerds running their playground even further to the ground. Oh and everybody talked so much shit to me. I have plenty of delightful pm's from people "disagreeing" if you could call it that.
---
I don't think battlegrounds could save the game. It's pretty much over. The first few weeks were great because it was fun playing the game like it was the first time again, but even the ps nerds aren't playing vanilla like we did in vanilla. The play style for everyone has changed and that's why retail is better in a lot of ways.
---
I'm mostly mad because the #nochanges people ruined the chance for us to have a grand slam. The game could have been amazing but instead we got to replay a 15 year old game that was a shit show then and it is worse now.
---
Is this an addon or ??? How do you make your game look like this
---
is it? i only wish
---
Well I let a guildy mage have Bonecreeper Stylus because I knew it was more strictly BiS for her. I now have a +18 healing wand and I want the +4 mp5 from DMN but nobody runs that. I did that for a guildy, don't know if I'd do it for a pug.
---
True, but grinding exalted faction in classic is terrible compared to anything modern.
---
I did +7 damage for the gold.  If I got ravager, I would have put fiery on that, but now I have thrash blade that I am about to enchant with +4.  And a +7 on my stoneslayer (2h ulda sword).
---
Yea not sure wtf that guy is saying, wotf is insanely broken. It will feel like it’s always up and it blocks charm too - ie seduce. Horde is just too broken. I can promise you that you will regret warlock on alliance if you pvp
---
Where'd the lights go?  It's dark in here.
---
Had a sPreist jump me at 50% in Azshara at a demon camp then proceeded to spit and spam ok boomer at me. 
---
Me and a druid friend then sat on his body for our alloted 4 kills and let him go. About 5 minutes later i see the ok boomer yells again and a message in general about a sPreist sitting on their corpse.
---
Someone took rez sickness and hearthed that evening.
---
Sorry im not sorry.
---
Honestly most raids should alternate main tanks so they have people with experience and gear in case the main tank can't show or leaves.
---
No, because then you won't have people asking for Korrak every 2min in AV.
---
Don't give up hope yet, wait it out another week or so. The roving gank squads will probably subside once they can get more H/hr running BGs.
---
We don't even have an option for view distance like we did then. I definitely remember seeing other players from greater distances in OG WoW. We will know when AB releases, I remember being able to see players and even /target &lt;name&gt; from one end to the other.
---
As a level 60? What tends to bring people there besides maybe helping a lowbie out?
---
I have Mik running. I put it straight into my add-ons folder.
---
FWIW my addon searches usually start with "classic wow add-on ______"
---
As a solo Horde rogue, I camp the “Y” intersection in northern EPL as the road heads towards Strat.   While doing this, I see just as many solo horde players passing by as I do alliance, and will sometimes run into Alliance rogues trying to do the same thing.
---
A tank shortage has just kind of always been a thing while I've played this game. Pretty much any given moment of any day someone will pick you up to be a tank. To a similar, but generally lesser degree, healers as well.
---
Back in WotLK when the group finder was added I would queue as tank because I was instantly picked up. As holy I would have a queue of 2-5 minutes while as dps could be around 15-20 minutes. The same held up back in BC as well. In both cases, even after group finder, it was common to see tanks sell their service. This didn't work as heals or DPS. Similar thing happens now where the tank often wants the first orb in strat live or all BoE greens, etc.
---
moron 1 vs moron 2
---
I think I remember someone making a post recommending that they release quest upgradable dungeon sets earlier for the more casual players that might not be in a good raiding guild or don’t raid. Can’t remember what phase they recommended, either BWL or AQ. Probably wouldn’t be a bad idea like the early Dire maul and BG release.
---
Just let me transfer to a PvE server..
---
I played an astronomical amount of pvp and pve back in original and the pvp is completely different now, as has been stated.
---
I'm Alliance on Bigglesworth and any 60 farm area or related farm area is beset by dozens more horde than alliance and god forbid you even try to go to BRM.
---
I was in a top 6 US Guild raidwise on a PVP server and while BRM mountain fights definitely happened on raid days it wasn't like this shitshow where there are 50+ horde just sitting there at all hours.
---
This is a problem that isn't ever going to be fixed but will be mitigated when these jackasses have to sit near BG masters.
---
I’d say it depends. On a PvE server, it’s bragging rights and faster clears. However in PvP sometimes badass gear is enough to intimidate and win a fight.
---
On a private server I got kang for my warrior and it was the difference maker in fights. In some cases, the enemy saw my kang and it screwed up their pvp mindset (popping cool downs earlier when it probably wasn’t needed to etc). The proc is also nice for fights where you need to bleed an opponent out.
---
It's been amusing seeing people realize how painful some of these older systems are. I hope everyone who complains is keeping in mind Blizzard's words of "you don't want this".
---
I wonder how many people made fun of Blizzard saying that, and are now asking Blizzard to make changes in order to make their experience more friendly.
---
I hope your right... but I think I didn’t make my point clear... the biggest reason I’m unsubbing is blizzard is showing it’s incompetency ... the have dropped the ball with classic by doing exactly what ruined the game in the first place, catering to big streamers and the top 1%. I’m level 59.. still not 60 (granted phase 2 slowed me down a bunch) the faction imbalance should have been managed from day 1, wPvP should never have been released without BG, the phases are coming too fast, the server sizes are twice the vanilla size... and I guess I’m just disappointed in blizzard. I expected vanilla and classic is not vanilla
---
PvP on my server seems to be fair. Alliance has spots they usually control (DM, Feralas, and the Bulwark), and Horde has their areas (Burning Steppes and Chillwind come to mind, but there are probably others). There are usually shifts in who controls BRM, THP/Kargath, and LHC. I guess the "unfair" part is that battles are usually tipped one way or another based on who has the bigger group, but that just seems like a natural part of wPvP to me. If I needed to have perfectly balanced 10v10 fights, I'd wait for WSG to come out or roll on a PvE server. I'm enjoying wPvP for what it is, because it will probably change dramatically soon.
---
I just give up on getting my missing kills. There's no way we can prove it unless we took meticulous and detailed screenshots every day.
---
Blizzard sucks, years of them sucking has beaten me down.
---
we all love WPVP. It's just that no one likes the current WPVP
---
When that extra sp/healing is unnecessary its not really a tall order at all.  Also, I would argue that the extra 10% mana more than outweighs the loss in stats because it allows more total casts and thereby lessens the effect of a missed/sniped overheal.  There's a reason that every guild clearing MC in under an hour has their priests specced for PI.
---
Things are a lot different from the horde perspective. I’ve been here since day 1. Unable to PUG raids for Alts, takes hours to form an UBRS, LBRS, etc. economy is trash, you get the picture. I rerolled a priest on Fairbanks and have been having waaaay more fun
---
I'm Horde on Sulfuras.  I think I would agree that we have control of BRM the majority of the time.  I havn't been down to Dire Maul recently, might be Horde favored there as well.  
---
I think I see Allies controlling LHC and Everlook more often than Horde does though.
---
I'm a bit of a stats nut, I would love to see unbiased data about which faction has more of a presence in particular areas.
---
the t0 sets(both lightforge and valor) are pretty good starter plate for pvp with high stam and well rounded stats. i'd recommend mix and matching for 4/8 of each as they each give 40ap bonus for the 4piece set bonuses.
---
Can mix/match the pieces are you see fit as far as which 4 to have valor and which 4 to have lightforge but i think prioritizing with stam&gt;int&gt;dmg for these slots is a good idea.
---
hoj + insignia(can swap in barov/deathray/net/spell reflectors etc etc when on cds and depending on matchups) for trinkets,
---
then fordrings for crit neck and 2 hit rings. (blackstone/tarnished elven) to get 5% hit cap
---
back - black baron cape or stoneskin gargoyle cape(stam!) both from strat ud
---
enchants prioritize stam over dmg, 100hp head/legs/chest 9stam bracers etc.
---
as you start to get raid pieces to replace, like judgement/lawbringer, i'd drop valor set bonus first and maybe go up to 6 piece lightforge, the proc is pretty decent
---
also try and maintain 2% hit from gear but you dont need more. if you get raid pieces like ony neck, you can swap a hit ring for a crit ring like the one from drak in ubrs
---
my 2c, hope it helps
---
edit: lol i forgot an important part, the weapon. preraid i think demonshear or malowns slam. enchant with weapon chain until you have better gear and can mix in immune disarm gloves, then can crusader the weapon
---
anyone with a functioning brain knew that wpvp is a meme and nostalgia was the only reason anyone cared about it.  there's a reason battlegrounds killed wpvp because non braindead people actually enjoy structured competition over roaming rape gangs
---
Let the gamer dads seethe, they got bored of making daily posts about having so much fun at level 13
---
So I main a druid, but not a boomkin. Most of my knowledge of boomkin is on a working level rather than a practical one.
---
But one thing I can say is that the philosophers stone will do nothing. I'm an alch on my main and all you use philosphers stone for is for transmutes, as far as I know. Unless there is some use for it I am unaware of. 
---
As a raiding boomkin you will 100% need to have major mana pots, demonic/dark runes, and any other consume that gives you mp5 (like mageblood potion), because you will need it. There are a bunch of different food you can eat as well that will give you mp5 as well.
---
As far as dreamless sleep potion goes, you can't really use it in a fight. Being out of a fight for 12 seconds means you might as well not even be there, but they can be used after combat, but then the question comes, why not just eat/drink if you won't be able to move or do anything for 12 seconds.
---
What I would do is take engineering until you get the bis goggles and if you don't engineering after that or don't find a use for it (hint: engineering is amazing in pvp) you can always drop it and take alchemy.
---
This is the second time I have seen this, but as an alliance I still have yet to land at TP or Morgans without horde camping it and the run from TP to BRD has been a mess and still is. Maybe I'm just really unlucky.
---
Yep. I’m also on Fairbanks. Can confirm I’m in the same boat. And if they don’t let us transfer, I’ll continue losing interest in the game like I already have.
---
Yeah PvE to PvP was a no go because you didn't want people to skip the PvE grind. Currently there is nothing though except for transfers to other PvP realms.
---
A lot of people on the Bliz forums say that people who want transfers "should have known what we were getting into", but I think that's a shit argument against it, and I can't really see a downside to allowing it.
---
Oh, my bad. Knew they were called “healers”, figured they at least tried to do so. I’m a healer, I make the hit points go up and dispel the bad stuff. Figured melee were kicking, so it was never a concern.
---
But still, you can gather them and aoe without fear of spell reflection issues.
---
This is completely wrong. You can loot it once, then it will become unclickable for 25 minutes. There might be a limit to the number of times (or a timer) you can loot the same node before it despawns, but it's definitely more than 4. I've grabbed tubers/songflowers for hours on end without them despawning. If what you were saying was true, they'd all have despawned in less than 2 hours.
---
&gt; Also you want to blame the server size as the problem? Many private servers often had larger concurrent player counts than the largest classic servers with less of an issue. Faction imbalance is certainly a problem, but the solution is to just keep splitting all the servers?
---
Private server players were just more tolerate of these issues.
---
Like, it was expected that you would get camped while leveling and if you went crying on the forums people would mock you. Now, the people crying get empathy and support.
---
Just trying to help you, you looked like youre confused.
---
Looking up minor details like “what does shazzrah do” is not obsessing
---
Quick question, when do titles become permanent?
---
suckers
---
For superfast MC speed runs sure, because you dont need much healing at all when DPS is stacking every type of buff possible. But the OP is not even lvl 60 yet, so it's silly to compare him to the specs being used in a top 50 guild.
---
And if extra healing is not helping, then that extra mana is not helping either.
---
I don't play WoW/Classic but a giftee for a Secret Santa I'm in does. I know their battletag and I think I know which faction they're on but I don't have any info past that. Any sites similar to destiny tracker that I can use to look up their characters/more info?
---
Smolderwebs great.  Tons of back and forth.  Only problem is the rogues who live in Menethil but that's a design problem.
---
If it takes you 1-2 hours to get into MC you're doing something seriously wrong. Did 2x MC+Ony with mains and alts within 3 hours last night with a world boss kill in between.
---
Like I said, there's tryhards and carebears and we're outnumbered but holding our own.
---
&gt;boss drops which are not really important yet pretty decend aswell.
---
They have some fantastic drops actually (Like the cloth shoulders with 1% hit are really good for warlocks). And its very efficient to farm them non-stop in raid groups, and people who sum them usually get ML and sells the loot to the highest bidders.
---
The bracers comes in the second phase of silithus, and thats also a grind. So people will be in silithus for a loong time.
---
My brd runs we’re getting progressively worse after phase 2. One night they took almost an hour. Me and my friends rerolled PVE the next day leaving behind all of our progress and some pretty decently geared prebis characters.  
---
I like pvp and I wanted to play on a pvp realm, I dealt with ganking and being camped plenty. But 40 fucking dudes at every FP that don’t even care if you’re worth honor just isn’t worth it.  
---
fuck this shit
---
Why cant you people grasp simple logic? no one knew this was going to happen because no one expected the sheer volume of players they will allow per realm. 
---
I rolled pvp for 1v1 or 3v4 or 8v7  not 40v1 or having to form raids just to stay alive for 5 minutes.
---
But please continue the tripe, instead of using even a small sense of logic for once in your life.
---
Yea I use far sight all the time, more for farming than PvP though
---
He posts a disclaimer every few minutes saying if you are not having an improved gaming experience to put him on ignore.
---
I've played all the realms. Some more than others ofc. But my time spent on 3 diff pvp servers was decent. It was in another time also tho so there's that. 
---
But I just hate to  see whole realms die off. I wish there were just a few more pve realms.
---
SCARY...
---
60:40 is terrible. That means that there are 3 horde for every 2 alliance. Or 50% more.
---
I see no problem with that. 
---
But on a serious note, it would be better if the models rendered at a longer distance.
---
Sounds like someone's mad about PvP on a PvP server.
---
Great and active server, as balanced as a pvp server can get it feels. Not too big but will be healthy for a long time. Still some queues some times but its not too bad
---
You appear to be trying to solve an efficiency problem, not playing the game.  Which is fine.  Its just not playing a game. 
---
Any plan for PUG loot distribution will fail because a lot of players just want to play a game.
---
If you want to use some alternative loot based system where things are allocated on a BIS priority....   Well, sounds like you need a guild or a premade group.
---
The "No Changes" group are the absolute worst. There's so many things that would have been improved on with minor tweaks. Dual spec or at least lower cost respecs should be a thing as it's painful for casuals who would like to pvp and pve. Classes should have had slight buffs to make them more evenly distributed (way too many rogues, warriors, priests, mages right now). Debuff limit should have been changed to allow for more interesting builds than "HUR DUR SPAM ONE BUTTON" and bosses should have been made more difficult to compensate. While I like a LFG tab restricted to your own server, I can see how this would bother people so I would concede that one. I would even enjoy seeing some new gear added to promote alternate talent setups like Boomies, Rets, Eles, and Prot pallies.
---
But instead of these positive changes that virtually everyone would enjoy, we're stuck with the exact same game with its faults that have been improved upon over the years. Even though I enjoy it more than retail, there's so much more potential here. It's just that a super vocal group decided they wanted it a certain way and want to live in the past instead of taking the lessons from the past and applying them to make a better game.
---
This is how PvPvE works in every game I’ve ever played that offers it. 
---
I’m not sure what people were expecting.
---
I explicitly remember being able to Hunters Mark rogues from Ally gy from the horde zerker hut in wsg. I remember being able to see Ally ride up to LM from stables while parked on Farm-&gt;LM road. 
---
Hopefully the draw distance isn't borked in bgs.
---
Hate to break it to you but no realm, during Phase 2, is sitting at 30k-40k.  That's what it would take to be 10x the size
---
Yes - while the thrill of being attacked in open world is fun it was because in Vanilla you typically ended up in a 1v2 or 1v1 situation:
---
The original post is calling light to the fact that 9 times out of 10 now in Classic while questing when you do get that World PVP interaction its five or ten people rolling up and ROFL-Stomping you into the ground in two seconds.  It’s not PVP.
---
Lmao I wasnt expecting this either. Good .
---
Well for one, the majority of servers are Horde dominated, so I suspect they'll have 20-30 min queues while Alliance get instapops. Secondly, it is likely that the BG Queues will try and pair you with others from your realm first before searching CrossRealm (faster, more reliable connection, etc), so those who drove alliance off their servers \*may\* have even longer queue times.
---
Third: If you're Alliance and in a Raiding Guild interested in PvP, its gonna be a good time. Paladins are straight up broken in WSG/AB and we have the AV Advantage.
---
"Revenge is a dish best served cold."
---
Weren't the gates of AQ a cross faction effort?
---
You nailed it.  Structured competition is the key word here.
---
lmao, Firemaw is perfectly fine, ofcourse you will get zugged sometiems but it ain't that bad
---
Yeah I am a druid, I use track humanoids a ton, sometimes they pop up on track before I can even SEE them.
---
BWL release would be fantastic!
---
Ok so to that I'll say this: that's your choice. No one asked you to reroll the class you wanted to play on another faction because *they* were having a shitty time. Try to see the difference here. Not only that, but on a PvP server you have to *delete* all your characters on one faction. You don't get to play both sides on the same server.
---
Just hit 55 on benediction, horde side. Also think it's pretty fair but if you believe the comments people post you wouldnt think so.
---
How I judge: sometimes when I run into BRM I get ganked instantly, sometimes I run into BRM and any ally I see immediately starts running away from me. Fair doesnt mean you never die, fair means you die about as much as the other side.
---
Going from a horde-dominated server to an alliance-dominated server, but thankfully it really doesn't matter for PvE (I'm Westfall-Horde)
---
How? Where did you level? I’m dying on my level 54. BRD is obviously a no-go. I’ve just been farming on the outskirts of un’goro and STILL die 2-3 times an hour.
---
That was me last night, except it was alliance doing the chasing.
---
If anything it’ll get worse for the ally in the open world. Horde will sit in queue as they roam. Alliance will have sub 5 minute queues so you’ll see the pvpers in the open world less.
---
Thanks a ton. And thank you for the prompt replies. Have a good one!
---
Lmao so many angry comments from grunts n private gamer dads
---
They're so convinced anything but raidlogging (to spend 4 hours clearing) is a no life waste of time
---
Exactly what I was looking for ty so much! Any weapons come to mind??
---
Lmao, it's definitely not good. Only 7000~ people got an hk. My alt had 1hk for 1 honour and was standing 6900 this week. 2 weeks ago he was standing 18000 for 1 honour. We lost over half in that timespan. 3 relevant raid guilds transferred for easy gains on a small server, not the pvp. 
---
Blizzard should have had faction specific transfers from the start.
---
So just have your faction make your own squad, or team up yourself?
---
Its vanilla, you are suppose to play with others. Its not the solo-player game that retail is.
---
And yes, faction imbalance is shit. But if you get ganked 5v1, then call for aid and try to solve the problem yourself.
---
Yeah 1v1’s just aren’t a thing anymore, I try to be the change I want to see when there’s 2 people fighting. Most of the time I just get sapped and the rogue then helps the other person and then they turn on me. I don’t get the mentality like that but oh well. Just keep trying I guess.
---
Well deserved for using Spy.
---
Our luck is probably swapped. I landed in LHC, got sheeped and then camped while I tried to corpse walk out of that hell whole. My trip to BRD from Kargath is a constant battle of dealing with alliance camp teams until the horde roll through to clear them out for a bit. It's frustrating but not terrible like others are dealing with.
---
Why exactly should a shaman BiS list care weather the item is better for a different class?
---
I don't like pvping
---
I play on a pvp server where my faction is out numbered
---
I'm lvl 55
---
I don't mind the state of the server
---
Bite me.
---
&gt;So who would horde kill?
---
Alliance trying to do raids or grind for gold.
---
That line should be added in the next WoW cinematic short.
---
Yup, more than once I've had to make the decision to hop off immediately after loading on my way to GG on Thunderfury. Better to swim/water walk to shore rather than risk a corpse walk.
---
The last 2 weeks Alliance has had just as much control in world pvp as horde.
---
Incendius is amazing. It´s nothing like vanilla but everyone seems to love it. 
---
BRM is a shitshow but it adds to the fun - it seems the fights there are always 50 vs 50, with control going back and forth. LHC seems to be ally controlled more often than not. 
---
This past weekend I was playing an alt at Nesingwary´s in STV, and it was packed  with allies ganking - but everyone was levels 30-40. Word quickly spread in /1 and soon we had a 10vs10 fight with no high levels involved. This lasted maybe 10 minutes before a couple 60 allys came and scattered us away, giving them control of the area again. Fun times. 
---
The only experience that was somewhat painful has been Onyxia, where allies tend to keep an honor-farming deathball at the portal. I´m sure this kind of behavior will be fixed with BGs releasing.
---
People queuing for BGs will be.
---
First week I got a few hundred kills, maybe 2500 honor.  Like 1500 standing.
---
Second week I got a few hundred kills, little over 3k honor.  1200 standing.
---
Last week I got 6 kills, all solo, so like 900 honor.  900 standing?!?!  Wtf?
---
900 honor last week got me 900 standing?  And the totals calculated *correctly*?  PVP is dead on Stalagg.
---
That’s quite selfish.
---
Sounds like someone's mad that people all of a sudden don't like their little gank squads ganking lowbies for no reason.
---
Strangely ironic for all the Horde wanting 'no changes' to PvP.
---
&gt;Throw in some morons in the middle that blame Blizzard for fuck knows what.
---
For making no attempts whatsoever at ensuring any servers are balanced.  No server pop transparency, no enforcement of faction balance through any measure, further exacerbating imbalance by letting folks on the minority faction to jump ship to servers with balance skewed heavily in the other direction.
---
Then there's things like how Blizz added powerful guards to the Zeppelins because back in the Vanilla days, Alliance camping Zepps was a problem since they used to be the more popular faction.  But now that balance has shifted to favor horde, they haven't done similar measures to address farming at Menethil.  Exact same issue, except even worse since you didn't have to take a FP to get to the Org Zepps.  But now that the roles are switched are they okay with utilizing a fix that is in *the exact same spirit* as a change they made in Vanilla to address that issue?  Nope.
---
Had a warlock need on the healing pants from brd and win against me as well. Feels bad man, thank god there stupid easy to get and obtain and that there’s better pants in DM. 
---
The dude spoke perfectly fine English and said “ yea I can read” after telling him they were healing pants... dude was still so far out there that he didn’t know the difference.
---
I really do feel for the people stuck on crazy imbalanced servers, because my experience with brm has been pretty reasonable and fun (very balanced server). on raid nights, its pretty exciting, everyone gets ready to go in kargath, stealthies scout out some of the way into the mountain, and when we all ride out groups and solos heading into the mountain will stick to us and sometimes in rp ways ("jah goin to deh mtn mon?"). when running in solo, it's like an alliance raid will sweep through, then a horde raid will sweep through, no one staying in one place for too long. similarish at places like lhc, it changes hands fairly often.
---
i think the blame really does rest on blizz allowing such imbalanced pvp servers in 2019. because largely it seems like it's just a numbers game. yeh sometimes things will be shitty in some places, like trying to finish the in dreams quest, but foe the most part there is a back and forthness to the pvp that is exciting and not too soul crushing. i'm not sure what the solution could have been, but the way things turned out on what seems like the majority of pvp servers is a huge bummer.
---
Two sides of the same coin, friend. You should be agreeing with him.
---
Grow up, then learn how ranking works.
---
You really hit him with the “gO To ReTaiL” macro on reddit damn.
---

---
It wouldn't take that long to level again though because PvE leveling is much faster. No ganks, corpsecamping and long corpse runs.
---
Also many server economies are up and running and it will be easy to make money and get gear/bags.
---
Same
---
Seethe
---
It shouldn't, but something like "this is a very mild upgrade" wouldn't hurt. Luckily I didn't farm Briarwood, saw Jed twice got it the 2nd time.
---
Well I appreciate the help
---
What combat text addon are you using?
---
There are a lot more no-lifers than vanilla
---
I jumped a lot between Felwood and Un'Goro.
---
Mostly luck, but the chain in Felwood where you go into and out of the cultist tunnels for a few quests helped, since you're a ways off the path from 60s.
---
Otherwise, non-peak hours. Thankfully I get up early Saturday and Sunday, so I had a few hours to quest then.
---
Oh lol nah I didn't report him.. Stared at the combat log for a while in disbelief.. But yee there is a video explaining what happened. Srsly thought he was hacking lol
---
Yeah but if you look at the examples I cited, do you at least agree that warlocks and mages shouldn't be rolling on +healing BiS which is barely a minor upgrade for them? I don't think it takes much for people to be informed enough to not do that. If they really really don't care and want to just make people RQ in their pugs / not fit in with guild runs that is up to them, they have the freedom to do that.
---
Yes blasted lands my bad( scorpions, boars, and vultures) but badlands are good for farming whelps especially if you have skinning.
---
any tips if i want to fight him back? because i cant outrun them &gt;.&lt;
---
Honestly don't think it's against the rules for Twitch or Blizz. It's kind of a gray area?
---
Tbh I’m not crazy bothered by my missing kills as I didn’t farm or try hard.
---
It just seems clear that there is a problem. Blizzards inability to identify issues is pretty alarming.
---
I think they are worried about the server balance if that goes live. If masses of alliance start fleeing from PvP servers to PvE servere, the already-awful Horde:Alliance ratio on those PvP servers will get even worse.
---
edited my post with 2 options, sorry about missing that small part :p haha. weapon dmg is king in pvp even more so than pve imo. the slowest hardest hitting thing you can find for max burst since sometimes you only get 1 swing when you are in melee range gotta make it count :)
---
Not even close.  Are you joking?  The hardest core of raid guilds on retail raid 40-60 hours the first couple weeks of new content, literally half what you have to do for a shot at R14.  For classic content where we already know how everything works it won't come anywhere close to that.  The hardcore guilds will clear AQ40 in under 8 hours the week it is live, and honestly most will likely do it much faster than that.  
---
Most guilds that play at a decent level clear 100% of available raid content in 90 minutes right now.  90 minutes of PvP a week won't get you rank 8, much less 14.
---
If you want to rank you have no other choice at the moment. This is a poor argument.
---
Then you just keep leveling buddy
---
I can confirm.  Tuesday night there is normally a 1+ hour queue, sometimes ~2 hours to get in.  
---
On Tues/Wed night this week, there was no queue.  Later on in the evening there was a &lt; 20 min queue.
---
Something was different this week.
---
nice
---
At least it's 5 stacks instead of the stacks of 5 I originally thought he was giving out.
---
Id of saved my friend and probably of seen the pally coming
---
How do people know what the demographics of their server are? I see a lot of people saying what the horde/ally split on their server is but when I google for it I don't get anything reliable.
---
Phase 1 PVP was, genuinely, an absolute delight.
---
Yes. 
---
In Vanilla this often lead to one premade giving up when the WSG would take a long time to finish, while not gaining any more kill honor.
---
Also lead to graveyard farming, maximizing the honor, while the druid carried the flag multiple times.
---
On a scale of 1-5 how mad?
---
IDK what that dude is smoking lol. I leveled up on a medium-high server (Benediction) and it was a pain in the balls until I got into the 40s or so competing with other players for quests/mobs.  There were people everywhere even with the layering.
---
\*bows so u can see my fat cock under my skirt\*
---
"I have arrived"
---
\*tips fedora\*
---
This. Not in this way, more in a queue up to join someone elses game mostly
---
Such is life :'(. I'm hoping that someday Blizzard enables some sort of paid server transfer.
---
Modern players aren’t saying there is nothing to do. Nobody is saying that lol. Show me who is saying that .
---
A 48 isn't killing or escaping a 60.
---
Just keep questing, more xp/hr that way anyway than waiting for a group
---
Typical redditor
---
&gt;Looking up how many times X got an HK for Y in the last 24 hours would likely be a fairly expensive calculation to do in real time
---
It doesn't sound that expensive unless you have killed a lot of people. Create a list of everyone i have killed in the last 24 hours. Compare this name to the list.
---
Or just Nat Pagles for those without 4/8
---
Seems like you need to group up like everyone else is... simple logic ya know!
---
Everything that’s happened so far has been insanely predictable. I played back in vanilla and also private servers. How is anyone surprised ? Blows my mind.
---
5 in a row here
---
heart rate increased to 160
---
&gt; Here is the question I ask of you, what is the solution? Do they just release shitloads more servers?
---
Yes. They should have. Blizzard, despite indicators of its popularity, maintained basically right up to the end that nobody actually wanted classic. They stuck their heads in the sand, said "fine! if it'll shut you up we'll make it, grab the wave of cash that comes in, and then you'll all get bored and quit and we can say told ya so". They refused to believe it would be a success right up to and even after they had 12 hour queues. Releasing more servers later as they did helps, but it's too late at that point because people establish themselves on a server right away. Servers released later will always have lower populations because people won't move. They basically botched this by being stubborn about knowing better than the fans what they wanted.
---
The #NoChange group should be furious since they changed the maximum server size which is causing these issues.
---
Guess horde moved in there eh?
---

this just made me crack up at work, cheers
---
Narrator: it wasn’t.
---
Classic received so many changes , the no changes movement failed
---
1 run for my hoj, LMAO
---
I mean yeah pug servers frequently had 30+ slots turning a 5v5 game into 15v15 and bomb plants became pretty much nonexistent. So much so that when server pop dropped to near 5v5 levels bomb plants were still very rare.
---
For me LHC and DM are typically alliance strongholds, usually horde owns BRM when our guild raids. I've flown into LHC like 3 times over the course of 2 weeks and it's always the exact same people ganking too. My guilds basically made Scuba Cops KOS, even if they're lowbies
---
Normally when I see someone say "you kind sir", I downvote. That will continue now
---
I don't think it has anything to do with nochanges, it's that blizz wound up screwing up the realm balances moreso than originally by opening transfers to other realms.
---
Now see you're replying to my comment, not the other guy, so I'll ask you a version of my same question:
---
ARE YOU
---
A) writing OP a 4 paragraph essay EXCUSING them for CRITICIZING pvp guides based on the fact that you personally have not yet found one which has consistently allowed you to beat mages as a hunter, WHICH IN YOUR EYES MEANS THAT ALL GUIDES PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ARE INTRINSICALLY AND UNAVOIDABLY, BY DEFINITION BAD because in every matchup you should be rock and everyone else scissors,
---
B) writing OP a 4 paragraph essay CONDEMNING them for FOR SAYING PVP GUIDES ARE A DECENT START solely based on the fact that you personally have not yet found one which has consistently allowed you to beat mages as a hunter, because everyone knows you're entitled to win every matchup, damnit?
---
Which version of OP are you condemning? The one with the evil twin goatee, or the one without?
---
[It seems they have.](https://i.imgur.com/cs13KLb.jpg)  
---
At least the bankers are putting up a fight.
---
Razorgore is balanced af too, I love the server as alliance
---
If your competing for heals then yea a flash heal will get off sooner then your buddy healers and do the job better. It just comes down to priority imo. No real need to waste extra mana just to have the other healer over heal the same target. From what i can tell, MC is pretty manageable and you have some great gear already so it comes down to you drinking a few extra consumables if you wanted to spend a little extra mana. No biggie
---
OR let people play how they want. If it's such an inconvenience, only group with other min max circle jerk bros like yourself. People play for different reasons.
---
How do diminishing returns work in BGs?  Like does that 24-hour DR apply even if you meet them in *separate* games?  I hope not.
---
That’s what soul stones and ankhs are for brother
---
As I've said, I really can't be arsed doing research on other players classes.  I have no intention of starting now.  I have no knowledge of if equipment with +healing is good for mages or 'locks. 
---
If it's an upgrade, roll away.  If it isn't, don't.
---
If you're the type of player that cares about BIS then you should also be the type of player in a guild.
---
Let us filthy casuals just happily trog through dungeons and roll on any old upgrade.  We don't want to maximise our looting efficiency.  I just want to hit things with my sword and have some of my stats get higher every now and then.
---
Stating that everybody should use an entirely arbitrary (but efficient!) system of loot allocation just won't work.
---
rip in peace
---
the NoChanges people are to blame for a lot of problems.
---
Alliance 60s sitting around in Ironforge might as well be NPCs.
---
after two weeks of failing and getting him to 800hp last week, we got him down on our first try this week
---
Then you don't understand problems of scaling and data consistency. 
---
It's super easy for ten thousand clients to keep track of and add up a single player's individual kills; it's way harder for a single server to keep track of every kill and constantly calculate how many times one player killed another.  They have the raw information, obviously, but it would be prohibitively expensive to calculate the exact number for every tag on every kill.  
---
The server most likely stores HKs as basically a table of "X killed Y at this date/time" with hundreds of thousands to millions of entries, for on the order of a gigabyte of data. Kicking off an asynchronous write for a new kill is quick and easy. Looking up the number of times player X killed player Y is going to take a lot longer and be more resource-intensive (hard drive access), and since they almost certainly use read slaves, they'd have to either give back a number that might be wrong (if an HK hasn't propagated yet) or check the master, which defeats the purpose of having slaves.
---
For the weekly calculation, they just need to run through the list once and keep track of a few things. 
---
Furthermore, only returning "estimated" honor keeps all the honor calculation logic—and potential for bugs—in one spot. If they want to change things they can do it once and there's no chance they change it in one spot and forget to update it in another.
---
Please elaborate.  How should it have been addressed?  Telling people they cannot roleplay as the race they want?
---
I think people are entirely too eager to drop this at blizzard's feet without actually taking more than a few seconds past being upset to come up with a realistic solution or idea.
---
Classic will never be vanilla.  It was never going to be.  People have 14 years of knowledge and experience on the game, the gaming landscape is different, etc.  Nothing is the same.
---
For what it's worth, the phases are mirroring vanilla pretty closely.  DM was only a week or so earlier than the vanilla timeline, the gap between honor and BGs was also similarly short (they did not come at the same time even in vanilla).  You seem to be conflicted on wanting things to be easier or different than they were, but at the same time wishing for the vanilla experience.
---
It's fine to quit if you are not enjoying the game, but not being lvl 60 is not the 99% at this point.  Many, many people are 60.  So I don't agree with the premise that blizz is catering to 'big streamers and the top 1%'.
---
How is increasing server population caps 5x #nochanges? Let's think that one through, shall we?
---
No way would I give up ~80g just to level marginally faster for 7 levels.
---
On the flipside those people that want to flee will either unsubscribe or have to reroll on PVE (which might be less likely I'm not sure). So Blizzard are stuck with the decision, open up paid transfers and make some money but potentially ruin the balance on some servers or lose some subscribers. Both options could end in loss of subs but only one can end with increased payments
---
Somehow I was able to do the escort quest in Searing Gorge last night, first try. Got lucky when a pack of horde ran by just as we were going through the off-the-road path, so they must have missed me
---
Sure but in classic, the issues that started coming to a head later on in TBC haven't yet surfaced (there is still only a single tier of raiding) and in Retail, it long abandoned the design that was prevalent from Vanilla through to Cata.
---
***Technical design stuff starts here -- Skip to my own reply to this comment if design stuff bores you***
---
A lot of people make the error of using the terms Vertical and Horizontal progression in cases where they aren't really relevant. This isn't really relevant to the point, but wanted to hit on this real quick since someone will inevitibly drop the term
---
**Attributes of Horizontal Progression**
---
* Difficulty budget for all content in the same horizontal tier is tuned around a set target value (or range of values for multi boss content, but each set of bosses share the same range)
---
* Difficulty budget is split between Toughness, Complexity and Error Punishment Severity in a triple constraint triangle.
---
* Player attributes from gear or levels are not accounted for in the tuning inside a horizontal tier, while effects gained from gear, effects gained from additional abilities learned after leveling and effects gained from feats gained from other content inside the tier is accounted for.
---
* Player growth while featuring some attribute based growth from rewards, is usually based more around special effects from items, traits and emergent interactions from multiple rewards but limited in scale of the growth so to not place a fully cleared player on effectively a tier entirely "above" someone at early/mid progression across a horizontal tier.
---
* Content is beatable based on finding the best use options such as strats, group composition and gear/effects from adjacent content. There is typically a attribute floor for content, but this is usually serving as a filter for pre-endgame players who wonder into endgame content by accident or in the case of holy trinity mmos, to necessitate a certain ratio of classes in a group.
---
**Attributes of Vertical Progression**
---
* Difficulty budget for content is tuned around a curve of target values (or a curve of multiple ranges for multi boss content)
---
* Player attributes from gear or levels are accounted for in tuning the difficulty budget, but with a bias towards affecting toughness more meaningfully than Complexity or Error Punishment Severity.
---
* Player growth is primarily focused around attribute increases from rewards, but effect focused rewards and growth do exist but in a much more minor capacity. (Obviously thoerycrafting does identify optimal combinations leading to BiS lists favouring some rewards for their effects, but this falls out the scope of the intended design and is more players optimising efficiency within the constraints of a system in a game)
---
* Content is beatable based primarially on a vertical growth of power, with content previously challenging becoming trivial as a player grows and content previously nigh impossible, becoming reasonable. Strats, Group compositions and gear/feat effects from adjacent content provide benefit but never a total substitute for the effective attribute floor.
---
So with those two terms defined, you're probably noticing that these two things share a lot more in common than people tend to think, or that that they meant something else.
---
I mentioned earlier that Vertical and Horizontal progression are often misused as terms. What most people mean when they talk about Vertical or Horizontal progression is usually either **Gated vs Ungated**, **Single Branch vs Multi Branch** or **Timed Relevancy vs Evergreen**. Typically an MMO's approach to content is formed from a combination of these things, rather than simply "Vertical or Horizontal".
---
* **Gated** \- *Gated content or Gated progression means that content requires a thing in order to be accessed or to be possible. This can be an amount of stats from gear from specific places or a grind with a specifically tuned capped progress rate, it can be a mechanic thats unsurviveable without some special effect from a trait or piece of gear in prior content, it can be a difficulty mode that is locked without clearing a previous one or it can simply be an DB flag that is flipped from 0 to 1 on meeting attunement requirements that involve a previous piece of content.*
---
* **Ungated** \- *Ungated content or Ungated progression means that content can be freely accessed and a player of reasonable skill level in the target range of players can feasibly clear the content without being required to visit prior content. Content isn't ungated just because joe average walks into Naxx in D2 and is technically in the instance lying face down on the floor while the other 39 kill KT, nor is content ungated because a group of 40 of the top 20% of the raiding community manage to clear a raid despite being geared below what the content was designed with in mind. It specifically refers to how content is accesible and feasible for the average player in the target region of the player distribution curve, doing content under the modal circumstances, without having being required to do older content to make the content possible. Bit of a lengthy one there I know, but skill floor and skill ceiling is something that a lot of people tend to either not be aware of or take for granted when they're closer to the ceiling than the average player, so wanted to be precise.*
---
* ***Single Branch*** *- Single Branch in terms of content or progression means that the most meaningful and obvious player power growth is intended to be derived from a single type of content. This branch is either released in full at launch or is the primary focus of content updates over the lifecycle of an MMO or within a single expansion. It should be noted that side content may also offer progression and limited growth of a player outside the main branch, but are intended as additional content for players instead of alternatives to the intended single branch and so provide player growth at a either a vastly inferior rate, reach an effective cap sooner or simply recieve little or no post-launch support or development focus. Single branch is an older design approach that most MMOs have long abandoned on account of the difficulty of managing a content pipeline that keeps all sub-types of players satisfied enough without any one group becoming resentful or feeling ignored by the game.*
---
* ***Multi Branch*** *- Multi Branch in terms of content or progression means that meaningful and obvious player growth can be acquired from different branches of content each providing either the same gear, equivalent gear or drops gear that offers effective equal returns within the confines of the intended skill floor and skill ceiling for the branch against gear from branches "above" the branch. This is the most common design approach in modern MMOs, but the way in which it is implemented varies between them, each implementation having it's own pros, cons and unique issues they add to their games as well as differing approaches on throttling or capping progression in given branches in order to mitigate against a branch becoming more valuable for progression in another branch than that branch itself.*
---
* ***Timed Relevancy*** *- Timed Relevancy refers to content having a literal or effective lifespan attached to it. Content with timed relevancy is generally released with a pre-defined amount of time to live attached to it. This can be done explicitly, by making content inaccessible, having it's loot drops become unobtainable or have content of one type repurposed upon expiry into content of a "lower" type. This can also be done indirectly, by having it's loot drops become obtainable outside the content after time, content of equivalent or greater value be added to a game in new content that is either easier or accessible and feasible without having to do said content or simply increasing the level cap and/or adding new lands with new max level gear so it becomes less attractive on account of stat scaling. Time-limited achievements, titles and mounts also arguably add this but cannot make content time relevant alone.*
---
* ***Evergreen*** \- *Evergreen refers to making content either always relevant as part of progression for a player, group or guild, or content that is immune to becoming obselete by being designed as such that it exists outside the typical bounds of the progression treadmill as either max level but not endgame content, or post-endgame content. In Everquest-like MMOs, Content can be psuedo-evergreen if it is designed to be considered always relevant as part of an individual or group's progression within an expansion's endgame content. This kind of psuedo-evergeen state is how old WoW's raid content worked, to a point. Evergreen PvE raid content is generally very rare in MMOs with most evergreen raid content being psuedo-evergreen instead. One example of evergreen raid content would be Ultimate raids in FFXIV which cannot be overgeared, cannot be overleveled, but also are post-endgame and cannot be entered without being BiS to begin with and provide no reward for completion besides a title, weapon skin and bragging rights. Mage Tower in legion was also evergreen PvE content, but WoW hasn't had true evergreen PvE raid content.*
---
Ok, so now that that's all defined, lets make it a bit easier to digest by defining what old WoW and modern WoW are to give you an idea of what we're working with here
---
* Old WoW (vanilla -&gt; Cataclysm, with MoP being a kind of mid-transition xpac) is an ***Everquest-like MMO with a (Psuedo)Evergreen Single Gated Branch of Vertically Progressed Horizontal Tiers***
---
* Modern WoW (\~MoP -&gt; BfA) is it's own type of MMO with ***Time Relevant Multi Ungated Branches of Horizontally Progressed Content w/ a Time Relevant Gated sub-branch of Vertically Progressed raid content***
---
The road leaving the bulwark into WPL or the road from Camp Mojo to DM are the usual alliance rogue hangs.
---
Ahm. But they changed something. They made servers with huge capacity.
---
How long did the run take?
---
Just make a macro that says "no homo" every time you cast.
---
People riding to Hinterlands in the late 40’s / early 50’s
---
Blame it on the massive cowards who left
---
Another part of the Knocked Loose crew here, enjoying it a lot more than Skeram.   PvP is small skirmishes instead of of giant zergs, you can actually farm things in the world, and because the pop is much lower, people are generally nicer and more likely to be friendly because rep matters again!    This is the experience I wanted.
---
So if you did read what precedes that line above, you probably noticed it looks like WoW swapped from one type to the complete opposite, or rather kind of split itself. That's because it kind of had to.
---
So right now casual player, hardcore player, once upon a time top tier raider who is too old for that life anymore, etc... it doesn't matter. Anyone can raid right now. You max level? Cool. Made at least some effort for your pre-BiS? Sweet. You can probably pug your way through MC and Ony. Maybe even put out some feelers and find a raid guild and get that sweet sweet quick and clean weekly kill and spend the rest of your week lazing around watching netflix.
---
Right now there only is one tier of content, it's a vertical system, but theres only one rung on the ladder so it doesn't matter how much time you have to prep, what you have to do to catch up etc, its all stuff that can be done quickly, slowly, or not at all and you can find your feet.
---
However, this was also true in vanilla. This worked great at first too, not a problem. Sure some people decked out in raid epics could curb stomp you because they'd done content and you hadn't, but you could go do it whenever, no biggie.
---
Until....another tier gets added. Now it gets a little harder to get into raiding if you haven't yet. Now you need to pug the content that's no longer needed for people who already did it and farmed it, so while groups might still exist, they're not going to be in as high number and of what groups there are running, you need to find either a group of people doing the content new or find a group of people who are fine giving a spot to you instead of that sweet dps who's got a mix of T1 and T2 (I know, just put down the pitchforks, I know BiS wouldnt be that) but just can never get lucky on that T2 piece from MC. Chances are you aren't going to get it, and you can just forget about it as soon as AQ comes out, never mind even thinking about Naxx.
---
I guess you could join a guild? That will work. Yeah join a raiding guild. You apply to the best raid guild on your server and you either end up recruited as a trial, put into Raid Group C one night with a Raid Leader who clearly wishes he was raiding relevant content tonight instead of trialing a bunch of newbies in Molten Core then either accepted and benched, never to see raid content again or rejected. If its the former, well you'll get subbed in eventually and if you're ready to show your potential when that chance comes, maybe you'll get a spot, or more likely if you did get your first choice guild they're probably going to split raid and make sure the benched roster is being actively geared. If its the latter though, which is more likely, you're either going to apply to join a more middle of the road raiding guild that wants to live out that vanilla raider dream, but takes themselves way too seriously and makes raiding just a horrible negative experience and you burn out, or you get benched and this time this guild doesn't understand why they should maybe not funnel all their gear onto the main team and leave the bench loot and content starved.
---
This goes on for half a tier, you become increasingly jaded and frustrated about it and you end up guild hopping, trying to find that unicorn guild that is willing to take you in and get you caught up. But you find more and more your whispers are replied to with "Sorry man, we're currently progging X and working to get ready for AQ when it drops, we don't really have the time to spare to help you get caught up right now but we'd love to have you come bench for us and join this new raid team we're building once we get enough" at this point, you're exhausted of this and it's been ruining the game for you for a while. You notice you're logging in and sitting outside the SW or Org AH every night, grinding the same old dungeons, joining pug raid groups that get nowhere or farming BGs for hours on end. You see your friends who leveled faster than you at launch, every night, inside MC, OL, BWL and it eats at you. You feel bad about it, but you can feel yourself starting to resent them and other raiders too. You don't like it and you unsub. You need a break.
---
You come back a few months later, you had some friend tell you how he's in a guild that's pretty tight with raiding. They got everything on farm and are looking for some new people to raid. You try not to get your hopes up and thank your friend anyway but tell him how far behind you are. He says its not a problem and they've been spending raid nights running teams for groups of newbies to get them ready for Naxx thats coming out later. You grab your chicken tendies and your mum's credit card and resub.
---
This is it, you're about to get to experience all the cool stuff you heard about and be a big bad classic raider. You're practically screaming at the install bar, you can't wait to finally get into some content and get some big shoulders for your orc. You'd given up but you've gotten yet another chance to get lost in classic. You get online, you /w your friend and the guild invite comes a few minutes later. You join their discord, everyones really friendly and you quickly settle in. They start running you through content, get you some BoEs, before you know it you're running AQ40 nightly. You couldn't be happier and Naxx is right around the corner and this time you're here from the start.
---
Its a month later and guildies who had unsubbed before you joined are trickling back in. Surprisingly a lot of them are tanks, they'd been geared pretty early during the previous tier since it was considered important to prog by the raid lead. Either way they're around, friendly enough, but you can tell they're a little lost on all the new people and some people they'd hoped to see no longer being around. But hey, you're all running naxx soon this will be great!
---
Launch day, naxx drops, you're online right on time and ready with your consumables and a youtube playlist of old PoVs from 2006 to keep you right. Prog goes alright, sure some ups and downs, but prog is messy thats normal, you don't get server first but you were never gunning for that anyway. A few people are a bit disapointed but hey you're all having fun.
---
A week passes, its raid night and your alarm just goes off, you get up sit down and get on discord.
---
Raid channel is empty.
---
You see some people in voice in general so poke and ask when raid is. "Lol, never. 2 of our tanks got poached for some other guild on four horsemen". Your heart sinks. Poached? Really? Who would even do that. That's horrible! Well you're online anyway you may as well grind some rep, run some dungeons, make some gold. Its frustrating but it'll be fine.
---
Another week passes and that raid team is effectively dead. Half the team jumped to another raid guild, one ahead in prog and they're working on KT now. The raid lead breaks the news that hes taking a break from WoW after everything, it just crushed him. He drops from voice and its just you and a few others left in voice, you talk about it for a while, share your frustrations, eventually its just you left.
---
By the next week, you're back to your non raiding life in game. You don't mind though. Theres an expansion coming soon, the burning crusade its called and they're going to add a new planet, outland. You don't really feel worried about not catching the raid train now, you've got stuff to do before the next xpac and besides, you heard outland is going to be like twice the size of azeroth with so much stuff to do. You're confident you'll have plenty to do to keep you having fun anyway without raiding...
---
TLDR: The problems that made raiding near inaccessible for casuals started *after* multiple tiers dropped, not during tier 1 but the fundemental issues that lead to that becoming an issue are present in the game right now, just there's only one rung on the ladder, so it's not surfacing. The issue was in the amount of time and effort investment needed to gear up and attune a fresh newbie, not that it was somehow difficult for casuals. It came to its head in TBC specifically though and that's where the divide in western MMO audiences really sprung up with the whole "Casuals always whining about needing free stuff" and "God toxic elitists act like this game is just for them" as well as the demonisation of the term "Casual" really caught on. So yeah, 3 hours and done with raids and easy to get into raids is the norm right now, but we need to see if history is going to repeat itself or go differently this time and we're honestly going to have no idea there until we see how things play out once vertical progression starts showing up in raid tiers.
---
You 100% could. They lowered draw distance because of their poopy servers.
---
PvP gear is actually *very* well optimized stat wise and perfect for hybrid classes if they don't want to heal/tank compared to raid gear, but I still don't think the time commitment is "worth" it
---
I don't know of anyone who got R14 in vanilla who wasn't sick of PvP by the end of it, a bunch quit at R13
---
dodge from an equal level mob is a flat 5%. Youre trading a near 1.5 damage attack (hs) for a 2.5% chance for a crit and 2.5% chance for what is basically a normal white hit.
---
I havent seen any math but I cant possibly understand how people could think this is better? Even 3 stacks of sunder I'm still only averaging the same amount of extra damage as if I had just heroic striked once, let alone 3 times.
---
“I shouldn’t have to read for 30 seconds, please spoon feed me”
---
No that's how gearing works.  You're acting like people are rolling on upgrades out of spite or something, people are just rolling on upgrades because they're better than what they have equipped
---
Absolutely agree. There's no reason for you to not roll on an upgrade that just also happens to be another classes BiS. The examples in OP are just some misinformed player that doesn't fully understand stats, has nothing to do with taking someone's BiS items.
---
You do know that senior designer pantaloons are not bis right?
---
Well yeah you are just a bit behind lol
---
&gt; I would love to see the face of people who think their missing thousands of rank points because of a bug realize that it’s working like intended and it actually takes 3 months of playing WoW like it’s your job to reach r14.
---
Only if you want to be the first to reach R14.
---
It gets easier once the super no-lifers get R14 and stop playing as much. I am aiming for Rank 9ish over the next few months, then push harder once people drop off.
---
:(
---
Yeah there wasn’t 6 horde there from 6-9pm server yesterday at all.  Ally only.
---
Has I known it would be like it is now I would have hit 60 before phase 2.
---
As things stand now the game is not worth playing until phase 3 drops.
---
The systematic roaming of level 50 zones to kill innocent questing players for honor  is NOT how things were in 2005.
---
I ran into a similar issue,however theres nothing from deadmines that wont get replaced and way better xp out in the world.
---
Alot of people dont even know what bis means or care for it at all. Honestly you should blame blizzard for not implementing class restrictions on all gear, something all modern mmos have. And yes, wow classic isnt modern but thats kinda on you for paying for it. 
---
The itemization is ridiculous so you cant really blame others for thinking a certain way. Hell, if i was a warlock i would think +healing meant more life with drain life
---
Also asking EVERYONE to research their bis is kind of a ridiculous statement. Some people play to play, if they see something good or shiny they roll on it. If it's better for someone else in the group....who really cares? Strangers literally have no value to me
---
Now if you are in a guild thats a while nother story
---
Oh yeah post DM they are not
---
Dumb alliance. Cant pvp worth a shit and cant build a safe city for their own people.
---
Lok tar mother fuckers
---
See? Shit is random as fuck.
---
Feral druids represent!!
---
How does it change in aq and naxx?
---
If its an upgrade, roll. If its better for a stranger but still an upgrade, roll unless you want to be nice
---
Self satisfaction? Why climb Mt Everest? You don’t get anything beneficial from doing so, lots of people die on the way up, and you’re generally miserable while doing it. 
---
But people do it anyways so they can prove to themselves they can do it, and brag to others that might care. Sure you have to no-life to get to rank 14, but then again you have to “no life” to dedicate yourself to anything strenuous
---
A person leaving a situation that is very against their favor is not a coward, he is smart. Only an idiot or a masochist would accept such playing conditions. Failing to recognise that is your fault.
---
I'm talking specifically about the griefing at instance entrances. Also, those figures don't hold up for US servers, and the metric you're using does not reflect anything about the concentration of people near these entrances.
---
Perhaps I should have said, "7x-10x more people at the instances as well". There is no reasonable way to argue that what is seen on servers today is any way comparable to what was seen back then.
---
/moo
---
Depending on the server, I think they’re safe to start leveling now. I just hit 31 on my shaman and have been ganked maybe one time. 
---
I’m on incendius which is pretty even for faction splits.
---
Looks like draw distance is (almost) the same as hunter tracking distance, and targeting distance, it's not much but it's consistent this way
---
Population is what's wrong with this Game
---
The world just can't handle that many players at once
---
Fury prot. You’re welcome
---
Read the other replies, also think a little if you have any clue on what transcended prior to launch and during the initial 2 weeks post launch.
---
Zoomers are ruining the game
---
It is the casual faction, after all
---
yeah we could have cleared it all but we decided to go for ony before she reset, did ony again today and then off to MC
---
Do elemental sharpening stones work on druids or hunters?
---
It's a sad state of affairs.
---
Well you are free to not give a sh*t about your fellow puggers
---
Hey guys...
---
&gt;!You think you do, but you don’t.!&lt;
---
Ally whine on reddit, they get called out for whining. Now they're doing the same thing the potato horde have been doing for weeks and alas, now you horde are whining about them doing it. Fresher lulz have never been had.
---
This is all a bunch of unnecessary bullshit.  The addon calculates an estimate.  The client could do the exact same thing the addon does, which obviates all your rambling since none of your arguments apply to that scenario.
---
Draw distance is not a client variable, it's a server variable. It's a setting that dictates how far away you can see players/NPCs out in the world, before they fade out/disappear.
---
Lmao, if you don't like it, go play PvE realm.
---
It is hilarious that almost everyone with this mentality is either a mage or a rogue.
---
I’ve had plenty of great random 5 mans. How are you supposed to know they’re bad before they show it? I don’t have a bunch of friends sitting around 24/7 to go into a dungeon with me.
---
It's ok at low lvls
---
As a Horde player who prefers world PvP, I would love that.  I could stick to ganking for ranks.
---
Ironically, the people who would hate it are the Alliance players who would be even more outnumbered in the open world.
---
Can you tough it out a week and see?  Start an alt or something.  When BGs come out, the world is going to really die down because all the honor people want to grind honor (and BGs are way better).
---
So replying to a comment saying iam the the guy I'm talking about that I'm not the guy his talking about makes me a selfish self promoter? Wow people's logic... Wow..
---
I mean it works, but is it more beneficial no. That 2-3 extra seconds you save from not swapping is more beneficial.
---
Switching weapons causes global cooldown, so it wont be but so fast.
---
I like the new water and shadows more so I play on 7.started with 3, but now with 7 I never looked back. I know nostalgia and all that with point shadows and the old water, but... It looks more realistic with real shadows and the new water. And I like what makes the game more realistic to me.
---
Have fun farming your honour on this new PVE server
---
[Missing Tradeskills](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/missing-tradeskills-list)
---
I like to imagine these "go to retail" guys as people who have never actually played vanilla before, but they feel really cool saying it. Like they started in WoD or Cata but they're "die hard classic bois" because "retail is lame" LOL
---
It’s called World of WARcraft for a reason.
---
Did it in vanilla, can confirm.
---
Org, valley of spirits where mages port in
---
Nope you didn't at all, and right back at you! Thankfully there's enough folks still playing that both styles and mentalities are able to find a group of people with similar attitudes to enjoy the game with! 
---
Hope classic continues to treat you well, it's been mostly great so far!
---
This is when you level a second 60, and maybe even a third.
---
Parry is nice because it resets your main hand swing timer immediately, allowing you to requeue heroic strike again or follow up immediately with a regular mainhand hit. It indirectly builds alot of rage which translates to threat as a result, while also providing mitigation.
---
Wait you mean I need to think?
---
How is 10-20 hours a week not casual? What do you call people doing 40+ hours a week? 
---
It's an MMO, time&gt;skill and plenty of people put in way more than 20 hours a week. At my main job I put in ~40 hours a week plus I do consulting for ~10 hours a week. I'm still easily hitting 10+ hours of WoW a week. Before I started working and having a family, I was easily able to put in way more time.
---
"Why run away from a 40v5"
---
There is no point. It is an elaborate free lootbox opening simulator.
---
hahahAHAHAHAH
---
Only 6? I'll trade you, there's usually a raid group of 10-20 there every night for hours.
---
This is the one directly up the ramp. Have you asked the one on the other side AND upper floor? Guess not. See, people seem to not even know the second one up there.
---
Phase 2 has been a fucking disaster for the "mental health" of the servers. Look at this subreddit. The toxicity between players of each faction is just insane, and not in a healthy fun way. Realms are dying. 
---
Even the diehard rankers hate the world pvp meta (can confirm bc i'm one of them, standing 13 on my realm last week.)  
---
I'm kinda staggered by how much of a fucking shitshow its been.
---
What is Blizzard even hoping to achieve with this?  At best, it guarantees that a server like Flamelash will be pseudo PvE and at worse it creates an imbalance on *another* PvP server.
---
They could have at least limited the damage by only letting them transfer to a PvE server rather than spreading the damage
---
Make the estimation client side then.
---
So you only have to track one or two character's kills.
---
They don't work for druids, assuming you mean shapeshifting, not sure why they wouldn't work for hunters though. Also not sure why you'd go melee hunter, but you do you.
---
what a pointless comment
---
Not really an answer, but if you have about a week's worth of patience the situation in the world should get a lot better after tuesday when BGs come out.
---
That’s not draw distance, it’s an entirely different concept
---
There are two on the upper floor.
---
Said before but as an ally really enjoying ashbringer atm after re rolling there
---
You sound like a sadistic d-bag who needs to check themselves
---
Just remember these numbers are a rough estimate based on Warcraft raid logs and not a true representation of the population as not everyone raids or logs their raids.
---
&gt; The addon uses your computing power not Blizzards.
---
And the client could do the exact same thing.
---
&gt; And Blizzard is certainly not trusting the result that your computer calculates, so you sending them the correct result is not feasible.
---
Who the fuck asked for this?  Or are you inventing fictional arguments so that you can be a contrarian?  The client gives an estimate now.  It could keep doing the same thing, except now simply keep track of kill repetitions to account for diminishing returns in the **ESTIMATE**.  The *actual* honor would then continue to be calculated as it is now.
---
&gt; So Blizzard is only sending you an estimate. When the servers don't suffer from heavy load (in the night) they use that "free time" to properly calculate the honor.
---
Yes, this is exactly what would continue to happen under my suggestion.
---
You seem pretty surprised to have been displayed a tip. Maybe go ahead and uncheck “display tips”. Hopefully this will rid your screen of tips, and potentially if we are all lucky, rid us of tipsout.
---
Imagine being a brand new player, with no vanilla experience, rolling Alliance on this server.
---
its that saying, sometyhing like your freedom ends when it starts to hurt other people. like yeah its a free country, but you aren't free to spit in peoples faces simply because it brings you joy. there are others that play the game.
---
I play alliance and I think its doing just fine on mograine. Just brd is completely lost all the time.
---
***"The modern player has changed. People don't play games the same way they did it in 2003. The methods are refined, content has been explored, it's all about efficiency now."***
---
Most people want "no changes" because there is no stopping place one you start changing shit. Within two years, Classic will be exactly like retail, because people will want this or that changed. "Ahh but it is just ONE more thing they need to change". At the end of the day, you are left with a completely different game. Much safer to just say "No Changes".
---
I know a game that might interest you. WoW Battle for Azeroth. Tailored specifically to the modern fucking player. We wanted Classic because it is NOT tailored to the modern player. What a fucking shitpost.
---
With the sub cost, it's a job you're paying Blizz for!
---
I think the situation got much worse when server transfers opened and weren't faction-specific. On a server with &gt;60% horde(e.g. Stalagg), a ton of alliance players switched and now the ratio is even worse (~75% horde for Stalagg). The server transfers were poorly handled and made the problem much worse, though they had the potential to improve the issue.
---
Our raid has a Ret Pally and a Boomkin, they're like our mascots!
---
Thank you sensei, oh wise one. For explaining everything. 
---
The really facisnating part about all this I think. Is that if you have VR right now and do those online chats, etc. It seems to be the same as the original 2004 WoW. People are just excited to be there, talk to each other like they are standing in the room. Move around, etc. It's all new and feels cool.
---
VR is the new frontier, I want to play WoW in VR.
---
Awesome server. I am allianz side.
---
If you join their server with a character, and they are on your friend's list, you should see their character name on the friend's pane.  Otherwise it just says wow classic.
---
This is basic stuff, not min maxing...
---
How many people can reach 14 a week, though?
---
Back in the day, it was a commitment, the only way to do it was one specific PVP team, which advanced one person at a time. If there were an easier way to get rank 14, we would have been producing multiple grand marshalls a week. As it was, some rando rank 10 having a great week could make it so that nobody hit 14 that week.
---
I am wondering if BGs will actually make a meaningful difference, if it will then I should stay, I have 15 hours in my warlock and a hell of a lot more in my warrior. I am just worried that BGs won't be the answer we are all looking for
---
I've been using it, but I just manually install all of my add-ons. I can't remember where I got it, but I do remember having difficulty finding it but one of the guys in my guild had it for classic and sent it my way. I know that doesn't help much, but at least it's something lol
---
I agree with you but the original vanilla experience is impossible to recreate now.  Of course it’s not the same. That would have been an unrealistic expectation.
---
Nothing wrong with #NoChanges
---
I'm actually one of the people who loved this in vanilla, and predicted how how terribly bitchy people would be when they got what they asked for.
---
However, I'm enjoying it. NoChanges is just fine, because this is how it was back in the day. Instead of 20 guilds calling the entrance, it was 4 or 5, enough to cause the same amount of griefing.
---
But that's half the fun of a PvP realm. Brd and MC were always camped, flight paths were always camped, and entire raids would storm towns and cities. So this cycle of bitching is nothing new.
---
I still maintain that people need to suck it up or move on. This shit is fun.
---
Sorry but... Do you honestly try to convince people that gank kill people that are 5-10 levels beneath them?
---
You can't kill him that fast (21 seconds) without full world buffs.  The log that was linked above is probably in the top 3% in terms of speed.  Their full MC clear took 45 minutes, which is probably in the top 75 guilds on warcraft logs on classic.  And there are ~4500 guilds with logs uploaded.
---
This is my much more average guilds kill (90-100 minute MC clears, we are not doing any skips at the moment tho, could probably cut down ~15 minutes easy), and our only world buff was Rallying Cry of Dragonslayer.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/rDyYTgW1AJ9zPwFk#fight=50
---
Melee prepot 1 greater arcane, usually like 2 trash packs before the boss, then pop a second one in the fight.  Unfortunately, the asshole did one last AE at like 2% that killed 4 people lmao.
---
Yeah. Back in vanilla we were the only premade that didn't raid (all other premades also raided 3+ days / week). So we could have those long &amp; tight matches. And we had instant join (Alliance) [some old screens](https://i.imgur.com/aPHwURr.png).
---
we kill

&gt; *"brainless BGs where there are no stakes from dying"*
---
WoW does not have risk vs reward with regards to PvP, regardless of consensuality. If it did - ie if you die you drop everything you've been farming etc - I'd be ganking literally 24/7 and farming the farmers for their stuff and it would take on its own form of meta involving strategy via successful farmers, their anti-gank guards, and PK squads.
---
There is nothing to be gained from the current zergfest, there is no brain being used, nothing to learn if you are the zergling, in fact it likely encourages garbage habits in your playstyle to go out and bang people 10v1 and waste your own time for literally trivial amount of honor.
---
The current clowncar ganksquad shit going down since honor rollout (which could've been easily solved by waiting for BGs) is literally the most meaningless thing you can do, since you gain nothing at all of actual use in game besides honor... and considering that the honor you will get from plowing through BGs with other good experienced vanilla players will be about an order of magnitude greater than any ganksquad or FM camp will get you currently in game, yeah, that shit is literally brainless.
---
The only thing to be gained from World PvP is Kazzak and Azuregos at the moment, and those flash-in-the-pan 5v5s etc that you spend an hour looking for during prime time while avoiding 20 man jokewagons.
---
brainless... dude some of us spent 15 yrs elevating WSG and AB, don't pretend like a dozen trashbags swinging on a level 53 watching a movie playing with one hand is anything but the definition of brainless.
---
Paid transfers before the end of Q4 - 2019 earnings will see a boost.

Ya, I'd reroll. We on PVE Servers are having a blast! :D
---
It's not the alliance trinket, its that different classes trinkets work on different debuffs.  https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_trinket

Although pally is fear stun polly, your trinket should work.

&gt; Reroll for alliance **on your own server**, make a difference
---
Night elves, specifically female night elf hunters. 
---
any person who identifies with a female night elf (especially the fat neck beards) literally deserves to die
---
I just find fights where the other person doesn't really mind dying, like duels and bgs to be incredibly dull.  Give me a guy out in the wild that's trying to complete a quest (or attacking me when I'm trying to complete one) any day over a duel outside the city gates.
---
He should die in 30 seconds or less if you have ony head/rend. One GAPP and one restorative is sufficient.
---
We're supposed to care about random puggers nowadays?
---
I'm starting to suspect you're playing a different game than I am.

I honestly don't know what you guys were expecting when the honor system quite literally encourages the most toxic, unfun form of PvP. Like if I want to climb rank, I HAVE to go farm you guys, there's no alternative.
---
All you idiots whining about wpvp probably should've considered this before rolling PvP. This is how it is.
---
I play a undead mage so it gets rough trying to farm my lashers but I don’t get mad when I gotta corpse run cuz that’s the name of the game. Except for zealott lol fuck that guy. I think I’m having a 1v1 then he always jumps in with a Druid friend.
---
Just the loot mostly.  I'm looking forward to BWL+ though, I never really got to do those in vanilla.
---
I haven't had an upgrade in a month so that's been a little annoying for me.
---
I've feared mobs on my warlock alt that have straight ran out of view distance and reset :/
---
Damn, I wish I valued my time as little as you do.
---
The obvious thing to do would be for horde to transfer to heartseeker. But none did.
---
It wasn’t like it is now. WoW classic is very toxic compared to how WoW actually was in 2005. People used to PvP in Hillsbrad, city gates and some other standard locations.
---
There was never a concept of teams of 60 players roaming around killing level 50 players wooo questing. It just didn’t happen.
---
Just in case the first sap wasn't enough.
---
It's easier to find low level dungeon groups in the zone the dungeon is in than in LFG. People don't want to spam the LFG channel for low level stuff. Not sure what region but you should be able to find a group during primetime.
---
Right now I'm on a race to out-parse and min-max my attempts. As someone else said, hanging in discord with my guildies is also a fun way for me to unwind from adult-life.
---
I’m on rattlegore and I see equal amounts of control in pvp areas from both factions always going back and forth.
---
No is whining about alliance doing it. Just funny seeing them brag about it, yuck it, while their brethren insist on spamming threads and shitty memes about their death runs.
---
Are we talking about the rock fury bracers?  Not sure it’s worth the 6 sp vs. 12 Int, 2, Stam, 8 armor to not just keep using Bracers of Arcane Accuracy from BWL.
---
It's been pretty bad in my experience but there have been times when Alliance controlled things
---
I'd buy gold if it wasn't illegal or whater lol. I heard the rate would be 10g for every 1$?  If that's the case I'd buy my epic mount just so I didn't have to farm it lol.
---

---
I have used this method as a Priest to force-proc Focused Casting from the Martyrdom talent as of 12/4/2019, so unless they patched it out today it should still be in.
---
I went taunt and anticipation personally. Improved revenge is functionally useless in my opinion, and shield wall is nice but I use recklessness far more often in raid environments, so shield wall was never a huge factor for me. 
---
It really comes down to personal preference, a lot of people will argue different points, but I think they're all viable depending on what you want to do. The only one that everyone agrees on is Improved Revenge is useless for raids (but a lot of people still bring it for dungeons).
---
Consumer brand loyalty is a toxic cancer on culture. Call a spade a spade, this game just isn’t good. Video games don’t have “problems that need addressing” they’re just bad. Bad design, bad infrastructure, bad things that can only be alleviated by a sequel aka a new game.
---
Some combinations are significantly better than others, too many to list here but check out the guides on wowhead or icyveins for the class you're interested in playing.
---
Nope. Just nope. If #NoChanges had actually been listened to the player caps for each realm would be around 3k players, not the massive mess we have now. That's a massive fundamental change they made to the game.
---
You’re comparing borderline crimes vs pvping in a contested zone on a PvP server. 
---
Bruh. Really. Is me killing you in searing gorge hurting you that much?
---
Ppl have done this before in vanilla so stop this stupid first , we cant first any .
---
Thanks for the compliment!
---
And if the user uses two clients or wipes their cache, they get exactly the same bitching and moaning, and it's harder to tell them how the estimates are off.
---
Heck you deserved that just for playing fem Dorf.
---
This. Noble87 has the best lore videos by far. Great sound, good editing, great research.
---
For two man, I'm not sure.   
---
For solo, mage - ZF farm I think, and for paladins SM farm.
---
You're welcome!
---
haha come on.. my ice block has a keybind. jeeeezzz
---
Yea if I had to wait to login every time I wanted to play I'd be unsubbing real quick lol.  I don't know what the solution is but that ain't it.  The same kind of wild faction imbalance plagued vanilla too which lead to dead servers and the need for cross realm play.
---
thank you, no changes just makes me think of all the boomers that hate blizzard just because its cool to hate blizzard.to the point they dont trust them with anything. like they didn't make legion
---
Another typical redditor
---
We get it, from the ton of other posts on the classicwow reddit front page about Flamelash.
---
If I were the horde on this server I’d transfer to the same damn server all the alliance did and make their jumping ship for nothing.
---
You're welcome! :) Glad you liked it!
---
Its currently shorter than it was in vanilla. There are blue posts explaining that. They *think* this creates a more classic experience because they assume people put the setting low to max performance. In truth not a single soul kept that setting low. We all maxed it out and lowered other graphics settings to get the game to run. Draw distance was NEVER sacrificed.
---
Of course all thats crap and they just cant deal with lag, but hey.
---
Loot is for the benefit of the guild.
---
They should have released a couple BGs before the Honor System so that those who want to do general PVP have a place to go to other than gank. So when honor system comes out they could do both real world and bgs
---
Sorry I couldn't hear you over the sound of the WOTF sound effect.
---
Thanks for that! :)
---
Are you on a small server? Is it off hours for your region?
---
I've spoken at length with nochangers about many of these issues that the game would face, but since they were fake vanilla players they insisted that it wouldn't be a problem.
---
That is directly related to honor per hour being higher in BGs than in world PvP.
---
yeah had some problems with the file format : /
---
the shaman that was rushed gear was a loot council member
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4984/skull-of-impending-doom
---
This trinket does puts a nasty dot on you, which will break any CC that breaks on damage (sap, blind, gouge, sheep, etc.). You can't use it while CCed, but you can use it then be relatively immune for the next 10 seconds.
---
Yeah yeah. Everyone all went horde in vanilla.  Too bad we actually played back then and they were by far the smaller faction. You even had game journalism saying the Horde sucked.
---
 [https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/02/wow-archivist-when-blizzard-hated-the-horde/](https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/02/wow-archivist-when-blizzard-hated-the-horde/) 
---
The fact is the vast majority of current Classic Horde were Alliance who rerolled and frontrunning clowns. I never said you were, but to act as if this isn't the case is you being delusional.
---
LOL at "attitude". Try getting every MC raid camped by 400 Horde, never having buffs like ony inside a raid, dying every time you take a flightpath. Again that is BLIZZARD's fault by screwing up even more by not adding BG's at honor launch. All so that some horrible ranged could think they were good in a Tarren Mill lagfest that they got sick of in a week. 
---
I'm going to laugh my ass off when you see the queue times on WSG.  Forget 60/40. It's more like 80/20 for people that will queue for that. The vast majority of queues are going to be from PVE dominated ally servers who don't give a darn about WSG. They want the offhands, rings and hunter ammo from AV. The only difference between the awful AV in current retail WoW and 1.12 is no resources. People will have MORE motivation to base rush though. You actually get good rewards in Vanilla in AV. 
---
Get it yet champ? The one BG you will even get in won't even have PVP after a week.
---
It's done for the loot so we can stand on the AH bridge in Ironforge and show off.
---
This is at least the second time you have posted this and you don't provide context.  Cool, they have both been to the same amount of raids.
---
This doesn't say other shit like, does one do things other than show up for the raids?  Do they help other people in the guild?  Do they farm mats for people?
---
More importantly, does the other shaman have more t1 but simply isn't using it because it isn't better than a collection of unles you have the full set anyway.  The context can be much different than one guy is 8/8 vs the other person wearing 1 piece but potentially having more but not wearing them.
---
Unless you are making some sort of actual accusation what is the point?
---
Not most, all of them
---
I use them all the time currently in raiding, especially on Phase 3 Onyxia. For other fights I primarily use it for DPS, since I'm OT, but all warriors can be using them now in raids if they're wanting to eke out every tiny bit of performance.
---
Alliance : It's unplayable!
---
Horde : Leave if you're not happy!
---
*Alliance leaves*
---
Horde : *Surprised Pikachu*
---
lol you are so dense.. dunno why I reply.. xD
---
I fucking love sulfuras and I feel like it’s quickly becoming known as one of the more balanced and solid servers.   
---
If you’re out there, fuck you eviscerate.
---
Do you know what blanket generalizations are and how they are applicable?
---
this is the kind of content i’d like to see more of on this sub, thanks for sharing!
---
Agreed. The min/max grind mentality is dumb. So you spent days farming some items with slightly better stats than what you had so that you can do a bit more damage out of a group of 40 so that you can hopefully got a purple but probably not.  
---
That’s why I love PvP. It’s mostly about skill and having some good trinkets so long as your gear is decent (tho as a warrior I really need a good weapon). 
---
Can’t wait for BGs since it’s not about the grind for me. I’ll get my gear slowly and they will be fun incremental upgrades.
---
Do ppl enjoy molten bore? no.  Do ppl enjoy raiding with their guild mates?  yes.  The social aspect is what draws people to the game.  If you don't have a good social network in the game, you will eventually leave for your 3 man apex team, or your 20 man mythic guild in retail, or your fellow Minecraft server players that you enjoy gaming with.
---
Honestly you'd probably be better served just trying to abandon that notion of "fairness" or "honor". 
---
They don't exist. People fight to win, period, and trying to change that is pretty futile.
---
he said SERVER first you mong
---
&gt;w EXACTLY what was going to happen and most of us even tried to warn you guys. That's why we are all laughing at you guys and sulking in your tears
---
Can you point out where these warnings were of death squads? We already know you're full of shit, but i'd love to see a post to backup your claim.
---
Sure, and we're both guilty of them. You post as if certain types of people  play one faction and certain types play another, so i obliged.
---
Are you eviscerate?
---
Hi, /u/Zerimar_1990

---
No crossrealm BGs. If the majority faction of a server wants to kill their servers, let them suffer the consequences.
---
Wow that’s ass.
---
So you blaim people who did not want changes? When the problem is the fact that these realms allows way more players than vanilla. Nice
---
&gt; Runescape players also trusted Jagex to make changes to Oldschool Runescape
---
uh, i wouldn't call making the devs poll the players for every major change trusting them...that's the exact opposite of trust
---
Part of me worries that PvP &gt; PvE transfers won't be happening cause they know that pretty much all alliance players will leave to abandon the server to the zerging horde.
---
Here is another pic of what's going on - https://i.imgur.com/oIPyPFE.png
---
Has this ever happened in another server in wow history?
---
Killing lower levels doesn't give you dishonor, it's just killing the civilian NPCs. The reason being that a ton of lower levels could easily kill a 60 if they worked together.
---
TBC prepatch I presume. If there'll ever be one.
---
Luckily I’m on a pretty balanced server, so both factions control different hotspots throughout the day. 
---
Though the horde generally holds black rock while the alliance always have WPL/EPL. The pvp is pretty fun in searing gorge though. Basically you just need to be in a group or you’re gonna get rolled lol
---
You have two ways of doing this. 
---
1. Pick a class and then go from there. 
---
2. Pick a race and go from that point.
---
What are you considering?
---
Thank you!!!
---
My favourite spot as a druid right now is DM east herb stealth runs. I tend to not have trouble getting there with stealth but that might be different on your server.
---
This sounds like a prisoner's dilemma.
---
Was thinking the same thing. Got a 46 human on Heartseeker which is basically a pve server unless you run into some hordes when you're solo questing/gathering, but I want to go Tauren and my 29 tauren is on Faerlina which I'm sure is still running with Alliance gank squads in the 40+ contested zones. Super tempted to play Mankrik server but then I'm giving up a collective 7.5 days /played on the first two characters
---
Bro kickball leagues are not hardcore. I played on one and we’d all show up and drink beer and bullshit. There was one team in the whole league who did take it seriously and they’d travel to other states to play kick ball and whatnot. They were hardcore and they were good but they were definitely an outlier.
---
To add on to what /u/Khalku said, you can then type "/who [character name]" (without quotes) to see the level, race, and class of the character, if that character is online. Unfortunately, I don't think there's any other way to look up someone's WoW characters given their battletag.
---
They probably will? BGs come out next week and then the amount of world pvp doesn't matter.
---
Thanks for that, I hope so :) Hope questing isn't too hard on you!
---
So it is, actually, ironic coming from the faction who has incessantly cried on this sub for the past month?
---
Kewl.
---
You may as well do the first boss as well if your doing that, he is easily soloable using the same method. He drops decent vendor loot and BIS bracers.
---
&gt;But once you start doing that, there's no obvious place to stop. There's always one more incremental change you can make that will make the game a little better.
---
I think OSRS have really done a good job at keeping to their original "philosophy" when it comes to design, there has been a few hiccups but the game is still really fucking good.
---
And blizzard implemented changes anyways, such as the layer system. Yes, it was good for launch, and it was probably the right decision and people accepted it. If they did something similar to maintain faction balance, I think people would have accepted too, especally looking back from what they have experienced now. They also increased the server cap (which I think is a good thing), but I think if they did that they also had to scale it and keep it in line with the faction balance.
---
My wish would have been if Blizz just looked at the private servers and how they were managed (community has been running vanilla for like at least 10 years), and really high qual servers since 2014/2015 ish that were super succesful. Those people love vanilla, and still made some changes to keep the game as good as it could be.
---
The guards multiplied a lot so [they evade them](https://i.imgur.com/EkZeu70.jpg) and still kill with impunity.  
---
How is that not an exploit?
---
I don't recommend going full prot. Yes you take less damage, but you also generate less threat and less damage. Going fury/prot feels better.
---
^ mana and damage are the limiting factors. I use rank 3 Heal when there isn’t much damage coming in/ for most dungeons. In raids greater heal rank 2 or rank 4 for tanks depending on the situation (I use shift to swap between them and it’s very intuitive) and flash heal rank 2 (I think) and rank 6 for raid damage. Flash heal is my go to raid heals since there are other healers and getting heals out ASAP tend to be more important, once you get comfortable with the encounters and can better predict damage you will start using slow heals more. Spell “priority” I would say is greater heal rank 2-&gt; flash heal rank 2-&gt;heal. But it’s entirely up to how much healing is needed and if the target will die before a big heal lands.
---
Lmao, Redrldge. that dude had so many problems. The shit he would post on LHC reddit was hilarious and pathetic.
---
Thanks for that!
---
Also its easy to say what loot you're looking for when grouping as to avoid and ignorant roll so at the least they can't say it was an accident.
---
&gt;xD
---
So what, the dude on the left has amazing gear as well and is more suited to a role of tank healer because his +healing is ultimately much better.
---
The guy with rushed T1 also means he'll skip on non-T1 pieces, so less competition.
---
I'm not sure if you're trying to say that loot council is a problem in any way, shape, or form, but this shitpost is not how you'll convince me.
---
Was a bit tricky to do, so I'm glad you liked it! ^^
---
Ahh fair enough. I was just thinking on an individual level. 
---
Ahh well... At least the shammy ZG trinket is still more useful than that joke of a Mage DM trinket lol
---
Right, gotta avoid improving the client because it will make things marginally more annoying for edge cases. Got it. Storing the variable in AppData would be too easy.
---
Seems you're more committed to feeling right than being right, bud.
---
Blacksmithing basically matches with enchanting though, due to weapon chains, counterweights (for druids), mithril spurs, and shield spikes. 
---
But in general, I agree with you completely. It's extremely difficult to break into blacksmithing right now.
---
I was unhappy with the very same carrot in retail. I quit in WoD but: do dailies, do garrison quests, do some pet battles, level 1 more farm alt for gearing raids... no thanks, I haven't got enough time for this.
---
Here I have grinded out my non-raid BiS then just go out to raid since it doesn't depend on me much what will I get for 1 raid lockout. Either it drops or it doesn't. Couple of hours a day get me enough gold to save for BWL hopefully in a form of lotuses and that's it.
---
I have always found it easier to rank to higher ranks on servers with much larger populations, there is more competition for sure but the way the system works there are also more spots available in the higher brackets.
---
Ok thanks, I was hoping to pick undead priest and turns out that works ok so imma stick with that, thanks for the help :)
---
Good luck finding dmW groups tho I’m still rocking the pantaloons lmao
---
Lock Priest is a strong duo levelling composition, but nothing will quite ever reach the absurdity that is Mage aoe grinding.
---
Regardless of the offset from Holy Nova healing you each GCD, any respectable number of elite mobs will kill you far quicker than you and your lock can kill them. The whole reason that Mage grinding works is because the mage theoretically doesn't have to get touched, and when they do they can simply ice block.
---
You can definitely grind non-elite packs (e.g.: the southsea pirate fortress, etc) very efficiently though.
---
I see the point flew right over your head.
---
I think we're done here.    
---
Edit: Breaking out the crayons so you don't leave the conversation confused.  
---
"Generalizing horde intelligence bad, generalizing alliance crying good"
---
Downvoted
---
A rank 14 60 isn't going to be able to solo 10 unranked 60s.
---
Healing efficiency and mana supply would be equal to each other if 100% of your mana is being used to heal,  which is obviously not the case when you take into account buffing, rezzing, and dispelling.  The larger mana pool is going to sustain you longer between drinking thus reducing downtime and increasing your character's efficiency.
---
That many — how many actually per your estimation?
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Back in '04 I used to play Ragnarok Online *hard*. That game makes the Classic grind look like Retail. At higher levels, you would genuinely have to grind for *hours* just to get **.1% XP**. Literally one tenth of one XP. Then you'd have this wonderful mechanic where, if you died, you'd lose 1% of your current XP bar.
---
You could lose *days* of progress just by dying one time.
---
So, what did we do? Well, dozens of us would sit outside the gates of the main city and just... talk. There was no general area chat, if memory serves, so you'd have to be pretty close to actually talk. So we'd all just sit there in little groups and talk. Hours would pass like this. We'd talk about items, we'd talk about where the hunt, we'd make fun of each other... it was a glorified chatroom.
---
But it worked, because it was 2004 and that's what we found fun.
---
They recently remade Ragnarok Online for the mobile, and it is a really faithful recreation with some modern elements. I played it for a few days and had to stop, because it just wasn't fun to me anymore. I can't spend hours killing Kobolds for slivers of XP and the rare occasional item.
---
WoW is the same: fifteen years ago we would all dick around outside cities and talk, we'd go explore this totally unknown world in our shiny new blue armor, and we'd sit around in /1 just doing whatever. That doesn't work today. It's 2019, we want games to be fun and interesting.
---
I often said everyone was just wearing rose tinted glasses, and I hope this makes everyone realize that. *No one* wants to play Classic WoW, we all just want to go back and feel that sense of wonder; that feeling of fucking around with your buddies, not a care in the world, going off to explore the world.
---
You're missing the point.  Anyone in a kickball league takes kickball more seriously than 99.99%+ of other people that have played.  You may not be "hardcore" in an absolute sense, but you're "hardcore" relative to all other people that have played kickball.
---
The same is true of vanilla.  MC really wasn't hard in any absolute sense.  But relative to what the majority of the playerbase was doing, being a raider in vanilla set you apart from everyone else as hardcore.
---
You guys read way too much into this shit in order to try to pick nits.  Get the fucking point and move on.  Forest for the god damn trees, guys.
---
Whitemane seems to be pretty balanced. There are times where I still get outnumbered as Horde but it also goes the other way around.
---
Server transfer my dude, or re roll the proper faction
---
Just go for 6 piece shadowcraft and skip truestrike.  6piece is better than any other combo of pre-bis, and if youre daggers it will beat out many raid gear setups.  (Ideal for daggers is 6pc ACLG and NS shoulders).
---
Jesus Fuck, I had no idea this was happening and now it's over.
---
Well there's your problem, the guy giving the directions is just a Warchef not a Warchief.
---
Most likely not, just putting it out there. :)
---
What's your reasoning there?
---
What server back in the day? I was on Lightbringer.
---
What is a good PvE server to roll on? I am NA East. I would like high pop because it's PvE so no worries about ganking etc
---
Some races have marginal bonuses over others for certain classes but unless you're a min/maxer the difference is minimal.
---
Pick a race/class that looks fun because you will be looking at the back of their head for many, many hours.
---
It really depends on what you're wanting to do. My guild in particular is trying to make sure we progress with several tanks early, so we've got 1 MT, 1 main OT (me), a feral druid OT, and 2 more warrior OT's, as well as two other DPS warriors who have plate gear and will get leftover tanking gear, but they are fury spec and are still able to get DPS gear as well. They'd only get tank gear once all other tanks have it. 
---
This is way more than is currently needed for any content, but it helps when doing split Ony, because we have at least two dedicated, geared tanks in each run, and it will definitely help in later phases, since we'll have people that have tanking experience/gear/talents that won't be trying to learn how to tank at the same time they're trying to learn the fights.
---
I love Tauren. For sure my favorite race. But i also love the Paladin class. I went alliance for classic and quit before 60. I'll let my memories of playing vanilla stay how they are.
---
So they turned the pvp server in to a pve server?
---
New phone, Rattle-who-dis?
---
Most moronic post of all time. Yeah, Blizz definitely made no changes when they ballooned the servers to 3-5x their intended player cap LMAO. How do people NOT see that this has a huge effect on every aspect of the game?
---
That is ridiculous! Is it common?
---
Also, even if you can stun a mob youre only keeping the tank from gaining rage
---
Classic also had other changes that got rolled back to make it as close to the 2004 game as feasible with modern technology. Losing a battle or two and winning the war.
---
You still haven't addressed their points, try again.
---
Earthfury was quite balanced until a few weeks ago and now is 65/35 alliance/horde and it’s noticeable. It’s not hopeless for horde but it’s now clearly an alliance dominated server which sucks because the first week or two of works pvp felt relatively even
---
Healing Stream is just a terrible totem, I would remove it from your bar.  Drop Searing before pull and if you are planning on setting up a camp (able to pull 2-3 mobs to your totems) then drop str and agi and mana spring totems.
---
You are getting close to SM farm level which you could in theory just pound the hell out of that place in your current spec and heal runs.
---
All he had to do was summon his pet or use the pvp trinket.
---
&gt; The decision people had to be alliance came with the tradeoff they are going to be outnumbered. It's amazing how none of these solutions involve anything which is possibly a tradeoff for the alliance.
---
I like how you're trying to present yourself as some reasonable neutral arbiter but in the end you don't want to give up any of your current advantages or inconvenience yourself. It's fine if the game is unplayable for Alliance players and they quit but I'm Horde and I don't you dare inconvenience me. 
---
The current situation isn't sustainable either, the people from minority faction will transfer or quit and that will lead to loss of subs for Blizzard and dead servers even for the majority faction.
---
I just cleared mc in a casual guild in 1h30min. We have one ret paladin he is pretty decently geared and has the obisdian edged blade weapon he does 170-190dps and basically dead last every fight.
---
Yea I completely agree with it. I can’t either. I just definitely remember some upheaval back in the day about it. PvE realms didn’t want the PvP dejects or some crap.
---
He's mad that you have facts.

Yep I am certain that won’t happen for the reason you mentioned. It will be paid only.

UD rogue cancels out the fishing. No one rolls UD rogue on pvp server with good intentions.
---
I don’t think i could play a warrior without tactical mastery? it’s like deleting 2/3 of your spells. i guess if you’re in raids where everybody just spams 1 or 2 buttons it’s ok, but you can’t do anything else with it. I don’t understand how this build is so popular.
---
  /r/comedycemetery
---
Agreed
---
Your alliance side rly should not be complaining about anything except for brm
---
 #nochanges isn't a rule, it's a fucking meme.
---
And I had a 60 rogue that was farming honor kill me 4 times yesterday... Then they stopped and would just run by after.
---
just in time
---
Higher realm populations --&gt; more raw currency + raw currency farm info
---
So people love honor, not wpvp
---
The 2 faction exclusive are both least popular at 6% is quite funny.
---
27
---
I play horde on Earthfury and from my perspective, the ratio is about 65-35% in favor of Alliance. Going to BRD is practically impossible, there's always at least 20 lvl 60 alliance just waiting there at all time. So many people i know have quit because of this.    
---
People camping inns and FP is a constant issue also. Nowhere is safe.    
---
But! Horde PVP guild have started to fight back, rallying whenever a zone is under attack so things might change soon.
---
First of all, I'm fine as alliance on firemaw, I'm not the one complaining.
---
Second, pretending that 40 man zerg groups have anything to do with skill whatsoever is ridiculous. Once a certain threshold of faction imbalance is reached, it's a natural consequence that most pvp encounters will be incredibly unfair. 
---
It's just sad that so many people flock to horde in vanilla, be it for the racials, or different reasons. In my opinion the game is more fun when the population is balanced.
---
I can't remember how it worked but back in vanilla I'm sure people tanked onyxia with voidwalkers
---
They do it in ways to make it harder for botters to figure out how they were detected.
---
In the long run it's a better strategy than banning any bot on sight, as you'll reveal exactly how you're detecting them, then the bot makers just work around that.
---
I mean... isn't PvP as bad as it is because of all the free server transfers? If people are forced to either 1. play on the server their on or 2. level a new toon to play with their friends / horde buddies, wouldn't that solve the massive inbalance we see on servers?
---
Osrs is filled with bots rofl.
---
There's a group of NE druids on Herod that camp the grom'gol zeppelin and tower every single day for many hours at a time. They don't ever fight level 60s, and will run away if they get counter-attacked by one.
---
Oof, that's lower than I thought. I'm doing 260 as a prot warrior, definitely thought paladin would at least be above that. Well, thanks for the frame of reference!
---
Not really, you can corpse-run into the instance
---
I would also like to see this - and I play on horde stalagg.  PvP isn't fun for anyone right now, but it's definitely way worse for the minority faction.
---
Someone is angry.
---
Herb if you want to track lotus timers, mining if you don't.
---
&gt;  Garr requires a handful 
---
Or warlocks.
---
I see a fellow Gilthoniel over there on the right :)
---
But I don’t take it seriously. Nor did half the other people. My buddy went hey wanna join a kickball league, it might be fun? So I joined. We didn’t practice, we just showed up and played a game which took about an hour once a week. We spent more time at the bar afterwards than we did playing.
---
You’re point is basically that by engaging in any activity you’re hardcore because the rest of the general population doesn’t engage in said activity. (Ive never seen anyone over the age of 10 play kickball outside of a league) Which I don’t agree with. Reading 1 book a year doesn’t make you a hardcore reader just because a significant portion of the population doesn’t read. I ran a 5k but that doesn’t make me a hardcore runner just because most people have never ran a race. 
---
Funny thing is I actually agree with your point about wow because your comparing wow player (raiders) to other wow players (casuals). I just don’t think it applies to kickball. Also, quit being so fucking salty, if you don’t want people to respond to you then don’t go voicing your opinion in a message board.
---
\&gt; Guy says game is outdated and inefficient
---
&gt; You see, the entire Honor system and PvP system of 2003 WoW is such an ill fit for a modern gaming setting. It's outdated and just inefficient 
---
\&gt; Guy signs up and plays for months anyway.
---
\&gt; Guy knows months in advance that pvp will be a shit show.
---
&gt; I actually remember very few people bringing this up a few times in the months before Classic release 
---
\&gt; Guy rolls on a pvp server and complains as if he didn't see this coming.
---
Maybe in tomorrow's version of this same blame game, the OP will take some responsibility for their own choices instead of blaming everyone else for their decision to sign up for an old game with ill fitted, inefficient, and outdated systems that they knew about beforehand. Maybe.
---
I just don't get it, the nostalrius servers (which I totally never played on) ,could handle way more players, didn't need layering and the view distance was far and still never lagged.
---
Has anyone seen anyone selling/buying Arcanite Dragonling on their servers? I really thought more people would be interested in a fun engineering trinket, especially with Phase 2 coming out, but so far I've been severely disappointed.
---
I remember this as well, im not sure if it was on vanilla or BC but I could see and /target anyone from anywhere inside a WSG for instance.
---
it is as reliable as a fart
---
27 players? Nice.
---
He ain’t wasting no time
---
Because you can't kill people.
---
Altough finding some dipshit who is stupid enough to be flagged, and stalking him until he gets in a bad situation to then kill him does sound a bit fun.
---
But that would be a rarity, vanilla without wpvp is not vanilla.
---
it’s not obvious to me that threat in fury/prot would be that much better than e.g. 17/34/0. does somebody have the math on that? if it’s just a couple of percent difference, who cares? last stand and shield block are both good, i know. but you could get more parry with fury/arms. maybe that mitigates it a bit? again would love to see how the percentages come out.
---
First, I am alliance.
---
Second, my solution isn't to do nothing.  I have started the best solution is sharding.  Minimizing the amount of people who get screwed.  Zones end up more evenly balanced so Alliance got get fucked and Horde can at least log on and go about their day.
---
These terrible decisions were also made in 2004 so yeah.
---
Horde lost at something? Time to cry and ticket a GM.
---
it will lower your dps due to the gcd
---
Those aren't stakes, when you cannot rake them in via winning said encounter.
---
They're just denials imposed on the other player, period. Oh wait, you actually need things in game still like ore or herbs for gold? Good luck in BGs.
---
Your second and third comments speak volumes about what you obviously don't know, which is fine, just a game after all, but explaining this to someone who's clueless is a waste of my time.
---
People always say Alliance does it too but there is NEVER any pics provided. Its just a fact that horde has more assholes per capita.
---
fairbanks is no bueno for alliance
---
Oh, i didn't realize the entire population thinks and acts just like you do! My mistake.
---
I tried this as a troll and holy crap I had so many issues with the reset points. Almost seems like it might be a lot easier as a gnome.
---
Great post. The blizzard did this blizzard did that, fix everything I don’t like but don’t change anything attitude is fucking painful to hear. I’m having a ton of fun playing classic and really looking forward to the later patches. It’s a different time with a different play style and some of us are capable of adapting and enjoying. For everyone else... enjoy the years of salty tears to come!
---
&gt;If you, or anyone, thinks that Vanilla/Classic is 100% perfect in every single facet, you're deluding yourself
---
It's not: however, this is what we wanted, this is what we asked for and this is what we got. If you don't want to play neither classic nor retail, fine with me and no one forces you to.
---
We can only hope.
---
Old Blanchy, PvE West coast server has great balance. I believe all PvE servers are Alliance favored but there are plenty of horde on it with a few pretty strong raiding guilds already. When the original census came out I think it showed 60% alliance to 40% horde. Either way its great and the few times I've done world pvp Its been fair and really fun. I would highly recommend if you are looking for a PvE server on westcoast time.
---
 Is this correct? It has Heartseeker at 60/40 but I assumed it was much less balanced.
---
&gt; "We know what the players have been asking for, and we understand the needs of our community. That is why we have finally decided to cancel Wow: Classic" 
---
No lie, I would be disappointed, but this would be un-utterably hilarious.
---
I can see it coming from a disgruntled CM in a few months.
---
this
---
It will be SO hard to get AQ open lol.
---
True.  Seems every guild I've ever been a part of has fewer warlocks than would be proper.
---
It sucks from a faction balance ratio... but honestly it will pass. It was probably a poor move to not just have like AV ready from Phase 1.
---
As an incentive to get high level players out of the world pvp and into a BG where they could earn the rewards they are looking for.
---
Having played some Vanilla Private servers later in their cycles world pvp was more like phase 1 of Classic. Random and enjoyable not what we are currently seeing. This was due to the fact that serious rankers were busy in battlegrounds.
---
I implore people to stay where they are at don't screw up the faction balance worse than it already is, because this too shall pass.
---
I hit you with the + lol
---
I hope this is the case. I want the pendulum to swing away from cosmetic micro transaction fluff and to more substance in games.
---
What UI is this?
---
Yeah, Wu is known throughout our guild. There is no reason to fight back because it is a war we cannot win lol
---
There's always been a distinction between PVE and PVE players, nothing to do with the server they are on. It denotes their primary interest.
---
LOTS of people on pvp servers don't really care about pvp, they are raiders. They will not spend hours in wpvp or BGs. However their friends are on the server, or they enjoy some (rare) random pvp encounters.
---
same on pve servers... lots of players there will live in BGs and avoid setting foot in any raid instance.
---
It'll gain more traction when fire mages become meta tbh.
---
They're really popular with hardcore duelists right now, but outside of that not so much
---
I'm looking to roll an alt that can be the tank for me and my buddies when tanks are hard to come by.
---
I have zero experience leveling anything other than Rogue and Hunter. I played Hunter in 2004 and I just got my rogue to 60.
---
I'm leaning towards Druid just for the versatility. But any tips would be appreciated. Also, any general tanking tips so I can at least be a semi competent tank.
---
Right, so I have tailoring and skinning right now but want to switch one or both of those out now that I’m 60. I was kinda waiting on levelling a gathering profession until I got my epic mount. 
---
I need to farm to pay for it so I think the steady income of Mara is what I’ll go with first. Switch to DME later probably. Really appreciate the responses, thanks again!
---
Yeah. The type that didn't pick alliance.
---
Came in here to post this.
---
no it is not
---
Just wanted to update on my mining and skinning journey. I'm leveling 35 now with 110g. Mind you I've skipped a number of non-crucial skills. But stone and ores have hit a steady stride on my AH, heavy stone going for ~2g/stack, sometimes 3g. I've done a handful of sm gy and lib runs, and made some decent money from vendoring or AHing BoEs, as well as disenchanting on my bank alt. I'm aiming for 150g by 40, then back up to 200-250g by 55 for devilsaur set. I think itll be entirely doable with my servers economy. Hope your journey is going well and you're making some good money!
---
&gt;They're just denials imposed on the other player, period.
---
No, you are literally contesting them. If you are both after the same thing, and it ends a fight. That contesting an objective.
---
&gt;Your second and third comments speak volumes about what you obviously don't know, which is fine, just a game after all, but explaining this to someone who's clueless is a waste of my time.
---
Oh yeah, it will happen. Not everytime, but people will hold the battleground as a "hostage" by just refusing to end and just fucking the random with their own 10 man premade.
---
Agreed but even in vanilla the PvP system sucked ass.  TBC fixed *a lot* of vanilla's issues.
---
Make no mistake, if vanilla had a 1.13 patch and people farmed DM for gold as hard as they do now - Blizzard would have needed it into oblivion.
---
That will mean lots of people, like OP here, will likely just quit. They are ending free transfers today and if you're position is right, that means there won't be any future transfers **at all,** leaving a lot of people "stuck" on servers they can't enjoy playing on.
---
don't you see the irony of your comment? dumb people like you are so hilarious
---
"clicking too fast" just admit you're dumb and fell for it bro
---
I was the first one on the biggest server, enough imo
---
Undead spriest: heh...looks like pvp happened on a pvp server... kid..
---
Dude Earthfury is the promised Land, it's like 55% Ally and 45% Horde. 
---
We have the boats, we have Blackrock Mountain, the horde are forced to gank in niche corners and if you call them out the Allies come running
---
I think the importance of claiming first has to do with the timeline from server release to accomplishing this.  Everyone is aware its been done before.
---
Dealing with the pathing of fear is mildly annoying. Enemies can bug out into terrain causing LOS issues or evade issues pretty frequently, especially in certain dungeons and areas. Sometimes the pathing makes them just keep running... all the way until they avoid and reset. Or you are trying to maintain range for a spellcast/channel and they just... keep running directly away from you. 
---
But when it comes to PvP I have no issues as it’s blatantly one of the most broken abilities in the game.
---
You don't have to, they'll either quit or transfer away before soon.
---
How about this...UNFLAG FOR PVP. They can’t kill you even on a pvp server in a major city if you’re unflagged
---
Rogues are dicks
---
This is completely untrue. There is a difference between Horder and Alliance players and I'm seek of hearing "both sides are the same".
---
Yes. We also had the advantage of knowing in advance that for pvp rewards, it doesnt matter what server you play on. Battlegrounds are available to all, and they matter. People in 2004 didn't know that Blizzard would completely drop the ball on world pvp
---
What you're talking about is ICD bud not ppm.
---
No, Horde won't be able to open the gate on Gandling anyway. The tears will be delicious. (unless BGs will really restore some resemblance of balance) Besides, I am not leaving months of progress just because Actiblizz was an ass and rushed the content. (and I am only  lvl 52 lol)
---
I've spent the last month on my lvl 27 pvp "reroll" after getting to 40 on Windseeker. I'll miss all the content anyways. Idk where you guys find the time. I'm assuming most of you are adults with full time jobs like me lol. Idc though, still having fun.
---
I missed part of the pont of your post. It's relatively easy to find a group on Earthfury, dps takes a little longer. Whitemane had faster grouping and then lots of pvp death and no flightmasters
---
If it wasn't for the fact that I had previous private server experience coming into this I would have been just as hyped for wPVP as the next guy. Can't fault people for thinking it's going to be this awesome thing when they hear these incredible war stories about the game back in '04-'06 not realizing the people sharing those stories were picking out some of their greatest experiences and memories from years of the vanilla WoW experience and condensing them down into a few paragraphs, filtered through a decade and a half of forgetfulness and nostalgia.
---
Well structured and organized PVP is not a bad thing, but as soon as battlegrounds release we're going to have endless complains from PUG players getting stomped by premades and it will showcase yet again why the PVP system is as fundamentally flawed today as it was back in 2005-2006.
---
The best part about #nochanges is we'll never have to deal with the endless carousel of buffs and nerfs to the classes as that was and still is how Blizzard 'solved' balance in WoW. The main factor that will impact power dynamics over time is character progression. The worst part about #nochanges is we have to suffer through one of the least solid competitive systems ever devised in an MMO.
---
I don't wish to change classic WoW, but I've said this for the past year: if I could replace one thing in classic it would be the honor system.
---
I'm on westfall on Horde side (30-70 favoring alliance) and it's pretty good
---
Honestly. Faction queues? So I'm being punished for picking a faction, so now every time I want to login, even on a medium pop server, I have to wait? Yea fucking right, that will never happen.
---
I want to know who's bright fuckin' idea that is, because it's by far the dumbest thing I've ever heard at least regarding this whole PvP butthurt-itude.
---
toggling off pvp doesn't stop imbeciles from camping auctioneers, flight masters, shopkeepers, etc... though he did say he was being ganked, so *that's* a him problem as far as I'm concerned
---
I was wrong, I forgot about the faction-specific items for the war effort.
---
I’m the Ret pally mascot for my raid! I love hearing the raid groan when I win loot.
---
I read r14 only allows .1% a week so 1 in 1000. So if there are 5k rankers, only 5 can go from r13-&gt;r14. But I could be wrong
---
quality content for the classicwow sub
---
Well MM hunters do get the longest range in game. Few extra yards over the rest because of a talent.
---
I played WoW on Release day. Its pretty funny seeing the SAME complaints being raised in WoW Classic.
---
Posts like this make me happy my friends talked me into horde on a different server. My level 5 ally char on Skeram is safe at least.
---
I dont claim to have proof but I think it's pretty obvious that gankers and griefers are more attracted to horde as a faction. Makes sense as well
---
It's true back in the day when I explained WoW to people I always said smth. to the likes of "it's a chat program with good graphics".
---
Not wrong
---
As far as I’m aware, 5k is average active population for a server. Maybe even less than that. Which means, if your numbers are right, one per week tops.
---
Have fun with your queues even in cross realm
---
I stomp fury warriors with daggers every time they don't even come close. It's almost as funny as a ret paladin.
---
The interrupt protection helps if you pull one or two mobs on you, but if the whole group is beating on the Lock, you can kiss that AoE cast goodbye.  
---
Considering your mana pool will only let you cast 3-4 Rain of Fire between drinks *at most*, I think you'll have a tough time with this unless you can find a good way to keep the mobs off the Lock.
---
Rogues are already boned cause of spy addon tbh. Even with the nerf its tough for them.
---
There's no way my server Deviate Delight has 3k players online at once. It's still aids to run into BRD. It literally only takes 1 level 60 to camp your ass from flight path to BRD. 20 people killing you or 1 person killing you makes not much difference.
---
Me too
---
What's your characters name?
---
I honestly don’t bother with openers in regular 5 man trash pulls. I see a lot of combat rogues behind the melee pack stealthing and wasting multiple seconds of dps for minimal reward. I guess I’m kind of low effort.
---
Sure, enjoy #30 on the dps charts LEL
---
... crossing you off of people I would run a dungeon with
---
Please, go on. In what way does it make sense?
---
Everybody does
---
I just hit that same wall.  Questing in Badlands was really tough as an Alliance.  I was much more successful in STV.
---
And 40 man zerg groups can be formed by any faction at any time, even if you're outnumbered 10/1. Wpvp isn't designed to be fair, but that's what was asked for so that's what we got.
---
The people who don't like it need to find a solution for themselves or wait another week and see how BGs change the state of the game. But asking for Blizzard to start restricting player's access to the game is ridiculous.
---
collecting as much mats as you can before you transfer. Maybe buy some items that have a low cost on your server and a higher cost on w/e server you're moving to
---
I think they mean dishonor in the traditional sense. But idk a lot of people think gray = dk.
---
PVE servers have a lot of people flagged up in areas such as SS vs TM and many players flag up when contesting something that is about to spawn. There are loads of people WPVPing on PVE servers. The only thing PVE servers don't have an abundance of is ganking.
---
Kargath. You can stealth around kargath looking for squishy/afk players and nuke them. You’ll die a lot, but a near-guaranteed kill every time you rez. You can scout out potential targets and wait for cooldowns while in spirit form. When you’re ready, rez, stealth, nuke. Rinse repeat. The GY is close by, so it’s not like you have a 5-10min run when you die. It’s pretty good honor overall though.
---
Stormscale, horde.
---
Real premades, as in tryhards ranking and who know what they're doing with strong composition, will be tilting games in 7 minutes and requeueing, they're in the business of controlling standings and farming honor, not farming pugs in graveyards that shit is boring and serves no point, really.
---
Yep, hit level 48 and logged off. Was a fun journey and had some laughs. No honor from me no lifers.
---
They'll happen if Blizzard decides they'd rather those players playing on PvE servers (and paying a sub) then now playing at all (and not paying a sub). But it's impossible to know if they'll make that decision and only they have sub metrics to see if people are actually leaving the  game over PvP situation.
---
It could be possible my ret paladin is a big noob. 
---
There should be a way to find out the average dps of a ret paladin using warcraftlogs, but I just cant figure it out honestly.
---
Me and my troll ponytail feel your pain.
---
If you feel like grinding the unstoppable force from AV that’s a really good one for not doing any raids
---
Fully agree.  Played vanilla on Mal'Galnis - getting to raids wasn't as big an issue but world content was still an uphill battle.
---
It really makes people feel better to have something tangible to criticize.  I have just about everything bound but let's be honest, it's 90% laziness: You literally have 1.5 seconds to reach your next ability.  It's not hard to click fast or accurately enough to do what needs to be done, especially if you're used to it.
---
Not all of them, just most of them. Your hits are replaced with crits but not all swings are landed. Also in PvE you still get glancing blows with reck up.
---
I absolutely would if I was having a miserable experience. Sunken cost fallacy and all that.
---
Roll on a PvE server, ask in /1 if anyone has gold/bags to spare for a PvP server refugee, dick around for a while and see if you're having fun. Not like it's going to make your PvP server toons disappear.
---
How monsters and misfits would attracts griefers and broken people more than the archetypical heroes? Do I really need to explain that ?
---
These numbers are level 5+, not 60.
---
Yes I’d like to know too so I can avoid it
---
and this further makes the minority faction not want to play (no safe space)
---
It probably depends where in the leveling pack you were. I was a decent chunk ahead of the pack. Wherever I was leveling, it was dead. If I went back to the zone a few days later for some reason, it was hopping with action.
---
Lol I could beat rogues on the meters w my bare hands.
---
Daggers suck in cleave for warrior but single target alliance side they top meters. Especially in long execute phases like vael.
---
I dont know what nerfs you mean exactly, but we have the new updated gear and talents from the start which is the massive nerf I am talking about.
---
Not even close. It's showing my server as 96% alliance in the last 7 days, and it's definitely missing several of the races and classes I saw just yesterday.
---
Try to use the filters.
---
Specifically last seen, and characters over lets say 20, should give a more accurate result, as it takes activity and investment into account.
---
I was basing that on [this](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4699_Kromcrush) that reports 40,716 on Kromcrush. Am I misinterpreting that?
---
So since everything is so imbalanced, what will the horde do while they wait in their hour long queues for BGs? Probably go WPVP. This is just going to get worse.
---
Ill add to this and say I used whirlwind axe until level 50 when I started to feel it getting really weak. Got Gatorbite from Mara to replace it with.
---
He was probably just trying to act like he meant to do it when he was super embarrassed or something.  I ended up running arena 40+ times to get the Sash for my Warlock which doesn't sound bad except that somewhere around my 20th run a Paladin needed on it and beat me on a roll.  His excuse was that he had accidentally read the +hit stat on it as +crit - so basically a BiS belt for Warlock was won by a healing Paladin - who was level 53 to my 59 or something.  Yay.
---
It honestly doesn't happen often enough for me to worry about it and is somewhat anecdotal but I can see how it would annoy people.
---
so 3 characters all max level on the same server you hate, or?
---
It depends!
---
Do you have Aged core leather gloves?  If not, you probably want distracting dagger.
---
If you do have AGLC then it's probably a toss up between Bonescraper/Gutgore.  In terms of DPS, gutgore ends up being like 38 vs about 30 for the Bonescraper in the OH.  The 30 AP also affects you MH so the 8 DPS difference ends up being like 4ish DPS in pure AA damage.  It's even lower once you take into account the BS damage added to your MH.  The Gutgore proc i something like 1.3 PPM so in the OH is only worth aobut 1.6dps.  Not including the bonus backstab damage from the bonescraper AP it's like maybe 5 DPS.  Then you have to take into account he poison procs.  Basically if you expect at least one bonus poison proc per minute, the Bonescraper OH is about equal to a gutgore OH.
---
It's no better being the majority with that big of a faction imbalance. Just a different kind of shit
---
I’m an undead mage. I just know first hand from dying multiple times on my way there lol
---
This is what it feels like for me too, bouncing around zones picking up quests where I can. On a good night I can grind out 1/2 a level and then log again. At this rate I'll be lucky to hit 60 before Christmas (currently 56).
---
I play Horde on Kromcrush and I would say for the most part the PvP is fair. Certain zones have more alliance than horde from time to time. And almost all endgame zones are relatively contested. Things I have noticed is horde definitely dominates BRM the majority of the time, Alliance safe-spot a lot more than horde, and Alliance seem to care about WPvP a lot more. They actually have other alliance passing by stop and help if they see someone fighting horde, whereas horde will just mind their own business most of the time and not bother to stop and help. 
---
I think it’s probably one of the more even NA PvP servers.
---
I understand where you're coming from, but no matter how good you are, you can't avoid getting ganked and body camped by groups if they catch you slippin. Complaining on reddit about it, I agree. That's pointless and will only serve to piss off the poster more when nobody sympathizes with them.
---
Hmm, guess I messed up somehow when I was farming them last week.
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
from a character name in game? all this would result in is a lot of spam in their mail box which would at worst for them mean theyd have to make a new alt to scam people. this seems a fair punishment for mail scams to me /shrug
---
That's what happens. That's what people should be expecting. They shouldn't be expecting not being able to run any dungeons because there's 20 Horde killing them every step of the way.
---
The big problem is the way it sorts you into your roles. I dont know how its sorted for paladins, but like on Ragnaros it has me classified as a dps warrior, because I was in berserker stance. Despite it showing that, I'm currently deep prot spec. 
---
Add on to that the fact that the way guilds are sorted doesnt show those parses who arent listed as a guild (i.e., it doesnt show my guild on our server rankings, despite us logging our raids for multiple weeks) and the results very quickly become skewed. 
---
I did look at DPS pallies for my server, and I was seeing 170-190 to be a relatively geared paladin, so if I had to guess I'd say that's the norm.
---
&gt;Regaurading
---
my sides
---
Hey thanks for the update, those are pretty awesome results. I'm just in my early 20s now but I'm finally getting mining stacks and leather that are bringing me in a good amount of gold, so looks like it will pay off in the end.
---
You are right, most of the time they will just roflstomp all BGs.
---
And corpsecamping is not always that common in WSG (it happens occasionally when they are having fun) but it does happen a bunch in AB when they just take all the bases and corpsecamp until the BG ends.
---
LMFAO so it was the same shitters camping me for 10 deaths straight coming to the forms and complaining about how they’re missing honor when in reality it was their mental handicap that has been holding them back
---
Lol this is a joke right?
---
This soooo much this
---
Should I just stop farming honor? Because 1 person wont make a difference and I can't control the other 2,000 who would benefit if I did.
---
But you're still wrong. They can de-flag in their cities and be perfectly safe. Funny enough, plenty seem willing to flag while  in the safe confines of their capital where they have huge numbers. Ironic if you think about it.
---
:o
---
I was under the impression it only helped at the extreme low and high ends of herbalism. Had no idea it was determined by your base proficiency. Fuck, why did i go troll shaman.....
---
&gt;In vanilla I played on Ursin (low pop) and was in one of the 3 active alliance raiding guilds.
---
I played there and lead one of those guilds! I was an explosive asshole back then, so you might have known and disliked me!
---
You think good people in real life are more likely to play heroes? While bad people will choose horde? Do you have any basis for saying this?

Yeah pretty much.  #NoChanges was a total joke that probably hurt Classic a lot more than people realize.  Sure, on paper it's a great idea to keep the game how it was years ago.  But what they forgot or conveniently failed to mention is that the attitude and style of player have changed.  That's why content feels so easy compared to old videos you dig up (seriously, something like UBRS was considered hard when it's a complete joke now)
---
That's why you have people doing weird stuff in dungeons or only doing cleave groups to maximize XP, or all the other things that aren't really Vanilla but stuff learned from years on private servers.  That's why you have the shitshow that is world PVP (disclaimer:  I am on a PVE server as Alliance so this doesn't affect me).
---
 #NoChanges only can affect the game, not the people, and thanks to the people #NoChanges shows all of its problems.  You were never going to get the community of 2004 back because the community has *changed*.  So instead you have a stagnant game with people who have a totally different mindset from what it was.
---
I quit at 58 T-T
---
That site isn't reliable at all. The 7-day activity shows my horde-heavy server as 96% alliance, all undead of one of three classes, and I saw a number of horde just yesterday of classes and races not on the list.
---
Two different things man
---
&gt; the xbow is slower so it creates higher crit damage
---
Nope, definitely dont agree with that incorrect statement but it's good to know where reading comprehension levels are at for one half of this conversation.
---
Also honorless
---
Thats neither the problem at hand nor does it have anything to do what is being discussed...
---
They will be in a cross realm battlegroup with other servers so won't have an issue finding games
---
On a scale 1-5 how inbred are you?
---
Man I hope thats an exaggeration because juggling a bunch of healer's egos sounds awful. XD
---
Got me good
---
My understanding is the following:
---
**Solo play** \- Cheap Shot as you are preventing dmg to your flimsy self and it gets your sliice and dice running sooner (CS -&gt; SnD -&gt; SS).
---
**5-10 Man** \- Garrote, as you apply a DoT, let the tank gain rage from incoming damage, and maybe you can silence a caster for a bit as a bonus (since they often switch to pummeling the healer)
---
**Raids** \- Don't stealth, just run up when told and wail away. BECAUSE - bosses are immune to Cheap Shot and the Garrote DoT slot is better used by a Warlock (limited number of DoT slots on a boss).
---
Nah. At least you can do group pve with the majority. As the minority you can't really find groups for anything.
---
Hmm, probably just bad luck today. Try forming the group yourself if you haven't already. Sometimes I spend a couple hours looking for groups even for the high level dungeons and eventually give up and start the group myself and typically have a group ready in 15 mins. There's a lot that just don't take the initiative.
---
Hes just a little sad he hasnt been first anything.
---
I think a lot of the thing that really gets me, is that people don't understand that you can like both classic and retail, they are two different games. Sometimes its nice to come home after work and hop on retail and play for an hour or two and do a wing of LFR and get a piece of new gear or do a quick BG or whatever it may be that you want to do. I timed it once or twice on my hunter in classic, to get from stormwind to darn for my 150-225 LW training, it was around a full hour round trip, by the time I took the tram to IF, flew to menethil, took the boat to auberdine, took the other boat to darn, then actually walked all the way through darn from the boat dock, to the LW trainer, to getting my new recipes, to hearthing back to SW, and I just don't often have that kind of  time to spend on a game, when I can only play for say 2-4 hours a day after work. But classic is fun and different in its own right. Theres a middle ground between looking for a low level dungeon group on a medium pop server for 45 minutes to do the single run for the quests, and then having that dungeon taking an hour to complete, and playing retail and getting 3-4 levels in 15 minutes in the exact same dungeon.
---
For the first week or two it was pretty Horde dominated but now it seems like its starting even out. It becoming more enjoyable due to moments when 30 Alliance meet 30 Horde at LHC
---
Lol you kidding me? Of course it’s 100x better being a horde in that server. The only thing that’s bad is you won’t see any wPvP or AQ gates will take a loooong time.
---
Benefits? They basically level like it’s a PvE server and don’t end up quitting before 60 due to corpse runs
---
I'm not here to argue one way or the other. I damn well know horde as dicks by the pics here and I know alliance or dicks by what happens to me when I'm online. Either way people are dicks and I'll continue enjoying classic WoW.
---
Those armor potions make up for you not having a shield. The difference is measurable.
---
Ya I dont blame ya, thats why I didnt be mean about it.
---
I don't know how you guys can stand playing without Tactical Mastery
---
1 shotting gnomes just feels so good, I can't help it.
---
...like which ones?
---
Multiple people mentioned PvP and brm, both of which are pretty awful right now because of the increased cap.  There are waaaaaay more people out pvping which is making just trying to get to a brm instance a 30 minute run on most servers if you are the underdog.
---
So yes, it is the problem at hand and does have things in line with what's being discussed, go be an ass elsewhere.
---
In b4 "I'm casual and have 3 60s".
---
Me too man, just to get to the BRD it takes like 15 minutes from trying to get into the instance. Havnt played since the first week of honor system, my lvl 57 have been sitting for way too long. To be honest I probably won’t play again because I will not have any good gear for the future phases. Questing is so much fun wish I could get back into it.
---
 "It is actually impossible to achieve rank 14 in less than 12 weeks, and that assumes that you’re the top player on your faction for every one of those 12 weeks."  - Blizzard
---
"Take everything in moderation, including world of Warcraft" - Also Blizzard
---
Came here to say this. Pre pop an arcane prot pot and use a resto pot on pull and you should be fine. If all the melee in your guild do this the boss does in like 20 seconds and nobody dies
---
Not sure on the accuracy of that census for Thunderfury, at the very least there's not enough Horde players uploading in the last two weeks. I imagine PvE servers are more accurate, with census users collecting data from both factions and all.
---
Then again I heard blizzard broke census add-ons so how accurate can any of this be if this is still true?
---
Envy doesn’t even have the fastest MC clear on the server.
---
I'd like to come back to Classic and start fresh on a somewhat balanced, low-mid US East PvP realm, but I'm worried ganking at this point is going to be an all time high. Is it worth it right now for someone with limited time? STV aside, how bad is it really? I really don't want to roll PvE just to feel like I'm making progress.
---
I mean it's all up to chance. There's a chance you could win the next 10 rolls and there's a chance you could never win one. Pretty simple.
---
Encourage your guild to move to loot council.
---
Blame NoChanges because a change (increasing player limit per server) made the game an unplayable mess. r/ClassicWoW retardation at its finest.
---
It has Kirtonos as Alliance dominated. Alliance is a ghost town 6 days of the week.
---
Blizzard doesn't care lol
---
Will grab one for tonight's SFK run. Thanks !
---
There is not a single proper alliance guild left on the server. The most stubborn people from Everyday Heroes formed Leftovers but they will die within a month. This is absolutely insane.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1001#metric=execution
---
You don't have to like them to recognize that they're competent raiders.
---
That's really weird. I was also parsed as a tank on Gehennas, as well as Baron Geddon, Shazzrah, and Majordomo. I don't know what dictates that. Your theory would make sense, IF it listed me as a tank on Garr, considering I tanked 3 of the ads. At the same time, the theory that stance matters would make sense, but it listed you as a DPS for Lucifron.
---
Either way, this is why I don't always trust role selection on warcraft logs.
---
Thank's for taking the time to repost this, it's so much more clear then the last post.
---
No one said he wasn't. They were just wondering why he felt the need to dance on the corpse of someone 12 levels lower than him.
---
i try turnin xp bar or rep on /off, still showing. When i click on bartender (making everything movable) the bar is not clickable.  
---
Still can't moove it
---
BAITED SON
---
When the game wasn't solved and the realm populations were fractions of what they are now.
---
Why are you wasting time in this game in first place then?
---
"Yeah, just fight the Horde off who have 30 players per 1 alliance player, ezpz."
---
Blizzard should have taken some of the pserver guys onto the team, so things like extreme faction imba wouldnt be a surprise
---
Only higher level fire related mobs drop ele fire. That includes flame imps, fire and lava elementals, etc.
---
Blizzard isn't letting us server transfer...
---
Now this is what I call edgy.
---
I think if its balanced close to 50-50, alliance can at least hold on to one camp, and probably contest another (there are 3 camps in silithus), and thus both factions can at least farm it. If its a 30% server, horde will get all the camps and alliance will be busy scratching their ass and fall way behind.
---
Its an absolute fucking shitshow regardless, but if both factions are competitive its actually fun, if they aren't its not fun. Even if you manage to summon one of the 40 man bosses as alliance, your raid just gets wiped so signficant manpower and decent balance is required to actualy to do that content on a PvP server.
---
these posts are great to see over and over
---
What guilds are the ones that camp? I personally only wpvp when it's in my way (like gnomes spamming the SG choke at BRM and pallies camping  stray), so I can't say Ive ever even been to rrm on my main. I think the griefing is awful personally.
---
Although I agree, the larger benefit is reminding the whole community what the spirit of WoW is supposed to be and hopefully reminding / convincing more people to take a similar approach.
---
Well you will eventually right?
---
But as for the other question I dont think its too late. You can use a guild that uses a good system that prevents hoarding a bit(like fixed dkp prices that cost % of dkp or epgp) and even in any other system you will be able to get the lower desired pieces right away (like the t1 stuff) and then get the weapons later.
---
Ayyy that guy killed me 3 times the day before yesterday in like that same spot. I’m 50.
---
And most people choose their faction like that. But if you cant see some logic in what I wrote then I dont k ow what to tell you :-)
---
Not really looks bloomy and blurred
---
You can slow them down to the point of giving up - which is area denial.
---
Can confirm Grobbulus is a kill box during peak hours.
---
Assuming its the same 40 people competing every week, the obvious answer is yes, you will.
---
Remember that every time someone wins an item they forever will not roll against you for it again. 
---
Making another assumption, that everyone in guild knows what items they should be prioritizing.
---
Gandling EU here. Think it’s pretty balanced. There’s loads of Horde but they move in big groups, easy to avoid.
---
....what
---
Did you watch the video? It was recorded on Classic, and all the Reck Paladins I know use /sit /stand macros to this day. With all the other videos that can be found uploaded since release of /sit /stand Reck procs, I'd have to be shown a video that shows it *not* working to believe otherwise.
---
A full length Fear will absolutely run a mob out of draw distance if it RNGs in a fairly straight line. Its not every time, but it's frequent enough that I often have to run after mobs, not because because I'm actually trying to hit them, but just to keep them from resetting.
---
Interestingly it doesn't happen with players, e.g. if you Fear them out of render range, they will remain feared. This raises metaphysical questions about whether Fear only exists if there is someone there to experience it, causing great unrest among Warlockian philosophers.
---
AB wont be out. Just WSG/AV
---
Should I keep trying to sell it or just use it? I'm OT for my guild, so it wouldn't benefit me a ton, but I can't get rid of it no matter how much I try. 
---
I crafted it the week before phase 2 was coming out, thinking I could make a 50-60g profit on it (and the price of the schematic tripled next week, so I was still selling cheaper than someone could make themselves), but here we are several weeks later and I still haven't sold it. The best offer I've got was for only 300g, which is 150g cheaper than just mats, not to mention the 45g I paid for the recipe.
---
I have no idea, but it seems to be the most popular census site, and thus should have the most data.
---
I think it has decent estimates at least, at least from the perspective the servers that I have played on.
---
Yeah. People who play GTA are also known to be more violent in real life. Maybe you are right.
---
All the Blizzdrones in here seem to clamber over each to upvote this moron (OP) though. A change from Vanilla that Blizzard is responsible for is somehow the fault of the movement that doesn’t want changes rather than.... Blizzard? The amount of mental gymnastics is impressive.
---
Same, on Stalagg as Alliance I spent 1-60 hiding inside instances and running back to my corpse whenever I zoned out to reset.
---
The way they said "racking" in dishonor kind of made it seem like a quantifiable amount.
---
how did the server not crash with 500 people swarming a single spot lol
---
What's the deal with getting exalted to AV and the mount there? I'm 57 and still a ways away from being able to afford my epic mount.
---
we got people seeking medical advice in our lfg chat lol. 
---
everyone loves to chew the fat there.
---
Someone that works for me told me he has 7. He's a ups preloader, a bouncer at night clubs before he comes in at 2 am, and recently adopted a 16 year old kid at the age of 22. I don't believe him lol
---
*this*
---
Yes. WoW provides anonymity + social interaction which makes people act with zero inhibitions. I mean if both factions were just black boxes with zero or identical psychological appeal the split would be 50/50 wouldn't it. The fact that large majority of people on PvP servers chose Horde says something about the psychology of Horde players.
---
The racial is worth way more than 3% hit.  It also reduces the glancing penalty from 40% to 15%.
---
&gt; Sure and I'm Horde. Zug zug and all that other business.
---
You're the person who wants try to make this about me not wanting to give up "an advantage".  I am alliance on a pve server.  You can try to be flippant all you want but it doesn't change the point that your plan is awful.
---
&gt;there will be a lot of shards that are Horde only with zero Alliance because of all the excess Horde scum. 
---
The point isn't to make it better for Horde, the point is to alleviate the problem for the alliance without preventing Horde from playing the game.  Not being able to form a roaming gank raid isn't the same as not being able to log in at all.
---
&gt;Best solution would have been to not allow players to choose servers themselves,
---
That isn't a solution because we cannot change the past.
---
&gt;After that, connect all servers and, since server population fluctuates relative to time of day, and cross server shard to ensure as equal of a number of people on a single version of the world as possible.
---
So after all that you come up with Sharding?
---
You think everyone will be happy simply being automatically assigned Alliance/Horde without being able to choose or are you imagining a world where somehow things go differently because you really want it to happen?
---
Sorry, but even back in the day, barely anyone actually did world pvp. Even people on pvp servers. PVP mostly amounted to randomly ganking a low level player  as you ran to a dungeon. That was the extent of 95% of players pvp interaction on a pvp server. Back and forth battles between equal teams was never a thing.
---
Unless you're very close to the boss it's often a DPS loss to even do an opener versus just running up and SSing
---
It is, but it's also boring.
---
I'm on Earthfury and I don't think it's that bad, but apparently we are Alliance-favored and I'm alliance, so that might explain it. Sure, it'll happen, but there was only one time where I was like "fuck this, I'm not playing right now"
---
I never did that sh\*t. For real.
---
Yeah but if you were ahead of the pack, you werent going to magically be seeing people everywhere. Hell how many of the people rushing ahead even *wanted* to see anyone and slow down what was clearly a sprint to 60?
---
This is what the server looks like right now. All guilds have left.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/OianWJz](https://imgur.com/a/OianWJz)
---
I've been on every major pserver launch since o.g Nost and never has the draw distance been tampered with.
---
This is entirely unique to classic.
---
Until 48 your relatively safe. Just the usual gank squads or 1v1 at lower lvls. Bgs come on the 10th so wpvp will be less also.
---
I'm 55 and after hitting 50 it got much much worse since I now give honor to level 60s. It's  magnitudes worse than hillsbrad or stv was. I must have been killed 15-20 times yesterday.
---
It's funny how some people think it's an alliance only problem, but I'm horde on a balanced server and it's still almost unplayable at peak times.
---
I have more /played on my decked out main then other people with multiple 60s. For me the game is logging in and fooling around. I do dungeons I don't need to and Help players because I like the game. I stand in capital for an hour and just watch chat. I love it. I don't need to do something every second and that's exactly the reason why I love wow over Other games where high tension all the time
---
Wait ... the imbalance is this bad *and they're letting alliance transfer OFF!?* 
---
Way too fix the problem, blizz
---
Its not this bad on my server but we have groups of about 10 ganking inside IF and larger groups attacking the front gates. If you're lucky other alliance will help otherwise they all just sit there and watch you die. I fear  we are headed down this road.
---
I dont Know if that is true. But I'm certain there are psychological conclusions that can be drawn from HOW someone play gta
---

While I don’t Like the no changes mentality. I think that the changes are the problem.   Here are 3 examples.  
---
1)  layering.  While layering is gone, the impact is still great.   The most skilled players and the players who do nothing but play WoW were able to get a huge advantage that they other wise would not have had.  These players were able to take advantage of this change and create huge wealth and surplus of the rarest resources.    This has had and will have a lasting impact.  
---
2) players know what next, which is a change from vanilla.   These top tier, highly skilled, and un-encumbered (as in their spend 12+ hours a day playing) knew what would be valued based on what was coming next.  They knew when honor would hit and made sure to be ready.  They know exactly what to do and when to do it.  The only mystery is when not what.  This is a substantial change.  
---
3) a decade of private servers.  Everything is hyper optimized.   When I played in original release, I never considered wearing mail as a warrior.  Now, I know that sometimes it’s the best option.  The entire community as quick and easy access to the ins and outs of the game.  The player base from the new kid who wasn’t born in 04 to the 50 year old who played beta, all have access to a huge trove of information that wasn’t available.  
---
I don’t play anyone.  I will continue to corpse run and hope that BGs help.  But the idea of no changes is silly.  There have been huge changes, and they are having a huge impact on the game.
---
I am really torn right now on what to do in Classic. It has been extremely enjoyable and also frustrating at time, on a level which I can't even describe in words.  
---
I want to leave my PVP server which is about 70:30 (Horde:Ally) due to the sheer domination of quite literally every important zone to farm or run dungeons. The amount of time I have spent as a ghost running to my body is absurd.  
---
I have played on PVP servers my entire time on WoW, since I started in the later part of Burning Crusade. I have played during every subsequent expansion and I have never been repeatedly zerged on this level.  
---
My guildies tell me that things will get better when BGs drop and to hold on and stay.. and I truly love my guild. Best one I have been in for a long time- but I am hating the wasted time. If BGs dont change anything and I am locked to the server, welp, probably going to just un-sub.  
---
The world in Classic is just too small right now, there are few options for things to do so the opposing faction can control all of them all the time.
---
Was going to also suggest this!
---
Haha ye dunno mate, I actually don’t know how many horde there were but all I know is that they owned us very hard with zappers and AoE. :P
---
Honestly same thing happened to me today i dinged 48 on my hunter and had a war instantly charge me.
---
This just isn’t true, I got a couple of elemental fire from these guys while leveling, sold them to snag a couple of gear upgrades when rerolling to new server.
---
Rate is trash but they do drop.
---
Wanting good pvp racials maybe? Which might have been meaningful if PvP was synonymous with griefing.

---
Sure, but the "reckoning build" is where you spec into it to build stacks from sitting down. The infinite stacks got hotfixed immediately and isn't something people had time to make a build around.
---
Because if you can farm 10-20k honor per hour doing wsg, why would you be world pvping, it's just gonna get you lower honor.
---
You're right, you're owed their time.
---
Yeah, Vanilla WoW is basically a solved game. Everyone is min/maxing out of the gates and wants the best of the best and won't even bother with the other content.
---
WPVP without the honor system was good. WPVP with the honor system incentivizes being a complete twat. No honor system = players aren't a resource to be farmed, wpvp is organic and happens over resource scarcity or just for fun. WPVP with honor system = players are a resource to be farmed just like any other farm. It's broken.
---
and also because fair encounter basically never happen in WPvP; if it's not a 5v1,someone will be at half-health from fighting a mob or those damned goblin guard will get in the way.
---
atleast in WSG/AB the numbers are even, the level are even ( at lvl 60), and there's no PvE in the way.
---
I think this comparison has a fundamental flaw.
---
Alliance is just UNABLE to farm things out in the world.
---
Even in a place where it's like 3:1, the majority faction will simply shut down open world farming for the other faction.
---
This will severely skew the ability for the other faction to farm things and put them up for sale. Even if they are "only" 3:1 ratio for example. So the disparity is going to look extremely uneven.
---
Faction imbalance, horde "favoured" is why. Combine that with the fact that blizzard increased the server size, meaning when one group stops pvping another group takes their place. Too many people crowded into small zones.
---
And of course I don't care about anecdotes. But we can trade one if you'd like. I got ganked 6 times by a lvl 60 alliance in STV who had an alt account horde character in the same zone. He would then whisper everyone he killed with his horde character and mock at them.
---
You could search their names on Warcraft Logs and see if it comes up and what server they're on. But I don't think it will update until they raid on the new server once
---
You must have a lot of friends
---

---
I wanted classic but I didn’t want this many players on a server. I naively thought we would have regular classic server sizes because well that’s what classic was designed around holding.
---
feed your pet, you monster.
---
K but I’m not a rogue lol
---
Except... If blizzard had the tech, they would have bloated their past servers. Stop saying "intended", when all they did was use what they had at the time. Ffs
---
I was Alliance on that server and I'm out of there! I couldnt quest or walk around and me and my friends got ganked by Horde. Sucked out all the fun of the game
---
If you stun things in group PVE encounters, you make the tank sad.
---
Tanks generate threat by being hit (usually to generate their resource rage, or paladins to have them block a lot).
---
How exactly did I deny that they are top 5 ony kill on that one website? Dont remember disputing that at all but you do you my dude
---
Lol it hasn't been tooo bad.  Ive almost got my second 60 which is a druid who can find dungeon groups a lot easier :P so that's a blessing. People ganking my hunter and killing pet was a whole other story trying to do my prebis quests out in EPL but meh I've got a high tolerance for it so I don't mind making a sammich or going on Netflix/YouTube to find amusing videos like the one made here :P hopefully battlegrounds are out by the time my shaman is around 40... Really counting on them alleviating some of the griefing people are resorting to :S
---
Been playing on Double D since the day after launch and I love it!  It is definitely a dad server and a higher proportion of casuals, which is perfect for me, since I am both a dad and a casual
---
Lol yea I think it's pretty funny
---
im casual only play 2 hrs a week but i have 2 hands of rag, once with crusader and one with beastslaying for the memes, anyone can do it!
---
He has a bunch of games you can play. Blackjack being the most common, same rules as 21, instead you bust if you go over 100 and just /roll to hit. Once you stay he hits till he beats you or busts. He even gives bigger payouts if you get 98-100. The current top payouts are 600g. He has been doing this for over a week now, and as far as I can tell people love it.
---
So they jacked spell power and what else?
---
yep, cancelling tonight..
---
It really doesn't matter what game it is, if a person in a multiplayer game can't be bothered to watch a couple videos and read a basic guide or two, I just am not interested in playing with them.
---
Look, if you cant see how it makes sense that STATISTICALLY there would be a few more assholes on the horde side than ally. Now combine THAT with faction imbalance and we have the current situation
---
why do you think we care about your ignore list?
---
Assholes are always going to exist, regardless of your cry posts about them.
---
You mean the safe zones where the enemy faction isn't even flagged?
---
?
---
Nostalrius had shit draw distance at peak hours. There were a shit tonne of complaints about it when it was still active.
---
2 things:
---
1. Shit CAN come up so don’t be that guy.
---
2. Dungeon times can vary greatly depending on the people in the group, so don’t pretend like you know exactly how long every group will take in any dungeon you do.
---
“Oh well these are just BS excuses that people make up to drop the group if they don’t want to be in it anymore!” Yeah, no shit. It happens. But not ALL of it is BS and most importantly, people are not required to stay in a group with you if they don’t want to! If your decision is to not play with these people, cool, more power to you. Don’t bother whining about it on reddit, though. It’s not going to change anything. Get over it.
---
I remember the draw distance for nostalrius being like 40 yards. Super small. Sometimes it felt smaller . Especially to what is in classic WoW
---
As an aggregate it's not *that* unbalanced, probably no more than 60:40 which is not going to be terrible for queues.  Though that's no indication of how people will queue.  If pvp servers were in the same battlegroup as pve servers, that would go a long way towards solving any issue with balance.
---
Also you have to queue in town so there's that too.
---
There's no conceivable way it "gets worse".  Maybe it doesn't improve as much as we hope, but it certainly can't get worse.
---
Now that's real PvP dominance, hats off to the horde brothers over there
---
Go to sixtyupgrades.com and put in ur current level and choose the feral druid tank build thats on there under eq points preset. 
---
If u dont plan on pvp make sure to turn ur pvp level down on it also, otherwise that gear will pop up as u get to the higher levels. 
---
i think this site does a good job at giving u close to BiS while u level.
---
You may not have a life. You may not have enough friends for one to randomly suprise you with a visit.

Get a good guild. I never PUG.

It was Blizzards choice to go along with the ridiculous notion of no changes not the zealots pushing for it. 
---
Blizzard liked the idea of no changes people were spouting because it meant minimal effort on their part to toss bloody Classic at the market with low expectations as shown by the number of servers opened on launch.
---
That's what PvE servers have always been about. Most of us like PvP, we just like PvP *on our terms*. It's all about having control over your own gametime, especially now that many of us have a limited amount of it. No one wants to spend 2 hours getting camped by a 14yo with nothing better to do
---
I enjoy decent pvp. Not this trash
---
Bear tanks just don't have the gear compared to warriors. The threat from dps at these stages also forces fury prot tanks
---
You do realise why the serves aren’t balanced? Yes it’s near impossible to fix now but it was easily preventable before release if they had enough servers and made the servers smaller. Do you think it’s difficult for a billion dollar company to get a even split on their servers? Use your brain please
---
Paid server transfers were available in Vanilla, enabling them is no changes.
---
It didn't die, but honor farmers went to bgs. WPVP still existed while leveling in places like Hilsbrad and STV which were always notorious. Organic WPVP, the kind everyone remembers fondly was always there. What we have currently is something different.
---
Make it look terrible?
---
I have itemrack and I don’t have that trinket option.
---
I think R10 is pretty achievable in wPVP, not sure about over 10. I don't think a lot of people are concerned about being R14 week in and week out, just stockpile gold to buy their items the week they get it and then relax. So, those that are a little more casual in either their play time or "honor farming" methods will most likely get their shot at the higher ranks later on. Just my 2 cents, I could be wrong! Happy grinding! :)
---
I miss tac mastery so much, but being able to do functionally decent dps, whilst still being able to tank with 100% effectiveness makes up for it.
---
the dude suffer from a common syndrome on the internet.
---
he cannot read full sentences, understand context and make argument... instead he'll pick 3 word semi-randomly, imagine what's your position based on those 3 word, and answer to said position.
---
don't bother arguing... unless you do enjoy wasting time on the internet.
---
:D never said that, but I accept that it's a standard sentence that you learned to justify the victim complex
---
WPVP is for fun and to compete for resources, BGs are for farming honor. They coexist.
---
It is a zero sum game. Only one person can win. total number of kills doesn't matter over a base threshold. Your % rank on your faction is all that really matters. So helping a fellow horde gank someone is worse than letting them die then killing the weakened alliance player on your own.
---

this was the duel exploit. Diffrent than here.
---
I have 100s of hours played, I really am not wanting to farm up my epic mount gold again, flask recipes, raid gear, etc.  It's really just not okay that the solution should be "just reroll".. Blizzard fucked up by making mega servers, not me
---
Weird how some ppl care so much about being the best at wow--it doesn't fucking matter at all. I play the game the way I want to, because I care about having fun
---
Whitemane is dope man. Tons of Ally pvp groups all around. The gorge and BRM are constant battles between small groups.
---
Blind?
---
And at transferring people's brains
---
Go tell Flamelash we need more servers.
---
Earthshaker is pretty decent
---
Certainly can't speak for everyone but I made my first character Horde in honor of my first WoW character who was Horde too. That was the only reason.
---
Seeing another player running in after you fail the 2nd one makes diamonds outta coal for sure
---
I’m not that kind of mascot haha
---
Gordo was the Dwarf right? Hahaha man ...
---
Aoe damage from healers will destroy non warriors and healers will oom pretty bad unless geared to the teeth
---
This is usually a polite way of saying "this group is a steaming pile of shit and I'm sick of wiping"
---
chances are they also don't want to group with you again.
---
alright thats it, im setting my game to german  
---
im done casting frostbolt, i wanna cast frostblitz now
---
The Strat Live ammo "miniature cannon balls" paired with a gun provides a nice little dps increase.
---
You wouldn't be able to overcome the weekly loss applied to your current standings.
---
A lot of people just started late. My alt is at level 59 and I've grouped with a bunch of people so far that don't have a main at 60.
---
in 2019, anyone with a mouth or a keyboard is a psychologist and more than willing to give hot takes
---
Okay.
---
This is false. The max draw length in vanilla was much longer than classic, and Blizzard seem to have reduced it because of the performance issues their servers have, or because much of the playerbase back then played with really poor settings due to weak computers.
---
I feel you dude. I guess since we're complaining thorium prices fucking tanked on Whitemane in like a week once layers were gone for some reason. DM east probably plays a role, but its also fuckwads who undercut the market by 20s +
---
&gt; Maybe you should read more and complain less. I said "let people choose whatever faction they want and then get sorted for maximum parity possible" NOT "let Blizzard choose what faction they should play.
---
This does not change the fact that more people want to be Horde than Alliance on PVP servers.  Your solution is just sharding on a larger scale but causing the exact same problem you say makes mine pointless.
---
but wasn't it always like that? how did people not choose horde in vanilla?
---
why is this marked NSFW....
---
&gt; vanilla without wpvp is not vanilla
---
oh, just a gatekeeper. Got it.
---
I understand. Wasn't meant in a condescending way.
---
spam hamstring for wf procs?  If you are alliance, don't do it?
---
Dude I'm sorry you have such a personal investment in pupper pals that's gotta be a hard hill to die on
---
Presumably perpendicular.
---
At 60/40 - if you assume BGs last an average 30m - average queues will be 15 minutes, which is MORE than reasonable and wouldnt even give horde time to travel someplace to bother with world pvp.
---
This transcends Flamelash to every pvp server right now
---
Yeah, hindsight is 20-20 bud.
---
It likely costs more money to use their modern servers and purposefully degrade their capacity and make other smaller ones than to just use their current tech and use what insight they thought was reasonable at the time.
---
Everytime you make a mistake, shall the internet get in flames for you doing what you thought was best? Give it a fucking rest ffs
---
Grats my group is working on the same thing. Any tips?
---
Some of the BiS items are crazy ridiculous for people to get, though. I asked about something like this yesterday, and one of the items it suggested at 31 was a quest reward from STV that you can start at 28 but will likely need several level 40s at least to complete, so it's not always the most efficient use of your time.
---
You're moving goal posts. First it was "I don't believe they're close to top of anything at all!" Then "that's a really arbitrary measurement." Then "it's only counting guilds that logged it!!" That's a form of denial.
---
It sounds like all you're complaining about is the color of the items.  High ilvl, especially if they take away warforging, does mean something, even if the items are the same color.  
---
  I personally hope that they remove some of the chores from retail. I like logging in and organically choosing what to do.  I have enough chores to do, I don't need a game giving me a list of dailies, island expeditions, azerite gathering, etc. to do all evening.
---
Yeah I think it's stupid too but the way people act around here I get the feeling they think literally every Horde ever is doing this.
---
No achievements in classic so you’re just wasting your own time
---
It’s more of a nice break from dungeons, raids, and gold farming. Not “all I wanna do”. However it’s not so much a break anymore as everyone is obsessed with honor points.
---
I am saying I saw more of a generally courtesy towards fellow fishers prior to phase 2.
---
ooh right.
---
the kind that only happen on balanced pop server where people of similar level do not gank someone at 50% HP from the quest he's working on and where no  bored max level player stroll in just to mess things up....
---
oh yes, that utopic WPvP, sure.
---
Agree to disagree. This subreddit gives me a headache these days. Alliance players on this sub have successfully ganked me, I'll be taking a hiatus until phase 3 comes.
---
Same with smolderweb. A guild named fairy tale do this shit in the early morning when they think no one is watching them. Some dude always puts them on blast and it's rather pathetic they can get away with it. 
---
They call it "dueling" with the opposite faction but it's very clear they aren't trying and Just win trading.
---
You are very bad ass.
---
Lmao Jesus you guys are dull
---
Actually that's the best part. Yes many people thing every thing should be available, but it's more fun if it isn't, and either you have to do the work yourself, or have to find a way around it.
---
Transferred to Dragonfang and love it
---
Not egos, more like you can't play with all your healer friends at the same time.  At 60 the high quality ones are full heal specced and the ones I've played with have been reluctant to take on a DPS spot so I'll trust their judgement they can't DPS.  
---
The pally is my main man, he can keep me alive through the most insane pressure other healers would low on mana on and he removes debuffs almost faster than I see them in PvP.  If I'm playing with my druid healer friend who needs to run a dungeon over and over I'll stay with him as long as I can but if my pally healer friend comes online I'm going to bail to make sure I don't lose him to another tank.  Maybe not everytime but enough times so my Pally is taken care off and he's there whenever I really need him, except I can't just go about bailing all the time on my druid friend and staying online dungeoneering without a great excuse or coming off as a douchebag.  Then you got a 3rd pally dude who just can't find time to play with but want to try and keep up a relationship with just so he's there when you end up needing him and he's the only healer on.
---
I don’t care about upvotes lol but thanks for the advice good lookin out.
---
It’s Horde vs Alliance in a battle for Azeroth. 
---
It’s the definition of the backstory. 
---
If this were real life an enemy you are at war with ran past you would try and capture or kill. 
---
For The Horde!
---
project much? its a vidya game. this isn't the equivalent of someone cutting you off or butting in line, which is done by people who aren't devoid of fucking meaning in their life.
---
Yep, my mage hit 48 and I can no longer play it.
---
My friend i was leveling with was 48 at the same time as me with 4 days played.
---
He now has 11 days played and only 56.
---
No thanks
---
We pre-pot a Greater Shadow Protection before Golemagg, then a GFPP on the way to Domo. This helps a lot. It’s still intense healing, but it’s mostly focused on just the melee. With everyone being able to go bonkers once tanks get their adds (we have each rank get 1 elite and 1 healer), it cuts the fight length down significantly.
---
35% alliance. I mean that's nowhere near Flamelash levels of bad, but being outnumbered 2:1 is still fucking rough.
---
Who said anything about rogues? When your faction vastly outnumbers the other on your server, you can just run around the city mostly uncontested with your party or raid and pick flagged people off.
---
Better than nothing If you are thinking about being one foot out the door of your server.
---
Truly a one button rotation indeed
---
Saying you *could* care less implies that you do in fact care. Put your WoW penis away and pick up a grammar book
---
They will do battle groups no? It’s still possible to have a big imbalance
---
I mean you could easily just say no and not link your twitch.  Or just not reply at all.
---
LoGiC
---
hey hey thats me the dead shaman!
---
Flamelash Horde are just playing World of Craft now...
---
The real question is whether you can fit through the UC elevator on the wolf vs the kodo
---
&gt; since server population fluctuates relative to time of day, add cross server shard to ensure as equal of a number of people on a single version of the world as possible.
---
Ok so the suggestion is one of two things and I honestly want to know which one you are suggesting because one is the same thing we have now on a more complex system and the other is my idea on a complex system.
---
Are you suggesting that everyone gets assigned to their server and then all servers are cross realm  together.  Then when people go out into the world each zone they go into is balanced equally by faction or balance by every existence of X zone has the same number of people?
---
The first is completely impossible because if you have an imbalanced amount of Horde/Alliance then you can't get every shard to have factional balance.  This is what you are saying is wrong with my idea so it makes me think you are not suggesting this but the other idea.
---
The other idea is that every shard of the burning steppes has an equal number of people.  So if there is an inherent 60/40 alliance split, then it doesn't matter how many people are in the zone because it will still be imbalanced.  If you are just doing an equal player split it won't even guarantee an even split because les say you cap it at 100.  Well what if you got a shard with 80 horde and then 20 alliance.  You want it to balance the factions?  Ok so you get 50/50 in this shard.  But what about the fact that as stated above, there would not be enough Alliance for all the horde to have a balanced zone.  Aren't you still gating Horde away from Alliance, which is what you say is the exact problem with my idea?
---
From all I can tell, you are trying to add a needlessly complex system to recreate war mode on classic.
---
Additionally, the corrupted plants *can* respawn on top of a cleansed plant, although cleansing them will do nothing. It will only make the corrupted plant disappear, and the cleansed plant underneath will keep being on the timer it was.
---
I love that there’s an orc rogue trying to get some juicy honor kills. I respect that
---
In addition, it seems from videos that PVE server players are better geared due to more raiders. Nearly everyone has raid gear.
---

Nope. Classic honor is still worse. Azerite is a annoying grind and all that. Definitely not the best mechanic. But honor is a broken system that absolutely is breaking the game for many people right now. It incentivizes terrible practices that break the spirit of the underdog faction. I hope the release of BG’s will fix it. But I’m worried that with the faction imbalance will cause those on the larger side to give up on BG’s due to the huge queues and continue this camping nightmare.

Good point
---
If members of your group needs to stop and drink and eat after every single trash pull or someone is constantly going AFK, then yeah, depending on how things are going, I might have to bounce early, or maybe just lose faith in the group. Other than the lvl 60 dungeouns (BRD, Scholo, Strat, L/UBRS) there aren't any that take more than an hour, and most less than that.
---
Oh but it is.Its just that alot of people who play classic have played vanilla so they already have a basic understanding. But imagine being a new player. 
---
The rogue dungeon tier 1 set has spirit, so any logical new player would assume spirit is good for rogues...but its not. The survival hunter tree has alot of points in meele abilities, any logical person would think its a meele dps tree...but its best used for disengaging meele, the complete opposite. Hell, warriors get dual wield at level 20 but its a major dps loss because you get negative hit rate, but there is no one to even tell you negative hit rate exists.
---
There is way too much to research on, and most reasonable people would just play the game for fun. This game was made in 2004, there is literally no context for many aspects of the game.
---
One of the first nightelf quests stepping out of the starting zone is to help a satyr. A followup quest literally has an npc saying you'll be considered an enemy by the night elf faction if you dont do their quest. Things like that are enough to confuse any new player
---
Ye
---
Blizzard have really dropped the ball on so many things like this. Some say it’s a little problem. 
---
But there are so many of these little problems.
---
The point is there is no silver bullet. Most people want to play on one of the biggest servers, but they also don't want zones to be too crowded.
---
I suspect people would be more likely to quit from lack of players than they are due to overcrowding and it looks like Blizzard took the same view.
---
you can't blame the no changes crew for this, server pop is higher because blizz thought everyone would quit after a month, then blizz did nothing even though they could see there was massive faction imbalances
---
The answer the PvP goons will give you is that anyone running around in the world has their weapons equipped; fishers are effectively unarmed.
---
The correct answer should be “it isn’t.” But I rolled PvE for a reason.
---
I mean I play solo and have lots of fun questing and doing some occasional pvp but as far as grinding the same dungeons every single time.that don't seem fun at all, at least to me. Even with a bunch of cool mates. Itd just get stale after a while you know. But I was just wondering. Seems like it might be 50 50
---
it takes 5 sec to click on a full server and check queues. why bother typing a comment if you have no idea what you are talking about?
---
three weeks ago:

https://i.imgur.com/Jh4a7SU.jpg
---
i mean if you came to classic expecting vanilla, that's on you.
---
You mentioned you're on Skeram - transfers have been closed for Alliance on Skeram for quite some time now. It's just horde that can currently transfer off, so the concern he's referencing isn't applicable to you perse; in fact, if anything the horde will see some transfers off of Skeram so things will get slightly better for you. I say this being in your same position - the Chad Stalagg/Skeram Alliance.
---
But don't let this lead you to believe things will be massively different. I hate to sound pessimistic, but if you weren't having a good time before I'm not sure you'll have an exceptionally-better time post battlegrounds launching. Just my personal thoughts, for sure to be taken with a grain of salt.
---
Even the action bars are empty
---
I'm on horde, me and a lot of guildies just left for earthshaker as we want world pvp and we heard all the alliance left, I hope more do the same!
---
This is probably one of the dumbest things said unironically that I've read on reddit
---
What happens if you wipe
---
Lol, you simply dont want to understand :D most people choose their faction for very sensical reasons and in most cases there would be no difference ethically in being ally or horde. BUT, playing as an undead monster or a marauding orc would likely attract a few more twats than a run of the mill good guy faction .. in before you once again claim that I said all hordies are assholes..
---
Thank you for putting the blame where it rightfully belongs. I blame the Classsic meta and the playerbase for the state of things. It’s hard to blame blizzard for giving us exactly what we wanted, including the option to transfer realms when queues got too crazy. We would have blamed them just as much if they HADN’T let us transfer. Blizz has given us everything we want all along the way, including the early release of battlegrounds, and people are still so ungrateful.
---
I'm probably in the minority, but I'm in a PvP guild with 3 raid teams that plans to queue with 30 for AV so that we can likely all get in together. 
---
I suspect the Horde Pugs won't know what hit em.
---
The players and 15 years passing are honestly part of the #changes. Without early layering or increased server cap, we'd have about a dozen dead realms merging weekly for the last 3 months now. Server identity would be non-existent with that many merges and/or free transfers.  
---
And the P2 ganking... you might actually find that people would be much more methodical about the open-world honor farm, and that it would still be much worse than 2004 even with the reduced populations.
---
What happened to flamelash? Unbalanced faction numbers?
---
No kids no problem!
---
Yeah I'm 48 and I see no point in playing. On a PvP server because I'm playing with friends but I see no point in the game currently, my time is spent better on a dozen other forms of entertainment. Probably my last month of playing, probably for the better tbh
---
And I agree with the point about faction, it's just about people somehow having the time to sit everywhere in the world and do stupid shit like camp fps and roam in kill squads.
---
&lt;3
---
That totally reminds me of our beloved server  Flamelash EU, it’s just completely different
---
If you played wc3 horde really aren't the bad guys.
---
you literally cant level in 50+ zones as horde either on skeram, due to the 20 man alliance raids in each zone rolling around in circles sniping the flight paths and anything that moves, its not unique to alliance.
---
I don't have kids though that's the thing lol
---
Just my casual observation of course, but it seems to accurately describe my server pop.
---
I cant tell are you with my argument or against it
---
Some mobs in raids are stunnable and improved revenge helps on them. Of particular note are the trash mobs before Onyxia.
---
Actually 3 rogues here. And a few other Horde. Seems some of them came to say good bye. Just did a /who btw and there are 92 people over level 1 online. Truly a dead server :'(
---
It also broke the guild that did it. They were HATED on both sides; anyone with that guild tag got no mercy whatsoever from the Alliance, and Horde would call them out so the Alliance would kill them. They literally pitted themselves against the world with that one act, and the world won.
---
I was told from many nost players that it was.. weird i didnt play on it so idk
---
Now that is an... interesting wrinkle. It makes sense but it feels like it shouldnt be allowed to. Although they did decide to being batching from 2004 in the land of DSL and Broadband to 2019 when reliable high speed internet is the norm..
---
What I listed was the balance across ALL OF THE SERVERS.
---
I love the server, and transferred over in the first xfers from whitemain. I have made a lot of good friends leveling as an alliance hunter. I have even seen some of the same horde and have a lot of respect for some of them. 
---
This server has got more amazing as time has gone on and has become the closest to a vanilla experience then I believe whitemain would have provided.
---
&gt; 20% of those people will get hooked onto retail
---
Based on what, exactly?
---
That still leaves the huge community that Classic brings. It has been around for longer than a decade at this point.
---
There's no reason for a company to kill one way they make money.
---
It's hard to prevent someone from entering an instance.  You have to have split second timing to fear or freeze them.  Nothing else will work.  The item on the ground can be interrupted and probably will be.
---
You're already paying to be in jail by that logic. Unsub.
---
yea but not everyone in vanilla wow was 60 either so its a fair comparison.
---
THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
Battle masters are already in game.
---
What guild were you in? I started playing on ursin. Alliance. I miss the days when you only had to worry about Griefer in menethil Harbour.
---
LOL. No, it didn't. BGs didn't kill wpvp. BGs kill world honor-farming. There is a difference.
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
I agree with you, it was just a little bit of a circlejerk
---
The same people that they are killing now: people who aren’t trying to PVP in the first place. People going to raids, gathering herbs, or even just questing.
---
Thank you for the detailed response! Happy to hear they aren’t allowing transfers off our servers. I guess we’ll have to wait and see if things actually get better
---
Bear tanks can easily out threat a warrior (either) with manual crowd pummelers. The problem isn't threat, the problem is you have to have a taunt land at the right time with the tank, or the debuff will cause a wipe.  Taunts can miss. Warriors gear gives a set bonus to make taunts not miss; druids can't do anything about their taunts missing due to blizzards shitty itemization.
---
If you can't run 40 people through UBRS, it will be a nice 20 minute wait for the first team to kill Rend and open the door to BWL.

---
Blizzard making even the slightest of changes is a slippery slope. And with all the faults the WW classic has, it's still a better game than the current WoW. 
---
You don't want the same people who ruined the game to be "fixing" the original.
---
Not really, we're just not as fast as the Alliance to jump on reddit and have ourselves a pity party over getting killed in a game ;)
---
My realm is way overpopulated with Alliance, but when I die I just log off for a bit. I don't take a screenshot and proceed to reply to comments on a reddit thread about it for days... I got shit to do.
---
I had voiced my opinion on the honor system before launch. It is easily the worst part of vanilla and it's a terrible system, not to mention absurdly unhealthy.
---
All other expansions, including current retail, shit on it imo.
---
We are running on nerfed. All the raids are being released as they were at the end of vanilla wow. MC has been nerfed. I believe even BWL had nerfs and AW for sure has nerds because it was impossible on release. 
---
The raids will get progressively harder, and Naxx SHOULD be what it was many years ago. Of course, with 15yrs of knowledge and theory crafting Naxx will still be cleared by most solid guilds but to the casual raider will pose a challenge. 
---
In the end, no raids in classic with be as challenging as retail mythic mechanic wise. The real challenge of classic raiding is managing 40 players.
---
 Fair enough. ‘Screw retail’ :)
---
lol
---
Those people were wrong then and are wrong now the pvp situation is fine
---
There was a fair share of people just not loading in, or you not loading into the zerg.. it it eventually would happen. There was still a high draw. Not quite bgs but still one.
---
Blizzard is hoping that the people who transferred off will re-subscribe.
---
Yeah, I feel you. Fury/Prot is arguably worse for PvP than deep prot too. Big upshot, both are pretty viable unless you're pushing bleeding edge. Pretty thankful there's many different ways to tank effectively.
---
Throw in healing aggro. Healing does generate threat, and it probably would be fine, but I certainly wouldn't risk it
---
I still find it fun how both are exactly 6% each
---
I like the size of my server. Its "high". I played on private servers with 4k pop (tbc) and they were fucking dead even for a smaller world. (Outland)
---
This but unironically.
---
I honestly think people are underestimating the queue times for horde. Just from looking at ally pvp ranks of people that pass by on a few different servers, there are a TON of alliance that literally do not PvP at all, or very little. There are small groups of players that PvP hard and are rank 6 or 7, but the vast majority are rank 1 or 2 just for the trinket. The flip side is almost every single horde player chose horde because they want to PvP, and almost every single one of them will be queuing for BGs on every server. Just speculation, but we'll see in a week.
---
My man it's a 30 second clip, is that long these days?
---
If you are sticking with a pure dps class then Rogue would be a good contrast. It's also good for PVP and stealth shenanigans.
---
And that is perfectly alright. Some people do dungeons and give loot to the person who needs the bigger upgrade. Some people play less, so they roll on any upgrade. Everyone has dif goals
---
Your monitor must be exceptionally bright or have really low contrast then. On any of my screens this looks way too dark. And the highlights that are there are in way too high contrast
---
Cowardly alliance guilds transferred en masse from an overpopulated server and might kill two servers in their recklessness.  They were outnumbered previously and took so many players to a new server that they will drastically swing the needle on their new server.
---
I don’t necessarily disagree but this is a shitpost, literally serves no point than to cause conflict. Stop it.
---
I think the breath is much hotter than 120 degrees
---
Am in Herod, can confirm queue got worse when layers were removed.
---
Blizz also stated that there really weren't that many layers left by the time they took them out.
---
yah, fuck that elevator.   Leatrix plus helps with dismounts, but it's still annoying.
---
I think the wolf will fit, not 100% sure though.
---
So this guy lives an empty void of a life with no happiness because he danced on someone's corpse in a video game...?

What admins Track that?
---
Red=dead, no exceptions.
---
Armor potions for druids? I have over 11k armor as druid tank. That is enough to reach armor cap (75%) against lvl 40 opponents.
---
The formula is as follows:

Dude, don't tell people, I don't want queue times on sulfuras
---
I understand that some people only play for the competitive aspect, but what bothers me are guilds from private servers like Pupper Pals coming to servers like DD so they can gloat about how great they are after achieving that at the expense of players like you.
---
Zero surprise they're here defending it, other comments talking about how impressive they run Ony.  Must be cool.
---
I don't get why anyone would go deep Prot unless they were MTing for a Guild TBH.  Deep Prot isn't necessary for 5-mans
---
It has been 35/65 A/H for weeks now. So almost twice as many Horde as Alliance. Everywhere that is campable has been camped. A few big guilds decided to move a week ago. Then there was a trickle down effect, more guilds left, the guilds that were left had fewer possible recruits so they moved too. Eventually everyone had decided to move and no one was left.

If you’re into min/max do it!! I’m not against it, just agreeing that I think the min/max thing is a bit over hyped and encouraging OP to not feed into the trending opinion that you MUST min/max.  I am a min/maxer in my mage alt, but not on my main. Sorry if I sent the wrong message.
---
You just mind control them and force them to walk into the lava. 
---
Then they die far from the entrance and have to walk all the way back up the spire.
---
It is if it evades the guards
---
Probably one where he can hit a few buttons then type /dance in a video game
---
This has very much been my thoughts in this. I have always loved the random fights you get while leveling. That’s the best part of the game for me. Both players not fully geared leveling and you jump each other. It’s the best. This iteration of pvp is just stupid. I have chosen to just level alts. It’s impossible as alliance to get into BrD
---
Right.  So if my guild needs a healer for the raid because another dropped, I should tell them to fuck off?  Your party is soooo much more important than the guild I'm raiding every week with.
---
Thank you for ignoring me because you clearly don't understand how the social aspect of the game works.
---
The ultimate thing is about people getting downvoted 6 months ago?  You realize how mindless people are, and downvote after 1 second of thinking?
---
What, are we not allowed to be critical now? While I do appreciate the effort from Blizzard, I think they should have thought more about how increasing player caps would affect the game in the long term. It's undeniable that it's changed the way the game plays.
---
Paid transfers is the last thing we need. We need them to fix the fucking game. Put in faction based queues and put guards at alliance bots. They’ve already gone so far from no changes that we actually need useful changes since they’ve strayed away from no changes.
---
Cool story. The vast majority of the Classic PvP population plays on a greatly unbalanced server.
---
No the alternative is factions queues coupled with faction changes, what they should have done months ago. 
---
Faction server transfers were always a bad idea, if everyone was evenly split every server would be horde dominated, there are simply many more horde players on PVP servers as a whole.
---
Let them enjoy being on top for a bit. It's nice. Players shouldn't be forced to have a bad time playing a game they pay for.
---
Because there is no teabag emote
---
Lmao run run run!
---
I believe you have the best possible weapon setup for this phase and your race. Check out the warrior fight club discord it has the most in depth and current warrior Info. Just make sure to read the faqs and whatnot because those guys will roast you if you ask something that's answered already in the posted info.
---
Mouse wheel up Cheetah
---
Mouse wheel down Hawk
---
Shift-Mouse wheel up Pack
---
Shift-Mouse wheel down Monkey. This is my favorite set-up.
---
Ok but if everyone slowed down would it take less time to reach r14?
---
Cheers boys, appreciate the feedback!
---
No no, my point is that systems exist that induce behaviour in individuals.  I really don't have a choice but to drive a gas burning car and thereby contribute to global warming.
---
An entity much larger than myself, like corporations and government, have to change the system so that I don't have to contribute to climate change anymore.
---
This is the situation we're in.  The systems in place create, require, or facilitate shitty behaviour from other players.  The guys in charge, Blizzard, have to change the circumstances to remove the incentives or requirements to behave in these ways.
---
They do that through faction q and then offer the dominant faction caught in the Q the option to switch server or faction.
---
Haha yes killed me too many times to count, was a GOAT of world pvp on that server
---
What about thrash blade and fire breather?
---
Yeah, the horde camping them, even in major cities, and making their “gameplay” (I use that term loosely) an exercise in futility, had *absolutely* nothing to do with it.
---
The horde killed their own server because they’re so pathetic, lol. If you want to be mad at somebody, look in the mirror.
---
They look like they're made out of nylon. Think I'll pass.
---
BWL wasn't nerfed as bad as MC, but it was still nerfed quite a bit from its original state and I don't think it will be as big of a difficulty jump as some people are thinking.  That being said, AQ40, outside of C'thun, was hardly nerfed at all and will likely kick a lot of these guilds that think the game is easy right in the fucking face.  C'thun was only nerfed to make him mathematically possible to kill and is no joke even comparing it's mechanics to something from BFA.  I'm thinking guilds that haven't been playing on private servers will struggle greatly with AQ40 and Naxx progression.
---
Wu is cool, as is Yip. though Yip is annoying as hell when he ganks lol he still has a good sense of humor in discord.
---
It happens to me consistently. I've tested it. I think everytime I tried to swap between toons, I've disconnected
---
30 yo\*
---
I mean, I have full time job, house, and live in girlfriend, and I got 60 in less than a month. Granted I do sleep deprivation well, and have a short drive to work. 
---
Depends on how many other hobbies you entertain I guess as well. Not saying it's a casual thing but if you don't have much for responsibilities outside of work and you can handle grinding it's pretty doable. Didn't do any cleave BS or crazy XPing.. just knowing where to quest and where to grind were pretty key.
---
There are two casinos on the biggest Oceanic server. Named after the two major casinos in NZ and Australia. 
---
They have dancers and security and barkers.
---
It’s all pretty well organised. One guy twitch streams the rolls. Not a word of a lie
---
This is why horde kills ally in IF
---
That dog looks like the simpsons meme where homer disappears into the bushes
---
In the early stages of our guild (we're a product of 4-5 mergers now) we had an entitled MT that got harder to deal with as time went along. At first things were cool as he was the most geared and probably the most knowledgeable. I was a little slower to 60 than some of the others, but expressed interest in wanting to tank as I had pretty much full pre-BiS'd into prot spec. This guy flipped his fucking shit when he heard the guild talking about putting me into a tanking roll and it turned out he wanted no business in sharing any kind of gear he felt should have went to him.
---
I guess there were already some major red flags from this guy before this even happened which is why our guild wanted to start gearing another tank (me). Guy was gear hungry, didn't want to help anyone unless he could benefit from something along the way, and had unrealistic expectations for our fledgling raid team which was mostly just a casual group of new 60's who wanted to get their feet wet in MC.
---
I would not be where I am right now if we hadn't dumped him lol and I was more than happy to fill the roll. Hope your guild figures what he's all about my man, MT's like that are the worst and are not good for progression going into BWL.
---
Such people should be banned by Blizzard and reported to local authorities, cause they might be antisocial and dangerous.
---
Sucks, but I'd still play pvp over pve even with this experience.
---
How do you see more than 50 people?
---
What you don't see are the undead rogues waiting in queue too
---
Actually blizzard in the past months closed the free realm transfers without any notification. Lot of people were angry that their friend transferred but he can't. Now there is an end date for transfers and we can see what happened.
---
This whole thing has been blown way out of proportion.
---
We do fun things in Ironforge
---
Exactly, it’s really a curse. I find myself hesitating thinking if that’s the best opportunity to pop it. It’s lead to a lot of hindsight 20/20 moments. Recently I’ve just started trying to use it and not think about it as much. I will say it’s starting to feel like I have the ability more often
---
People forgot how much of a grind the honor system is. you need to play like 14 hours a day to get Warlord, I think people are shocked by it
---
It's more forgiving early on for raid tanking. Fury needs a reasonable amount of gear investment to start to pull ahead.  The static threat that shield slam generates is pretty significant coupled with imp sunder.
---
That’s what you get when blizzard screws us by cheap out sourced Chinese call centers reading fuck you scripts.
---
Yeah, I'm actually really anxious to see how it all plays out. I hope for the best, but I'm trying to maintain grounded expectations - my servers forums are filled with horde clueless to just how bad the imbalance is, and I know Skeram has a similar ratio.
---
I believe they MIGHT be Using healcomms I need to check.  I only just recently started raiding with them, so I will ask and download it myself.  That will be convenient, I hate how I can’t see the incoming heals.
---
&gt;unless they were MTing for a Guild TBH
---
&gt; Better than ruiniing everyone elses experience at the same time.
---
I'm not going to continue paying money and sinking time to have a miserable experience so someone else doesn't.
---
Lots of us asked for "this". The faction imbalance is a mistake from Blizzard, not a flaw in the underlying game.
---
Yes, we asked for the roaming rape squads. The FP camping. The corpse camping. The unfairness of world pvp is for me, and many others, the appeal of world pvp. Its organic, its not meant to be hyper-competitive, its just a stochastic war zone that provides opportunity for emergent gameplay.
---
Yah but that makes them vulnerable as they have to stand still and can't observe their surroundings.  There's a trade-off.  View distance, there's no trade-off for hunters, just makes them better.
---
This is so sad... Alexa, play Invincible.
---
Yeah, stance dance is why I play a warrior. It's why I missed classic. I love the mechanic and the tactical feel. I'd never be able to run without Tactical Mastery.
---
I did a paid transfer in Vanilla after Naxx came out.
---
You can turn up all of the setting, but turn "ground clutter" to 0.  You don't have to play in classic mode all the time.
---
Nothing Personal comes to mind.
---
I've learned that all servers were different.
---
Shattered Hand always had a SS/TM war going on until BGs came out. And it was a raid or 2 versus a raid or 2.  Not hundreds versus hundred stupidity that was Classic due to server size.
---
At least you guys usually have Dire Maul, that's better than Alliance on most other servers
---
This was my exact experience in vanilla. Ran around solo as a hunter most of the time and got rank 10. 
---
I can solo in azshara and silithus. Everywhere else I get rolled by 5-10+ man groups and it isnt even worth trying. Like I can land at feralas at 2 am and get steamrolled by 10+ alliance... and we outnumber then on Incendius.
---
If I had to choose between both stats I’d choose the +hit. Big crits are nice, but not missing your Sinister Strikes is even better.
---
lol nah, the issue is the wow community sets the same goalposts for everyone, regardless of how many hours you play.
---
then expect blizzard to meet those standards by offering a way for everybody who subs to get to the goalposts.
---
"feeling like falling behind" is literally only caused by the community.
---
shouldn't 10+ years of code and algorithm improvements make it better instead of making it worse? I guess they didn't make any of those, but just put in shit to slow it down? What are these guys, java programmers?
---
Shhhhh no we don’t, this server is terrible!!!
---
These numbers are only based on people who use the website  [https://www.warcraftlogs.com/](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) 
---
I highly doubt these numbers come anywhere near to what the actual numbers are on servers. My guild just started using this website this week. I’m pretty sure MOST guilds don’t use this website at all.
---
Idk why people get defensive when they get called an asshole after admitting to being one. The whole point is like yeah that's how you like to play but most people don't like griefers, were you just not aware of that?  
---
 Like just embrace it and be an asshole don't pretend to not understand why people don't like you. "Bruh it's a game why would blizzard have allowed me to need that item if I shouldn't do it every time? Why am I getting kicked from the group?"
---
It actually gave me an idea. Why not make "PvP honor" actually mean PvP honor? So someone kills you and upon dying you can choose to use a surrender emote like your saying, and if the other player interacts with it (helping you up animation maybe?) its considered an honorable kill and awards them more honor. Maybe a 5 or 10 minute cooldown on getting further honor from the same player. Allows dying player not to have a corpse walk and camping not being rewarded.
---
No changes tho
---
Wouldn't work in this day and age.
---
There would be too many servers (which would die) and people would flood the same couple of servers leading to insane que times.
---
In that case your post assumes the population of the alliance on "ALL OF THE SERVERS" can/will drop down the 30% because of PVP servers which means your post is still wrong.
---
Also I would like to know where you're getting your data because last time I counted from Ironforge.pro (like last week) the split for the entire classic wow population was slightly alliance majority
---
One costs money and is difficult to do, the other one makes money and is really easy to do.  What do you think Acti-Blizzard is going to do?
---
I understand being frustrated/annoyed/salty but I don’t get why everyone feels this way.  Have you never played a game with pvp before?  The fact that it upsets you is why they do it.  
---
Whether you spend 15 hours a day playing this game or 15 hours a week, all that is happening is pressing a button to piss you off.  The less able you are to do anything about it, the funnier it may be to them. You might have a better time if you don’t take it personally.
---
The Pirates in Tanaris are good for a few levels.
---
you seem to be upset, I'll get you a glass of koolaid
---
Omg I'm so turned on rn
---
Kromcrush
---
Are you trying to do MC with as few people as possible or just don’t have enough to fill the 40 man?
---
We feel the same way about Forti
---
Imagine beeing a mage and cry about balance :D
---
I had an item I needed restored due to deletion. The incident took place a week before I put in the ticket. The item didn’t show up in the list of items that could be restored and the dispute resolution was that there was no record of the item being in my inventory OR the deletion took place over a month ago. Total BS.
---
&gt; Is this GM just **blowing steam up my ass?** 
---
r/UnexpectedGwenithPaltrow
---
Pve servers have way less raiders.
---
IIRC you had to queue as 10 man groups and then cancel out if you didnt all get the queue at the same time.
---
&gt;Classic is not exactly like Vanilla
---
In terms of the underlying game w.r.t. world pvp, it is exactly like Vanilla. All the same rules and mechanics are there. The changes you are referring to are related to itemization, class balancing, etc.
---
&gt;Some of these changes, like the current iteration of world PvP, are NOT what I, or a lot of other players, wanted.
---
NO changes were made to the current iteration of world PvP. It is 1:1 with Vanilla. Everyone who wanted Vanilla wanted this, if you don't like it, it means you didn't really like it back then either. 
---
The ONLY thing that is different is higher populations. Faction imbalance existed in Vanilla too. People complained about zergs and "ermagerd Alliance has too many players" then too. 
---
Higher populations just amplify the experience that was already there. World pvp is not supposed to be fair.
---
That would be why a few of you think its even instead of a worthless garbage fire.
---
A duel is between two people of the same faction and is pre-agreed to, whereas PvP is usually spontaneous.
---
No, it's not.  It's just griefing.
---
No, it will be a group of well geared raiders all willing to stay logged in or otherwise help one person. There is incredible skill involved in PvP, very little involved in getting to rank 14. Just insane amounts of dedication and time.
---
That’s not to say the people who do it won’t be skilled, but that’s not what’s being measured.
---
I like stance dancing (and I think it's a fair mechanic for how strong Warriors are) but I hate that TM feels like such a requirement
---
Name checks out.
---
You're assuming equal participation.  The reality of the situation is that Horde are more inclined to be interested in PvP which is why the population is skewed the way it is.  
---
If it's 60/40 to start, and you have 60% participation from the Horde and 40% from the Alliance (made up %, I have no idea what they'll be) then it's really more of a 70/30 split when it's all said and done.  
---
I think the percentage participation may be even more extreme than my example honestly.
---
I think best case scenario is one in which the que time for Horde is somewhere in the 5 minute range.  It's just inconvenient enough that they might not leave the city to have to travel back again.
---
How about instead of constantly encouraging transfer off we encourage more to transfer in?
---
I wouldn't call the data a rough estimate. It's certainly a large enough sample to have statistically relevant ratios. It has the same h:a percent that the census site says for level 60s for my server, Skeram.
---
The client is optimized in a different way since it can rely on things like sharding to reduce the number of people in a single area. They didn't need to optimize for what classic needs, they optimized for what Legion needed.
---
About a week after Blizzard broke the census addon, it was changed to permit manual /who commands to continue working.  However, it required you to manually click a button repeatedly.
---
About a month ago, the addon was updated again to make it so that as the player plays the game and clicks on things, the clicks trigger the manual /who commands.
---
The result is that the addon is essentially automatic again.
---
Can you comment on what IF was like before this happened? What's the comparison like?
---
If you want to play the nochanges game,  they weren't available until 3 months after naxx launched.
---
Alliance has an easier time with PvE content thanks to paladins so that is going to be a factor, and people who are min maxxing for raids will roll alliance
---
Were you in Stormwind last night around 6pm central? I had never seen so many people in one place (waiting on the buff to drop).
---
Couldnt agree more. The chatbox is pretty much only LFG spams and people getting upset at others for talking in LFG chat instead of spamming LFGs like everyone else. I still find it way more social of an experience than retail, but little things like that just make it seem a bit like socializing is a no no or something.
---
I did not sign up for roaming deathsquads and corpse camping making the game unplayable.
---
I've been on a PVP realm in retail since TBC in 2007. It was never like this.
---
Totem twisting as enhancement is actually not all that preferable, you will mostly stack agi and won't have much mana pool.  Also the only improved totem worth grabbing is str/agi and it can be had while still going deep resto.
---
HAHAHAHA what. Yea good one. There's more people on a server than Nost, which had a 15,000 concurrent peak. 2-3x at that!
---
You should learn to count before you claim that there are 45,000+ people in orgrimmar on a single server. (And really total population is probably at minimum 3x a server's peak. So you're actually saying that there are over 100,000 players on a server concurrently in Classic WoW right now. Sure buddy, keep thinking that.)
---
It runs /who whenever you take an action, like clicking on the screen or turning your camera.
---
What is the point of this reply?  Just move on if you don’t care.
---
The counterweight does work though.
---
dont do it
---
I have experienced very similar story. I will probably never stop thinking about the toons and people I left behind. I am so much happier on this new server I moved to I don't regret moving at all. Plus I can always go back and visit if I feel like it however unlikely that may be.
---
65:35 is 1.86:1. That's nearly two Horde for every Alliance player. I don't know what you consider bad, but imo that's pretty bad.
---
Or given an 8k pop server: 5,200 Horde and only 2,800 Alliance.
---
Owned alliance bitch
---
If it's invincible how can you hear it?
---
Isn't that the point of a game?
---
People don't "usually" (very small amount of people) actually corpse camp one person for 30 minutes.  It's a waste of time when honor farming, which is what people are doing.  You are honorless after a few deaths so one group moves on by and another takes their place, then another group, then another x10. 
---
You seem to think it won't change because it's just the same people camping you for 15 kills, it's not and it would 100% be different if the cap wasn't so high.
---
jesus fuckin christ thats insane
---
Blizzard can just merge realms. Overall for all EU servers Alliance to Horde is like 45% - 55%. According to this: [link](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#eu-realms).
---
Maybe, but some rogues enjoy going with daggers.
---
1.2k for 5 people is 6k mana.
---
Here maybe i can help with a very short reference
---
Mages: are a solid caster class with CC and really good farming AOE wise for gold and leveling they are solid for PVP and PVE. can also make tons of gold with water selling and portals. best race pvp: undead or gnome pve: troll or gnome.
---
Hunter: Very good solo class because of pet you can level with ease. They are very good solo farming gold and have decent CC and good wPVP. pvp: orc/tauren doesnt matter for ally pve: troll or Nightelf
---
Paladin: Sadly never played ally so i dont know much they are mainly healers good for tank healing. Slow to level because of AA pvp or pve not sure race
---
Warriors: Slow to level can farm gold with group pretty well. Once you get gear you wreck in PVP. pvp: orc/tauren/undead dwarf/human pve troll human
---
Warlocks: Same with hunter pet class good for both one of the best 1v1 classes out there. Only real difference is you have fear and death coil for CC and dots for damage. pvp: undead/orc gnome pve: gnome doesnt matter for horde
---
Rogues: good for 1v1s while have really good damage and stuns and to hide because of stealth. IDK how their gold farming skills but you can pickpocket for gold. Also kind of slow to level but you can stealth past mobs. They usually use swords or daggers with poisons for different situations. pvp: orc/undead not sure about ally i think its human same for pve
---
Priest: Shadow is really good for 1v1 pvping. They are primarly healers for everything sometimes you can dps as shadow in groups but mainly heal. PVE isnt bad but not the best they are always needed though. pvp: undead dwarf pve: doenst matter
---
Shamans: Insane burst with Elemental can 1 shot people every 3 mins. Enhancement is super fun because of burst as well with the potential to 1 shot people but very RNG. For PVE they are healers for groups endgame always needed. Leveling is average and you have totems. they lack mobility for the most part but can kite well with Frost shock. Not many ways to make money except for DME jump runs. pvp: orc tauren pve: troll
---
Druids: Great at soloing everything pvp and pve because of shifting into different animal forms. not sure on gold making. but ether way they are usually healers for groups can tank but not preferred.
---
this is very very brief i could be missing stuff but honestly play what you enjoy the most race only really matter for pvp more than pve but play what you like to look at. Because you have to stare at the character for the rest of the time you play. Cant ever go wrong with Orc because they have higher stun resist chance undead for fear break ability and shadow resistance and tauren gives you more hp while having longer range melee wise and a stun ability. Ally have gnome which is usually good because smaller hitbox plus more int nightelf has better dodge and a stealth ability dwarf have a  immunity to Bleed, Poison, and Disease effects with increased frost resistance. Humans are meh but have rep increase and better stealth detection. I hope this helps if you want more details about stuff just message me.
---
also want to put this out there im no expert but i main shaman/hunter so im way more knowledgeable in those 2.
---
How many dozens of times were you ganked? Several? I think not.
---
Nostalgia goggles are a thing yet they dont want to admit it.
---
Solid choice have fun
---
Why are you guys still whining about the corpserun situation? BG's are out in a week.
---
Can't remember the last time I saw a hunter without The Rake or Echyake. Back in vanilla they were seen so much less but now everyone has just read every faq and every guide. There's no more discovery or learning. It's all just metta all the time
---
It doesn't, I made the same mistake thinking it did but it was a TBC addition
---
Mirah's song would be better than Firebreather but you won't get it until you do 2-3 scholo runs at Lvl 60.
---
I don't do this, I just understand that sometimes unexpected things do happen. That's just life.
---
1hr respawn with 3 peeps waiting for respawn lol
---
Holy fuck I wish I had something to give you.
---
People are unhappy about one specific subsystem (that was infamously broken) of the game we've had many months worth of fun on already! Must mean we didn't want the game in general, bring back retail where we don't like any of the subsystems instead!
---
JFc what a post.
---
Problem is... We have to many people really not playing wow as a sandbox and more like a checklist. 
---
They get to the end of their "players guide" and are left wondering when they have fun.
---
Even though post is 97days old, this might be helpful for others too!
---
Weakauras, worked fine for me! 
---
If you have never used it, find a quick youtube video about the addon. I also ended up using this addon for my other classes.
---
Hope this works for you!
---
As long as one faction isnt more likely to raid log, the sample size is represenative
---
Ty I knew you could do that. Thought there was maybe some way to see a full list.
---
Prior to the self service restoration I've had GMs dig pretty far back to help me restore items in the event of being hacked. To me it feels like the purpose of Classics support is to deny people support. Prior to this ticket I filed a ticket regarding brigading when a player encouraged his entire guild to make alts and nuke me with spam for several days and I got a copy and paste about how they cant do anything. People have been sharing screenshots of GMs sending responses with completely different character names on it. They want Classic to be as hands free as possible but the GMs need to be moderating the game regardless.
---
Hey don't forget the horde side! We have
---
- a strong cross guild world boss coalition
---
- new raiding guilds popping up every day
---
- old raiding guilds imploding ever week
---
- Franquito!
---
Or has other shit to do. I'm level 54 and I play almost every day. I just have a job and a family and no desire to rush 60
---
We did it that way as a casual guild with 35 people last week. It's not bad and it's a lot less chaotic than the kite strats we were using before. We AOE the elites down and when all 4 healers come up we have tanks go pick them up and then burn down the healers one at a time out of LOS of the others.

I was working 50 hours a week when I got rank 10 during vanilla. I managed it probably around 15 hours a week or less into rank 9, and then took one week of heavy play, the majority of which was a single night with the HWL group. I maybe got 275k honor that week and got well into r10. 
---
It can absolutely be done casually at 10-15 hours a week, but you have to understand that if you do it casually it won't be fast. You don't have to go from rank 8-10 in two weeks. Wait until you know you've got a couple of open weeks to push, and in the meantime just try to make small progress where you can. 
---
My wife already knows that at some point I'll be dead to her for a couple of weeks, and that's probably not gonna happen until summer, unless I decide to hit rank 10 twice.
---
Horde are dominant on almost all PvP realms in NA at least. Theres also twice as many PvP realms and 9 of the 10 most populated servers are PvP. Of those 10, 8 total are Horde majority. 
---
Horde queue times are gonna be fucked in NA at least.
---
If you primarily run dungeons and also happen to be on a PvP server, personally I would suggest Arms PvP spec.
---
You can run most dungeons at 60 with a 2H, but still have the ability to swap to sword / board.
---
Your rotation in dungeons is Charge &gt; sweeping strikes &gt; zerker &gt; blood rage &gt; whirlwind ( hits 4 enemies all twice) &gt; dstance &gt; normal tank.

It's ludicrously strong for trash dungeons and give you a slight edge in the open world for farming and PvP.
---
If you're raiding, then stay full prot and put on a thorium spike and pull more mobs at a time, use for plate gear if you have it and just smash through dungeons like that. 
---
Fury prot is great. But it's not for everyone.  Mainly main tank in raiding guilds.
---
Completely wrong
---
No because it's a percentage distribution. Doesn't matter if the total honor earned among all players that week is 10 or 100 billion, the system will always assign one player as the #1 position.
---
It is literally impossible to hit rank 14 in less than 13 weeks, and for most it will take longer since it's incredibly difficult to finish first each week.
---
I completely understand what you're saying, but I do still have some confusion here.
---
So I use Rank 2 Flash Heal, this costs 155 mana and with my + Healing gives 570-633 healing.
---
I typically use Rank 2 Heal, this costs 174 mana and heals for 1039-1108 healing.
---
So, the Flash Heal is less effective healing wise, but costs less mana.  Obviously with more casts though, mana gets drained.
---
Most of the healers are using Flash Heal and/or whatever the pally equivalent is, so people are getting topped off relatively quickly.  I tried switching to using just heal, but was having the problem of other healers sniping my heals.  In my first raid, my output heals were really low because I rarely used FH, but I checked details and saw it was what all the other priests were using so I gave it a try
---
Would this just be a problem of us needing to use HealComms to make sure we aren't trying to heal the same target?
---
Horde on Fairbanks here. I spent 12 days early on going morning noon and night to check for spawns. Saw him twice and lost the battle with a few alliance both times. The day I gave up my guildy went and got it first try. Rip
---
ooo what items do you have to reach 11K armor? I'm a fresh 60.
---
I agree.  This post is aimed at shaming the nochanges crowd, but if they had gotten what they wanted, the servers would have been capped at 3k or so players and the problems that are occurring because of overcrowded servers would not be happening.  OP also stated that he couldn't understand how anyone could blame Blizzard, but again, Blizzard decided to wait WAY too long to open up new servers when it was obvious they would be needed from the first day name reservations were available.
---
I'm not an expert but if you want an advice from a random dude :
---
If you're getting a burn-out, it might not be because you're annoyed with your characters, but maybe because you force yourself to play too much when you don't really want to.
---
There is nothing wrong with getting a break and if you think you can get off this pressure, you or the game put you on, with an alt or doing something that chill you, go for it.
---
I truly and honestly don't know why people are surprised this is happening?
---
I played on Darkspear US back in the day, and it was just as bad then. WPvP was more often than not a group vs a loan player or ganking of lowbies.
---
Yeah we all had those great golden moments of massive scale PvP or going toe to toe against a single equal or better player, but largely it was corpse running.
---
This is exactly why I decided to roll on a PvE realm. Because I'm too old, too restricted on time to spend it all dealing with that nonsense again. I kinda just want to play the game and do some raids.
---
Then you're the one that's braindead, because a census takes 10 minutes. The number of people who log on / off in 10 minutes is barely going to affect the results at all.
---
And this entire discussion has clearly happened because you're an idiot that keeps saying the census can't capture everyone who is "online" when you actually mean to say it can't capture everyone that is "active". It definitely captures everyone that is online.
---
It's not different.  It's just worse.  Someone dies, and you have to wait for them to run from the gy.
---
Right, these people think that players that rolled alliance on pve servers are going to have the same participation as horde on pvp servers.
---
Just rolled an orc shaman and I’ve been having more fun playing than I have in probably a decade. My question is: what would be a good profession combination for making a little extra gold and also be useful once I hit 60? I’m thinking I want to focus more on pvp than pve but who knows how I’ll feel in a couple months when I actually hit 60.
---
48 is when you are honor for 60s so high level zones are a pain. Hopefully bgs will alleviate this somewhat.
---
Yeah I'm saving my DKP for that. Just saw another ring Naglering from BRD that does + 3 arcane damage. Just wanna stack em all!!!
---
nahhhh
---
I come from 2200+ arenas up to MoP
---
returned to tank
---
see hand of rag white crit a mage with no barrier up for barely 1k while im enraged, 1.5k MS if Im lucky. I get rooted (for the 10th time by the way) and then I, while in battle stance (because I turn to hit the rogue on me) get frostbolted for 2.5k and fireblasted for 1.2k... 
---
consistently
---
I got hit for a 2,900 pom pyro yesterday too
---
and a 1800 shadowburn
---
annnnd my healers have the same issues
---
everyone is so geared up now that the broken spell power coefficients are really becoming apparent
---
Ill be running in defensive stance then boom, over 3,000 dmg in one cast from an ele shaman as both lightning bolt and shock hit for over 1.6k each
---
and most of the time I cant move and im being spam purged, constantly trying to just move
---
basically I just let my casters do the work and Im like a shiny fish lure to attracted enemies, as at least in defensive stance I can stop 10% of the insane dmg and then let me own casters do all the work
---
my future BG groups aint taking more than 1 warrior, pointless
---
Judgement EU. Low pop. Feels balanced. Sometimes I get ganked, sometimes do the ganking.
---
This is absolutely true.  We'd never hear the end of it about how Blizzard took away our fun and BGs are awful and WPvP was so much better etc etc.  Blizzard *had* to give us a no-BGs patch.
---
That said, letting it run for a full month was just stupid.  Blizzard should have been on red alert after the first few days of 30% of their subscribers being barely able to play the game.  I feel sad that some people got so fed up that they quit, but I do hope that Blizzard lost enough revenue to show them that they can't just sit back and watch a train wreck run its course.
---
Berenstein Bears
---
Totally agree. I honestly feel Burning Crusade had the best class design ever. TM was a baseline skill at that stage and pallies had taunt and could actually tank.
---
haha in these runs the low levels sit and wait for me to either clear a big pull or die to a big pull.
---
Essay \#93892435 from crying Dad gamer reddit armchair psychologist... thanks bro!!!!!!
---
well, a lot of the time tanks want you to give them time to aggro anyway.
---
When his fun comes at the expense of my fun, that's where the issue lays. When I log on and gen immediately ganked because I was just trying to go somewhere to have fun, and then I get repeatedly killed for an hour, and and have to log off because I dont have a lot of time to play games, and I had no fun on wow cuz someone else's fun completely shit down my fun, I think I'm allowed to be a bit pissed.
---
I don't really mind him all that much. Just him in a way that I should as an alliance. I always find it hilarious when hes in the water though pulling some navy seals type shit.
---
Those hordes farming the last few alliance is really the definition of the tragedy of the commons
---
Waited for you to have full heath. What a guy. Super fair
---
No addon. A program called reshade. Google and download IT.
---
&gt; Mages are cried about a lot because a good mage is decent in any tier. That's because the class has a high skill cap. 
---
bahahahahahahahahaha
---
&gt;mage against a SL Lock. It's the way the game works. Go try to kill A SL lock as a mage and you will be just as frustrated
---
because its the most op thing in the game
---
its just that mages are a far higher % of the pop, like 30% or so
---
With 305 skill need 6% hit, if you get to 315 you’ll only need 5% but I highly doubt you’ll be able to get there
---
Not unless you're having fun.
---
It's a video game, my dude. But I say this as someone who doesn't have a dog in this fight.
---
Hell yea and I’m gonna play on a pvp server because that’s part of the fun
---
Same thing happened to me in Vanilla. My best friend and some classmates got me into the WoW rabbit hole back in 2005, except I was a noob and they were already fully geared and raiding. It was like pulling teeth just to get them to help me level or play with me. They said I should make a priest because their group needed a healer, but I absolutely hated it. I decided, since they don't wanna help me for shit, I was just going to go my own way and play what I want, so I made a warrior. And my friend was like "wtf bro I'm already a warrior!". I had a lot more fun. Since then I've always done my own thing, I'm not playing a video game for someone else, I'm playing it for myself and my own enjoyment.
---
By playing the game?
---
I'm not arguing that there isn't an incentive, only that there is a non-negligible amount of Alliance players, who usually gravitate towards PVE servers, that have little to no interest in PvP; even instanced PvP.  It's not easy to get r10 for the full blue set, and it's too high a mountain for a lot of the more casual PVE minded people to summit.
---
Yes I really need an addon for that, it's frustrating not seeing incoming heals.  I do use Vuhdo, but I think I need to fiddle with the settings in it a bit more.
---
I rarely use Flash Heal outside of raid TBH (unless I need a quick heal in a dungeon).  It just feels like a different game in dungeons, I let people get a little low, then I can just heal them for half health with a downranked heal.  Raid feels like we are just constantly competing to top people off quickly.  Sometimes I just throw renews on the tanks, then wand on trash, and I see peoples healing output soar... and no one is seemly taking damage! I don't know what's happening there.
---
Unfortunately our logs didn't work this week, so I can't review that. Hopefully I can get more insight on it next raid.
---
Are you liking incendius or would you go somewhere else?
---
I mean, nothing better going on in their lives?  Same could be said for someone who plays the game normally.  It's how they enjoy playing, you're no better just because you play the way the game was designed to be played.  You're wasting just as much time.
---
please clip and share once you get them.
---
It'll be ridiculous the amount of 18s, 13s and 3s floating on screen
---
Faction doesn’t matter. My server is reasonably balanced, but definitely horde favored - and it’s impossible to play the game as Horde still. My friends that aren’t 60 just quit and will try again after BGs arrive. Everywhere they go - every single zone, even lowbie contested zones - they’re ganked instantly and consistently. Corpse camped and griefed, murdered in every town, etc.
---
Balance isn’t the problem, the nature of the PvP system is. Nothing will fix this except moving to PvE
---
Many horde guilds also migrated.
---
I did that to some poor hunter a couple of days ago, it felt good.
---
Dangerous advice, each additional hour that levelling takes is one less hour you can be farming on a different toon so long run it's a net loss (except for fringe cases) not to gear up your toon unless you're dungeon spamming on it
---
How does one queue for bgs in classic? dont you have to go to a npc in the open world and thus get farmed by 40+ man raids?
---
Horde win out in the world. Alliance retreat to the cities, horde chase them into the cities for honour kills. This is literally the natural progression p2 is actually incentivising this to happen.
---
I think from a lore and RP perspective it's awesome. From a fun gameplay perspective it's a travesty.
---
Lol sooooo salty, why resort to insults my friend?
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I may fiddle around with changing up my talents.  I just chose the most basic holy tree on icyveins and have been going that way while gearing up, but it might be worthwhile to do some adjustments and see how other things will work.
---
Uh... now time to farm some more gold so im not completely poor from respecs ;P
---
A server with a population cap higher than 3k is unique to this version of the game, and that changes everything. 
---
This is such a stupid statement to make.
---
The system is shitty but it doesn't force people to FP camp or relentlessly corpse camp. How you behave is up to you, but you don't forgo culpability because the system is trash. 
---
There are a wide range of behaviors being judged here, not just one. Some people get speeding tickets, some hit other people.
---
What ...  You realize if there were less people it would incentivize THEM to move around in zones more since they would cap out on honor off everyone in the zone very fast, do you even understand how the honor system works?
---
Yep, not only did he camp lowbies 5+ hours a day, he'd emote spam their corpses too.
---
Can't imagine how miserable his real life must be.
---
I miss the old days of world pvp, where you and  a couple buddies would scour the zone for the gold farmers that just ran circles around the zone mining and picking flowers. Even better was the occasional tip that you got that another guild was about to do a raid so you sat in waiting for them to start coming in.  It often ended shortly after it began and the other guild continued on with their raid. 
---
Now it's just greifing, not even pvp anymore, just killing to kill. So that someone can feel better about themselves instead of the pursuit of an actual goal or achievement.
---
I pity the horde of today, they don't know the pleasure of true pvp, only the short pittance of gratification they receive from helping 8 others kill one person as they land on a flight path.
---
Perhaps unintended but those that play horde today actually portray an accurate depiction of those they play. The horde fought till their world crumbled, just as this one might.
---
Dang that must be an odd feeling. On my alt mage I PvP’d a bit while doing solo ZF GY stuff (level 50) figuring I’d just get Scout. Apparently even rank 1 isn’t a given on Gehennas :D
---
Amount of honor doesn't really matter since you're only competing against your own faction on your own server.
---
You can only learn that by reading guides online?
---
Yes. Why wouldn't it count as safespotting?
---
You delete the shaman and pick a warrior.
---
Yup, people killed this game by being such tryhards. They’ve picked every single piece apart, had damn game plans for content pre-release, and generally just took the magic from the game entirely.
---
Found the lowbie ganker.
---
Everyone should leave Flamelash. Let it be like an abandoned mall where you make a lvl 1 toon just to walk around and see what the emptiness is like in Ironforge.
---
And then get ganked by a rogue.
---
Earthshaker had a good 55/45 horde to alliance. Maybe favoured 55/45 to alliance now. Come join the horde over here brother.
---
Bold of you to assume #nochanges people give a shit how anyone else is playing the game... (source: recently hit level 45, and loving the experience)
---
Just because you’re getting ganked/camped doesn’t mean it’s not even. 
---
On benediction, which is horde favored (albeit only by like 5%) I can’t make it from kargath to searing gorge without dying at least twice. Flying into LHC is a deathwish most of the time, but it was fine today. 
---
I expect about 5-6 deaths per run to an instance, which is much better than what some alliance face. If I run with a group it can be better but far more risky (and time consuming).
---
look at you defending a 15 year old re released game on a bastardized version like anything you're doing is new and unique at all lmao
---
I don't think you would be swapping.
---
Exactly, that's what I meant.  I think only the best of best are currently aoe melee, then aoe healers when they pop sheep. That would kill my raiders without health flasks
---
i got one from the level 26-27 fire elementals in Charred Vale the other day leveling my alt
---
Level up - then you can farm faster.
---
Gold is definitely not useless after an epic mount. The only people who gold is "useless" for are probably absolutely insanely farmed and probably played the fuck outta the AH. If you are fury war, there is Flurry and Deep woods that will cost you. LHH. Stronghold gauntlets if you want PvP, then consumables. Then there is the matter of saving gold for consumables in the coming phases
---
Found another gnome
---
But Alliance don't have to participate in PvP in main cities, in faction controlled zones/areas, turning off PvP flag will make you unattackable by the Horde in your starting areas/cities.
---
Like sure, the NPCs get killed, but nobody is at Darnassus for sure, so just go there for your daily business.
---
Yeah, this book was mostly for students, which is why the cover looks like a textbook. I didn't want it to look too "corporate." (Although what isn't corporate these days?)
---
I also straight up tried to tell people that TBC and Wotlk was much better than vanilla. And was downvoted to hell with “FlYiNg MoUnTs KiLlEd WoRlD PvP. Go BaCk tO rEtAiL”. And now those very same players are crying about all the “world PvP. You won’t be getting camped on the way to gruuls lair while you’re sitting on your hippogrpyh.
---
I was considering Earthshaker honestly.
---
I have some friends on Flamelash but honestly.. I really do not want to be stuck on a dying server, even if I have friends on here.
---
So barely controlled chaos with Dots and fears:) sounds fun
---
How do you get level to show on unit frames
---
Mograine EU, really balanced between horde and alliance I feel. People moving around the pvp zones/world changing up who's in control throughout the day. Lots of fun
---
ok
---
It's not worse, you can res mid combat. Plus druids can stealth and do many other cool things.
---
Shaman can self res. That's such an amazing ability to counter a full wipe. Do you think every class should have a self res?
---
Will do, some of the pulls are already pretty intense and fun but that set up would be next level.
---
I'm pretty sure a massive amount of hordes are migrating aswell, making either Bloodfang or Earthshaker (or both) just as imbalanced as Flamelassh was before the transfer.
---
No.
---
Sometimes RNG sucks haha. Awesome you got it in the end!
---
True but if you're trying to rank up and you can only find 1 ally to kill every hour, but your horde buddy found 3 kills every hour, its still gotta be hella boring just to find people to kill, just walking around forever.
---
You cannot auto-self cast macros - i mean, which spell should it cast on you?
---
You have to add another line to do it: /cast [notarget,@self] spellname
---
(or sg like this, not at my PC so i cannot test it)
---
The amount of horde able to freely run brd without being griefed is depressing despite the funny here 
---
If this happened to me instead of dying as Alliance I’d play more often tbh
---
Happens all the time. I've pretty much stopped using fear because mobs will zoop out of draw distance about half the time.
---
Druids aren't really gimped at all. They are pretty firmly middle of the pack with very strong utility. I don't recommend a mixed healing tanking spec because none of the mc/ony fights need it.
---
I use honor spy and farmlog. Honor spy was almost exact on estimating my rank this week.
---
Honestly the only reason to roll on a pvp server is because you want to spend most of your time in some form of pvp. Nothing has changed in the way pvp realms do pvp. If you enjoy the pve content of WoW (as I do) roll on a pve realm.
---
Depending on your class you shouldn't expect any gear in 6 raids in any system.
---
Transfers will be closed in a week. Everyone should get out of hell servers now. It was too late for me but I rerolled and I'm loving it so far.
---
Did you try forming the group? I've found that its futile to say "LFG X", go with guild or form a group, whisper people you see in westfall questing etc. 
---
Be the one others rely on, dont rely on others.
---
in that example, I would say it's not worth it because of the long delay after switching back to DW.
---
However, I do this all the time when tanking by opening with a WW with a 2H, then switching back to defensive stance and 1H+shield. In my case, it doesn't matter because the gcd is not enough time for me to lose much threat.
---
But you never use it for that in 5 mans.  You almost always use it to res someone out of combat, which also wastes a reagent.
---
That's a funny way to spell mind vision
---
Sure
---
Make sure they're gnomes, that's the only body count that matters.
---
Fucking TRUEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Go back to posting in gonewild, these are legit issues.
---
Pretty dumbass post imo.  
---
The only reason this is a problem is because server populations are massive.  Instead of 3k people spread across the world you have 25-30k.  The world is the same size, just has 10x more people in it.
---
Instead of 10 people camping around BRD you have 100.
---
This is exactly why people didn't want changes - unintended consequences.  Why on earth Blizzard thought massively increasing the server populations was a good idea is beyond me.  Just no foresight whatsoever.
---
&gt; One of the most interesting things to me is how the modern player constantly complains “there’s nothing to do”. Which is totally true there isn’t a whole lot to do content wise. 
---
This kind of blows me away...
---
I'm playing two toons, both are 40-45ish and the amount of content in STV alone is incredible IMO.
---
Right before tbc, I can agree to them doing the same this time around
---
Is that a vibrance and saturation slider? CRANK it to 110!
---
I have been underwater so much time with the hydrocane that I know think nagas should be a legit playable race on wow haha
---
I hope you will get it bro
---
C'thun would be the equivalent to a mid-raid boss in retail, it's really not that mechanic intensive compared to most recent last bosses (with the exception of Xavius which was a cakewalk).
---
can some1 write me "unequiped weapon and bow" macro
---
and "feign death unequip all gear macro"
---
[That was me](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dztf0o/my_main_issue_with_world_pvp_is_that_players_are/f8ajnit/) actually!
---
Gnomercy!
---
Thanks! Yeah, I wanted to humanize the development process, and I think I did a fair job reaching that goal. 
---
Half the team left after the game was made. All the non-MMO geeks were sick of working on the same project, leaving all the MMO geeks like me behind.
---
Be thankful you learned it here and not on a job application.
---
How many online Horde side?
---
Solid argument
---
Go to Earthshaker.
---
They fucked it up by wanting honor? By playing the game as it was intended?
---
Flame lash I was alliance on that server until 2 days ago , what happened was .. we were getting camped at every fp n boat , one of the big guilds decided to transfer n it snowballed within hours the top 5 guilds left then in the next 24 hours they all left to the same server , that server now has about 500 alliance in if at any time it’s insane ... but it doesn’t end there the horde have figuredthis out and have now started to transfer to the same server !
---
What's the moving portrait addon called?
---
You don't need all the BiS... the website also lists great alternatives
---
Just reroll and transfer later when it's available. The levelling to me is fun, so I don't mind.
---
Wrong. Some folks just want to make the horde great again.
---
That wasn't him yelling
---
i just want to settle down on a nice RP server... long time roleplayer that let myself get convinced that i needed to play on a pvp server to have the true classic experience
---
The only servers (or games for that matter) that are trash are the ones *you* don't have fun in.
---
The book has plenty of flavor text.
---
retail version?
---
I'm alliance on Herod which seems just as bad, no mass Exodus that I've heard of so far though 
---
Many are hoping BGs improve the scene
---
[Flamelash near midnight.](https://i.imgur.com/mUBfeXy.jpg) There were a total of 12 level 60s online. RIP.
---
Iirc esfand released a video (furring beta) where he showed that you need to be already sitting and then stand up again just as the mob hits you. I guess it have to do with the sit forcing the crit but game also register you standing in the same batch.
---
On p servers I've heard you could just sit and it would work.
---
I signed up for pvp.
---
This isn't pvp.
---
How long did it take to get down that far? 
---
Cause that was WAY far down there.
---
Your literal first post is a chick holding up a fruit? Good one fella.
---
I know a lot of people went Earthshaker
---
Aye?
---
Sounds like it'll be Earthshaker then bois, you'll be getting a spicy nature boi shaman joining ya soon.
---
Wouldn't it be on Blizzard for releasing ranking w/o BGs?
---
Just see it as a system where the flow of players coming in on each faction needs to be equal to the flow of players leaving each faction.
---
When one side becomes large, it gives advantages, like more safety in the open world and more players to group with.
---
When one side becomes smaller there aren’t as big advantages. Less competition for honor ranks maybe? There are big disadvantages though: being ganked more and less players to group up with.
---
Therefore, most servers naturally trend towards imbalance. Blizzard needs to introduce a system that makes small factions attractive if they want to prevent this from happening.
---
To be honest blizz could just make it so that free realm transfers open up, faction specific, in every way that improves balance (like allowing horde from &gt;50% horde servers to transfer to &lt;50% horde servers), or because these opportunities are scarce because of the lack of alliance-dominated PvP servers: even when people go from one with a worse imbalance to better imbalance (like allowing horde to transfer from 80% horde to 60% horde servers). Just every 3 days announce on some page: For the next three days these are the possible transfers. Also allow faction transfers if it improves the balance in the same way.
---
Of course, this wouldn't fix everything. But at least it would just make things better. It should be very easy to program, there's no real reason not to do it except lack of will. Your idea is good; the problem is that Blizzard doesn't give a fuck probably.
---
In fairness, one of the head honchos played a paladin and could single handedly see that by the time they finished buffing a 40 man the first buff would've been about to wear off and how utterly absurd it was that a mass blessing didn't exist
---
1 hour respawns for a random one or every one respawns every hour?
---
What's the typical raiding time you think ?
---
You hire goons, the enemy brings more.
---
You're right. I just realized you can search different items. I thought initially it just put whatever BiS was at that level and only that.
---
Free transfers all the way down
---
Eazy mode allies
---
There’s tons of posts and comments and on this Reddit all day talking about how people are bored and basically just raid logging. You can very easily find these posts yourself.
---
When I first started it happened nearly everytime. Stay In LOS of king at all times other than when you aimed+multi him. The 2nd from the bottom pillar, bottom left corner of said pillar. It still happens occasionally, but it's manageable. also i've heard things about the 5 set giantstalker setting it off because it counts as an aura or something.
---
&gt;This is exactly right. People claim there’s “no reason for tanks to run Strat”, when mostly what I remember from Vanilla was fucking around with friends doing dungeons for no reason. We didn’t know what BiS was (other than T0) and were happy to see what dropped next. Now it’s all mined and nobody wants to do anything for the heck of it or for fun. What is fun if not running a dungeon with other gamers like you? Once you get your gear, or your rank, what is it all for?
---
I still do this. I'm basically all pre-bis and a few raid drops but I log in for a few hours every night and do random dungeons and help people out. My d guild was so shitty.. there was only like 8 people on during non-raid nights and then they would inspect you for enchants and schedule sign ups for 2 different raids. 
---
I don't understand the point of only playing a few hours a week and then logging out but hey to each their own.
---
Came here for this.  It’s situational.  If you’re questing on elites 2-3 levels above you, you can’t afford Garrote. You need to have the ability to gouge or blind into a bandage.  
---
Admittedly I should probably stop cheap shot opening for warrior tanks. :/
---
There are no hostile guards that they are evading, which is what I understand makes something "safespotting".
---
Nothing like blowing 5g in consumables to beat someone farming
---
I think "no changes" is stupid
---
we should have had the old core game (i.e. no cross-server LFG, old loot, old social environment) but the game should have been modified more to fix problems (i.e. mages, SL locks, Spriests, being pretty OP). And honor is one of them. 
---
But, I dont think that is the main reason we have problems. The main reason is blizzard NEVER considers the impact player pop and balance has. They were content with leaving horde racials overpowered and 9/10 of the PVP servers leaning heavily horde. They were content with providing horde transportation w/ guards, but alliance ships w/ none. And that is why it sucks. A balance population would help tremendously.
---
That is what you are not getting, there isn't a time where you can play the game. Plenty of times for you is every second on the server for us.
---
Happened to me with my 2nd ever found lotus, right after the fail the alliance who controlled silithus jumped me, I'm still tilted.
---
Come to Westfall, start over.  They need more Horde, but we will take you as Ally if you wish.
---
I’m in one of those guilds we couldn’t leave the city’s everyone was only raid logging , officers had a meeting , we decided to move told some of the other guilds then it snowballed to oblivion everyone left within 24 hours
---
Third for Atiesh. High pop but I’ve never had a queue so far. 30ms ping from California too.
---
I'm almost positive that you rank up quicker from having a high standing each week. That standing is shared with both factions, not just alliance or horde. Therefore it's the same difficulty for both sides to advance their ranks.
---
It’s a hobby. You could say “bird watching” won’t do anything for you but for people that enjoy it they could tell you numerous ways it benefits them. Wow as part of my routine has helped me cut down on drinking, going out and wasting money, and through guild and raiding it’s also been a team building exercise as well as a confidence booster in overcoming anxiety when chatting with others online.
---
&gt; These days that’s apparently unacceptable to players they constantly need some sort of carrot to chase. Which sort of gives me some insight into how retail transformed into what it currently is
---
and that type of game sucks ass and gets old really fast for many ppl, especially ones that arent 12 anymore
---
I actually quit at level 35 because of this.  
---
I joined a guild and they were doing MC within like...a fucking week.
---
I was like....you realize there's not much else right? You guys know that....right? 
---
But it's all a race, and a grind to get the best gear and be better and bla bla...
---
you know what? I did that shit already over a decade ago...I went to altaholic mode after we downed nef server 2nd racing and playing that game. I didn't need to do that again. Why was I grinding 2+days played within a couple weeks for this? for what? 
---
All I wanted to do was putz around in vanilla and play some old characters and do dungeons with friends and shit. But most of those people aren't around anymore, and there's not many casual guilds anymore, and the thirst in the PvP is absurd, so I just cancelled. but hey...I wasn't really super stoked waiting on classic anyway so w/e. It was a fine month.
---
I can't believe all these crybabies have downvoted my comment xD People are so narrow minded. "IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT".. what!? The honor system is broken, not the players. Every lvl 48+ player is basically a resource to be mined. And without BGs there's no other way to "mine" these resources besides the open world.
---
Transcendence EU
---
He's probably enjoying life more than people who pontificate about the human condition whenever somebody has fun in a video game.
---
I feel bad for those people.
---
Go spend time on an alliance dominated server and see how fun it is. Or are you a coward?
---
If they are using terrain to avoid the guards being able to path to them...its an exploit and needs to be reported.
---
Lol, im  the gnome in the middle talkin
---
I just almost died to Warlock DoTs while flying and it got me thinking.  I've never died mid-flight before and my only guess is that you would just lose your flight and your corpse would be on the ground directly below wherever you died mid-air.
---
crusader also isn’t necessarily as good bc of the lack of consistency in uptime. in pve where you’re wailing on stuff nonstop it will be up all the time and great, but that’s not necessarily true in pvp- you’re going to have shorter fights with more time in between them more likely
---
Even if you're playing semi casually up until rank 10, it is still going to take a minimum of 8 consecutive weeks to go from the beginning of R10 to R14.
---
If you want R14, you'll be grinding like it's your job for at least 2 months straight. Maybe if you're on a dead server with no rankers you'll have an easier time, but you still need to put in the weeks necessary since your progress is capped each week.
---
&gt; imagine if counter strike took a 10v10 map, and turned it into 30v30map
---
that would be awesome
---
however if that 30v30 map was 40v20 instead, then it would suck, and that's what we have
---
Lol that’s what I thought
---
^
---
Yes because it hits hard AF much better than 1% crit. For PvE at least
---
Positive post upvote!!
---
LOL I literally posted that picture in what the fruit! I was curious to what it was.
---
Its always funny the people that call others "salty" seem to be full of naCL.
---
No it’s not. It’s a corpsathon for ally.
---
alliance often let horde quest among them, horde never did
---
horde are scumbags on my server, and its slowly turning all the alliance into scumbags too because we all got sick of it
---
Charge, Sweeping strikes, Berz stance, whirlwind, demo shout (helps offset the damage incoming from berz stance, if youre having an easy time living and healing, use battle shout), cleave all of your rage away until WW off cooldown.
---
Youll do mid-range DPS and keep threat on you.
---
Ya enjoy not having any opponents lmao
---
I have tried that as well. No change. And the times I have successfully killed the king I have used distracting shot.
---
A lot of us don't care. We've had our wpvp fun in p1 and p2, now come BGs so we barely have to step outside of our cities anymore.
---
Lol enjoy the alliance free server
---
I love posts like these, where they quote "no changes" but then ignorantly forget to mention that blizz released classic with basically all game adjustments/fixes that came Literally at the end of vanilla but called it "classic release"  
---
By the end of vanilla the game was easy, difference is, we didnt have an end of vanilla style game to play right off the bat. There was no spell damage on every piece of gear, agi on cloth was a real common thing, MC gear had the opposite faction loot and all the other things that made vanilla "hard" which wasnt due to difficulty but due to just a game being launched and tinkered with with time isnt there this time around.  
---
As a fuckin paladin, I literally roam solo on whitemane. I hardly ever deal with these "raids of horde" and if I do its for less than5  minutes or just at specific flight paths.
---
well no back in old EQ you didnt drop items, your corpse kept your items
---
There was no "Ghost" run back to ur body... you ran back.... with no gear... fully able to be killed again
---
if you did not recover your body within something like 32 hours... all your gear and body... poof'd into non-existance
---
Add in that every death also caused XP loss..... it was brutal lol
---
Even current EQ and the TLP(Classic) servers respawn you with ALL your gear ... instead of forcing the naked run lol
---
Yeah that was my point to the others here, I don't think aoeing down the healers is yet possible. Everybody seems to be spreading them out or pulling then back. I'm sure some high end guilds can with flasks.
---
Sounds really fuckin stupid. Sounds like a competition of who has the least amount of responsibilities so they can put the most hours into WoW.
---
I kid you not, but that's me!
---
Thank the gods a kind lv 60 mage told me to change server ASAP, as it was dying
---
yea having +weapon skill for ranged isn’t as important bc there’s no glancing blows :)
---
Isn’t that Horde dominated server? Alliance are probably taking a break.
---
&gt; #NoChanges would've included not increasing the server population by a factor of 10. That's the real problem
---
**NO IT IS NOT**
---
the problem is the faction imbalance
---
Im on one of the fullest servers and its totally fine until you get out into a zone where the horde outnumber your side 4-1
---
but the moment some alliance pvp groups show up all is fine
---
Wheres the joke?
---
Ive seen this thread 400 times. This subreddit is the same thing every day with so many of these posts. I still read all of them though...
---
As a rogue I’m loving P2 so I cannot relate
---
That's like the youtube videos that give credit to the copyright holders
---
Got it in under 30 hours, considering myself blessed.
---
Flying.
---
Hard disagree. There were times were me and many guildies were logged in and not actively farming for shit for weeks at a time. We were simply feeding into the guild drama of how Susie drove 150 miles to fuck Joey the warlock who lived in another state while she was dating dan the GM.
---
This makes me miss Rappin' the Forums...
---
Big if true.
---
1 in 100 runs maybe.
---
That might be it! At least an interesting theory. Could you elaborate on what you mean by linking?
---
Got it while leveling. Was in the area questing, saw him up, swam down killed him boom tidal charm. That was a month ago.
---
Who says it is directed at you? I also play horde and it’s 3 ally’s to 1 horde
---
The problem is NOT the honor system.. the problem is that blizz did an awful job managing server populations and willfully let the pvp realm populations ruin themselves.
---
It’s almost like they tried to kill the pvp servers. Everything about opening those transfers was stupid as hell.
---
Shadow priest with affliction lock. You just dot the Fuck out of everything. Then when you close the pull on yourselves  fear em away. Easily kill 7-10 npcs. Hit the lock a renew, starts tapping. You drink they make the next pull, you can go on forever.
---
Did the druid cause all the melee to get tossed or was it just the druid that got knocked back? The single target knockback doesn't affect anyone else and also is good for the druid to get hit as there's less fall damage from it in cat form. 
---
Been an interesting question and seems nobody really knows the answer to this that I've found so far. Guess I will just stand over to the side just in case. The only reason I don't like that is the single target hit sends you way off in the lava likely to die where the other spot you land on the ledge.
---
&gt; On the higher pop servers/factions it could end up being a crazy grind just to get rank 10.
---
Can confirm, on Herod I was putting in 30-40 hrs first couple weeks and the RP I was getting put me on pace to barely get R10. Not even close to a 'casual' rank.
---
its not the pop count
---
its the balance
---
if pvp servers were actually 50/50 and not on average 70/30 horde favored because of OP racials, youd see much less problems
---
as it is, when alliance groups pvp in a zone its no problem, as horde are shitters and scatter like roaches
---
the issue is that 9/10 times, the horde just outnumber alliance 4-1 in each zone and camp alliance so they can get 2 honor
---
You would probably hear someone laughing maniacally in the distance.
---
R14 is the one with weapons, which is the make or break item for warrior/rogue/pally
---
Yea happens more then you would think it’s crazy. I’ve done it too by not reading the item description properly! Thankfully on BOE items though. 
---
I still haven’t killed princess for her healing gloves cause I’m scared to do it without a trusted guild.
---
I had someone in my group go guild needs me and leave group.
---
So then I asked in guildchat why he had to leave and he got all pissy saying I was trying to create drama lol. Some people...lol
---
I like that in a game that is regularly denigrated by people for being played by "people with no lives", there is still a hierarchy of nolifers, with varying degrees of no-lifing.
---
I think youre not wrong; but on the ohter hand; pve servers or dont play games when nolifing is rewarded; i also thought about quitting wow classic for good cuz i cant dedicate as much time as i feel id need; exactly same reason why i stopped playing retails as i didnt enjoy 4 hours wipe mythic raids or doing dailiies and weeklies for rest of my life
---
Anytime someone dies, I doubt that's 1% of anyone's runs.
---
You don't even need 4pt3. There's enough slack to allow for a taunt to miss and still be ok. How this myth got so pervasive I will never know
---
Clever chemistry pun? I guess?
---
Sure ya were buddy, keep telling yourself that.
---
It’s a joke, so laugh. Just be glad you didn’t get flamed like everybody else does when they ask a question.
---
Takes me 45 min to get to bed as horde... interesting
---
Got it within two days very early on.
---
There’s posts in this very thread stating the very thing. You didn’t think shit you can barely read.
---
How do we gain honor without killing the other faction? We didn't know what the faction balance was when we rolled our characters on day one.
---
So if you scroll up you’ll see my first paragraph that states “10-20” hours minimum. Followed by the one you’ve just responded too which tacks on additional caveats - i.e. it’ll take 2+ months of consistently farming BGs at that rate etc... I think comparing vanilla to classic is apples to oranges at this point. It’ll be more competitive this go around, at least on high pop servers where one faction can have as many players as an entire realm did in 2004.
---
When you say stay in LOS you mean to hide right? So would I jump down before the pet pulls then keep him losed on a pillar?
---
Congrats, you mined all your resources up now. Funny how that works.
---
this isn't a raid, it's an occupation
---
I don't get the whole "there's not a lot to do". I'd be ashamed if my RL friends found out how much time I've spent on this game. Yet I'm nowhere close to wrapping up all the endless preparations for upcoming phases regarding gold and consumables.
---
that was a needed change
---
without it, 80% of the servers would be dead, and vanilla was a player's social game, so without ppl the game just dies as the content is the other players 
---
the problem is that pvp servers are often 70/30 horde favored, so out in the world an alliance easily deals w/ a 4:1 ratio and cant do anything
---
when alliance groups actually pvp in a zone, its easy to to stuff, as the shitter horde all scatter like roaches when they cant camp ppl for 2 honor anymore
---
That's super interesting, are you aoeing all 8 at once with the double protection pots?
---
Xavius tuning was a joke, but he was still mechanically more complex than c'thun.
---
pro tip : use rank 1 or rank 2 fear instead for shorter fears on NPC mobs
---
I assumed imp was preferred for dungeons due to stamina buff? I’ll try succubus tonight
---
&gt; And corpsecamping is not always that common in WSG (it happens occasionally when they are having fun) but it does happen a bunch in AB when they just take all the bases and corpsecamp until the BG ends.
---
A 5:0 [Arathi Basin](https://i.imgur.com/mr5WKMF.png) is over after 5min. It's faster than WSG.
---
You do understand that BG's will be cross-realm
---
Diminishing returns in BG's may be true to oldschool and be 10 kills before falloff
---
Classic runs out 5 kills before zero honor
---
If you honestly think they wont make battlegrounds MORE lucrative if people don't shift... well i dunno then lol
---
Also, a win in WSG is a flat 140 honor
---
most BG groups can earn a win every 6-8 minutes, add in the honor kills... and the marks of honor you can turn in
---
WSG BG will net you far more honor per hour... at a steady rate... then BRM will
---
Infact right now i beat out the BRM groups just solo farming honor on kalimdor in ungoro/silithus/ferales.....
---
you NEED at least 300 people to get at least 15 hks a week, the faction might be so dead that this wont happen every week which makes the r14 not achievable and even if theres 300 ppl playing you gotta be the literal #1 standing for a month straight
---
48 is the new 60; hit it and suboff
---
What halo reach map is this?
---
I personally think those transfers would be a great idea, if only because I give zero shits about the experience of deathball rampaging through every zone and calling it PvP.
---
I haven’t logged in to my PvP realm since the first week of P2... which I play horde on a horde dominated server. I don’t get ganked, but I also can’t find *any* fun world PvP. The alliance numbers are dropping to almost nothing and horde deathballs are in every zone and every boat. The zone chat is all children loving how mad alliance must be and calling out where the people they’ve camped 5 times are so that someone else can come take over.
---
Those people are the reason servers suck right now. People are just blaming blizzard for not actively stopping it, which is fair to a point, but I have no qualms about leaving them to the the mess *they created*. I give no shits about preserving their experience when they have shown exactly how little they care about anybody else’s.
---
Faction based queues might have made a difference from day one, but now? I don’t know if what’s been done can be fixed, and for those who had a game they loved utterly ruined because “we can”? They deserve to leave without having to abandon all their progress.
---
Personally I’m sticking to my PvE realm until something changes, though I doubt it will any time soon.
---
I’ve liked incendius so far
---
Characters doesn't always tell the tale, a lot of people are raidloggers.
---
Best option - click on activity and look at active characters at the same time.
---
For example my server, we show 50:50 split for characters, but alliance are HEAVILY outnumbered in the open world.
---

https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?realm=4700_Kirtonos
---
Y'all are so fucking dramatic... if it was/is that bad, you should transfer or make a new character. My server is 35H/65A (by our guesses) but there is still peak hours and non-peak hours, so I've been getting in a good amount of profession time (not much leveling... but that's P2). Stop acting like it's a personal attack on you because you can't play a game. Acting like fucking 5 year olds.
---
55/45 is bad, 60/40 is very bad (1.5 horde for 1 alliance), 35/65 is "get me outta here" kind of bad.
---
You die in real life
---
yes but even non jerks are being jerks... and i cant entirely blame them
---
everyone has a point value on their head atm....
---
What you think both sides weren't ganking the shit out of each other from the the start of phase 2? Except it looks like horde outnumbered ally almost 2:1 so I can pretty much guarantee it was way worse for them
---
&gt; https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters
---
Holy crap, why is that site such a laggy piece of shit? What the fuck is the point of that animated background.
---
No Rag knock back with 315+ FR?
---
Can’t you just blow up a clothie / healer and vanish + sprint out?
---
Even just locking up a healer can be enormous in a skirmish. You need to not think of yourself as a DPS and more of a “controller”
---
Horde spergs brought it on themselves.
---
Which is good, we don't want earthshaker to be heavily dominated by alliance. It seems to be in a good place right now.
---
Try looting the STV chest. I'm still getting flashbacks from all the rogues popping out of nowhere.
---
Source: finished my AGM yesterday.
---
Yea was watching frost live last night rank inside IF. Even he thought it was ridiculous what they were doing and just kinda has to shrug his shoulders and say “it’s sad but this is the meta”
---
Along with just being totally fair and saying this is no real fun for anyone and that there just overall ruining the game with this patch.
---
Hey Gordo, your life is a failure and move out of mommies basement. - sincerely your local neighborhood go fuck yourself
---
LOL ok pal.
---
And if your a warrior follow the Fight Club discord and this excel: [BiS Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?sle=true#)
---
They wont be able to do this bullshit on a full server tho, they are sooner on the graveyard than they can hear the if music
---
Are you for real? The game is very known and nothing is new. How can you even say the efficiency is the same as the real vanilla LOL. 
---
And you give runescape as an example, in the real 2007 everyone was a fucking noob compared to the Old school runescape launch where everyone knew the game and how to play it.....
---
Kurinaxx is a great west coast alliance PVP server. We fight the horde at every corner and no zone is ever controlled by either faction. anyone looking for a semi real wpvp experience this is the server
---
DOOM SQUAD in the house! :D
---
That’s the thing with you people. It’s not a need, it’s fun because it pisses you off
---
“What do you call people doing 40+ hours a week?” 
---
Fuckin losers lol
---
&gt;can't leave capital cities as ally
---
&gt;can't level in 50+ zones as horde
---
Those aren't equal
---
I know right. Dagger war is pathetic. Almost as bad as ret paladin.
---
Imagine expecting people to reflect and take some small responsibility for their own actions or those of their collective in-group. Nah, easier to just blame Blizz lul.
---
Lol uhhh, read what *you* wrote hahahaha
---
Coming back at him with the ole ad hominem. Classy!
---
I was just on the server. Several hordes camping IF. Looks like they got what they deserved.
---
Mr. Herbalist... I don't feel so good...
---
Sorry but this wont happen. just like how when im leveling on my 45-47 and i still get melted.
---
Being able to keep your hearth at your grind spot (tanaris for most mages) is also supremely helpful
---
Sell herbs (or ore) and buy the elemental fire, every mob that drops it at a decent rate is farmed constantly by 60s.
---
it technically is as it takes 5 min of time in a city to unflag. GL with that when you login/portin/flyin and instantly die
---
We got our 6th Rag kill Tuesday, and also cleared Ony in the same night; first time to do all 11 bosses in one evening. So yeah, not looking to set any speed records. We're pretty cool though. Good group of people.
---
Where does that start tho
---
In before "he must be on PVE server" comment
---
How do you play with all that crap scrolling on your screen?
---
AB sure I agree GY push serves a viable purpose, for 90 secs, since 5-0s end that fast.
---
Not all heroes wear cloak's but in wow they do!!
---
You've gotta understand that before games had micro-transactions; this was how Blizzard soaked the player base in a sub based game. Make everything long, slow and painful. It worked back then, but I'm not sure if in today's landscape how long peeps will tolerate it.
---
 Kurinaxx is a great west coast alliance PVP server. We fight the horde at every corner and no zone is ever controlled by either faction. 
---
Would highly recommend it and the guilds are good too. good server community not a lot of drama very active discord too
---
Honor starvation?! Lmao THAT’S their woe?! 
---
The other side can’t even play the game. What a fucking dogshit argument
---
What's the addon called?
---
If it's anything that I don't like from modern wow it's the azerite/essence grind.
---
Yeah I was confused because for the last two weeks my trek to Diremaul has been met with the lovely Thingone-five warlock multibix stack, Gault the mage and his cronies, and about 30 other alliance looking for blood. If you're not seeing alliance controlling DM my assumption was we were playing on different servers lol. We must play at different times. Sorry to hear rogues are doing their selfish cancerous thing. I just want to farm my mindtaps to be a better raiding healer.
---
Flamelash is now dead. Imagine being as wrong as you were.
---
How do you log a raid? Everytime I use the Warcraft Logs Uploader and set it to classic and then start the log for my raid and when I finish it, it gives me an error telling me nothing got logged.. I already have advanced logging enabled
---
I’m sorry to hear that, as a Skeram refugee myself, I know your pain. I guess when you don’t take part in, or fall victim to, insane ganking/pvp, you don’t realize what’s really happening.
---
You don't die. It just takes you to 0 (or 1) health and does nothing else
---
X Pearl Unit Frames
---
Good dps is always wanted.  Not as much needed for pulling unfortunately
---
That won't help at all, the dominant faction would be spread out as well.
---
Right? Fishing is one of the most competitive gathering professions. You wanna go fish in Azshara and not kill the other players there who are fishing, they're going to kill you instead.
---
Yup, there were even add ons so you can click the flag and instantly target the flag carrier even if you were across the map.
---
People would do this to make it more easy to find the enemy flag carrier as well as watch their health to get ready to turn it in.
---
White knight for sure.  I’m actually curious about how many people will actually stay.
---
What ability is that?
---
On both. Natch. 35frost pvp and 40 on pve. Still having fun. STV is an experience.
---
Bro jus play on a pve server if gettin ganked tilts you that much, you can opt outta pvp situations altogether
---
Well I guess it all depends how into the raid scene you are, I suppose we just don’t share the same mindset when it comes to life at 60. Cheers!
---
I noticed the odds were usually on my side after a week, but what was I supposed to do? Watch my rank decay?
---
Like dance is some big insult...?
---
Or blizz could do nothing,  I bet that's what they'll do
---
As far as PvP, no server is ever going to stay balanced.
---
People roll on them to win fights and gank.
---
If they are in the minority, then they stop logging in and/or move somewhere else.
---
I never would have believed they'd eventually upload it all to streaming services, what a wonderful time to be alive
---
Most moved to ES from what I heard, including my guild. Mostly because it seemed the most balanced, but that's hard to say after all these transfers; nobody has good stats on anything right now I think.
---
It is the population count too. The more people you have on a server, the more profitable it is for a single group to stay in 1 zone for the entire day. Before, there would only be ~30 players, if that, in a zone at once. The ones that get caught get camped, then they are honorless, and the group moves on. With ~100-200 in a zone like BRM, groups can stay there all day farming new players at the chokepoints and not have to worry about moving zones for fresh honorable targets.
---
Balance is an issue, sure. However, the population count comes into play as well, and for Honor, it makes the honor grind to r14 more competitive, more extreme (more honor gained overall), and more lengthy as the high end of players will push the r13 and r14 honor boundaries so high that everyone else would have to grind more than they used to for a shot at r14.
---
While what you said is true, sprint and vanish are both on pretty hefty cds, without them you can't do much
---
On my server of Kurinaxx we dont have too much trouble.  World chat will call out where horde are and alliance will band together to come clean it up.  Neither faction will hold Thorium Point or Morgans vigil for too long.
---
Like during tuesday 2 alliance guilds (mine and another) teamed up and we wiped a horde guild and the other players outside MC.  Got 50 HKs on the way into MC and we didnt loose a guy. Its all about team work!
---
Or if they even do logs.
---
The bigger problem is server size
---
Whenever you feel stupid, just look at this guy's response to make yourself feel better.
---
Eh, that warrior can fear, intercept stun or grenade you after the overpower to finish you off. Can't dodge if stunned/incapacitated or showing your back running away in fear.
---
because you bought the pattern on neutral ah or someone transferred it that way. The only vendor that has it is in ashenvale and is alliance only
---
While leveling my hunter alt, I got ganked by max level character every 4 minutes on average, including the run back and waiting to res.
---
Took me probably an extra day of playtime to get to 60 because Noone was running dungeons anymore on flamelash either, since getting everyone in BRD took over an hour. Having someone leave cost you another 45 minutes. 
---
I dinged 60 last Saturday, called the other officers in my guild together on sunday, and told them I was moving with or without them. 
---
Players who moved aren't cowardly, they just want to play the game.
---
Do you have serpent sting active, any traps or first aid aggro? Details! aggro log should indicate if there were any relevant changes on the table.
---
I have recently been aggroing a few mobs from a distance larger than normal... Making runs a pain. It's likely my own play, but i catch myself blaming the server :)
---
use the slider to set it to just 60's. 
---
39:61 ally:horde
---
I honestly only PVP for honor, so nobody below 48, and even then, I prefer 60s for higher honor gains.
---
That said, I don't act superior because I think my way of playing a videogame is better than someone else's.  Kinda pathetic when people do that, and you're doing it.
---
Actual co-ordinated premades will crush BGs. And if your faction loses BGs constantly, why not just go do laps of Un'Goro now that no one else is there and grab that free honour?
---
I'm horde on Heartseeker.  Just hit 60.  I'll say it again, cowards.
---
For the record I am not "being a little girl" - I am not even on the server. I  am giving you an objective view of what caused all those Alliance people to leave - nothing more, nothing less.
---
... and yes - I would agree that Alliance probably do the same on Alliance dominated servers but this server in question was Horde dominated hence why I am saying "Horde".  Don't get all spun up.
---
5 corpse runs an hour is still more fun than BFA.
---
What’d you yell ok boomer or go to retail
---
I dig, but it’s not even just rogues. Today at around 2 server time there were about 7-8 camping both boats in wetlands.
---
I mean, assuming you don't want to raid, prot paladin is the perfect "big damn hero" class
---
Other rogue here, dead on the ground. Feelsbadman haha brought shame upon our houses.
---
Ironforge.pro is not accurate for number of players and it never will be.  But it is by far the most accurate source we have for faction balance.
---
You cant. If i remember from vanilla even the Wolf gets us stuck.
---
Getting a good wand early is crucial.
---
Well usually tues/Thursday evenings
---
Yeah I bought my wife the transcendance(priest)one, it was expensive but I got it on sale for half off on JINX. Really wish they would re release those, they are VERY high quality, durable and incredibly thick.
---
Update: Horde side guilds are now following alliance to earthshaker. Seven+Wheelchair+Virdidian+Nigthlife+Unemployed are guilds following but plenty staying.
---
It’s not accurate for the number of players.  But it is highly indicative of what the H:A ratios are on each server.
---
I did and it was great, thank you for the suggestion.
---
Pretty sure Rag wasn't being single phased by trade chat pugs when the honour system dropped either.  Needless to say the nochanges ship has sailed.
---
Lol, I was going to say the same thing. 
---
What keyed me into where the rogue was at the start of the video was the stealth noise.  
---
But it is a staple.  I don't like it any more than anyone else.  But with that same mentality, you shouldn't use any addons.  I think some of the Auction House addons are way more disruptive to this game than anything like Spy.
---
Mages only get free water because they are expected to drink after every pull
---
keep enjoying it dont let haters bring ya down!
---
Yeah that makes sense. Riding/mounts did seem old school to me even for vanilla. So why haven't they gone with 1.12 version like they have for pretty much everything else?
---
&gt; PvP will remain at a high point for a very long time because of the population. People already were going to play more than they used to due to the current player culture of min-maxing, but because everyone competes against one another for ranks, and the best gear is unlocked at r10-14, more people (more great players too) are competing for the same spot.
---
Then the only difference will be time and not the constant griefing. I thought that was the main problem people had. The time it will take for these people to get r14. But the method used will be no different. The best honor/h is still going to be the same griefing gameplay we still have. You are still competing with others and still will have to push your honor to rank. Cuz everyone that is grinding to r10+ is a sweaty nerd.
---
&gt; Having less people, at the bare minimum, decreases the amount of people who are legitimately seeking r14 for the gear. This has a huge effect on PvP in the form of fewer seriously competitive and competent players making ranking harder.
---
But that doesnt matter does it. If it is only 100 sweaty nerds vs 1000 but both of them comprise of 10% of the total population, nothing changed...
---
Maybe yes, some servers will have less and be less toxic but that also already exists. Not every servers is super toxic like the top servers. My server is almost 50/50 and I have never seen any of the horors I have heard from the big servers.
---
All in all, relatively speaking, nothing will change.
---
Again, Alliance do this too. Do you think Horde players are like sociopaths irl or something, lol?
---
&gt; Why are you gatekeeping enjoyment of the game?
---
That's odd my wife has the priest one, I find it to be very well made. Tight stitching, very soft even after a year of washes, very thick and durable. Maybe you got a bad set.
