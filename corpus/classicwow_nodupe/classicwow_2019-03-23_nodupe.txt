My personal Solution: in raids when using master loot the item can only be traded back to the raid leader, who can then give it out to the correct person.

I don't know how that happened. Should be fixed now. I am new to reddit please be gentle.
---
This is Reddit. This is how Reddit works.
---

---
Reddit will turn any community into shit basically.
---
It's very entertaining though.
---
Probably, but you gotta realize people playing the old version in vanilla also wanted the same thing. Its kind of a design flaw.
---
We need to be very thankful and at the same time keep pressuring them to make everything right. Don’t let things slip now
---
I was on the Alliance side the whole time through vanilla and always wished I had friends in real life that wanted to go to the horde side. This time around I’m going to roll Horde and I don’t even have a second thought about it. I can’t wait to see the original game from the side I always wanted to. 
---
Define easy, I would think without consumable or gear you would just run oom on some fights. Would a 58 tank with a green weapon be able to hold threat? If you had a geared tank I could see it more. 
---
you toxic little shit
---
I see **far** more posts vehemently chastising this community than I actually see the community doing things they're being yelled at for.
---
What exactly is wrong with this sub that's so infuriating to you? You wrote a whole paragraph about how shitty the community is without actually providing examples or giving anybody anything to actually stem a discussion off of. To me, *that* is shitty. 
---
&gt; You do realise they only changed this because of the massive outcry, right?
---
You do realise that lots of idiots were stating as locked-in fact worst-case scenarios that Blizzard never said they would do?
---
&gt; Their original plan was Loot Trading in all dungeons and raids.
---
Probably the 4.3ish version where only Greed-rolled loot could be traded, since that was the last implemented retail version of loot trading. It is also totally innocuous and non-exploitable.
---
They already tried letting people trade Need-rolled loot, it led to all the problems people recited endlessly, it was never likely that they would repeat that mistake.
---
My friends and I have been Horde forever but are talking ourselves into going Ally. Keep it fresh!
---
Justifying something and liking something aren't the same thing.
---
Not trolling, but bamboozling
---
There are cases where people have mass right clicked reported people in retail to get them removed from rated bgs, I saw a streamer test it on himself with his guild. It kicked him offline when his whole guild did it. One of the biggest issues with it is that being muted in vanilla is much more of a detriment than retail is.
---
Lol! This team has been an absolute godsend I agree, but my faith in the rest of the company is only going further and further down. I will never forget, "You all have phones don't you?"
---
Actully being among the first ppl to 10 is insane. It means you wont have to compete with anyone when you get to the next zones  and therefore it will save you hours and  maybe even a full day before you hit max level.
---
Hook us up.
---
[here's a spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LA0bZVZEizoe0dVo)  
---
Assuming full PUG dungeon dps (if she goes healer), sometime mid 40s you will start getting some frustrating situations tanking without the prot talents.  Push this out if you have experienced premade folks easily available.  
---
By this I mean, the DPS will need to know how to actually maintain CC and time cooldowns, play to boss mechanics / etc -- as the healer will have enough to keep YOU up, but if they are making mistakes sucking half the heals/cooldowns up.. not gonna work out well.  
---
Early raid content is easier than the latter dungeons.  
---
Keybind every ability, you'll be using everything in the toolkit to keep aggro off cooldown happy people.  
---
Swapping to fury for zerker rage for fear immunity, or for intercept to reclaim aggro (or an extra pack that patrolled into somebody not paying attention)  - super common.  Stance hotkeys should be something very easy.  I used Shift 1-3, that's how important they are.  
---
Do your homework on professions, making gold is not going to be fun at 60 as prot.  Nobody mentioned that plate has the highest repair bills, and you're going to be the first to die when things go really bad.  
---
Don't let any of these points scare you, doing a good job is much more satisfying than the modern tanking methods.    
---
You'll know you're doing a good job when DPS start whispering you about how they usually don't get to use cooldowns for fear of grabbing threat, or thanking you for not being super slow paced at pulling.

Hi Azyr! I think we just missed each other since I transferred to Argent Dawn at the launch of TBC. My character was a human rogue called Avir and I had a bit of a name amongst the PvP crowd. I spent a lot of time with Nathan, Nameless, Dune, Matt and the House Harkain crowd, which may ring bells? 
---
Either way, I’ve had a similar experience to you on RP-PvP and hope Blizzard change their stance and do release one RP-PvP server at least... It seems there is certainly a demand.
---
I hope we meet if they do! Going Horde again? 
---
Yeah but not if you log off before the second guy to hit 10. 
---
No
---
I never got worked up over these little things, so classic team, keep on like you've been doing. You're doing a great job with these changes, without them, all ok with me.
---
So you rather look on a male butt for hundreds of hours instead of female butt?
---
Weve all been conditioned to accept less and less and call it gold.
---
OP, please do not do this. As a lawyer who regularly represents hospitals, physicians, and RNs, you risk serious malpractice giving advice like this.  
---
Zyklon B babies 
---
Not going to provide targets for people to witchhunt, just take a look around this sub
---
Yeah this is a tired excuse as well. Let’s get something straight . I don’t look at my characters ass at all.
---
what addon is used for bottom left when you click/hover on a mob
---
I never said they were . I didn’t even say you are wrong for liking it . I said I personally find it weird is all do you man
---
It's from Dave Chappelle ya dink 
---
There’s a difference between receiving new information, taking the time to internalise it and then forming a new opinion, and being little sheep who’s views flipflop just because someone else changes their opinion. 
---
It seems we have the same dream, my friend :)
---
Call me crazy but I prefer to look at a female butt.
---
It’s not funny. Your 25 likes proved that. 
---
Yep, post their names, blacklist them from your shit and warn people if you see them in LFG chat.
---
You underestimate my pettiness 
---
Did you even read the post? Loot trading is ONLY in raids, which is all master loot anyway.
---
Dungeons don’t have loot trading and that’s what we wanted....
---
? 
---
&gt;if the punishment system is not automated?
---
*responds with automated punishments as the reason*...
---
Literally was halfway through Esfands video then saw this lol
---
Well duuuuh, not if you have a hairy mans ass to look at, lol.
---
You could always just enjoy the game for what it is instead of relishing the nostalgia.
---
What do you think people did before ladders? Just like "Welp, can't fix that shit."
---
What were the rewards? I think I remember seeing 1 free month back in the day. A $15 value. Now days you get like a $300 bonus if u spend more than 1k in a certain time span. O how things have changed. 
---
No in general that’s not even close to where my camera is 90 percent of the time I’m looking at my weak aura CDs and my resources etc etc 
---
Right? after months of silence, this “We took your feedback and made a decision based on that” stuff in the last week or two has been amazing 
---
It will actually strengthen it. You are nostalgic because everything was new and fresh and exciting. Just go into it blind and play horde, yes it won’t be familiar and will take you longer, but that’s the point!
---
My friends and I are doing the same thing. We’ve always been horde but we’re going alliance this time 100% blind. Should be fun!
---
Holy paladins bring that
---
Literally any bonus a Ret pala brings holy paladins bring and instead of dragging people down we actually are the best at our roles. 
---
Nothing worse than seeing Rets take gear from holy paladins reee
---
It was plainly stated that they changed their plan to having BoP loot being tradeable only in raids. Meaning that they originally intended for BoP to be tradeable in dungeons too.
---
Maybe just accept you were wrong with good grace?
---
Says you, there's some of us in here enjoying it. 
---
There won’t be need/greed in guild runs at all, rarely in PuGs. If you’re in a need/greed pug, loot trading is the least of your ninja concerns lol
---
Agreed. Depending on content, the composition of your raid, and your role in your raid, you might be better off swapping +heal with mp5. For instance, if your raid runs with a healthy number of healers and you've got content on farm, you might not need all your +heal gear equipped; mp5 and to a lesser extent, intellect, might serve you best and you blow through content. That's not to say you should be shedding all your +heal for mp5 gear, but if you're sitting at +850 heal and your guild is blowing through MC or BWL, the difference between shedding 100-150 +heal to make room for some pieces that might confer an additional, say, 30 +mp5 could really be worth it. 
---
&gt; Maybe just accept you were wrong with good grace?
---
I'm just saying that some kind of fix was always on the cards, unless you are one of the people who thinks Blizzard is some kind of malignant amoeba incapable of rational thought, that they magically mind-control with reddit downvotes.
---
I think its mobinfo
---
First 10 means a heck of when you’re comparing it between others of your same consistency.
---
I'm joking ofc. I don't care what gender my characters have. Most are male but (tihi) many females. I don't imagine myself being that character or anything like that. Its just a fun game. Its like watching a movie.
---
In Classic I will play a Male Tauren Shaman.
---
Sounds like a good way to lose your medical license before you even get it.
---
Oh for sure, plenty of people in my guild and raid are males that play females . Personally I would rather represent myself as best as possible to others and I find it weird when someone wants to be a diff gender in wow 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Who cares what I think tho 
---
Great content, would love to see one of these for Feralas as well
---
If feedback was unnecessary, they wouldn't have proposed the system in the first place, tbh.
---
Amusing to see all these people downvoting you. Just proves how sheepish people are, and the moment something falls outside their box of thinking they just completely fall apart and everything becomes impossible to them.  
---
You keep doing you man
---
if you have a decent weapon heroic strike does more threat per rage than sunder armor.  Sunder is still worth it for the debuff but don't discount heroic strike.
---
This got to be a troll post to make people toxic lol
---
my man
---
I lost all hope when  I realized your name is just a string of numbers.
---
&gt; Damage != Aggro. Sunder strike gives more aggro, so you go for it on every target, and usually cycle it between a focus target and all others to not lose aoe aggro;
---
this isnt really accurate, in 5mans you'll sunder in most raids the dps can do it since its bad for threat and threat is very important when farming content.
---
also focus targets didnt exist
---
An Undead Warlock offering medical advice?
---
No ty. :V
---
I wonder what the quest would have been like to get the Air Totem. 
---
It doesn’t have a raid lockout but requires a raid group. I can see both sides. In any xpac it would be a raid without question. 
---
It’s clear the intention was (and I believe devs have stated this) to introduce players to the raid environment and it’s more complicated dynamics and demands progressively. 
---
You raise some great points and I understand that you think that the community needs to be more appreciative. but the mindset that it should be “hands fucking off” and “we should be grateful that we are getting servers at all” is not going to achieve anything good for us. “Hands fucking off” didn’t get us classic wow, “hands fucking off” didn’t get us 6 phases of content, “hands fucking off” didn’t get us a better loot trading system. “Hands fucking off” has never gotten any community anywhere. It’s simply surrendering. We need to express our gratitude and let blizzard know we are so happy that they are listening, because it’s very surprising to see. But at the same time we need to keep the pressure up constantly. Keeping the pressure up doesn’t mean whining like a bitch. It means making thoughtful, constructive and respectful posts about ways that we can make classic wow the best it can be. 
---
Yeah that's pretty accurate.
---
Most pugs should use master looter. If your raid lead is a ninja you’re fucked either way, and have to plan around that. All this change means is even fewer puggers will accept any other loot method, and smart players will be sure to get the leader to lay out their loot rules. MS rolling +1 on master looter will probably be the norm.
---
Still more semantics. Physical hit chance is nowhere near as affected as spell hit chance when fighting against higher levels. It's strictly spell hit that works that way because of the way spell hit works, which is described in the link you yourself posted.
---
There's no mention of physical hit calculations in there because physical hits are calculated by a completely different system (weapon skill vs defense skill), and weapon skill is automatically capped when fighting against another player.
---
"when was the last time you went looking for world PvP or attempted to organize it?"
---
Regularly in Ungoro Crater. Often leading to battles with 30+ people. Regularly. 
---
I am sorry that you don't think World PvP is fun unless there is a solid reward of Honor that competes with BGs associated with it.  
---
Level 18 and get carried through blackfathom depths for the gravestone scepter. The real champ of the low level wands. 
---
Sure the enchanting wand is better and available sooner. But come Classic release, this will likely be the first wand many get. 
---
Undead male and female are quite different. While the male usually swings big weapons, it looks that the undead can barely hold it. But when a female uses a two-hander, she does literal flips with it. 
---
I’ve played both PvP and RP realms, never rppvp, and would definitely consider giving it a shot. Nothing wrong with more substance to the game this time around. I know I had no idea what I was getting into when I picked my first server (low pop RP “recommended”, thanks blizz) the way I do now. 
---
same. i am really starting to feel confident :)
---
Eh the movement was one of the biggest faults I found, he was good in not panicking close range, but iirc he intentionally walked up to people to swingclip instead of controlling the battle, I saw those players make huge mistakes that for sure would lose them the fight. It wasn't a bad video I did like it and find it entertaining at parts.
---
I swear there was some kind of roll hack back in the days. I was in oceanic guild and they would always roll 90s
---
Because the phrasing of your question was too broad that it would require extra questioning for what is basically a quick google search, and these types of threads are made often.
---
Physical abilities versus spells. They aren't calculated using the same formula. Spells are practically impossible to land against higher level targets. Physical abilities are different, and are much more likely to land. I'm not too sure about blind however.
---
OP has no clue what they're talking about and they're mixing up spell and physical hit formulas.
---
First off that 3 days you are talking about is known to be incorrect because they compared quest exp number to Joanna's videos and they were way off. Not just that private servers do a lot of guess work for data (Not saying it isn't possible to be faster than Joanna). Second the faster IRL days you are trying to cap the slower it is going to be because you will have less rested Exp. Also remember these "records" are recorded when there isn't a bunch of others trying to perform the same thing which can easily add even more time. 1 person needs the rep but you need a group to farm the rep (unless they are doing the limited mobs in Silithus) and the person will need to be 60 to be able to get the quest. 
---
We're horde, and international 
---
an entirely different team (shown at blizzcon) was hired specifically for classic
---
It’s actually funny to look at meters and make fun of everyone who is being outperformed by the meme spec.  It creates an atmosphere where everyone is trying harder.
---
Man I couldn’t agree more with you. For some reason people think that disagreeing with a decision by blizzard means you are some angsty, ungrateful dickhead. These “ungrateful” people are the reason that classic is even happening. There will always be bad eggs in a community, but on the whole I’m happy with this community because it has led to blizzard backtracking (super rare very blizzard) on core elements. If this community only consisted of the people telling others to not complain, we would have a half-assed classic - actually we probably wouldn’t have classic at all. We need to keep the pressure up! And we need to let blizzard know we are loving their interaction with us. But don’t be toxic and immature, keep it constructive. Put effort into your feedback if you expect blizzard to put the effort into listening!
---
Its exhausting both ways.  I've largely stepped away from the forums and discussion because I'm just going to play the game the way I want and let other play the way they want.  I'll find a group that caters to my playstyle and it will be fun.
---
I'd like to see Azshara Crater 
---
Lol I was expecting the flower to say “if you want to be a minmaxer then fuck you”
---
Lots of people do it.  It feels weird for me though, so I don’t.  Ultimately, you do you. 
---
Oh, keep in mind that if it does feel weird to you, then you may end up not liking/playing that character.  Hate to have a big time investment go to waste cause you don’t love your character.  
---
Or a gnome if you are in fact not 2 feet tall.
---
Yeah replace hardcore with minmaxer and you get a more accurate meme. This post itself is a perfect example. 
---
Wow I used to listen to that podcast 10 years ago. Always wonder what Randy was up to. I'm sure Scott still runs it well though. 
---
&gt;What did you guys expected ?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;What you asked for is what you got.
---
This is not really a fair characterization. A loud aggro minority of people whined and bitched for the things you mentioned, and a seasoned company like Blizzard should have known how to either ignore them or accomodate them with less shit changes. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For example, revamping dungeons to be a 15 minute zergblast was Blizzard taking community feedback (legacy dungeons are too long and hard and not worthwhile) and going way too far. They are still responsible for the extent to which they tuned dungeons to basically be 1 mannable by a heirloom tank. 
---
Yes there was loud complaining, but the extent to which Blizzard catered to it is their own fault. You can't pin that on the players - the players are not game designers, they are not engineers, they are not producers, they are just...voices. 
---
Also, much of the changes (like ability pruning classes to only have functionality within their spec, not their class) were heavily contested and hated amongst players, but Blizzard did them anyway. 
---
I get what you're saying, I'm just a little salty about how much people on this sub bitch and complain about retail players. 
---
Yes, I'm sure many of them bitched and moaned for stuff that they now hate, but ultimately, the buck does stop with the developer. 
---
&gt; Yea maybe you won't be able to kill a lvl 60 when you are lvl 40 no matter how hard you try 
---
[O rly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pyz2UPkvCo)
---
Jokes aside, it's only casters that have the issue OP is describing, yet OP is misconstruing the truth and saying that everyone is going to be unable to land hits on a higher level.
---
The truth is that it's only spells that have "unfair" formulas for lower levels. Classes like rogues/hunters have no issue taking on higher levels because of the way hit chance is calculated for physical damage.
---
I hope this is a troll.. not only would this be weird but could put you in some hot water legally. Just the thought of seeing someone advertising medical advice for gold in trade cringes me out lol
---
lmao then u haven't seen the people working on retail WoW. They think they know what's good for the game.
---
If you’re the type of person racing to 10 or 20 at server launch, you’re not stopping there.  
---
“Doesn’t mean anything if you sleep 8 hours after”. There’s no way that person won’t be pushing the rest of the way there.
---
Versatility... ugh
---
It seems that way but basically back when realm transfers were released, it was not possible for PvP players to transfer to PvE realms. When players asked why that is, Blizzard illustrated that it's not fair for PvE players, who have leveled in calm/easy environments to transfer to servers where leveling can be much, much more brutal due to non-stop ganking and pvp (ie: STVietnam). Due to that, Blizzard forbid any transfers from PvE realms to PvP realms. Thus server merges follow in suit.
---
I like this rule but I can imagine, over a long enough time, it would inevitably cause drama 
---
I think you’re missing the point.
---
easier to mouse-click everything. I honestly cannot believe that as a hunter in vanilla, I mouseclicked and keyboard turned all the way through BWL. shudder
---
I don't recall seeing people asking for class changes when classes were actually fun, I don't recall people asking for island expeditions, I don't recall people asking for warfronts, I don't recall people asking for world quests, I don't recall people asking for azurite neck.
---
Very good point, I'd forgotten that.
---
Sharding kills classic wow. There is no chance in hell they'd ever implement that 
---
How about yours flip that badboy over and show us the back...for artistic reasons of course.
---
&gt;then why does everyone feel the need to justify it? (Attack animations etc etc
---
you literally said exactly that, but ok. you do you too. cheers
---
Lol, people who are complaining about OP, you are all missing the point.
---
They either try and do a million different things for a million different people and don't develop any of them. Or they do one thing that a lot of people hate and never change course.
---
I suggest trying horde out on a private server. Then you'll know what you wanna go for actual classic. I played a few 'rounds' on horde. It help affirm my choice of alliance. (Which was my OG faction too).
---
Direction with a core philosophy to stick by, vs half a decade of "what now".
---
Haven't gotten the sharding post yet.
---
Exactly. I don't understand why people feel the need to report. Literally doing ignore accomplishes the same thing except tickle your pickle when it comes to "justice" or whatever. Honestly people are too fanatical about punishing people who do things wrong instead of just saying whatever typing ignore and moving on
---
Sharding kills classic wow without a doubt. There's no chance in hell they would risk doing that 
---
Guy. It's the internet. Where ppl that play games are being an alias Nd keyboard. Lol what do you expect? Waiting for information months at a time. Common, you need to relax. Communities change outside this sub, in the game will be much different.
---
It's because Classic is under the radar. They don't have investors breathing down their neck about it.
---
Which is exactly why I asked the question I asked, the way I asked it.  The person I was responding to (/u/RemeZZ which is not the person who responded to me /u/IsItReallyEmpty ) said they'd be fine with the middle of the line solution where the punishment isn't automated....but they'd still prefer it didn't exist.  This confuses me because it just doesn't make sense from any perspective other than #NOCHANGESMOTHERFUCKER which is an invalid perspective simply because we know it's already not a stance Blizz is taking.
---
Ive been alliance since TBC. Have leveled both sides but im thinking this time around Horde is the way to go. 
---
No..? Where have you been the majority have quit.
---
Right...which is exactly why I don't want automated punishments and why I'm confused over the stance that the person I responded to wouldn't MIND a middle-line solution, but would still prefer it isn't there at all.  The middle-line solution is literally the same solution that was in vanilla already but faster and less annoying to get to.
---
Yeah that clown suit from mixed cloth, letter, and plate looks downright intimidating 
---
I could be wrong but I thought this was only in BGs. 
---
I was dealing with this recently, using a new 2h weapon in BGs vs wPvP without max skill, and it seemed to hold true.
---
I thought it was to stop people levelling a rogue to 60 in safety on a PvE server then transferring to a PvP server and ganking. If you wanted a sixty on a PvP server you had to earn it on a PvP server.
---
But either way it is the same, right? Putting PvE players onto a PvP server is very bad, and is never going to happen. Putting PvP players onto a PvE server is still bad but the lesser evil.
---
Game isnt even out yet and people prise jesus.
---
They wouldn’t be in STV before 30 so it’s likely they misremembered their level, more than anything else
---
I think they could release it without battle groups, then throw low pop servers or servers with severe imbalances into battle groups with each other to help the queue times.  Having 4-5 servers on a battlegroup doesn't mean you won't get familiar with your opponents.  It just means you can't gank that guy at black rock mountain later that day when he's trying to get into BWL.
---
Honestly I just don’t want to lose the ironforge-thorium point flight path. It’s so handy.
---
This sub is 70% people asking what class to play, 20% people asking what happens after naxx, and the rest is discussion on decisions blizz is making and possible changes. 
---
The only toxicity I see is in response to threads suggesting quality of life changes.. which of course there will be toxicity towards. Changes like that are what made the game what it is today. Do you expect everyone to be accepting of suggestions that would potentially ruin their favourite game? Like seriously, what do you expect?
---
From where I’m sitting all of the stink the people from this sub are making has resulted in several great changes for the game, so until you can give us some actual examples of this rampant toxicity that you’re whining about you can go home.
---
Anyone think that his mouse looks a lot like an autoclicker?
---
I was thinking about doing this but i was too lazy. Thanks for the break down!
---
Even with PVE being the most popular (which i expect again tbh). The best outcome is still having one of each at launch and letting it devlop from there. If there were 6 its pretty clear they could support one overall per region.
---
I think it would be folly to release it later because of "Demand" though. Once that opening window comes and goes with the clear limited number there were it would just make the situation that much worse
---
Pretty close to Varraks attempt though he grids 1 entire level. Will be hard to do on fresh though
---
My twink 60 rogue's name was Soap... thought I was so oiginal
---
Funnily enough rogues could sap level 60's with a good amount of accuracy, letting them escape.
---
Glad I'm not the only one!
---
No it isn’t? Are you sure about that?
---
StaySafe likes to encourage his viewers to brigade his posts.
---
In the way I described it? I highly disagree. 
---
yes, weapon skill doesn't matter in pvp.
---
Shit man i would not want you as a doctor wtf
---
Rogues got shafted pretty hard on all but tier 3 if I remember correctly.  Their gear had str on it which took up as many points on the armor as +attack power but only provided half the attack power.
---
I've played since vanilla and fairly often on private servers and this change doesn't seem to have mattered at all for melee classes. Me and my brother killed level 60's on the regular at level 40 ish
---
&gt; The people in this sub are some of the most toxic I've ever seen
---
You must have never been to official WoW forums then, or any online community for that matter.
---
Welcome to the internet
---
&gt; See, this is what I mean
---
When you don't quote what they say, you end up with responding to [removed].
---
Most of us want to see the "toxic" things you're referring to, but if we don't get to it before about 15 minutes have past, we don't see it the way you did.
---
I just ignore them and move on.  It's the internet.  Plenty of crap all around, watch your step.
---
I have no real experience of it to be honest, it’s just the evidence from the videos. I think the take away here is that you can bring decent damage and the utility of a paladin. Like everything, you get out what you put in. I guess you just have to put for effort into ret? Not every guild will be so elitist to deny a ret that will put the effort in.
---
The name might be a bit too tricky for the avarage mind here
---
We will get the noobs back every time there is a slack in content in retail.
---
That alone will keep low levels relevant for a long time to come.
---
blind misses maybe 1% of the time no matter what the level, it's like intimidating shout
---
Gotta roll Hunter to legally ninja now.
---
Exactly - my guild was home to a boomkin and we still got through bwl! 
---
&gt;Also the quality of life for a mage is about 100000000% higher. They are better overall in pvp for the entire expansion. They are also T1 at everything. T1 raider, T1 pvp, T1 leveler, T1 farmer. Mages are the silk slipper wearing spoiled kids in classic. Warlocks are their jealous younger brother who sold their soul just to keep up lol.
---
I would agree with overall Mage being a higher QOL class, but I think you are selling locks short here. 
---
Locks are faster levelers for most people, as you can go-go-go like a hunter due to your pet + dots on the move + life tap. Generally locks are considered to be the faster leveler, as most players aren't going to be optimally AOE farming. 
---
Locks are very strong in PVP as well, and a subject of massive bitching too. Don't know if I'd straight up say Mage &gt; Lock for PVP. 
---
Mage DPS in raids I believe across the tiers is higher in general, I will concede that, but Lock raid utility is high, and Lock DPS is no slouch either - outside of the golden vanilla classes (Warrior, Rogue, Mage) who are basically the kings of raw DPS, Locks are next up. In terms of getting raid invites and competition for r-dps invites, I'd say a Lock will give you better odds, since you're going to see 2-3x as many Mages. 
---
In terms of flexibility to use unique talent specs and experiment, I'd say Locks also have more leeway, especially in early raiding. 
---
Both awesome classes though - in many ways, I will argue that Mage is perhaps the finest WoW class from a game design perspective. But I think it's selling Locks short to say that Mages are better in every category. 
---
I'm in one- PM me if you're interested. My members are 30+ with kids. 
---
I was thinking about doing this too. It’s funny, I remember some random lyrics of songs but I have to spend 15 minutes trying to find each and every one.
---
For example...”We are waaaariors....born from the light!”
---
Song: warriors
---
By: freedom call
---
Random pvp songs like these I remember from random videos and it gives me goosebumps! This was from a horrible pally video back in the day haha
---
May be an unpopular opinion but I like levelling horde more than alliance in Vanilla. Have tried both sides a lot of times.

Thanks for writing.  As a vanilla RP-PVP player, I am pretty bummed that it appears we won't get it at launch (and I won't be playing until we do).  It's great to see that at least someone still wants to try to experience.  Hope to see you on our one server one day.
---
Or you could just play the fucking game?
---
SOil - Breaking Me Down was pretty popular for PVP. I think it wasn't on the original video, but one of the videos of High Warlord Pat had it playing
---
RemindMe! 3 months

This appears to be a private server, and unfortunately, we generally don't allow pure gameplay videos from private servers. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but please try r/wowservers for your video.
---
Good lawd, have some spine! Playing a class just because you will be more "desired" for groups is horrible advice for a time consuming MMO like Vanilla WoW. You need to thoroughly enjoy your class and especially the road to 60. You will find a group regardless of what class you are if you show enough initiative and are a fun person to be around. The only exception to this is raids, which it sounds like you won't have the time to do.
---
Gotta get your screamo, rise against, fall out boy, maybe old Kanye... But definitely Disturbed
---
I am kinda worried that classic will wind up looking like "World of Warriors, Rogues, Mages, and Priests". They really do feel like "first-class" classes, and if you are a "I want to top the meters / be hardcore / raid Naxx" then you basically are going to play these classes. 
---
Every other class (Druid, Sham, Pally, Lock, Hunter) is basically a "fuck it, we need 2 of them, maybe 3, because they have a cool utility spell."
---
And while I believe in playing what you want, I think a lot of players are just going to play what's strong, because no one wants to feel like they are taken along for Tranq shot or for Windfury totem. 
---
How about every song from the unbreakable sulfuras warlord shaman pvp video? 🤣

I'm pretty certain most of the legion client leftovers that would tkae too much effort to remove like this will be in classic already, e.g. right click ignore, larger inspect range.
---
Ridiculously impressive time, thanks for sharing!
---
Dals swords definitely will see some pug ML abuse. This has been happening since vanilla, though, and is part of the game. Expansions changed this later in WoW’s lifecycle...so I’m at a loss as to why this would be even considered.
---
It’s just gaming culture these days, if there isn’t something to be angry about they invent something to be angry about. 
---
The film example just before this was puzzling too. People love old movies. And for good reason.
---
You can find old movie showings anywhere there’s some kind of art venue. There are college courses and TV channels and endless home viewing options and releases. All dedicated to old films. I’ve watched films from the 1890s and every decade onward on a big cinema screen, and it was a worthwhile venture. Old games shouldn’t be any different.
---
Yeah, social will play a bigger deal this time around than it did the first time for sure.
---
&gt; when the top Fortnite streamers, Apex streamers, variety streamers, etc all start gravitating towards Classic WoW for a few months
---
I think all those guys will try it, but whether or not they stick around for a few months or not is totally up in the air.  Statistically, 70% of them won't =p
---
I mean listen, he was a dedicated boomkin, and we were cool with that,  but he ended up switching to a lock.
---
&gt; I can see the headlines now! Epic molten core raid cut tragically short as 40 people have sudden heart attacks brought on by exhaustion!
---
Blizzard gives those who died at their computers 30 day suspensions in an ongoing investigation.
---
It was implemented because everyone SWORE up and down the algorithm for rolling in WoW was geared to give you lower rolls. &lt;So I made it so lowest rolls won, but then people whined even more because they began rolling high&gt;
---
But this rule? Everyone loved it. They thought it was SO much fun. Someone may roll a 98! But oh baby, seeing that 1 come across the screen, it was like you were watching a game-winning touchdown every time. Discord went WILD!
---
really highlights the flaw of expansion-based development. Ion and the team spend 2 years in secret developing features for an expansion that we are comnpletely blind to, meanwhile when you have a game like Classic we are in full understanding of the impact of these changes and can make suggestions. By the time an expansion is out, suggestions to change shit features just cut too much into dev time.
---
&gt; I thought it was to stop people levelling a rogue to 60 in safety on a PvE server then transferring to a PvP server and ganking. If you wanted a sixty on a PvP server you had to earn it on a PvP server.
---
Right right, this is exactly what I said. According to Blizzard it's simply not fair for someone to level on an easier environment and then transfer to a harder one without putting in the work. I'm not sure specifically ganking lower levels had something to do with it.
---
&gt; But either way it is the same, right? Putting PvE players onto a PvP server is very bad, and is never going to happen. Putting PvP players onto a PvE server is still bad but the lesser evil.
---
True. Putting PvE players onto a PvP is straight unfair (according to Blizzard), but putting PvP players onto a PvE server is just unfortunate. It wouldn't be necessarily unfair but it would be disappointing. 
---
Sorry ,  I guess I just don’t understand what you mean here. You can like something sure but if it were normal then why feel the need to justify it . That’s what I meant 
---
I never said likening something and justifying something are the same? 
---
Also I see a lot of people say cheers I feel like I wanna work that into my vocabulary more 
---
Video is impossible in 1.12, I think it’s even before diminishing returns 
---
Always wanted to be horde but all my friends were alliance. Always wanted to play shaman but all my friends were alliance. Tried making a Draenei shaman in TBC but at that point I didn’t feel like relearning a class. Leveled a shaman to max, still, but raided as my hunter. During lich king I made a Druid for a classic guild, alliance again, hoping to get close to that shaman feeling. Was fun. But still, not quite what I wanted. 
---
Going orc shaman this time, nothing is stopping me. 
---
I'm literally crying rn
---
Fresh recruits that do need gear should get the gear. The worst systems are those that require people to prove themselves or save up dkp or some such bullshit. 
---
Loot council with a fair council focused on improving the guild are the best ones.
---
It's like a company, you have to invest money in getting even new hires new equipment for them to be able to work and feel valuable. Sure, sometimes you strike out and find someone that just takes the gear and leave. But most people don't.
---
It only applies to raids, I think he would have mentioned a toggle if that’s how it’s to work.
---
Also, the worse your personality is the more you should play a desired role. This person, for example, should play a tank or healer if they want to have a good time. 
---
If you can't make people like you make them need you. 
---
I did comprehend what I read. I was proposing another solution and asking if it was viable. :)
---
[removed]
---
u/iScReAm612 is clearly very high up in the company and can pull some strings to have this card released again!
---
I am on team mildchanges because the thing to understand is that 1.12 is basically still a BETA. There was more changes planned. You can read interviews with devs - they wanted to fix paladins, fix shamans, make a more fluid druid cat rotation, fix moonkin. They held off on a lot of these things because they didn't have time before the BC release, and they figured it wouldn't make sense to have to retune these changes again. 
---
Basically, 1.12 WoW was never the pinnacle of what I believe vanilla WoW could have been. 
---
I wish we could start out with no changes, but then actually use player data and common sense to fix some of the broken ass specs. I would be happy to keep the "undertuned" slightly so as not to disrupt classic experience for warriors, rogues, mages etc who enjoy topping meters. Just implement some common sense changes to make these "meme specs" functional. 
---
We didn't need it back then and we don't need it now 
---
Wtf, as a warlock player please no
---
Farming shards / bag management is part of the class. I may not *enjoy* running out of soulshards at the moment, but on the grand scheme of things it makes the entire experience better and more warlocky. I have more things to do, I need to go out and capture souls and stuff them in crystals. But I can’t just go on a spree and do 1000 of them and never worry about it again, because bagspace
---
They are all in denial. But hey, let’s just bitch &amp; complain on the forums when they get their tier gear stolen away in front of their little tiny eyes when a person uses this method. Good idea people. Incredible.
---
It’s a character. It doesn’t need to be *you*
---
Warrior really isn’t that gear dependant. A lot of their strength in pvp is charge/intercept, hamstring and mortal strike. It is nice to have good gear but a warrior in some decent blues is very powerful in bgs, other classes like ele shamy and warlock will struggle to get anything done at that gear level.  
---
In pve yes you do need to get some items with the right stats but they will be right there at the top of the meters from 5 mans and mc all the way through to naxx. Warlocks on the other hand with 16% miss are just just painful in blue/mc gear.  
---
And yes rogue can kill people with double cb evis for a highlight reel, but for the other 9 mins they will be complete garbage without gear. For consistent fighting in bgs they rely heavily on damage to kill people in their stuns. This idea that they don’t need gear because of meme pvp videos in early patches is stupid.
---
all i have to say to this https://imgur.com/a/VOVOrg3
---
Never underestimate the power of FOMO, I doubt the player falloff rates will be that high this time around.
---
The issue lies in that they could use it later too.
---
If they use it for the starting zones because of too many people, what might happen during aq then? Or when most are 60 and is just outside durotar or ironforge dueling? These areas are  presumably two of the zones that would have sharding too...
---
For me, it's a matter of not trusting blizzard completely, although they're getting there with all the feedback we're getting recently. But they did say that sharding on retail also would only ever be used during extremely crowded scenarios, which changed completely.
---
Exactly -- the goal IMO should be to start with 1.12 as a relatively stable base, and then make game design decisions consistent with classic's game design. IE, part of classic game design was that hybrid classes should not be as strong on their damage spec as raw DPS classes. 
---
This is fair, and should be respected. Moonkin and Ret and Shammy DPS should be kept lower than true DPS classes's optimal DPS spec. But, these classes should still have their mana performance looked at and their raw numbers looked at so they actually WORK as a DPS spec. 
---
I think this is what classic MEANT to do - and if we stuck on vanilla for another year, I'm sure Blizz would have fixed, say, Moonkin to be able to not go OOM as quick. They'd still underperform compared to a mage, but they'd be able to perform without chain-chugging pots. 
---
For what that's worth on a pally.
---
I think classic wow has just a few too many competing youtubers and their tryhard methods are grating. I mean, everyone knows every content creator is going to address this news, and we know what to expect out of each of them, It’s just instant description and reaction, not insightful analysis. 
---
I wasn’t so critical of this situation until this sub made me aware of it. But now I can’t under it.
---
And my axe.
---
I've always chosen females in the games I've played. If Im given the choice, I'll always take female over male. I've always thought badass to do heroic shit with all-too-often sensitive-looking chicks.
---
Plus, if you get bored, there's always something eye-candy to look at. 
---
Voices are also less annoying in the long run than males' and walking animations are often more to my liking.
---
I think it's also part of the fantasy right? Do something that you'll never be able to do it real life. If I'm gonna save the world, might as well do it with boobies I know I'll never have. 
---
Don't carry another set of gear. It's a huge pain, and it doesn't make a huge difference. You'll be fine as long as the rest of your group is paying well. If you aren't able to heal an instance, then just get a few more levels and try again. 
---
Recently rediscovered Rob Zombie along with all the nostalgia attached to that and wow. So:
---
Dragula - Rob Zombie,
---
Living Dead Girl - Rob Zombie
---
What about all those times I wrecked people as a Warrior in 2vs2 with a Shaman healer who laid Windfury totem down?
---
This is always framed as a debate but I don’t think that’s the right way to look at it. If you’re on a PvP server, some people are going to do that. You can’t stop them with words. You can’t talk to them, let alone shame them. You can plan around ganks, or fight back, but the community will never stop them by moral consensus or whatever.
---
This is strange to me, because I enjoy the classic AV turtles, but also don't want every AV to be a 2+ hour HK farm.  
---
Complaining about 1.12 AV not being the same and the fights not being as epic is just wrong in my experience.  The turtles were never started because of the npcs, they were started by players that wanted to turtle, or just got rezzed at a bad GY and didn't wanna make the trek north/south.
---
Back to the point, AV is played by the community, not by the mechanics of pre-1.12 AV.. If the 40 people in your AV want to rush the boss for quick honor/rep, then it's going to happen because the majority want it.  If the majority of them wanna turtle, it's gonna be a turtle.  Hell, turtles happened even in TBC, they just ended sooner because of reinforcements running out.
---
Hello. I am a semi-experienced tank in classic (I tanked up to BWL before my guild fell apart). If you wish to tank in Classic WoW please follow my little guide.
---
First of all, marking mobs in dungeon is an absolute priority. This means that you will tank -- build aggro upon -- mobs in this order. So for example, skull, cross, star. You might also want to mark mobs for crowd control -- "CC" -- for example, moon for polymorph, square for freeze trap, diamond for fear (these are the commonly accepted target marks... when fearing make sure you communicate to the warlock that you will be pulling back before they can fear, as it will pull adds if the feared mob runs into more mobs).
---
Upon the pull, you will want to immediately place a sunder on the skull, followed by the cross or star, with a revenge placed upon the cross or skull and a sunder on the star (this is entirely up to you). Your biggest threat generators are: shield slam, revenge, and sunder, in that order. You should only use heroic strike when you are rage capped, which usually means a raid environment. Threat efficiency is: revenge (5 rage), sunder (20 rage -- 15 with talents), shield slam (20 rage). UPON PULLING YOU IMMEDIATELY USE BLOODRAGE. GENERATING RAGE GENERATES THREAT.
---
Your primary melee threat generators are sunder armor, revenge, and shield slam. Before 40 you will be mostly using sunder and revenge so please prioritize those abilities. Also of note: battle shout can generate snap aggro on the immediate pull, which should help a little on establishing immediate threat. But you should really be getting out the sunders and revenges after pulling with your ranged weapon. Heroic Strike also generates a high amount of threat but should not be used at the expense of all others.
---
Also: ALWAYS BE THE FIRST TO PULL. Pulling in classic makes sure you (almost) 100% will stay on the top of the threat meter. How pulls work in classic is, the person who pulls, will gain a small bonus to their threat during the course of the encounter. So if any DPS pull for you -- IMMEDIATELY SLAM THEM IN CHAT AND STATE THAT IF THEY DO SO AGAIN THEY ARE LIABLE TO BE KICKED. Being a tank is part leadership, part authority -- I know this sounds big-dick-ish but if you let a DPS walk all over you once, twice, thrice, they will never learn their lesson so do follow through on your kick threats if they will not listen. Tank pulling is 100% a prio and if any DPS argue -- kick them. Just kick them if they argue with you or do not change their habits. 
---
Anything else please ask me
---
You said that **everyone** feels the need to justify it when in fact they may just like it. ie - I like these animations, so I'm going to go with that. There is no justification coming into that. People aren't saying "I want to be a female char, but I need to come up with an excuse to be able to pick it." Some might be but not everyone like you say. Why is this so hard?
---
So, you're the annoying person who floods the auction with stacks of 5!
---
I disagree, because Blizzard is literally ONLY doing classic to satisfy this core group of people. It's not like retail where Blizzard is trying to design a new experience -- Blizzard is trying to implement something that has already been designed, and they are doing it for the community. 
---
(And by community, I mean people who are both active and inactive subs - they are trying to build classic primarily for ex-WoWers). 
---
This means, it kind of does matter how player sentiment is. Blizzard needs to continue to understand the mentality of the people asking for classic, because who do you think is going to pay 15 a month to play classic? THESE GUYS AND GALS. 
---
Mr "hurr durr I think we should just kinda do whatever, 1.12 AV, 1.8, who really gives a shit" may be more in line with my thinking. That is how I see it. But honestly, I'm not the one classic is being made more. I'm going to be a tourist most likely. 
---
Blizzard is not making classic to butter my bread. They are making classic to butter the  bread of the guy who is going to throw a tantrum when he doesn't see kazzak in Snowfall. It does matter. 
---
I don't agree with the whining, but I am glad Blizzard is communicating. And I think people have the right to opine. Blizzard knows the deal - vanilla is something that exists in the hearts and minds of the players. What is vanilla? It is an experience, sustained by players memory, and if you want to give those players an experience that will retain them... then yeah, it's worth hearing their bitching and moaning. 
---
Subs reached 10 mil IN WotLK not before it...
---
I still have no faith whatsoever in the retail WoW team. They've had too many chances and made the wrong decisions time and time again.
---
Classic team is doing a great job so far.
---
I am damn close to making a PSA thread telling people to stop asking about healing as x spec while leveling, you can LITERALLY heal dungeons as a druid/priest/pally/shaman in green int gear from 15-20 levels below you if your group is mildly average. They are meant to be fun and entertaining, not NAXX. Just go look at the healing tree and see most of the talents just increase your abilities by a marginal amount. Knowing that leveling dungeons have to have huge tolerance ranges to accommodate bad players, it only takes a little bit of experience and knowledge to stomp those dungeons.

saying you okay a female character because you like the animations is in fact a justification my man 
---
I have so much superstition about wow rolls lmao. I’m CONVINCED that rolling first after an item link in raid warning always fucks you over.
---
It's become a meme for a reason: good expansion (MoP) -&gt; bad expansion (WoD) -&gt; good expansion (Legion [in the 2nd half, anyways]) -&gt; bad expansion (BfA). They're incapable of staying the course when they find something that works. Every expansion is a clean slate, and half the time they fuck it up horribly.
---
&gt;There is no faster way to be feel disappointed than to read the forums.
---
This was the day I quit Shammy in vanilla. 
---
Now, to be fair, the complaining was somewhat valid because the enh and ele specs were basically a disgrace, and I think it's natural to be mad that you spend 3 months leveling a toon to be trash / purely utility in raids. 
---
But just understanding that my class was totally uncompetitive and shit, and better players than me with better gear were putting out shit numbers, and hearing that validated by some of the best shamans who did have a name brand for themselves... was definitely discouraging.
---
I agree. They remind me of the core Blizz team back in the days, doing it out of passion and love for WoW.
---
I can't wait to have them with us throughout classic, it's gonna be a great experience for everyone.
---
So far, Blizzard is only sharding for leveling reasons, since hundreds of people fighting for few dozen mobs or one of two quest objectives is not fun. 
---
I played horde for 15 years.
---
Am playing Alli on a pserver due to new guild. It feels kind of weird.
---
I see Tauren and Undead and think they’re my friends. Then they kill me. :(
---
Whatever metric you use to describe arcane as "pretty viable" is double or 3 times as true of the other specs. Arcane missiles is not as bursty as fireball or efficient as frostbolt, the pushback does not truly matter. If you want to play arcane you can grab clearcasting and do some cleave pulls of 3 mobs with rank 1 AE and nova, and using clearcasting for Cone of Cold/Arcane Explosions. As you get better you can do huge aoe pulls without blizzard. After clearcasting arcane offers less than the other trees, maybe meditation then go frost and choose to specialize in aoe or single target talents.
---
Yikes
---
Isn't it Activision? 
---
Agree, feel my faith in at least some part of blizz being restored. They are currently at 2 strikes for me (Diablo Immortal and HGC cancellation), so let's hope we don't see a strike 3!
---
The pros are self explanatory and significant.
---
More cons though; really, pet management. They go through so much more food than you’d expect. 
---
It’s the easiest dps class, maybe easiest class fullstop, to make a big oopsie and wipe the raid.
---
Huh? I thought it was the hardcore players telling casual players what race/class/spec combinations that they can and can't play? 
---
Do you recall if aoe had a chance to proc PER target or PER cast? I realize individual tics of blizz did not work in vanilla.
---
Enjoy the stick up your ass 
---
Yes this is just reformatted. All the info is identical and in the same order. Oddly enough Kargoz is credited at the end along with the people Kargoz already had in the credits 
---
Mine too.  It feels like OSRS all over again.  Quality devs listening to the community and getting ready to put out a kick ass product.  Looking forward to it.  Summer cant come too soon.
---
If you want to rp on a pvp server just select pvp server and RP all day. Why does it need to say RP?
---
Yea, that is what they are saying they will do. 
---
But they had a similar reason for sharding in retail, and that ended up being a lie.
---
Blizzard has a shitty record when it comes to using sharding.
---
&gt;But all the classic wow youtubers I’ve seen are pretty low quality
---
MadSeasonShow? Frostadamus? Kargoz?

Players always ask for shit. They aren't wrong to do so, it's blizzard's responsibility to know better. Players aren't game designers, producers, QA, engineers, artists, etc etc -- they are just random people who, at best, have some experience playing a few similar games and can offer decent feedback. 
---
Blizzard's game design is based on the idea of incentives and teaching players skills and techniques, and sort of revealing layers to the player that he or she did not know they had. Basically, it is borne out of a "we do in fact know better than you about how to entertain you" -- this is the hallmark of vanilla. 
---
They lost that and started pandering to try to make people happy, and they alone are to blame for that. They know that players will always want free gold, free purples, free mounts, everything under the sun, etc. These people aren't to blame, because they would always exist in any game. How could players know that making leveling and legacy dungeons easy would ruin their fun? Blizzard is supposed to know that; the devs and designers must know their players and know human psychology. 
---
I love madseasonshow but I’m pretty sure he makes it a point to say he’s not a classic YouTuber he still played retail as well. As for the other 2 I’ve not looked into them much 
---
No, you are right in that sense. It all really depends on what the server pop is. I think people are sitting here thinking it’s going to be 12k, which I doubt. The game breaks past 8k. 
---
My comment was more so that there are tons of ways to level at the start, and doing every quest is poor, whether it’s a fresh server with high pop, or same as a fresh server in the days of vanilla. There are quests like the one mentioned, or dream catcher/relics in teldrassil that should just be skipped, because the xp gained is nothing compared to the time spent.
---
I think scaling has gotten a bit goofy.  The damage/gear scaling has prevented players of different gear levels playing together as well.  
---
In vanilla-wotlk, the dps triples at most from when you start gearing at max level, to the final tier.  When I played MoP/Wod, the damage increased 20x over the expansion and you really couldn't play with new players the same way.  
---
Might be a silly argument, but it has always bothered me.
---
What does it mean
---
Should race choices be made on allied race duel matchups?
---
the hardcore players are telling you whats best. they are not forcing you to play it because they realy dont care what ppl that are not in their guilds do
---
ya
---
Fair enough, but yeah I recommend them if you like MadSeason!
---
I wouldn’t mind if they just kept level cap and kept adding raids and 5 mans after naxx
---
these people don't want world pvp, they want people to pointlessly gather in hillsbrad and zerg each other back and forth as if it's some ghetto battleground 
---
That's for modern WoW. This is Vanilla WoW, where Blizzard keeps making changes to make it more Vanilla-like. I wouldn't worry about it too much. 
---
They *were* good. A lot of the additional heroes they've released have done major harm to the game's meta (Brigitte, Sombra, Doomfist especially).
---
Overwatch went from a really fun, casual hero shooter to a frustrating CC-fest really quickly.
---
Actually they do care, the one time a “hardcore” guy has to pug a dungeon or raid he usually complains about everyone in his group and tells everyone how bad they are at the game....usually ending the comment with “I’m a hardcore raider” or “I’m a mythic raider in retail” just to feel accomplished.
---
I hope so.  40-49 was the shit. 
---
Nah, I've always liked being able to easily report racists etc.
---
Recently one of the fired gm's/cms have said that its an exaggerated problem where abusers are punished, but even so I'd be happy if they made it so every false report is a 3+ day ban, and take away the report feature from people who abuse it a set number of times. Ez.
---
I do think some of you exaggerate when you genuinely believe that this feature will "wreck havoc in this game." Like seriously, "You won't be able to find groups and you won't be able to buy or sell profession goods/services." lmao
---
It's been 10,000 years but I swear it was random pathing in vanilla. But even if I am remembering correctly, it could have been different in 1.12.
---
I just hope classic becomes insanely popular, and there can be multiple vannila expansions that don't corelate to the main game. Like a lvl 60 emerald dream expansion where our goal at launch isn't to get to a new level cap, but it to something else. Or a lvl 60 ICC ect
---
I'm convinced you don't know what words mean. 
---
Entitlement or elitist are both words you've used somewhat incorrectly in this thread alone. 
---
I know, and they do show that they listen to feedback. But until we hear more about sharding and actually see how they use it. I will be skeptic.
---
Regardless if it's classic or retail, the company is still the same.
---
I'm withholding judgment until we get a course correction re: RPvP servers. Additional clarification regarding the use/limitations of sharding would be nice as well, but that particular dead horse has been beaten to its subatomic components by this point.
---
That said, the six phases of content and no loot trading outside raids are certainly encouraging signs. Echoing another comment, At this point I'm willing to settle on cautious optimism for the time being.
---
Real talk. The lesson is, if you want loot first and foremost in WoW, go tank. You’ll get all the great loot you want, fast. Compared to the number of tanks, a lot of tank loot drops. Guilds and groups will be much more favourable and deferential towards you; you’ll be amazed at the OS/DPS gear you’ll pick up, the help you’ll get with things like quelserrar and guildruns, all the gear you’ll pick up in 5 mans where you didn’t invite another warrior... I could go on. 
---
It took my friends and I 3 months to hit 60 back in the day. I can hit 60 in 1.5 to 2 weeks now...why? In high school I really only had 2-4 hours to play on weeknights, and I could vegg on the weekends if I didn’t have any responsibilities.
---
Now? I can take vacation days, I work from home, and I don’t have kids. Now that I’m an adult, what is more difficult is saying “no” to getting up for 15 minutes to face an IRL responsibility during a 4 hour raid. 
---
Back in the day I was able to raid and played all content but naxx, and was definitely a “casual” by this subreddits standards. Now that I’m older, i actually have more autonomy and ability to sink hardcore levels of time into it, but i may need to raid in a more casual minded guild.
---
That’s fine with me though, I’m also more into the social aspect of voice comms and 40 people nerding out than I am about competing over fashion in ironforge now.
---
You bet yer ass i’ll be racing to 60 though!
---
Is this suitable for my bank alt? If so I will upvote to infinity and beyond.
---
now we take them, grab the retail art team (who are basically the only part of beta for azeroth that keeps the thing going) and make WoW great again
---
The Classic team is not the same team that made MoP/Legion. It's an entirely new team.
---
2006 launch had way less people and way more servers. It isnt the same. 
---
Pretty sure the manabomb turned Jaina gay. :V
---
Oh GOD. YES! EVERYONE REFUSES TO ROLL FIRST!
---
there are more things amiss with BC than just the addition of flying. The 'print 100g per day' dailies were the first tombstone for the economy
---
Most people would say duels are less important than bgs, but honestly all pvp is basically for shiggles in vanilla so if you want to chose a race just to be an Uber duel lord go for it.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for thanks.
---
I’ve seen more posts complaining about this supposed hate for hardcore players than I’ve actually seen hate for hardcore players. It’s about 4-0 now. 
---
100% true. Let the no change crowd soak in the awkwardness of classic bit. After a year or two people might be more open to slight classic style balance changes.
---
Please, please, *please* include an RP-PvP server 
---
I always use the cloth+enchanting trick to get a lesser magic wand as early as possible. Then save gold to buy a greater magic wand once I get back to Stormwind. After that its always cookies stirring rod. With Horde you obviously have to run BFD!
---
- No community
---
- Any player you see out in the world is likely to not be from your server, you may never see them again, they are essentially NPC's
---
- The game is largely played from a set of interfaces now, you queue up to be teleported to any dungeon, raid or PvP zone in the game. Exceptions are raids higher than "Easy" difficulty (which you have to travel to) and "Hard mode" mythic+ dungeons.
---
- Portals and flying everywhere (except in the latest continent) diminishes the feeling of a living world.
---
- It feels like you have no control over the progression of your character. Item set bonuses are gone, an 'Azerite' system has been introduced which is an endless grind and is widely disliked.
---
- Every piece of gear has a chance to "Titanforge" - meaning increase several item levels and be super powerful. This means that someone completing the easiest difficulty of raids can gain pieces of gear on the level of the highest difficulty content in the game.
---
- No new abilities or talents in the latest expansion. Classes have been streamlined heavily, including the removal of "flavour" situational abilities.
---
- All loot is now personal, meaning after defeating a boss you have a personal roll to see if you get loot. This is enforced even on raiders, master loot has been removed from the game.
---
- As above, the game often rewards luck and small time commitments (daily quests) over skill, which contributes to a feeling of the target audience shifting towards people who only have a couple of hours per week to play.
---
Thankfully, these are decisions that Activision doesn’t care about. Blizzard is still a good developer.
---
Here it is: https://i.imgur.com/nMlCENO.png
---
Servers aren't expensive like they were back then. Problem solved 
---
Onyxia pug is the most popular raid pug on pservers and loot reservation of the best things is standard there.
---
WoW went from MMORPG to a shared world single player RPG.
---
Now you can even raid without having to interact with people, just pretend that all the LFR/LFG people are dumb AI bots.
---
Alex Jones, is that you?
---
Too many servers would lead to dead populations after a few months. This is a big problem in Classic where the game will be based around community. 
---
It’s kind of funny to me how MoP is now looked back upon fondly as one of the better expansions. I remember when it was announced people were more polarized than ever, and even for a while after its launch the general atmosphere among the community was that WoW was dead or dying.
---
It’s when I stopped playing WoW entirely (mainly due to life changes but I had also lost a significant amount of interest at this point) and my memory of it is hazy at best. I remember enjoying the Pandaren, the Monk class, and the early zones but I fizzled out because I had hit max level by the end of the second questing zone and didn’t find it engaging enough to keep going after that. What was it about MoP that makes people consider it one of the good expansions?
---
That is a worry, or would be if loot trading for 5 mans was in the game. Since it isn't, you don't have to worry about that.
---
2.0x is vanilla. 2.0x has shaman DW. 'Vanilla' didn't freeze at 1.12, 2.0x lasted longer.
---
I played both sides in Vanilla with about half my time alliance and half the time horde. I liked the quest storylines more alliance side and I liked the players more on the horde.  I'm playing horde again.
---
Lol it’s funny to me that people would even have this mentality. When I was playing classic WoW “hardcore” vs “casual” didn’t even cross my mind. There was such a broad spectrum of players that every type was well represented. It was what made the community so great in the first place.
---
As someone running pug raids I'd really like this to be a toggle. Still gonna be a pain in the ass for me
---
But I did 2h after the dw patch. It never left. It's just a play choice, why force yours?

---
Ubers is also considered a dungeon in reguards to loot trading so this technically isn't correct
---
I think I'm on a list just for listening to this. Guild chat is a special place.
---
Merging servers is also signifcantly easier nowadays than it was back then. Again, problem solved 
---
In 1.12, the savory taste of chain heal.
---
Never said recruits don't or shouldn't get gear, it's just a very common thing to see them ask for weapons/trinkets/tier gear on their first run. 
---
Whatever happened to #nochanges? Blizzard is removing a function of Vanilla and you guys are not only not bitching, but celebrating?
---
You lot make zero sense.
---
I was way too young and started playing around 5 years old but  at the end of BC but my dad had one with an Orc on it.
---
Nobody used em because you had to run to the dungeon to trigger the LFG, if you’re at the dungeon already, you usually have a group already. Aint nobody got time for flying/running 40 minutes to SM unless they already have a group
---
You’ll be seeing less humans and orcs, since their racials were both broken in Vanilla.
---
I keep hearing this but I wonder if more people won't roll alliance warlock this time around
---
For PvE. Most would be warrior and least would probably be hunter.
---
This is so true. Fuck having midgets and dwarves on your team ugly ass mofos. I wanna hang with the bony and moo bois
---
Weird flex but okay
---
Yep. STV was possibly one of the greatest concepts to ever bless gaming.
---
Or course. They should be able to get gear, just as much as anyone else in the raid.
---
Why shouldn't they?
---
I've never been a big fan of grinding BGs for items which is why I spent 90% of my time playing AB and WSG in vanilla, but AV has that damn quiver that's best in slot for my hunter.  As such, I'd rather have 1.12 just to get the grind over with.  Take that item out of AV and I'd be happy to play the old versions.
---
I'd really prefer that BGs have no item grinds associated with them because I generally run BGs for fun, not gear.
---
Lol,  back in the day my friend only played female characters. When I asked him why, he said, "if I'm going to look at an ass for hours a day, I'd rather it be a females ass"  brilliant dude. 
---
Dynamic respawns creates other problems that sharding can avoid for the early parts of the game.
---
On pservers dynamic respawning had made some caves inaccessible by solo players or duos trying to quest.
---
It has also been abused by parties to nonstop grind gaining way too much xp too fast in a fashion that was not intended in Vanilla.
---
I'm sorry for your loss.
---
Can't wait to find out!
---
My old Guild Master used to say: Ganking builds character.   Learning how to escape, defeat, or call in some friends for revenge made leveling in Vanilla feel more real than the solo sort of stuff in retail.
---
I was on an RP server (Cenarion Circle) back then and I cant disagree with your experience of most players not being dedicated RP’er’s. In fact, I was a solid member of Group A in your distinction (as was at least 85-90% of the server) and tbh I never saw that as a bad thing.
---
I think most of the server population respected that it was an RP server even if most interactions were OOC. Seeing RP’er’s RP’ing wasn’t uncommon and they were almost always left alone or even joined by players who wanted to give it a shot, and usually when people were rude they were ignored or told to stop by others.
---
What it seemed to offer for the average player was a common appreciate of the lore/story amongst the server population, more creative/immersive character names (well more often than you’d see on a normal server at least), generally mature players (again, relative to normal servers), the occasional fun RP event, and funny/cool IC trade channel ads.
---
If you were a hardcore RP’er then I can definitely see why you’d be disappointed but for most other players it was a fun, slightly more immersive experience.
---
People are saying they are completely different games, and in a sense they are not wrong. However I'd recommending picking up retail, and learning the game. When you are confident in it learn how to use keybinds. Bind your moves to different keys. Itll help out tremendously when it drops. 
---
Oh, for me, it's absolutely just gold selling spammers. Couldn't care less about anything actual players say that may or may not be reportable. I just ignore them. That's too easy. Gold spammers though? A scourge that should be dealt with.
---
MC is ez to pug and T1 is real nice for PvP and not so sought after for PvE, so that is a bonus
---
Anyone can make Elemental work if you're thrifty. Here's a character that did: [https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=1064673](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=1064673)
---
Everything he's wearing is available from quests, the auction house, or UBRS, with the sole exception of the boots (which are from ZG). Those can be replaced with an "of nature's Wrath" green from the auction house, losing only 1-2 spell power.
---
Apologies in advance to the mods if Legacyplayers is frowned upon.
---
Nope.  It's only useful for escaping ganks and running by mobs that you might normally aggro on you in dungeons.  
---
I understand your disappointment but as someone who was in that Group A from very early vanilla I just want you to know that the experience was awesome and made me appreciate the good RP’ers on the server.
---
oh damn i was planning on trying to be an enhance shaman with hand of rag for pvp, does this obliterate that build?
---
Everyone knows doot bois and milky moos are the true BFF races.
---
Start here https://open.spotify.com/user/-sploosh-/playlist/0UZC3SdtPB33FbroY9J1nl
---
Blizzard's turning the frogs gay!
---
Most gear dependent in pvp: Warrior, Warlock, Spriest, Elly. With bad gear they are all depressing to play but with good gear they turn into literal gods. 
---
Least gear dependent in pvp: Mage, Rogue, Hunter. They don’t need much gear to shine because of all the control, survivability and utility they have. 
---
There's nothing wrong with asking or rolling. It's just that in my experience seniority played a huge roll in who got upgrades. 
---
I mean sure we could promote Steve who just joined us to assistant manager, but Bob has been gunning for the position for 6 months now. Who's to say Bob won't up and quit if we promote Steve, more or less if Steve is even a real team player that will stick around for a while.
---
Air totem quest
---
I believe that have 1.6 and beyond or something like that, as we were informed during Blizzcon.
---
But I understand the AV thing. The BG was flawed and unrewarding honor/rep wise early on and I'm one of those people who wants exalted so I can gtfo for good.
---
What they changed it to isn't great, but it seemed like to the only way to make a flawed BG less flawed in my eyes.
---
It really depends. Every class is extremely gear dependent at 60. Its the only way to progress at that point. 
---
Leveling up to 60? Warrior is the most gear dependent, and Warlock is probably the least gear dependent, followed by Hunter.
---
That was the realm I played on back in the day. Fucking No Mercy Mafia.
---
I applied, and was accepted (age 34ish I think).  Never used my free month of play that they gave me for applying, cause at the time I was willing to pay for what they were offering.  Come Caty, I didn't even want a free month.  It wasn't worth a free month.
---
I'd like my free month once classic comes out though.  :)
---
The entrance for horde and alliance are still there in southern azshera, clearly marked with alliance and horde banners. 
---
The actual BG (along with most azshera content including quests and timbermaw hold) are also missing.
---
Horizontal progression.
---
Include gear to flesh out specs that have little while not increasing the acactual item level or raw stats of the gear past what is already present.
---
I.e. tanking paladin gear.
---
Bingo, horizontal progression so all raid content in vanilla is still and always relevant.
---
Add in item sets and gear that fills out needed gear for specs that don't have sets, or any gear at all available for them.
---
Short answer yes.
---
I leveled alliance in vanilla,I faction xfered to horde in bc and only played horde on private servers.  But human sword passive and Paladins is too much to give up playing on classic blizzard servers also 
---
FUCK HORDE ONY ATTUNEMENT 
---
-Smite priest and ret pali
---
-druid / elemental shaman and enhance shaman 
---
Two uncommon, but good combos 
---
I played from day 1 in vanilla, having 500 hundred people in the human starting zone made questing impossible.  I honestly don't have a problem with until around level 10.  After that, fuck that shit.  
---
Charge and Blink close to the ground avoid fall damage.
---
So much fun in AB.
---
The un'goro raptor.
---
They were an attempt to fix one problem (the sparsity of flight points in classic) and they've created half a dozen other problems in the process.
---
Open PvP? down to an all time low.
---
Mining/Herbalism? Speed up massively without the need to fight or stealth your way through hordes of enemies to get to those spawn nodes.  
---
Immersion? Why should I bother about your carefully created world to tell me about the state of things along the way when I can just fly over it and not give a flip about it.  
---
For what it's worth Daily Quests created the same problem. A tool to get players to do something in the world and also to fill in an option to generate gold for classes who aren't that good at (or players who aren't that interested in) grinding. But they in turn have marked the downfall for the economy in the game with the low effort money printing press that was handed out to everyone with them.
---
Youre making my point here. The point is AV isnt fun and youre taking the rewards for granted, when epics are meant to be a challenge. Again, for some reason, youre EXPECTING to get gear out of AV and as you said, you played AB and WSG for fun, but the rewards would have still been really beneficial. nobody EXPECTS to easily get AB and WSG gear, so why should you EXPECT to just get AV gear? Why should the lowest time sink by far give great rewards? Because it isnt fun? Thats retail level of design. The answer is simply that none of these things should be true.
---
At least old AV had balanced levels of rep gain and hell, ive actually heard people want it because they enjoyed it, I still have yet to hear someone that likes AV 1.12
---
I am in the same exact boat as you. I think I am going to decide based off of what class I play.
---
As much as I want to try it DM north solo on my hunter, it shouldn't be possible.  Now maybe with 2 hunters... that would be fun.
---
Damn never thought I would relive that! Mine for sure was declined, I remember wanting one so bad. 
---
I hate letter armour!
---
Is it true as a Warlock in Vanilla, all your fire spells are basically unused? I want to play warlock, but if that was the case, I'll look elsewhere.
---
Oh damn I didn't think of that, that would just complicate things for them even more. I sure hope they hit the nail on the head with the amount of servers from the get go so they don't have to add more
---
As someone who started late-Vanilla and raided in TBC, I can confirm the teal Shamans.
---
Well after 5 or 6 resses your res timer will be so long most people will think you logged off and will go somewhere else so that's one solution I guess.
---
Hmm yeah, he does like to melee more than is ideal but I believe some of it was justified:
---
1st fight vs the 1st two hunters he purposely went in to melee them because most hunters did panic in melee range back then; plus, he had a weapon advantage with his Arc Reaper.   
---
(You can even read his PM chat at 3:30 where he talks about how successful he is meleeing hunters down.)
---
2nd vs the mage he took a few steps in to wingclip to slow because conc shot was on CD and obviously he couldn't outrun a mage without slowing 1st.
---
3rd vs the warrior it looks like he was just closing the gap to deny intercept stun.
---
4th vs the hunter, he raped him by meleeing.
---
5th vs the rogue it looks like he just wing clipped him as he ran past to get the speedboost and/or run away from the mage behind him.
---
6th vs the warrior, very bad opener. It looks like he took meleeing way to far there. But he follows it up vs the rogue with some of the cleanest kiting ive seen(for the time).  
---
My main point in calling this guy good is the time period. This was video released a year before Vurtne 1. Almost all hunters were straight dogshit back then. I mean Wesly is autowinning fights vs hunters just by engaging them in melee range, lmao.  
---
This bis list don't include items that got updated with 1.10  :/
---
To be frank, it's because 90% of people here are pserver users and they are legitimately the most toxic community I've ever met. You you see /r wow servers it's even worse than here. It won't be like that in classic for the most part because there will be so many people who aren't from pservers there.
---
A nice big Tauren butt preferably
---
Ad many of the people you kill for no reason will come back and camp you because you killed them unprovoked. This is why camping basically self balances - if you're the type of person that ganks others you end up getting killed many more times than someone who doesn't kill on sight.
---
DR was in the game since the 0.8 beta. The thing is that blind was not on the same DR as cheap shot nor kindey shot till cata as it was a disorient and factored into the incapacitate DR like hunter traps, grenades, repentance - not the stun DR  
---
A lot of people can't get past the panda aesthetic. From a pure gameplay perspective, I don't know that the game has ever been better than it was in MoP.
---
That's not to say that it didn't have problems, but every version of WoW has problems, even the ones people praise.
---
Wait... Really. You gotta shift out to have a potion?
---
To add onto how to mark targets:
---
I always bind the marks to numpad0-6
---
Skull =Num0 and will be the first kill target.
---
Who are these Blizzard you speak of, do you mean Activi$$$ion by any chance?
---
It was my favorite zone to hang out in since it was usually pretty quiet, (before Azuregos I believe) I would mine and gather felcloth do some fishing then hit up that naga temple for a rare named "Jinhoo"  or something like that he would drop a blue sword often worth a bit of gold.
---
they listen more than the retail team for sure
---
You shouldn't ever plan around a legendary item. Especially not one that costs around 1000 gold.
---
That being said, enhancement is enhancement. Sometimes you oneshot clothies with a triple-crit. Sometimes you hit a warrior for 250 and wonder why you didn't go elemental. It is, even moreso than ret, based entirely on how well you can roll the dice.
---
That, and the fact people are wanting to relive classic WoW as it was, where the vast majority of players were clueless by today's standards.
---
Goddammit Kaivax, I can only get so erect. 
---
Really hoping that they hear what's being said about AV, I think there's a good middle ground between the 24 hour AVs and the trains passing in the night that can be found. 
---
Classic blizzard. Bending over backwards to stop a small percentage of players who might be dicks 
---
UD females when attacking with fists have one hand planted on the ground and swipe with the other. they also do flips when you heroic strike not sure about other classes though 
---
This will also prevent ninja looting, or it should. Master looter in raids can just loot everything and hand out the gear directly.
---
Immolate has it's uses in levelling, pvp and dungeons, it's a good dps spell as long as things survive it's duration. For raiding no, there just isn't room with 16 debuffs for any dps dots, every debuff slot is accounted for with damage increasing debuffs that provide a far bigger dps increase in 40 man raids. Warlock raiding should always be CoS(or CoE/CoR) and shadowbolt spam. Anything else is sub-optimal.
---
Wait wut? Kaivax is Randy?!! That is awesome!!
---
Randy was not only on the Instance, he was the GM of AIE too!
---
In probs gonna get lost in the comments here but... does anybody know what date or month classic is gonna be released?
---
Gnomes technically with int but it's an very small difference, less than 1%. Nothing like human for warriors for example (4%+).
---
Do you have examples so not going to say what your bitching about, just bitching.  Not super helpful.
---
not gonna happen, they just put 2 toys on the ingame shop this week 
---
That's before diminishing returns. Not that case anymore.
---
wait wtf that actually sounds sweet
---
1. With a healer as a duo you will go faster as a pure DPS spec, there is no need for prot talents until BiS hunting. With Peircing Howl and Earthbind Totem you don't need the stun which is dependent on a dodge or parry. 
---
2. Battle shout is pretty good AoE threat as long as you are hitting all 5 party members. We used this as a strategy on the Nef adds in phase 1 back in 2006.
---
The issue was never that it was possible, it was that it was virtually undetectable.  Ninjas will be ninjas and it happens.  As long as people realized they're being stolen from and can prove it,  at least they can take community action.  Loot trading would have made it invisible.
---
the legendary is just an end-game goal i want to go for. im sure most of my time progressing will be nightfall bitch duty.
---
True.
---
A man of culture I see.
---
Nope DR came in 1.2 or 1.3
---
Same name.. different games. 
---
I'd say both are worth a try really. One won't ruin the other for you I don't think.
---
Searing pain is good if your target is going to die before you can get a shadowbolt off. Rain of fire/hellfire are used for AoE.
---
Fire spells are really good for PvP if you are conflag build
---
Sulfuras is only really any good in the MC/BWL days, though. Much stronger weapons come out in AQ and Naxx.
---
That being said, Enhancement shaman will always have priority on 2h weapons in more serious guilds, since no warriors benefit more from them than dual wielding.
---
For god’s sake. RP-PVPers are a minority. You don’t get to have everything you want.
---
Sharding only in starter zones is the only other things I care about. 1-10 sharding seems very reasonable, but please don't force it through the rest of the experience. If someone on my server is in the same location as me, I want to see them and not be sharded based on population.
---
Mobs and players afflicted by fear always run in the direction the caster is facing initially, after a second or two it becomes purely random.
---
Why.
---

Every song from the greatest pvp video of all time***
---
I understand its a very scummy thing to do, but you have to realize people will always take the path of least resistance so I was pointing out a potential situation that could be troublesome.  Not everyone upholds to the moral standards that we wish they did and you have to know that people will abuse the system anyway they can to get ahead of honest players.
---
I'm not defending blizzard... I was just responding to the comment "letting the big boys make the decisions is what got retail to the state it's in in the first place", which isn't true. You're right, blizzard listened too much, but that's the opposite problem than he suggested.
---
Kind of overstating it there. Their "core philosophy" is to literally replicate a proven successful game. 
---
Meanwhile in terms of retail, they're pretty much the only company still heavily investing in the MMO space. Everything they're doing is new. Innovating for 13+ years is not easy, and its not an easy rollback when people don't like a core system like Azerite. Can't just be like "Woops sorry about that, we're scrapping like half the content in the expansion because thats what the community wants." 
---
They're easy to sort and find in classicdb if you want, I'm not sure how excel is more useful but whatever floats your boat. I'm sure someone with some mad skillz could pull them out and into excel automagically.  
---
I'm pretty sure by Classic's release there'll be addons that will have everything you ever need quest wise so personally I wouldn't go ham with it.
---
What a good trained Classicast parrot. If they didn't have it they would have said it. They said they chose 1.12
---
In a world where you can play as an ancient mysterious elf, an orc from an alien homeworld, or a cunning reanimated forsaken, and yet playing the other gender is just too far fetched.
---
But you can stack Curse of Recklessness with any of the above.
---
Dude wtf? That’s not casual in the slightest. Here I am thinking I’m def not a casual and then I read comments like this. What in the actual hell...
---
Tigole Bitties himself. 
---
It was mainly because of pandas for some weird reason. I guess suddenly WoW players decided that WoW had always been this refuge for gritty and realistic high fantasy aesthetic and then kung fu panda came along and make it for children?  
---
Anyway, MoP had some great content (loved questing in Pandaria, great dungeons, great raids, absolutely loved Timeless Isle, amazing soundtrack).  
---
My only complaint was it being the start of Blizz's crusade against finally gutting the game of its RPG aspects and any kind of complexity. There had always been "streamlining" but with MoP into WoD they went at it hard and made all my favorite specs almost unplayable due to how dull and simple they became.
---
I haven't played recently but I know Sombra and Doomfist were both thrower-level bad when they first released. Like your team would literally report you for playing them. So it seems like its more of an evolving game rather than one with a major development problem. 
---
Yeah, that's a shame my friend, I always go back to Vanilla even after 15 years it's my favorite game. If it's the only game I play I would remain happy. I think the RP community is going to gain such a great game in Classic, and I look forward to all new adventures with brand new communities. I'm gonna keep trying to pushing for the servers, if we don't try then will fail for certain, but as long as we keep voicing our views there might be chance for our server : )
---
This sub is about 40 percent Blizzard astroturfing 40 percent private server players and 20 percent people too stupid to know Classicast are just Blizzard influencers who parrot what Activision wants.  
---
That's why you see AV hated because the private server community is about 500 mentally ill people who rank 18 hours a day for 3 months a year, but see Esfand's videos voted down and the Blizzard shills cancelled out because they know he and Classicast are all frauds. 
---
DUF - Discord Unit Frames
---
&gt;  The only exception to this is raids,
---
Isn't it true for raids? There's no class that's not used at all, you'll surely find a place eventually?
---
two words: GOLD SPAMMERS
---
It sucks that after a major victory(for classic fans and blizzard) that there are still obvious things we need to fight against. Like how hard is nochanges to understand. At least they have shown they are listening and that makes me happier about classics chances.
---
bring lots of pillows
---
The classic youtubers should probably stop making such bullshit videos about these blue posts and still cry about that they want different things
---
This spell will drain mana. Are you sure you wish to cast “Smite (Rank 1)”?
---
based on your post history, you are the one trolling
---
Yeah exactly, same with ours / being dedicated that is.
---
I dont think it'll be *that* boring
---
Well the plan is to make everything easily accessible, and then hop on a private server and make a couple guides in the excel document for the leveling route I want to take. The entire master list is for my OCD.
---
They really don't understand he is simply pointing out a flaw in the system that WILL be abused.  I can literally see this very well written post flying over all these peoples heads.
---
Literally in the book on manipulating people. Ask for something absurd so that when you ask for something minor it seems less absurd. It's still absurd.
---
Nothing more "classic" about the WoW community than constant whining and complaining
---
Thanks for the input, although my biggest goal is to make a guide on the specific route I want to take. I want to attempt to do every quest while I am leveling to get as much city rep as possible.
---
&gt;  If I am going to be looking at something's backside for hours on end it's gonna be a female.
---
Unfortunately, that's the "virgin pretending to convince everyone he's not a virgin" argument, though.
---
I'm not saying you're a virgin, but most people are not playing video games with concern for their boners as a motivating factor.
---
I listened to that show during Cata but couldn't remember which one was Randy. Here's his last episode: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/frogpants-studios/the-instance-world-of-warcraft-podcast/e/4586835
---
It's effectively them asking for something ridiculous so that when they ask for something minor you are like "That sounds reasonable." lol.
---
I’m totally on the fence but leaning alliance. Would you explain more what you liked about it to help me out? :)
---
Mages are the best by far for leveling especially horde
---
That shit will probably be tens times that if your guild isn’t handing you all the mats.
---
[(repost)](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/85dzg7/how_many_servers_do_you_think_blizzard_should/dvxv11e/)
---
Looking at US servers the population was still evenly split during vanilla slightly in favor of PvE.
---
1,377,582 PvE (55%) vs 1,119,413 PvP (45%)
---
I excluded RP servers in the above numbers. Yea the numbers might be off a little as it requires people to run an addon, but the gap between the two isn't as far off as people make it.
---
[source](https://web.archive.org/web/20061113150043/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/realmstats.php)

Looking at the EU the favor is the opposite.
---
788,783 PvE (45%) vs 944,006 PvP (55%)

---
&gt;even for a while after its launch the general atmosphere among the community was that WoW was dead or dying.
---
I mean they lost like 3-4 million subscribers during MoP. So as much as people now think of it as "good" it clearly wasn't good enough for people to pay a sub for at the time.
---
Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath never lost subscribers quarter-to-quarter.
---
The only male character I absolutely refuse to play are Night Elf casters. Ever since my kid pointed out that night elf males look like they are taking a dump when casting, I couldn't play them anymore. Fortunately, night elf females actually have amazing cast animations.
---
Not sure how many times people have to say this before the rest will understand.
---
Bigger servers = farming and the economy going to shit. Unless you want em to implement dynamic respawn on herbs, mobs and ores (in which case sharding would be more Classic then that solution)
---
Remeber that the only reason the pserver community can work in any form is because of these changes that are no where close to blizzlike. Have fun on the mega servers where black lotus have a 2 hour spawn time but also now have 2-5 times the players on it. And you people complain about loot trading but never see the bigger picture
---
Play a bear tank. Your ass will fill up 2/3rds of the screen.
---
Can I be that single ret in yours? :D (what?)
---
I just don't want every group being "LFM Deadmines: Rogues and Mages only link YouTube video of Rag kill back in 2005 and have BiS for level 18."
---
I kid, I kid. But I think some people are really just worried about not being able to raid unless they already know absolutely everything about end game vanilla.
---
&gt;  Part of it feels weird to me though. What's your take on it?
---
It's only weird if you rub your nipples while playing
---
&gt;The Classic team is completely detached from the main Blizzard design team and decision makers writ large. They've been given a mandate for Classic specifically, and sure they're doing a good job.
---
We've known this from the start of the announcement. The Classic team told us very early on that they were independent and their goal was bringing back the Vanilla experience as closely as they can.
---
Also you need to compare Bfa search before release
---
level one chain heal. That is resto HPS spec. it is fun, but a lot of your healing will be sniped by the priests in the raid. If you have a raid group who is going hard in the paint and you prove yourself to be high enough APM they might let you into the melee group to totem weave while pressing level 1 chain heal. The spec is not for everyone, but they are a necessary support component for raids on horde. If you are going for server firsts, however, you play alliance because pallys are just better support all around. But as a shaman your mdps will love you if you can keep WF and grace up all the time.
---
They will probably do it for starting areas at launch.
---
The best way to get motivated for Classic is to play a few hours of retail
---
Healers don't really have rotations, it's more about assessing the situation and using the heal that lines up best with that situation.
---
With that being said resto is a lot of chain heal, sometimes you can pop out a healing wave if you feel a bit spicy but single target healing is not the shamans forte.
---
If you want to be a real try hard *BIGBOI* shaman you can totem twist to give the dps a little boost, this might not work in real classic tho.
---
It doesnt fix abusing loot trading in pugs.
---
I would still pref having absolutely no loot trading and no blizzard intervention of missloots, but it's a huge win.
---
That was the favicon for Thottbot.
---
[source](https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224147/http://www.thottbot.com/)
---
So if you have owned the game at any point in time, during any expansion, you are not going to be able to play the game you already purchased for just the sub cost?  There is no way this is right.
---
Can’t you make a custom one through some banks with whatever pic you want? 
---
SL Warlocks are top tier in PvP and solo content. There are a whole bunch of classes that are more afraid of warlocks than of mages.
---
“Then” is used with time, whereas “Than” is used for comparisons. So, no. 
---
Most druids spec down in swiftmend, which is pretty damn closing to regular healing spec no?
---
I'm out of the loop, finding now!
---
&gt;  good expansion (MoP)
---
not so fast
---
Perfection. absolutely beautiful!
---
Haha, great titles, my memory is worse than I thought. 
---
That video was made literally weeks after launch of the game, people didn't have full prebis by then. You know why? Because I was a hunter on those dps sheets. We quickly felt below any good warrior and rogue. We still did pretty decent dps, but not top at all.
---
No, they don't actually have it.  If you've got more free time than brains, go read all the blue posts from the PVP forum from the past 10 years and find where they say it.  I've campaigned for Old AV for years before they ever thought of making Classic.  They don't have it anymore.
---
Sure. I'm not 100 percent convinced either, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. We'll see. 
---
This is the video game version of the Tortoise and the Hare
---
This was a quote from the original designer of 'Tomb Raider'.  Yes, part of my brain has been reserved for decades preserving that useless trivia.
---
Its funny what happens when you listen and give the community what they want or at least come up with a reasonable middle ground instead of arbitrarily making changes.
---
Or you could just do what people already do and kick the people you don't want to roll on the item right before the boss dies.
---
I think it's more on what complaints Blizzard listens to rather than what complaints are made.
---
Don't get confused here. Post above you talks specifically about raiding where resto shamans are preferred over ele/enh and the author also has a huge bias against healing, which is IMO way more involved than raid DPS.
---
In PvP ele/resto shamans are an absolute beast and they are *not* gear dependand. Gear makes things easier for every class. This is the same misconception as people have with Warriors because they are weak solo PvPers but can partly overcome that with superiour gear, but they shine in group PvP regardless.
---
Shamans are the same: weak in comparison in solo PvP but extremely strong in group PvP because they are a support class. Purge, shocks and totems can shut down a variety of classes and gimmicks and their ranged healing and lightning spells are very effective in group vs group PvP.
---
People who have a bias against supporting/healing will look down on classes like shamans. They don't understand the depth that comes with them, because they never really tried to be the best support they can be. Shaman specifically has an inbuilt system of tradeoffs with shocks and totems and a good number of reactive abilities that push their skill-ceiling through the roof.
---
HELL YES. blizzard just keeps impressing me!!!!
---
First aid + cooking will get it done.
---
Also ignore stamina on gear. You will always get it but it wont speed up leveling.
---
Str and Agi will increase your damage which speeds up kills. 
---
Spirit will increase your regeneration, getting you back in the fight sooner.
---
Stam just increases your health pool, making you need to eat longer. When you have more HP than you heal from full 25 sec. Of eating you are just wasting time. 
---
Casuals are afraid that the hardcore circle is going to make them unwelcome in the community and at level 60.
---
Why don't YOU find something they never stated, when in their AV post they said they chose this turd and then laid out their idiotic reasons why. Let me help you out. Modern Blizzard cares more about streamers/influencers than gamers. They don't want a smart audience anymore. They want a dumb one who buys MT's and that lives vicariously through other people, while spending what little cash they have on Sylvanas funko pop dolls and other stupid crap.
---
The next big change that they will sell as no changes is cross realm BG's btw. It's all about their dumb influencers and easy content. It's not about us anymore son. Now go through the shills some patreon money.
---
I am so happy right now!
---
I wouldn't mind this as long as they didn't change the core of the game mechanics
---
I love compromising with #changes
---
Instead of big changes, many small changes.
---
Will you be playing on a PvP server?
---
Also, they really can't rollback certain features now that the classic community doesn't like because the playerbase that is currently playing the game won't play without them.
---
We see what happened when they tried taking flying away, just imagine the immense backlash if they try to take away LFD/LFR or something like that.
---
Honestly, I'm convinced he practices what he preaches. But yes, you're right. He's defining the crime, lol
---
All the power to ya, if you want to do it go for it.
---
Just seems like you are just as bored as all of us, and can’t figure out how to cope before release :)
---
&gt; good expansion
---
This should be prefaced with: 'compared to the atrociously bad ones'. In reality they've failed on every expansion to correct things they've fucked up in the past (e.g. fixing class homogenization, consolidating raid difficulties, mandating player interaction through group quests/harder heroics/raids not being puggable, making questing non-linear, removing gap closers from every class, healing from every class, fixing stat inflation every expansion, etc etc etc)
---
This legit triggered me back in the day. Hated this wall of false equivalency and stupidity. 
---
u can play both
---
You will improve your kiting with strafe keys bound.
---
If you are changing up your key blinds I would suggest giving ESDF a try. 
---
It provides more options for unmodified key binds, puts your index finger on the F key which has the reference marker, and is natural for typing.
---
You can also benefit from trying to avoid backing up as you move much slower. Try and turn sideways and strafe away, jumping will let you flick around and get an arcane or sting off mid air.
---
Yep this is it right here. The Pandas and the japanese-style just didn't feel like "warcraft" to me. It was a great expansion, and even aesthetic wise everything looked great! It's just that the art *style* and pandas kind of ruined it.
---
That is exactly the problem. Tired of waiting, since I heard about Classic I haven’t even been able to play other games.
---
You could just farm gold normally. And probabaly make way more gold per hour. Plus not waste a ton of other peoples time and become a shit stain lol.
---
I feel like you are not even meaning to troll, but it's just naturally what occupies your time
---
name plates and/tar can get around this
---
What is so hard to comprehend about the fact we want to play Vanilla, not a remastered version of modern day BFA loot trading?
---
WHY IS THIS HARD TO UNDERSTAND?
---
HOWEVER LOOT TRADING WAS IN WOW, keep it at that 
---
MoP is imo the best class design in the game's history. It was exceptional nearly across the board. It's also got 2 of the top 5 or so raids Blizzard has ever released in ToT and SoO.
---
You can dislike MoP if you want, but it was objectively well-designed from a PvE standpoint (daily quest debacle in 5.0 aside).
---
I just condense it down to pvpers and raiders. Not having to deal with the autists that just want to pet battle or think that dungeons should be a legit source  of end game gear, or only collect mounts/xmog. 
---
Nah those play styles can fuck ofd imho and all those players can leave. You either raid, pvp, or both. 
---
I don't think it's as black and white as you're making it out to be. 
---
WoW was always kind of cartoony and humorous with some dark themes sprinkled in, but if there is a spectrum between real/gritty and cartoony/child-like, WoW hit a great balance with the base game and first 3 expansions, and MoP just pushed the art style too far into the cartoony/child-like side of the spectrum for people's enjoyment.
---
Just don’t burn out classic before it’s even released!
---
I always played Horde, and decided to try Alliance on a pserver while I wait for classic.
---
Couldn’t get through the first zone, just felt wrong.
---
Azerite failed in beta, long before launch. Everyone covering the systems had plenty of terrible things to say about azerite. 
---
I just hope blizzard has finally learned their lesson about this one and done per expansion gimmick bullshit. 
---
I tried OSRS. Made a character, went out to wintertodt, hit 99fm. Started on agility but I wasn’t really having fun and just found myself browsing classic info instead.
---
Look at those downvotes. Got to love the Activision astroturfing that tries to control the narrative of this sub. You are supposed to say that retail is a great game, but just not for you. Haven't you learned this from all the Blizzard influencers by now?
---

As punishment say 3 Hail Mary's and watch 10 Classicast videos. Might I suggest one when they were given a media pass and exclusive interviews? As always with shills, watch their videos with adblock on...
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKvIx6eQpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKvIx6eQpA) 
---
Negative.  20 hours piecemeal is infinitely easier and less stressful than even a 4 hour block, never mind 8.  I'll leave the raiding to the bachelors of the world &lt;3
---
That's exactly it, this is the kind of issue where unless you think they are wilfully ignoring feedback the worst-case scenario just was not going to happen.
---
They basically made them the most obnoxious chars to play against. Buffing Sombra's hack to nearly instant, and Doomfist had absolutely insane CC potential for a while (it's since been nerfed a bit).
---
The OW meta is not in a good place right now, and it hasn't been for nearly a year. I personally don't believe shooters should have much, if any, CC in them. It just breaks the game in a lot of ways.
---
If Ford or some other American car company went back "to the roots" and made a utilitarian, no frills basic car  that could be maintained entirely with common hand tools, like an updated Model A or Model T, and sold it for under 10 grand, there would definitely be a market for that.
---
I would definitely buy one.
---
Such a shitty argument
---
The day WoW goes back to X list of predefined items from Y boss with the only rng being did your wanted item drop and did you get it from the masterlooter, is the day I stop badmouthing blizzard. 
---
But that day will never happen. If I could blood sacrifice all the blizzard employees in charge I would, but not even a higher power can unfuck what they did to a once glorious game. 
---
I think you have that reversed.  
---
And I hope every retard that buys those toys dies of an easy preventable disease :)
---
Get that fake asian shit out of my western mmo. 
---
This did not apply to yellow attacks, though
---
I will say that he played very level headed with no panic, and was better than the average hunter for sure, just based on reaction time. You did sway me a bit here.
---
It's great in PvP, available before Unstoppable Force. There are better out there, but Epic &gt;&gt; Blues
---
It looks good, but I'll never forget the way the bent Diablo over and fucked the ever loving shit out of it and its fans. 
---
Only because of jeff. And jeff needs to be moved back and kept on the wow team and overwatch can be left to fuck off and cater to all the undesirables it has brought into the blizzard fanbase. 
---
The only version I played of WoW was vanilla. Every other version I quit within a few months. Except for MoP. I'm not going to pretend MoP was anything but a single player MMO, that's what WoW is... but the world was fun. The Chinese spin on it was refreshing. 
---
Sometimes story and design can compensate for shit MMO design.
---
I'm not going to fight the tide. I'll be one of the 8 warriors in Raid.
---
Because every warrior should learn to tank and have a shield on them if they want to 5man.
---
Druids don't care because there are very few of them, easy to find a guild. Also it is viable to let them off-tank if they are tryhards. Their average healing output being lower than other healers is partly due to a higher skill requirement. It is quite a bit more tricky to heal as a druid, but their ceiling is very high. In PvP they are nearly unmatched in duels/solo content and good skirmishers, flag carriers and incredible CC machines.
---
Shamans have no issues in raiding, they are a very much preferred class. You want to bring as many as possible to fill your healing slots. In PvP they are the strongest offensive supports between offensive totems, dispell, chain lightning and have decent healing spells to top off their frontline.
---
Palladins are extremely efficient and reliable healers and provide buffs that are unmatched in terms of power. No issues at all in raiding. In PvP they are the strongest defensive supports and healers.
---
Warlocks really pick up after AQ/Naxx in raiding. Their output doesn't lag behind as much as some people make it out to be and you quite simply *need* them for certain encounters. In PvP an SL lock is one of the scariest things ever.
---
Hunters are a class with a very high skill ceiling that also attracts a lot of players who can't make use of it, so it gets a bad rep. But they can be competitive with other ranged DPS (Mages, Warlocks) and don't actually lag behind that much statistically. In PvP they are the best skirmishers because of their mobility, spammable instant CC effects, superiour range. they have the ability to grind down almost any other class if played well.
---
most important job for a dps in a 5-man is CC and warriors have none
---
Druid/ druid.... Again why no people see this
---
Mop was fucking terrible. I stopped playing after 6 years because of that pandering pile of poop.
---
Nah, the games are just two very different games catering to different people for different reasons.
---
Most guilds will prioritize tank gear to the MT.  BUT they still pay DKP for it.
---
Also a guild would be stupid to give offspeed gear over main spec just because MT.
---
If Ion gets involved it'll be all downhill.
---
They're restoring my hope that Classic WoW won't be a disappointment.
---
I've totally disregarded Blizzard for a long time and nothing they can do will restore any faith. They don't make games that interest me anymore.
---
Why as locks more sought after on alliance?
---
The rep you get from current sources is going to be wrong (over inflated)  
---
But it will give you a good idea of which route to take. Just don't expect to hit exalted by level 40.  
---
Also I can teach you exactly how to create this list if you PM me.  
---
I have done it myself, but my work was kind of shoddy so I don't really want to share it. I'm pretty sure there are things missing lol.  
---
It does well enough for me but if you want it to be totally accurate to your own standard, you'll have to follow my steps from scratch.  
---
Depends on stack size, it might only be 2 if they change it.
---
OP i believe you may be lost.
---
This is a *sub reddit* for a *Blizzard* game. If you were hoping to find anything other than the occasional news repost and a s side of elite-ism mixed with salt, you are mistaken.
---
All dungeons? Oh you mean that 40 people could enter them, but they weren't designed for it?
---
As a DPS warrior there are almost exclusively side grades in MC prior to Rags.
---
Weapons come from Ony, with no competition for Axes you dont have stiff competition.
---
Because you dont get many items, you have a better chance of saving up DKP for "Generic" dps items.
---
Undead female animations are probably the best in the game, second closely by Orc Male.
---
Bfa was not developed in secret. The beta forums were filled with feedback regarding the failures of the Azerite system and very large thread offering suggestions to fix them, as well as the garbage class design.  Then the forums were deleted, and they blamed the players for not providing enough feedback. 
---
Now in their latest q&amp;a they blamed the playerbase again for not providing the proper feedback. The retail wow team has a disease of hubris and is unwilling to admit when they are wrong, then blame their customers for their mistakes.
---
Really happy a compromise was found that worked for many.  Addressed the main concern a lot of people had, while also allowing people to resolve legitimate issues in raids.  The classic hype is real
---
Most is warrior. 
---
Least is arguably hunter for both. PvE your value mostly comes from split-pulls/kiting/tranq-shots and ever doing respectable damage is just icing on the cake. Then in PvP, shenanigans with fd/traps and viper sting can often be just as effective for winning group fights as actually trying to kill targets, and your pet is mostly valuable for how it interrupts casting.
---
For the 7-8 seasons I played, this was always the mentality. "Meta is not in a good state right now." Just for different reasons every time. Originally it was 2-winston, 2-lucio, 2-tracer meta. Then it was the 3-tank meta. Then the 3-tank 3-healer meta. Then dive meta. Then anti-dive meta. I quit around then due to school obligations. 
---
Honestly to me what you're describing is just another step in the road of an evolving game. 
---
lolwat.
---
Here is the takeaway from whoever sees this video and doesn't want to watch it.
---
&gt;"*I don't think its completely out of the scope of reality to see a 5k seal of command proc!"*
---
-Ret Paladin who's never played Vanilla.
---
Shit man, even If they give feedback that I may not agree with (not saying that is the case)... it's still feels like an open channel of communication. 
---
It's crazy to see the shit on reddit go on and then all of a sudden there's a blue post with a good compromise of the two view points. That's just the most recent ezample. Solid team they got over there working on classic wow for us old farts. 
---
Thanks blizzard classic team. 
---
Was it not a private server with accelerated leveling?
---
To those that don't know, Jeff used to be on the Classic team.
---
[Here's a presentation he did on WoW Raid design back in 2005.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Falm0H7VEiQ) The man knows his stuff - he's a good dev in whatever department they throw him in. 
---
For me pandas was the symbol for "we're out of ideas" they put one panda in the orc campaign of the frozen throne expac for war3 as a character that was a total joke.  Next thing you know it's a playable race and totally part of warcraft lore?  Don't think so, i cancelled my sub the day MoP was announced and I don't feel as if i missed anything.  Then i played Legion for less than 2 months cause it was a "good" expac and i knew i didn't miss anything.  
---
Beta is still far too late to scrap a core game system like that. 
---
Don’t miss out on Horde, it’s really a great leveling experience. The Barrens especially. You’ll go from loving to be out of the newbie zone, to hating it, to missing it when you finally leave around 20-21. 1K Needles is kind of like that too, so they’re both pretty memorable. 
---
"BFA" is also a popular acronym. It has almost nothing to do with WoW: BFA when you google it. 
---
Not the question but we appreciate the input.

So much mithril mining for azuras star gem I think it was.
---
This is also true. They recently announced the removal of a bunch of portals. To force more people to either A: interact with mages or B: actually go out into the world and travel. That would be a praised decision on this subreddit.
---
It was met with Diablo Immortal levels of resentment in the WoW community. WoW is a different game now with different players who want different things than we did back in Vanilla. Thats why we all quit, but it doesn't mean what they're doing is wrong.

You are in for a treat, my good sir
---
You could also argue that for hunters, since they have the worst scaling in the game from gear, that in a way they are the least reliant on gear. Especially if playing BM since pets get no benefit from gear. 
---
Yeah, that's why I played two horde characters to 60 on a private server. In addition to that I played healers which I had never done before.  
---
It was the most formative decision I made for Classic because I learned that I don't want to be horde, and I am god awful at healing.  
---
I have more confidence about my faction/race/class choice now than I ever had before.
---
Lots of banks nowadays will allow you to customize your card so you could do this now
---
This is 100% true when I said mages are better I mean this. Mage is a T1 pvp class while leveling, it's one as a fresh 60 and it's one in God gear. At no point is a mage not a T1 pvp class. Warlock on the other hand sucks until you get gear like a warrior.
---
To be clear the pay off is their for a warlock. It's just many moons away from start. Where as a mage is T1 from day one and never looks back. 
---
I'd actually agree with him that hunter is the least. Yes, every class is gear dependent, but since hunters are the worst scaling class in the game from gear, they are arguably the least gear dependent. The difference between a tier .5 hunter and a tier 1-2 hunter is big, but the difference between a tier .5 warlock and a tier 1-2 warlock is waaay bigger.
---
I ***highly*** doubt that right-click report and automated reports will ever go away. This is a feature in literally every single modern Blizzard game - it's just how they operate, it helps ease the Customer Service load, which is the whole reason raid lootsharing is going to be a thing in the first place. 
---
That sounds like an asshole not a hardcore gamer. A person who knows the game usually likes to help out and try to give possitive feedback, not bash players.
---
I've always played Alliance as well, and I'd love to try Horde... but I just want to be a Dwarf Priest! Dilemmas... 
---
Because ally locks are weaker in PvP due to the prevalence of UD with Will of the Forsaken, so more Lock players roll horde 
---
Sort of. As an avid OSRS player, I can tell you that the game has gone in a completely new direction from the parent game. The quests have different finales, and there are bosses that are completely new from the ground up.
---
It would be like Blizzard adding a raid that current retail players would literally never see in their version of the game.
---
BFA was absolutely developed in secret, as was every other expansion. Betas are not areas where major game-wide changes take place, they are for tuning and bug fixes. BFA was in development for years before it was announced, they plan these things will in advance. 
---
Blizzard are not going to remove or drastically change the Azerite system months before launch, the development timelines are stretched thin as it is. Its a flawed system that they make worse by undoing all their previous work in favour of new, shiny features to print on advertisements.
---
Audioslave for me, I'll be listening to a mix of Audioslave, Avril Lavigne, Evanescence, and Nightwish. Those were THE iconic bands for me when I was playing originally.
---
*cries in paladin*
---
The problems that people have with the portals isn't that some were removed, it's the ones that they decided to remove. 
---
generally if im melee i go male and caster go female
---
though exceptions as of late as ive found it a interesting change to go female horde as i feel like 95% horde is males
---
Yeah, 40 people could enter all the 5 mans.  The private server meta would be to run 40 man BRD, LBRS, UBRS, STRAT, SCHOLO in ten minutes.  Up until patch 1.3.
---
That is still a downgrade from "what they can and cannot play" to "this guy bitches a lot".
---
anyone below 6ft is a gnome irl tbh
---
Oh! Thanks for the information. What a neat little detail to pay homage to the original. 
---
That's the answer, and should clear up any confusion. 
---
same it always was a silly argument to me
---
i just want a different set of animations and to not look so silly as a paladin in a dress
---
On private servers I found that I could get two resurrections by creating a stone and using it before logging out, then creating and not using another one upon logging in. This made the leveling experience a bit more permissive. Did this also work historically, or is it an exploit unlikely to work on classic content?
---
My point wasn't that locks are bad. Or that there are no situations where they might be better. What I am trying to say. Is a Mage is T1 at everything always and, pays nothing for it. The class is always T1 at everything. Maybe not always the best but always T1. Mages also pay nothing for it. No onerous soul shards, no ammo, you start out with the hit you need to raid for free.
---
Basically what I am saying is a mage is like the stereo typical type A older sibling on TV. Who always Excels at everything and never seems to have to work or sacrifice for it. They just get it all. Warlocks are like they kid sibling. Goth as fuck eye shadow on. Making sarcastic comments about then chosen child and what not. 
---
My point isn't that a Lock never catches up. Or that it can't do anything it's a great class. However at the end of the day the lock. Is always going to be the younger sibling going "Marsha, Marsha, Marsha" Because at the end of the day the warlock is always mad the mage gets handed everything for free. While they have to work their fingers to the bone for it.
---
That's why I said they fit the class fantasy of one who sold their soul. A mage plays like a tricky caster. The lock plays like a dude that sold they soul for power. 
---
You deserve this happening to you if you don't have Master Loot on with pugs in the raid.
---
Cheers.
---
Heh that’s not super bad when games take 10 minutes on private servers. Try Silverwing or  League of Arathor.
---
Generally fire spells are basically unused later in leveling. Especially with Shadow Mastery (increases shadow damage talent) your shadow spells have much better damage per mana. If you've got a fire itch I'd go with fire mage.
---
100% in agreement. Titanforging and RNG is the single largest problem with retail, and has been for 2 expansions.
---
I hate to be the spoilsport here, but there is very little reason why an enh shaman should get priority over warriors on any twohanded weapon that isn't nightfall, as that's what any raiding enh shaman should be using full-time. Would that sweet twohander be more beneficial to him outside of raiding compared to warriors? Perhaps so, but that has no bearing on how loot should be distributed for the overall improvement of the raid. If the guild is nice, they probably should let the enh shaman get sulfuras since warriors can get better and relatively easier-to-obtain alternatives (BRE, UTB, Ashkandi, and so on), but again there is no factual argument how giving sulfuras to an enh shaman instead of a warrior would benefit the raid more - neither are likely going to use it, UNLESS the warrior raids as 2h fury, which is viable on horde and certainly better than a non-nightfall-wielding enh shaman.
---
I played in a guild that gave sulfuras to their enh shaman and let him use it over nightfall while raiding, as a result he consistently did less dps than the tanks and - from a numbers perspective - was a complete waste of a raid spot. Great personality though!
---
&gt; What percentage of people who played Vanilla for the first time on private servers quit before level 6?
---
You're comparing two very different things. One has the player making a passive choice to continue playing. The other has the player making an *active* choice to continue playing. 
---
Right click report is fine, it's the auto-silence that is the problem.
---
I just want to throw this out there because I don't know if it's been mentioned and I can't be bothered to look for myself.
---
The WoW forum etc community has always been a dumpster fire. This isn't new. In-game people mind themselves. The forums are where people with very strong opinions and the trolls that like to stir them up go.
---
I've also enjoyed the irony of a "community" that holds "community" to some sort of golden standard while being the exact opposite of what they preach, but that's really only a forum thing and not an in-game thing in my experience in both vanilla and on pservers.
---
To be honest, people just didn't know how good they had it. They didn't complain because those metas were awful, they complained because the metas got stale and were "figured out".
---
The CC Brigitte meta was *easily* the worst.
---
Sorry mages best for least gear dependent for most as mage I aoe grinded to level 60 using crescent staff, you get it at level 18, lmao I also wrote an aoe boost multibox guide for a mage to level another character to 60 in a couple days. Best money farm dungeon pvp class imho any questions feel free to ask me
---
I tried switching factions on several private servers over the last couple years. I found the people on the opposite faction to be shitty. They helped me less in contested zones. More people fostered ideas from the Retail game, like I literally had to defend myself in Trade chat for rolling on Cloth in a lvl 35 dungeon as a Druid. Way too many kids, girls, and half the people had stupid ass names you just know theyre not the kind of people you want to be around constantly.
---
I have 1-8 bound to those.  My fingers know it, let's see if my brain does:
---
1 = skull
---
2 = X
---
3 = star
---
4 = moon
---
5 = triangle
---
6 = circle
---
7 = square
---
8 = diamond
---
Yeah, I do!  Anyway, one thing I like to do is cycle back and forth between X and Skull as the kill target.  Focus skull, X is next.  If we're on X, skull is next.
---
Oh, hot damn. I was just thinking about some of the old WoW podcasts I used to listen to, including his. 
---
Pserver yes because theres no other way to get data, accelerated leveling? No it was 1x with vanilla quest exp. Only thing you can argue is accelerated is actually rested exp being twice as fast(dunno why that shit isn't fixed), but tbh pretty much leveled the char without sleeping :D
---
*Turns sideways and inserts*
---
I've never understood the people who thought this was weird. Playing a character that is not your gender isn't weird. It isn't some deep insight into your own sexuality and insecurities and desires or whatever. You don't even have to justify it with weak bullshit like "lel wud i rather look at girl butt or boy butt wile i lvl".
---
I'm not even going to get into the intentionally exaggerated sexual dimorphism in WoW that appeals to our utterly base instincts and how that might influence character choice.
---
A dude playing a female character or ice versa is no weirder than playing an elf, cow person, zombie, a tusked furry elf, etc. It isn't any weirder than a male author writing a female protagonist.
---
Manlets BTFO
---
Normalizing buffs is what finally got me. I went from full Heroic ICC gear with the highest Demo lock SP buff on the server, to hearing about how Ele Shamans we're going to get my buff on one of their totems, I was pissed at Blizzard. Trudged through Cata like a zombie and finally quit after hearing about Kung Fu Panda.
---
Most people don't try to justify it. They roll their character and don't care what internet strangers think of their choice in pixel shapes and casting animations lol
---
As a combustion firemage I would dominate the brackets and wpvp with CDs up I only lost to warlocks rarely mages are fucking insane for utility and with gear gg... Combustion mage+conflag warlock=annhilation got 250 world kills in a couple hours only dieing once haha 
---
I think there are a lot of reasons people feel differently about this. Some people's characters fill some sort of self-insert role, so playing the opposite gender seems counterintuitive and weird. Some people pick based on what tickles their pickle so the opposite gender is chosen (or whichever they're into I guess?).
---
But I'm fairly certain most people don't care about this nearly as much about which has the least dorky animations.
---
I still wondering why ppl, and most people here atleast 25+ years old, so dump, it will be abused almost every pug raid, almost everybody, you even can't realize how shit people around you. Why you still wear pink tinted goggles? 
---
And If you know weapon that will be used against you you can prepare. 
---
Many thanks op, literally most useful post here. 
---
Except for starcraft! Sure diehard Broodwar fans hate on sc2 but lots of people love 2 and consider the most recent expansion to be the most fun sc2 has been. 
---
For Horde players you can get the Branding Rod from the barrens, 21.6 DPS (almost as good as Cookie's). The quest chain only requires level 10 (collecting Plainstrider Beaks). The last quest is tough, you have to kill a level 27 near Ratchet. I was barely able to solo this on a Priest with a potion at level 19 but you could probably grab a few friends around 15 to 16 to knock it out. 
---
Man did you play any of the warcraft games? It wasnt super gritty or realistic but it certainly had adult themes and dark storylines 
---
I agree except in the case of Raptor / Tiger mounts - I don't think anyone is naive enough to have faith in a random ML, and would be expecting it to be set to a normal roll system on the pull.
---
It was on thottbot iirc
---
I'm a diehard starcraft fan myself and unfortunately the writing for the campaign took a massive hit in Heart of the Swarm/Legacy of the Void. The genius writing of Brood War overshadowed Wings of Liberty by a bit, but for all purposes that game was great. It was the most popular video game from 2010-2011 and was the king of twitch.tv for almost two years. Blizzard didn't really listen to fans though which caused the casual playerbase to switch to things like league of legends, dota 2, etc.
---
Brood War remaster was unbelievable though. They hit it out of the park with that one, and now Brood War is almost more popular than Sc2. It's crazy.
---
There is DR in the video, that's why he uses sap and blind, to reset stun DR.
---
I don't know man the 3tank/3heal meta was so bad that people would straight up make agreements not to play it. This was back when Zen, Mercy, Lucio, and Symmetra were the only people classified as Support. Whole roster of amazing DPS heroes (and they kept adding more) and playing any of them would get you flamed. 
---
I can't understand how blizz made so crap ne male model literally all of their animations looks stupidly dumb, also human caster have silly animations too, but melee looks good. 
---
They could probably add a maximum number you can have in inventory. I'm on the fence too, it would be reeaaally nice but the implications are problematic.
---
If 39 people help you complete something you wouldn’t have been able to do without them, you better give them 95% of the stuff. 
---
I did enjoy the starcraft campaign but am primarily a mutliplayer guy
---
You put the nail on the head here. It really is that simple. 
---
Can't vouch for anyone else but I am against "casuals" as it is often used as a shield / excuse for being so terrible that they make the game impossible to play with, and boring to play against.
---

I'll be doing horde cause I've already seen alliance on private server 
---
I thought you were gonna say ebola.
---
I’m pretty sure wow classic comes with the sub. You also now get every previous expansion besides the current one for having a sub.
---
Honestly kind of bummed was looking forward to abusing the system and the upcomming rants on here about it. 
---
Now all we need is sharding gone and i dont think there will be much more complaining. 
---
Well the issue was the 3 most important portals a mage can't provide. Karazhan was the only way for Horde to get to southern Eastern Kingdoms easily. Dalaran Crater was the only (easy) way for Alliance to get to northern Eastern Kingdoms (there is a portal but it's not learned off a trainer, but rather a limited quantity tome sold by a vendor once you get an item in Scarlet Monastery) and Caverns of Time has no portal equivalent for either faction and Blizzard even conceded this point and decided to add it back in the last Q&amp;A.
---
Depends who does the asking. 
---
If the group is admin for 1 more for their run that 1 deserves something. 
---
If you're asking for 39 people to carry you through a raid that's gonna cost you. 
---
A shield and fury spec is all you need to tank UBRS. 
---
How many patches before everything is personal loot like current WoW?
---
Honestly. It's investors that causes the harm. If you rely on investors that have odd demands and you're forced to cater to it, that's not a good thing. 
---
If they say: we need underthingy because he’s the only warrior on the server with the necessary frost resistance, then sure. Absolutely. 
---
If they spam Ironforge saying they have 3 open DPS spots for MC, then no. You’re an equal at best, slightly less than an equal in reality. 
---
EDIT 3/23/2019: Alright boys and girls! Looks like I made some good progress after some research here. I used Noggit Qt 3.2614 which requires WoW WotLK client 3.3.5a which allows 3d and 2d (toggle tile) rendering with areaID painting. I had to overlay manually so it isn't 100% exact, but we sure are close. It's interesting to see that all the sub-zones are little squares in different shapes.  Check this out!: [https://imgur.com/a/QJ5Vdty](https://imgur.com/a/QJ5Vdty)
---
We’re still doing these posts huh? 
---
I only feel this way for the classic team specifically.
---
I still don’t get why loot trading has to be in the game at all. It was a feature released two expansions later. Makes no sense on why they want to include it.
---
And yet if no-one responds to them they don't do their raid. 
---
It definitely got dumbed down in expansions, giving multiple classes easy panic buttons, and generally simplifying aggro / threat and tanking.
---
 A proper group will have no problem, but... that's the problem lol.
---
You'll find even low level dungeons can pose a risk if the tank doesn't have good multitasking - or is absent minded allowing the healer to draw aggro on 2+ mobs could mean death.
---
Cc is your best friend, and dps breaking CC is your worst enemy.
---
Overall, tab targetting, spamming sunders, thunderclap when excess rage / demo shout, and taunting the instant you lose aggro, that's all there is to it.
---
The difference lies with the community. On regular PvP servers players tend to focus much more on mix maxing and the competitive aspect of the game. On RpPvP servers players take more time for the game and enjoy things like and atmossphere a lot more. And there is also rp which I personally care about.
---
Finding Rp players on regular PvP servers will be a lot more difficult and the chance of people trolling is a lot higher. Rpers are often looked down upon by other players for some reason which is why it is best to have seperate realms for Rpers, both RpPvE and RpPvP
---
The reason why Rpers are on Moonguard is because it was initially labeled Rp, if it wouldn't have been labeled that, there would be pretty much no Rpers. Rpers will flock to Rp servers (duh), not providing both types of them is a big mistake.
---
And yes, it will ruin my experience, I used to play on a RpPvP server and want to relive that experience. That is not quite possible on regular PvP servers. How would you feel if your favorite type of server would not be available?
---
I had a dream last night that I played a gnome mage.. maybe it’s a sign of what I should roll haha
---
I think Legion's success is a testament to how important time spent is for a product. IIRC they started Legion around halfway WOD and it really shows. BfA is rushed, was released 8-9 months after announcement and nowhere is it felt more than the failed azerite system.
---
You're wrong
---
Tanking is as hard as the tank makes it
---
Knowledge and group set up are key 
---
I am fine with both tbh. 
---
However, I would like a system like artifact weapons but permanent. (which were pretty much old talent system disguised in weapons). Artifacts felt cool, impactful and powerful. Both the Azerite and the shitty talents they implemented since MoP SUCKS.
---
No way! That is awesome!
---
When Classic was first announced, I was working night shifts. I relistened to all the Instance episodes that were released during vanilla while at work. It was awesome and really got me into the mood for Classic.
---
If anyone wants to give it a go: 
---
http://frogpants.plig.net/old_instance/
---
Not too many more times, I reckon.
---
Wouldn't have thought people would min max that hard haha, guess my choice for ally lock is going to work out
---
It sucks for casters. Agreed. But I don't get your point. Ten level 44's are absolutely going to be a challenge for a level 60.
---
When I was leveling up a Druid, I would jump in on PvP battles. The best way for me to help was usually just root something in place, let the mages and hunters get the kill, then throw them an Innervate after so they can get back to grinding. (They love me for that, by the way. That Innervate 100% guarantees that they will come to my defense whenever I need it. But that's another topic...)
---
If we were fighting a ?? target, though? I didn't even try to cast spells on him. I just stood back and healed anyone who needed it. If I needed to do damage, then I was better off going in Bear Form and hitting him with melee attacks rather than casting spells on him.
---
Prove it.
---
This would be nice, I admit. And a nice post.
---
Although it would be a massive change, it would require custom new honor system changes never seen before and as I see it, it has virtually 0 chance of being implemented.
---
Use your mouse to move
---
&gt; Yes it is expected by disagreeing with something   
---
&gt; you are inheritly saying there is something better to replace that 
---
Sorry but logic how from the first position follows the second must be proved. Otherwise it’s just an expression you took out of your head because it suits you right now, but until it is proven, unfortunately it has no value.
---
&gt;  If you don't have any idea on how to solve the problem sharding is fixing then don't complain 
---
 can i decide for myself what i should do? Thanks. Eventually we are on subreddit dedicated to RPG. And seriously, stop trying to separate me from the rest, shame me or give me some properties just to get away from a direct answer.
---
This.

Warcraft 3 was great and made me fall in love with the Warcraft universe. Classic was the best way to explore the world Warcraft 3 has created. Hence the name World of Warcraft. With each expansion they moved away more and more from the original Warcraft which is the main reason I quit. Modern day WoW is just not the Warcraft I started to love in Warcraft 3. Classic, however, is the best version to enjoy the Warcraft universe as it is based on the original Warcraft games and RpPvP servers are the only one that deliver the whole package. I want to Rp with other players, enjoy the lore and immerse myself in the game as well as have the great open world dynamic that only pvp servers can provide.
---
Brilliant. This is the hunter we need. Forget the established or even intended meta. This man finds a way to complete the mission no matter what. 
---
that isn't true in classic. 
---
raids are 40 man but realistically are balanced around a much smaller amount of people actually doing the mechanics to score boss kills. 
---
smaller groups have to be pickier but 40 man raids were balanced around 10-15 people being vaguely conscious bodies until you hit the content where hard dps and healing checks started coming into play and by the time you hit those bosses, you'd likely have a committed group and wouldn't bother needing to PuG slots (especially Naxx which had pretty grueling costs or grinds associated with attunement that'd bar most people from even being able to enter the raid)
---
Exactly. It’s all blueprinted and the only thing they need to do is exactly replicate what has been done, and with any changes just stick to the design pattern
---
The replies on this post have opened my eyes about this fact: it really did suck to be a caster against a ?? enemy. Although melee had it better, they still missed more often then hit so it's still an issue. I really hope that blizzard takes a good hard look at the original way spell hit was calculated when it came to level difference and restore that to classic... but I'm not holding my breath. 
---
Clarifications
---
1) ?? is 10 levels above
---
2) (directed at OP but I don't want to make a second comment) grey is an amount below your level that changes with level.  At 60 I believe it's 10 levels.

You.... think this game's graphics didn't age well? Seriously? It's going on 16 years and I'd say it's *damn* well aged comparatively. 
---
The version where NPCs pose a threat, is the version where people would die on offense more easily. When they die on offense, before they've had time to cap a GY, they get pushed back into their own base. When they get pushed back into their own base, the only way back to the enemy base is through the enemy's offense, thus PvP. 
---
Most of it is pretty easy and can be done fury with shield.  Drak and Beast hit like trucks on blue gear though... you will need to be defense capped.  If you're worried then just 3heal it instead of 2 and take the extra time.
---
It should be fine.
---
Shamans do not need much SP. You will get a spellpower weapon from raiding (because there's hardly any only healing), you will get tier gear which often has spellpower(especially 2.5 which is retardedly strong), and so on. I've done it myself.
---
That's because it's physical, rogues got no problem applying cheap shot or kidney shot either.
---
stfu retail kiddy
---
just look at that post on UBRS loot trading. You got 90% people praising it, but then you see the "wow, Blizzard, really going to let people tell you how to make YOUR game? should have stuck to your guts." Blizzard has to make these decisions because we the people are stupid.

remaking azeroth so that flying mounts could be used. after saying that would never happen. was that beginning of the end for retail wow imo
---
fact you could now get to level 15 and just sit in a city and run dungeon finder till your a bit away from max. making all these convenient changes killed any gameplay. when I returned to see world pop has pretty much been deleted I couldn't believe my eyes.
---
Well it depends greatly on your spec. Princess is a fight where you can't spend a lot of time in melee range, so you can actually spec Subtlety for combo point generation and rely on Eviscerate damage but that's kinda wonky since Subtlety is otherwise not a great PvE spec.
---
Leveling my shaman while playing thunderstruck by Ac/DC  1-60!
---
Come on guys... The game doesn't even have a release date. How about we wait until the game has been running for a while. 
---
Even then, rereleasing a game made a decade ago shouldn't make anyone feel confident about Blizzard's direction. Don't forget, they appear to have their focus for the future on mobile games. This release trend for their old stuff is cash grabs with high profit margins and to hide the fact they aren't releasing anything new worth a damn.
---
Might as well throw the whole chair away 
---
I played Alliance probably as much as anyone else.  I don't mean that as a saying, I mean I was probably in the 0.01% of /played, and it was all with my human warrior.  I have started warming up with launch playing horde, and it is like realizing their were words on the back of the pages of the book you were reading.  I have learned so much and enjoy the game so much more for the time on the other side

"Rockpounder Reserved"
---
2.0.3 was live a week before TBC launched - wtf are you smoking? Patch 2.0.1 (which is the patch that added summon stone functionality, which I think is what you are referring too) came 40 days before the launch of TBC as it's pre patch. 
---
1.12 was live for 3 months.
---
And raise the level cap to 70.
---
in my experiences with raiding in classic back in the day,
---
if you show up as a PuG to a guild's raid as a regular, they'll likely just invite you to the guild or have you on their spreadsheets for loot decisions
---
if you show up to a guild's raid one raid out of the 2-3 they'll likely do a week, they'll reward people who show up to every raid over you, maybe sometimes throwing you a bone if nobody in their core group needs it. sometimes they'd have you on the spreadsheets, other times you were that guy who sometimes filled a spot when they needed it
---
there's a reason systems like DKP were popular in classic, they incentivized showing up and allowed guilds to gear up their regulars who likely drove progress anyways.
---
when you get 2 drops for every boss kill, that's the only gearing system that makes sense. 
---
again, in my experiences with classic raiding, 
---
for progress, you typically funneled gear to your main tanks (who likely had to have perfect attendance to even be considered for the position and likely also filled leadership roles within the guild to some degree) and you prioritized the DPS and healers who showed up regularly

Well, kind of easily preventable by not traveling to certain countries.
---
They will be linked as that's 1.12.
---
You can still farm it VERY easily and the gold farm is overpowered.
---
Tribute farm is possible and very easy in 1.12 vanilla, so unless if blizzard nerfs it somehow, then it will be possible.
---
I'd been using Rammstein all the way :)
---
Hey! Yes, we do
---
Also worth a read [here's a forum post he made as a player back in the EQ days.](https://i.imgur.com/NsBc8hB.png)
---
When Blizzard killed 1k needles in Cata I cried lol
---
Wall walk exploration stands out in my mind as one of the most prominent good memories from vanilla.  
---
I had so much fun doing that and teaching others.  
---
I guess we can thank buggy/uncompleted EQ raids for WoW's awesome raids?
---
Why wouldn't you have faith in the company that created WoW? Makes no sense. It's not like the recent expansions are bad games even if you didn't like the direction, they're still incredibly complex and require talented people to make.
---
One of the large announcement's I am anticipating is some word on how they will handle Battlegrounds, Cross realm or no. Would be interesting to know their perspective on server community/queue times.
---
Slap a quiver on and you’ll do more dps with a wand than with spells some levels.
---
2 abilities being able to land on same time.
---
So being able to vanish abilties, being able to frostbolt+CoC a mob that's nova'd and get double shatter proc, being able to gouge a mage as rogue at same time as he blinks  etc.
---
I've played on like 5 different private server launches, a lot of them done quite well but sharding is way way way better for a launch. It's a necessary evil... But ofc it's risky because blizzard might think of using it again later.
---
Are we at the point soon where we can stop thinking that the classic team is not our friends? Or do people wanna keep crying? 
---
That's a private server bug. Won't be the way on retail.
---
&gt;Personally, I want the option to report someone via right-click to exist. I think that's a fantastic change. If someone is being a massive fuckwit to the point they need reporting, then there should be as little time and barrier between the victim(s) and reporting the behavior as is possible.
---
Just putting them on ignore solves 99% of these issues, one click and its done. Never understood the mao-ism in gaming culture of fucking reporting everyone you dislike, I find it quite troubling honestly.
---
Someone said a naughty word? Just ignore them, as easy as that, and you can see them on your ignore list so you never have to play with them again.
---
And on the other hand, right-click report will just end up being abused to oblivion and report EVERYONE who ganks you in STV or wherever.
---
I think that use to be one back in the day and they ended up changing it to &lt;Murlocs Stole My Socks&gt;
---
&gt;Nah, I've always liked being able to easily report racists etc.
---
Why not just ignore them?
---
If it's raining here now, then it was raining on the West Coast this morning.

If it's raining now, then your laundry is getting wet.

If it's raining now, there will be mushrooms to be picked next week.

If he locked the door, then Kitty is trapped inside.
---
In most dungeons there are a couple tricky pulls like the room with a lot of stairs in SFK which can easily wipe a group if the patrol links two groups together.
---
But once you know the more difficult parts, you have mastered the most important aspect of dungeon tanking: dungeon knowledge. 
---
The rest you get familiar with when reading guides and playing your warrior.   
---
Enjoy!
---
Then make an RPPvP server for all RP. Problem solved 
---
Yes, OSRS route is much better than doing EVERY expansion.
---
The game goes downhill the second TBC is launched, and the nail is in the coffin when Wrath is out.
---
You can think of shards as a multitude of servers that get merged once you're out of the starting zone!
---
A lot of people I’ve debated with on this issue in the sub are now praising Blizzard for their brilliant decision of fixing loot trading when just yesterday they were telling me they saw no problem with loot trading and that it was actually a good addition to the game.
---
For fucks sake when this sub first got made I remember seeing comments unironically about how Blood Elves should be added because “it’s just a skin”. 
---
Unbelievable, the hype is through the roof for me!
---
If the people who don’t want us to complain won out, we’d never have Classic to begin with. That’s how you can tell someone whose really been part of the community over a r/WoW tourist who just two years ago laughed in our faces and said Classic would never happen.
---
6/10
---
It was master loot, doesn't change the fact that everyone can still roll on thing they don't need while making the master looter think they need it.
---
The only reason to play Horde is to play Shaman - which is legitimately one of the most fun classes in the game. I don't regret my time playing Shaman and I've grown to like Horde much more than I like Alliance. If you do not plan on playing a Shaman in Classic, however, then I recommend playing Alliance for one reason: Paladins. It's not even that Paladins are overpowered (they're not), but they give your groups so much more flexibility.
---
Consider an Alliance 10-man WSG pre-made. You can have a Priest healing, a Paladin healing, and a Druid off-healing while running flags. That gives you 2 defensive dispels from your dedicated healers and plenty of flexiblity to get the best damage dealers that you can find. Shadow Priests and Ret Paladins are perfectly fine choices for this group as they can help stack those defensive dispels.
---
Now consider the Horde version. You start with a Priest healer and a Druid off-healer who runs the flag. Now you need to find another defensive dispel - but Resto Shaman don't have it. You still want a Shaman, but you want that Shaman to play an offensive hybrid role, either as Elemental or Enhancement. That forces you to have Priests and only Priests are your primary healers in PvP. You're generally unable to fit Shadow Priests into a Horde premade because you're already forced to run 2-3 healing Priests just to stay competitive.
---
TLDR: Shaman are the better class, but *not having Paladins* is worse than having Shaman. Roll Alliance if you want the full Classic experience.
---
He absolutely does, just read his comments. He’s not speaking in hypotheticals here.  A “well written” response to this would lean towards towards the problem without bragging about the amount of gold he from practicing these scumbag techniques.
---
I never saw anything reserved except the head on onyxia pug. Why join a pug with reserved items when you can find one without easily ?
---
This is exactly what happens when you have a developer with a team under extreme constraints by the publisher and a offshoot team that is doing a side project that has little interference from the publisher.
---
Classic doesn't have to reach a certian audience, or be profitable, or necessarily meet internal deadlines. It's a free addon to the base game that needs developer freedom to explore how to do it right, because the goal is to create a dual game that appeals to older and more modern MMO players. 
---
If we had publishers that appreciated this and were more hands-off we would see better MMORPGs being made.
---
Next topic: Sharding
---
I leveled so many horde over the years I’m sick of the barrens. Going alliance this time for a fresh feel since I haven’t played one since early classic. And help slow down burnout. 
---
So because blizzard decided to make a shit loot system we should all stop pugging?
---
Don’t a lot of credit card companies let you personalize cards? Should totally make one like this!
---
The creditcard that gives you 1 minute of gametime per 1$ spent. So, if you spent 500$ during a month, you'd get 8 hours.  Quite pointless.
---
BTW I had it approved
---
Spoiler alert: server dies
---
Except WoW was more popular than Everquest.
---
I remember doing this in cataclysm as a warlock. I think it only changed when combat rezzes changed
---
I feel like Pandaren's exagerated expressions did not help either. It was the first race with cartoonesque emotes and movements. Older races were more rigid. Perhaps more for technical reasons than artistic, but it made them look more serious, so pandas looked a bit out of place (not the case anymore with the new models).
---
I loved the landscape of Pandaria. If I could change anything, I would just add some Orc/Human/Any old race bases in initial quests to make the "transition". It's okay to do a new just-discovered continent, but if there are callbacks to the old stuff, the world feels more connected. Otherwise you feel like teleporting to another game.
---
IMO the gameplay failures were just the same as Cataclysm, repeated.
---
Haha spot on!
---
For real. If even 500k people come back and resub just to play at 14.99 a month. That's like 7 mil....
---
It's only weird if you make it weird.
---
Not having played on a rp server back in the day doesn't invalidate the desire to do so in Classic.
---
You absolutely can now. I am not sure this was a common option back then though.
---
Nah. WoW died with BC.
---
In my experience pugging wasn’t too common in vanilla, anyways. I never saw much of it until WotLK. True vanilla/TBC was guild progression. WotLK implemented easier raid difficulties which lead to increased pugging. Don’t blame blizzard. Their loot system is fine. For guild progression. 
---
Your wording is a little bit confusing, I know you can only get 1 clear casting buff per cast, but if your arcane explosion hits 2 enemies, is clear casting rolling 2 "10 sided dice" to see if either one rolls that 10% chance? I think this mechanic was less well understood.
---
Majority doesn’t necessarily match up with long time players. While I agree that almost every long time player has quit, the cycling players that match up with their current mushiness model are absolutely in a reduced but still overwhelmingly large force. Subs are down from WOTLK but that’s to be expected with age. I’m actually surprised their numbers are as high as they are.
---
What is your question exactly? Also when you say something is bad or wrong you are inherently saying that there is something better than what is bad or wrong. Otherwise why is it bad? What are you comparing it to? To have bad you need good to compare it to that is how basic logic works... Like I said you can say whatever the hell you want and people are free to ignore you and your opinions because in the end without offering an alternative or a way to fix it your just a complainer.
---
downvoted cuz of than
---
Sorry, the names don't remember ring bells, I suppose it's been too long.
---
Funnily enough my (albeit short) memories of classic are planted firmly in the alliance camp, so I'm thinking of maybe reliving that, I do miss ironforge.
---
Yeah, no rppvp would be a real bummer. The regular pvp servers were too crowded and also too hectic for my taste.
---
Oh well, we'll see I suppose.
---
Is it absurd? I have raided a lot during Vanilla and loot trading in raids where you almost exclusively raid with your guild is a great thing. One is no down time as loot can be distributed while clearing trash and if server crashes you still keep the loot, otherwise it would disappear. I don't know if server crashes are still a thing but in Vanilla it was common.
---
BC was fun, but it was the last good thing. WoW died when Ony/naxx got ported to level 80 content. 
---
Coldb has 3 min cd tho
---
doesnt the kill take too long waiting for cd everytime?
---
Not really, just my faith in the team is pretty strong right now.
---
Doesn't mean they are still able to produce a worthy successor. That is in my opinion their only option right now. 
---
" - All of these tricks were used while wrath was live (with loot trading) by me and my guild to get gold and gear faster so it really work "
---
Damn you made a good job gateing so many morally fucked up people under the same banner. its almost like you deserve an ingame achievement for that
---
Heck no! Specially if you never played horde, man. You'll finally get that a completely new perspective. Should be a pretty cool experience for ya.
---
I mean, it ain't going to be a nostalgia trip. At least for me. If you want a nostalgia trip, you might be disappointed.
---
/e trolls 101 (1-100)
---
organizing by zone and order you encounter them would be nice.
---
I have already tried Horde back then. I'll stay with Alliance, because Night Elf Druids.
---
I'm sure flying could be implemented in a way that doesn't break WPvP, amongst other things. Some sort of restriction could be put on them. 'No Fly Zones' from real life come to mind. Something like that.
---
I don't know how I feel about this. It's possible to do so in poe and I don't feel like it gets horribley abused.
---
Most of the time I report gold sellers. 
---
On the other hand poe is more about pve than pvp. 
---
With intense wpvp coming back I would fear the system on pvp servers to get abused by salty players. 
---
What about those who play on RP servers, because they've heard you can't world PVP at all there?
---
My solution for random items (boe) make then bind on pickup if you use need to get it.  Greed is free4all and is sellable then. Do ninas can sell their boe to the merchant
---
There's already going to be RP realms. RP-PvP realms are not RP realms. They are RP-PvP realms.
---
RP realms are going to have PvP. PvP encounters in the open world will be more meaningful than you knowing full well you'll be ganked the moment you enter a contested zone.
---
I don't know what kind of Roleplaying experience you've got, but from my 10+ odd years Roleplaying, I've never once not had issues when it came to a Roleplaying event and PvP.
---
Horde has better flight paths/portals/zepp &gt; deeprun. Horde has a better layout for questing zones barrens &gt; redridge/wetlands. Racials are better for pvp and have much more frequent use in pve for boosts which is fun to cycle and speeds up leveling a bit. Alliance has overall better quest rewards from dungeons like tunic of westfall/ frost dmg staff from wetlands. Barrens quillboar questline is memorable and at the end you have tons of gems (like 60-100+) which can be turned in for buffs, one is like 15% runspeed. I just liked the zones and pathways through them as horde much more, alliance felt more detailed and less rushed but also more tedious and less smooth. Like the cool but time consuming quest chain after delivering the letters after killing Vancleef.
---
Alliance has more opportunities to heal NPCs that are friendly to them, but quest objectives to the horde. Horde gets the peon aoe spot grind spot in arathi highlands and that's the only one I can remember.
---
Our unique class has banana beams to heal with, your class waves their tardadin hands and makes a glow.
---
I missed the Barrens. You meet a lot of players in that phase. Alliance feels like spread out everywhere.
---
But just my opinion. 
---
Does this mean if i win an item, i'll probably get 5 whispers from people asking to buy the item for gold?
---
I leveled all horde and never even had a lvl 1 ally on a different server, alliance leveling is by far more miserable except for overall more aoe spots.
---
We told you that Blizzard will do Classic servers and you laughed. Well you aren't laughing now.
---
I don't understand why there are both pve and PvP RP servers. If your going to RP and follow the lorr &amp; story development then there is a war going on, right? Shouldn't it all just be rp-pvp...? 
---
I think if you hit need it would ask if you want to BOP the item but this could be a Mandela memory.
---
Got the same issue, but I think I can't resist the Barrens chat.
---
The true og experience. 
---
Blizzard said they don't want to manage 2 MMOs so I'd say it's pretty unlikely for the time being.
---
At the end of the day, they are a corporation. They exist for the sole purpose of generation revenue. Thus you can't have 'faith' or 'trust' in them. At a moment's notice they will throw all that under a bus for a quick buck. It's the reality of the situation. Manage your expectations. The Classic project could be cut tomorrow by Activision and there's not a single thing Blizzard or you or me or anyone could do about it.
---
Retail = socialism 
---
Vanilla = capitalism 
---
I never understood the "this is a great game which is why 90% of people will think it is too hard and quit." Does the appeal to the game not kick in til 40?
---
Played Trolls for all of vanilla, BC and WOTLK. Stopped playing. Started playing on a private server with some friends who played alliance. It felt VERY odd not paying an ugly, gangly and goofy troll but it was still fun. Didn't have the same nostalgic value but it was still neat. 
---
Great choice on Blizzard's side. Shows they listen.
---
I recommend the community remains vocal (but polite) in other perceived concerns.
---
My (only?) remaining issue is the recently announced "nerfed" AV that fails to capture the imagination of that BG. I hope they consider older patches when it took longer to complete the BG. I really enjoyed the freedom I had - from pushing towers, doing side objectives, to straight out mindless fighting in the mid. Never thought it was the BG to zerg through like the premade WSG and AB were.
---
On stormreaver horde wsg at 60 was almost never over 5 minutes, alliance could wait 20 minutes. I like being the underdog.
---
Listen man. I understand. But there WILL be an RP scene on some server that is decided upon by the RP community. I can guarantee that. Slowly word will spread that the RP hub is server `X` and people will congregate to that.
---
\* 
---
Vanilla - The awesome original
---
Burning Crusade - The awesome sequel (flying mounts questionable; the rest damn awesome)
---
Wrath of the Lich King - The conclusion of the trilogy, which took things in a weird direction, but was okay (except screwing up Azjol and Anub'arak), finally got to see Northrend, was okay, but everything could've been much better. WotLK should've been better than Vanilla and TBC combined, but somehow they dropped the ball.
---
Cataclysm - Wtf happened to all the classes?
---
Pandaria - Why? We know that you PANDered to China. But why.
---
Post Pandaria - Lost track of game development.
---
So, if this will happen, why not just release the game with RpPvP servers? So players can avoid the hassle of agreeing on a server and having to deal with trolls that will certainly be more numerous on non Rp servers.
---
Xperl or shadowedunitframes
---
How excited can you be watching thousands of models go afk over a quest item on a respawn of 3 minutes? 50 hours for everyone to get the item? 10 hours if the looted item gives the whole group credit.
---
Wait.
---
In reality:
---
Vanilla - The slow, grindy, buggy base game. But it was new and shiny; communities thrived.
---
TBC - The slightly improved base game with more attunements.
---
WotLK - Epic story driven expansion; the start of the death of gearing and communities.
---
Cata - *same as OP*
---
MoP - the one that let's you see who's willing to complain about everything even if it's a great expansion. Because fuck Pandas for some reason?
---
WoD - Similar to WotLK, except it had no content, and you were in a Garrison rather than a world.
---
:) 
---
Any news about a beta please, even if we don't get one I want to know.
---
I've leveled both on frozen 1.12 private servers. 
---
For horde, it feels like one quest zone leads into another very well, and you can easily quest you way to 60 without having to do mob grinding or dungeon grinding for experience. For Alliance, it feels like there is a lot more pingponging between different zones, and also just straight up gaps where you have to grind mobs or spam dungeons just to level up for the next zone. 
---
So for me the leveling experience was way better on Horde. 
---
I'm pretty sure that horde actually does have more quests in 1.12 than alliance (though this may not have been true for all of Vanilla WoW, but it seems very likely we'll have access to most 1.12 quests in Classic).
---
Private servers jaded the opinions of people on most things. Case in Point: Warlock pet summoning.
---
That and AV probably aren't the last in the line of things pserver players will swear on their mother's graves is wrong/different.
---
If there's not enough demand then that's really it, no? That would be your only option.
---
For a counterpoint, I feel like shit asking for a blessing every 5 minutes in dungeons on pserver right now. I considered making a macro for "BoM/BoW/BoK please" and realized how shitty it must be for the pally :D
---
I leveled 1 to 60 as Alliance on a pserver as a longtime Horde player. It's almost a brand new game. Different ways of travelling around the map, different quests and zones, different benefits and drawbacks, etc.
---
It is amazing how Blizzard managed to create 2 factions that are so incredibly different. Find me an MMO that does that these days... 
---
Thing is, misslooting is super rare, having no refund no transfer no trading nothing system would actually work better.
---
But the demand is clearly big enough as the polls and the outrage on reddit and the forums show. There already even are dedicated RpPvP guilds. It's only Blizzard who ihas been out of touch with their audience for years, who doesn't know what the players want. Also, if there would not be enough demand for actual RpPvP servers there would certainly not be enough players around to form a dedicated Rp scene on a PvP server.
---
For right now, retail wow is still blizzard's golden goose, so they probably won't do an alternate expansion or osrs model because it puts retail at risk. They'll be very careful in that regard and I doubt anyone there has any plans at the moment. Until that changes or the finance guys get on board with classic, I expect nothing much to happen. I think blizzard at this point thinks classic will be big at first and then die down so they're thinking short run pop in cash flow and help retain subscriptions of people who join for new expansions and then leave. They may be right, maybe not, no one really knows, just hopes. Once we get out to phase 6 and they have some numbers and hear what people are saying, a bc server is a good bet. 
---
And as for after that? It probably depends more on wow 9.0. If they shit the bed again with the next X-Pac, Activision will probably start pulling resources away from wow. It will be 20 years old at that point and subs continue to fall. Sucks to think about but definitely a possibility. If retail corrects from BFA and improves (possibly with some good classic design) or if classic pulls ahead of retail (unlikely TBH) then all bets are off. Imo, as cool as alt-wow or osrs sounds, I just don't see them doing it because it would be them giving up on retail. 
---
As Long as PvP-RP servers are up at launch, classic is everything it's supposed to be!
---
meanwhile on pservers my addons alone fill more than 500mb ram LUL
---
I still don't think it is a big problem, as long as the culprits of unwarranted mass-reports get temporary bans after a GM review. People won't do it if it means risking a one weak ban on gametime they already paid for. 
---
“relatively high” so cute 
---
I was just leveling a paladin in modern WoW for the hell of it and it's just really quite shocking how easy it all is. I got to like level 17 in 2 hours wearing full heirlooms. I don't think there was a single instance where I felt in danger of dying and in fact I didn't once have to use a healing ability. Then you look at things like cooking, first aid which existed to aid you in leveling but they are a complete waste of time while leveling in modern WoW. Of course another major issues is that you don't have the class quests, you only get new talents every 15 levels, I'm really looking forward to classic WoW where leveling is an actual challenge and a journey again. 
---
I don't know why you were downvoted, man.  I'm 100% a casual player, and I've never done any raiding at all.  I'd like to get into it this time, now that I'm older, but the idea of jumping in with people in the "hardcore circle" and having them rely on me is a little intimidating.  
---
Why? blizzard are absolutely trash. They've made a good decision to bring back classic, that is it. the rest of the games are collecting dust. 
---
Pandaria felt weird to me because it didn't fill in with the rest of the Azeroth. I don't understand how is it so much different and what's up with sentient pandas coming out of nowhere? It didn't feel like wow at all from lore perspective.
---
PvP was great though.
---
We need to know if we're getting a beta or not. 
---
Good job completely ignoring the whole point of the post
---
We went to a continent that had been separated from the rest of azeroth, not surprising it was different. Especially with it focusing on Monks it was more honor/martial arts themed, along with the mantid of course!
---
Definitely agree on the PvP part though. That was my favourite part of the expansion, just having fun with friends on the walls and in the world. Even went horde on Outland EU (99% Alliance) just so we always had people to fight. 
---
Ignoring is for people you don't like. 
---
Reporting is for people that act against terms of service.
---
Easy as that. 
---
I don't trust blizzard to tie their shoes right but I DO trust their analytics. I guess you could make the argument that their statistics are invalid or out of date, ehhh. I'd REALLY be curious to see the average population of RP-PvP servers back in 2004-2007 because if my memory serves, they were almost all listed as `Low`
---
I don't understand dense people like you. Sharding on starting areas is way better than no sharding. Everyone who moves their rose tinted glasses even just a little will understand that.
---
problem is that it doesnt take 30 minuts of downtime to make a wand. it'll take 45-60 minutes, and will last for not too long.
---
Lesser magic wand is gonna be changed at level 20 for Dusk wand (8-20 levels is about 7 hrs of play), greater magic wand is gonna be changed at level 26 for Excavation Rod (13-26 is about 10 hrs of gameplay), so you sacrifice 1 hr out of 10 hrs. It is 10% of wasted time. not sure if its worth it.
---
Then*
---
Was it weird I read this in the voice of Ricky Bobby? 
---
I still had a 16mb ATI card and 512mb SDRAM on release.
---
I remember the relief of getting quests that invovled caves, because there wasn't too much to render inside them and my fps would nearly hit 20!
---
Is it weird to play a character not your species? :)
---
"The world feels bigger if there is unbeaten content" Jeffrey Kaplan 2005.
---
This is the most true phrase about WoW and casual playstyle. When WoW launched, I played it very casually, never achieved max level, yet I had the most fun in MMOs while playing casually.
---
If I would play modern WoW casually I would be bored to death because I can see all the content with one click and it feels super meaningless.
---
I don't think Classic is bad for a casual playstyle at all. You may not clear all the raids but the content you can do feels more meaningful and rewarding than in every following expansion.
---
I want to know if they will drop sharding at some point, I understand that there will be thousands of people at launch and they need to handle it but I hope it’s going to be only for lunch.
---
On that matter blizz are a bit vague and I am a bit worried so if they can give us more detailed information about sharding it will be great.
---
TBC is the best expansion. 
---
Well, this can be explained very easily.
---
First of all, there were no RpPvP realms back in 2004. They were first released in late 2005. So the different communities was already established on the regular servers. It might have been very different if RpPvP would have been around from launch. If Blizz doesn't release RpPvP servers at launch the same thing might repeat. People don't want to reroll or have to transfer their character. Releasing one per region is the best way to gauge interest.
---
Also we are talking about Classic here. The polls regarding Classic, clearly show that the interest in RpPvP is higher than in regular Rp and some polls even show that RpPvP is more popular than straight up PvE servers.
---
These are facts
---
Ugly zone tho
---
dunno.. to me its tbc good, wrath good, cata good, mop good, wod bad, legion bad, bfa bad
---
well losing 3m subs during the entirety of expansion isnt as bad as losing 5m subs in half a year like wod
---
Except thats not how it works in practice. People spam report for everything they don't like, its how it is and how its always been.
---
I played Horde on Defias Brotherhood as well and our guild, everyone I met in game was amazing. We had a lot RP moments with Alliance guilds and other Horde guilds.
---
Blizzard typically announce the exact release date of a wow xpac 2-3 months before release. They typically announce the xpac 12 months before release. Given Classic will have been announced 19+ months before rerelease this may affect timings. Either way, if it were to be May release we would have heard by now and May is spring so I would rule that out. Also start ruling out early June if it’s not announced over the next few weeks.
---
I severely doubt that.
---
i think MoP class design was great, but i think the best one would be a mixture of wrath/cata/mop
---
some classes/specs were better in wrath, some in cata and some in mop.. also getting something from all 3 expansions for each class would be preferable
---
What a genuinely **dumb** post given that we have absolutely zero information so far about a release date.
---
Thank you for your contribution, I guess you should comment the same thing on every other post that we have limited information for :) 
---
Let's pretend arenas were in Classic. You're fighting another class in a duel in one of the BC arenas. All 1v1:
---
*S-Tier*
---
* **Druid** \- The alpha male in PvP. They eat people alive in world PvP. In BG's, they run flags, they defend bases, and they can even tank the end boss in AV. They are the most essential PvP class in the game.
---
* **Rogue** \- The long-time classic. Being able to pick and choose your battles in world PvP (thanks to stealth) is not to be underestimated. While their role is much more narrow than Druids ("hey I do damage!!!!"), they have plenty of utility and CC that is specific to PvP, which is what takes them to the top tier.
---
* **Shaman** \- No stealth necessary when you are a walking cannon. Elemental Shaman wearing a shield can have more armor than an Arms Warrior, plus Lightning Bolts that hit as hard as Frostbolt yet with a 20% faster cast time. The best part: They don't even need to cast thanks to shocks. And Purge makes any magic-using class (particularly Druids and Priests) cry. Well-played Shaman are not fun to fight against, either 1v1 or in an organized group.
---
*A-Tier*
---
* **Warlock** \- You really can't go wrong here. Soul Link is tough to kill 1v1. It's also tough to kill *other* people, but PvP is all about survivability and longevity. Life Tap and high mana costs on spells are unfortunate downsides that prevent them from reaching S-tier. On the bright side: Curse of Tongues completely invalidates Shaman. Keep this up at all times against Shaman and any other casters (though note that Mages and Druids can dispel it).
---
* **Mage** \- Even more control than a Rogue, and they have damage shields to boot. The downside: Those magic shields are susceptible to Purge. You risk immediately dying to a Rogue/Feral Druid/Warrior when your shields fall off. These glaring weaknesses can be covered up by hanging in the back of the group and causing  chaos with CC, rather than sitting on the front lines and casting damage spells like a Shaman would.
---
* **Priest (Shadow only)** \- They play similarly to Soul Link Warlocks, and might actually have better burst damage than them thanks to Mind Blast. The downsides are that they do not have a pet and their only CC is on a long-ish cooldown. If you can survive one round of DoTs + a Mind Blast or two, then you can beat a Shadow Priest.
---
* **Paladin (Ret or Holy)** \- Paladins are the best healing and defensive support in the game. Even when they're Ret - the toolkit doesn't change. Regardless of spec, a Paladin should keep up Blessings on his entire team, he should use Blessing of Freedom on the Warriors, use Cleanse to remove any and all debuffs on nearby teammates, and help set up kills with Hammer of Justice and Repentance. Holy does this while healing, Ret does this while attacking - the end result is the same.
---
*B-Tier*
---
* **Warrior** \- Probably the worst 1v1 class in the game. They are a force to be reckoned with in larger groups, however. When properly supported with defensive dispels and heals, they can easily top the charts for damage and killing blows (well, only if the Shaman are asleep or busy off-healing). Every group needs at least one Warrior. That said, I put them at B-tier because their solo play is trash.
---
* **Priests** \- Similar to Warriors, healing Priests are not great 1v1. They shine in groups, where they are 100% necessary. They're in the B-tier for their lack of impact in solo and open world PvP.
---
*The Wild Card*
---
* **Hunter** \- The Hunter class is in a weird spot. They're great 1v1 and in group PvP. I always want a good hunter on my team. But when everyone plays perfectly, Hunters lose 1v1 to a lot of classes that they should beat (Rogues, Druids) while relying on Viper Sting to beat defensive casters to run them out of mana (see: Priests). I never underestimate a Hunter, but I'm never afraid of one, either. The best they make me think is "well I don't want to spend that much time fighting this guy just to kill him - I'll pass."
---
That's the one that I'm most looking forward to/scared to hear. There's still tons of important issues that we need to figure out, but amongst them cross-realm battlegrounds is the only one that could become a deal breaker for me.
---
&gt;limited
---
That's a cute word for "zero".
---
Look at your weak-ass 13 dps stick.
---
Now look at gravestone scepter, coming through the door like a gods damned freight train with a world-shattering 29 dps, that for some unholy reason is obtainable before lv 20.
---
Do we know it’s coming out in summer 2019? Yes.
---
Do we know they haven’t officially announced it yet? Yes.
---
Do we know their content release schedule? Roughly, yes.
---
Do we know how they’ve approached previous games? Yes.
---
It’s ok to admit you’re wrong sometimes.
---
I disagree entirely. The class design was sub-par and miles better than cataclysm for sure, that’s why class design felt better in MoP in comparison. Class design in BC and wrath was better than MoP. 
---
And no, many people would disagree on ToT and SoO being in the Top 5. 
---
It objectively isn’t better than anything, it’s all opinion. In your opinion the class design was good, sure. 
---
I'm going to be doing the reverse.  A group of us are going Alliance to see things from the other side.  Best of luck, whatever route you decide to take.
---
Cata was fun pre-dragon soul. MoP was also great.
---
You don't need to roll NE, these mounts are tradeable.
---
None of those points, or indeed any of the information we've been given so far, have anything to with an actual release date.
---
Do we know it's in Summer? Sure. And what about that is it that you want to discuss/debate? Which summer months you like best?
---
This post is devoid of any content.
---
And that underwater questing zone WTF IS THIS SHIT
---
If that’s your opinion you are welcome to not visit it, yet here you are. I’m unsure what you are getting from this, do you enjoy trying to put others down?

I love blizzard but right now i'm striking against them in my own way, which is not playing their games and i have them all...
---
I'm waiting for classic and if its gonna be as good as it was and if the communication will stay as it is right now then that will truely restore my faith in blizz.
---
Also i hope wc3 will turn out good because thats another gem that i want to play and i believe they wont trash their beloved icon of a game.
---
Its funny how blizzard is now counting on nostalgia  when they could have made legion one of the best expansions in wow, not only they didnt made it with legion they shitted all over it with bfa... 
---
I'll just wait to our lord and savior Classic.
---
No no no just back it up and go home you're drunk 
---
I will not level 1-60 on a fresh realm after Classic's launch. Not many people will even consider the notion. If there isn't a RPPvP server in on launch, it will never be populated. 
---
At 9am? I don't think so!
---
Relatively high? That's a 1999 CPU and a 2001 GPU.
---
&gt; Least gear dependent in pvp: Mage, Rogue, Hunter. They don’t need much gear to shine because of all the control, survivability and utility they have. 
---
yes
---
rogues have abilities that give static dmg meaning you can hit well even without gear
---
and also have talents that help get crits
---
mages too have talents that help get  fat crits half the time under certain conditions
---
There was never a need for any loot trading. Wasting dev time for retail level hand holding.
---
WoW was the main game for a long time, and it even leaked and ruined their other old franchises. So don't you fret, WoW will be going strong for a looong time.
---
It still rustles my jimmies. Although... somehow that feels nostalgic..
---
And reporting non-tos related things should of course be handled as a tos-violation itself and bring those who abuse it into trouble.
---
The goal shouldn't be to make reporting difficult (try manually reporting player Yẻētlær) but to be strict with its implementation and handling. Word will spread around that reporting someone for ganking isn't a good idea, if it potentially could cost you paid gametime.
---
pve/pvp you mean that dont need respec?
---
Vanilla - Amazing community. You knew everyone on your server by name. You knew who the best geared players were and respected them.
---
BC - Flying mounts came out and the community instantly died. You never saw the same people again because you were always flying from point A to point B on autorun. 
---
Wrath - The beginning of the end when Blizzard added the Dungeon Finder in 3.3 and you could queue for dungeons without ever interacting with people. 
---
Cataclysm - Put the nails in the coffin with things like LFR, phasing, cross realm zones. WoW as we knew it was officially dead. 
---
MoP - Played only the beginning but it seemed to be a continuation of Cata. 
---
WoD/Legion/BFA - Did not play. Don’t even want know how bad it was/is.
---
o yah I remember pentiums being the shit
---
Lmao thank you for the best comment I’ve ever read in this sub.
---
&gt;And reporting non-tos related things should of course be handled as a tos-violation itself and bring those who abuse it into trouble.
---
Yet to see that happening in any game, and I severly doubt it will be any different with classic WoW.
---
Overall the report culture is just a huge tumor to gaming communities, as it adds so much room for abuse, and gives too much power to faceless nameless people without any accountability. Instead Blizzard should to their own fucking job and ban cheaters, and besides that ignore function solves 99.9% of any other issues.
---
This isnt my issue. My issue is the auto silence. The "you've typed to many messages recently" bullshit.
---
Nothing stopped me talking and being part of the community faster. I just went "oh well" and moved on from the conversation.
---
THIS needs to go. 
---
a backpeddling clicking r14 :D I am in awe
---
and the healthbars seem to lag a bit like you see the dmg numbers but it takes like 1 sec for the hp to drop
---
WoW Classic is just an excuse for them to be 'Blizzard Classic'...you know, the days when they made changes based on feedback.   
---
This is awesome. 
---
I don't fool myself nether should you : they just want the $ after they saw the popularity of privates servers. I think they just see classic as a low investissement/high incomes thing, so you won't see a real engagement with their servers (no official events, no GM, automatised support etc). As you see my expectations with Blizzard are the expectations with a low tier company. As it should be if you don't want to get disapointed.
---
I want to know for sure if there will be oceanic servers.
---
Honor-cattle as we call them.
---
Linkin part obviously
---
and Warcrat 3 soundtrack
---
Era - Ameno
---
P is for PROTECTION!
---
Wow aren’t you so mature
---
It depends what you want.  Classic is like playing a retro game which you will have no nostalgic connection to.  It will seem very basic compared to modern MMOs.  If that is what you want to experience then wait.
---
However wow is doing a free trial this weekend should you wish to try retail in its current form.
---
I intend to play both :)
---
A tank can be naked with a dagger and shield. The question is if the healers can keep up though...
---
I'm actually a sw developer, so yeah, I know how coding works. 
---
Classic will use separate client and backend than 1.12 did, it is obvious some things can't be implemented in the new code easily or the devs might not even notice it needing new implementation.
---
My question didn't change. Am i or anyone who disagree with sharding supposed to give solution to it?
---
&gt; Also when you say something is bad 
---
now you attribute false statements to me to make it easier for you. Again, sorry but i didn't say it's bad i said it should be removed. I don't care is it bad, good etc. it's a problem that will influence on game directly and this is problem not because it's "bad". By the way,  when you endow an object with attribute/s which determines it, this does not mean that at the same time the opposite property is being created so that you can determine the first because it is not required unless it were originally given definitions from which follow this conclusion. That's how a small part of the basic logic actually works, but thanks for the lesson, i guess.  And please stop opposing me and some imaginary people, I still do not feel like a small, insignificant person who is ignored, I am far from alone in this issue. But more importantly, it does not answer the question of who should seek a solution. 
---
Yup, which is one of the biggest downside of bear form, no Oh-shit HP pot or invulnerability potion.
---
The problem is that classic/sharding is that classic is much more likely to start with the majority of the population interested in playing and having that slowly/rapidly decline over time.  Vanilla had the opposite where only a small portion of the eventual vanilla population was playing at release and it increased over its lifetime (needing the additional release of servers) but even then still had issues with the occasional ghost town server.  The ghost town server is much more likely to happen in classic and sharding is thought to be one way to potentially alleviate that by increasing the beginning population with the hope that it stabilizes around the ideal population after the rapid decline early on.
---
Retail WoW topped with Frozen Throne. I stuck around for a few more expansions, basically just.leveling to the cap, and then quitting.
---
Looking back I think it stopped being fun for me when talents got changed from "a la carte" to "pre cooked dinner in a tin".
---
&gt; I know its just a pipe dream but i would love classic to be a reboot, to see Blizz release new content (possibly new xpacks) but follow the classic design elements, keep the social and harder core elements.
---
Although I don't think it's likely (but fun to speculate!), it will be interesting to see how they react if there are a lot of players.
---
Lets say Classic gets 3 million players around launch, and this drops to ~1.5-2 million consistently after a year. This would easily be enough to justify continued development of some kind.
---
I wonder how few subscribers there'd need to be for them to justify  doing literally nothing after all the phases are over, and Classic is 'finished'.
---
The minimum they could do, which could be interesting at least once or twice, would be to re-launch fresh servers starting the phase rollout from scratch.
---
Glad to see you've found this !  
---
It would be great if you could also show it to your friends at Epic Projects f you're still there :)  
---
Meanwhile there is a discord server for the Azjol- Nerub Players :)

---
I remember listening to The Instance religiously during the later half of TBC and all throughout Wrath and a little into Cataclysm. Those guys were great! They were easy to listen to, fun and you always learned something new with every episode.
---
Sure they were casuals who didn't know much about the hardcore raiding or PvP scene but that was fine really, I doubt most people would be able to listen to a hardcore focused podcast and be able to keep it. It would probably also be really dry and boring.
---
The only thing I didn't really like was the lack of other perspectives, you only really got to hear about Hunter and Priest news since that was what they played. Scott played a Hunter and Randy played a Priest. Oh well. At least if you were a guild leader you could get some advice from Randy who ran &lt;Alea Iacta Est&gt;, the official Instance guild.
---
&gt;  For which classes is the tier gear best suited? 
---
rogues hunters priests and protwarrs actually wear t1 and t2
---
the rest use almost nothing.. maybe a few pieces.
---
If it gives honour it should be allowed to fight back. If lvl 53s weren't chain-missing and chain-resisting they might actually be able to make a ganker work for their honour points and a ganker might be more careful engaging two at once.
---
Thus I think a system where the penalties are a lot lower (unless the difference is over 10 levels to avoid abuse) is a better designed system but it isn't consistent with original vanilla.
---
I think it already is
---
This is actually incredible. They are striking a balance between sticking to the original 100%, and making changes that will actually improve the game
---
Mop was one the greatest expansion, i thought everyone understood that now. Meanwhile Wod is one of the worst thing i ever played
---
There are more factors to consider here. Cata / MoP expansions were released during a time where people who played WoW for a seriously long time really started moving on.
---
That's a 1999 CPU and a 2001 GPU which can barely handle a 2004 game. PC's got stronger so fast back then that you'd only be able to play the "latest" games for 2 years tops. Nowadays my PC is 6 years old and still handles the vast majority of games with no issue whatsoever. It was a monster at the time of purchase, but back in 2000 a monster would still be outdated in 2-3 years.
---
Server names for sure. 
---
Meh.  The happy solution for me would be an "old school AV weekend in the rotation" and for that weekend if you queue for AV you get thrown into the 1.6/1.7 or whatever map version rather than the 1.12 version.  So its available for a weekend or so every month for those who want to relive the 2-3 day straight AV battle and those who want to just rush it can rush it the remaining \~25 days of the cycle.
---
You're speccing Subtlety for the combo point regeneration, not solely for the cooldown.
---
It's just that you don't have the option to standing on top of Princess for long periods of time so you can't take full advantage of combat daggers or swords.
---
Subtlety just becomes a better alternative for that specific fight because you have to kite so much.
---
I actually wear them right now on my level 50 hunter on a pserver :D
---
Also: Staff of Westfall &amp; Tunic of Westfall go a long, long, way with you.
---
Yeah, I can tell you that the gold thingi won't work. I played on a 10k+ population private server and the pug community is actually quite tightknit. In 90% of the 20men pugs, you had atleast 2-3 people knowing each other from pugs.
---
Do shady shit, one guy calls you out to the pug leader (as you stated you may not host your own but join yourself sometimes) and he will keep an eye out for you.
---
On a server of \~3k you will be able to taint your name in about 2-3 pugs, I'd say. 
---
There was a raid host who once ninja'd an epic in UBRS and plainly admitted it. It took hours for him to fill pugs henceforth. 
---
Yeah, and why wouldn't he call you out? The very least that will happen is that the raid lead will keep an eye out for you.
---
If you play rogue/hunter/warrior/mage, you will never be invited again, because there are boatloads of people applying as these classes.  
---
A raidlead will think twice about inviting somebody who may have the ability to break the pug run midrun by acting out on his phantasies as he did before.
---
I played classic and made friends in starting zones because of crowding. It's part of the experience. Teamwork and communication is great 
---
You will never do every quest while levelling there are simply so many you will be st about 30 days played before you get even remotely close. 
---
This is not like an expansion, there are just so many zones and quests you won’t realistically be able to complete every quest unless you want to do them for zero exp and massively reduced rep
---
You can't reach def cap before BWL I think ...
---
I tanked Drak in full green with a arms spec. It wasn' t easy, but it's doable.
---
Cross realms bgs killed them for me, I really hope it will not be the case
---
0.5 will come in a very late phase
---
you had to complete a long chain of quests involving some mob kills, some special boss events in dungeons, gold costs and the worst which was the 45min baron rivendare run.
---
I'll buy the item from anyone who tries to sell if I really need it and then I'll be calling you out as the trash ninja you are. 
---
The fact that blue posts seem to multiply these days, and announcing a bunch of good news (sorry for the RP-PVP realms, I'm not interested in!) make me quite optimistic we will get more news about a beta date (release date would be better but I'm not that optimistic!) soon!
---
Damn, I would instantly abandon my current pserver to start over on a official beta server, even knowing in advance that any toon I would create woukd be deleted after a few months!
---
can u raid with subt tho?
---
You never know with angry nerds. 
---
I am one of those people, i moved on once MOP as announces. 
---
Well, it has been +10 years since I played.
---
Just decided to fire it up with the free weekend, for a bit of nostalgia and had my character in the middle of nowhere in the Outlands.
---
easy
---
That and pet battles.
---
The only thing I hate about horde is leveling in Barrens. I mean, I love the culture there but the quests are quite boring. 
---
&gt; Blizzard typically announce the exact release date of a wow xpac 2-3 months before release. 
---
For the latest two expansions the release date announcement was slightly more than 4 months before release (131-134 days).
---
If you want to do every quest in the game, what's the difference between doing the gray quests when leveling or at 60 ? You won't get any experience in either case.
---
Ooof. I must have been lucky. I was rocking a Pentium 4 (with hyperthreading!) with 1gb RAM and a 256mb GPU. I started late 2005 - the same day we got our adsl hooked up!
---
Yeah I agree 100 percent with the notion that most don’t care, like I said I  think it’s weird but ultimately I stil play with a TON of people who do it so 🤷🏻‍♂️ live and let live
---
Its literally says in the numbers that it wasnt part of vanilla, you know... the 2 part...
---
&gt;Downranking spells was very common for all classes because mana costs got absurd with your level 60 ranks of spells. If you let a level 40 mage have their 80/85% chance to hit against a level 60 warrior.. suddenly the level 40 mage is a very legitimate threat, casting spells doing nearly the same damage a level 60 mage would probably be hurling.
---
Dmg spells weren't downranked. Except nova, r1 frostbolt etc. Lvl 60 mages did not cast lvl 40 spells to deal dmg and especially not in pvp. (And that's without factoring in and spell dmg gear that you got at 60)
---
The presence of many fire elementals and the sort made fire wands somewhat lackluster. Frost damage was needed for the boss in AQ40, aswell.
---
I felt the same for a while, but I know that my nostalgia trip won’t be whole unless I roll ally. Plus my RL mates want to roll ally too. 
---
How do you know about alliance leveling if you never even had a lvl 1 ally toon ?
---
Yes, and then both teams run past each other because fighting doesn't have a point in the bg
---
MC, onyxia pug are common. ZG and AQ 20 even more.
---
Don't they have addons for that ?
---
Personal preference would be to just add a /ignore automation to the right click report.  Not a big fan of having to type out /ignore RandomGoldSeller500 everytime and adding them to my ignore list.  Can't actually think of anyone else I ever reported/ignored in vanilla or TBC besides gold sellers.
---
Yess. And or Asian servers...
---
I am just explaining that this is simply impractical and pointless. Do you have fun at 60 doing s lvl 30 quest for a reward that is next to worthless. Just have s look at resources online and work out how many quests there are, I have tested about 95% of quests in the game using a gm account and it too me years even with ports and instant kill commands. 
---
If someone wants to waste years of their life then I am not going to stop them 
---
How many servers they will have in each region and the server types.
---
How is this OC?
---
Wow Africa would be lit
---
So the argument here is that you wanna be able to pvp with people on your server and recognise people there right? 
---
I see how that would be a good thing but aren't there some pretty considerable negative aspects too like potentially long cues, loosing to the same premade over and over etc.
---
Pentium processors and Voodoo graphics cards
---
90s.jpg
---
yeah if im given the choice between 30 min queues or cross realm BGs you can guess which one im going to take
---
I dont remeber exactly how much dps was but it was significant. remember, there were glancing blows in vanilla because the boss were 3 levels above you, the human racial basically make the boss be only 2 levels reducing glancing blows.
---
If it had been separated how did chens empty kegs end up in the barrens?
---
Doesn't wpvp require some toggle now in retail? I haven't played since 2016.
---
But those aren’t progression raids. You’d see Kara/gruul/mag getting pugged in BC, too. But BWL/green dragons/AQ40/naxx and SSC/TK/BT/Hyjal/Sunwell don’t get pugged. In WotLK, you’d see everything up to and including ICC getting pugged. True vanilla/BC is about guild raiding. 
---
Honestly battlegroups was a decent idea. 3 or 4. Or was 2 or 3? Realms link together for only BG ques was perfect. You can still recognize names and guild and had actual real times under 20 minutes for bgs
---
Up to 9% for warriors, less for rogues.
---
Or a tauren if you are in fact a stud
---
There used to be confirmation on pressing need for bop items and another prompt saying that loot will be bound to you and not traded further. It already is vanilla thing 
---
I can, but personally I'd take the 30 min queues. It gives you time to go out and explore the world or do some duels while you wait for the queue to pop, and when it finally does it's exciting.
---
I know some people just want to PvP which makes long queues a big issue for them, so this is one of the issues that has no right choice - a large portion of the playerbase will be unhappy either way.
---
Something in the region of 3-4% for rogues, 5-6% for warriors. 
---
Amount of launch realms and population cap per realm. I think it's very important for Blizzard to inform us about these especially before launch. Lots of people who are coming back are doing so in large groups of friends who used to roll together. Personally I've got around 10 or so real life friends in fact from the same town who're planning on coming back. It would be great if we could coordinate and pick the same realm etc.
---
It worked historically. The soulstone was simply a buff once used, and every warlock would use it before logging out back in vanilla. I don't think anybody cared, and it was just one of the ways you learned to use any and every means of achieving success.
---
And ? Loot there is still valuable. Some piece of gear are even bis until Naxx or forever. Even in a raiding guild, items like choker of the firelord or band of accuria are still highly wanted even if they are in AQ/Naxx.
---
&gt; I'd take the 30 min queues
---
yeah theres nothing like having a few hours to kill and wanting to grind out some BGs for fun and spending the majority of that time waiting for it.....
---
pass
---
Exactly.  But even when leveling. Blasting a undead mob with a shadow wand was a bad idea.  So for priest two Wands was almost mandatory.  (Just keep your old one as you exchange it normally).  
---
And their guild will be clearing Ony/Mc/BWL in a couple hours when they’re in AQ/naxx. Guild raiding is what vanilla is about. This will not be an issue in guild raids. 
---
Since Classic is not considered an expansion, but rather a stand alone game technically, it would be interesting to see how the announcement for other Blizzard games is compared to their actual release. 
---
I thought it was weird not to rub your nipples, have I been playing games wrong for the last 30+ years?
---
Are investors a scapegoat ... like when I think of investors I think of "Hey take my money and make some more of it for me" not "Heres my money and I want pandas".  Like I could see them "maybe" pushing for deadlines or something overarching like that but individual design decisions etc should be 100% on the directors/managers/chiefs etc that are being paid to make a game that people will play.  I and I think most people here have pretty much no idea how the internal workings of the company are and who decides what directions things should go.
---
You just gave me insight as for why I always thought undeads were hard while leveling my affliction warlock... I never realized that, despite not being immune, different mobs had different levels of resistances...
---
Warrior it can be as high as 13%. The rule is: the earlier you get +weapon skill, the more its worth.
---
Once you do 90% yellow damage by cleaving/HSing, +wep skill is not as important anymore (late AQ40+ gear).
---
If you rock edgemasters + preBiS swords + 5racial wep skill, it is a huge difference.
---
Rock solid 
---
When he was with rexxar I believe, sure someone who knows the lore more in depth will be able to tell you. 
---
Did it complete itself for you? Mine did that a bit back. 
---
I wholly agree. RP-PvP is the best of both worlds, and will have a larger percentage of the playerbase now in Classic than Vanilla because most of us are older players now. Many of us want to delve into the lore and immerse ourselves in the best game ever in a way we didn't the first time around.
---
RP-PvP servers are home for us. I want to go home.
---
Yet..
---
I don't get it. What's the relation to Classic/Vanilla?
---
The fact is you usually don't have 100% attendance (especially on raids like that) so unless you are a big guild you will have to fill empty slots with pug. Heck on my server lot of guild don't even have full roster and have to fill up to half of their slots with pug for progression raids and still clear the raids fine.
---
Fact is pugging will be common.
---
As I said, I can understand that's a deal breaker for some people, but for me and many others it's the opposite. Remember that unlike retail it's not like you're grinding out tokens or currency from bgs, so it's just an extra fun activity you can queue to play while you do some other shit.
---
I imagine they'll likely meet halfway and have 2-3 server battlegroups to try to keep queues max 10-15 mins but we'll see
---

And they already said it before. They said that someone discovered a "backup of a backup" of 1.12 data and that's why they were able to create an 1.12 client/server in house for reference purposes.
---
They don't have data from before 1.12 (well, they have some from "slightly before", which I interpret as bits and pieces from 1.11 and that might not even include anything for AV).
---
I find it *extremely* weird that they say things about Classic that they "decided" to give us 1.12 when we (those of us who paid attention) have known for a long time they don't have data from before 1.12. They just create unnecessary angst.
---
\&gt;  Or leave it in limbo of pre cata wrath? 
---
The worst thing that can happen. If leave it in limbo, do that on 1.12.
---
But, what I can say. Sometime after 1.12, several months, is when they should introduce a thing called "rulesets".
---
So, there would be 3 clients: Classic, TBC and WotLK, eeach with its own music, artwork, loginscreen, quests, PVP, etc.
---
And, each server would have its own rules, such as:
---
1. Standard (same as the original vanilla), Seasonal (2 resets a week, slightly increased XP rate, increased drop rate, patch every month), Relax (Slightly lowered XP rate, longer periods between patches)
---
2. Last patch (the time when a server stops getting patches)
---
3. Fresh/changed content (aka, post-1.12 raids, Caverns of Time, level 60 Karazhan, etc)
---
So, there would be servers that never get past 1.12. If the population drops really bad, they will eventually merge into one, forcing name changes for duplicate names. But, no -SteamwheedleCartel endings.
---
Check. And for many, it wasn't even because the game started to suck or anything, but because they have played WoW for years and finally found a moment to stop the game and move on ;-)
---
True, and then BfA team is destroying that faith for me.
---
He's not putting others down, we literally have no other info other than summer. That could be anywhere up to September 30th.
---
Is pet battles something that a lot of people wanna see them do away with? 
---
I didn't think it affected gameplay at all, it's not like you have to do it. 
---
Same. The lore died with wrath of the lich king.
---
Cata seemed real forced and was a total let down, but I tried to give it a shot.
---
When mists was announced it really felt like WoW had become an entire universe from warcraft and I no longer wanted to play.
---
Na, you’ll be able to clear MC and Ony with less than 40. Plus, T2 legs/helm and thunder fury/sulfuras gives incentive as well as the items you mentioned. You won’t need to get pugs to join your guild run unless you’re not in a real raiding guild. ZG and AQ20 already require half the amount. 
---
Wrong reddit, fuck
---
You should really drop the second "of". Even though it's common for you 'muricans, it is ugly and redundant
---
It’s gonna be really interesting to see he recommended specs for classic, I’m expecting a 2 core processor, 4GB of RAM and 40GB of HDD space
---
People will always complain.
---
 Sharding. Right click report. Just two things that are still hot topics.
---
I need to know what server Asmongold and co are rolling on so i can choose another
---
&gt; Keep in mind you can always merge a PvE server into a PvP server but never the other way around.
---
This still implies that you’re merging a PvE server into a PvP server which is the wrong. Ultimately in the end you would just have a PvE server. While the reasoning my have changed over the years, ultimately blizzard has never merge a PvE and PvP server where the end result is a PvP server. If anything all servers are PvE now. 
---
Ah yes. Right click report is a much bigger issue imo, as long as they stick to their plan for sharding (it isn't ideal, but will only affect a couple weeks as opposed to the entire duration of the game).
---
I think we need to make our voices heard on this one especially.
---
We still need to know about WSG, AB, and when the pvp honor system will be implemented. And what version of the pvp gear will we get when the honor system is released. 
---
This is a good one. We do know that they are working on this, though. Our voices may help mold that decision, though.
---
Arcane Explosion has a 10% chance to proc per cast, same as any other spell. The number of targets hit doesn't increase the chance.
---
If the number of targets hit increased the odds of proccing Clearcasting, spells like Blizzard, Arcane Explosion and Flamestrike would ensure 100% uptime on Clearcasting.
---
I remember when my dad brought home Neverwinter Nights and we couldnt wrap our head a around a 1gig file size. We had to clear just about every other game off the HD. Man times change 
---
Just wanted to say, you can tank all dungeons as a fury just fine, BUT it isn't much fun for all parties involved.
---
Sorry for the people downvoting you.
---
I don't know what personal loot means but it sounds like something that wasn't in vanilla. Boss drops an item, people roll on item, highest roll wins the item. There is no "their loot" to give, only the drops on which anyone may roll on.
---
I honestly found tanking sunken temple as my leveling spec harder than tanking dungeons at 60 on my warrior although this was in large part because I went prot spec.  If you didn't go prot you could still tank it provided you know what you are doing, it just makes it harder on everyone involved (healers push their mana pool harder, dps have to watch threat etc).  So if you find people who accept you for what you are you can tank at 60 as fury and probably finish but the healer will be internally screaming probably for the entire run.
---
- I didn't get anything from Greatfather Winter  back in 2006.

- I hate fishing

- My bank alt REALLY  needs a Crimson Felt Hat,  that should be equipable at lvl 1!!!!!

Older Korn (up to See You on the Other Side)

I wouldn't try it.
---
The point of speccing subtlety for Maraudon farm is that you can do it in semi crap gear/pre-raid. Later when you have better gear combat swords is preferable.
---
But there are other ways to make gold that don't involve respeccing. If you don't want to dedicate an hour of your time just to recouperate the gold loss from respecs before you can start to make money back you could do other grinds.
---
It's all about time investment vs. payoff. For Rogues it's probably not worthwhile to farm Maraudon. My original point was that it can be done fairly easily.
---
I seriously cannot go back to playing non-oceanic servers.. Vanilla was a consistent 400ms and while it seemed fine I have now seen the light.
---
I don’t care about the outcome of AV or RP-PVP servers but my joy for WoW Classic will be 100% killed if we don’t have them.
---
&gt;Linkin Part
---
You mean Linkin Full, since we still had the whole lineup, then :(
---
If you just want to grind out BGs against random people I know the place for you!
---
Nope, this is clear evidence that Classic is superior and the community is generally both better looking and more virile.
---
What if the Classic release was a part of a long-term experiment? What if they're trying to make WOW a seasonal progressive game?
---
&gt; Is there anything left to complain about?  
---
Oh you sweet summer child.  
---
When 39 people get to add you to a blacklist for each 1 piece of loot that you ninja, ninjas will only be able to get in a couple pug raids before being completely blacklisted by the server community and will basically have to reroll.
---
blizzard are ✡
---
When 39 people get to add you to a blacklist for each 1 piece of loot that you ninja, ninjas will only be able to get in a couple pug raids before being completely blacklisted by the server community and will basically have to reroll. 
---
\&gt; Your character can eat and drink at the same time
---
The top showed before I even had a need to eat. I would just drink.
---
I had a CD player
---
They would have to know that i did ninja the item and with loot trading they won't be able to see it.
---
Wholeheartedly agree. Not having a RP-PVP server from the start will hinder a large chunk of the community. Lets hope they change their mind and add one at the beginning. 
---
Because they don't want to devote as many GMs to fixing loot issues as they did in 2004-2006 on a game with no box price and no future expansion purchases, and at a time where $15/m is worth less?
---
It makes sense why they want to do it. And don't say that they should just not devote gm time to it because that isn't vanilla, either. 
---
Sadly I don't know what kind of PC I had upon launch (which was spring 2005 for me as European)  But it was not much, I think some kind of Celeron? did they still have those? crap CPU.  Within a few months I went to an Athlon 64 with a decent graphics card and I think I kept that one for years and years 
---
They are using 1.12 as a **starting point** to create Classic. It's not like they're going to run version 1.12 of wowserver.exe and be done with it. There will be many slight changes, mostly technical (Graphics and engine). And I have no doubt that certain values will be tweaked or tinkered with.
---
But 1 hour queues were also painful. Would be best to start regular and go xrealm in phase 6. 
---
Good point; the shot is one I took from a long-lost EB Games leaflet that I still have after 13 years. I did not print it, but it's not reposted.
---
so u better off doing brd pickpockets or rfd disenchanting?
---
With how big things like reddit and discord are nowadays, all it'll take is a screenshot of the whisper from the ninja posted to either the Classic WoW subreddit/discord or even to a specific server's subreddit/discord and I'm sure you'll have at least one person in your next pug that will have you added to their blacklist.
---
Wait I'm sorry, in that quote I realized I had accidentally wrote PvE where I should have wrote PvP and vice versa. A PvP server can get merged into a PvE server no problem but not the other way around, according to Blizzard's server transfer policy.
---
Old school epic mounts, yes or no, and if yes, for how long  
---
Beta, yes or no, and if yes, when  
---
Server names and types, and ideally (even though this isn't a Blizzard concern) which servers streamers will play on so you know which ones to avoid
---
 Ever was never will be important, if you want to rp on a pvp server nobody is stopping you. Just rp, you don’t need a predetermined rp server.
---
The way they see it, it's an upgrade for me (a minor one) and they think i'm actually being gentle with them because it's a bigger upgrade they can get for some golds. Being called out depends alot on how well you can act. Also just avoid the extrovert players, from my experience they are the one that will call you out more often.
---
Also, like i said previously, if you want to avoid any risk, you can just have on of the guild alt that you don't care if he can't join future pug do the selling. If it's like in wrath you can trade to a player who then can trade to another player.
---
It's Google, not Wikipedia, which provides the image. It's the first google images hit on riposte. 
---
&gt; they only have 1.12 so Classic will be 1.12
---
Yes and no.
---
They will build Classic upon that patch and client but they will tweak progression etc. It will be a Vanilla emulation and not a 1.12 clone.
---
WoWHead usually posts news/blue posts. You could probably just type Classic into their search and find whatever you need.
---
I need information on Crossrealm Battlegrounds, Right Click player report and the size of sharding implementations.  
---
Also, this is by no means racist, but i would love for russian and chineese people to have their own regions / servers.
---
Exactly. Younger PC users don't realise this, but pre-2005-ish, upgrading your system every year wasn't a joke.
---
I'm not nostalgic for that, at least. Glad that we have some unofficial standards in design nowadays.
---
I never experienced an hour queue, probably your server was underpopulated. Cross realm was the first step to kill the community, I remember that we cooperated a lot before the x-realms, after the patch I’ve never seen anyone from my server again.
---
You know I hadn't really thought about why it felt weird but I think I understand now. When you create a character it's either:
---
- self insert as you feel represents yourself
---
- self insert where the character represents an idealised/shifted version of yourself 
---
- playing a character that fits its own mould you've come up with (no reference to the self)
---
- playing a character because you like the way it looks
---
It's a role-playing game after all, and I think the first 3 satisfy that playing a role thing. Everyone's 'fantasy' in the world is different. For me it was number 1 and hence felt kinda weird but I think I'm gonna go for 3 this time and play a character that just exists as it's own thing.
---
There aren't any addons for classic wow yet. We have to wait for it to be released before we start seeing addons come out for it. They already told us that current vanilla addons won't work and we don't know if Legion/BFA addons will work, yet.
---
Logically I should go Alliance. I'll be levelling a Nelf hunter at some stage, and would prefer a human warlock over an orc. But my Tauren druid was my main, and while I love Teldrassil and Ashenvale, it just feels wrong :p I'm ready to go home, and home is Mulgore and the Barrens.
---
Especially in lower levels, it's less about the tank doing his job right and more about the healers/dps doing their job right. The tank can do everything right, but if you're a level 18 in deadmines with average gear, 3-4 elites WILL kill you.
---
Also the names of the realms would be nice for the reasoning you gave.
---
Celeron's were horrible for enthusiasts, but it was a very energy-efficient CPU at the time, perfect laptops and notebooks. And given that "gaming laptops" didn't exist 15 years ago (tbh, they shouldn't exist today either, but that's my opinion), there was a market for these processors.
---
Shame that budget prebuilds used them to drive down the cost and gave them a bad rap.
---
I believe Ian said during Blizzcon this last year sometime that they were only looking at it for the first couple weeks at launch and only for a few zones (which one could assume is the starter zones, although we don't know if Westfall, Barrens, etc will be affected).
---
You can grind bats in Eastern Plaguelands and they drop 4 different types of greys that should net approx. 50g/hr not including greens/blues that drop.
---
With the lockboxes that drop, plus whatever you gain from disenchanting poor drops it will likely average out to 60g/hr or more depending on luck.
---
The factors that determine how efficient that grind is, is server population, faction balance and time of day. Maraudon is reliable at all hours of the day while the bats in EPL might be somewhat contested.
---
Maraudon isn't necessarily the most profitable, it's just 100% dependable.
---
What will be the point of the old school mounts, though? They're only special because they're rare. If they release them for Classic, everyone will have them and no one will care.
---
If you search for "resources" in this sub reddit and look at the big post of resources there's an mmo champion classic blue post tracker. I check this once every few days. 
---
Also when they plan on releasing each of them.
---
Hmm interesting I see what you mean, but arms could still be possible then.
---
Chinese will just use VPNs and will populate the USA/EU servers, anyway.
---
Yeah, for some of them being anti-vanilla was their only reason for posting anything on forums. 
---
I dont know what chart you're reading, but that drop is at most 2M. You cant read it launch to the 5.4 low. Its either 5.0 to 6.0 or 4.3 to 5.4. Either way, its around a 2m subscriber loss.
---
You also ignore the fact that MoP had an increase in subscribers post-launch that excludes pre-launch hype for WoD. WoW gained subscribers in the last quarter of 2013, when 5.4 was released. This didn't happen when 4.3 was released. 
---
wow thats amazing!
---
Not to mention having 10 times the IQ.
---
I can guarantee you those were not the minimun specs for a capital city. I had to go into cities always looking at the floor and logging of outside
---
Hmm I see, but an arms warrior would be much more fun to play than a ret pally no?
---
They are not using the 1.12 client, just the data.
---
Long queues are bothersome, sure, but I can honestly say that the first time I truly enjoyed BG's post-1.12 was when playing a private server. I want to know the people I fight, learn their behaviour, their playstyle, how to best handle them. I want to make a name for myself and have a social experience in addition to PvP'ing. Queue times aren't even all bad, you can easily do other stuff within them. Creates some variety when ranking if anything.
---
Without that social component, ranking doesn't really interest me at all. I truly enjoy vanilla's style of PvP, more so than later expansions. But even so, I honestly think you're much better off playing a MOBA instead of WoW if all you want to do is PvP against nobodies. Those games are solely designed around that, WoW isn't. WoW is fundamentally a community game, and removing the community from literally any aspect of it is just undermining its own gameplay IMO.
---
As for the premade problem... I've honestly never had that problem in the long term. Back in retail vanilla, you'd sometimes get stuff like the Alliance premade starting up earlier, or the top Alliance guild making a random premade early on in the day. The Horde premade always started up later, but the moment our PuG adventures ran into an Alliance premade we'd always just group up with whoever was online already and start getting in the enemy's way as much as possible. There were plenty of times we'd keep them preoccupied for well over half an hour with a team of 3-4 good players. Even if you still lose, it's a lot of fun to me to fight an uphill battle like that. The top alliance guild premade had a tendency to disband the instant that happened, making it even more satisfying.
---
Hmm i see
---
release date so I can book time off work lol cutting it close atm
---
I know, see the "EDIT". The whole problem is that they pretend they could "choose" 1.8 AV, for example when they can't because they don't have the data for it.
---
Pull smart, watch your healers mana and use LoS to your advantage :) Youll be fine!
---
Been healing through a bunch of endgame 5 mans lately, and the tanks pacing matters way more than gear tbh. I prefer having a fresh 60 who pull smaller groups than a geared dude charging head first into shit. 
---
People really are glossing over this for some reason. It stands to reason they couldn't re-create 1.7 AV or whatever even if they wanted to. 
---
Because in classic there are not much "one person wipes raid" scenarios. Raids consist of 40 people. That means you chose the players you get along with in most semi hardcore guilds. 
---
Player skill started to take focus in BC raiding. In classic people tended to be more focussed on the exploration and group experience. 
---
The idea that classic players hate casuals is downright ridiculis. everybody in classic was in one way or another a casual. What differentiates classic from current wow though, is that players weren´t as disposible and in most cases communication helped to get the more experienced and the more casual player getting the best out of their situation.
---
Holy shit this sub is actually brain dead. 
---
You can get it today no biggie if you really want it. Costs like 10$ more to get a custom card print.
---
Even if they do decide to move on with TBC, I want them to do that quest chain or whatever it was that would open the portal that they said was going to be in the game before an expansion was even considered.
---
10-15 days played.
---
I know, see the "EDIT". The whole problem is that they pretend they could "choose" 1.8 AV, for example, when they can't because they don't have the data for it.
---
And no, data will not be "tinkered with". They also explicitly said that Classic is "not their game to change" and they'll hold the data "almost sacrosanct".
---
Definitely hoping for no cross realm. You get to know the people on your realm, who you fight with etc. It really adds to the community aspect that made vanilla special. You also go to know your enemies, dying again and again to the same really good player for months, he becomes your arch nemesis. Everything about same realm bgs is better and I’d happily sit in a queue to have this.
---
Release date.
---
Wasnt it stated they have data backbuntil 1.8 ?
---
All we know at this point is that Classic will just be what we call vanilla - only Azeroth, no expansions, kept running till  perpetuity.
---
Some users here want Blizzard to launch the other expansion packs after x years/months, but don't consider what will happen (You have Classic, but then introduce TBC. And then WotLK. Cata? MoP? WoD!!?!?!?! etc, eventually becoming on par with retail. So... 2 retail environments?
---
Others just want TBC. Or just up to and including WotLK. Others want another specific expansion pack, the one that *they* enjoyed.
---
And others want new expansions or content, slotted into the existing continents, so the playerbase doesn't get divided across multiple worlds.
---
So yea, I'd be perfectly happy if Classic will just be an optimized version of the old world, with all technical improvements of the retail client, but all the "hardships" of the game of 2005 (Meaning, no flying around, no instant teleports across continents, no LFG, et cetera). The 2005-version was memorable BECAUSE shit was hard and took effort.
---
^^^I'm ^^^fairly ^^^active ^^^in ^^^the ^^^community. ^^^Over ^^^the ^^^last ^^^2 ^^^years ^^^I've ^^^made ^^^70000 ^^^comments ^^^in ^^^the ^^^hunter ^^^discord ^^^if ^^^that ^^^means ^^^anything ^^^to ^^^anyone ^^^here. 
---
I've yet to hear of anyone who doesn't act like a jackass be muted or banned by the auto report. Really, people on reddit claim multiboxers run rampant forcing name changes or mute people, but I highly doubt it's an everyday occurrence. People who get muted / banned are almost always people who deserve it, which is totally fine by me. This is anecdotal of course, but I think you're overreacting to a non-issue. 
---
Especially concerning AV they should conduct a deeper investigation as to what is most fun and meaningful to add to the game, religiously following some version number will not make classic the best version it can be, because the updates did not objectively make the game better.
---
Since they are making so many changes already it makes no sense for them to insinuate 1.12 is anything perfect nor mandatory for that matter, if it is possible to recreate something better and more desirable from earlier on then that is what should be done.
---
I think it was groups of 4 for most of them.
---
I’m not sure how I feel about it yet. I’d like the sense of rivalry just within my own realm, but I also don’t want to wait an hour for a BG if my server becomes unbalanced or dead. 
---
Maybe start off with just your realm and see how it progresses? You could always make the Battlegroups later. 
---
I like exploring item combs and I enjoy heated discussions about why one item set beats another one.
---
On the other hand I don´t care if most of my guild mates don"t. As long as they get along, do their best and value other peoples time, by showing up in time (or give note).
---
In my experience, most guildmates are happy with people meeting those expectations.
---
I rarely post, but this topic is dear to my heart.  
---
I love the immersion of a RP-server, but I also need the thrill of a PVP-Realm. Transferring later on kind of kills the chance to establish friendships during the leveling proces. Blizz, please reconsider opening atleast one RP-PvP realm at launch!
---
 
---
You aren´t comparing though.
---
Tigole, my mannn 
---
See the video. The explicitly say they only have 1.12 data and "slightly before". That absolutely doesn't sound like 1.8 but if you have a source please contribute it.
---
With client I mean the 1.12 talents etc that are part of the client data. Obviously they will not 12y old software...
---
On a certain server atm I have limited playtime and I'm currently 52 in 4 days played following Joanas guide as a warlock. Have no vanilla exp since actual vanilla and have played retail on and off for years. No exp boosts etc. Decent pop. Have played mostly solo apart from a few quests where there were people conveniently around at the time. No professions really aside from first aid. 
---
Not having Tabard of the Protector until Phase 6.
---
Seems fair on average. If you are pretty hardcore and only focus on leveling, below 8 days is my guess. That would mean no pvp, no dungeons and no screwing around. 
---
&lt; Orc thematic background *Uugh* noise&gt;
---
Flashbangs, close combat disarm, and tazer seem reasonable cc types in a shooter. 
---
And to chime in here, those that go out of their way to find a private server are probably more likely to have some understanding of the leveling process ahead of them. 
---
Bless you. With might.
---
All I want is the release date announced so I can plan the rest of my life.
---
First, Classic is not creating the "most fun" game. It's not a reimaging of Vanilla "but better". It's the recreation of Vanilla with all it's warts (and, for some, unfun parts). So that's not really a concern.
---
Still, that doesn't prevent them chosing some other Vanilla patch, like 1.8 or whatever. Except what this whole post is pointing out, that they *don't have* anything else then 1.12. They can't create any other AV.
---
And there aren't "so many changes". See: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4hpic/blizzard_only_has_112_data_why_do_they_pretend/ej6pvxv/
---
My point is that Classic is not a clone or copy but instead an emulation of Vanilla. They want classic to feel like Vanilla so even if they don't have the actual data they can emulate it if they want to.
---
Anywhere in this ballpark is accurate depending on your class, experience with vanilla, and much time you spend actively leveling up. 
---
My first 60 back in Vanilla was about 16 days played. It was my first ever mmo and I was a complete noob. 
---
Yeah, blizzard has never liked PvP servers because all they do is create more problems. Particularly long lasting server balance problems. 
---
It does and while most people never touch it, with recent changes to balance numbers I really enjoy it. World quests (dailies) that both factions are competing for will regularly cause large scale faction conflict (20+ on each side) 
---
NWN was pretty good. They put out an enhanced edition and there's a ton of decent servers still.
---
I've always had faith in Blizzard, it's Activision I don't trust. 
---
I never claimed they would use the old 1.12 client...
---
Why would they do this with chinese servers?
---
No, sorry, I do not have a scource. Just have the feeling that I heard this somewhere.
---
This is absolutely the best way to do it, I think. Wait and see what the server pops and faction balances are like; there's no point in grouping servers into battlegroups from the get go and then finding out that *those* groups are imbalanced anyway.
---
We have [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow), though we're not always on point at updating it. 
---
I'd say around 6-8 days played is pretty realistic for an average player depending on how many dungeons you run and what class you play. Say you play around 24 hours a week. So if say anywhere between 1-2 months of  real time to reach 60 is a fair average. Of course there will be folks who don't in a week, maybe two, but I doubt that they will be the majority.
---
Maybe they can't make an exact copy but they can emulate and make AV feel like any patch they want.
---
Personally Im neutral in this. I kinda like AV trains/zergs ;) I hate those mines and as a healer the elites always gank me for heal aggro. But I would be fine with any patch version.
---
How is that tough? 
---
&gt; We'll know 6 months from know how profitable it really is.
---
Im expecting the worst
---
like really small coin numbers for both brd and dm farms
---
Something we still don’t know that could influence my class choice; DM farming. I personally think that blizzlike respec cost is high enough and that DM should be let in its blizzlike form and basically should be farmable by any class. 
---
I think when you pick a class, each has a list of pro and cons and gold farming is a big factor for some. I’m fine with hunters having this perk of farming lots of gold in DMN, not to mention that you fully utilize your tool kit and even professions items to do so. 
---
DM also makes it easier for other classes, especially tanks and healers, to have some money to switch spec, so I think it has a good influence overall and shouldn’t be touched. 
---
both rogue and warrior have great dps all through the content
---
yea except it is not 30 min queue, but dead battlegrounds. When one BGs queue starts to get extremely long, people will just queue the others, leading to even longer queues. Eventually you reach a point where there is just not enough players queuing to launch it.
---
In Classic I will actually be a male tauren shaman. I still prefer the female butts though ;) 
---
I’m aware of how classes perform in PvE overall (that’s why I’m considering switching halfway, cause hunters don’t scale well) but I was mostly worried about how feasible it is to switch main at this point. I mean you just spent months gearing your main. Sure there is catch up gear with ZG and all but still.
---
destruction pvp can definitely use fire spells to great success.
---
So you release them and change them 2 months after launch, that is the idea
---
It will take many months and a lot of your guilds time to swap your main.  There's not much point in a farming alt hunter in T2 either.
---
I guess the answer to your question is, is your guild willing to put up with that? Lol
---
the game launched with DR. Here just one example showcasing both DR on CS , gouge and kidney. World of roguecraft has DR in its clips as well when they showcase how often a rogue can interrupt a fear cast the gouge is effected by DR in it.

---
1.4 added certain slows and roots to the existing list
---
1.9 removed stun procs from the list  
---
rogues permastun works only thanks to blind not being on the stun DR and because people don't use insignias FAPs or LAPs
---
You are welcome
---
I guess it depends how hard core you plan to raid and the guild setup for raiding.  keep in mind that while doing molten core, each boss only drops like 3 pieces of loot for 40 people and youre not guaranteed to get any drops you can use nevermind win a roll / dkp bid.
---
it may be helpful to talk with your raid leader about this since some dkp systems may reset your points when you change mains so you can't pool points for later tiers. or if you do loot council with the knowledge you will be changing, they may be less likely to give you gear if it will eventually be "wasted".
---
but if you are in a one of the hard core raids you may do split runs later which will make gearing a bit easier but still.
---
rogues always scale well, hunters don't but they still bring utility. raiding in vanilla isn't always about highest dps. hunters bring tranq shot so will be needed for encounters, and they have the nature resistance buff too so will be needed in aq.
---
when ZG / aq20 comes out those are on 3 day lockouts instead of 7 so you can get catchup gear in there, and also some from the tier 0.5 set or PVP rewards but it'll be a lot of extra effort but not impossible.
---
that's if you're trying to gear up to aq40 levels quickly. I would just discuss it with the raid leader ahead of time.  in theory, your guild could do alt nights that you can start gearing from if you level early enough or try to join pug raids too. but like I said just more effort and depends on your time commitment. 
---
You said patch and client accidentally, so you kinda did.
---
Posts like these, amirite?
---
I want to play Horde but the horde cities don't feel like home to me, the alliance cities do
---
Yes that’s pretty much the question! I guess the answer is no. But I saw a lot of people talking about having alts so I guess in a way the questions was “if I start raising with a room, am I stuck with it?”.
---
But indeed if I switched to a warrior I don’t see why I would get any AQ gear before the other established warriors.
---
I guess I could see more tolerance for hunters due to how most guilds will want to reduce the amount of hunter in their roster by the time they get to AQ. I could also be overestimating the lack of gear upgrade/overall usefulness of a hunter in AQ and then Naxx if I ever get there.
---
It’s not about farming gold, I enjoy the hunter, but I also enjoy the rogue and the warrior. Hunter is great in the first half of vanilla and on a fresh server and is the easiest class to switch from, warrior scale great after AQ, so that’s why I considered this idea. Rogue is also in the running for a first toon.
---
It’s mostly between hunter and rogue and I’m trying to find ways to choose one, but I also have doubts about the strength of these two classes post AQ.
---
Blizzard will never be cool again. Glory dayz r over wait for new company to get good
---
Sounds like a long weekend.
---
I stand corrected 
---
Are you people theorycrafting discussion topics now, do you workshop these ideas? 
---
Here’s the answer: no, it’s not hard. 
---
At least do cross realms for pre-60 battlegrounds. I remember queuing for bgs while leveling back in the day and it would take hours.
---
This was my first credit card. Used the points program to get a bunch of free months of WoW. Met my ex-girlfriend and eventually went to a dark place and maxed out my $1000 credit limit relocating to Texas, was unemployed and living on ex’s grandparents’ couch for half a year while I let the WoW card go into default, eventually was pulled into court for it and came to a settlement. Paid it off the settlement in full a few years ago. High five for getting my life back in order.
---
Great card, A++ would Tauren again.
---
You should be happy that they don't care of else it wouldn't be a good game. 
---
Yep, I can remember. The day after x realm BGs was introduced, they were never the same.

---
ALL HOPE IS LOST
---
I think no doubt there will be, they already use oceanic servers for all(?) their games, let alone on retail wow. And given the shared subscription, which almost encourages wow players to play both versions of the game- I’d be SO surprised if they didn’t have them for classic, even if it’s just a couple servers.
---
I remember the 1.8 overhaul, and yeah, it was a very big deal.  Indeed, I basically did want people to let me try Feral just so we could see.  To me, that wasn't telling them to fuck off or anything, yet I was still shut out completely, and of course that bothered me.  In hindsight, however, I can mostly see their point of view of things, that being basically what you said.
---
In fact, even back then I felt that for Feral Cat or Bear to even begin to convince people, it was going to require such serious gear that it felt hopeless.  That dread got worse once I later grasped the basics of AP scaling and realized that for Feral to truly work, it probably needed, at the very least, 2-3x more AP than any other class, something the devs were perhaps aware of albeit with only 5 extremely rare weapons in the entire game and something only fully supported with TBC finally.  So it felt like the 1.8 patch wasn't enough even to me, an overly stubborn Feral Druid player.
---
However, you're right that with 1.12 being THE Classic WoW from day one in addition to a natural spread of information about things like post-1.8 Druids, things could be and should be different.  Perhaps it's time to get some of that stubbornness back (not *all* of it) and have more than the feeblest of hopes!
---
Lot's of people say they don't want barrons sharded and I just flat out disagree. I played a pserver at launch recently and the barrens was unplayable madness. Every single mob was spawn camped. Quests legitimately took on average maybe 4 or 5 times the normal time to complete.
---
Anyone that argues against sharding *wherever* it is needed at launch has simply not experienced it.
---
Just the title.  
---
Problem?  
---
There was a pvp video from vanilla called The Path of Destruction by Alenick he was pretty much a warlock Vurtne using blue-green gear and destroying epic geared players. So probably but you will have to learn the class very well though
---
I’d strongly suggest swapping. From Vanilla through Wrath, I played Alliance, then in Cata I swapped to Horde. It’s great seeing both sides of the game so in your shoes, id use Classic as an opportunity to swap.
---
For me, I’m leaning Alliance for Classic to swap again to change it up.
---
The WoW classic community has nothing to do with being nice. Its the nature of the game that brought strangers together extremely well. Nobody said we were gonna be accepting and tolerant
---
In an ideal world yes. But realistically no, today's WoW team have such different design philosophies to Vanilla (I mean, that's a major reason that we are getting Classic, because retail is practically a different game now) that personally I don't trust Blizzard to add anything new to Classic without creating something that clashes with the spirit of the Vanilla game completely. 
---
Yeah it may be a little useless but there isnt a ton of content on here and discussing possible release dates can be exciting even if it's done every other day around here. I say let him have his fun and his post.
---
If your guild needs that class switching isn't really that hard provided you already have an alt max level that has ZG gear and some tier 1/2 from alt/off-day raids.  Might be a bit harder deep in naxx but for many classes like healers or DPS you can get by at least initially with just some good items from the 20 mans(catch-up mechanic) and whatever else you can find from pug/alt-runs of 40 mans.  Happened several times in my guilds in vanilla usually for someone become a healer or off-tank.
---
If I was GM, I'd be pissed if you absorbed a ton of gear on your character just to swap mains at AQ40. If I knew that ahead of time, I wouldn't invite you to the guild.
---
No, because you don't understand the value of well written feedback or criticism. Keep flippin them burgers. 
---
There is something inside me that needs to kill gnome mages
---
Yeah this is a good point, I was going off earlier expansions but should have referenced this
---
Will depend a lot on you guild accepting to carry you thru raid and handing you gear
---
Why
---
Yeah looks like there are ways to catch up but you can pretty much forget about the best loot both on your main and most likely on your alt too, not the best idea.
---
I talked about scaling but I don't care at all for raid dps, I wouldn't even care being a hunter nightfall bitch if it didn't involve spamming wing clip on every gcd for the night. It's mostly pvp scaling I'm worried about. 
---
Hunters, from what I saw, don't improve much after getting T2/chrommy xbow, unless they go all the way and get some T3 and the KT xbow, so it's a long way without significant upgrade where you will surely decline in PvP. 
---
Rogues aren't that strong in a post AQ pvp environnement to my knowledge but I could be wrong. Other classes are as bursty as you but more tanky, and 1v1 wPvP, where you can truly shine as a rogue, is pretty rare at this point in the game. 
---
It equals 3% hit
---
that's a pretty big stretch from the 20 words I've written but you seem to have practice with delusion 
---
They already are a thing in vanilla servers
---
The thing probably is, would storm peaks have ever looked so grandure as it is now if it was built without fling in mind? Personally idk. 
---
Add pvp sets!
---
The beauty about classic is that alt runs become a thing as the game goes on. As the server progresses MC / ZG / BWL become speed runs so it will become easy to gear up a new tool quickly.
---
Can confirm, playing horde felt weird, like infiltrating the enemy camp and never feeling like a part of them or something. Also healing was okay and sometimes fun, but I'm very happy to come back to my mage.
---
This actually makes me hope enough people subscribe and play Classic to make the rest of the company re-think what they're doing.
---
No they are not I have yet to see anyone time instance runs. Yeah there are speed runs but what exactly could be pulled off in the best time possible. 
---
Uh huh, so you're saying when describing subscriber loss during MoP I can't use the number of subscribers that were active *at the launch of MoP* as a starting number. 🤔 
---
The lines on that graph are 2.5mil apart, not 2mil. MoP started at 10 and fell to about 500k below the 7.5 line. 10-7=3.
---
And that bump is literally WoD hype. Did you play or follow the game then? They offered an annual pass when hype started building for their "return to TBC nostalgia through time travel" expansion, and pulled in a bunch of suckers who committed to WoD early.
---
[SoO was the only content for literally more than a year.](https://i.imgur.com/dWGhk1f.png) Are you honestly going to sit there with a straight face and tell me that 11 month old content and not expansion hype is why there was a minor bump in subs 2 months before the release of an (empty) expansion that sold enough to cause that ridiculous spike?
---
You’re over blowing it.  It’s not particularly that hard.  The pain comes from how you decide to do it.  If you want to do them at quest level +5 at most, the big pain is at the beginning when you’re trying to cram the starting zones together before they go grey, worse for alliance because teldrasil is so far out of the way compared to mulgore.  After that you just spend your time bouncing between zones trying to hit all those quests before the rep/experience takes a penalty.  
---
There’s also the matter of what you consider important for hitting up.  According to my dump of quest_template for the 1.12 server, there’s something like 6000 quests give or take, but any given character can do maybe 2/3 of those due to class/faction restrictions, with a good chunk of those being quests that are part of battle grounds or deprecated AV stuff.  
---
It's not hard as in "the answer is easy, you can't" or it's not hard as in "no, switching main is not hard" though. 
---
A billion times this. Particularly the point of "those bits of lore left unexplained". That's what made WoW a real RPG. Not all was explained in details and made "canon". That allowed players to Role Playing more freely. 
---
As more lore was "retconned" (Light save us all) and handed to us "explained" and set in stone, the less freedom RP'ers had.....to the point where WoW became what it's retail today: a single player adventure where you, the player, are the hero from the start. Not just an adventurer you could RP as you wish, but "the chosen one" destined to be the all time savior if all. 
---
WoW as it is today is still a decent game. However it's not a decent RPG any longer (and hasn't been for quite some time now)
---
So to let RP'ers have an RP-PvP realm is pretty much same as to let them have the true RPG experience that made Vanilla what it was: possibly the best *RPG*mmo ever.  
---
Nah, I figure I got you spot on or did the mean words hurt you? lmao 
---
This already exists on private servers. And it’s mind boggling how fast and optimized the runs are.

I wrote they will build upon the patch and client...
---
I started making one in excel using the importhtml function but I quickly got stuck since I have basically no experience with it. 
---
I tried to import the quest tables for each zone directly from wowwiki but couldn't get it to fetch the urls to each quest and quest giver.
---
I also couldn't organize the prerquisites properly to align with the quests because of how the data is imported.
---
I also tried doing it in Python but have zero experience with that as well so didn't get it to work.
---
Tried doing it by hand for a while but it got tedious really quickly and I realised that you're going to have to spend probably 25-30 hours to manually fill an excel sheet with all quests.
---
I've decided that I am just going to write down all quests I do as I go along in excel and compare with the databases to make sure I don't miss anything
---
Writing from experience having leveled several characters with various approaches.
---
6-8 days played for hardcore people that rush, play a lot and optimize.
---
8-10 days for serious players that dont min max everything, but focus on leveling at decent speed.
---
10-12 days for more casual players that dont rush and enjoy their playthrough, but still have experience when it comes to WoW and leveling and dont fuck around too much.
---
12 days+ for people that enjoy doing stuff while leveling (wPvP, battlegrounds, professions etc.) and dont care much about their speed. Also applies to people either new to WoW or coming back after several years.
---
They have been replaced by the "new gamer".
---
And the "new gamer" LOVES BfA.
---
No I really am not, I have been playing since beta, I have completed almost every possible quest in vanilla with the exception of a couple of broken chains on the mangos core and a few class specific quests.  This was done on a GM account with the ability to port between zones' and the ability to add quests without the NPC, it STILL took me MANY MANY months, you are saying you are going to attempt this with normal travel and without the ability to instantly kill a mob.  
---
With realms, hopefully, never closing you could do this, but I just dont see why you would want to try on a single character, you would do better to level multiple characters using different routes, at least then you would end up with 2 or 4 level 60's.
---
Thank God you didn't said bladder.
---
8-12 days for people who are doing it the first time. 
---
People who’ve done it on private servers before will be able to do it in 6-8 days. 
---
And the really fast guys who like to speedrun can do it under 6 days consistently. 
---
Man you got a better PC than I had when I started in Wotlk...
---
Can't say I agree with you. I remember being pissed having to wait over an hour for AV. 30 plus minutes for AB and WSG. If they link 3 or 4 servers for battlegrounds that will not kill the rivalry. We would go on the forums and trash talk and we had one group we loved playing against in pre mades. It was much better with the limited cross realm BG. But that's just me
---
Yeah, especially if you start with a hunter and go pretty hard from the start, it must not be that difficult to level another 60 during BWL patch and get some quick gear no one wants from Ony/MC/ZG, then within a few weeks you could maybe grab a few BWL/AQ 20 pieces as well. Kinda depends on your class, but with the gold from the hunter you could buy some boe too.
---
I guess some GM could even be glad to have one of their hunter willing to switch to a harder scaling class if you warn beforehand, but the issue is that you won't be given the best loot on your main, it's problematic for sure although understandable. 
---
golden days of youtube / wow.
---
True, we will need to see where the chips fall first before people even consider this as an option
---
In my experience :
---
* 5 - 7 days is speedleveler level (no dungeons, no crafting)
---
* 8 - 12 is experienced player going at a good pace but not rushing like a madman
---
* more than 12 days is casual experiencing everything Azeroth has to offer (including frequent trips to the graveyard ;-)
---
* 100 days and up is a quest completionnist (totally made that number up, could be less could be more I have no idea)
---
You will have time to level 2 or maybe 3 characters to 60 before BWL is even available if you play many hours a day/  Once you are raiding your time commitment to that side of progression is probably MAX 8 hours a week.  On private realms many people run multiple characters and raid with them too, your restricted by lockout timers so the maximum you can raid is limited.  Its all down to how much time you have to play and the commitment you want to put in.  Maintaining two characters are current progress is possible, but difficult, so swapping mains at any stage should be as simple as informing your raid leader, beware some guilds with DKP fix it to a character NOT the player so make sure you talk this through with your guild in advance,
---
&gt; I do think some of you exaggerate when you genuinely believe that this feature will "wreck havoc in this game." "You won't be able to find groups and you won't be able to buy or sell profession goods/services." lmao
---
It makes you wonder what their behavior is like that they think they're at risk of being punished like this. There aren't just gonna be gangs of people out there committing right-click-report terrorism, you know? 
---
My point is that Classic is not a copy but an emulation so they can emulate any version of AV if they want. Personally I think it's reasonable to use the 1.12.1 AV though because it's better to make an actual copy whenever it's possible. And I kinda enjoy AV trains/zergs.
---
I’m working on one.  I’m querying the tables from a 1.12 pserver I’ve got running, but that means a lot of pulling references to other tables to make  the thing legible.  I was going to skip rewards because I’m more interested in identifying quest chains, but I’ll see what I can come up with.  I’ll see about posting it in a few hours when I’ve got a little more work done on it, but it will by no means be perfect due to things like quests being flagged for everyone but being offered by faction hostile NPCs that would stop you from getting it from them.  
---
You must have forgotten the 1 to 2 hour wait times.
---
And while I did enjoy some open forum chat banter, all too often someone would ruin it, and need to be put in check. So ultimately I think bans were necessary and kept general order, but that's just how I see it...
---
Well yeah, I'm not saying don't make Battlegroups; I'm saying just wait and see and *then* make Battlegroups as necessary. 3-4 servers is definitely enough to still have a healthy sense of community and rivalry absolutely, but there's no point in even having Battlegroups to account for faction imbalance if you set them up at the start and then it turns out some of those groups are imbalanced anyway.
---
You'd need to look at the servers as they evolve and go 'Okay, that server has 70-30 favouring Alliance, that one has 70-30 favouring Horde. Match them in a Battlegroup, and voila' so you don't end up matching servers together that all favour Alliance side.
---
The reason *why* they keep fucking it up is precisely because of that clean slate. If they *built* on well received features such as the Mage Tower challenges instead of shit-dick ones like fucking artifact power, then they'd be getting somewhere.
---
More druid forms, more weapon skins, more cosmetic items through a solo challenge system. If all the effort that went into the god awful Azershite armour went into something like that, BFA would be much better received. 
---
It'll likely be much more profitable than it currently is on Nostalrius core.
---
It's important to remember that the Nostalrius crew nerfed those gold farm methods because they weren't able to implement an anti-cheat system that was effective enough at the scale they needed it to be.  
---
The best alternative was to nerf the source, because they couldn't deal with the problem.
---
Blizzard are more capable in that respect but even they couldn't stamp out the problem, only mitigate it.
---
yeah I mean I say all this but I bought an external hard drive in order to play lol
---
I really hope it's not 40GB of space, that would be insane just for the "old world". My Vanilla installation, with all kind of mods installed, is 5,54GB. It would be a complete nosense having almost 10x the space required for the same content.
---
We can only speculate, that’s it.
---
We know it’s this summer.
---
I think we should step back and just be grateful that is this summer because to be honest many of us thought that we won’t see classic until 2020, the earliest.
---
Speculating at this point doesn’t make any sense, we can theorycraft based on other releases all we want, but without a solid ground, it is difficult to make any logical predictions.
---
Summer 2019 it’s a finite amount of time, it’s not that far away, plus we still need to see the official date blizz will give us.
---
Not joking and in all honesty, I like having an aesthetically pleasing (female) character.  If I play as a male character (when no good female models or genderlocked or for story purposes in single player RPGs) I really don't care too much what they look like.  Ugly, buff, handsome, tall, tan, whatever doesn't matter.  For female characters I actually take at least some time to get the character ... not ugly.  The exception being my female twin-tails dwarf paladin Hambeast back in vanilla which was made as ugly as possible.  That being said in most games the female ends up covered in armor and even if they aren't I don't notice them 99.9% of the time anyway.  The only exception being Vindictus which actually made me think I could be a fashionista ... that game had a pretty heavy focus on cosmetics though.
---
But back on topic ... no its not weird ... unless you make it weird (don't pretend to be a girl ... unless you really need the money).
---
Hiya, host here, just going to chime in on this one. I played the shit out of Classic. I was just a filthy casual.
---
There is always a constant stream of people quitting WoW for various reasons. The concurrent sub count was just that, concurrents not total. That's why they hit **100 million** accounts in like 2013 or something despite never going above 12.5 million concurrents. I know plenty of people who quit during TBC, Wrath, even Vanilla and moved on with their lives. It happens, but they were replaced by fresh blood.
---
The difference between the first 6 years and the later expansions is that the flow of new and returning subscribers who replace the leavers dried up.
---
Why exactly that happened is very complicated and there are multiple factors, but what was offered by the game itself is self evidently a very important one of those factors. MoP wasn't the only expansion to fail to appeal to players, and I'm certainly not saying it was the worst offender. But it simply wasn't good enough to retain or pull in enough players to keep the subscriber growth or sustain that early expansions had.
---
Because they're breaking the rules and I'd rather they be gone. 
---
Incorrect
---
Fear sends mobs in a completely random direction, occasionally pauses, and picks another random direction
---
You are thinking of “fleeing” mobs. If you get a murloc to 10% hp for example and it flees, it will always run directly away from you.
---
Wholesome video, hope we'll see more people like him.
---
They will be super pissed though if the release date gets released early and then something happens and it gets delayed.  I think blizzard is waiting until they KNOW for certain when they can release.  Holding the release date is upsetting some people but people will be absolutely livid if they have to delay the publicly released release date.
---
&gt;MoP is imo the best class design in the game's history. 
---
I disagree with this a lot, but I'm likely in the minority. The 'press all the buttons and forget about mana' design that began to creep in during WotLK became totally out of control in MoP. The result was boss fights that were (and still are) wildly over-designed. Because players no longer run out of steam through mismanagement or pressure arising from having to cover for player deaths, the game now has to relentlessly challenge you mechanically - but never tactically. 
---
I think Wrath had the best class design because it struck a balance between the resource and strategy focus of early WoW, and the mechanical demands of Cata/MoP etc.
---
&gt;It's also got 2 of the top 5 or so raids Blizzard has ever released in ToT and SoO.
---
I dunno. I remember at the time both raids were definitely considered good, and better than anything in Cata, but not considered in the same league of an Ulduar or a Black Temple or a Naxx or even a BWL. But it's been years. You have to admit though, by the end of the expansion, people were desperately sick of SoO.
---
&gt;You can dislike MoP if you want, but it was objectively well-designed from a PvE standpoint (daily quest debacle in 5.0 aside).
---
This is - objectively speaking - not true. The 5-man dungeons were poorly received, scenarios and heroic scenarios were dreadful, the story patches and new daily quests were boring, and - obviously we disagree on this - the raids were at best mediocre.
---
The raids were also conducted under the failed 25-man/10-man equivalency nonsense, and feature four (I think) difficulty toggles. So no matter how good the raid design is in a vacuum, the disastrous, soul-destroying progression structure of late Wrath/Cata ruined all that good effort. 
---
For me, MoP's biggest upside was the Timeless Isle, which had a fun, energetic old school MMO feel to it. So I stuck around for a lot of that patch. But the rest of it? The most I can say is that it marginally improved on Cata, which I think is still the game's worst xpac. 
---
What Blue post ? Please kind Sir, a fellow person needs a source.
---
Non-issue if you have a good raiding guild. Virtually impossible if you don't.
---
I deleted my Warlock in mixed T1/T2 because I didnt like the female casting animation, and made a male with the same same. Hit 60 and was able to be fed T2 straight away because we had AQ40 on farm.
---
Yeah but man there is always a voice in the back of my head thats says "what if there isnt an oceanic server" i don't think I could survive on 350 ping again.
---
I believe everyone play the game how they want but I’ve yet to understand this entire need to push through all the content of every zone to reach max level and completely ignore 90% of the game.
---
Honestly it’s taken how many years to finally get Blizzard give players the game era so many have wanted and people are planning on pushing past it all just to have a level 60. Sure, it’s not new areas but a lot of this stuff changed long ago and finding all those things again will be fun for some. 
---
I just just don’t see the point of racing to do Black Rock and AV battles only for months on end and not just enjoying that this era of the game is back.

In Vanilla you had to open your ignore list and type in their name. Does the newer client classic is based off have right click ignore?

Warlock must be a pretty good pick for this though, as you usually won't have more then 4/5 in a raid, basically all your locks already had their full T2 I assume, might be different for warriors or rogues. Not to mention that you rerolled the same class so it wouldn't cause the same frustration as if your 8 warriors saw a new one come compete for their gear. 
---
But yeah for sure being in a good guild, that has things on farm, that can do alt runs or split runs, would make this whole thing easier. 
---
Server names with timezone / region and designation (PvE / PvP) would be by far the most helpful piece of information for being trying to be proactive.

Haha, that top 1% feeling. That was my parents pc.. mid 2006 I got one of those amazing AMD 64 bit cpu machines with a whopping 2GB RAM. That thing was a beast! 
---
I feel you dude, as an oceanic player I'd love a simple yes or no on the topic.
---
But if you're in aus US ping should be about 180-200ms on a blizz server. 
---
No city raids? People raided cities all the time in vanilla...
---
&gt;but if it were normal then why feel the need to justify it
---
Every person on the plant undoubtedly exists, but still nearly every person will at some point in their lives try to justify their existence and ask, why am I here?
---
I was just being theatrical for fun.  There doesn't need to be a justification for existing to be normal, and because people feel the need to justify their  existence doesn't make those people abnormal.
---
The problem is that you find the idea of playing a female character yourself strange, when in reality it's normal to be anyone you want on the internet.  In fact, it's even well documented that it's  therapeutic and relieves stress to 'not have to be yourself for a while'  It's why most people play RPGs, but I digress.  You're experiencing cognitive dissonance because you find a behavior strange and the world around you doesn't agree, so now you feel others are trying to justify deviant behavior.
---
You can't go around asking questions and calling every answer you get a justification.
---
We had the same issue in Classic, so our GM finally downloaded a macro that would make a raid warning countdown over three seconds. If he called for rolls, and your roll didn't make it on his screen before the final warning, your roll didn't count!
---
Haha I feel that, let’s hope they confirm soon :/
---
It might do more threat per rage than sunder armor but does that include the fact you don't generage rage from heroic strike like you do a normal autoattack?  Obviously doesn't matter in raids but in some 5 mans you might be rage starved.
---
Am I misremembering but didnt they implement this late in vanilla’s lifecycle?
---
In my opinion this is the perfect compromise between single server only and any server BGs. You wait a reasonable time, but still recognize the names
---
serious question, can't it still be traded in a raid with master loot? if it's a 2 hour window then they can still do it or is it specified that loot trading will be disabled on ML?
---
Oh that's right, back then bgs didn't grant xp right?
---
Yes, such a huge part of vanilla was the community you knew from your server alone. Even seeing the same horde over and over and Knowing you could beat “Cueball” or, “Sandyvag” 1 on 1 before the fight began
---
Do we know how much data they have before 1.12 though?
---
For all we know, they could have a complete data or no data at all. Unless they tell us the exact information we will probably never know.
---
Same
---
it depends on your weapon, but I just thought i'd chime in regarding the OPs casual disregard for heroic strike.  It's situation sure, but heroic strike is super important if you want to hold threat over eager dps.
---
For what it's worth - of your select classes, I'd go with Warrior and Hunter; this allows you to potentially fill 3 different roles in the raid (Tank, MDPS, RDPS) as opposed to just 2 with any other combination (Arguably 1 with if you consider Hunter and Rogue to just be "dps" in general).
---
Which is also good for keeping the game fresh and you engaged, as they also have the most varied kind of playstyles, making you less likely to be bored or burned out.
---
2c. GLHF.
---
„Live to win“
---
You know what must be done. 
---
Sever ties with the crybaby who rolled a 100. They knew what they were getting into of he had the rules set out ahead of time.
---
Ermm... They explain in the video how they worked with data. They didn't have backups they just overwrote stuff. They also said that it was a chance event that they recovered 1.12 data from someone's closet, "from a backup of a backup". And they said they have 1.12 and "slightly before".
---
If, for you, that means "they could have a complete data", I don't know what else to say.
---
Here here. 
---
Man I never even considered this before, as when servers were in place in Live streaming wasn’t a thing.
---
One of my best vanilla memories leveling my warrior was tanking in SM.  Had just recently gotten sweeping strikes so I checked with my healer and we decided to just drop the shield and I pulled out my 2hander and just sweeping strikes/whirlwind/cleaved my way through the zone until we got to bosses.  Doesn't work most of the time but when/if you can pull it off it makes the run much faster.
---
The title is horrible horrible misleading!
---
Haha a "go back to retail" comment! So clever!
---
I think for a lot of guilds they would be happy if you switched from hunter after mc/bwl to a fury war/rogue/mage
---
But like, it's true
---
I knew a guy in TBC who played a female and would constantly tell me how much stuff people give him while playing.
---
I don’t play retail and didn’t play during the twitch age. is it that bad on those servers? What’s different about them?
---
Looks like you aren't searching hard enough ;/
---
True man of the Light
---
They wont do copyrighted stuff - at least that is my experience when i tried to have the shut up and take my money futurama fry meme.
---
They did, but it's just less efficient. You wanna do them once if you got the quests on some classes like warrior, but that's about it. 
---
It depends where you are, in brissy the ping in absolute shit cause ots usuallt routed through Sydney.
---
There's some guild out there claiming they want to raid MC during the first reset
---
My memory is so rusty, thanks!
---
You could just admit you made a mistake instead of covering them up by deleting the comments.  But, I'm not your mother so I can't be held responsible for your lack of bad parenting.
---
You missed the fact that it’s not about private servers(that have skewed quest so rewards) but rather about classic
---
I was poor AF around those days, I remember in 2005ish I had 128mb ram but 32mb was allocated for graphics so when I started WoW I was running windows ME on 96mb ram.
---
Around the time TBC came out I had a job &amp; I did a massive upgrade (by my standards) to an Intel celeron 3.0ghz, 512mb ram &amp; nvidia GT6600 (which I still have today).
---
I see, maybe only with partnered stuff then. 
---
Reminds me of my friend and I jumping off of Teldrassil over and over... ah, the patience of a child. Good times.
---
I definitely spent time just exploring different areas. I remember going through duskwood and finding the grove that would later contain a green dragon.
---
I remember wondering what the hell the portal was for.
---
I also quit during the end of Cata but not because I moved on but because I didn't like Cata and I didn't enjoy the MoP prepatch + MoP beta.
---
Food for thought - the vast majority of your play time was, and will be spent in contested zones, so you will still get to enjoy most of the nostalgia you are longing for.
---
Sure you are trading barrens for redridge, which should only be lasting you a couple days, but you are retaining all the stuff like STV, BRM, and EPL which will last you years.
---
Well he wasn't a healer most of your run if he was in shadowform since all he could be doing is PWS...  unless he could heal the group solely off vampiric embrace.
---
That being said while leveling finishing mobs off with mindblast to proc spirit tap is probably the most OP thing priests can do.  If you can time it fairly reliably then you basically never need to drink as you have a mini-innervate up almost all the time.
---
July 16th is the only date with any corroborating evidence
---
in my guild if someone lets it slip they want to reroll they won't receive any gear on either character for the next 90 days until they re-prove their loyalty
---
It took me about 15 days usually . I was a very slow leveler (intentionally). 
---
No one is gonna trade theirs in since they know that they wont be available again, making them not so special anymore. I guess it kind of shows that you're a no-lifer who managed to make that much gold in that short amount of time i guess...
---
If you can be flagged for combat and stealth I will believe you.  Just because it has combat use and you use vanish to drop combat to enter stealth does not make it a combat usable ability. 
---
Warriors shouldn't use 2handed weapons in raids anyways. Even on horde one-handed outperforms 2h (Except for bonereavers edge)  
---
And sulfuras in and of itself is really bad as it takes up a debuff slot on the boss (dot)
---
They can't sell gold to gold farmers for as good of a price.
---
Considering every comment cites different numbers, it seems like nobody really knows, but could maybe be anywhere between 3-13%. Citation needed though. 
---
Agreed it is a good rage dump especially in raids as you don't really need white attacks at all for rage since you get most of it from getting hit.  In boss fights in raids you can usually use heroic strike exclusively instead of normal white hits just because of how much rage you are generating from the bosses damage.  In groups if I was at 60-70+ rage I would usually toss one in as well to burn some rage as it was good threat and increased dps as well which never hurts.
---
I loved watching this dudes videos, one of the first people who made wow guides.
---
Well it depends on your starting class as well, dont start with warrior to drop it later for an alt. Loss of a geared warrior is always a big deal for a guild as it takes a lot of time to gear them.
---
What's the most popular pvp class, and why?
---
Because they could arguably change the code they have.
---
You know, like closing the AQ gates.
---
What the plans are to solve any servers that are low-populated once/if the tourists leave.  I’m a bit paranoid that I’m going to roll on a server that’s promising to begin with, and by the time I’m 60 the population has gotten low
---
Oh for sure. People still complain about laid-out loot rules all the time. Like a hunter who left my guild for not getting Band of Accuria despite it being discussed it was tank prio before every rag kill.
---
Realm caps. It's the only thing that's make or brake to me. If they fold to the preassure of the private server community and make a huge change like that to the game and the community aspects I don't think I'll be playing. 
---
Hmmm interesting so even if its 12 days that's a bit better than i originally thought 
---
I definitely appreciate any input about my class choice!
---
Rogue is close to my heart cause I've mained it all the way from vanilla to bfa. I'm quite tempted to go gnome rogue like the first time and not go back. There are some things that worry me about rogue though, loot competition, respec/gold farming, not as good in BGs as other classes and overall not that strong in 1.12 especially post AQ. And in a way quite clunky compared to say a MoP rogue. But still feels fluid and fun for vanilla.
---
I never touched vanilla hunter in retail but fell in love with the hunter playstyle. Like a rogue it does quite well in wPvP and is also fun in all BGs. Good gold farmer, can get geared quickly and almost guaranteed to have at least Rokh'delar level weapon, interesting builds, interesting gameplay in PvP and PvE on paper at least. Bit worried about the reality of PvP though, with people constantly trying to abuse your deadzone. I also fear hunters suffer a lot from widespread use of potions/engi/skull from other classes, if someone jumps you with FAP and Skull it's tough. Add to that the scaling. They seem to do fine in Naxx gear though if I ever get there.
---
You'll notice both rogue and hunter have similarities, they're good classes for people who love pvp and also love solo gameplay outside of raid.
---
Then you have warrior, interesting playstyle, tank or dps, good in a group, the class for the full, social, vanilla experience. Worried about gold farming and solo pvp with bad gear though, that's why I asked about rolling a warrior as an alt - but then again I don't want to be that warrior in shit gear fighting people in T2.5 so that might be a poor idea. 
---
I see, hopefully closer to the 10
---
But all they are doing is releasing a game that was already made almost 20 years ago. How much credit do they really deserve...
---
I need to know what it feels like to play classic again
---
I used to do that all the time too! And then after you die, corpserun all the way back to your body along the tree to be able to continue. It took so long to get down. Fun memories indeed.
---
I've done something similar at least once before, but that was like 15 years ago using thotbott and missing some of the more obscure chains.  Just off the cuff, I'm counting 1680 quests for an Orc hunter, excluding battlegrounds, raids, and holidays.  If it takes 5 minutes per quest (admittedly low, but if we're talking GM powers...), that's about 6 days of played to time finish them all.  
---
Adjust the numbers a bit, and it becomes entirely a matter of Average Quest Time and how much time you can play during the day.
---
It was the panda's, be real
---
Well for one I simply want to have every quest completed on one character. I don’t want to do it on 2-4 different characters. I’m not sure how well this equates but I have done loremaster on retail 3 different times (all the way through). If I hit 60 before I finish my goal it is what it is and I’ll finish the rest of the quests at 60. 
---
If your main had some of the best pieces of gear then there will be some mistrust after you reroll. People do it all the time though so don't worry. 
---
PS. Hunters scale very well with gear. Not gonna be a problem for normal players. 
---
no thanks, i don't have kids 
---
I don't play on a server with any live streamers, but from what I've heard there's a few potential problems. Invasion of privacy (unwittingly ending up on someone's stream without knowing, especially in groups), annoying fans clogging up the server and drama when someone inevitably tries to ruin the streamer's day. Not to mention the risk of a huge influx when people stream, and then all those people leaving when the streamer inevitably moves to another game. 
---
I don't know how big an effect a streamer actually has on a server (and it definitely depends on what kind of streamer), but I guess it can be annoying. 
---
The code is not the data. They have the code but not the data.
---
Obviously, as Blizzard, they *could* decide they wanted to spend a lot of money on Classic, assign designers, artists, etc. And try and recreate some earlier version, even though they have lost the data. That's not what they are doing. It's in the video I linked.
---
Just 2 more :
---
A reconfirmation of sharding being temporary and limited for launch only and starter areas, and anything that confirms/infirms/changes the right-click reporting.
---
I fully expected this to be a guild application 😂
---
To me, it's usually about establishing a purpose. If you make your switch more about the guild than yourself, it will help others accept it with a lot less resistance. For instance, if you play a hunter early on, level an alt warrior but announce your intention of providing an additional tank for Naxx. In this way, you could keep your hunter as your "main" while allowing for your warrior to be geared as the tank for alt runs, as both would be getting utilized for progression eventually anyway.  
---
In my experience, many lead tanks hate farming raids solely for gathering mats or gearing other toons, despite often getting geared first/foremost as the guilds progress. Having an alt capable of handling this role could relieve a lot of tension/stress from your core players.  
---
Finally, many good GM's like to have a dedicated dps player or two with an alt tanking or healing class in the event one of their core players take vacation, quit the guild, or quit playing altogether. It's a win-win scenario, and often works in the best interests of everyone!
---
90 days? No thanks. Kick that guy.  
---
Only because companies understand player aren’t going to put down thousands of dollars every 2-3 years so they downgrade for older PCs. 
---
Ye its not gonna be that big but its not gonna be like "the old" client I reckon. Considering theyve rebuilt framework and all kinds of things. 
---
My uneducated guess would be like 8-10gb.
---
ok, remember that they are using modern servers and clients. They have the 1.12 data (which they have to normalize into the modern format), but AV has changed so much since 1.12 that it's unrealistic to think that just using data is enough to get the BG back to it's 1.12 state (in the server).
---
So they are almost certainly changing code, just like they almost certainly changed code to support the limited debuffs.
---
This type of thinking about your own enjoyment to the detriment of other people sense of community is what led wow to the shit hole it is today.
---
So because you dont have a lot of time to play per day you want instant queues ?
---
No sir, not this time. Guess you will have to wait for the weekend.
---
Cheers 
---
Sounds like you just want to play a warrior, so just make a warrior. Why make something knowing full well that you'd rather be something else? I'd say having a hunter alt is nice for farming and to spice up pvp, etc. Warriors are just amazing at nearly every aspect of the game (especially later on).
---
Thank fuck for most big streamers being NA. EU streamsniping in games like these is not really a thing from what Ive noticed, unless on a smaller level in comparison to Asmon/soda/shroud etc
---
&gt;Ah, right. An elitist.
---
A dumb take from what was otherwise a mundane post.
---
yeah, I suppose it may not be long enough I guess 
---
The problem is nazis and other scum of the earth roaming free in general chat in a game that children play. The online atmosphere is a lot more harsh than it was in 2005 and we need a way to silence people like that on the spot, not after a few days when a GM can get around to it. 
---
Don't spread the info I am planing to buy it from someone unaware of its true value :)
---
Yes 146 hours with GM powers, now try doing it where you have to kill mobs and travel, so maybe 5-600 hours of game play and thats just a single class on a single faction.  You havent included any raid quests or holiday events or indeed the DMF and AQ quest chain.  Have you included quests that start with an item drop?  
---
I am literally trying to explain to you this is simply not realistic when you are playing on a hopefully full server and having to do everything manually,  You want to spend 50+ days doing this on a single character then be my guest.  If you are doing it just for rep then there are FAR more efficient ways to get the factions exalted that are also more profitable.  
---
I am not trying to rain on your parade, I am trying to tell you this is a MUCH bigger task than you can imagine.  
---
They can choose whatever they want because they always have option to recreate stuff from scratch. Not sure if you are aware but they actually did all the patches in Vanilla by themselves so they are capable of doing WoW games. So they have now data what they use for base in Classic. They can then modify stuff as needed. You just want to think that they need to choose between existing data when in reality they can choose between using existing data &amp; recreating / modifying data. It's not like loot sharing in raids was in a patch 1.12 raids. Still they will have it in Classic because they "chose" to use it. 
---
Should be y’all got any of that release date. 
---
I'm in the same boat, but I am going with a PvE server, I feel like I need to make the most of my time and ganking/getting ganked is too low on my enjoyment list. I'm also trying to find a NA guild that finishes their raids by 10:30 EST and have had no luck so far, and I know I don't have time to start my own :/ It's gonna be quite the balancing act, but I'm sure we both will find like minded folks soon enough, good luck!
---
Server list with names and types. Most people seem to have a general idea of what they want to play and with who, so we really need the servers so people can start planning where they wanna go. It doesn't have to be exact and there can be changed at launch, but at least an approximate list of how it'll probably look. 
---
Second is the month they're planning to release it. Of course an exact date would be nice, but knowing if it's late or early summer would help considerably. 
---
How on Earth did you get appeoved? Teens have very little credit!
---
I definitely remember it being a thing for 5man dungeon whether end game or during leveling it was always called out and that persons name was usually tainted. 
---
Almost all bosses in level 60 dungeons are ?? which translates to level 63 so yes you will face it. Also there are 62 mobs , here is example  [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10371](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10371) ... plenty more.
---
With shield block and being almost naked you will push out crushing blow.
---
Slow weapon will generate more threat, I can't see how it can be better to have a fast weapon even with aoe tanking, you generate threat mostly with yellow attacks anyway, having 1 or 2 more white hits on a pack of mobs won't change your tanking, will just result in overall less threat. 
---
Great idea but I’m across the pond in the USA. I really don’t think that would be an issue as a whole the guild could encompass everyone from all time zones. You’d just log on and play with those on during your time to play. Would be a fun community depending on your Social system outside of the game (Forums/Discord) sharing and talking about things.
---
I’d be down to join this.
---
Well hitting 60 before it is completed just means I won’t get much out of it rewards wise, which is perfectly fine. If Classic lasts long enough (not sure why it wouldn’t with them just keeping servers online) I would for sure complete every quest available to my character. My biggest goal is to hit exalted with each faction by 60. I’m pretty sure it is possible without cloth turn ins but I guess I will find out.
---
It’s also true that battle groups were part of vanilla wow before BC you don’t need to be rude just because you disagree. 
---
I will make one and post the front and back here!
---
actually, they wont let you use copyrighted material. :(
---
Yes? What are we talking about exactly? :) I wasn't posting about that.
---
They have the old code, they are reintegrating it into the modern client/server as needed. That's how they create Classic. They have code for all the versions but only have data for 1.12, so Classic will be 1.12.
---
I posted because people plead and argue endlessly about why Blizzard "chose" 1.12 for some feature (most recently, AV). Like they could have chosen some other patch. They couldn't because they only have 1.12 data. But they wrote blue posts about "deciding" to go with 1.12. Which is weird.
---
How they're going to handle the future. 
---
Just upload TBC? Make a T4 vanilla raid. Just leave the Vanilla server along indefinitely?
---
Afraid copyrighted material is not allowed. I've tried.
---
It's 2019, we'll be playing a 15 year old game - that won't happen. As soon as it drops, people will just say "Siri, what is the average buyout price for Edgemaster's Handguards?"
---
Yeah they were added in the last patch  in preparation for TBC
---
Sticking to my claim. I can afford the downvotes.
---
You simply cannot do this due to class restrictions and faction restrictions.  You also cannot do this unless you also do the scarab lord Q chain, which you simply cannot do solo.  If you are willing to spend years on a character then you are more than welcome to try and achieve this, but there is no way of logging quests you may have missed and the yellow ! wont show any more so you need to be ticking them off a list.  You will hit 60 before you have even done 25% of the quests available, not to mention those gated behind content release periods and raid access.
---
As long as you are prepared to invest the time and want to do this then I say good luck to you, I am just trying to demonstrate how difficult this will be EVEN with all the resources available and almost unlimited time.  Hopefully there will be years for players to achieve this, but it will be taking you literally years and for very little benefit if any at all.
---
I think, overall, that’s quite a lot of tools to help the group out, don’t you? Banish, summon, and soul stone alone would make it worth bringing a lock.
---
It's like 50g an hour grinding mobs and vendoring grey items with skinning. It's not that bad of a grind to say someone is " no life"
---
Later vanilla had cross realm battlegroups so I'm positive it will be in.
---
I didn't mind flying in Wrath because at least the zones you first got flying in were at least built for it (Storm Peaks, Icecrown) but I loathe how they allowed flying in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms with a passion. It might be silly, but playing in BFA and flying through at 310% flight speed just makes the world feel so tiny, in combination with portals being widespread.
---
Well don't you look like a dumbarse now that blizzard listened to the feedback and made changes for the better. 
---
Had it been your way classic would've sucked just as much as you currently do. 
---
Indeed. Cata was where I stopped. The game just wasnt fun anymore. A lot of quit knowing everything would just reset and it would be the same gring all over again only to have it ruined by yet another expansion.
---
Hobbes was a fucking baller. The king of all vanilla and tbc protadins.
---
I really enjoy your show man
---
Why?
---
I really like this answer.
---
Is this will full gear or fresh 60 greens?
---
You are mistaken sir, I used to bounce mobs in dungeons with fear to peel in oh shit situations and curse of reck to keep them going back and forth, the initial second is guaranteed running in the opposite direction, if that is not the case on a particular server then that is simply an error in scripting on their part.
---
The data for earlier AV is known and can be recreated. Blizz has been working on this game for 2 years. They could arguably choose to recreate a 1.8 AV if they really wanted to. 
---
They "chose" not to do so and instead stick with the much more straightforward plan of using 1.12.
---
When they use the word "chose", you see it as Blizzard somehow being deceptive because they really had no choice in the first place. But I see it as Blizzard saying they had the capability to make the change if they felt it was warranted. 
---
Not having at least one RP-PVP server at launch
---
Your point on getting ganked is definitely valid. I like the world PVP element of Tarren Mill etc and for me it's all part of the nostalgia but after reading this I think you may be right and this time around I'll spend half my available play time corpse walking..
---
Even though I think the people advocating for single server BGs have a legitimate argument, personally I think cross-realm BGs are better for the overall health of PvP.
---
It's 2019 and a lot of people coming from retail are playing a 15 year old game and still don't have a clue on how to use the AH most of them undercut people like monsters for a "quick" sale, Hell my friend does it and i've known him since cata and he claims he started in TBC.
---
People will see zero stats and + weapon skill and think it's trash or throw it up there for quick cash.
---
I have nothing against anyone joining from anywhere across the world, but if there are going to be NA and EU server options, those in NA playing on EU will potentially have a worse experience in general. Or maybe it will be better with less competition etc. If you're down for trying then you can be recruit number 1 haha!
---
It was nerfed earlier in like 1.8
---
What's up with the name? A most of the players I've met who identify themselves as parents are women. Especially with babies they tend to be the ones at home on leave, or the primary guardians in the case of divorce.
---
Not a parent btw, I've just been in a lot of parent-heavy guilds.
---
Of course they *could* try and recreate whatever they chose. They have the money and it's their game.
---
But I *highly* doubt they would want to. Classic is a small project with few people on the team. They are doing it *because* it's a small investment with a guaranteed quite large payoff. They won't start pouring resources into it. (If it turns out to be a big success, things might change but not before.)
---
Also, in the very same video I linked they went to pains to emphasize it's a recreation, not a reimagination. They said that it's "not their game to change" and they'll hold the data "almost sacrosanct". They talked a lot about not having the data earlier and then recovering (some of) it and how they'll use it. If they could just recreate it, why would they go to great lengths to do that?
---
Also, recreating lost data of this kind is basically impossible. You can get something similar if you put in the time and effort but it'd never be the same. Especially if large parts of the game are given and you want to add or change small parts. It'd be a very large undertaking and for what? That wouldn't be the quality and results they are after.
---
They work with what data they have and that's it.
---
If I'm waiting for 15 mins every BG just go into losing BGs due server pop/faction balance or time zones I wont pvp or I'll move servers. I'm sure other people will too. 
---
Queue times.
---
Everything else is basically the same.
---
When he says days he means playtime on your character.  I think I had around 7days /played before I hit 60. 
---
I know you’re talking about hardcore players, but I would like to note that I’d never recommend this playstyle for casual or new players. You’d get bored/burn out in the 25-45 range SO easily just killing mobs for 200 hours.
---
It's not about the hit, it's about the glancing blow mitigation on raid mobs.
---
Investors listen to numbers, and when blizzard does their quarterly report there's a reason they stopped reporting their subscriber count and started focusing on revenue. It quickly became about new revenue streams instead of sub counts for investors... they don't demand for pandas but expect growing revenue, leading to lootboxes, ingame shops and other money generating features that we all have come to blame for the downturn in WoW. The game might die in their eyes, but at least they made some money on the way out.
---
So if I had those exact specs. I can play vanilla wow? Honestly I think it might be more expensive to find those parts than to buy a PC from 2009 
---
Nah, it is not that difficult to recreate stuff for professionals. It is pretty safe to assume that data structures itself didn't change too much between patches, only values. To some extend pretty accurate recreation isn't toi much of a work.
---
I loved the immersion and suspense of a RP-PVP realm. I’ll be really bumped out if they don’t bring those back.
---
I distinctly remember running through Strangletorn Vale on my level 34 dwarf paladin and fearing &lt;The Second Gurubashi Empire&gt;, a troll only guild, was patrolling the main road as they usually did. Before I knew it, I saw three trolls on their impressive raptor mounts, strawlin' at walking speed. The moment they saw me, they rushed head on towards me. I had nowhere to go. 
---
After they were corpse camping me for a while, I got fed up and called in the help of my dwarven brethren of &lt;The Dwarven Rifle Squad&gt;. I still remember the glorious sight of those small bastards on their rams rushing over the hilltop to come to my aid. 
---
You just don’t get these situations on either PvP or RP realms… You distinctly need RP-PvP
---
Please blizzard, I beg you, give us a RP-PvP realm (preferably at launch).
---
Doesn't really make sense for the base to be 1.12 and AV and version before that.
---
Read the post and you'll see for yourself :)
---
Yup.
---
Battlegroups help mitigate server imbalances as well as drastically improving queue times and types of BG available. This is especially true for the various twink brackets, since 4 servers is obviously going to have more people to PvP with. I love the 49 bracket, and am planning on having at least a couple of 49 twinks to PvP with. Single-server BGs would make that much harder.
---
Overall I just think there are more advantages to cross-realm BGs than there are disadvantages.
---
its more because the advancement of computer hardware slowed down after the we hit dual cores and DDR3
---
Pservers don't have skewed quest rewards that shit was fixed over a year ago...
---
As a raider for over a decade, avoid raiding with parents also. I'm sure they have every intention to come to raid and be there for 4 hours, but kids definitely do NOT have that plan as well.
---
Sorry this is slanted against those who have kids, but I do like OPs idea as parents will be much more understanding than a guild of NEETs like mine
---
they probably still have the 7.0 api version in version control, which is what classic will be based on, so hopefully yes
---
It's about both, the extra comp gives u 3%hit wich reduces the amount of glancing blow
---
Same. Was in Kingship if the East for WotLK and wpvp battles were more or less a daily thing. Flying mounts made it pretty dynamic because everyone had a "Fuck it, we're going in" attitude.
---
Most likely there will be eventually, but don't expect any news on what addons are going to be made for/support classic until they release more news on how the addon api is going to work.
---
Didn’t realize 1.12 was the last patch....
---
“Battlegrounds are shared between multiple servers where their players can engage in PvP against other realms. Each group of realms is called a Battlegroup. Battlegroups were introduced in Patch 1.12”
---
So now with that nugget got anymore arguments or are you just full of shit. 
---
The data is not known, unless you are meaning "in people's memory and youtube videos". That's the whole point of "they have only 1.12 data because earlier data was lost".
---
As for recreating things, I'd just repeat this: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4hpic/blizzard_only_has_112_data_why_do_they_pretend/ej6xbj4/
---
They are being deceptive, maybe unintentionally. They were very public with their limitations in the video I linked so I think this is unintentional. They just don't think every angle completely through. You can see the result in all the arguments on this subreddit.
---
I don't think Blizzard will like seeing all the famous streamers on twitch sitting in long queues. The player cap will probably be over 10k. The people will inevitably leave though so it's a good way to stop some servers from becoming dead.
---
TBH i worry about this. In my adult life i am so bad at finding people to play games with. I am really hoping i meet some people along the leveling journey that will take me in. 
---
WoW went downhill when Trial of the Crusader was released, then fell off a cliff when cross-realm dungeon finder released. 
---
They briefly made some positive steps with Cata dungeon difficulty, but then ruined it by catering to all the whiny babies who didn't have the skill or patience to complete them.
---
That sounds more reasonable. Also keep in mind that compression algorithms for texture and audio have made big progress since 2004, so I really don't think it should be anything bigger than 8GB.
---
They were implemented during 1.12 please don’t keep spreading misinformation. 
---
I would say it’s definitely feasible to switch halfway. A hunter makes a great first character and a warrior makes a great 2nd; hunter can plow through levelling, basically being OP until 60; at 60 you’re still vital to 10, 20, and 40 man groups (no one wants to do UBRS without a hunter). 
---
You can farm very efficiently, that gold can fuel your warrior (or any other alt) through levelling and preraid gearing. Which is expensive if you want to do it well - lionheart helm, devilsaur leather etc
---
\&gt; PvE players making trains, PvP players screaming about sucking dick
---
sounds about right tbh
---
sad to see how few abilities remain :/ 
---
What is the extent of addon functionality being available.
---
The blizzard UI isn't good enough for most people. Being able to see enemy cast bars/monster health is also nice.
---
how bad was it to have to hand out health stones? I don't remember wow before locks had the cookie table. Am I going to want a trade addon for this in raids?
---
That and also that most game releases also started to be released across multiple platforms. So PC releases to a certain degree also got tied into the limitations of the current generation of console.
---
1.12 was the last patch though
---
You can just type /ignore &lt;name&gt; 
---
right click ignoring was introduced some time early tbc, and they could keep that part but not the reporting. 
---
It's far from as bad as having to give food and water to the entire raid. It is rarely that the entire raid needs HS. It's mainly going to be for the tanks, shouldn't take to mutch time/shards.
---
Would be awesome to have several shards for the same server you can chose in the realm selection screen. Your homies could join the same shard and there won't be any whacky phasing going on. You can also dictate which realms will be high population based on the amount of shards that are provided.
---
Make the contested zones inaccessible until you switch to a certain shard to prevent abuse.
---
I'm a professional game developer. :) Please watch the video. They also talk about those data structures.
---
One of the recently fired Blizzard CMs talked about that he got to know that Blizzard started working on Classic even before they met with the Nostalrius team. That was in 2016. They have been working on Classic for years now. Not only this is not a trivial task, they can't and won't be satisfied with a "pretty accurate recreation". They are not private server developers. Just "recreating" it based on memories and youtube videos won't cut it for them. :)
---
probably, you can't be a trendy super serious raider without it
---
&gt;You could just admit you made a mistake
---
How about you learn english? I Never claimed Classic would **use** the 1.12 client, I wrote it would be **based upon** it you dork.
---
Hello my Fellow RP-Comrades, i bring news from the blizzard forums. My OP has over 94 likes and 130 so people in comments agreeing, If you have an account, support it or like it something it does show. You do not need a sub to post in the classic forums only general.

---
I don’t watch classicast. I just think the game is mostly people looking to have fun and not hardcore raiders
---
No 2.0.3 was the last patch because that’s when they introduced all of the talents etc for BC. Also wow classic is being developed off of the 1.12 patch so here you are arguing for #changes in a #nochanges area. 
---
There is nothing to be afraid of. I personally quit after Wraith and I've recently picked up vanilla and been casually playing it. I converse with hc and semi-hc raiders, especially officers, they all have been helpful, nice and honest.
---
myeah don't expect raiding to work 
---
it should be fine tho for collecting dungeon sets which is pretty good for pvp
---
 I loved the immersion and suspense of a RP-PVP realm. I’ll be really bumped out if they don’t bring those back.

I was probably 20 at the time? I was 2nd or 3rd year of college at that point.
---
I shudder thinking what prices there will be for items that like that
---
The creator allready confirmed he would make it.
---
The 500 MB of RAM are quite high. I definitely started to play with 256MB.
---
&gt; People will see zero stats and + weapon skill and think it's trash or throw it up there for quick cash.
---
and some AH camper will take them all and resell for way more than they should be worth
---
3-4 weeks
---
If that's true, that's awesome news. Do you have a link to that post?
---
Those minimum requirements were actually insufficient to run the game smoothly. I remember that you had to have about double the RAM to not get stutters/lag after a while.
---
they will be the first to burn out
---
Absolutely. The RAM especially.
---
This would require playing at least 18 hours a day on the most optimal leveling routes possible.
---
Hard pass 
---
Zug zug!
---
[second link googling it](https://www.tukui.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4282).  
---
Its a strength, not a chore. At least in my book. Giving random people healthstones is fun, doing it in raids is just something to do during trash.
---
But muh community 
---
Ya but no one wants 30 min ques for a crappy bg
---
Pretty much this. Vanilla was 500+ for me and then bc/lk was when I first saw sub 200.
---
I now get 3ms to oce servers. I don't want to go back to anything else. Lol.
---
On my only lvl 60 in retail vanilla, I took my sweet time. 25 days played, and that was a hunter. 
---
You may not play that way but there are pvp rewards that people will grind out just for those not because they enjoy pvp. 
---
It was the last major patch. Classic is being developed off of 1.12 because that's the information blizzard has to work with and because things like talents and tuning are changing patch to patch. Whereas things like BGs were server only for 90% of vanilla and then at the end they changed the system to accommodate future expansions. You're arguing with me about semantics, there is a clear choice about which one is truly vanilla and which one isn't.
---
Hi. This is a classic wow sub. “Back then,” doesn’t mean three expansions after classic... lmao 
---
I bet with all the much higher resolution textures and legion based back end of the game, its probably going to be around 30gb. Even then, that's still small enough for me to RAM DISK classic to have instant load times.
---
Note to self: buy more memory, m.2 not fast enough.
---
Celeron is such a weird trademark. At times they were horrible, stripped-down versions of the current gen; better alternatives to the Atom series; basically an Atom with just a little bit of L3 cache added; or a quite capable budget CPU outperforming the new "Pentium"s.
---
I'd have to go into wiki to see how 2004's Celerons fared, but I'm going to take your word for it. And if that means that they were built on the Pentium 3 Mobile, well, so was Core 2 Duo, that's a good sign.
---
&gt; gold farming
---
they can do brd pickpockets runs, rfd disenchant runs with herbalism, stealth runs in mara for ghost mushrooms ( up to 10x a run)  or just farm bats and worms in EPL especially if u got skinning or any gathering tbh. It should be good enough gold, right?
---
&gt;nobody really knows 
---
It's not like nobody really knows, there are many different important factors like gear, world buffs, single/multitarget fight etc. and they all yield different results. It would be bad to dumb it down to a single number.
---
...because they're cool and people like them? I couldn't care less what other people use as mounts, I just want my Mottled Red Raptor, especially since there's no replacement for it on Retail like there is for the Ivory Raptor.
---
Modern Windows requires hardware features not available back then, I'm quite sure. With a build that old, I think it would be easier to run it under Linux with Wine. That works perfectly though.
---
Realistically it’ll take you between 3-5 months of playing nightly and at weekends. You can totally do it a lot quicker but your likely to spend a good amount of time procrastinating to an extent with battle grounds, forming dungeon groups, surfing the auction house and trying to make gold for your mount. 
---
Now if you’re super hard core, two weeks is a good benchmark for the real world time but you’ll be burned out by the end. 
---
On the other hand if you’re a parent with responsibility 5-9 months not a bad benchmark is either because your more likely to set yourself goals to achieve which will helps to speed up the level process. 
---
pretty sure it's just a recruiting tactic
---
theres already pfUI though which is literally like the same thing so
---
And you clearly have no idea why sharding is a problem, how it ruins server communities which is the biggest part of Vanilla.
---
Fair point. I want to be hardcore but my kids won't let me :( 
---
It's nice to see the content release plan updated. I am neutral on the loot trading thing as it is an improvement but I would still prefer no loot trading at all. Putting zerg style AV into Classic is straight up tone deaf. It has been a mixed bag.
---
tons of them because xrealm is shit and was clearly a mistake, that's as much legitimacy as I'm going to offer this garbage bait post 
---
I formed many many many ubrs groups myself because I wanted the hunter breast and I always set master loot before finale boss but was. Open about it. Worked very well. Just have people roll. This way I was sure there would be ninja looting and  people were completely fine with it.
---
Reeee I want it my way or you can go back to retail reeee. 2.0.3 was the last major patch of vanilla you can disagree that’s your oppinion. It introduced the BC talents while you can argue all day about not wanting Battlegroups they were a part of 1.12 so I disagree. 
---
You know why battle groups got introduced because obscene que times on low to mid population servers. Not to accommodate some future expansion. They were introduced to address the issue players in vanilla had with que times especially on lower population servers. So while in your perfect world your okay with obscene que times obviously blizzard wasn’t or they wouldn’t have implemented a system to resolve it in 1.12 you know the patch classic is being built off of. 
---
Well i am professional software engineer and know that with the amount of data available only from videos from the game professional reverese engineers could make pretty amazing iteration of any patch in vanilla. Now when you have data and data structures for one iteration of the game you have pretty amazing starting point. Then you add the fact that there is still people working on blizzard / are available for blizzard who were working with original Vanilla. Amount of consultation they propably get is pretty good also. Not sure what kind of people and projects you work with but this isn't really rocket science. Professional people don't see problems, they find solutions. Recreating a modified iteration of a game with amount of data available what WoW haves it really isn't impossible for professionals. It is only matter of will / need to do it.
---
Yep, sounds like a Preston. 
---
no with kings you fool!
---
What will server population caps be? If it's mega-server levels then inevitably sharding will leak out into the rest of the game world. Having a low pop cap is critical to Classic's authenticity.
---
They can merge the very low pop realms. I'm sure nobody wants to play on a 100 player realm
---
Pretty easy to lie when you've deleted the evidence.
---
This is creepy tbh
---
Clearly says raiding isn't a thing in this guid. Thanks for the input 
---
Oh really? You do realize that each and every health stone required a soul shard? And that you could only have 1 health stone in your inventory at a time? So there was no way to build up a stock of the darn things during idle periods. And if you ran out of soul shards, you in turn limited your other abilities such as summoning any demon except for the imp.
---
This is very pleasing news and solved the situation perfectly.
---
I can't remember when, but I specifically remember fear being changed to cause targets to run away from you instead of randomly running around. I mained warlock from Vanilla to MOP and in Vanilla they definitely ran around randomly.
---
Yes, but if you were actually THERE you would have noticed that pretty much everything was still 100% classic. Only people who only read old patch notes, and play on pservers think of 2.0x as anything other than more classic.
---
You are thinking very small if you think they introduced cross realm BGs just because of queue time. They could've just merged servers if that was the case. They did it so they could have server groups for arenas where there wasn't a limiting factor of a couple thousand people per server.
---
RIP Totalhalibut, my favorite troll mage
---
oh gosh i hope all the high and migthys have an orgy on 1 specific server n buggers off on the rest.
---
???????????????????????????????????????????
---
1.12 was 1 month, and 2.03 was 1 month. It was classic, and most guilds that did cleared naxx in 2.03.
---
There's no way I'm staying engaged with all the classic I'll be playing.
---
My fiancee won't have it.
---
They probably played on a server with que times to login. They could have just been trained to expect everything to have 30 minute que times. 
---
AKA late in vanilla's lifecycle
---
I do. But as I said you don't need to make 40 of them. Mybe 3 to 5 for your entire raid.
---
If you run out of shards at the start of your raid you have other issues.
---
No one is arguing that Battlegroups weren't in vanilla. People are arguing that they came so late (1.12), that they should no way be in the game until then or around phase 6. It has nothing to do with #nochanges.
---
The people saying stuff like "well it was in vanilla in 1.12, so therefore it should be in the game!"... yes but not before that point. It would be like "well Naxx was in the game since 1.11, and we are getting 1.12 base, so Naxx should be in at launch!!" Literally same thing, except we aren't getting Naxx at launch, we are getting it in its respective phase (how it should be). See how dumb this is?
---
1.12 is just being used as a BASE, where blizzard is making decisions on when to add content in via phases to capture the essence of vanilla, and I hate to break it to you, but crbgs/battlegroups aren't that. If blizz does decide on crbgs/battlegroups, then hopefully it is on such a small scale that it doesn't effect balanced servers.
---
It would be nice if blizz could figure out a way so they wouldn't have to implement crbgs/battlegroups, but that probably won't happen.
---
That's what I said a few posts before. They *could* if they *really* wanted. But at this point I think we really got lost in the bogs, veered too far from the original point. I don't think there is anything to add.
---
\*then
---
This used to be how I felt. Now I’ll wait till they do it twice in a row, this hit and miss is annoying.
---
Windfury too fast for health bars mang
---
LMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAO PROVEI TH ASHFAHSFHSDAEGHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Your literally arguing against a feature included in 1.12. So #changes got it then let’s implement some class changes to. 
---
Still in vanilla. 
---
Yep. On my server we didn't have AV. For a couple months Horde lost literally every AV match. It was a meme to the point where people just sat and let the Alliance plow through. Then people stopped queuing. Eventually you just couldn't play AV outside of a premade, which still didn't really happen because the opposing faction would also need a premade.
---
&gt; Leveling up to 60? Warrior is the most gear dependent
---
tho they have the easiest time getting their pre-raid bis
---
That's a lot of effort just to stay optimal on meters - especially considering that Fury Wars and Rogues are likely to be a dime-a-dozen. I guess the questions is, do you think you'll be geared and skilled enough on your alt to warrant the GM picking you over someone else's main?
---
I guess I can't see slogging through weeks of MC, Ony, and BWL just to drop my char in favor of something else. I'd just start as a War and prove yourself through the bad times with the other Furys.
---
There's no "exact" amount.
---
Weapon skill has two main effects.
---
1. When the difference between your weapon skill and the enemy's defense is more than 10, your chance to miss increases significantly (from 6% vs lvl 62 mobs, to 9% to lvl 63 mobs). Bosses have 315 defense as if they were lvl 63, so getting to 305 weapon skill is equal to 3% hit.
---
2. Reduced glancing blow damage. 40% of your hits against level 63+ mobs will be glancing blows. These attacks deal less damage. Weapon skill increases this amount. The first points add more glancing damage than the last ones. Not sure if this formula is accurate, but in the most popular pserver it's: 
---
- 300 = 65% damage.
---
- 305 = 85% damage.
---
- 310 = 95% damage.
---
- 315 = 100%.
---
Formula might be off, but the idea is the same: the first 5 points are the most important.
---
It also adds some extra itemization options. Human warriors can get the AQ +4 mace skill mace. Non-humans can't use it very effectively, since they wouldn't reach those first 5 skill points.
---
Human warriors also get to replace edgemasters earlier on.
---
For pvp it doesn't matter. 
---
For level 60-62 mobs it doesn't really add that much.
---
For rogues it's honestly not a big deal since they have +5 skill from talents. Non-human rogues can get maladath as an off-hand and reach 309 skill, or just go daggers.
---
For dps warriors against bosses it's very significant. More autoattack damage also generates more rage, and therefor more ability damage.
---
Expect human warriors to have earlier "power spikes" when they replace gear earlier than non-humans, but with the same gear, they'd do maybe 5-10% more damage in a raid depending on the boss duration, adds, etc.
---
Honestly it's not such a huge deal, but non-humans will get lower loot priority on certain items and the gap will grow. That's IMO the worst thing about it.
---
Pretty sure you didn't get EXP until Wrath
---
&gt;Wrath of the Lich King Patch 3.2.0 (2009-08-04):
---
&gt;Battleground experience has arrived!
---
Players will now be awarded experience for completing objectives and actions that yield honor in Battlegrounds (honorable kills not included).
---
Well I'm sure you're having a pleasant time writing paragraphs about how impossible you think this is by being either pedantic about what "all quests" means or your anecdotes of how you spent a bunch of time messing around with gm powers.  
---
Can you read?
---
All I'm saying is that what he said wasn't "misinformation." 
---
Fairly sure this is incorrect. I was a twink and you never leveled until Wrath and then you had the option to turn off XP. 
---
People love to redig sharding topic every single day every fucking where huh? Goddamn
---
He is kinds wrong. They don't, however quests gives you exp which is what he means. You cant stop exp on twinks, so if bgs gave exp twinks wouldnt exist :p
---
Take a look at Lethlore Ravine in Vanilla. It's in the eastern edge of the Badlands. Now at the southern end of that Ravine is a circular area with a LOT of elite level 41 to 43 dragons. A good warlock at level 40 can easily solo the level 41 and 42 dragons ... NAKED. Yes, no gear equipped at all. No trinkets. No potions. Nothing. Just the warlock and his minion killing elites. When the warlock reached level 41, then all the dragons there become fair prey.
---
Now think about attempting to do that with any other class. Mages? Nope. Hunters? With gear they can, but naked? Nope. Priests? Nope. No other class is capable of doing it. Try it sometime. And don't worry about repair costs. After all, you won't have any, since when you die, you'll be naked.
---
How do you do it? The hint is in the warlock motto... "It's it's fearable, it's killable."
---
He streams Hearthstone on Twitch if anyone is interested in keeping up with him. 
---
I am trying to save people doing something for no reason.  If you want to do every quest then you have a reason.  If you honestly think that completing every quest available is something you want to do, then I am trying to prepare you for how long it will take.  I tried to give you advice based on experience, if you choose to ignore it then be my guest.
---
It’s strange but you might need some bfa to appreciate classic. I’d say try bfa in the meantime. 
---
Nah, were just saying that Battlegroups were a mistake and shouldn't have been added in the first place. 
---
Yeah just for extra clarification since everyone is using days as a measurement: 12 days = 288 hours playtime
---
If you average let's say 12 hrs a week you're looking at around 20-30 calendar days.
---
I was on a high pop server where the AV community died completely due to a huge skill imbalance. You literally couldn't play AV. Nobody queued for it. 
---
It will happen, just look at PoE races. When new leagues comes out all the pros rush to be first lv 100 which takes a bit less than a week. They usually go for more than 18 hours a day... Some goes for 24-36 hours without sleep the first day then 4 hours of sleep the days after.
---
Yeah nothing builds server communities like being stuck on a quest for hours because there are tens of people hunting the same mobs that drop a quest item 10% of the time.
---
Until we get real definitions on what 'casual' and 'hardcore' mean then we can start drawing lines in the sand but let it be said that 'casual'=/='bad' and 'hardcore'=/=good.
---
It's super effective!
---
That would be nice. But what I really wished was that soul shards were named with the name of the mob (or player) that was killed in the creation of the soul shard. Just imagine the possibilities.
---
Some warlocks would keep trophy bags of shards.
---
Some warlocks would taunt enemy players with shards from prior kills.
---
etc.
---
If you have any sort of route at all, 175 hours isn’t crazy on any class. Joanas time was like 126 hours and people are getting close to 3 day speed runs on private servers. Not that getting anywhere near that is even feasible for the average player but if you’re actually trying you can easily do 175 hours which is like 7.3 days. As long as you’re actively leveling and not fucking around you’ll be able to get sub 200 even without a route but you’ll probably be doing quite a bit of grinding.
---
I doubt we will hear anything about battlegrounds until we approach the phase 2 content release. 
---
Nope sure can’t. but If 1.12 is the base they are building classic from why do you shouldn’t expect blizzard to not include Battlegroups. 
---
Yes, it means they can "choose" to make whatever iteration / modification they need. They are not tied to use only existing data because they aren't capable to do anything by themselves because it would be somehow impossible or difficult for them. It is just matter of time / will / need or some other reasoning if they make modifications or not. You want to make it it sound like they don't really choose between different options but instead are forced to use only data they have from 1.12. That is already been proven wrong by the changes that Classic will have that weren't part of that patch. Case closed.
---
Xrealm got me to actually play pvp because beforehand que times on my mid population realm has become a problem. 
---
You could start by finding blue posts. That could clear a lot of things up for you.
---
Relatively high for 2004, yes.
---
it addresses a symptom of a real problem, population imbalance, faction specifically, and it was necessary for arenas to function
---
without arenas they should work on maintaining faction balance and not only does the symptom go away, the game is better as a whole for everyone 
---
Nobody gives a shit if you want to tryhard. 
---
Nobody gives a shit if you play casually.
---
All of this strawmanning needs to stop. Seems like victimizing yourself is the only way people know to get attention these days.
---
Heh, same, I played retail BC on a really shitty laptop with an integrated graphics card, and got a smooth 10fps anywhere out in the world. Was glad every time I went into a house and I jumped up to 25fps!
---
It's not everyone. It's jus a couple people making these divisive memes.
---
No I’m thinking I’d like to be able to actually spend more time in battlegrounds rather than spend my time waiting to get in battle grounds. 
---
Guys honestly I don't think they are doing anything special. They are just recreating an old game and they should know that add features from retail wow is wrong. They just have to recreate the extact copy of vanilla, without adding shit.
---
The creepy human looking choo-choo train orgasm face dude...
---
I agree with you. Idk what it was during vanilla but queues for battlegrounds never took long at any level. On private servers they take forever and are almost nonexistent for any bracket besides 60. Back then people weren't so focused on getting to cap and min-maxing. PVP was a big part of the game at any level.
---
Nah that's wrong, you get some from the mobs you kill too. Which you won't see as a twink, because you often had a max level character grouped with you in said dungeon (to prevent xp gains and to go faster.) 
---
I respect your guild a lot for that. 
---
Actually I'm very wrong, I raid dungeons for some reasons. 
---
prolly most of the legion version addons will work in classic
---
I'm exfremly wrong I misread what he said. You're right. 
---
I'm probably just stupid but I don't understand these poll questions.
---
Hmm, what's a solution to that? Grouping and making friends? Nah, that couldn't possibly work, nor build a community.
---
Meanwhile nothing kills a community like a barren empty world where you don't interact with anyone. If you want your empty sharded world, play retail.
---
"hey guys, hobbs here"
---
I think a better wording of the poll is: “Select all of the following that you believe break the role-play immersion on an RP realm”
---
Sap is a stun i think? So yes you can.
---
You don't rp all the time man, just in /s /y and in some guilds. No one's getting mad you said "cc that mob"
---
Wouldn’t help can’t read apparently my oppinion doesn’t matter all the “true” vanilla players obviously know better than me. 
---
What does any of that have to do with BGs?
---
They still haven’t fixed population imbalance in the live game what makes you think the classic team will do any better especially since population imbalances exsisted during vanilla. 
---
zero incentive to fix population imbalances in a game of xrealm everything and sharding, it literally doesn't matter at all 
---
Funny, I have them all shifted one spot.
---
Num0 = Skull 
---
Num1 = X 
---
Etc.
---
I love just spamming them over people's heads when they are AFK or not paying attention and see how long it takes them to notice. 
---
Warrior has great CC, it's called tanking  LOL...
---
I...never said that. Vanilla Wow looks great to me, but to the average PC player that obsesses over graphical capabilities, it sure as hell does not hold up when compared to newer titles.
---
What advice?  Your comments thus far have been "Don't do it/You'll never do it.  It will take a long time."  
---
Yea that will work until your name gets circulated. Would work great on retail, not so much when everybody knows each other
---
sure, let's have the healer heal the tank and the dps warrior who is doing CC by off-tanking. That's so much better than a mage sheeping a mob.
---
you need mental help
---
Use to watch his hearthstone videos everyday. Love his personality. 
---
&gt;I guess the questions is, do you think you'll be geared and skilled enough on your alt to warrant the GM picking you over someone else's main? 
---
Not sure, he could indeed find a more geared warrior than my alt, but my alt is supposed to take my main's spot in the raid. If he's not going to take my alt then I won't reroll, so he would have to bench my main to make room for that geared warrior, lol. Ideally my GM wouldn't bench a hunter just because of scaling, but I guess the question is would you like to replace one of your hunters by a harder-scaling class?
---
You make good points though, about proving yourself, cause it's really what is with warriors in early content. I guess the thing with hunters is that you peak with BWL gear, if you have T2/xbow you're pretty much set for PvP until Naxx beside a few pieces. So I could potentially continue to play the hunter in PvP. 
---
LOREWALKER CHO
---
Got it don’t do crossrealms have faith blizzrd will keep the faction populations balanced. Because their track record on that front is great said no one ever. 
---
If you're that impatient then honestly maybe classic isn't right for you, there is A LOT of waiting around.
---
They wanted battlegroups so that you had more people to enter arena with instead of just a few thousand from your server.
---
As far as I know sap is an incapacitation effect and cannot be removed with any insignia. Only warriors with berserker rage can remove it. 
---
You mean, to plan divorce date and tell ur boss u cant work anymore?
---
Wotlk was where WC3 ended so it makes sense i guess.
---
Cata had very enjoyable dungeon experience, and having a giant dragon as the main villain was attractive enough to keep me playing, however it started to lose the warcraft feel.
---
pretty awesome! I remember in vanilla I didn't even get tier 0 really because it just never dropped for me so I eventually had full tier 1/2 and didn't need to get tier 0. But I never had the opportunity to do the 0.5 quests so I just might make it a point to do that in classic.
---
&gt; after the patch I’ve never seen anyone from my server again.
---
What? When they first introduced CR BGs they used battle groups of 3-4 servers. 
---
Are you saying in every WSG group you were in that all 9 players would be from the other 3 servers every time? The odds of that are so low you literally can’t not be lying. 
---
It really sucks when people just make shit up to support their argument. It makes it look like people go are actually upset for a reason look delusional.
---
It’s one thing to not want something in a game. But if you have to lie about it what’s the point.
---
First point of the video claims the game is Rock paper scissors ?  Its rock paper scissors mushroom.  
---
And when the rock hits 60 and cannot find paper because paper is invisible.
---
Can you? Of course you can
---
Will it be easy? That depends massively on your reputation and standing with your guild
---
While gear lasts longer in progressive raid designs vs the current seasonal raid design on retail a character with a lower raid gear status can definitely contribute.
---
Though with the sparsity on certain areas you should keep in mind that this wall cause a lot of drama and bad blood. Even more so when your first toon has absorbed some of the strongest/rarest items out of the big mixed classes loot.  
---
Or to bring up an extreme example. Let's say you have the only Thunderfury of your guild and then you want to reroll. Good luck with that.
---
How close minded can you be? Jfc. You literally are unable to have a conversation. I asked if you could read because you obviously didn't read the post you replied to.
---
yellow items are hit gear
---
I’m not married so there’ll be less fallout when I break up with my girlfriend.  Not that it will bother me when I’m adventuring in Azeroth. 
---
But yes, I have a three month notice period at work which is now seeping into summer time so i’m getting worried.  Might have to fake my death instead which requires a bit more planning. 
---
Haha tricky 
---
And here I amd hoping for 450GB ultra HD texture packs
---
The advice that your are seriously underestimate the time investment required. The fact that you continue to argue for no damn reason shows your probably that much of a stubborn ass you will likely achieve all your dreams of completing every quest available just to say you have done it. 
---
Hold on so I’m impatient for not wanting an hour long as que just to get in a 20 minute Zerg the boss AV pvp match? Is that what your saying. Because your damn right I think that’s a problem. 
---
Ekhem, for Horde you have portal to Stonard that mage can provide.
---
They are bringing back CoT portal but Uldum wasnt that far away. 
---
However I can agree with "they cannot make retail harder or more classic since expectations are already set for it" but they can always if classic is success alter it's story and make it better wow not puny copy of their mistakes from past. For example they also could ask Metzen and make game with his original concepts and ideas which were great. They have money and resources to do this now not like in past. 
---
Just woke up and one of the first things I did was open Reddit holding my breath hoping for another Blue Post. Instead I got a Dave C. crack meme. Every day can't be Christmas.
---
Not too many people really like the look, just that they're rare and special. 
---
I remember trinketing it one time in TBC (not Vanilla, I know) and immediately regretting it. 
---
Trinket the stun that comes after the sap.
---
Then don’t if you just fucking can’t. 
---
Hey guys!   
---
Got a couple of friends that are not sure if they should play classic with me this summer. Made this video like a way to persuade them. Hopefully it works. If not, it was fun making it :D
---
No one will take you to the raid. Every player has to min-max their character. Classic raiding is hardcore experience and only the most intelligent individuals can participate in this elite experience.
---
Ah ok, that makes more sense lol. 
---
bruh if you cant find 5 people on an entire faction to make wsg pop your server is fundamentally broken and needs to be fixed, slapping some bandage xrealm garbage on it barely helps anyone 
---
 Nothing. I think you saw my reply before I edited it, bad connection where I'm at at the moment. 
---
RP realms are RP-PVE realms meaning you need to flag for PVP in zones like Stranglethorn. For a lot of people, myself included, we don’t want to have to abandon the game strictly for RP, but see the gameplay as directly correlative to RP itself. 
---
You do know quest items in vanilla didn't work like they do now? If you are in a group of 5, only 1 person can pick up a quest item. So instead of collecting 8 raptor heads for the quest, you have to collect 40. Competing against tens or even hundreds of other players.
---
&gt;Meanwhile nothing kills a community like a barren empty world where you don't interact with anyone. If you want your empty sharded world, play retail.
---
Did you ever play any expansion at launch? Even with sharding the world is absolutely packed with people.
---
I do know why sharding is a problem. That's why it should only be done on release.
---
*You* clearly have no idea why not sharding is a problem. Make all the groups you want, it still doesnt change the fact that tons of quests require collecting a certain number of items (still fucked in a group) and others have a single mob that spawns once every 5 minutes with a bottle neck of literally 100+ people standing there with pets on aggressive waiting to tag it before it even appears.
---
You are being the very definition of a no changes *reee*tard. Wanting classic with "no changes" is fine, but classic wow servers in 2019 bring modern problems that require modern solutions.
---
Then again, we could just have every server down and the game completely unplayable for the first week of launch just like classic wow. #nochanges.  I'm SURE you definitely wouldn't be the first person crying on the forums about what a "slap in the face" it is.
---
No it wasn't. It was only hard because no one knew what they were doing. 
---
So you have an argument with me then create a thread about it and everyone says the exact same thing I did? Wow!
---
Lol my good buddy named his toon hobblez and always used to get whispers like ARE YOU HOBBS?? etc etc. He didn't know why for like 2 years and then figured it out lol 
---
I wonder if a system where the weight of your report is based on how often you report, how often your reports are found to be bullshit, and how often you've been reported. That would keep toxic twats from trolling people with reports and make the reports of liked community members much more impactful. 
---
How do you not realize this is satire? 
---
I never said anything about quest items. 40 heads instead, but you'll be tagging a lot more mobs than if you were solo, which is the point of grouping in the first place.
---
The only launches I skipped were WoD and BFA. And you very quickly start seeing nobody around thanks to sharding.
---
I am not an RP player. However, I can absolutely see the appeal for RP. Even if I am not an RP player, I still REFUSE to play Alliance, because...reasons.
---
So, even if I am not an RP player...I can't stop myself to at least partially act like an RP player.
---
There is a market for RP players, it is a small one, but it is big enough for Blizzard to provide RP server options for RP players.
---
I fully support RP servers for Classic.
---
And they can carry on to shit on other people... as opposed to being silenced server-wide by blizz. Toxic players should have their characters deleted as far as I am concerned. 
---
You have no idea how many people are serious when they say this. 
---
You can potentially have the option in less competitive guild. The progressive guilds will likely not take you as your dps is easily replaced by rogue/warrior/hunter and your utility is replaced by other holy pallys. 
---
It’s not impossible but it’s an uphill battle. I wish you good fortune. 
---
Just become a streamer with hundreds of subscribers. If you do that, you should be able to convince 40 morons to give you loot priority and money for weekly flasks. 
---
If the population caps will be authentic and if they will take any steps to manage faction balance.
---
If they will use sharding in the starting zones and if so, what precisely they mean by starting zones.
---
Here's the thing. I don't care if I have to wait in queues to play. I don't care if I have to wait for a quest mob (hint: go do another quest until the area clears up a bit).
---
What I DO care about, is the precedence having sharding in would bring. Not having sharding at all means Blizz has a much harder time justifying adding it after launch. Having it in the first place makes it much easier for them to go "oh this was so nice, let's keep it" then progress to "barrens is a little crowded, let's put sharding there" to then "STV doesn't match up with the leveling experience prior to this point, sharding will fix that!" to "Silithus is going to be overrun once AQ comes out and 90% of the zones are sharded anyways, let's go".
---
Got to get the news out to the world guys #changes are now on the table cause of such a wonderful user like kevinhill92
---
Considering how much of a time sink leveling one character in Vanilla is...
---
It could not be laid on thicker dude, take control of your life. 
---
It reduces que times sounds like it fixes that issue even if you don’t like it. 
---
You're having a rough day aren't you?
---
6gb Hard drive?
---
RIP porn folder.
---
llol it's amazing how far technology has improved.
---
Are you ok?
---
I've seen people seriously say this using the same words. I don't understand how to tell you that I've seen this nonsense way too much.
---
If anyone talks about a mount that isn't the Ivory Raptor, it's because they like the look.
---
The Ivory Raptor is the default one for "oh rare and special" people, because it's considered the best looking one, but it also has a very close replacement on Retail (Bone White Primal Raptor) so people who actually care about the looks over the rarity don't feel strongly about the Ivory Raptor
---
Que
---
WoWHobbs was my childhood. I would run home from school to snag the PC before my sisters to see if a new video had dropped.
---
It's okay man, it's not that big of a deal. We all get duped sometimes. 
---
I'm just glad it is satire then. 
---
you're remembering it wrong. it's random. always was in vanilla 
---
Can confirm, I remember dueling naked with my rogue, with a white dagger from a vendor and ripping up epic geared warriors because cold blood + evis was OP when evis had static damage. LOL
---
It isn’t a stun. 
---
Sadly, but i think you can't recreate your gold experience.
---
It is will be other experience with same game. 
---
There almost all theorycrafted til bones. 
---
BUT usually 2handers and pala sets isn't worth anything in pve, so even in hardcore guilds you have pretty big chance to get bouncy 2hander something because 99% dps warriors is dual wield fury. 
---
So if you are will heal and feel ok it's will be fine. 
---
Well I waited in 3500 person queues on archimonde back in the day. 
---
I understand this response is sarcastic but I think my question is valid. When I played Ret in raiding I was definitely "getting away with it." 
---
Kings isn't in Ret anymore and if I went ret they'd either be bringing a poor dps or a mediocre healer. Plus why would they let me take a 2hander away from a person who has a raid viable spec and needs that 2h?
---
It's not that I necessarily am afraid that every single person will min max but it's like, this isn't min max it's pretty much common sense. There's really just not a good reason to bring me and if they let me do it they'd have to make concessions for the whole raid and then things get messy.
---
Blizzard as a whole really doesn't have much to do with Classic though.
---
The more I think about it the more I'm down to join the mothers guild. 
---
The big question is the one that they seemingly can't answer themselves right now. How and when they will introduce the 3 BGs with their respective faction vendors and the general PvP vendors
---
I understand the struggle. The PvP gear is too strong for the entirety of T1 and T2 raiding, it renders those obsolete save for a few select specs and the weapons just barely reach the same level with AQ40 while some items of the 3 BG factions and the set still outclass a fair amount of the t2.5 sets
---
Not to mention the buffed version of the PvP gear that was introduced with Naxx to get the PvP gear up to stuff.   
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they end up  with a seasonal PvP system for classic with constantly rising power on the sets that you would have to refarm as compromise for that.  
---
Otherwise you will shove your raid into MC and BWL for trinkets tank gear and some healer sets and push almost your entire raid dps into BGs 24/7  
---
He literally doesn't understand the argument lol. He seems to be living in his own bubble where we are getting 1.12 flat out, and has missed all the blue posts talking about how that's very much not the case.
---
I feel like hes having a mental breakdown or something.
---
Nope just continuing our conversation trying to se how many people would rather have obscene wait times to enter a battleground. 
---
i used to fking DAYDREAM in school about these videos and wishing i could tank whole dungeons like this guy. great share
---
Hey I've seen that video too 
---
I don’t know can you read?
---
The moment they allowed Taurens to have other mounts then kodo's was the beginning of the end. One of the first compromises.. game design by democracy, smh.
---
Oof, I wouldn't be able to do that.
---
No one even wanted healthstones my last raids. MF’s should have potions anyways.
---
So far it looks like a majority in this thread are pro wait times. 
---
Oooooh cho-leeee nooova
---
More people than you think do unfortunately and arguing with hem is pointless. 
---
You're fine, he just doesn't understand what meta means. It's also an obnoxious word.
---
Don't listen to him, he's just mad we realized it's satire. 
---
It's a good thought mate. I'll be in your shoes soon - first born is expected in Sept! There are quite a guilds catering for parents that I've found in various forums and in Classic WoW Guilds discord, so you could look at joining up with one of those if you can't find the numbers yourself
---
What happens to players that want to okay with their already leveled friends on a faction capped side. Are they just SoL?
---
I remember waiting hours, but I have much fonder memories waiting those few hours to face people and battle with people I recognise and that I’m building a friendship with than than being able to bg instantly with completely random people I’ll never see again.
---
The arguement is wait times vs community and I choose community everytime
---
Druid alpha male in this kind of pvp yes, otherwise, shite. 
---
They are on the right path, but they have over a decade of fuckups to catch up to, so, no faith restored yet
---
I installed Retail again just for fun. 75 freaking GB. The game is MASSIVE now
---
I used immolate from beginning to end while leveling. Much more than shadowbolt actually on world mobs. If you time things right you can have most of your dots finish ticking right as the mob dies and you are wanding. Immolate and soulfire are great for pvp also.
---
Wow so now I’m mental for being in support of Battlegroups thanks bro glad I’m mental for not wanting long waits. Got anymore speculation on the state of my mental health? Jackass. 
---
Well, they agreed, I've wpvp so much on bfa. No flying mounts was a great decision in combination with warmode. 
---
Look at this dude he’s a doctor he knows the state of my mental health. 
---
I mean ret Is viable, just not for pve. Most classes have to switch between their pve and pvp specs anyway, nobody raids in the spec they pvp in.
---
In the end just build two sets of gear, your ret set and your healing set. You'll just have to switch between pvp/pve spec the same way every class does. You still get to level in the ret tree too 
---
Don't forget that Killerduki, the notorious idiot prot paladin running windows 2000, got 39 morons to give him Thunderfury as he *main tanked* MC.
---
Anything is possible.
---
You certainly nailed the first part regarding the community.
---
Getting into the science of dopamine, reward/risk field almost requires a different kind of video but your point came across regardless.
---
What strikes me most is how fresh and good the Vanilla-experience still feels today. If it's nostalgia and that I'm accustomed to retro-games I don't know. But I have played Vanilla in recent years and the feeling is still there, it's not an illusion. That in itself is something to tell your friends. :)  
---
PS,
---
Love your videos mate, have probably watched them all.
---
1.12 as major patch launched on August 22, 2006. The next patch which pretty much only affected mounts was released a month later. Another patch that affected game systems was not released until December and that was 2.0
---
That’s good for you I prefer Shorter wait times because honestly how much community is built in a 20 minute match where undoubtedly people ignore the sensible advice on how to win being yelled at them from the veteran pvp players. 
---
This is actually a valid point. Just make up some bs theory crafting about how something is better for Paladins due to proc rate. 
---
How am I supposed to flex on fools with my tabard?!
---
&gt;Brave hero! I require your aid! Lend me your magic in battle and subjugate that vile hellspawn so that it does not unleash its noxious plague upon the ground we stand!
---
*by this point, the group wiped long ago*
---
Relax lil fella. It's going to be alright.
---
&gt; Who knows but I’m sure the salt mines will be open with people on both sides visiting it frequently.
---
No need to visit the mines when you’re supplying us with more sodium than the shimmering flats.
---
&gt;I never said anything about quest items.
---
Picking up quest items is 90% of Vanilla leveling, it would be weird to ignore it.
---
&gt;40 heads instead, but you'll be tagging a lot more mobs than if you were solo, which is the point of grouping in the first place.
---
Even assuming that your group of 5 is the only group in the entire area, this would take you over an hour if you are lucky. No dynamic respawns in Vanilla. Competing with hundreds of others, as you will be when classic hits, is borderline suicidal.
---
&gt;The only launches I skipped were WoD and BFA. And you very quickly start seeing nobody around thanks to sharding.
---
Sharding as it is right now has only been in the game since Legion, and the world did absolutely not feel empty at Legion launch, but lets ignore that. Ask how much fun and community people had at BC launch, where everyone was funneled into Hellfire. 
---
This is a website built by and for Americans in a forum dedicated to a game made in America.
---
Also how is of redundant, without it the sentence would not work.
---
Hey, why can’t we stop with this “forced” bullshit.
---
Hey guys, Hobbs here. Me and the guild just defeated the Lich King 25 man
---
He didn't say anything about them being permanent. Soulshards disappear after being logged off. 
---
Haha, is that original? Audibly laughed.
---
You're still more likely to tag mobs as a group of 5 than as a solo player, full stop. If the choice is "compete with 100+ other people to hit a mob" vs "compete with 100+ other people to hit a mob with the help of 4 others" the choice is real easy
---
I doubt Blizzard will maintain 2 versions of their macro / addon API.  
---
I bet classic API is the same as BFA's.  
---
Thanks for posting this, I kept forgetting to myself.
---
He was such a huge part of my childhood, I remember watching all his  videos haha
---
Well, not 100% of the time, of course sometimes I was able to find someone on my server but the pvp was different without knowing the people that you were going to find. 
---
God you people.... they are using 1.12 as a base, “no changes” refers to implementing shit that wasn’t in vanilla. X realm BGs was and was not in vanilla. Both are legit options to consider, picking one over the other doesn’t give you the right to wave the “no changes” card, as both were vanilla features. Learn the difference
---
To be fair, we are super happy and excited and praise them simply for not fucking things up. Loot changes announcement? That was really them just walking back on a stupid change they made. When you're at the point where we dance and cheer simply because Blizzard made a reasonable choice instead of a dumb one (which is usually the case), it really says something about the competency of that company.
---
There is a video of this and its hilarious. 
---
You were in a specific situation tho, on my server we played every bg very often
---
Yeah I definitely hear that last paragraph. I'm not trying to be selfish at all, like back when I raided we had DKP and it was mine to spend plus I was Ret for Kings so I was necessary for that so it made sense why I'd be spending on it
---
But I don't want to be a burden on my team either
---
I do what I can one reply at a time. 
---
Agreed. Flying fucked up more than most people will ever realize.
---
I don't know what means SoL.
---
However, the idea is to implement a logging cap. So they will do like everyone else, they will wait in queue until a spot is available.
---
Same applies for anyone who plays or wants to play on a popular server, you have to wait to have a spot. 
---
A warrior using a two hander for dps in pve is gimping themself. Two handers are typically used for pvp and really shouldn’t be restricted to any class for rolling. Even hunters &gt;.&lt;
---
You probably won’t be raiding as ret but you should probably be clear about wanting to roll on off spec gear before getting into bed with a guild. 
---
I’m planning on going 20/0/31 you get pretty much all you need for pve healing along with good ret talents for pvping. Just make sure you get a set for both situations. 
---
Okay so I’d 1.12 is the base and 1.12 implemented Battlegroups is it unreasonable to expect Battlegroups?
---
Check wowpedia glancing blow page and psevers guides, tldr it's enough to pick human for pve. 
---
Almost all bis 1h weapons is a swords or maces. 
---
I'd rather have other people have to ignore someone than the potential for abuse or people being banned for being "Toxic" which is incredibly vague and has no actual guidelines. Who cares if they go on to be more toxic? Everyone has an ignore button, it's not really your problem.
---
I'm in NA, otherwise I would join you. I've been thinking of starting a parents guild myself for Classic.  It really will be a great community for those of us who are now parents!
---
Good job now just bring back the old good AV rather than modernist tripe
---
tone deaf? I'm pretty sure most people didn't want pre 1.12 AV. Myself and basically everyone I play pservers with and the randoms I run into on the pservers don't want it. 
---
The only people that do want it seem to be Reddit kids who haven't played Vanilla since 2005 and forgot how truly awful long AVs were. These people should not be dictating what Classic should be like.
---
Don't tell anybody but I know someone that got them in Vanilla, and vendored them because ~~my~~ I mean his logic was "it's mail, but useless for hunters, if I put it at the Ah it won't sell and I will loose my deposit".  
---
It’s not unreasonable, but it’s not a given. It should be discussed, I’m against it, because I’d argue it affects the sense of community negative, which is a key feature a lot of people want from classic.
---
Love it. xD
---
Yep. Now that it's being rebooted it will. 
---
i hope he returns he was such a good dude, and i played paladin bcs of him
---
Is your plan to spec switch or just keep that Ret spec and heal as ret? To be clear, when I raided ret I still healed and decursed 100% of the time. I NEVER did DPS as Ret, ever. I healed and at the time I don't think people thought much of it.
---
I'm perfectly okay healing 100%, in fact I love healing, I just want to be able to heal as a Ret spec and get a decent 2H for PvP. Your response actually gives me some hope if it's true that most people don't need or want the 2h for raiding so almost all the people rolling would be for pvp purposes anyway. If I could sufficiently heal as 20/0/31 (as I did in the past, honestly), then that could really help.
---
tbc tho
---
Bfa is definitely NOT the best mmo by a huge margin, rofl wtf?
---
I think this is true. They said they keep current api but they will block things that break spirit of vanilla line group finding. 
---
Damn that scared the shit out of me, the comment is 2 months old lmao
---
Yeah I'm cool with it. Epic gear is epic gear. However whatever about if I'm looking forward to some PVP?
---
There's a lot of conjecture out there, and math similar to what I posted above, but I haven't found a source that has genuinely worked it out top to bottom.
---
I agree that human is the clear choice, especially for fury. I'd just like to see a real thorough analysis on what is actually being lost by not choosing human, especially for tanking.
---
Shit out of luck is abbreviated SoL. I’m sorry maybe I misunderstood but I thought you meant limiting the amount of each faction that could be created on each server ie horde gets 2k characters and alliance gets 2k characters and after that no more of that faction can even be started. Which would mean if your friends went to a high population horde server you couldn’t create a character to play with them because the cap was reached that would feel bad. 
---
[No flying] and [city raids]
---
The “no” doesn’t apply to both.
---
I can't thank my Parents enough. This post made me reflect on rhis. My parents got me my first computer around BC launch and I just realized I never had frame lag from the computer just connection lag. Which would Mena my parents got me a pretty awesome computer for the time. Wow, never looked at it that way. Just makes me thankful.
---
Sounds truly awful
---
I think you answered your own question.
---
Your only option is to create a guild and recruit only noobs that will not question you and let you raid however you like :D
---
Hopefully a NA Central PvP server with slightly more horde than alliance.
---
They haven’t released the realm names sooooooooooo????
---
What's wrong with running Windows 2000 in 2005 ?
---
No graphical drivers maybe since it was more of a pro OS ?
---
I'm really hoping we get an opportunity to buy a CE (along with the in-game pets hopefully), not getting one in 2004 is a big regret of mine.
---
Maybe they could throw in beta access with it, I'm sure people would be lining up to throw money at Blizzard.
---
You got marks which you could turn in for XP, but it was a lot slower than leveling.
---
You can't spam Battle Shout for threat because it only generates threat when the buff is applied and not if it is already on the target. So unless people right click it off before the next time you cast it, spamming won't help.
---
I'd also say Shield Block usually won't have to be used on cooldown in 5 man's, I've realized it leads to too much rage starving unless it's a big pack with little CC. I've also had no problem healing tanks who don't use it.
---
I never really considered Shield Bash for threat on cooldown, I'd like to see how much threat it generates
---
You can still group as 5 with sharding? You just don't compete vs 100, you compete vs 20.
---
&gt; I really don’t know what other options I should look into 
---
Yeah you *would* have a hard time doing that seeing as they haven't released any information about realm names yet.
---
Eh, I’m still on team “no loot trading” and this is disappointing to me. 
---
I thought it was going to just be servers? Not a different launcher. How would you CE a server
---
I want to know for certain if all 5-man dungeon gear has their 1.12 stats or if they’re changing from one phase to the next. 
---
The best stat for a raiding ret pala is the social skill.
---
My first computer got 5 FPS on Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade
---
Eh? They wouldn’t use the old names? Wasn’t aware they weren’t released. 
---
LOL
---
A great example of reductio ad absurdum.  This isn't about the absolutely absurd scenario of reporting everyone you even remotely don't like or says a naughty word.  I cuss like a sailor.  I'm talking about fast reporting bots, gold sellers, spammers, people that gank you (or die to you) and then cross realm  to spam the shit out of you.   I'm sorry, those things aren't just being annoying, they are directly breaking the game's TOS/EULA in a way that is a detriment to other players' experiences and it should be easy to report them.
---
You just admitted to not reading my post u buffoon.
---
Yes. Berserking best TPS racial. 
---
Hobbs was [interviewed](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LoJYvAmy34o) by Crendor a few years ago about his WoW experiences.
---
So do the healers let you lose some health so you get the max berserk effect? Or you take the small amount at max health?
---
This guy was so awesome. Pretty much influenced me to be a paladin main as well as focus mainly on PVE... cause that’s what Hobbs did. 
---
Can't wait for TBC. Seeing that Draenei gave me some excitement.
---
To 90% of the people responding to this post:
---
r/woosh
---
I don't know the actual numbers but assuming +5 sword skill gives you around 7% damage increase on your white hits, it's probably not a huge advantage since white hits are a modest part of your threat output (especially without significant +hit gear, which maximizes weapon skill benefit). Obviously it's a huge bonus for dps builds though.
---
[This](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill?oldid=349241) archived wowwiki article has the best breakdown on weapon skill that I've found, though it doesn't have any math specifically for tanking.
---
Yeah, the guys leveling world first characters have a huge advantage because they never have to worry about being yanked or competing for mobs, and since they’re a hunter, they don’t need to group. 
---
I believe at the panel they said it wouldn't be. It'll be it's own hybrid between original and modern.
---
LOL some classic fan boys are even whinier than SW fans who hate on Lucas for refusing to rerelease the unedited OT, and I'm a SW fan.
---
Wow, there are no other players on the old screenshot. The game must really have been dead back then..
---
I just want my damn RP-PvP
---
Sharding kills the community and makes the world feel empty. You might not consider it empty when you play for an hour in a zone and see maybe 5 other people, but most of the Vanilla fans do.
---
Nah. you just pop it. It's powerful enough even if used at near max health. It's not at all practical to let the tank dip really low just to get more threat.
---
Honestly for me, the Fov changes that make the gameplay feel different. Such as it feeling like you're running faster.
---
I get headaches from that
---
I’ll keep that spec as long as I can. Going any higher into holy doesn’t really give much benefit. 5% more crit an inefficient weak instant heal every 30 seconds and an improved blessing of wisdom which another paladin may already bring. 
---
Divine favour might be worth taking over repentance but it’s mostly preference 
---
It sounds neat and all, but guilds *designed and advertised* around being casual, are often unable to do much of anything, and will take very long doing so. A "hardcore" guild will do MC &amp; Ony in 1-2 hrs. I could see a guild like this taking 3 nights of 3 hrs of raiding to do MC.  
---
I think a better approach might be a discord, in game friends lists, or a little clique within another guild. Easier to squeeze in a 1.5 hr raid with a regular guild, then try to squeeze in a 3 hr raid where there will be constant stops as the tank / raid leader / etc have to take a break to handle kid, you know what I'm saying?
---
I hope they make ERP servers 
---
This is awesome ! I wish more people could/would do more like this.
---
Yeah I think I waited until it was clear.
---
You couldn't see people as far away either, due to my settings maybe.  
---
That and i'm on top of the old bank, so there are probably tons just outside the view at the mailbox and under me.
---
I should have waited a bit to see if I could get an empty shot with the one I took this morning but oh well it's posted now.
---
It was in retail, it was patched out later however 
---
I think my first char in 2005 (a Prot Warrior) was 16 days /played when he dinged 60. At this point I’d already cleared trash starting at 58, and BGs weren’t out. 
---
That asshat Esfand will convince 39 others to carry him ; you can do the same ! 
---
Certainly the best for keeping aggro.
---
I can assure you I have no fear in the merits of Classic standing on it's own.. I'm just saying for someone whose never delved into WoW before, instant queuing and teleporting all over the palce, flying where you want, etc. You can get used to and expect that. To find out what you have to do in original could be a turn off for some, whereas if they had never known different, and knew that was the status quo, they would have been fine with it.  
---
Also the classes and balance etc are so different it will definitely impact what you wanna play in Classic. Better to have a pure view imo.
---
Heroic Strike has nothing to do with your weapon, except weapon speed when you want to spam (which is barely ever in 5 mans while leveling)
---
Threat from Heroic Strike is additional threat, not multiplicative (the threat bonus is a flat amount added to your weapon swing, not a threat multiplier like Defensive Stance, Mind Blast, Searing Pain, Earth Shock, etc). So if Rank 8 HS adds 138 damage and 145 threat, it'll add the same total threat (283 before Defensive Stance multiplier) from the rage investment whether your weapon swings for 1 or 500.
---
Threat per second it can better than Sunder Armor when you have enough rage, because it can be cast independent of global cooldown so you can queue it up while using Revenge, Shield Bash, Battle Shout, etc. The faster your weapon, the better it is in threat per second.
---
But threat per rage it will never be better than Sunder Armor which generates 260 bonus threat at max rank. So you have 260 threat for 12-15 rage vs 283 threat for 12-15 rage, but losing white attack rage generation. Even with Imp HS and no Imp SA, you're never going to overcome the missed rage generation. In fact, a better weapon (in terms of dps) will actually decrease the threat per rage of HS because that's more rage you missed out on from the potential weapon swing.
---
I think Joana said the half way point (time wise) in the leveling process is level 42. 
---
You bring up an important point regarding the lore developments and revelations throughout the years, and I would say that raises an important question: just how much modern lore should be recognized in Classic RP?
---
Like, people who roleplay as orcs will need to decide if they are going to go with the current lore of Draenor and take Draenei, Arakkoa, Breakers, and other Draenor inhabitants into consideration, or if they will interpret Draenor as it was in 2004.
---
Likewise, anyone who role plays as a sailor, pirate, or even a Kul Tiran native will need to just how much is known about the sea. Is there knowledge of Kul Tiran noble houses, Vulpera pirates, and Tortollan merchants? Or, once again, will Kul Tiras be as mysterious as it was in 2004?
---
There are loads of other questions like this, and I think it’s important for the roleplay community to come to a consensus one way or another.
---
Shut up and take my money  is right.
---
I feel you. Back in high school, I didn't even know about WoW. I was stuck wasting time with Final Fantasy X (Which I didn't care for I just wanted to kill and farm) Plus I had maybe $40 in high school. Once.
---
Good luck being in the community of 40 people standing on top of a quest item that respawns every 5 min. You can even start a raid group. Delusional fanboys like you are gonna kill this game.
---
WF unlocks at 30 
---
https://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/even_possible_aliens.gif
---
An RP-PVP realm, if it exists. 
---
Blizzard writing... yeah..
---
I couldn’t make it past the first 20 minutes of the first expansion. 
---
You had to have strong hatred to that animation to switch to the same exact class just opposite sex !
---
I feel like it forces any serious player to have a mage or a hunter alt. Because it will lead to high inflation, penalizing furthermore the other classes (warriors basically) that can't farm as well. Then again, I'll just charge for dungeons so I don't mind anyways. 
---
Ah. I really did read the post but missed that part. Good luck with it.
---
"then" not "than"
---
It can also work the other way as well, players could just walk into vanilla and find it tedious and be relieved when the most tedious parts are removed in retail. They were removed because players kept complaining and a lot of changes seemed good at the time. So this goes both ways.
---
I see some of your point, people often like the version of dark souls that they played first for instance. But think this just creates a slight bias instead of being totally deterministic. I think 80% of which game you prefer depends only our personality and goals with the game and so order doesn't *really* matter that much.
---
I'm definitely down for this.  I'll be rolling on NA PVP (or RP-PVP if that happens).  I know you mentioned EU, so no worries if that won't work out, I'll keep any eye out for a  group of like-minded folks on the NA side.  
---
I think he meant you wouldn't have to queue if your faction wasn't full. You could still create chars and queue if you wanted to play on the fulö side.
---
I raided ZG once with 128mb of ram, would not recommend
---
What the fuck lol. Is it's supposed to be funny because it's so stupid? 
---
As a casual player during Vanilla, I take the opposite view: I think the game has gotten worse for casuals over time (even if Blizzard has supposedly tried to make it better).
---
In Vanilla, it didn't matter whether you ran a dungeon once or twenty times: you still had the same shittily low percentage chance of getting a piece of gear that might be your only pre-raid upgrade, for example. This meant that as a casual player, you didn't really lose out by not being online. I mean, yes, your chances of getting better equipped increased the more you played, but only very slightly - and not as dramatically as in today's game.
---
Because of how easy they've made the modern game, you just keep getting rewards, so you have to play constantly to keep up to a minimum standard. The advantage goes even more heavily today to the player who plays around the clock, because he's more likely to be rewarded for his game time than he was in Vanilla, where playing another ten hours a day didn't necessarily guarantee you anything.
---
If my retail realm is available in Classic, then the same one: Suramar. It’s been my home since 2004. 
---
Why do people ask this, it's been answered at blizzcon ;p
---
Me too, my idea is to start a community for everyone that want a RP PvP, and we just all roll on the same PvP server if there are no RP PvP severs.
---
"Youtube wanted me to keep the video under ten minutes"
---
Oh how times have changed.
---
Details on sharding, server load, server infrastructure. 
---
No, it means that they removed that from happening. Unless you're in a raid (which has a timed lockout), in which case you PUG at your own risk, currently.
---
Graphic images such as this can do that.  Halp :(
---
There is video of a naked rouge that only uses a starting zone dagger. Not taking anything away from your point this.
---
The snowball and node topics were nice, I was hoping someone would mention how people would throw snowballs at allies that were midway through gathering a node so they could gather it themselves.  Ruthless 
---
"Crying" is what made this change happen. Maybe think about that before you whine about the whiners.
---
Can't prove that, you deleted the conversation out of embarrassment.
---
&gt;  Announcement that they decided to port Diablo: Immortal to PC
---
Nah fam. It is a mobile game. The design philosophy won’t work as a PC game, especially not for RPG-starved Diablo fans.
---
Also, why would Blizzard bring back the same demo from 5 months ago? If it featured the same bugs or missing textures, it would be a *really* bad marketing strategy for a game releasing in about 10 weeks.
---
This post is high hopes and no substance. The Osconty-theory is stronger than this.
---
Just make a CE to commemorate the server. People would definitely buy it. Doesn’t come with the game but comes with cool stuff.
---
He streamed the demo and likely will be seitching it up between Hearthstone and Classic when Classic is out.
---
As a healer without a wand, I'm very guilty of this if everyone has HoTs rolling.  Lol
---
I don't think serious warrior players will struggle to make gold. And you could argue gold making is the only real con of playing a warrior and that having poor warriors is also part of the balance. If you can't farm much better on a hunter then you don't have so many reasons left to roll hunter instead of warrior.
---
To prevent a hunter from soloing DMN you would need to add changes to the map or the boss. Soloing it is blizzlike so I don't see why Blizzard should nerf it. If they nerf it surely they should nerf mage lasher farming/ZG farming as well. If they nerf lashers they nerf pretty much every class. Then hunters can still solo Mara, so should they nerf that too. It's hard to draw the line. Now some would say it's a good thing to have more people in the world, I think the world is already full enough and it's good that every class has a way to reliably farm some cash solo or with a friend in a dungeon, even if you're say a healer or a main tank. 
---
Yeh I agree with you on that. 
---
Loot trading was only available as part of GM powers. It wasn't a real feature of the game any more than being able to restore an item you stupidly deleted was a feature.
---
ITS ALMOST SUMMER 2019 WHERE IS OUR DROP DATE?????
---
I almost just threw up looking at the picture on the right
---
Flawless logic
---
 While Cataclysm had some good things, to me WoW was ruined completely.   I kept playing, but it never was the same again.  
---
As I said before, go do another quest and come back for that one later. It's better than allowing sharding, and trusting Blizzard, who have been fucking up for over a decade, won't misuse it.
---
The patch right that came right after I made my twink, how could I forget?
---
Lol I know, that's not where you bleed after giving birth
---
I like how he wrote: "Here is what has been confirmed through various sources", but has "SPECULATION" in the title. I think this is just one of those people that hopes at least one speculation comes true.
---
But hey, let's all hope it's true. I want a release date announcement.
---
Prove to who? Didn't you read the damn post?
---
You are not the sharpest tool in the shed...
---
Memory is RAM and m.2 is a form factor. 
---
Ravenholdt? 
---
Honestly the dynamic respawns made a raid party of level 3 night elves raiding a furbolg cave impossible. I don't think they should do it like privates did, but I feel like they could figure it out in starting areas by making all enemies yellow for the first week.
---
I like you craghack.
---
My issue is that it takes very little to add it, Sure only 400 people are going to play but but they are going to enjoy that way more than playing on a heavy pop server where they cant do what they wanted. 
---
If the server does not last long term it does not last long term, Blizzard can pull it down and say "sorry guys we tried it but its too niche like we thought" and save a couple pence in power costs. I would be more understanding if they were still using physical serverblades becasue then its a heafty cost but now its all cloud based I dont get why they wouldn't. 
---
I can’t wait to reinstall and setup my ui. I never could enjoy elvui I Prefer putting together my own set of addons. I’m hopping they have at least bartender available at launch. I need my 4x3 boxes for my naga muscle memory. 
---
Can confirm, you both get to zero mana but dont have enough damage to finish the other one off.
---
That's pathetic if true and if not why comment something like that lol.
---
I hate retail gimme upvotes
---
M'Classic
---
The wall of specious argument. It was an effective shill piece that bothered me a good deal. But reading it today is a joy. All earnest re-posters of this should have a special icon on their toons in Classic. :) 
---
it was a joke. Calm down hall monitor
---
Yes, I’m with ya 
---
That's going to be a yikes from me
---
Without taking math into account, the difference seems to be improved threat gen vs improved dodge and NR. Human is the safe bet but NE warr have their strengths.
---
Having said that, any race prot warr is basically fine. You might want a human MT but for OT if they give a fuck and have consumes they'll do the job just fine!
---
This is a bit dependent on the guild/people you play with. If you play in a hardcore guild where every bit of tps matters just so you can stay ahead of your dps, then troll is best. Whereas on the opposite end of the spectrum, guilds that persistently struggle to just keep their tanks alive might want to take a second look at that extra tauren health. But on paper under ideal conditions, berserking is indeed the best tanking (threat) racial.
---
He ran me through deadmines once and I only had to ask once. Got on vent with him and I got to keep any item I needed. Very nice dude. 
---
Well the osconty-theory and this have basically nothing in common (yet). If what the post says is true, we might get a confirmation on the [26.th](https://26.th) that july 16th is actually the release date. But it's just speculation. It's three days away. We're definetely going to see something from Blizzard.
---
Just speculating, but this may not always be true.  Wouldn't Tauren have the option for more TPS gear while maintaining a health level, and Orcs might win with a good axe, depending in what is available at the time?
---
May not be this black and white. Idk
---
I played the Beta with 256MB RAM and oh boy that was a pain!
---
Server caps for sure
---
Seems your math is wrong. 
---
So we have gnome warrior with 300 axe skill you hit, after all mitigations for 100 non crit, with 1.0 speed 
---
40% of attacks against 63 lvl boss will be glancing blows
---
glancing blows will hit for 100*0.65=65 non crit
---
With + 5 skill will be
---
100*0.85=85
---
With 10 skill 
---
100*? and at this moment i get boring BUT wowpedia formula isn't fit for 5 skill diff
---
It's will result 1.05 not lower than 100% 
---
Hmm i will check
---
/r/comedyheaven
---
I just want you to understand that this would only lower the server populations total player base because players are going to leave if they're sitting in queues.
---
Why won't the queues clear up? Because you don't pick your faction evey time you log in, so I'm waiting for, in your example, 1,500 less people to log off increasing queue times.
---
This is a horrible idea.  Feel free to work out the kinks though.
---
Kingship? Wow small world. I was in No Mercy Mafia and joined kingship in cata.. i actually still play with some kingship people, including Hinik! 
---
I really like the new textures. The new AB and WSG maps are awesome.
---
Not sure what you are saying dude. You used a quote but I can't find who your quoting for the context. That being said. The appeal to classic starts from the second you start playing. Unlike retail the game starts at level one and demands to be taken seriously from level 1
---
I feel you on this, although I would be playing just on a PVE realm if the population is more than 5k per realm
---
you do know that "old" stuff that got removed(like old AV map, pre 1.4 epic mounts etc) are all in the game files and blizzard has access to them? 
---
When people say MoP was good I feel like they are generally speaking about the mechanics and maybe class balance. 
---
Personally I did not play MoP (outside of a brief period where a friend wanted me to play on his second account to tank for his raid)
---
 The idea of the pandas was too "immersion" breaking for me. I know there was the one character in wc3 but that was it. It was seen as a joke character (to me anyways) and not meant to be a serious character within the universe. 
---
Sure, patch has 2.0x, and is labeled BC on the wiki. Was I in the out-lands, was anything different from classic aside from expanded trees? It was classic, I don't care how you group patches on the wiki.
---
Yeah, game died. Nobody has ever played it since
---
Hey I was in No Mercy Mafia! Those were the days man. Wpvp everyday
---
Because of the debuff limit you will be using CoE/CoS/CoR and Shadowbolt.  There might be room for one or two corruptions if you have SM/Ruin warlocks.  My pserver guild did that, but then our guild leader was a warlock so he may have been unusually permissive.
---
In dungeons you are free to go crazy.  Use your best judgement as your normally would.  For example if you group is Warrior, H priest (who SW:P every mob), 2 shadow pirests and your warlock.....then Curse of Shadows is better than Curse of AGony.  Bit of an extreme example but you get the point.
---
I normally fully dot the first couple mobs and see how long they take to die.  Then I adjust my spells accordingly.  Letting your dots tick enough to make them effective is key.  For example if we are regularly tanking 2 mobs (skull and X), I might corruption the Skull, CoA/Corruption the X and then go back to Shadowbolting Skull.  In this scenario putting CoA on X is worth it since he lives longer for it to tick down.
---
Tps tank is a new(not really new lol) meta, even dual wield fury prot, on pservs they are do pretty well, and it's also more fun for healers. 
---
You can't use insignia against sap no.
---
Read what post?  It has been deleted by you.
---
I feel like battlegroups were the beginning of the end. I used to know exactly who I was up against in every BG and it created a great community feeling. As Horde I had 15 min BG queues but it’s all relative since everyone on Horde has the same thing so honor was lower.
---
The forums used to be so active and it was great having a rivalry with the other faction.
---
I really hope they don’t have battlegroups but that’s just my opinion.
---
Individual faction queues per server would really help.  The people that want to play with their friends will wait.  Those that have no preference will move to a different serve to avoid unnecessary wait times.   
---
The faction populations wouldn't even have to be totally equal like you said.  As long as there is some ratio to keep the factions relatively equal at peak times, you would have improved overall game play.
---
yea i agree i also like the new models for the most part. From what i saw the new spell effects looked like a step backwards though :(
---
Maybe I’m the only one here who thinks this way, but I actually like the idea of having the 1.12 AV. While I never played in Vanilla, it is to my understanding that AV in even the 1.12 state was harder than it is today due to blizzard nerfing the NPC’s over the years. Also, it was certainly longer because of the lack of reinforcement mechanics to end the game if the initial boss rush failed.
---
With that being said, I totally see why people want days long AV’s, but I also don’t think having AV’s that last for a few hours is such a bad thing! When you get down to it, we still will see the summoning of the frost giant and ent, questing, and other gameplay elements that we simply don’t see come into play often today. And since boss rushing won’t be nearly as common as it is today because of the NPC’s difficulty, we are still getting a vanilla experience.
---
It looks great. I don’t have any problem with better graphics, the thing I miss about vanilla is the class/talent design and community interactions.
---
what a hero!
---
Mannnnn I had a Tualaton PIII Processor, one of the fastest Pentiums at the time, 2 gigs of SDRAM, and a PCI graphics card with 128MB RAM.
---
The game had a frame rate of 2.
---
Should have got a motherboard with an AGP card slot. PCI gfx was a horrible choice but god damnit, i had fun building it.
---
There are ways it could be implemented to prevent abuse. For instance, some sort of weighted value of your report based on how often you report, how often your reports are valid or not, and how often you are reported by others. That would make the trolls reports more and more meaningless the more often they do them and make reports from decent players have more of an impact. And yes, I can just ignore assclowns... but those assclowns are free to be toxic to other players...players who may be much more emotionally affected by shitty things being said to them online...or players who are kids or whatever. Furthermore, unless the ignore is account-based, they can just log onto another toon and continue to harass those who've blocked them. 
---
Ultimately, unless you are toxic yourself, there is little to worry about. People who abuse the system will be weeded out over time. As far as those who tell people to unsub and kill themselves because they died in a dungeon, they can eat every ounce of that banhammer. 
---
Impressive, I'd like to see that video. But the rogue isn't really naked if he has a dagger. But still impressive. What level rogue against what level mobs?
---
What these other guys said, and...
---
It's a rite of passage. 
---
Find a guild that fits your particular schedule my friend. There are TONS of guilds that revolve around people having full times jobs and RL responsibilities. My suggestion would be to find a guild prior to launch as it would give you the best chance as finding a guild that matches your schedule. Although there will SURELY be a lot more guilds recruiting closer to launch.. here's a link to a "Classic guild recruitment" discord [https://discord.gg/SFTrYs](https://discord.gg/SFTrYs). There is a wide variety ranging from Casual to Hardcore guilds and everything in-between. Best of luck to you... see you in Azeroth!
---
DoTs are good for runners also.  How many groups have wiped because that one runner slipped away and aggrod that next pack?  A warlock's dots might not prevent that in each instance, but it is better than nothing.
---
I still watch his videos! He does a lot of Hearthstone stuff at the moment.
---
I wanna know which servers are hosted in Chicago.
---
I live right next to CERMAK switching  hotel.
---
**BRING THE LATENCY**
---
Wait no, dont bring latency
---
The dagger thing was only because nost had bugged rage formulas, allowing heroic strike spam. No longer relevant typically
---
Big Oof
---
Nobody without extremely established credit will be getting the Chase FreedomUnlimited card haha. This was probably positioned as a card to help “build credit.”
---
Simpler times.
---
The classic team hasn't fucked up yet, and the fact that they realize that the game needs sharding in the beginning is a good sign.
---
From what I saw the post didn't have Speculation in the title before, I think it was added by a moderator since you can't edit titles on MMO-C
---
As someone that has been working on private realms for years there are still plenty off issues on all the available cores. Consider when you do a quest do you verify the rep and exp rewards are accurate for vanilla?  The fact is loads of quests that are still running tbc reward values
---
Threads more than a hundred pages long going back and forth, with this constantly being referred to... 
---
Man, imagine being a novice and you mess up bad. People might remember your character name and some might be inclined to re-roll.
---
I still remember speccing fury for the first time and being at the bottom of the DPS chart. I got called out along with two other dudes. I'm glad it wasnt streamed.
---
Dude, you missed the point.
---
I was saying that the tank is CCing a mob.
---
In a 5man there is no reason to double up any class. So unless you have a bear tank the warrior should be tanking.
---
dont tease me with a public test realm. I need things to be finite. :O
---
You clearly didn't read my comment properly. I didn't say you can't use the launch (5.0) number. I say you can't use it if you're also going to use the latest 5.4 number. It's an apples to oranges comparison and completely ignores any sub gains due to MoP hype. You seem more than happy to attribute the last bump in the MoP shading to WoD hype, so why don't you follow that logic for the bump in the late Cata numbers. From 5.0 to 6.0 or from late 4.3 to late 5.4, the subscriber loss is far closer to 2M than 3M.
---
Additionally, the bump I referenced in the second half of my comment is not the one you refer to in the comment (occuring in late 2014). The increase in subscribers happened in the last quarter of 2013. Again, reading comprehension. Or, simply look more closely at the chart. There is a clear increase of a somewhere around 200k. You might not think that's a big number or whatever, but it doesn't change that what I originally said in my comment. This increase of 200k was the only time  between the launch of 3.3 and when Blizzard stopped giving sub numbers that subs increased because of current content alone (launch of 5.4), and not because of next expansion. As you yourself point out, the WoD bump doesn't come for nearly an entire other year.
---
Tinfoil hat time.
---
But if this is true, then the demo would be for the show floor only.  And having another build would just add work, so I can see why it would be the BlizzCon build.  OP on MMO-C did also have this to say about Immortal.
---
"AT BlizzCon, despite the Immortal devs saying there is no plan for it on PC, there were laptops running Immortal in the dev area behind the Diablo area in the back hall."
---
I was at BlizzCon and can confirm there were PCs back behind the Diablo area, but I have no idea what was on them.
---
Thanks a bunch! Just what I was looking for!
---
Brit and father here who would be up for this! 
---
Nothing is true about telling someone "go back to retail" because they don't agree with a single small element of some patches in Vanilla WoW.
---
It's one of the dumbest things that gets repeated all the time on this forum. Maybe they care about more than one small element of hte game, hmmm?
---
The picture on the right is so visually busy. The rock has more lines detailing it, the buildings are bigger and more contrasting color, someone is flying past on their mount with bright yellow hooves.
---
 It looks better, but there's something to be said for the clean simple visual style of Classic.
---
Ok, so I agree, my time line is off. It is like 3 months to 1. 
---
3ms is absurd! i am rocking 130ms from the US on a certain Europeon private server and fortunately it runs great.
---
Thank the gods for the Transatlantic cable.
---
Opening up full blast on a boss and critting early will pull aggro no matter what your class or spec.  This is more of a Classic vs. Retail difference.  In Classic you will have to let the tank build some initial aggro.  In a sense you are correct, Salvation won't help you if you are making poor decisions...but then no spell short of Pally Bubble can do that.
---
As a long time Horde warlock who NEVER got a tranquil totem, I am amazingly excited for salvation and I'll be screming in Discord if it falls off of me at any time during a boss fight.  Damn skippy.
---
Every raiding guild will eventually have an alt raid with about half as much people. Two raiding guilds will often form a joined alt raid. 
---
Classic team is still part of Blizzard. They're doing well-ish so far, but like I said, there's over a decade of fucking up behind them.
---
"LFM [insert dunegon] need [insert roles needed] **then gtg**!" For the longest time I could never understand why there were always so many people looking for more players to join their group if they have to leave as soon as they get them. (I thought "gtg" mean't "got to go" and not "good to go".) 
---
I also thought that "PST" was supposed to be someone making the "psst" sound when they are going to whisper...didn't know it mean't "please send tell", though I suppose it still had the same effect. 
---
What's the remix of shaping of the world at the start of the video?
---
So you don't want sharding why? The only reason someone would not want something added is because you don't like it or think its bad or unnecessary. But im telling you it is necessary and it is needed in order for servers to be able to handle launch day plus a few days after which is what sharding is temporarily being used for. You disagree with that and don't want it. But instead of giving any kindof constructive help by thinking of a way to solve the problem at launch you just complain and say no sharding. To directly answer your question (which if you had half a brain you'd already see that I answered) no it is not required to come up with a solution to disagree with a fix to a problem. You are free to disagree with anything and people are free to ignore what your saying and call you what you are a complainer. Its so idiotic I can't even wrap my head around it. Who posts in the comments on a forum used for discussion and can't even support their own argument or give any alternatives to the solution they are criticizing. You are the equivalent of a virtue signaler you spout a opinion without understanding the argument for or against something and on top of that you have nothing actually constructive to say. So do me a favor take 5 minutes to develop your basic opinions on things and trust me people will actually take what you say seriously. I will not be responding because you are either a troll or simple minded and I have more important things to spend my brain power on.
---
When it was found out a dude made up a whole list of them and they were all fixed. If there was "loads of quests stil running with tbc rewards", could you point out ONE for me?
---
Frost you make amazing content keep it up 
---
I don't even like Hearthstone but I watch Hobbs play it on YouTube. He posts his highlights. 
---
I like to think that ganking is like that kid from school who was a couple of years older than you.
---
Obviously in wow a level 30 can’t do shit against a 60 but as people mentioned above, developing an escaping mechanism is your best weapon.
---
Further to prepare actually, just think about where are you leveling. Always have an alternative. If you feel you are corpse farmed just go somewhere else. Azeroth is big enough and there is always an alternative for you to level.
---
Planning ahead will actually save you time.
---
“Oh, please help me, a lvl 60 rogue is ganking me!”
---
Instead of wasting mental energy and waiting for Batman to come, relocate as soon as and be done with it. Come back later, 9 out of 10 the ganker will be gone, if not, relocate again.
---
Saves you time and energy in the long run.
---
It would be nice to get something like that but i feel like its a little too late at this point if the game is coming out in the next few months or so. Blizz would have been pomoting that for a year with pre orders. Haha
---
&gt;I guess my question is if / how people intend to plan / schedule raid activities around a 40 hr work week?
---
Tuesday and Thursday raid nights from 8pm to 11 (push to midnight if we're sucking and need more time)
---
Prospective from 36 year old, married with a 14 month old kid, working M-F 8-5 professional tech job:
---
Kid's asleep at 7-8, wife's winding down and usually to bed at 8-9. That small overlap is nothing twice a week. I'll watch Grey's Anatomy 'with her' for hour 1 of the raid.
---
6 and a half hours of sleep instead of 8, two days a week, won't impact work performance. I'm only pushing for 2 hours of "me time" and that's when my wife is winding down at the end of her day. My kid's awesome and sleeps like a champ (though if my wife takes care of things those 2 days, I got dibs the rest of the week 8-11, fair enough trade)
---
Two three to four hours raids a week is plenty for raid progression, so long as the raiders are pulling their weight.
---
If no raid fits the schedule you're looking for. Make your own.
---
This is actually pretty plausible :)
---
I took hand of justice from a group of 7 melee dps (server had pre 1.4 cap on dungeon numbers, blizzlike BTW) as a hunter about 1-2 weeks before diremaul came out which introduces a new best in slot trinket.
---
Did I feel any pity or remorse? No. I ran through the dungeon for the item and I deserve it just as much as any other pug.
---
If i want fastes bg ques what faction and server type should i roll?
---
Man I sure hope my 32gb of ram is enough ^/s
---
I was lucky enough to start as Alliance first 4 months and then Horde couple years. So this time I can roll Alliance for the new quest experience and still feel the nostalgia. 
---
Lol this guy checked the entire dB of over 2500 quests? Then checked patch changes manually for all of them. I am literally playing on the same core right now and there are still issues. I was a gm on a realm for five years and verifying bugs was my job. I am still reporting these issues to this very day. I know exactly how broken the mangos dB issues are. It’s definitely better now than a few years ago but there are still hundreds of inconsistencies 
---
I too came from D2 and I think it took me until lvl 10 or so to realize I don't need to keep clicking on mobs to attack them...and that clicking faster didn't make me attack faster lol. I watched a video from one of the bigger youtubers who makes WoW-related content and not only did he also do that, he talked about trying to click on a mob's head to try to get headshots. 
---
Ah okay, still though. Let's hope he's correct!
---
Every quest had systemically increased exp rewards so it was rather easy...
---
One quest please.
---
If there's no server transfers then factions will balance naturally. If your server ends up being imbalanced then do some politicking to get people to come to your faction, or literally anything other than lobby for another fuckin forced game system that punishes wanting to play what you want.
---
Suggest you look at the bug tracker it’s pubclic
---
Unpopular opinion: I would enjoy Classic WoW with current graphics. 
---
I used to raid facing the ground.
---
Holy shit what an irrelevant thing to make a comment about. Who the hell cares about a temporary 100-200k bump for a few months. How is that something germane to this comment thread or the thread in general?
---
Yes I'm "ignoring that fact" because it changes literally nothing about my first comment.
---
If you look up vanilla wow pvp music on YouTube there's a lot of hour long Playlists with the type of music that was popular then. I still use them for shit like the gym cause I love that music but am too lazy to find the newer stuff. 
---
You know you can do that with ELVUI too right? I do the same thing
---
It really is.  
---
Five mans - problem solved.
---
Raids with a derpy master looter?  problem also solved.
---
Wow this guys voice is pure nostalgia! Forgot about him.
---
You let the boss hit you just once and then immediately pop it. You don't need the full effect of it, 50-70% health is fine.
---
i deleted my lvl 16  character and rerolled it because i chose the wrong talents (coming from diabo 2 before you could respec in d2)  i just assumed i screwed up the character
---
No matter what your tank needs to do something to improve threat. You cannot go with a 100% defensive build, it just won't work. 
---
The troll racial is better at giving threat than the tauren racial is at giving defense. So it's better to be a troll with more tank gear, than a tauren with less. Those tanks would have equal threat, but the troll would be tankier. 
---
It depends on damage on weapons compared to spells, crit chance hit chance weapon skill from other sources, duration of fight etc etc.
---
Rather impossible to say for certain. 
---
The image from the link is a huge clickbait. No one is saying that it gonna release MARCH 28
---
Why do you say you need a slow weapon for threat?
---
Well if they're commenting about this clearly they care about it. Half of the fun of PVP in vanilla was the community. Knowing the people you were playing with and against. Cross realm BGs killed that.
---
I'm indifferent. I personally wouldn't care at all. 
---
But so many others would bitch endlessly, and that would get *sooo* fucking annoying.
---
Man do i dislike new orgrimmar. Especially the music. The new music just hurts my ears... I am not someone to shit on everything they did in retail, but they ruined that city for me...
---
Not happening on first reset, but 2nd reset is much more believable and realistic. 
---
Depends. Stuff like warlock fire looks so much better now it's hard to even compare to old spell effects.
---
But of course someone is going to come in here and disagree, just for the sake of it.
---
A lot of older MMO's, at least EQ and DAoC have options to turn off or on certain graphical changes they've made. 
---
Would be a harmless addition imo, unless it means giving someone the edge on render distance/stealth detection. 
---
This is great.
---
How is Sunder bad for threat?
---
Not saying it won't happen, and being a person who's gotten within the top 300 before on PoE Races and league starts, I just have zero interest doing that in WoW.
---
Can you show us your lists ? I might roll a hunter (or at least I will have a hunter alt) but I don't know the class well enough to make my own bis list.
---
Yeah, could have been 35. Just at a leveling phase that wasn’t close to the end. 
---
No I installed evil ui and found it hard to adjust for myself. It just wasn’t my cup of tea. 
---
I wonder if the penny arcade guys will end up playing again.
---
really? i had no idea in classic you could trade mounts.
---
What this guy fails to realize, because he plays retail, is Vanilla WoW revolved around an isolated community and your reputation within it. I'm not saying everyone liked each other but people trusted enough that you weren't going to steal their gear (ninja loot). Whereas ninja-looting was a rare occurrence, loot sharing would allow it to happen wide-spread\_ And don't forget, pre-raid gear **mattered**. The majority of people never made it past or even into MC. When you put in devices that encourage the community to exploit others it affects the entire culture, not just a small percentage. When relationships become fractured before you even reach end-game there will be less of a community, less guilds, less trustful interaction, all because ActiBlizzard decided to incorporate a mechanic that literally makes ninja-looting the best route to getting gear. 
---
TLDR: stfu retail kiddy
---
Repost because my post got deleted by automod
---
Burden of proof?
---
I did look up, I searched for exp, xp experience, quest exp, quest xp, quest experience, and I found ONE bug report https://github.com/L(ight(removethis)sHope/issues/issues/374 that wasn't even about wrong exp, it was because of a bug with getting experience while dead.
---
Where are these countless bug reports about experience?
---
&gt;Read what post?
---
THE ONE YOU COMMENTED ON YOU IDIOT.
---
Tanks that produce enough threat?
---
The problem with NE tank seems to be that dodging is actually detrimental sometimes because if you dodge a blow you don't generate rage.
---
classic, not 1.12 via private servers
---
yeah your spec has some issues, need to fix those.
---
On pservers tanks are basically fury warriors in defensive stance, not even putting on a shield some times... they do A LOT of threat, so on most fights you aren't actually limited by threat as a fury warrior. I think the only one is vaelstraz and even then I've seen warriors being able to go fully ham. 
---
&gt; and some AH camper will take them all and resell for way more than they should be worth
---
You rang? that's what maintaining 2 accounts is for. Playing the game AND playing the AH... both at the same time
---
I'm somewhat in your camp.  I'm not too fussy if it all works out in the end.  For now, because of the good communication i'm content.
---
Some of the newer textures would be nice.  I could see that being done but not much more.
---
I'd be happy with only getting higher resolution and smoother gameplay because of my hardware now, so it'll be better visually than how I first experienced it no mater what.
---
I was in his raiding guild in WOTLK (Recycled Heroes). We did Ulduar and ICC together. He was an all-around awesome guy and I grew up watching him, so it was a cool experience. 
---
His videos were awesome
---
&gt;the comment is 2 months old lmao
---
Yeah necros are fun. It's just that I don't want other people who are deciding if they should play paladin to see your post and be too excited without knowing what they're getting into.
---
Some things are in the 1.12 data. All of it? No. Just the old AV map, even if it's in the 1.12 data isn't sufficient.
---
Have you watched the video? They explain how they just overwrote things initially, how they got lucky with finding a backup of 1.12 data and how they don't have older data but 1.12 and "slightly older".
---
Awesome. Seems everyone knew each other on ED somehow. When I first started on ED, I knew of Kingship and wanted to join, but they had a minimum level requirement. 
---
One day, as a level 36 paladin I was running around in STV. Who do I come across along the road? Hinik himself! I hailed him and RP pledged my allegiance, /kneeled and everything. Still one of my best WoW memories.
---
Do you remember the name of the horde wpvp guild that had the Tauren druid GM?
---
VanasKoS was an addon in vanilla where you could put people on a list with a note, and the addon would warn you if the person was nearby. But since classic has a different api from vanilla, it's not going to work.  
---
Ignore and friends list tracks the character, not the name. So if you can get an addon that adds notes to people on your friends and ignore lists, it'll accomplish what you're looking for.
---
I laughed thinking it was so true then I remembered that 2 years ago I had kidney stones. Worst pain ever. 
---
I literally told the nurse "stop the pain or just kill me I don't care but it has to stop".
---
The nurse told me that kidney stones were as painful as giving birth.
---
Now I'd be fine with classic next year :D
---
&gt; 6-8 days played for hardcore people that rush, play a lot and optimize.
---
4-5 for rush hardcore. 
---
Yeah I agree. Orgrimmar used to be really awesome. I can’t stand it now 
---
I'm definitely up for joining something like this (mother here) 
---
My husband and I are coming back for classic (going the tank/healer combo this time around) 
---
I love healing but I'm a bit wary of joining randoms in dungeons. We have a disabled daughter and a baby, and some nights that can mean I have to AFK at any minute (most nights it's fine, but you know how it is)
---
I don't do any group content in retail wow for that reason. I'd hate to mess a group around and the dungeons are that fast that I imagine it does feel like a pain to wait around 10 minutes for the afk healer)
---
It does feel like a group of parents who already know the dangers of that happening would be slightly more understanding. 
---
I mean esfand who's like one of the biggest classic "content creators" plays a ret paladin and did just fine on pservers which are notoriously tryhard so sure why not. It won't be the best of guilds you join, and you probably won't do that much damage at least not after bwl comes out, but you won't be useless either. And yes you can get hand of ragnaros, but the true difficulty of that weapon is making the gold for it. We're talking like 15k gold on current pservers and there's no reason to think the price will be any different on your server. 
---
That makes 0 sense. If I let me wife know it’s a Tuesday and raid night, she’ll watch the kids while I do my thing. It sounds like you’re generalizing dude. I’m willing to bet you’ve played with a lot people who were parents and didn’t even notice. One bad apple shouldn’t spoil the bunch! 
---
They did this on a pserver foe tbc recently. It was faction capped at 60/40 horde. The queue annoyed people so much that when they offered free faction changes, the balance went in alliances favor
---
Forget to say we are UK based and probably would be going for a PVE server. 
---
I remember saving up and building my first really good PC back in 2005. It had a ATI Radeon X850XT and I think 2gb ram.
---
Fair enough :D
---
Honestly I would wager none of current lore is recognized, it’s all pretty awful. 
---
What video ?
---
Correct!
---
&gt; Consider when you do a quest do you verify the rep and exp rewards are accurate for vanilla?
---
Yes. My last sub 120 hour run was 100% accurate for XP based on OG prima guide and archived thottbot, etc.
---
Hobbs actually inspired me to play paladin in the first place. I thought his style was really inspiring! I've mained a pally on retail ever since.
---
Every time i see a gnome i feel a very unique rage
---
Thought that the tiers for talents were cost. So I got to like level 20 without spending any points so that I could get a tier 3 talent.
---
I have chichen thighs, rice, and broccoli in the fridge. It's all I've got. Is my chicken, rice, and broccoli dinner still not a choice?
---
I shall raise you a yikers.
---
It's hard to complain when you don't know things. So here's a list of complaints/information wanted.
---
Sharding, more information about where and how long, and more confirmations that it won't ever be used outside of server launch
---
Why no progressive itemization like done on pservers? Black lotus BoP ? BoE?
---
Rebalancing of raid encounters to counteract 1.12 talents, and modern fps/ms/minmax so we experience the bosses similarly to how we did back then(trust me this is a #nochanges change)
---
Loot trading, why not just get completely rid of it. Miss loots don't happen very often I'd rather blizzard just straight ignores everything
---
Rightclick reports? Are these exploitable ?
---
HELLO PVP SYSTEM INFORMATION PLS
---
And rediculously spread out.
---
Fuck you mankirk
---
If someone is letting a meme make them divisive then they already had a chip on their shoulder.
---
Yup the guild was called The Crew and was led by Natureswill! 
---
Aside from windfury, why is a slow weapon better?
---
WUPS forgot to add it ! edited
---
Honestly, I feel like for the purposes of rivalry we already have world PvP - I’d rather have BG’s for quick queues. Think of all the epic PvP encounters  - they all happen out in the world, not in BG’s.
---
But maybe that’s just me - I joined right at the start of 1.12, so cross-realm BGs was all I ever knew, but rivalries definitely DID happen in battle groups, my friend played on a different server and kept telling me I’m in the wrong battle group because the one he’s in is where all the big rivalries are...
---
I think it means “only things that were in Vanilla at some point, and absolutely nothing outside of that, regardless of how small and innocent it may seem. (Except for this one thing I would really like)”
---
You still could have 75:25. I think that an average server, not a super popular, would have an average population of 2000 players. If you have in average 1500 allies and 500 hordes. The problem wouldn't be solved.
---
I would implement a much more drastic measure. Past a 600 players cap logged in on the server, then the faction balance is enforce through a faction based queue limiting imbalance to 40:60 max.
---
For me this is super important. Faction imbalance is a pain for the people playing in the small faction and can push a lot of people stopping, re rolling, migrating if possible. Thus leading to ever growing faction imbalance. In the end it will be even more annoying for the dominating faction as they won't be able to enter bg without waiting hours.
---
Of course this rule comes with problem but they are quite similar to max player cap.
---
For instance players starting playing on a server that used to be balance or even a player starting on a server without knowing it is imbalance would have to queue. But same applies to somebody playing on a medium pop server that become highly pop over time.
---
I think it could be mitigated if those rules are transparent and implemented at start or shortly after. And if the current average balance is shown in the server selection screen and if a specific warning is poping up the player is trying to create a char in the faction dominating.
---
Did people really abandon their main 60 that took months of work to level and gear out to go to a more balanced server? 
---
&gt; did just fine on pservers which are notoriously tryhard so sure why not.
---
"did just fine" meaning ran his own guild and had BIS gear funneled to him while still doing half reasonable damage?
---
He still makes videos, just on Hearthstone now. 
---
This is not good, you should never roll tauren tank for that hp, it most likely won't matter in saving your life. Your gear will be how you make yourself survivable.
---
Yeah, that’s called a Beta. 
---
Just play whatever class/race combo you want! If you’re a good player you’ll get into a raiding guild no problem, even more so if you’re just a good person/ guildmate in general! 
---
Not a dumb question either, if you’re not going to worry about min/maxing you should be able to find a guild that’ll take you in no problem. Most of the players aren’t super hardcore
---
Honestly I cut off my sub until classic launches because live is a dumpster fire afaik. Really hoping there is more news on a release date soon.
---
Nobody tell him. Snitches get stitches m'kay?
---
Something definitely got lost in the process of making these updated races models/faces for the Horde in my opinion. They all look so smooth and "gentle" now, like they are from some kids' show instead of the cruel, brutal races they were intended to be. Taurens specifically look like plushies, that really ruined it for me since my main is a tauren since 2005.
---
Things to add from my exprience:
---
1. Building up gold, valuable materials (you start getting endgame relevant materials in your mid 30s), value in buying all your skills, recipees, professions etc. Will save you time in the long run if done while leveling. You have to plan ahead though and favor (smart) grinding over questing to achieve that.
---
2. Upgrading gear through buying from AH or repeating Dungeons after you done the quests will slow you down *significantly*. Upgrading gear by crafting will increase your income and save you time in the long run *if* you do it opportunistically and again if you favor grinding over questing.

3. Doing dungeons with players you know are good and work well together increases your income and leveling speed significantly enough to make them worthwhile after you done the quests. Meaning you play a high tempo, "gogogo" dungeon clear playstile and you don't skip wings/dungeon parts. For example if you take the time to find a good SM group you shouldn't just do 1 wing. Make a more synergistic, class &amp; gear balanced group and do all the wings to get most out of everyones time.
---
4. Secondary professions will save you time and gold in the short *and* long term. First aid is "mandatory" for every class and generates gold if you vendor spare bandages that don't have good value on the AH. Cooking saves you money and gives steady buffs that give a stat equivalent of upgrading about two greens into blues. Vendoring spare cooked foods can tripple your vendor money. Fishing while leveling saves time and possibly generates gold because you can do it more opportunistically, it also helps leveling up cooking (which is very easy so this is a small bonus).
---
5. Gathering professions will save you time and money in the long run if done while leveling, again only if you focus on grinding smartly over following a questing guide. If you follow a questing guide and then do the gathering in hindsight because your skill isn't leveling fast enough then you will lose time.
---
Nelfs hunter don't get bow specialiation, trolls do. 
---
How strong is it?
---
+5weaponskill on ranged gives 3% hit lowering your hit cap from 9% to 6%, hunters get hitcap pretty easily without the racial but requiring less hit means you can get a small bonus on items. For an easy example you can use the +9 damage scope instead of the 3% hit one, giving you 9 damage on every attack which I think is somewhere like 4-5dps? and saves you 300 or so gold.
---
How often will you use bows? Well while leveling it's kinda hard to determine, but at 60 you will use a crossbow until you get the hunter MC bow from the quest. That is pretty easy to get as majordomo has a 50% chance of dropping the item you need and onyxia about 20%. With 4 hunters in the guild and doing split onyxia runs like pro, as last prio on average will take you roughly 2 months of clearing MC, and again that's as lowest prio.
---
This bow is pretty good and you will use it until you get ashrethul's xbow... which is a pretty fucking rare drop off chromagus so honestly you will probably use this bow for about 25-50% of the game. 
---
Is the Beta going to be open to the general public? If not, will they make it open to anyone, so long as they work on add-ons? I don't think a closed Beta will result in nearly as many good tools getting made, though maybe I'm wrong?
---
There aren't many "good axes" compared to the tanking qeapons of dif weapon types, and thunderfury is BiS for the entire game or until naxx IIRC.
---
God damn it!
---
Uhh those smooth pretty undead models. 
---
Disgusting :(
---
Pretty much yeah
---
I would like to see them try this to see if it has significant effect on the balance. You can supplement it with free transfers as well.
---
If it doesn’t have the desired effect, they can always remove it.
---
Hokay so Night Elves don't have bow specialization, trolls do!
---
NE hunter is slightly better than dwarf for PVE because of them having more base agility - however this difference is pretty inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.
---
Bow specialization (trolls) is helpful indeed! But not hugely so, cause after Rhok'Delar all the good weapons are Xbows/Guns. 
---
Hope that clears things up for ya a bit! Just relaying stuff I've read on this sub over the past who knows how long
---
So if people defend bases well they will still be able to Zerg in 1.12? I can’t remember it too well, but my vague impression is that it could still take several hours before the actual win. But you got to have those defending players.
---
I just hope returning in those items and going for the cav and the big ones is going to severely impact pushing strength.
---
New graphics, models and color contrasts are just absolutely repulsive. They don't capture Warcraft's fantasy from WC 1, 2 &amp; 3 at all.
---
I mean, when i specifically said Wrath in my post, then yes it does.
---
Also, learn to count.  Wrath was the second xpac.
---
14 year old non-memers detected.
---
Imo Orcs &amp; Trolls look way better now.
---
I think Esfand already talked about this in one of his stream before, I don’t know if I have the link for the video but what he wanted to explain in the video is that you have to prove yourself as a ret paladin in raid by making a lot of effort so they can pick you up in raids, the stereotype of ret paladins make it hard to know who is the good and the bad ret like Hunters too, so all you have to do is to prove that you are worth getting into raid
---
&gt; They should get infamous and lose their chance to join a good guild. 
---
Ninja-looting was a rare occurrence, but when it happened it was very blatant, and often the trust was broken as a guild member not as a pickup. This means that these events were almost 100% of the time reported to the forums (which was roughly the sole communication hub for the server), which means ninja-looting even once ensured you would never find a guild ever again, and therefore raid-content. Realm-transferring was harder back then and was only available for certain realms at certain times to lower population servers. This means ninja-looting would 100% make you infamous and lose your chance to a guild due to its severe consequences. 
---
Loot sharing is very different\_ it's like stealth ninja-looting. The victim of the ninja-loot will most likely not be in a guild with the group, and possibly not even aware that the gear went to someone who didn't need it. If he finds out there was a ninja-loot, he doesn't have an entire guild's voice to back him up. And since instances are not time-locked and more easily accessible, the realm community might not even take notice. It's ninja-looting without all the risk and severe consequences. 
---
Warrior: Well it's hard to convince a guild you picked NE for any good reason, but trust me it's not really that big a deal for most players playing a NE warrior, just buy edgemasters looool.
---
Rogue: None will bat an eye. There's dagger spec to save you ;)
---
Priest: You are still a priest in dungeons and in raids well honestly it's not that bad as people make it out to be. It's overall hard to enforce players to play a specific race, especially when it's not a private server where people reroll and start over every 6-18months. 
---
Druid: Druids are usually disliked to do dungeons with as a healer, they are bloody amazing as tanks though so a lot of healer druids gear up in dungeons as tank, they just find a guild healer friend and spam dungeons, often it's easier that way than trying to find a tank anyway. But it's not like people will straight up refuse to have a druid healer either, people will shrug and say goddamnit, and then move to the dungeon. 
---
That is like &lt; 0.5% of the playerbase. Most who follow speedrun guides won't get much lower than 6d played. People who regularly practice speed leveling will though.
---
Yeah, high quality textures, models, animations and movies will do that. You have to put it into perspective. When vanilla came, it had around 8 gb on my 30 gb hard drive. Now it has 66 gb on my 500 gb ssd.
---
How good is it for tanking? 
---
I personally am planning on leveling at a good pace to get a head start on gold farming. I actually dislike leveling in general but the ‘race’ aspect on fresh servers makes it more exciting for me. 
---
A LOT easier to hybrid. 
---
No, addons should come over time. Why do you want people being able to cheat from the get go? (Because let's face it, most addons are cheating with making your life way more easier than it should be.)
---
Check Geek &amp; Sundry on youtube.
---
I personally am going to main an shaman -- which I plan on playing whenever anyone else in my group is on or for raids as a healer.
---
Naturally, shamans aren't the greatest at grinding and I'll be damned if I'm going to be paying gold to respec.
---
So I'll be also leveling my rogue to 60 for ganking in Lakeshire / stormwind and for pickpocketing and mining.  
---
This way I can do whatever the Hell I want and easily grind cash without needing to gimp my main to fit into one role or the other.
---
They are going to crumble. You can quote me on that. 
---
There's no accounting for taste, and everyone will have a different opinion on current lore developments. I personally really love what was revealed about Draenor in WoD, but despise what was revealed about the nature of demons in the same expansion. I don't believe in cherry picking lore and treat everything as canon regardless of my own opinion of it, which made Legion less enjoyable from a narrative standpoint. Similarly, I love the lore that is being introduced by BFA, but despise how it's being conveyed in the narrative.
---
However, that's only one voice out of tens of thousands. Everyone will have a different opinion on the matter. You have made it clear that you would rather ignore lore developments post-Vanilla, and that's okay too. But, a consensus still needs to be reached on the matter.
---
Of course a lot of lore developments will also be irrelevant. The nature of the Old Gods, for example, is only known out-of-universe through the Chronicles books, and is still not entirely clear in-universe. In Classic, the Old Gods were even more mysterious, and did not become relevant until Ahn'Qiraj. Similarly, races such as Gorlocs, San'layn, Sethrak, and Naaru would not be known at all, as they had no presence on the Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor and lacked either the means or interest to communicate with the Horde or Alliance.
---
It would be nice if the Classic RP community could get together to discuss this issue, as it will have drastic effects on how we choose to roleplay when Classic launches.
---
Thunderfury was BIS well into TBC. 
---
And Why was it ? Because of Casual Gameplay
---
Thats the first day of PAX....
---
The weird thing is that although theoretically they could include anything from 1.1 to 1.12, practically they really can't. They themselves said that they only have 1.12 data. Although they have source code for any patch, without the data their hand is pretty bound.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4hpic/blizzard_only_has_112_data_why_do_they_pretend/
---
(I might come off a bit abrasive there, that wasn't my intention.)
---
I just find it interesting that on one hand they detailed very publicly that they only have 1.12 data and on the other hand they repeatedly say that they "decided" that we'll get 1.12 this and 1.12 that. Maybe some things could be brought back with only 1.12 data and with older source code but overall what is happening is that they luckily found a backup of 1.12 and Classic will be 99.99% 1.12.
---
I think it would be much better if they just said clearly that "we have 1.12, Classic will be 1.12", instead of riling (some) people up with "we decided Classic will be 1.12"...
---
Everything you said here is pretty much objectively wrong
---
&gt; For rogues it's honestly not a big deal since they have +5 skill from talents. Non-human rogues can get maladath as an off-hand and reach 309 skill, or just go daggers.
---
btw at what point is dagger spec good? can u take it from the start in preraid blues?
---
Where do you think they make mobile games? On mobile phones?? Of course they can run the game on computers.
---
I have a feeling the original meme is prettt spicy because it isn't #patriarchyisevil
---
what are you even talking about
---
1. 1 boss is ?? and its the last boss of ubrs not a 5 man
---
2. Show your work
---
3. If you can't get a hit on a mob you don't have threat on that mob (other than maybe 200 from shouts and blood rage and thorns). 9 times out of 10 I'm with you though, your main weapon should be slow
---
No Shit sherlock... have a code which used the old archtype of server infrastruktur cant be implemended 1:1 at the current infrastructure. And Still you have the Code all you need is to rerwite the code at the latest archtype of infrastructure which means that the old code from 2006 from script and mechanic wise is close to untouched. This makes the game 100% Blizzlike because BLIZZARD knows how the code back than actually looked like
---
I completely agree with you but when people like to do that this is also completely fine.
---
Horde quests were rushed before release. Alliance is a much more complete experience 
---
No changes is just a fucking phrase it does have to be the same meaning for every person.
---
Anyway IMO:
---
Keep the game feeling like vanilla did as much as possible, but in terms of gameplay but also nostalgia. This means I'm completely okay with re tuning raids numbers to have some of the difficulty they had back then, but I don't want mechanics changes. 
---
As for 1.1-1.12 stuff, I pref a well-made progressiveness. So stuff like dungeon caps, progressive itemization (even stats) and such.
---
I'd want the 1.5 or 1.8 version of AV but with some reward adjustments that basically incentives players to attack slowly base by base, do some defense(limit rewards from losing), and ultimately AV should not be a good source of honor, do AV for honor in av weekend fine, but not off weekend and especially not on ab/wsg weekend
---
You linked a mob from ubrs and convinetly didn't link any ?? bosses
---
you bourgeois filth /s
---
depending on if they do beta like they did bfa beta. streamers and add on devs if the big ones will get in pretty early. along with other random people. 
---
but I think we'll get plenty at the start.. worst case an addoj dev can find someone with beta access and have them test the add-ons for them. 
---
There are certainly add-ons I'll abstain from using due to personal preference, like quest helpers, but others are important to be competitive in PVP, and some minimize tediousness without causing any bad side effects (Mailbox, Auctioneer). Those I'd like to be able to install right away.
---
Probably a majority of the playerbase uses *some* addons, even if there are others they personally dislike. If addons are going to be made available eventually, they might as well be made available quickly. I want to have a long time to deliberate over which ones I will use, and for the community to be able to begin discussing which ones are good or bad in advance of release, so I know what I want to look for.
---
I didn’t like old Orgrimmar, but I totally agree with the current music.  I usually don’t play with music on anyways, but if it’s on, I just have to turn it off in that city.
---
Alliance had an advantage in PVE due to paladin blessings.
---
For city location, horde generally set their hearth to Kargath to make up for their cities lack of proximity to Blackrock Mountain.
---
In PVP it's debatable. Horde maybe had better facials, but Paladins made better BG healers.
---
In favor? Not really.
---
Blizzard started with developing alliance early which is why some of the zones are fucking garbage as they weren't made that much for good questing (westfall..), hordes were made later while they were rushed a bit it also meant that the devs had gotten better a good gamedesign by then.
---
With enough crowdpummelers you can tank it all. I probably wouldn't advice it to a guild, warrior might be better at some points, but you can tank it. 
---

---
Basically they make solid offtanks all the way through.
---
You got exp only once for those quests, like other repeatables
---
Stonard is further from Kara and ZG than Uldum is from Caverns. But I honestly forgot it existed as an alliance main.
---
The issue wasn't that Uldum is far from Caverns, it's adding unneeded travel to a routine many have had for 4+ years. Since Legion came out, I've been running 8-10 characters through Dragon Soul each week. Adding 3-5 minutes of flight each run really adds up. That's nearly 30 minutes of my week spent just flying to the instance, ignoring the fact that it's then a 15-20 minute clear.
---
I actually really like the newer tauren females
---
Plus my main is a paladin so I get a free car at 40, so I got cash to spare week 1 when AH has dirt cheap mats to flip :O
---
Quests, mob kills and exploration
---
Sounds like good memories :)
---
Will he be playing Classic with you?
---
The human racial isn’t that great when actively tanking a boss. Your rage income is higher than a DPS warrior which means you will be using heroic strike a lot more. Since heroic strike converts your melee hit to a yellow hit, it’s not subject to glancing blows. 
---
Honestly so long as I pick a PvP server with good population and relatively balanced A/H I don’t give a shit who’s on the server. 
---
I still don't like how they did the animations of the newer models. It's cartoonish because it's overdone.
---
Yeah, those are the speed run times.
---
does ElvUI have an option for hovercasting? 
---
I always used pfUI and it had /pfcast SpellName(Spell Rank) for hover casting and healing + BOPs became so much easier
---
Actually there are several benefits if you are on a the "weaker" side in terms of pop in terms of PvP servers, which is usually horde as long as its not a ridiculous ratio.
---
First of all you have more opportunities to solo open PvP. The vast majority of open PvP encounters are people of similar level ganking eachother to mark their territory and contest farming spots. This means you will simply get to have more of these fun encounters.
---
Secondly grouped world PvP theoretically favors the more populated side, but in my exprience grouped open PvP is much more about the sheer willingness to do it rather than population. If you value PvP and play with people who also do, then you will not get stomped by sheer numbers the majority of times.
---
Third, you will grind honor in BGs faster, because you will have less waiting time on average.
---
It's also about how the YouTube algorithm pushes out your videos to people, which is really more important than the ads because you want people to see the content that you make etc. the ads don't do much on their own.   
---
My personal rule of thumb is that I only make the video as long as I need to in order to feel like I'm getting the point across, however long that is.
---
For some people ranking and/or raiding is 90% of the game. Rushing to 60 makes sense in those cases.
---
US? Ally or Horde? Server?
---
Have you considered abandoning them?
---
My primary alt in wrath was named Tarrou and I would get messages pretty regularly asking me about gold farming.  Was super confused until I saw some of Tarou's guides online, hah.
---
I play female orc for the animation that’s it 
---
By joining an overpopulated side you basically punish all the people already on that server. I don't like your egocentric approach to this issue.
---
MC is easy though. A crew of people experienced in doing it with an undergeared raid can easily clear it. The biggest hurdle is reputation to actually summon Majordomo and Rag. Doing those 2 first reset would be impressive.
---
This is something that if Blizzard weren’t to do it, that would be because they’re not only recreating a game from 2004, but they’re role playing as if it’s still 2004. 
---
J Allen Brack walks into the office every morning and says “How the fuck did we re-elect this bush guy??”
---
No one in Blizzard headquarters are allowed to use iPhones and instead has a Motorola Razr. No one knows what Instagram or any social media is. One employee bought a 2018 Toyota Prius a few months ago and upper management forced them into exchanging for a 2002 Dodge Neon. 
---
Yes. Speedrunning = hardcore rushing. 
---
are u ok m8?
---
Only hardcore guilds will care about your race. Your own enjoyment should be your top prio. Ijust remember that shadowmeld isnt useable in combat like in retail
---
I remember watching the Cata trailer and my first thought was "Wow, they just broke their hold over me". Before Cata I would ALWAYS go back to playing... I quit several times during WOTLK, maybe once in TBC... Cata changed the world I loved and my addiction to the game was severed.
---
The problem is amassing a guild of 30+ who all do 18 hours optimised lvling, to do MC
---
That is fantastic to hear, because it shows that the incentive works well. Just a bummer that they didn't implement a proper cap for the faction change. A simple rule that would have solved this problem is to only allow the change when the other side is below 49% or so.
---
There was a guy on a private server who had like 30 days played before hitting 60. There's lots of ways to enjoy this game.
---
Just cross your fingers and hope that a couple months in when BGs release and you're already gearing up and invested in the community, you don't fall into that situation. 
---
Not so much because of streaming as it's just because of top guilds, but Tarren Mill is an awful server on live because of Method, and before them Ensidia and the Kungen fanboys. Always regretted that I moved my main there, and never got off it again because I ended up having too many characters there for it to be worth moving away.
---
Well its only like 53/47 ally now, so its not bad. Much better than before.
---
It worked even in Legion, if I remember correctly.
---
I had something similar planned, Im not a parent just a guy with a weird work schedule in the UK. I most likely be active very late from 11pm to 5am and will look for people in my server with similar schedules or families who can only take a couple hours late night before bed. Very good idea all the best wishes we find and help similar people not play alone :)
---
You probably wont be main tank in raids but if youre good enough noone will have a problem with you tanking dungeons as hybrid.
---
Yeah don't worry.
---
I won't bother with Ret, maybe in TBC (I'm hoping for TBC fwohhhhh :3)
---
But nah its cool I understand it's better for me to wear Cloth. 
---
Gah can't wait for Classic. 
---
Shadowbolt and lightning bolt hurt my heart nowadays.
---
I know Forsen will play and their are a few others, but a lot of them are not english streamers. It's still possible to hit a 15k polish streamer where your entire server will be polish then.
---
Because this is/was a huge issue in vanilla that didn't get properly solved. Both sides the over- and the under-populated one loses out on a server where the balance is too skewed.
---
I have soo many questions about battlegrounds.. How will the gear be implemented? Will the rep gear be in from the start? Will BGs be in at the start? If not, how will honour work? Will AB be released before AV like on private servers? What about the extra spell pen trinkets? 
---
But in the end I don't really care because I'm not a fan of PvP. 
---
Just spec holy for raids and then respec for PVP
---
If you're good and a good guild mate you'll get rewarded all sorts of stuff.
---
Jokes on you, just because you told me NOT to upvote, I will do it anyway.
---
He inspired me to make a paladin and get Skull flame shield. I remember when I bought it from AH for 400 gold. Me and my friends called aoe grinding "hobbsing". I ran random people on Sylvanas EU through Deadmines and SM quite a lot.
---
Flag runners in WSG, base defenders in AB, boss tanks in AV - sounds like Druids play the most essential role in every battleground and they're good 1v1.
---
Absolutely. You can turtle the shit out of "new" AV for hours. Most people who want the old probably didn't play enough AV to know what it actually means.
---
On PvP servers you can only have characters on one faction, so you do in fact pick a faction every time you log in. 
---
That's actually fantastic for horde side. If you value PvP you want to be on the *slightly* less populated/active side.
---
Horde has Zeppelins connecting their Capital cities directly. 
---
Alliance has shitty boats which connect Menethil and Auberdine. 
---
Also horde has a Zeppelin directly to the middle of STV. Alliance does not even have a flightpath in there besides Booty Bay.  You may say that Alliance gets boat to Theramore which is nice for Ony, but it's not faster than teleporting to Thunder Bluff and flying to Brackenwall Village.
---
Horde gets a teleport inside Gnomeregan for their ~lvl30 characters. Alliance does not, and also has to run on foot towards Scarlet Monastery - a dungeon of comparable level. 
---
You may say that Horde is gimped because they have to set Hearthstone in Kargath. But it's not entirely true, since Kargath is where the mages hang out and you can get a teleport for 1 gold or even less, a good example how community turns a disadvantage into an advantage of having a cheap and quick to use travel hub. 
---
There are a lot of less obvious advantages like Thunder Bluff being close to popular farming spots as Mara/Dire Maul and AQ proximity, Azuregos spawn 2 minutes away from Orgrimmar etc. 
---
Sadly improved drain soul sucks.  You have to kill the mob (not your pet) and you might have to even kill it with the drain soul tick as the final damage (maybe not this one, can't remember).  In either case is it is way too much work to be worth it.  If any mob death from any source triggered it, then maybe.  
---
CoEx gives us a snare, which is the best option with those extra points. 
---
There’s a switch in the classic client to upgrade the graphics
---
Check out his channels boys. He has an amazing attitude and deserves all the support in the world.
---
Muffin me up boys.
---
holy shit, didnt thought i would say that ever again. real blizzard devs are back! that wants to make GAMES great again and care for their players
---
Already decided against this spec lol. I guess I hadn't made up my mind 100%
---
I really don’t wanna see these horde facials
---
You have no idea what you are talking about, I feel it is pointless to discuss this.
---
Those better horde facials always bothered me xD
---
This. Love it lol
---
I remember a hunter on pserver who was farming dm for this staff to get infinite free food for his pig pet. I wonder how much many can this save for them.
---
Remember leveling and running instaces without wowhead or questhelper? That was the pure "vanilla" huh :-D kids from BfA don't even read the quests, poor them.
---
New? It’s been out for 9 years my guy. 
---
Yeah a rougue needs a dagger to use their skills it's not possible without it. But since it's a level 1 starting zone dagger and he is completely naked besides of that that's only semantics.
---
Level 60 and he actually did PvP so no mobs. I can look it up later from my computer.
---
You know what those bastards are doing? Making it harder and harder for me to resist trying this shit out.
---
I hope they're proud of themselves. Jerks.
---
r/whoosh
---
I have spent more time in there before the rework than after. But you are right, time flies lol.
---
Correct, the more casual friendly game was more popular than the game that was not "casual" friendly.
---
Didn't read the post, eh?
---
Ah gotcha, but yea it's crazy to think cata came out 9 years ago D:
---
Thank you for the podcasts it makes waiting for classic better. Keep them coming :)

Larger servers would fix that.
---
If there’s something like this for Horde players in the US, Id be in for sure! (Father of a 2 year old)
---
They never said they had to use this. They said they chose this. They never said they only have 1.12.1 either. It's the only one they have with ALL raid values. The entire point is that they can now accurately provide raids all the way to finish. Of course they will have gone through nerfs and will be easier, but at least the abilities, armor, resists should be close. If they had 1.5 as an example it still would have done them no good as far as having  AQ. If they had 1.8? No Naxx. If they have any old AV, which is highly likely they can then tune that. They have CHOSE to use new AV and they chose it because they care about streamers and their stupid content more than us. You will see them CHOOSE cross realm BG's for the same reason and the same streamers/influencers who defended this AV will defend that.
---
Two months here buddy, i know the struggle
---
Average at 3 things or good at one. 
---
He’s the reason I switched to pally in tbc
---
I had 512 ram
---
if I DC'd from a 40man raid or I a major city I couldn't log back in unless I disabled all my addons.
---
I remember using the canonball runner trinket, I loved it for pvp! 
---
They won’t reveal it early.
---
My plan is to spend 1st hour on launch reserving cool names and then after an hour pick the lowest pop realm since within an hour the streamers and the hordes of twitch idiots will have picked a server.
---
Both. I'm running Paladin and Shaman.
---
We know that will mostly be the case as asmon, nixxiom and classicast crew will role on same server.
---
US Alliance
---
&gt;Due to the time constraints imposed on us parents we’ll likely not be raid focused  
---
&gt;&gt;however don’t think I wouldn’t love to as I never had a chance during Vanilla. If we can make it work, so be it.  
---
Maybe you didnt?

It would be chaotic to cherry pick the lore. If we're going back to Classic, that means we're going back to Classic lore, I don't want to hear about Pandaria, I don't want to hear about Drustvar, there are some parts to new lore I like, but I think we all need to make the sacrifice to ignore the current lore. 
---
When I ran my RP guild on three private servers, it was way more fun for everyone to ignore the current settings, places, lore that Blizzard had developed in future expansions, because we played within the framework of Vanilla itself, and that meant we didn't know what Kul Tiras really had besides Boralus, and what we knew from Warcraft 3. 
---
You can say it's all down to tastes, but at the end of the day, there has to be a solid line we all agree with, otherwise I could RP my character as an autobot from the Transformers Universe. 
---
Still thinking June 25th sounds more likely barring unforeseen delays. They will probably try to get this out in time to compete with FF14's new expansion on July 2nd.
---
As long as reinforcements are not a thing I’ll be happy :)
---
I see what you mean from a modern development standpoint  but I'd be surprised if they thought that through back in 2004. I'm guessing they tried to make a 5 man but either the boss design didnt work for such a small number of players, or they wanted to make something a bit more epic/experiment a bit.
---
Well, that would be awesome. Maybe we know in three days.

He took the meme seriously

Orcs (as in Thrall's shamanistic orcs) and Tauren were never intended to be cruel, brutal races. 
---
Alliance was heavily favored in vanilla WoW and mainstream journalism actually covered it along with game journalism. They had much more complete lore/quests. They had much easier raiding due to blessing of salvation and Holy Paladins were very, very strong in pvp and the decursive mod pretty much made them broken. They had a easier time into the Horde's base in AV that most players could do, but old AV prevented it from being a big deal. The new, broken modern AV will heavily favor alliance again. It's their favorite bg though so I doubt they are happy it's now ruined. Alliance also had a stupidly easier time questing before 30. They had multiple choices and routes while all Horde were in the Barrens.

"**World of Warcraft is staged as a game of epic conflict between the two factions of Horde and Alliance, and we chose to play Horde. Though obviously biased, the most annoying part of the game for most of us is the level of development of the "other side."** 
---
"**In the end, I am just a jealous Horde player... It is up to Blizzard to fix this game; I have done all that I can. Either World of Warcraft can be remembered as a great MMORPG, or it can go down as a horribly imbalanced one, like many before it. That's for Blizzard to decide.**"
---
As to why Alliance lost BG's? You had really bad players playing paladins. It's probably the worst played class in MMO history while people cried about hunters (who had the hardest pve rotation in the game for ranged). There was never a real excuse for losing BG's on Alliance. There were excuses for losing 1 v 1's, but the people who point that out ignore the dwarf and gnome racials. The horde didn't force you all to roll humans. Horde cared about pvp racials more than pve racials. It's why there were so few trolls, who probably have the worst pvp racial in the game.
---
Overall world design was to favor the Horde while leveling (they have better FP and base locations overall) because during this age the Horde and enemies of the Alliance are pushing hard, forcing them to lose lands.
---
This appears static in the game (minus patch differences) but it was the initial setup. Due to development though, Alliance ends up with better quest chains and scripted events overall.
---
Both result in a feeling of the Horde being more backwater, which just enforces the RP experience more. Other mechanics shape the end game feel of both factions as others have mentioned too.
---
&gt;release date
---
This!
---
That's the point, they said they "chose" 1.12, while they only have 1.12 data. (Yes, they did say it, I've linked it. Where did they say that they have other data just without "all the raid values"?)
---
I have no opinion about which AV is better. I just find it weird/funny that they say they "chose" or "decided" something when they have no other option, really.
---
Villa warrior here. I could easily tank in fury due to prot being garbage. If you wanna pvp though you'll need to respec. I was a heavy pvper and I respeced a lot. All downtime was trying to make money.for respec. 
---
Imagine being in a battleground with useless shamans. Yikes.
---
Check out [Defcamp and Melderon's video] (https://youtu.be/xACddNKUNtc) about the subject. I personally have always preferred the Horde because I like underdogs and redemption stories.

Shaman can grind DME lashers fairly competently
---
&gt; which if you had half a brain you'd already see that I answered 
---
No you didn't. Every time i ask you one simple, direct question you try to avoid direct answer with "it is expected", " you're bringing nothing to the table", "complainer", "we need alternatives", "imaginary people ignore you" and bla-bla. When there are only two answers - Yes, you the one who should look for solution for the game or No, it's actually developers job. You cannot choose second, because then your original claim will lose its meaning in this case but in this claim the whole point for you, this is your food and self-affirmation tool
---
And you just proofed it:
---
&gt; no it is not required to come up with a solution to disagree with a fix to a problem   
---
&gt; I will not be responding 
---
 if you agree that I am not obliged to have any solutions, then why you initially asked first about it, it does not make sense. Unpleasant contradiction :(
---
&gt; I just like asking people who are against sharding what their proposed solution would be. 
---
Looks like you care more about asking random people whose job is not solving game design challenges  so that they enter into an argument with you about things that they don’t understand and, most importantly, don’t have to understand. I'm sorry that in my case you couldn't eat anything, I didn't bring anything to your table and of course you cannot choose the first option because of its obvious even for you stupidity. Therefore we are still sitting here and I continue to read every time about what you think others should do, think, otherwise people will ignore them and not take them seriously and other elements of the imaginary world. What can i say, good luck next time but don't overclock you brain power too much, we don't want another cataclysm.

He's a regular hearthstone streamer on twitch.
---
Less that I hated the Female UD animations, more that I loved the Male UD animations - but after looking at your guy for hundreds or thousands of hours it's the little things that get to you.
---
Since then I've actually become a bit of an animation snob, and rules out race / sex combos for certain classes depending on how frequently you use the animation in your rotation.
---
Example: Male NE caster have an animation that looks like they have a headache, and it looks totally garbage. Alternatively Male Trolls have a 2h melee animation where they spin in a circle with a whirlwind attack - which looks totally awesome, until you get to something like an execution phase where you are just spinning in circles over and over for 90 seconds in which case it looks retarded.

Can't remember what the post said.  The post was deleted out of embarrassment because ya got caught in a lie.
---
What's stupid is thinking that the only way an undergeared rogue can deal damage and be effective in pvp is by using the tactics of meme pvp videos in early patch.
---
A leveling or raiding spec combat rogue, one without any epics can still demolish in 90% of 1v1s against people who aren't in raid gear as well as some who are, and have a chance in some 2v1s.
---
Give a rogue who isn't even in full pre-raid BiS one epic 1h weapon from MC or ony and a spec to match it, then watch him top the meters and wreck in the average bg or wpvp scenario.
---
I'm not sure what you mean. Is that like your recommendation in the other comment about different rates? If so that may be more likely than osrs. It'd be kinda like seasonal affixes in m+, which I think is kinda cool. I think it still depends on what happens though. 
---
Yeah Blizz absolutely love fucking with other games with the release dates, I honestly can't remember a time when they haven't done it.
---
The FFXIV expansion was revealed after Blizzcon, so they could easily have pencilled in July 16th as their target date and then moved it forward to come out the same time (or just before) Shadowbringers.

If I were a betting man I'd put money on it launching within a week of it.

That’s why Charisma is one of their main stats in D&amp;D :\^)

Warriors in "bad gear" is a myth, it's not that they are garbage in bad gear, it's that they scale way harder to god mode with good gear. There are several dps test videos that show that even in pre-raid bis blues they are as good or better than rogues, and anecdotally I play both rogue and war on one of *those* servers, and have confirmed that finding at the prebis, T1, and T2 gear levels in both PvE and PvP.
---
Also I think that people are seriously sleeping on hunter for PvP, writing them off as poor PvE dps. I remember watching my friend play his very poorly geared hunter (mostly blues with Rokh) and straight up dominating people all day in both BGs and WPvP with proper kiting, I think Hunter has by far the highest out play potential and skillcap in PvP and so long as its not a knife fight in a phone booth I don't think there is a fight you can't win.
---
Full disclosure - I am planning to main Rogue myself, but only because I am going to be a WPvP main, if my focus was on anything else (Instanced PvP, or PvE) I would roll Warrior in a heart beat - it's sad to say, but it is just an outright stronger class.
---
Also tank has barrage generation at early levels so you need to let him get his sunders in before you go ballistic on those mobs

Rogue or priest.
---
Warrior needs to respec for pve and pvp and people prefer rogue sap in dungeons to dps warrior.
---
Druid is the worst healer hands down.
---
Fear ward is a nice to have but honestly you can raid as priest without fear ward. 
---
Yeah. It’s a touchy subject and I totally empathize with those who want the game back in its precise original state. But toggleable graphics updates as long as they had absolutely no effect on gameplay mechanics (not sure if that’s even possible to accomplish) would be alright with me. 
---
Hail! Berry Talfoot from The Shining Strand salutes you! 😉

You people and your denial fo sharing. They've already said sharing will only take place the first couple weeks in the starting areas... you people that dont wa t it are delusional what classic launch actually looked like. It won't ruin the launch at all.

Very much interested!

Father of child here and limited time to game so a social group that understands this would be great!

yea i think thats an important perspective. I never got to level cap, but i also didnt feel the \*need\* to like i do in current wow. Game play was rewarding at any level of play and that was why it was fun
---
But wouldn’t more crits from better gear = more flurry procs and in turn more white hits that benefit from human weapon skill?
---
I hope so.  Unlike most on this sub I am not 100% against any changes whatsoever, I will accept and even welcome minor convenience changes like this as long as they don't go overboard with it.

---
99% of your threat output is gonna be skill/gear/consumables/buffs. When you got all that down, you can worry about racials. The best tanks playing in the best guilds with the best dps should absolutely worry about going troll for that extra boost of tps. The average player, however,  will pretty much never be in situations where a racial will make the difference between holding threat or not.
---
So to hammer down on this, I'm not saying trolls don't make the best tanks, they do and I would recommend troll to anyone who is planning to be a hardcore raider and minmax their character to the fullest. What I'm saying is for everyone who won't find themselves going in that direction, their choice of race is less important than many other factors when it comes to being a good tanks.
---
I was night elf always and just started an undead on a pserver. I am currently questing in ashenvale and killing the nightelfs feels just so wrong.
---
I'd say 4 months
---
Seeing how they usually release content from Aug - Dec. I would be surpriced if this happens before then
---
Reinforcements was 2.3.0 so we're safe! I'm so happy we are not getting that version.
---
&gt;Because of how easy they've made the modern game, you just keep getting rewards, so you have to play constantly to keep up to a minimum standard.
---
I can attest to this, I cant play current wow every day this expansion, asnd when i do its really only to raid, I see my self getting VASTLY under geared compared to my guildies and freinds that play every day. And thats just expected. unfortunately now, it gets to the point that i start to become a detriment to the group because i cant keep up with the gear because i cant play, which destroys the fun of it from a casual veiw. 
---
Right? We have Blessings on this side OP. You know what to do.
---
Don't worry, she'll get engaged again
---
A DPS warrior can tank anything but main bosses in raids. For farming gold you simply do 5 mans and get gold while getting people BIS raid gear. When you get some gear you lower the amount of people in certain content. Eventually you and a healer when DM comes out. 
---
Rogues HAVE to respec to pvp. Mages HAVE to respec to PvP. Warriors fury spec is pretty decent in PvP. It's just not as good as Arms which is the best melee dps in PvP. Once geared fury is probably better than enhance and ret and rogues in a group to be honest. It's just far worse 1 v 1. Arms can do decent in 1 v 1 with good gear and consumables. 
---
Warriors, Hunters, Locks probably have it the best as dps because they have a capable PvP spec as a raid spec. Some heal/casters can also get away with it. Priest is the one that really can't in raiding. They can in 5 mans though. They can make some more heal focused pvp/raid specs work though.
---
Sure some warrior will say I am wrong who doesn't realize Classic ain't vanilla and Fury won't suck until AQ in Classic because 1.8, 1.9 are included in the patches. I will still go arms after Ashkandi but the idea that fury is "bad" is pretty funny. People on retail aren't all going to be try hards like the few thousand people on every private server. You are going to kill them in seconds with gear.

---
That is a good point too, and one that could be said 'stays true' the best. Like you said, Classic is a time capsule, so it could be argued that acknowledging things like Arakkoa, Pandaria, the Gorian Empire, and so forth would even be something akin to loot trading and sharding, albeit on a much smaller scale that would only affect a niche audience. Still, this is an interesting discussion, and one that I'd like to see explored further in the future.
---
I'm not looking for an answer right away, though. Far from it. It would be impossible to reach a consensus right this moment, but I do feel it's an important discussion nonetheless. On the one hand, you have the intriguing mysteries surrounding Azeroth in 2004. What else is on Outland? What are the Old Gods? What is happening in Kul Tiras? On the other hand, we have lore developments that may have likely been common knowledge in hindsight, but were not invented yet at the time.
---
Regardless of what happens, this has been an interesting discussion. Your time capsule point has made me at least reconsider my stance, but would still like to see a consensus reached by the time Classic launches.
---
Eh, I've been in enough situations where tanks dropping to less than 100 health but surviving meant that that extra bit of health made the difference. Shouldn't happen, won't happen much in better guilds, doesn't parse as well as that extra tps under the right circumstances, but all that being said, extra health is never a bad thing.
---
It's deleted because I don't want to be associated with a retard. You dont remember what you commented on buy you know you didnt make a mistake. You are delusional.

---
Sounds good, I’m UK based and after rolling several 60s over the last couple of years will be going ally come classic. 
---
I don't think you know what "chose" means. They also qualified their "choice". This is about streamers and their content. The streamers/influencers don't want long queues with AV's that don't end. Same reason we will get cross realm BG's. Asmongold means more to Blizzard than we do and his puppets that he "spotlighted" and hosted and made relevant have already defended for cross realm BG's and tried to spin it as a good thing.
---
61 hp over 18 sec I belive
---
Sounds right, my first character (warlock) took 13 days played
---
You can user the new graphics in classic wow when it releases.
---
Why would I? No need for it. Also hunters can't wear maces.
---
I feel like thats honestly a valid concern with some of the way i see people talk about raiding in classic. "dont expect ot get a raid group as a ret pally" "you arent going to be invited if your a night elf priest" etc etc. Which is kinda shitty, because you WILL find a raiding spot SOMEWHERE regardless of what you choose to play, only difference is how far the team might get in a certain period of time and thats okay.
---
You think I care about the 500-1000 autistic people with no jobs that try to rank 18 hours a day for 3 months every year, but I don't. I don't want classic balanced around them or streamers. Cross realm BG's caters to them, high pop caters to them. To hell with them. Streamers have modern WoW they helped ruin. The people playing 18 hours a day need psychiatric help or their mom and dad to kick them out of their house. They should never be catered to.
---
You miss understand
---
I am not saying that troll makes the difference between losing aggro and not. Not at all. I'm saying that no matter what guild you are in, the troll racial is superior. It's not a big deal, but it is superior.
---
&gt; I'm worried the phases will go too fast, catering to people who plan on no-lifing the game. 
---
What have we seen the past 10 years in WoW? Blizzard have progressively upped their handholding game from each expansion to the next. My money's on longer phases to accommodate everyone and also make more money from subs in the process.
---
Not to be confused with Hobss Kappa
---
https://youtu.be/T6V15a0dzbk
---
The longer the better. I will play Classic until the day I die so there is no hurry ;)
---
I have the opposite worry. I fear that the delay between phases will make the content feel time gated in the same way that retail wow feels time gated.
---
Well its confirmed for summer 🤣
---
Phase 1 won't last long at all. We're talking a month or two 3 at max. But phase one is just pre diremaul and world bosses. It's not a big content release at all. Maxing at 3-4 month in won't be be an issue.
---
&gt;catering to people who plan on no-lifing the game.

Catering to hardcore is one of the main reasons why people prefer classic.

Ideally they'd split bwl and world bosses and release world bosses as a stand alone phase 1 to 2 months after launch.

I remember watching those videos back when YouTube actually looked like the screenshot he showed, those were the days!

So many great memories...

Summer is that date in many places.

Go hard with consumables, PvP mitigation gear, and MCP’s and you’ll do just fine. AQ is where you get most of the good gear, but you can pick up some BiS items as early as level 42.
---
Taurens look less like a polygon explosion now, in my opinion. Yeah, the faces are a bit *too* animated, but at least the female tauren have *abs* now.
---
Better textures for the fur, as well.
---
I just secretly hope this game never actually releases so I dont have to deal with deciding what I want to paly. I got no closer to it since the announcement. Literally have no fucking idea.
---
&gt;Nah fam. It is a mobile game. The design philosophy won’t work as a PC game, especially not for RPG-starved Diablo fans.
---
Have you just ignored what actiblizzard has become over the last 8 odd years?
---
Nah, subbed in dec' 04 and there were tons of those add-ons and it was heavily talked about in game
---
TBF those people have a right to play too, however, you also have a right to remove them from group/raid/guild if they are a detriment. Ive found over time those types keep to themselves, just as casuals try to keep to themselves and hardcore players try to keep to themselves group wise. 
---
Personally for me, im not even concerning my self on if im even going to get to level cap (theres a really good chance im just going to spend hours fucking around in winter spring or something doing god knows what like i did in vanilla) But i also recognize people around me might not want to progress as slowly as i likely will and will give them the option to not play with me as a result
---
Was this in the demo?
---
I haven't seen any official news as to allude to otherwise...
---
Point to me on the doll where a streamer touched you 
---
Sad but true 
---
Out of all the guilds early recruiting I'm surprised how many have early raid times. As people with lives now and in some cases families I expected later raid start times. We will see I guess.
---
I dont get what the OP is trying to say.. 
---
 the video is mediocre. A couple raids in azshara. That's not a big deal.
---
At the same time the meme '_you think you want but you dont' defeats any argument promoting no cap. 
---
I'm just confused? Or the OP is an idiot?
---
you mean capture Warcrsaft's dated models, and style? The colours are the exact same between shots. Just better textured.
---
Would be nice if there was a vintage vanilla action bar with the eagles skin for ElvUI, playing Classic with such a garishly modern UI would feel really weird to me.

---
Healthstones are not so bad, not too many people want them. Summoning on the other hand is very much wanted. I always went into a raid with 40+ soulshards just to get me started (made the 32 slot epic bag) and make new soulshards from the raid trash.

Fire spells are generally not in the PvE rotation. They are however very much used in PvP. Immolate is a good DoT and soulfire melts faces (succubus charm or fear + soulfire was a, quite literal, blast).

---
It was in the demo
---
&gt; Catering to hardcore is one of the main reasons why people prefer classic. 
---
yet vanilla was so good as it was with long phases like the 8 months before bwl
---
I'm not really worried about raid dps, warrior indeed do well at all content stage. It was mostly about 1v1 wpvp, where warriors don't shine as much until AQ. Aren't you worried that paste AQ, a lot of 1v1 become very tight for rogues, and at the same time wpvp is in decline compared to earlier patch?
---
Completly agree on hunters' potential in PvP, that's why they're so interesting to me, especially their flexibility wpvp/BGs. However I'd disagree about their outplay potential, i'd still rank rogue and possibly mage above. And as I said, as a hunter if someone really wants to kill you (bursting you with skull/FAP) there's not much you can do.
---
But yeah at this point it's either rogue for wpvp, hunter for overall pvp or warrior for instanced pvp (but it's a shame to play classic and not do wpvp imo) and overall OPness in end-game gear. With doubts relative to how fast they can gear up for pvp/pvp scaling/gold making for pvp respecs.

Ohhh ok. I thought you were trying to say we dont want caps or we do want caps? Just the meme from blizzcon makes things really confusing. Should just put up a video next time without that. It's just a controversial meme. And there are ppl out there that dont want caps, but majority of us do so.

“But it scales with spell damage, generating more AoE threat than a warrior would!”
---
Not very. Bosses hit you so hard that you can sustain rage-fueled abilities which can't glance , So that's the greatest advantage of edgemasters gone. In addition, the gauntlets don't have any defensive stats like all the tier set gloves. 
---
I love their little digging animation
---
Even more as a gnome.
---
You don't need the tone that this community often has to be heard, luckily there are plenty of reasonable people actually making proper arguments about the decisions that they believe blizzard should change. 
---
Blizzard has now shown plenty of times that they do in fact listen, and that they are not following the same priorities as on their "normal" games. 
---
I believe they deserve to be trusted by now with this project, now blindly trusted, but at least to have the community being a bit appreciative rather than assuming that they are found to do everything wrong. 
---
But yeah, I know I'm weird by preferring to keep a decent tone, and that I'd be naive to expect everyone to behave decently online. 
---
Looks like Chinese RPG. Gimme my Vanilla not this crap.
---
5-6 months, first one has to be long to allow levelling imo
---
I've been slightly anxious finding one that suits the second shift life. I'd be game for a raid to start as early as 7 am, or one that starts as late as midnight. My sleep schedule will be prioritized around which one I manage to find.
---
I wish there were more options in the poll. My desire would be for it to mimic retail i.e. No cross server BGs but then in the equivalent of 1.12 (in classic that being Phase 6) add cross server BGs.
---
So my answer would be "Yes, but not at launch of Battlegrounds".
---
I'm guessing you won't have enough 60s for blizz to feel like it's time for more content until at least 2 months in. Either way the min maxers are going to be prepping for the next phase and hoarding mats or just plowing through it. I don't really get the appeal of that but I guess it doesn't make much of a difference to casual players going their own pace either way.
---
Yes, search on YouTube 
---
Edit: I guess I might end up playing on very different hours. So a class or a specc that gives me an opportunity to do something solo that's enjoyable and maybe doesn't rely to heavily on gear acquired in Raids. 
---
That has it backwards. Once they got past 3 ghz (and that was about 2003), heat started becoming a problem that regular (consumer) designs weren't able to handle. And that's when they started packing in 2+ cores
---
That's fair
---
Create a shaman, lvl as enha and if u want to heal do it when u hit lvl 60.
---
As it will take me about a year to lvl to 60 I hope blizz will be slow to release each stage.
---
But that's a bit selfish. Anything will do I have to the end. 
---
I bet on one patch every 3 months. Except for the second patch, after 5/6 months. It means patch 6 after 18 months. Seems about right. 
---
Ah man ... old Orgrimmar, really looking forward sitting on top of the bank again :^)
---
the paladin strike system was in vanilla at some point
---
Well, let's look at it like this. Suppose you play in a fairly casual guild that happens to have a quality tank. Tank is always ahead on threat by miles over the dps he plays with. Any extra tps coming from berserking is wasted in this case because it makes literally no difference if the dps aren't pushing threat cap to begin with. Fringe case? Maybe, but so are elite guilds where every point of tps matters, compared to the overall population of people who will be playing classic. Again, I'm not disputing your assertion that troll make the overall best tanks under ideal circumstances, I agree that they do. My comment was meant to put some context into when certain racials matter more in certain situations, relatively speaking.
---
&gt; I'm talking about fast reporting bots, hackers, gold sellers
---
&gt;people safespotting
---
Isn't it Blizzard's job to deal with that?
---
&gt;spammers
---
Just ignore or they get like a 5 min mute if they spam general chat 10x in a row
---
&gt;Your argument also ignores the fact that the ignore list has a cap
---
Just increase it then.
---
I just really really dislike giving that power of spam-reporting people to faceless nameless people with zero accountability, and it has not been a success in any game I have ever played. The best solution is just to promote the use of the ignore function, and just don't play with people you dislike.
---
So you admit you deleted your post to cover up for a lie.  How do you expect to have an opinion when you deleted the question?
---
He posted "Beta soon" several times when the Beta was half a year away
---
realm list so we can plan and choose
---
Short answer? No.
---
Long answer? No.
---
Well to be fair it took 6 months for world first ragnaros kill so 8 months actually seems rather short. 
---
You bet that shit ran *Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation* smoove as hell 
---
Extreme fringe case. Even in a super casual guild a full defense tank wouldn't do enough threat. 
---
Yes 
---
"People don't stay rested long in my groups."
---
No shit!
---
So very cool.
---
&gt;The problem is nazis and other scum of the earth roaming free in general chat in a game that children play.
---
And probably 9/10 of those people are those children that the censorship is supposed to "protect".
---
Squenix does make it easier due to having a content release schedule you can mostly set your watch by for FF14, so just saying Summer would be a safe bet already since the previous two expansions came out around the same time in June (23rd for HW and 20th for Stormblood). June 25th for Classic means it gets in before the early access period for preorders that begins on the 28th, July 2nd is the day of, and July 9th is one full week after.  
---
Depending on how long testing for 8.2 takes, you could argue they'll do that "in response" instead, but I still think they would probably make some attempt to get Classic to launch alongside a major patch... and it would make more business sense to have both out around then anyways considering FF14 is arguably their biggest competition in the MMOsphere.  
---
And with how the fanbase has reacted to the most recent Shadowbringers news (most of it is kinda dumb, imo) it would be a bit of a power play to try to drag people who are now less enthused away from 14 while the expansion kicks off. 
---
oh i want high population for sure :) 
---
Id play a high pop international server as my first choice, even if it was some more ping. International was so fun on nostalrius, was always something popping at an hour of the day.
---
I remember levels a Druid in 7 days and 14 hours, in 1.1.
---
But it took me almost 2 months and a half at least.
---
I don’t need to play the game if a streamer is doing it. I can just pop on and watch them.... there wAs another medium like this, I just wish I could remember what it was called. You would show up (until they invented something that let you do it in the home) usually pay, and watch someone do something on a screen for a few hours. Nope can’t remember the name of it but surely that’s what this is like. 
---
Anywho I’d rather play and experience the content with people who are wanting to play themselves, not play with a bunch of people who only play because other people are watching them. It changes the whole game...
---
I don't understand why people have something against wanting higher pop servers.
---
Like it's impossible for blizzard to say, implement some servers with higher caps than others so that people can pick what kind of cap they want? Whaaaaat blasphemy! 
---
I shared facts and never posted any opinions you idiot.
---
You lied is all you did.  Why do you think it's ok to lie?
---
That's like asking me to swim through shark-infested waters. &lt;_&lt;
---
Is this a cry for help?
---
Incorrect, you trinket the 5 combo point kidney shot that comes a few globals after. 
---
I remember during BC seasons you could purchase the honor gear before actually being able to wear it, which meant a fun strategy for PvP gearing was to stay in the 60-69 bracket and farm every level 70 honor item, then once you leveled to 70 you had full honor gear already and could skip the tedious PvP phase in which you get farmed by fully equipped level 70s because of low gear.
---
I neeeeeeed a questhelper or I will be forced to learn what stuff "northwest" and "east" means.
---
I still have a pending friend request on steam he never accepted. I loved his vids.
---
Definitely 
---
As others have stated it depends. If you mean in raids they are pretty useless because so much in molten core and parts of black wing lair are fire resistant mobs
---
Because I'm older than 5 you retard.
---
Makes you wonder if warriors didn't need shields, why did everyone hate druid tanks.   I as a druid tank, had way more dodge, hp and armor than a warrior in shield.  The only advantage the Warriors had were shield block and a few more cooldowns.
---
But also, I do remember farming world buffs even before away opened, I was rich from selling flasks on my server, had tons of black lotus.  
---
We were farming potions, elixirs, tubers, flasks, etc.    I remember we would go in groups to get that you'd str buff.  We'd do lbrs runs to get fire resistant buffsfrom mind controlling mobs
---
Often times I watch these videos, and wonder what game they played.   .
---
pfUI only works for 1.12 and the dev said he wouldn't port it to Classic.
---
Warlock
---
I'd honestly play with 4-6k. 
---
A 12k population just felt like retail crossrealm bullshittery. No, community cohesion. You could do 10 stratholme pugs and not meet the same people twice. 
---
Not sure what all was known back then, but it's entirely possible that was after they showed off all the new stuff coming in Legion, meaning it was used to try to give credibility to his lies. That's kind of how the famous "Zone List" hoax worked.
---
None is saying that they expect pre 1.12. People are simply arguing what they prefer and what they would want. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
Battlegroups has it ups and downs. It fixes pvp on low pop servers and faction inbalanced server, but at cost it can hurt the community feeling. Ultimately the most logical choice is to have no battle groups as the standard, and introduce smaller battlegroups on servers with either low population or faction imbalance, and try to balance these groups so that we have a healthy BG scene on all servers. 
---
so you dont have much time
---
you want to pvp and raid
---
how will you have time to farm the gold for respec? beside key preraid bis for the warrior
---
mind you its quite a mediocre farmer
---
you want tier gear for pvp, right? u wont get it unless u tank and its hard to be tank as a casual
---
Stunning!
---
There is hardly 3 streamers total m8. Back to wishful thinking
---
all signs point to warlock 
---
Likewise, it would be sad to massively outgear DM by the time it comes around :/
---
But are you implying he would if he was a troll with berserking? Because I'd have to disagree with that. This argument was never about going full defense gear or not, it was about the difference the berserking racial makes on your tps. And for most non-hardcore guilds, that one racial will not make the difference between your tank being able to hold threat or not, more than likely there is plenty of other things to fix first (such as actually doing your rotation correctly, putting on the proper gear, and so on).
---
Good stuff.  Was a dwarf warrior back in vanilla but I’m going into classic as horse for the new experience.  I was torn between warlock and hunter as I haven’t played either to max level but I think I’m convinced now to make a orc or troll hunter.  
---
Wow you went to the length of digging out your childhood photos to make a meme. I'm impressed.
---
#no changes, but one change i dont see how any1 could mind is the **Option** to play with whatever graphics you want. As long as vanilla ones are available.
---
If you don't have a lot of time to invest, I would stay away from warrior. You get what you invest into it.
---
Warlock is one of the best classes for people who have limited to play imo. You can pvp and pve with the same spec (SM/Ruin), it's not the best for either, but good enough for both. Leveling is super easy, and there's always demand for locks, both for pvp and pve, especially if you're alliance.
---
Holy moly the undead model looks terrible
---
You are not listening. I'm not saying that troll will make the a huge difference, not at all. I am saying that no matter the circumstance, a troll is going to be stronger than a tauren, maybe by a bit, maybe by a lot, maybe by a slight margin, but no matter what, they will be better.
---
That's really different from saying; "MMO from 15 years ago that, upon first glance, has aged extremely poorly..."
---
Which just isn't true. Anyone seeing it knowing it's from 15 years ago would very doubtfully say it has "aged extremely poorly." BFA isn't even *that* much nicer graphics wise... Idk, maybe you mispoke, or didn't think it through, but this is definitely an MMO that *has* aged well graphics wise. Look at other games from 15 years ago, or other games given the #15yearchallenge and see how it holds.
---
I couldn't even get into a capital city aside from 1-4am server without freezing. I feel your pain
---
Obviously having higher poly models is a nice upgrade, I'm not denying that. What I'm saying is the rework also changed the flavour of the faces, making them less agressive overall. They could have upgraded the poly count while keeping the initial intent of each face. 
---
For example, [orc males](https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/OrcMaleFaces.jpg)/[orc females](https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/OrcFemaleFaces.jpg) and [undead males](https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/october/UndeadMaleFaces.jpg) all look the same to me now, smooth and bland, while some used to look very angry and aggressive and would make your character trully recognizable.
---
Ah yeah, the famous 40yard draw distance. I remember that. Getting charged from a barely rendered warrior was the pinnacle of pserver PvP.
---
Thanks. Why esp if ally? I've always played human warrior but if I'm going warlock I figured i'd go orc since their racial is so fucking OP in pvp (plus I like how they look) 
---
Should I play human lock?
---
Hey Mumfo, you mean from the unwritten rules episode right? I think the guys did mention interrupting a cast bar but not nodes, definitely would have been worth a mention and a laugh haha :p
---
you could also consider Druid or Paladin
---
You can play daggers the entire content cycle. The thing that blows with daggers is how weak it is for solo farming. With no front stabbing in classic it makes it kind of weak. Combat swords doesn’t care which arc you are on for the most part and just kills shit quicker.
---
Overwatch released in June if I remember correctly.
---
Imagine being you. That must suck...
---
One of the coziest locations, nice forest+sea+mountains aside from all those Azeroth rumbles
---
I spend so little time in new orgrimmar it's still the old one in my head lol
---
Not going to play on classic but on a upcoming pserver:
---
The plan is to play an orc fury warrior, most likely 2hander and do pvp about 50-50 priority between pve and pvp. 
---
How about SoO lasted too fucking long. It was a good Expansion and Mechanics, but the very beginning was meh and SoO lasted too long.
---
Thanks so much for listening, appreciate it!
---
Looks like the magic from your weapons have dissipated over the years.
---
Yup
---
No I get that and I don't disagree, I'm saying that for the bottom 80% of raiding guilds or whatever have you, that difference between the troll and tauren will have 0 impact. It's a minmax thing that exists in every case, but is not going to be noticably impactful in non-minmax guilds.
---
I actually hate new undeads. It's hard to explain but they feel so different after the new models. Their casting animation isn't exactly the same nor is the way they run. I can't play one now
---
There's always a lack of locks on alliance due to horde being 50% undead. 
---
You'll have to deal with WotF, but in return you'll have pallies on your side(great for pvp and pve) and you get easy raid spots.
---
But orcs do have the best racial for locks though.
---
That super neat!    
---
After reading your update, I downloaded the software to mess around with, and I have to say that I have no idea how you did that. I see the subzone names at the bottom in Noggit, but don't know how you did such a detailed job. Do you have any tips? I want to mess around with it.
---
Noticably? Probably not, no. That's what I said by &gt;maybe by a slight margin
---
Were speaking about story, mechanics and design from ToT to SoO.
---
The main issue IMO is the SoO took too damn long.
---
I think we're mostly in agreement then.
---
thanks for replies. what are you rolling?
---
&gt; The thing that blows with daggers is how weak it is for solo farming
---
good thing they have ways to farm gold in dungeons that dont really require kills
---
and open world normal mobs should be easy to kill
---
Or we could just do without addons for one hot minute.
---
Warrior cuz no life...
---
Man, Jintha'alor. Everyone does it, but it's like an outside dungeon, but with PvP sprinkled in sometimes just to spice it up. Fun, but frustrating at times for sure.
---
&gt; great game/expansion again,
---
Id say at least 2 good xpacs in a row
---
Not needed for Warlocks since they have the Underwater Breathing ability.
---
Go farm the crusader recipe as daggers, than do it with swords. Come back at me and tell me which farm was faster. 
---
Yeah, they seem fine when it's animated... Maybe I took a screenshot when it was faded out a bit.
---
They're still there, same exact weapons with their original Crusader and +6 agi enchants.
---
Absolutely agree. They did get a few things right and everything else wrong with the upgrades.
---
The absolute worst offender is the new Night Elf Male walking animation. It's disgustingly stiff and plain compared to the old animation, lacks personality.
---
All the new animations suck. 
---
Ah i see.  I was more refering to wow. I hope it comes early spring/summer,  but I have a feeling it wont
---
Mmm, yeah, I see what you mean now. Looks like Orcs learned the art of Dentistry. XD
---
Not true, asmon is rolling pve, classicast is going pvp, and nixxiom is gonna play EU as far as I know.
---
True. 
---
Like I said in another post. I will spend the 1st hour when servers open up on saving cool names on various servers. Then after an hour I will pick the lowest pop realm on US-East PvP. In the first hour the streamers and their horde of twitch bots will pick a server so it's best to just wait 1-2 hours and save yourself years of pain. 
---
No changes that weren't in vanilla at some point. People have their own preferences within that.
---
The idea that #nochanges players wanted a strict 1.12 patch is a misconception and a silly one at that. Not since #blacklivesmatter has a pretty straightforward hashtag confused this many people.
---
I remembered BC launch, it was a blast. The relms were much smaller than pservers, and it all seemed to sorta work out.
---
Exactly. Let's take the largest wow streamer the last few years who constantly brags about ninjaing guild banks and screwing people over. Why would any game developer want a market of people who idolize a sociopath in a MMO? They are going to ruin it for the people who actually want to play a MMO. You would think Blizzard learned this with Overwatch and a playerbase so horrible that the population fell off a cliff. Activision just cares about the quick buck though and not the long term. It's why WoW is a bad game now. They saw island expeditions as another "esport" and stream content. It was never made with FUN in mind. Blizzard games are designed for and buy influencers now per their own head of community development.  It's why new Blizzard games are all bad. Blizzard games used to be made by gamers for gamers. People who played games instead of watching them be played. People that said arena was a mistake because a esport should never be pigeonholed into a MMO. 
---
 [https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/13/blizzard-arenas-were-a-mistake/](https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/13/blizzard-arenas-were-a-mistake/) 
---
The only way we will get old Blizzard back is for people to finally realize streaming is stupid and has harmed gaming far more than it helped. Single player games are dying because streamers play them and people feel they don't have to. MMO's are now a wannabe esport toxic waste dump with a tiny fraction of players who will buy a piece of crap Razer Naga (that sucks in all other games) to play a game made to cater to a minority with focus macros that cuts 99 percent of the community out of "real pvp". The funny thing is you didn't even really raise the skill cap. Without focus macros you had to be quicker and more accurate with pointing. The only skill there is totem stomping now. All you did was require a stupid mouse most gamers will never buy which kills your player base due to a focus ability that was put there because people kept whining about skill, when all they really wanted to do was specialize in a instance event that wasn't relative to the rest of the game to secure their dominance. 
---
So streamers/esports cut people out of pvp and in pve they separated friends based on dance dance revolution mechanics and a rotation that changes every few patches in pve. Time spent meant nothing and you were REWARDED for leaving friends and family behind to progress. Then they wonder why the community is a dumpster fire. 
---
Content makers were fine. Streamers are a cancer.
---
Nixxion and TipsOut are rolling Horde and asmon,esfand,SS are going alliance on same server but not 100%. 
---
Nixxiom also said he has an "off-air" main he keeps private, so maybe that will go on EU server. But I am 99.99% he said he will roll horde with Tips on his streamer character. 
---
I had nearly the same experience. I used macros to lower my settings beyond the lowest bounds. It was good for a few FPS. 
---
No. The game has been horde-biased since Cata but they started working on the alliance zones first in classic and it shows. I mean humans alone get westfall, duskwood and redridge while 3/4 horde races are just tossed into the barrens. They have better flightpaths though. 
---
Which is exactly what he said, lmao.
---
&gt; With doubts relative to how fast they can gear up for pvp/pvp scaling/gold making for pvp respecs.
---
Are you currently playing a vanilla server? If not I'd suggest it just to remove any question - you don't want to decide you picked the wrong class after 20-30 days /played.
---
To me there is zero doubt, I have both a War and Rogue, and tested them when I was struggling to decide on a main between the two - when both were in prebis blues, the Warrior was 10-15% stronger then the rogue in clearing a set path / group of mobs (this was timed and averaged over several runs without using any big CD's).
---
Now my rogue is full epics, mostly T2, with some T1/ZG - and it actually feels about the same as much much worse geared Warrior which is in 1/2 MC gear (notably BRE) and still 1/2 bis blues. In PvP the Warrior feels significantly stronger - and in both PvE and PvP cases the warrior would benefit much more from having a healer.
---
Point being I think the only time gearing should really be a concern for a warrior is in the greens / leveling stages - from the time you hit 60 and start getting any kind of good blues or epics whatever gap you were lagging will be caught up almost immediately, and only gets better from there.
---
Seriously the *only* reason I'm going to main Rogue is for the stealth skills and its WPvP meme potential. (For perspective I'm also going to level a hunter to camp roofs in Gagetzan, FD to lure neutral guards and a Spriest to MC people into lava or off boats in BB - I'm *that* guy). Without stealth / vanish *for memes* I'd never touch Rogue.
---
Anyway, GL dude.
---
Unlike dungeons and raids, I have no control over when the Horde decides to queue up for a fight. I don't want to waste a third of my game-time fishing mud snappers near the battlemasters when I could be slaughtering them in back-to-back Arathi Basins or all-day Alterac Valley matches. If I end up on an Alliance-heavy server, I want at least a small battlegroup available to mitigate the faction imbalance.
---
It opens the question of: Where does it stop? Some people want higher caps, some people want vanilla caps. Some people also want older AV, some people are fine with 1.12. Some people want different itemization, some want talents to be true to patches, etc. etc. etc.
---
It comes down to: you can't please everyone. The best thing to do then is to stick close to 1.12 where possible.
---
If you've no interest in that type of server, fair enough, but it costs you nothing for the option to be available to those who would like it.
---
But hey, way to be a dick about it.
---
You might be right about nixxiom but I know with 100% certainty that asmon is not playing on the classicast server. He's said it himself, classicast have said it. Asmon is going pve. 
---
All I can say is that the last time I leveled a shaman on a private server I would start to get whispers at lvl 40 with recruiters asking if I was going to raid at 60 ;)
---
But if I was you I think i would make a druid (I will make a shaman in Classic). Druids are really fun as a casual player. You can stealth around in the world and have fun (on pvp servers) and you can tank dungeons or be a dps or healer and if you raid there will not be many druids competing for gear.
---
Using WF rank 5 and 4 while DW allowed you to bypass the ICD for a while, probably what you're thinking of.
---
Seeing how many unique players are active on each server for both Horde and Alliance would be pretty nifty.
---
So long as this prompts people to aim for balance rather than one-sided factioning.  Could be a two-edged sword, I suppose.
---
Definitely this. I like asmon but his following will definitely be a giant cringy pain in the ass to level alongside with. 
---
Mage, and Hunter. 
---
Do I need to be a curmudgeon who flames anyone who uses math or dedicates more than 24 hours a week to the game?  
---
Maybe. It’s so long ago that it’s more likely I’m misremembering or that I didn’t know what happened when it did happen. 
---
chooooleeee noooooovaaaaaaa
---
Depends how they distribute the game and what options they give to players regarding graphics.
---
All I can say is that the last time I leveled a shaman on a private server I would start to get whispers from recruiters at lvl 40! asking if I was going to raid at 60 ;)
---
Really? You must not have played much. The 3 or 4 servers we were linked with had tons of regulars.
---
It’s literally the other way around. On private servers alliance has been dubbed as the easy mode faction. 
---
Crossrealm battlegrounds is going to be a necessity if we don't want long queues. In the long run, the playerbase will definitely shrink and local queues will start getting way too long. 
---
I interpret "no changes" the same way you do. The people who act like "no changes" means 1.12 exactly how it was are stupid people who think they're clever.
---
Mage.  Warlock. 
---
Turtling isn't why people want old AV.
---
Because tanks these days know how to get a lot of threat which allows fury warriors to not even worry about aggro. 
---
Lightning bolt looks like utter trash now.
---
That isn't the Hobbs I know of when it comes to WoW
---
What really ticks me off is that female nelf boobs no longer shake in any of the new animations that I recall.
---
I'm rolling a mage named "MuffinButton"
---
that's a cool RPG idea.
---
Great video as always Frost! Can't wait to start my adventure in Azeroth all over again!
---
Everyone will play at their own pace — the phases have the largest effect on those more hardcore. It’s not like if the first phase last six months, you’ll end up raiding with folks who hit 60 in two weeks.
---
Personally, I don’t really care how long they last as long as it doesn’t hold up my progression. I’d prefer them be shorter as I don’t see a downside.
---
Why do people think adults didn't play WoW from the beginning? I was in college during vanilla and I was one of the younger people in my guild.
---
This was my first green weapon as a Mage back in 2005. I got the beast slaying enchant ( red glowing ) on it and thought i was boss. 
---
Good times
---
Anyone remember the dogwhistle that summoned the pet guardian from SM? I member :)
---
I'm looking forward to \[The piccolo\]([https://www.wowhead.com/item=13379/piccolo-of-the-flaming-fire#comments](https://www.wowhead.com/item=13379/piccolo-of-the-flaming-fire#comments)), that was always fun.
---
Thanks for the research! Can forget and report.
---
who cares
---
do brd pickpocketing or rfd to disenchant boss loot
---
You really think blizz should go out of there way to help people develop addons prior to release? Why? If you need addons that badly then wait a couple weeks before you start playing.
---
 Hunter
---
You can wait until we're good and ready for you, Alliance scum.
---
But seriously, cross realm BGs make sense and would be not be a change. There are always pros and cons but this would seem to tick the most important boxes.
---
If you can’t do that on retail then it’s not going to be possible. They’ve made it pretty clear that the UI stuff will be what it is on retail.
---
No but I tried rogue on the pserver that shutdown due to drama (and didn't bother making the transfer) and I gotta say I found it clunky but I was basically in leveling combat spec most of the time. Again, coming from retail rogue so I got used for years to combo points on self and fluid energy regen. I know I can get used to classic rogue gameplay and I know it can feel very fluid with the good spec/set bonus/tea/ZG trinket etc. And I know that stealth and vanish are the best spells in the game. I love rogue but once people are geared it can be really tricky against most classes. 
---
I also leveled a hunter to 60 but didn't raid much due to rl stuffs. Enjoyed it though, I hated paladins so i'd go Alliance this time for sure, probably NE because of shadowmeld's meme potential. 
---
I love rogue and hunter but warrior seems like such a better time investment and I'm pretty sure I will at least raid up to BWL. How did you do as a MC/blue geared warrior in solo wpvp?
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I love Jintha’alor.  I wish every dungeon were like that place.  
---
That wasn't clear. And having not really played since TBC i don't know if they're a thing in retail. 
---
Bruh 
---
Always loved this, 5th listening to it now.
---
It is long I know but! I promise you it is worth every second.
---
Bro, i played a low level alt hunter and would use that at the same as an item off a rare from duskwood, it summoned a felhunter guardian. I’d have 3 pets attacking people.
---
not as feral in TBC!
---
Really hope it doesn't release at the exact same time as the new FFXIV expansion (July 2nd), want to play both but I know there ain't enough time in the world to play 2 timesinks properly at the same time uuughh.
---
Yep. Forget about that temporary display of the head of Onyxia on stake in Orgrimmar or Stormwind. The truely elite warlock can preserve a shard of her soul and show it to any who desires to see it. And when tired of such sport, transform it into a health stone and toss it to the nearest stranger willing to accept it. 
---
It worked great. I remember having our own irc for the battlegroup and we had a lot of in jokes about certain premades and such. Felt just like a normal server tbh.
---
It is a good sized toolbox! But since that was all I knew of, I thought i'd ask if there was more. Give me something else to chew on as I decide a main.
---
Yeah, but I also get that to a lot of people, this is a second chance to be first. First to beat x raid, or rank 14, or first to 60. And that's what drives them.
---
Interesting. New Tauren females are the one new model I can't stand, and the reason I leave them off a lot if I ever wind up playing retail.
---
They have some kind of uncanny valley effect for me with the super smooth, flat faces that really creeps me out.
---
This is so low quality.
---
Not really needed by Undead either.
---
OP should just not call it "Fathers...." guild.  I am a guy and it's just too lame of a name, unless he specifically wants only men.
---
Sounds legit
---
Pax sounds like a great place for an official announcement. Puts release 2-3 months after announcement. July is looking good still, unless Pax passes without news.
---
Not really. They did use the many free transfers blizzard offered back then however.
---
I recommend you won't make a Reddit guild and instead enjoy the community as you go. You're more likely to find guilds that suit you more, play around your time and form actual communities. That's the beauty of vanilla I remember 
---
Not to say that I'm agreeing with him, but what's better to you?
---
&gt; the limitations of the current generation of console.
---
Which is tied to the advancement of computer hardware. 
---
One does have to keep in mind, however, that the very same reasoning is what lead to all the cross realm bullshit thst eventually destroyed the game (in a lot of people's eyes).
---
While I didn't mind the small battlegroups, since our battlegroup had a great community via irc and the forums, I don't think that was the norm.
---
If you save up enough gold/get a blacksmith to make you nightfall:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19169
---
Then many raids don't care if you're a meme spec because you bring a big raid DPS increase through the proc that they might not otherwise have access to, so keep that in mind.

When did this change come about? Idk, do you have a link to a video? Not doubting just curious

it's the little things

Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
If you have a better name, I would join.   
---
Find a name that doesn't force women to be in a guild called Fathers of X.   
---
Otherwise you are just going to prevent women from joining (even if it's "allowed").      
---
I like the idea of a parents guild. Hopefully you can figure out a better name.  Now if you just don't care that the name will prevent women from joining, or you don't care if it's almost all men, then I think I will pass.
---
You should be able to hovercast using macros in classic. No add-ons needed. /cast [@mouseover]Renew
---
Asmon, Esfand and SS are buying the house, not sure about Tips. 
---
I feel you! I am sooo torn! Mostly because, and I think others feel the same way, this will probably be my last go-round. I have leveled so many characters on both sides. I am thrilled that classic is coming back but I can't imagine doing it multiple times at this point. That's why I think a lot of us are stressing about choosing a side and choosing the perfect race / class combination.
---
Well you dont have to buy the game, it is free with your sub to retail, so I dont see this happening
---
I see, thank you for the answer.
---
Correct
---
If you are prot spec you won’t have flurry though
---
that is strange to me. I think undead is the one they ruined the least. As long as they keep the missing jaw face in, I'm fine. Personally orcs really broke my heart, as I was always an orc fan, but their new face and animations look childish..

Is it correct that the Priest fear (psychic scream?) can't be removed by will of the forsaken?

I was actually in this guild/video when this happened. This was so funny. I will say the shit we did to an 11y/o would not fly today haha. We had about 3-4 other raids with him in chat.

Brings back such good memories
---
I think that's a first on reddit? :)
---
It's a play on founding fathers. It's not because we are all fathers... Maybe you'd prefer Parents of WOW. lol.

No it doesn't. Not everything is a slippery slope.

---
Thanks for the comment. I know how you feel, having to AFK to soothe the baby means a kick from the group which sucks.
---
Because he needs a safe space to spout memes and to discuss the front page of the internet o lf course! 
---
That wasn't the point. Why do you get your high pop servers and others don't get their variations? What makes yours more important of a server? Especially since it's so far from how vanilla was.
---
I would prefer if you found a better name. You just sound completely tone deaf - can't get it that a woman might not want to be in a guild called "Father of X".     
---
It's lame to not acknowledge that some women would not join because of the game.  I guess you just don't care if the name makes some women not join?
---
lol
---
Personally I feel that cross-realm dungeon finder is quite different to cross-realm battlegroups. Though there is certainly a valid argument to be made, I don't think the two are analogous.
---
Besides, there's no slippery slope to be had, since it's an either/or deal. Also there's the fact that cross-realm BGs were a part of vanilla, and cross-realm dungeon finder didn't arrive until the end of Wrath.
---
I replied to your comment above. It's not about being Fathers only. If the guild was called The Fathers of Azeroth and wasn't advertised as a 'parents' guild people would join and think nothing of the name. You are reading too much into it. It's meant to be more like the Founding Fathers (with the pun that there are fathers also in it) seeing as it's a vanilla server launch.
---
Yeah I left shortly after vanilla ended mid-early tbc I think. 
---
No you're going to need to define vanilla. 
---
I spend more time in classic orgrimmar than current day orgrimmar.
---
Definitely not correct. It removes it. 
---
Lol dude...  
---
So the website he is talking about is my website [https://wowclassic.io](https://wowclassic.io). I have just put it online. I am using Oauth to let people login and add their guild or claim a guild that is already listed by me.  
---
I am not a scammer, I was trying to make it easy for people to sign in to the website by using Battlenets Oauth implementation. The only thing I use is the battletag to connect guilds with users, so I can verify a user really owns the guild.  
---
Unfortunately it seems people are really wary of using implementations like this. So I will work on adding the possibility to register with email and password as well.  
---
But now that everyone is here, I am curious what you guys think of the website and what I should add or change.
---
#notmyAzeroth!
---
Lol, jokes aside, it's also a good idea to check the amount of gold you have on your toons. Token prices on EU right now are about 170k. Even if you have enough gold split between characters, you can do the pet flip method and transfer most of it with the help of 1 friend, then buy your token and get it ready for Classic!
---
Dwarf Priest master race!
---
Do you enjoy healing in other games (or current WoW)?
---
This, all of this.
---
Doesn't that also have to do with increased competition as the years went on?  The more WoW succeeded, the more other companies started putting out MMOs to capture some of that market share.  It certainly wasn't the only show in town early on, but much more so than later expansions.
---
Because putting some effort into something people enjoy is good. Putting a lot of effort into something that is conflicting that few enjoy is not good.
---
I understand why you like the name, and what it means.  
---
How are you not getting that the name will prevent women from joining?  
---
Can you answer this:  
---
You don't care if it's mostly men because women don't want to join a guild called "Fathers"?
---
Yes, but only certain things such as water and foliage I think. They won't update models or general graphics, at least not for now.
---
I remember enjoying 5 man dungeons as an alt. I never tried healing in raids tho :) 
---
Useful for big iron fishing pole still
---
Healing in raids for every healer can go from completely dull and boring to really fun and challenging.
---
If you are in a minmax guild that doesnt bring 12 healers to raids where 8 is more than enough you will probably enjoy it and not feel like you could go afk and nothing will xhange.
---
I've played a healer on vanilla PS's for about 4 years and it really oscillated from loving it a lot to playing dps cause i couldnt stand inviting 13 heals where it wasnt needed 
---
"to make money off something"

you don't need to add "of" after "off", ever. 
---
I remember watching this back in the day.
---
Everything about the design aesthetic of Gnomes in Vanilla World of Warcraft suggests we're supposed to be super impressed with their intelligence, engineering and "know how". Yet nothing about their lore &amp; resume backs this up. 
---
For example, despite having nearly the exact same origin story as the Dwarves (former Titan servants becoming mortal from the curse of the flesh), they achieve absolutely nothing until the Dwarves rediscover them right before the second war. Only then with the Dwarves help do they finally build their single city of note. They have 0 other settlements, ever. And then they proceed to lose it from a combination of pure ineptitude fighting the troggs, treason, and simply asinine strategies (nuking their own city!).
---
From there they proceed to full on mooch off the Dwarves, until they finally muster the strength to take back Gnomer, and fail. They then proceed to do literally nothing until this very day. No other playable race is even close to this level of ineptitude. What exactly is it that is supposed to convince us that the Gnomes are actually a smart / competent people? Helping build the Deeprun Tram?
---
It is such gold, it is everything great about the old school ways of the internet.
---
But yeah sadly most of this wouldn't fly today:P
---
I didn’t say they didn’t, I just expressed a concern?
---
I'm going full tank, I might end up pvping when time passes, but tanking for everythibg pve related.
---
Well, most of those "warrior" mains won't get to level 60 probably, and I know a bunch of people wanting to play warrior just cause "he is a beast in pvp", I bet most of those won't get enough gear to shine, I don't think there will be that many warriors when people get to start raiding
---
That food alone makes me want to look for it when Classic comes out. I only have so many bandages...
---
Accurate. Only nitpicks I saw was you want Ghostly Strike in that Hemo spec instead of 5//5 camo but Hemo has like 5 preference points anyways. Other than that spriest is easily geared when blue pvp gear is available. That and Anathema from healing MC and you can crush in small scale pvp. 
---
I would also say the negatives against enhance/ret you have applies to specs like shadow as well. People play them because they are strong in world pvp, 1 v 1 (compared to something like a warrior played by a middling player) and or easy. Not because they are good in ranked BG's or because they are 3k arena players who could do better on a warrior, mage or rogue. They aren't looking to stunlock someone and MLG vanish deathcoils. They are looking to one shot people in lower gear than them. As a ranker you look at it from a different lens. Even rogues are considered bad by most rankers outside 1 of them in one bg doing one thing, but they have their place in different kinds of pvp. Add to this private is like 10,000 constant players with multiple, international ranking teams. Retail WoW is going to be a lot of casual players on the same time zone and when you make premades don't expect much more than the competition afking. The ratio of rankers/tryhards on real WoW and private is big.  
---
The people who ranked in vanilla can confirm this. The idea of ultra competitive bg's and vanilla esports just isn't going to happen. You are going to streamroll pugs, especially on NA and ranking in a premade is going to be EXTREMELY boring. EU playerbase is a bit more try hard so you might get one competitive server there. It doesn't take any value from the list you gave as far as min maxing but I just thought I would throw that out there for the rets/enhances.
---
To be honest I would rather rank on a enhance/ret than a rogue or hunter mage or lock. Why? Because those other  classes raid gear is good (mage tier 1 sucks though). Elemental Shamans are BG gods but they get NOTHING from ranking to the hard levels. It's completely pointless and they HAVE to raid to get resto/ele gear to even be viable. Same with Holy Paladins. Tier 1 and 2 are going to be super faceroll in Classic with 1.12/itemization and 16 debuffs to. So basically the only classes worth really ranking besides warriors (for most people) are the classes you say that aren't good at premades. On REAL Vanilla? That will carry through to who is actually ranking. Private and retail servers just aren't the same type of player. You are going to see nightelves again, trolls again, Undead over orcs, human over dwarves and gnomes. It's a different demographic.
---
"This can't be real"
---
seems like you have no idea since I studying this shit.
---
I do think there is money being left on the table here. Classic, particularly some of the recent communications surrounding it, has earned a lot of goodwill. But the only way to express that is a subscription shared with retail. Let people show how much they love the efforts of Classic in particular. There doesn't need to be any sort of special access or reward, throw in some vintage style cloth map or something and people would be forking money over.
---
Now this part will be less popular, but I think it needs to be said. A small box cost could have been a great tool to stagger launch as well. For the audience that really loves Classic, a 3-day 'headstart' from a Classic box purchase (say like $10) would go along way toward limiting the need for sharding. Retail players and other folks would still get access without the box purchase but just a small time later to help smooth launch population.
---
Druids are average flag runners? Average base defense? Average tanks in AV?
---
This sub calls people crazy when you point out their hypocrisy.
---
Mage and Hunter
---
If u want more info: these are the best gold farmers and you will probably get more peacebloom or whatever per hr by getting gold than by picking it up yourself. Every class has a good gold farms, especially once DM comes out but I suggest mage or Hunter. If you really just want to pick herbs then I suggest Hunter cause the pet can tank or you can feign death to get mobs off you while you mine the node. Of course, you would also prefer to be tauren in that case. 
---
The other consideration you have to make is if u will encounter pvp along the way so bear that in mind. 
---
Yeah I didn't think it was special, so anything that removes fear will remove it?
---
Vanilla was the casual game back then. Everyquest requirted everywhere groupplay so was Dark Age Camelot etc. WoW success was that you could reach 1-60 wihtout grouping. 
---
I think the jokes on you buddy!
---
You have been bamboozled.
---
Saying that you want people banned over being toxic is toxic. You should be banned.
---
I don’t see a lot of upvotes because it’s clear how in denial this whole community is. It’s pathetic, just downvote me sheeps!
---
Trolls are way worse than gnomes especially in vanilla.
---
Classic Pservers :p
---
The only thing egocentric here is supporting a system that benefits your little corner of the game at the expense of everyone else who didn't do shit to contribute to any problem other then choose a faction to play with their friends. 
---
I'm not asserting that a massive imbalance isn't an issue. I'm saying that you can't force everyone else to diminish their experience for your sake, which is what this "system" is designed to do. Find a solution that doesn't fuck everyone else.
---
There’s no convincing these people. They are adamant that the impressionable eyes of the “vulnerable” must be protected from reading mean words, and that the noble masses would never abuse the power of censorship. Just like how nobody ever reports you in Dota 2 for now showing up to a fight fast enough, or using the courier when they wanted to, or a myriad of other petty reasons. And thanks to reporting, Dota 2 has become absolutely racist free to boot. ITS 2019.
---
Shaman was first to come to my mind, for few very simple reasons - everyone wants a shaman to heal their 5man for totems and all pug raids that you stumble upon will want 4 rshamans minimum. Class is stupidly easy aswell but if you wanna be really good at it you can always add some totem twisting to impress ^^
---
&gt; Putting a lot of effort into something that is conflicting that few enjoy is not good.
---
Isn't that what you're asking for? OP is sitting at 0. Seems like *this* is something conflicting that few here enjoy.
---
Ok

As a hunter, where would farming gold be the best?

---
Aah, remember having this on my hunter way back, saved me a fortune on food for my pet
---
They should still be stopped immediately whoever they are
---
Would you suggest Paladin for alliance then? I think that's what I picking as it stand now 
---
I play an enh sham until lvl 30 on private recently and w stacking agility for crits was having a BLAST crushing duels and world PvP. 
---
would you say I was right to use ghost wolf as a way to counter act the no gap closers? I’d usually FS+ ghost wolf (with imp ghost wolf of course) and was doing well with shock+ earth bind totems. Was definitely tricky to play but SO rewarding 
---
Been out of the vanilla loop for a bit. Nice timing for that server for some FRESH testing. I'll leave for Classic but hopefully the community matures there for you too.
---
Chill out there aren’t that many people in this sub in the first place man

Can't wait to MC people into the lava! :D

Created a Discord server to keep us together for now: [https://discord.gg/eq75evx](https://discord.gg/eq75evx) come join us!
---
It is not conflicting in the sense that having high pop on one server does not affect the other. If blizzard was to change talents it would either affect everyone meaning some would dislike it, or it would make the servers confusing and require work. Changing a number does not confuse or require work.
---
Go gnome lock if you roll alliance. 
---
Pros:
---
-Alliance has the edge in pve (your main gearing source, unless u get rank 14 LUL)
---
-Gnome gives intellect passive (pretty good)
---
Cons:
---
-Will of the forsaken which isn't as common as some ppl think - all the good players play orc
---
-If you aren't super good at or committed to the game, it might be hard to find groups because warlocks are pretty weak early on in the classic timeline, at least. 
---
Trolls are the most widespread race in the whole game what do you mean? 
---
&gt; but it was objectively well-designed from a PvE standpoint
---
Compared to Cata? Yes. Compared to Vanilla, BC and Wotlk? No.
---
Old AV didn't last hours because one team decided to be zany and turtle, it lasted hours because the towers doing real damage meant they were worth something on the battlefield so you naturally wanted to defended them. Also, they were a real obstacle so you wanted your team with you when you ran past one or tried to take it. Grouping up wasn't to do an impression of a turtle for no practical purpose, it was because the map forced you to group up and work as a team to accomplish anything offensively or defensively.
---
Oh I'm going classic for sure, just gonna play there for a bit of fun and practice before the real deal.
---
Trolls are the most widespread race in the whole game, what do you mean?
---
Yeah I'm from Melbourne so mine also gets routed through Sydney.
---
It adds about 20ms for me. 
---
Soloing DM North as a hunter can bring in a lot of gold. Especially if you’re enchanting so you can DE the blues 
---
At the end of the day, I think choosing a race for pve other than perhaps weapon skill on melee dps is stupid. Minor gains really. May as well choose off of pvp.
---
Well that's obvious lol.

Eh the last few years i spent playing vanilla I was mostly horde, but afaik allies do take alot of palas to raids for blessings, in 5man they arent as picky tho.
---
Palas are great fun in pvp tho, disgusting but great :D
---
I wish. 
---
Lol dude render distance is so high now that models wouldn't do shit. You can legitimately see the water in Azshara from the peaks of Hyjal, it's nutty. The sword in Silithus starts to draw in when you hit like Desolace, 3 zones away.
---
More power to you, man. I know I'll main a priest, and I'm convinced I wanna be a female human. I just love their model and animations, unlike dwarfs'. If people turn me down for raids just because I can't ward them (which good warriors don't need), so be it. They'll be missing out on some sexeh heals and priests will probably have an easy time finding raids/guilds in general.
---
If they're too short what's the point of even having them?
---
Before dire maul comes out, I'm not sure. It's either farming maraudon or an open world farm like felcloth. You'll have to research that yourself tho cause I don't play Hunter. 
---
Btw, during the demo I never noticed my pet stealing my kills and depriving me of Improved Drain Soul Buff. Maybe they decided that killing blows by pet were to be considered as killing blows by a warlock themselves.
---
I strongly disagree. Vanilla/TBC was mechanically simplistic to the point of boredom. I enjoy TBC, but it's not exactly difficult. Vanilla is obviously braindead easy until Naxx, and even then it's mechanically simple.
---
Like I said, MoP has problems, dailies and poor 5-man content chief among them, but classes and raids were exceptional. Considering that's 80% of what I do in WoW, MoP was outstanding for me.
---
If I recall, world 36 in Falador was where people rioted.
---
It was silly.
---
Thanks for that, I think i'll pick based on my pvp racial preference then because ive been hearing mixed things for tanking.

Release day, release hour release minute release second 
---
Why does that matter
---
BiS is BiS. It doesn't matter who else needs it...
---
Warriors can use berzerker rage to completely avoid fear. Druids can’t. This is a pretty big reason why warriors are essential as tanks for a number of fights. 
---
O.o pre-dungeon BiS list? I'd love to see it
---
Only point to them is to make content easier for more casual players — like DM being delayed so MC is harder initially. But other than that, there is no value.
---
Yes, he talkingn about that priests fear can't be dispelled by pala or priest. 
---
Amazing scenery shots. Love it
---
Same thing, first of all debating if to even roll (cause it will be such a time draining journey), and secondly if yes if to actually roll a warrior for sake of topping meters and being awesome in pvp or to get a druid and be equally awesome in bgs but heal in raids and cry for not owning dps meters :(
---
Always had both on PS past years but I cant escape the feeling that there wont be much time for alts :(
---
Yea I meant as in a raid, well that's interesting. I feel like people could roll on items they don't need, just to sell them for gold to other people in the pug raid. Not sure if that's something that will occur tho.
---
Titan construct &gt; primitive elves
---
Having a server that has talents go through the original iterations doesn't affect other servers that don't, either. And *that* request would make far more sense than yours and OPs does.
---
You can make the same argument either way. The point is that having varying servers (ones that are based around specific non-vanilla content at that) isn't going to be fair for everyone. The only way to be fair is to, again, stick to 1.12 where possible.
---
Intentionally ignoring parts of my post does not prove your argument mr strawman 
---
You are confusing objectively with subjectively
---
They are just a ripoff of all TSR/DND stereotypes that were found in things like Dragonlance, where they were super smart tinkerers but often had contraptions that backfired and were often comedy relief. Just like the pantheon and even the void is a ripoff of Tolkien. Sargeras = Melkor. Broxigar = Fingolfin. Old gods are Lovecraft, probably to make it not look like straight up plagiarism of Tolkien.
---
It's ripped off fantasy in a video game man. The only fantasy that is good in Warcraft at all is Arthas and possibly the love triangle and War of the Ancients with Illidan, Tyrande and Malfurion and they screwed that up so bad in TBC they had to do it again.
---
Make videos on Game of Thrones. More people will care. Here I will give you one to make money with in the next month. Jaime is a nod to the Norse God Tyr as is Anakin Skywalker and they are both deconstructions of a perfect messiah. He loses a hand caging the wolf Bran (Fenrir). He will kill Bran at Ragnarok (Bran will probably warg into the night king as it's the only way for him to die and he "will fly"). Jojen Reed even showed you BRAN's end with his hand (Jaime's) on fire.
---
Tyr's wife in mythology was Zisa and the prophecy in Game of Thrones is that the Azor Ahai/One who was promised will kill his loved one to forge his lightbringer/weapon. The loved one was Nissa Nissa. Cersei's prophecy from the witch is that her little brother will strangle the life from her.
---
Anakin had a viking funeral in Return of the Jedi . Enjoy the 500k views and 300 bucks because people that make theory videos are morons. Buy a new video card with it. 
---
You can also throw in that Jaime/Cersei are the yin/yang and male and female energy and represent the duality of the god in that universe. He is good and evil like pagan Saturn who devours his children. You can also throw in Jaime's dream were it's hinted at that their true father is Aerys which is a play on Aesir which were the Norse gods. The dragon has 3 heads. Jaime, Jon and Dany. 
---
Oh and Sansa and The Hound are "Beauty and the Beast". He's going to bring her back to life with a kiss, that she falsely remembers in the book when he left King's Landing and offered to take her. It's why Sansa will live. She lost her wolf which = you are gonna die, but The Hound takes it's place.

No, you got EXP every time. I know several people, myself included, who made a habit of stocking up on tokens at x9 and just handing in several hundred and just skipping like an entire level or two.
---
The point is for you to figure it out. 
---
I will throw you another one though...
---
Instead of rolling on Dal'Rends which gives you 50 AP and 1% crit and a bunch of pissed off warriors and rogues, there are two swords you can get by quests. One fairly early, Outlaw sabre and one mid forties, Vanquisher's Sword (Horde). I believe Alliance have others at later levels with more AP.  Now with those two swords you het a combined 43 AP but no crit (which sucks) but you also don't make a bad name for yourself. 
---
You couldn't just do it willy-nilly in a PUG led by someone who isn't retarded. It would have to be something that you realistically need.
---
The class you are willing to play for the most time.
---
I really wished they could be separated. Wouldn't want ActiBlizz thinking I'd be paying money to play BfA.
---
Besides, I don't think Classic is free with a retail sub. I think a Classic sub includes retail for free. Just like OSRS membership comes with RS3 for free. 
---
  Anything that is decent at carpentry, depending on what you're farming. Let's say you want to be a cattle farmer just to breed and sell, you will probably need at least 8 acres and the land will have to be fairly flat so you can easily seed the area, otherwise you will incur plenty of cost in feed. 
---
 Anyway, human or dwarf warriors fit the bill for being physically active and strong, however, dwarves are afraid of horses. Everybody knows that. 
---
  So you're going to need to roll a human warrior. Plus perception may help to defend your farm from predators such as coyotes and mountain lions. Which is a very helpful added perk. 
---
  Anyway, once you have your land situation and your livestock figured out, you want to make sure to get a well auger and get that flowing otherwise you're going to be in trouble. 
---
  From there you may want to build the structure of your farm in the highest point of your property. This way if there is a flood you're less likely to be devastated by the water damage. Likewise, debris from any trees or vegetation nearby will have a harder time flying up hill in a storm. 
---
  Anyway, once you have your prime points picked out, use those big muscles to make a steady foundation and continue building! 
---
 Good luck! Keep us updated on your progress!
---
Lol i feel you man, but im not comparing preferences here but their actual resume on Azeroth.
---
I saw new expansion announced - pandas and pet battles. This is what they were spending their time on, and was the selling point. If that was the case, it sounded like they were going in a direction i wasnt interested in. 
---
I love trying to solo The Ancient Egg quest at the appropriate level on my Mage. It took me half a dozen attempts to figure out how to loot the egg in time, but it was a good feeling when I finally did it.
---
This is 100% me.
---
If you wanna heal - druid, if you wanna dps - rogue.
---
The thing is, you said you are insecure, and people WILL make fun of NE warriors and of non-dwarf priests. If you wanna be loved, its simple - dont take those 2.
---
Dont listen to haters, druids are best tank healers in vanilla and they can top meters as well as priests, really player+encounter dependant. Also dont expect to be ditched from 5mans because of no rez, druids are as valid healers as any + there will be plenty dps priests/palas running 5mans.
---
Although many people say they're going to play a warrior... Many will re roll when they're about 25 and it starts getting a bit too grindy for them. 
---
Literally have anxiety over this games release I just cannot wait 
---
That's like two fights out of 20?   And I know they have some reduced spell damage taken.   I'm not talking about that really.   I'm talking about these claims of tanking as a fury warrior without a shield.   If that were true, there wouldn't be a stigma against bears. 
---
Minnesota for me. I'm assuming midwest servers wont have much as far as streamers are concerned either. 
---
I have to be alliance, as I want to play pally. But I'm going to miss horde. And yes, even Barrens chat.
---
Casuals aren't going to be raiding until at least 3-6 months after release. 
---
So DM needs to be held back until after that. And probably up to 3 months after lots of casuals are raiding. Which means 6-9 months after release. 
---
Any earlier and it'll have zero impact on casuals. 
---
Tank and PVP
---
It's gonna be a nightmare, I'm so excited 
---
&gt; just downvote me
---
If you say so 
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
For the third question it's answered, they will use it in starting zones for a limited time.
---
The point is for the casuals to have access to DM whole raiding MC, but make things more difficult on hardcore players. Releasing DM after three months would be fine.
---
Google “I like turtles” meme.
---
Sex Leg
---
Amen
---
Same here. I'm going alliance for this reason. That and I really want to play pally.
---
It's not going to be impossible to raid as ret. Some guild probably will take you, but it's a much slimmer chance of you getting a spot. If you get to 60 fast enough, and get keyed for MC/Ony, put on a friendly helpful face, you'll get a guild. Thing is, this question is asked about once a week on this subreddit. People really want to raid as ret, and that's just on this sub. There's going to be a LOT of ret pallies trying to do the same exact thing. A guild may take 1 or 2 pallies as ret, but the more they take, the harder it will be for the guild to progress (not impossible, harder). If your heart is dead set on raiding as ret, level quick and be friendly as a mafk.

---
Anyone who talks bad about classic wow aren't my friends
---
Well if you wanted you could reduce basically every fantasy faction/character to a cliche or stereotype couldnt you? Thats not really the point. I'm just trying to judge these tiny humans within the context of the Warcraft universe. 
---
Youre definitely right in that the "tinkerers" with comically poor utility/competence is pretty overused. I think they sort of have to pair those personalities together otherwise the alternative is what, a super technologically advanced &amp; genius faction? That'd be broken. So instead what we get is practically an oxymoron type joke faction.
---
And while I'm into Game of Thrones im not really interested in making videos on that universe. I'm all about WoW with all this Classic hype. 
---
Also while this video is pretty cool as far as I remember it it is more of a show of possibilities. You can exactly do this to one target while using all your cooldowns. 
---
I always liked the items you got from Linken's questline in Un'goro.
---
Can't find any valid argument against it and call someone an idiot/troll. gg
---
Im tanking as druid on wotlk PS atm, and i had a resto druid on vanilla before this. I had full tank gear there aswell. 
---
If you think you will get experience near wotlk one you had - sorry to dissapoint you.
---
Yor threat will be decent, you can get awesome hp pool but thats kinda where it stops. You are gonna be pain to heal aswell.
---
On vanilla I tanked ZG and AQ20 really often, that was no pressure and smooth (bear in mind I was really well geared). In BWL I'd say there is a spot as 3rd tank, but you will be dead weight on 2-3 bosses. AQ40 and Naxx we also ran one druid tank, I actually prefered healing him than warriors on some encounters. 
---
Tanked some aq40/bwls myself when we had too many heals, but since im playing wotlk atm I cant imagine myself tanking vanilla without mangle and my 5 cooldowns.
---
If you really wanna roll a druid, you will prob gather healing pieces through tanking your 5mans, and perfect druid is one that doesnt mind respeccing for raid needs.
---
I think saying we want no changes was good because it set the overall tone of what we want. We want a vanilla experience. But in my opinion that doesn't mean that there should not be some qol stuff that doesn't affect the experience or some updated models or whatever. Why not take the best out of both worlds. Things like dungeon finder etc are of course a  hard nope since it really changes the experience but we for sure should at least fix known bugs or make some minor changes that all benefit from. 
---
Taurens are a fantastic choice for both if you go horde side. 
---
I think you should play what you really want. It’s true that warlock will be easier than warrior but you will eventually gear up warrior as well.
---
I am really not a fan of the idea that one should abandon a class they like simply because it takes too much time to gear or it is too difficult.
---
I think at the end the payoff will be greater.
---
This comes from a person who leveled a hunter back in vanilla simply because it was easy, played few days at 60 and then decided to roll what I truly wanted and I was more happy with my crappy level 10 rogue than a level 60 hunter.
---
I did this exact thing for a hearthstone meme with this exact image and it got taken down lol. Still funny
---
Less rage means less dmg, which means that DPS needs to slow down to not aggro
---
Correction, I can't wait for classic WoW because I cant wait to play a game with A community.
---
No one fucking talks in WoW anymore, it is basically a single player game now.
---
Ah sharing the computer with the whole family. WoW was a very frustrating time for my family lol.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Anything that specifically removes fear will remove psychic scream. However it doesn't count as a magic effect so spells like cleanse and dispel magic that dispel magic effects can't remove it. Same thing applies to warrior's intimidating shout.
---
I think you're confused OP.
---
Turtling is the strategy when the players in the BG choose to play defensively.
---
Old AV is when the BG's guards were still sturdier than tissue paper and the push required more coordination than a single player rushing in to cleave tank the enemy general and all four warmasters.
---
First your illiterate I wasnt the guy who initially commented so you never asked me a question. Second how are you going to try to take what I said out of context yes you are free to disagree with something that's how free society's work. That doesn't mean people have to take what you say into consideration. Especially when you have nothing to back your position up. Just as I can say "hey the earth is flat." I have no proof I have nothing to back myself up but fuck it the earth is flat. Well guess what when someone trys to make a decision on whether the earth is flat or not they probably wont take what im saying into consideration. You have the right to speak not be heard. Finally I didn't say what you quoted in the last bit about asking people who are against sharding what their argument is. So you are either a really bad troll or legitimately challenged. If you are legitimately challenged I apologize maybe you should talk to your caregiver before posting stupid shit on the internet.

How does it feel up there on your cloud of superiority?

Ooh that Sword from Viscidus thooo. Ancient Quiraji Ripper or something!

Calling people idiots is toxic. I can’t wait to report you when the game goes live.

I am not saying these guys don't get raid invites, and I'm not saying they don't provide utility that makes up for their (generally considered to be) suboptimal DPS  -- I'm just saying my concern is overrepresentation of warr / mage / rogue / priest because they generally considered to be meter topping, "OP" classes in vanilla. 
---
My point is mainly that I hope for a rich variety of classes and good distribution. I think a lot of guilds DID gravitate towards the "taking enough of these classes to bring the utility needed, then no more" mentality in vanilla by late expansion, and my concern would be a disproportionate skew of warr / rogue / mage because of how they were considered to be the chart-poppingest DPSers. You're right about Druids - it was super easy to get a raid spot because Druids were like 4% of players and you needed b-rez and innervates and other utility -- but my point is, I hope it isn't going to be 4% Druids again.

I remember I had a decent PC for Vanilla, still long loading times and low fps in populated areas but other than that Vanilla ran smooth, I could even launch 2-3 separate clients of WoW. Also dial-up wasn't a thing anymore by that time where I live, so a stable internet connection was no problem.
---
I had the same PC up until mid WoTLK or so. I couldn't do much in WoTLK with that PC. Leveling it could handle, anything else was a FPS RNG, I remember trying to Raid Naxxramas and boy let me tell you, the ground textures were exquisite.
---
Thanks buddy, yeah as far as I know that's an original creation :)
---
This is really awesome. I remember watching this way back in the day. 
---
Would love to do something like this once classic is back. 
---
Do you guys think Paladin would still be the best choice for this? 
---
Best thing that ever happened to to the Gnomes is the introduction of the Pandaren lmao. Good video dude
---
I upvoted you cause I'm a hipster.
---
high quality post
---
honestly i don't disagree it was just the first thing i thought when reading the announcement
---
That’s a good point, thank you
---
Dagger spec is alright overall. For both rogues and warriors.
---
Pre-raid daggers before AV/DM are not that great, but there's good daggers in MC and you'll have to compete against less people than you would as swords.
---
In BWL sword builds get a new upgrade and dagger builds don't.
---
In AQ and naxx both builds get new decent upgrades.
---
6 months... regular players need time to get to 60, then start doing 40-mans
---
Backflip eviserate &gt; stereotypical edgelord
---
Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't think Blizz will ever do this, but why not like release a new classic raid or dungeon or two. The way I see it, there are definite signs that vanilla was supposed to have another big content patch and big balancing-tuning update, but they decided to just save all that for TBC. If the "OG" vanilla team with all these legendary old school designers had continued to fix their work and add, say 1 more raid, some difficult lvl 60 dungeons, and a few class balances and bug fixes, and maybe some AQ40 / Naxx fixes, I am pretty sure people would have loved it and that would have been the ideal state of classic WoW. 
---
I agree, but they will have to keep the phases going at a steady rate in order to keep people playing. I’m just wondering what they’ll do once we get to phase 6 and the game stagnates
---
And yet the mind control cap forces us to dismiss a summoned pet... god I can't wait!

I wish he went more in-depth about spriests in pvp rather than just saying one sentence about their viability since that's what I'm planning on playing hahaha
---
Tips Out!

There is only one "warlock" epic weapon that drops outside of Molten Core: that's the Headmaster's Charge from Darkmaster Gandling in Scholomance. But, Blizzard felt this item should only be included in the game as a joke. The staff has a 1 in 500 chance of dropping, but it's the only Epic staff geared for warlocks. That can drive a warlock mad.
---
I wanted this staff. I wanted it bad. I farmed for it for over three months. I ran Scholomance over 200 times. And this was before the nerf to Scholomance. This was when an average run took around three hours. We got it down to an hour and a half. Over and over and over. I saw countless others get the items they came for, but that damn staff never dropped. 
---
Everything gone downhill
---
I can't wait to get in there and spend my precious money on a bunch of different colored silk shirts. Worth it!

none of this made any sense to me.

The downvotes just proves the point, good job!

we cant hope for the classic wow community to live up to such high standards as the osrs community.
---
I remember going back in BC to pick that item up and then setting it and being like... weee useless. :&lt;
---
it drops from Fankriss.

[Ancient Qiraji Ripper](https://www.wowhead.com/item=21650/ancient-qiraji-ripper)

No, but I haaaaave considered getting them addicted as well.
---
You post about parents in general but then suggest a guild name that starts only with "Fathers"? Wow...
---
Would be cool, but the intention is to recreate vanilla and they are not tampering with code, so all boss behaviors and values are set.
---
Yeah OP is tone-deaf for sure. Feel bad for his partner. 
---
Or when i recap sfgy.   Because im a bitch like that
---
You're an idiot
---
It was you wasn't it?

This guy gets it

Wasnt there always battle groups?
---
Like, 8 realms, and they always fought each other?   I remember always being in the same team with the same people.
---
Hes saying battlegrounds always were cross realm
---
If I was to make a farm I'd probably use Tauren as I'm guessing the milk yield would be higher than in other races and people wouldn't have as many hang-ups eating Tauren steak compared to, say, Gnome steak.
---
If farming Tauren is too political, perhaps Quillboar?
---
For the whores!
---
The future is now, old man. 
---
Yeah. We've actually had "new" orgrimmar longer than the old one. 
---
Sorry, I can break it down for you.
---
My joke was that Azeroth post Cataclysm (as shown in the picture) is not the Azeroth I want and love :P.
---
The thing about tokens was, if you don't have an active subscription or don't want to pay for it, you can use the free weekend now to check all your characters and see if you can put all your gold on one spot (through various methods, including battle pet flipping) and buy a token since they are fairly cheap right now. You can have it ready and waiting until Classic launches, since it will use the normal subscription on your account.
---
For real. If you don't even try vanilla wow then that tells Blizzard that any effort to be better will be futile.
---
I hate new trolls. The run super goofy and the faces do not translate over. I'd be fine with an HD, more animated version of the face my troll was using, but all of the new ones are totally different.
---
Especially male trolls. They run like they're the awkward gangly kid jogging through gym class. 
---
&gt; Summoning a new minion instantly dismisses current minion
---
This is how it originally was, wasn't it?
---
September 30 would give us a whole 2 months to level before summer though. 
---
Meh. I think male undead is one of the only races that came out better post-rework. Them, dwarves, female trolls, and that's about it. 
---
My all time favorite WoW video, and I don’t even play a Mage!!
---
From memory orc and undead female only have 1 casting animation, and most other races/genders have 2. It’s something that annoys me enough I won’t play an undead or orc female caster 
---
I hope they treat it like oldschool runescape and add more classic content while keeping with the vanilla philosophy.
---
I'd just have preferred new models that were just HD versions of the old ones. The WoD models have faces that don't even remotely translate to the old ones for some races. 
---
Read the post, I give a reason why. I really don't think it would put off anyone. It's a play on words.
---
Jokes on you buddy! I knew you would think I'd be bamboozled, but it was just all part of my plan.
---
Oh man that’s the dream, but I won’t hold my breath. I’ve seen people suggest releasing Karazhan or other content that was planned but never released. It will depend on how successful classic is I suppose.
---
thanks
---
Multiple people are telling you otherwise. Are you that arrogant?
---
Someone hasn't been on the official forums if that's your impression of the community. 
---
I doubt the beta would be "start at 1 and get as far as possible in a month." Most likely a weekend with instant 60s. 
---
I honestly think we will see a beta though. Gauging how many people will actually play the game is a really big deal in terms of # of servers, shards, all that shit. 
---
This made me laugh, but stop being a pleb and use direct links from now on.
---
Or the usual parent afk line &lt; brb kid &gt;
---
They even called that "opening pandoras box" ;)
---
6 months for each phase sounds good, with 6 phases you get 3 years of Classic. I would like Blizzard to let the players explore the content thoroughly, and not plan their release schedule based on the hardcore guilds' progression.
---
Your name kinda kills the vibe.
---
Yeah, I hope they see this so they know their work is greatly appreciated.  So many times, dev teams only know the negative because people generally only talk about games to bitch.  If they enjoy the game, they're too busy enjoying it.
---
Yes, but ranks are relative to the rest of the server, if there's 30 min queues then everyone earns honour slowly. It's arguably *better* for grinders in that case since you're missing out on less honour if you're not on 24/7
---
It's not that your ideas are bad. The problem is that it would turn Classic to something that is not Vanilla. That different game may be fun but it will not be Vanilla.
---
If an argument is "pure speculation", it has no predictive value over random chance.
---
Huh? 
---
Yea that's a good point actually. Phase 2 coming out 3-4 months in would allow people like myself a step up when going into MC.
---
Battle of the joke factions for real lol. And ty!
---
Yea, that I assume is the primary purpose for Blizz: utilizing existing catch-up mechanisms.
---
Well it sounds like they got the dwarves to do all the work for them...seems smart, just sneaky smart :)
---
I think 50g respec should be reconsidered, 50g cap will probably influence some players on what to roll. Having classes that never have to respec for pve/pvp/farming while some others have 3 dif specs for those is very sensitive and isnt a fair thing imo.
---
Another thing that still needs to be discussed is player cap, some people want those 12k nostalrius numbers while most seems angry at anything above 4-5k.
---
warlock
---
that was easy
---
Of course not, I wouldn't do such a noobish thing ;-)
---
&gt;including battle pet flipping)
---
Does this refer to selling battle pets? How does one do that and how much do they sell for? I've got a few rare pets like Sir Murkalot and the Baneling
---
Yes. People think it's different but it's been proven to be vanilla authentic.  
---
What's the point of this post then ? 
---
Just to brag that you can make a "no huntard bis list" ?
---
The old looks nicer to me due mainly to the tone, much brighter, calmer and more soothing, sandy, as opposed to the darker, more vivid and stark look of the new one. In the same way that an impressionist painting can look much nicer than a technically more detailed painting which didn't have so much thought put into the overall tone or palette.
---
I've been 60 with warrior before, levelled as arms. It's fun, just a lot more work to squeeze out wins in world pvp and you're crazy reliant on healbots to keep you from being cc'd in battlegrounds.  
---
Hunters, Mages and Warlocks are basically impossible if they know what they're doing and kite.
---
Druids are pretty much the same except you'll usually get a chance to intercept them at least.
---
Rogues that bleed kite and shamans that frost shock kite aren't impossible, but they do have the advantage
---
Paladins and priests you will at least be able to hit, but they'll usually outlast you 1v1.
---
All of the above is subject to the usual caveats while levelling. If you're 30 and have WWA, you'll probably be able to shitblast a lvl 30 priest into the next dimension. But prepare to have uphill 1v1 battles against anyone that knows how to pvp.
---
Ahh, I see. So you definitely are someone who is afraid of getting a ban for getting reported. It all makes sense. 
---
I'm sorry, I'm already foaming at the mouth.  This has to run it's course, so I'll be ready to hear that my concerns are not warranted after several thousands dollars worth of property damage, minor cuts and bruises and a night in jail.
---
That has nothing to do with the question i'm asking.. Troll

Even if you were Australian that'd be wrong.

Ill definitely concede that lol. For me the main thing is this: how do they have literally 0 history prior to the second war?

By this point the Dwarves had not just 1, but 3 separate powerful nations!

ah right, my bad. that's what happened.

Your friend drank 10 litres of coke a week? To put in perspective, that's over a kilogram of sugar.

You're right. I certainly don't want to look at 2004 graphics.
---
Only for the last major patch before TBC
---
Yes because meaningful communities are built in the first 2 weeks in starting zones...
---
Just pointing this out, sorry to say, but that's incorrect.
---
I had, and still have this item, on my warrior. I got it in Vanilla. I read all those posts that say it stacks and you can unequip it.
---
You can't. The aura goes away on everyone the instant you unequip it.
---
I was so awfully sad. I didn't feel bad for winning it, because the group that got it to drop had no caster whatsoever who could use it, but I felt bad because I thought I could help my INT caster friends out. Sadly, no =(.
---
That's assuming we trust Blizz to never add sharding back again.
---
Many of us do not trust Blizz to keep to that stance, especially once they have the precedent of sharding already having been present.
---
As someone with a job and a social life, I dont want to spend 2 of my 3-5 available hours a night waiting in a queue. 
---
Queues won't be present for the entirety of Vanilla, so wait a week and you'll be fine.
---
How the effect works now may not be the same as vanilla, due to changes in game mechanics over the last twelve years. I don’t know for certain but I had this in vanilla and remember it working as it does on private realms now.  If I find a bit of time I will try to find some evidence to support my claims
---
Isn't everything something offensive these days? 
---
Forcing the majority of players to wait a week to play the game because of purists and their slippery-slope arguments is a bad idea, for both the community and blizzard as a company. 
---
Player cap and respec cost should definitely stay what it was in vanilla. 
---
We need gold sinks for the economy to be healthy. We're already gonna have a pretty fucked economy if DM runs and all these different instance runs are gonna be a thing. No need to take *less* gold from the economy.
---
Server population also affects economy and server identity. It's hard to feel like someone when there's 15k people on the server
---
&gt;majority
---
They only need to wait if they don't want to wait in a queue.
---
And adding sharding is a bad idea both for the community and the game itself. After over a decade of fucking up I do not have any faith in Blizzard to not abuse sharding.
---
Yeah, we were 18/19 and pretty moronic when it came to food.  I lived on fast food and energy drinks until I was probably 23 and then it started to catch up to me and I quit doing that.  
---
To be fair though he didn't finish the drink half the time, it just got half empty by his computer, then all the ice melted and he threw it out.
---
Confirmation bias. "If anyone downvotes this it's only because my point is valid."
---
AhhHaaaaa!! How the tables have turned my friend. I knew you would think that I thought you had been bamboozled and writing said post about you being bamboozled was all part of my what looks like 1 more step than your multi-step plan, plan.
---
My mage was so salty when this thing dropped and the druid in the group had his buddies whisper me threatening to get me /gkick’d if I didn’t pass rolling on it. At that point I was using a blue staff that I had outgrown long ago (Illusionary Rod I think) and really could’ve used the upgrade.
---
And the kicker? A week or two later I saw this same druid in Ironforge wielding a BWL staff. Dude had probably vendored the Headmaster’s Charge already while I was standing there stuck with a 30-something blue staff.
---
Played hörde nonstop, want to try alliance but it just feels wrong
---
From player standpoint it is. But putting in battle groups midstream might be significantly more difficult from a developers standpoint. I dont mind playing with 2-3 other servers, you'll still see the same opponents, build grudges, etc. Its slightly less personal, but long queue times really suck.
---
If they make it so that it activates more consistently than it would be a viable option for leveling and farming.  I'm not sure how it actually worked in Vanilla or how it will work in Classic, but generally this is a talent that the large majority of private server warlocks skip.  For what it is worth.
---
By the time you hit your 30s, you have to start managing your voidwalker.  It will run OOM if you keep Torment on full time.  Warlocks are considered a very "busy" class because of this.  
---
You are managing your pet - target including changing targets, location of pet, torment toggling, using the AE taunt.  
---
You are doing your DPS, which is an above average complexity compared to other classes.  Deciding on how many DoTs to put on which target based on how long they live.  Deciding what other spells to use besides your main dots - wand it, shadowbolt, immolate, searing pain for a low health runner etc..  
---
You are CCing.  Fear, death coil, having your pet switch to a new add and adjusting the taunt functions.
---
The reason I list these out is so that you can see that warlock is one of the busier classes when leveling or farming.  Adding one more thing to pay attention to (like making sure the warlock or the drain soul tick gets the killing blow) is just considered one too many things for many warlocks.  Of course if any damage by you or the pet procs it, then that changes everything.
---
Mhm.

Get them while theyre young. Worked on most of us

Every video game has a graphics slider and they can drastically alter your character's appearance to other people. So we should remove graphical settings in every game.

Sorry, didn't mean to offend you.

*Sorry*.

No shame in having one guy ride past SF and capping it as Korrak and the other guards follow him. It's gonna take a few minutes to cap otherwise.
---
I guess you could run the same naxx for the next 10 years. 
---
Played Horde my entire WoW career. My bro and I are rolling Alliance for a 100% fresh experience. Neither of us got to play vanilla either so we’re stoked. 
---
I would vote: 2 years for each phase, 12 years for the full game.
---
Same here.  I chose tank, as I could only pick one, but I don't have much ambition beyond 5/10 man dungeons.  Planning on running a hybrid Arms/Prot spec to do both at once.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BSczf9AEATAD8ADA
---
So you're spending 3 months leveling, 3 months gearing in DM only to be ready for MC when BWL already opened. Does not sound fun.
---
I'm not seeing Blizzard on the list of participants at Pax. Does anyone have a link showing they will be there? 
---
&gt; You won't be able to find groups and you won't be able to buy or sell profession goods/services.
---
This has never happened to me and I've never heard of it happening to anyone else. I have, however, seen a dramatic decline in the number of Nazis and spammers since right-click-to-report was implemented.
---
I am not interested in playing WoW if chat ends up as a safe space for Nazis like Star Craft 2 general chat.
---
Why are you apologizing?! I'm quite offended by the fact that you're apologizing, because you think you offended me. And that is so offensive. You better apologize.
---
Are the BFA zones worth checking out? I heard they're very pretty

Ah, the historical day when cancer actually saved a person from her suffering. Rumours has it that this gnome was later named "Benign-cancer".
---
Corn literally grows out of the fuckin ground easy $$$
---
Not a bad idea. Not sure why ur being downvoted on it, i guess some ppl get tickled? odd.
---
Why does the gear look lower quality in BFA than vanilla?
---
You got CTS AND AQR?! I don’t wanna call you a loot whore but seeing as how those barely ever drop and are bis, ima call you a loot whore dawg. 
---
Looks pretty solid but id recommend 1 point in shieldblock if thats what its called
---
&gt; The Pandas and the japanese-style
---
It is imperial Chinese style, not Japanese. They are ofc many similarities but nothing there occurred to me as Japanese.
---
Very true. People want things that make their life more convenient, not things that are good for the game in the long run. Understandably it is human nature to desire convenience. But fortunately we have already seen what the path of overabundant convenience leads down to, and we can decide things more wisely this time.
---
It sucked but it was pretty normal back in the day.      
---
 Everyone is crying for sever names and such and I’m just laughing. I’ve played since closed beta and what every hardcore PvPer from all previous MMo’s Said was we’re going to the first alphabetical PvP server. Turned out to be Archimonde.      
---
I just wanted to play with my friends from before WoW
---
Virgin alert
---
If anything it’s backwards.
---
Pets are bound to account.
---
You have 10k gold on server A and 5k gold on server B. You want to move your 5k gold from server B to A.
---
You check AH on both servers and see that a pet sells for 5k on server B and 8k on server A.  You buy pet on server B, learn it, log on server  A , put pet in cage and then sell on AH for 8k. Congratz you now have 18k om server A.
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
Probably due to  anisotropic texture filtering, antialiasing all quality settings maxxed out on the new client.
---
It helps blend stuff but sometimes looks off on older stuff maybe.
---
Sorry, I meant esfand, had a brain fart of mixing their names up, I think due to the order they name themselves in on the podcast
---
Man old wow is even more uglier than I thought 
---
You didn't in D2 either!  You could just hold the click down.
---
You mentioned mage being soft countered by hunters, priests, and shaman, but what about warlocks? I remember when I played mage in vanilla, warlocks were by far the toughest class for me to beat.
---
Good times!  Most of the food I ate back then I won't touch now (we probably had similar diets).  Since getting excited for classic though, I've been listening to all the music I used to listen to back then. Bands like Nine Inch Nails, Tool, A Perfect Circle, Rammstein.  It's not that I dislike those bands now, my tastes have just vastly expanded across genres, so I rarely play them. It's really brought me back to those days, and I'll definitely be listening to them while I play classic.  I might sneak in a few sodas, Red Bull, and Oreos too. :D
---
I’d add to this that part of the reason WSG was a bit more even than AV was that druids play such an important role in flag carrying and NE and Tauren druids were relatively equal. Otherwise I think this is pretty much it.
---
hehehe.  It helped being a decent (and the only) sword rogue in the guild for a while.  At least I think so... it has been a long time since and memories get fuzzy around the edges.
---
I think you misspelled alliance
---
Digging the channel man, past 3 videos have been quite entertaining!
---
Also, yeah, Gnomes are probably within the top 3 reason I always have played Horde.
---
When I clicked the title, I was expecting to hear how 5% int boost is negligible to your PVE damage.  So I got nothing :)
---
Just to let you know, the song is available on Spotify too
---
So, are you saying we should riot in Orgrimmar? Block the Zeppelins?
---
How can Blizzard listen to us? :V
---
I remember in 2005, my perspective was 256mb was bare minimum, 512mb was pretty good, and 1gb was fantastic. I played star wars galaxies on 256mb and it was a trying experience, had to reduce graphics down to polygonal levels. Then I upgraded to 512mb and a new pc entirely when I got WoW and I had zero problems from there
---
and the off warrior cries in the corner as hunters and ret paladins go to town on their rolls / dkp for it because the 'dream of 2 handed warrior raiding' has died more than 15 years ago?  
---
Got one of these for PvE?!
---
Yea ill be rolling alliance this time. Was a decision within the guild im running with some peeps, we voted and most wanted to roll Alliance including a number of long term horde players.
---
Though im playing for the community more than the faction.
---
Looks less like a riot and more like....ehh...  Well, I doubt I could say it here. 
---
Can I add I want the ui/raid frames of Legion as well as an option.
---
I'm just relieved to hear that this will be the last post on this topic
---
I mean not really, it's mostly try hard minmaxers who want to rush to 60 in 1 week and ask for more content. Most people just want to take their time and enjoy leveling and getting their preraid bis. It's not like us adults with full time jobs/studies will get mad at blizzard for not releasing BGs and BWL 2 months after release and quit playing.
---
That damn baldin' cancer killed his love eternal. Good catch. 
---
there won't be a plan for a length here because it isn't like they need to develop new content.  
---
They will release a new phase when the content drought on retail is risking drops in the monthly subs.  
---
That's the entire  point why classic wow gets paid with the retail subscription.
---
4 months. thats 2 years of classic, I think it's ideal.
---
Im gunna eat pizza rolls and drink mountain dew. Because thats all i consumed when i was playing wow the most. 
---
The shieldless DW tanking is very high level shit, for tanks who already have enough gear to survive and generate threat without a shield. At the level of preraid gear, for example, warriors need their shields, and are far more effective for it.
---
It’s also easier to gear a warrior as you can use all the plate gear and weapons.
---
Fear is also pretty fucking common. Even 5 man bosses for endgame dungeons like Cptn Kromcrush in DM have it. If a tank gets feared on a boss, a wipe is super likely. You can invest in a Druid MT but they’ll never have thunderfury.
---
 And druids might generate better  threat than a sword and board warrior, but not the kind of threat a fury dw warrior would. So that dw tanking is used when you need max dps and know you can survive the boss, usually thanks to OP healers. When boss damage is the problem though; then a shield with improved shield block for consistent uncrushability and uncrittability is absolute king. As are the oh-shit cooldowns.
---
All that said, I think druids are good tanks and the stigma isn’t what it once was. They’re not uncommon at 60, some guilds on my server have them, they’re widely acknowledged to be the second best tank at least.
---

/sheds a single tear
---
Three months per phase would be good I think, but they'd have to get the PVP in Phase 2 the latest.
---
Please correct, as 1.2 and 1.12 is obviously a big difference :) 
---
I feel the same way about [Full Throttle Blue Agave](https://www.amazon.com/16-Pack-Throttle-Energy-Drink/dp/B0026WG9LE) that you do about about your SoBe.  Def. going to order some for launch.
---
Okay Dewey!
---
Glancing blows (40% of white hits) go from 70/100 dmg to 85/100 dmg I believe. It’s pretty significant, especially for warrior rage generation
---
Hunters have the highest gold per hour with DM tribute runs.
---
Mages and I think Priests are up there with their ability to AOE DM.
---
Rogues have a nice advantage in mining arcane crystals since they can stealth past all the elites in Silithus to get to the rich thorium veins in the caves.
---
They already made a statement that muting is the maximum action that will be taken via right click reports without human involvement, no? Does everyone still have a problem with it in that light?
---
Asscandy most useless item.
---
And they are actually somewhat useful in very rare situations. The Barov trinket is stronger though, but the whistle can still be useful in places like AB and Huhuran.
---
Bring a mage or something with relevant CC to all your 5 mans. Use marks and plan pulls, even if only for yourself. Thank me later.
---
What I'm getting at, in the video linked above, the guy is saying that it happened in Vanilla, never saw, never heard of it.   And then he goes on to say that people didn't know that flasks were good.  
---
To me it just feels like he's talking strictly about private servers, and not about vanilla at all 
---
Still going to play Classic? :( 
---
I'm sad
---
TOTINO'S PIZZA ROLLS
---
Even better instead of a download code in the box include the game on 4 CDs. The ultimate nostalgia. 
---
Nah u macro it
---
o fuck...o shit... I was just trying to help out too... 
---
The faces are no big deal. The way the new models run however ... They jump around like cartoon characters from disney. Taurens are the worse. Why did they do that is truly mind boggling to me. It's plain ridiculous, and serves no purpose or whatsoever.
---
Priest or Shaman? I’ll be a pretty casual player, but I’ve got a fair share of raiding experience from BC, WOTLK, and Cata. I rolled a pally healer pretty much the whole time and I genuinely like healing, both because it’s fun and because I hated trying to find groups as DPS. So to get my damage dealing kicks I really enjoy BGs. I also really liked tanking but can’t commit to a MT lifestyle, otherwise I’d be a warrior :)
---
I’ll be playing with old buddies from high school when possible, and enjoy talking to my groups and team dynamics etc.
---
I imagine that house being absolutely wretched. Four 18 year old gamers all shacked up in 1 place.
---
&gt;not hoarding your DKP for Ashkandi.
---
Thanks Dude, rly appreciate you saying that. And yeah I just cant get over how incompetent they seem, forget about the fact that theyre 2 feet tall. I didnt even roast them on that lol.
---
i think you hit the nail on the head here. it's not as if vanilla wow's models weren't cartoonish, but the thought process here wasn't ''how would this race run?'' it's ''how overdone can we make these animations to flex our new tech?''
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANGES
---
Boom roasted lmao. Another good one. 
---
Why limit ourselves to 1.x patches when we could all enjoy the awkwardness of BC prepatch which was technically during vanilla. I’m kidding I know that touching talents is off limits. Bassicly every single one of us has their own idea of what we want from classic. Unfortunately the game isn’t going to make every single person happy. It’s got to big of an audience with widely differing opinions. 
---
Man what a difference in graphics. It makes me a little sad. Yeah sure graphics and details are better now but that’s not what’s important. What’s important is that rogue. He’s the main thing in that screen shot.      
---
It’s simply iPhone portrait mode vs a regular photo.         
---
Oh man I see what you mean, I just don't get how everyone says every other hero is bad at pvp. Like i ask about feral druid - bad, enhancement - bad, warrior - bad, pally - boring as hell. So only ranged or casters are good at pvp?
---
Yeah I'll have like one night a week where I'll kick back with pizza or burgers, but I can't hit it everyday like I used to
---
i hate to be all ''vanilla did it better!'' but, i mean.......
---
i think the best example of this is the tauren. even when the new models first came out and i was really excited for them, i thought the face looked wonky. i wasn't the only one, either, as i remember a pretty popular post either here or on the forums with a fan edit to them that looked so much better.
---
also, those fingers are just freaky lol
---
Did Sully ever get his granite murial ?? 
---
Man it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  Since it was only a two bedroom town house we had to share a lot of space so if things got too messy it got aggravating fast.  We did a sort of "spring cleaning" like once a month and got everything pretty spotless.  A few months in we just all started keeping mini trash cans next to our computers and got good at just taking them out every couple days.
---
We made it work for a few years.  I forget exactly how long, but we were still all living there when TBC came out.  We worked at our Blockbuster all the way till the very end.
---
As far as memory serves decimate or decimot or something was the guy who tried to copy aylen's 1000 dps on patchwork with all the world buffs in the world. He ended up on a 12xx \~ ish average (with KT gear while Aylen was a B raid rogue with only iblis and the trash drop dagger as MH and no other naxx gear).  
---
Of those 12xx effective dps 58% were white hits and due to him being a gnome he lost more than 150 dps overall
---
again this was a while back, I'll edit this when I can find the old clips if they still exist on warcraftmovies
---
Yep, thats also how I remember it. Installed only gatherer and an AH addon and that was only in 2006 when I had two lvl 60 chars. 
---
Can't wait to run laps in the Orgrimmar PvP sign up area while I wait for queues!
---
hard agree here. i can tell the difference between most of the old faces at a glance, i can't do that with the new faces. i think polygon-wise most of the bodies are fine and i don't think most people would argue that (unless they just prefer older graphics, which i agree with) but the faces, man...
---
it's not even just those three examples, every race got dealt a hand of sameface, under the excuse that it was easier to rig the facial expressions. yknow, the ones you don't see in the character creation screen, your character portrait, and usually never ingame. 
---
There's something more aesthetically pleasing about vanilla to me. Everything always looks so smooth and soft. The whole world is relaxing to look at.
---
The newer stuff always looks so harsh and overly serious.
---
I don’t know about “should be against the rules” but I do think killing vs corpse camping is a key distinction. 
---
If I pass a high lvl guy on the road in STV and he kills me, that’s his prerogative. I’d rather not die, but as something that can happen I don’t mind it at all. If he values his time he’ll just keep going along the road at that point, satisfied he made me corpserun for 2 mins.
---
If he stays and corpsecamps me repetitively until I have to relog an alt (imo the best response if you’re alone, make them sit there for 10 mins wasting their time while you level, then come back) then he’s being a fucking asshole.
---
Now, there’s a clear difference between these two situations. I still think he should be allowed to do corpsecamp. 
---
Pservers show higher stats on druids and a decent distribution. With decent I mean no class is way under 10%.
---
Also no sane guild, even if they are "hardcore" will try and bring solely warriors/mages/priests. First of all you simply couldn't do all the encounters because you lack unique utility from the other classes. Secondly maybe you'll finish some bosses a bit faster but you'll gear up *way* slower, which makes the whole thing moot. Third, the actual statistical difference in DPS and HPS between the classes isn't as big as people make it out to be. Ranged DPS are lead by mages and Hunters are behind, but we're talking about a few percentage points here. Melee DPS are very close to eachother. Healers have different healing roles so it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to argue about a few percentages there. Does that still mean you want to bring fewer of the underperforming classes and more of the leading ones and leave out meme specs? Yes, but it doesn't mean you leave out a whole set of classes. Nobody does that. 
---
Yeah you just earned a sub from me bro
---
July 16
---
It definitely doesn’t have the ability to visually awe that it had at launch.
---
Yeah well, Warlocks are the toughest class to beat for pretty much everybody, except maybe Paladins or Shamans. I'm not sure why he didn't convey how strong locks and SPriests are, because they're a hard counter to pretty much everything else on equal skill levels.

---
Is this confirmed?
---
&gt; turtle for no practical purpose
---
Turtling has a practical purpose you can force mistakes or turn around a seemingly lost battle. When AV is prolongued by turtling that means it is a tactical choice, influenced by the players who are in the BG. Unlike old AV where it was just incredibly slow by default.
---
Also did you play old AV? It was a pain in the ass grind that was dictated by PvE elements, people were constantly leaving and joining. No thank you, There is already very little PvP content as is.
---
And again, new AV already takes you anything between 30min and 2h approximately and can easily go on longer if one side decides to play defensively. That is a *long* match.
---
Holy crap I loved this back in the day! I played a mage and tried to do that every single battleground. Lol
