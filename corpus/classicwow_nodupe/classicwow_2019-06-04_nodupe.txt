I kinda thought there would be more mounts. I mean, not as many as there are in current retail but more than this.
---
---
---
Right so what was the reason except for belf hate?
---
I don't recall many "pugg" raids. Most of the time MC was still useful well into naxx so they kept running them. Gotta get those legendaries. 
---

---
One high rank guild on my server sold slots for mc. For 500 gold you would be given every item for your class that dropped. They guaranteed at least 2 items.
---
Well it's a good thing a mage has so many spells in their toolkit to ensure they're never in melee range...
---
The number of notification icons in the screenshot are making me twitch
---
LULW
---
Sure 1 milllion dollars
---
So no more wow content trailers from him? Damn :(
---
So TBC class system in vanilla would be good then
---
We had one in my current server for awhile.  He actually did pretty well in MC.
---
No just no
---
Lol
---
Yes. Betas are to find out what doesn't work so it doesn't get fixed before release.
---
Good job.
---
Imagine not connecting to you neighbors WiFi 4 houses down to experience the genuine classic lag. Enjoy your 2019 experience lmao
---
6: You cant cast PW:S on players that aren't in your group.
---
It‚Äôs fucking staggering that you continue to argue as if you‚Äôre some beacon of morality and principle, but you can‚Äôt understand that teleporting a single troll to a different zone, for the sake of making a community event more enjoyable for 100,000+ people, is a reasonable thing to do. 
---
You know what happens when one fuck head decides to streak on the field during a sporting event? They get kicked out because that‚Äôs a bullshit thing to do.
---
A blizzard CEO just got a boner
---
How do you plan to enjoy endgame content when only a few people will be at endgame when I rush it
---
You know what's better than boosting though 60 levels? Instantly gaining 110 levels! You should check out BFA
---
You're kidding ? 
---
They just throw races into wow now? 
---
They really are trying to hook into the fortnite kids
---
What use does detect invisibility really have in vanilla?
---
Well, I would never level as resto nor do I enjoy the constant drinking as elemental but enhancement offers some nice shit like imp. ghost wolf, +5% crit, +15% to str and agi totems, flurry and parry. I personally don't even use windfury because it's just too unreliable and really enjoy the consistency of rockbiter (so this time around, I probably won't take elemental weapons at all).
---
Then it's either dip a bit into resto (the -0.5 off healing wave is sooooo good) or elemental (elemental focus is dope).
---
I suppose it's a bit min-maxy but the fact that you seem so against people not taking it (are you high?) is kinda silly. Like, lemme play how I want, man.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, we gott'em
---
OP doesn't realize it but anger is what oils the gears of vanilla. You don't like the streamer and his army of mongoloids?  Get in trade chat and start one of your own.  It doesn't take a streamer to rally people in classic only a goal, a plan, and a tiny bit of charisma.
---
I never had a problem in vanilla that I couldn't solve by throwing more bodies at it.
---
Shut up and go back to retail you filth
---
Nice shit post have an upvote
---
No please no. This would ruin the game.
---
I predict the majority of players would be in endgame content with you once XP boosts are released.
---
No because you need spell power to increase the damage of your spells. Unlike melee damage, spell damage stays stationary and does not scale with a better weapon or more intellect/spirit or whatever. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The only thing that will increase damage of spells is gear with + spell power. 
---
When everyone is green trash, their stamina is low enough for your burst spells (chain lightning+ shock) to do significant amount of damage. A CL crit without any gear will be around 1,200 damage. And a shock is similar as a crit. If both crit, youll maybe take 90% of health away. Most average stamina at 60 range from 3000-4000, with very good raid gear, they go to 5000-7000.
---
Its more fun playing enhance at lower levels because the devilsaur set usually increases melee crit % and you wanna stack as much crit for enhance as possible
---
I get that, but Blizzard has also said this was about the Vanilla experience and preserving the original game. You can‚Äôt do that if it‚Äôs gone. Even if the Vanila population tanks, I think there will always be enough people around for a several servers. I think some need to be left original. 
---
I say all this as a player who WANTS TBC, but the people that want Vanilla should be allowed to keep it. In my opinion, at least.
---
That female smug face looked great, wish it was still in
---
how does one acquire soul shards? i know they fill up your inventory ü§î
---
Check Ebay in about a week after launch.
---
Yeah that's true. There's not alot of leeway as a hunter against some classes. But you can just brute force alot of specs.
---
Have to disagree with them not doing as well in PvP after MC. Once you get your hands on a crossbow of smiting from Chromagg you can literally two shot clothes
---
Mostly you just shadowbolt down the main target in 5 mans.
---
It's funny my guild was halfway through aq40 when bc dropped, I felt like we were behind the curve but really that had me ahead of probably 90% of the player base so to me enchanting everything back then was just something you did rather than being the minority
---
new races were a main feature of BFA,but not realized several months into BFA lmao
---
&gt;They murdered my boy Lothar and yet **WoW says he was killed in an "honorable duel" with Orgrim Doomhammer.** 
---
Wait WTF? I always thought they stuck with original lore of him getting ambushed brutally, in part due to the betrayal of Alterac!
---
Your going to be disappointed with the end game if you don't want to grind XP.
---
I don‚Äôt really care about this situation one way or the other, and I agree it‚Äôs not fair to judge a situation based off of the little information that‚Äôs actually available, but if you‚Äôve ever had to deal with contractors, especially in times of crisis (after storms, tornadoes etc.) they *CAN* be some of the scummiest people on the planet, and if you‚Äôve been fucked over by one then you‚Äôd kind of understand why people will shit on tips now.
---
This subreddit is extremely overboard with the streamer hate and they are going to eat him alive from now on simply because of this one way or the other because now they have a reason to.
---
I agree with this. Leveling as druids are best when embracing the hybrid aspect (ie. using multiple forms, using balance spells as feral spec, etc). Not even just for min maxing. This is the most fun dynamic play style for druids.
---
"Do why do people want this? Is it just nostalgia?" 
---
I wonder where I've heard this before.
---
Obvious troll
---
Not rumored it is already a fact to be a new playable faction,
---
What the hell are u even talking about? Aff lock is supposedly impossible, yet Boomkins and Enh is possible? Affliction is completely viable. You can even run SM/Ruin and be viable in both PvP and pve raiding. Affliction DPS is nowhere near as bad as others such as Enhance, Feral, ret, ele, Boomkins, and probably most hunters.
---
Grinding XP is different than fighting for the best rewards possible.
---
How much would these co boost cost? $10 for 30% for 2 hours, $15 for 4, $20 for 8 hours
---
Personally, I think it's fine if a group of friends say "we're running this PUG and if the Bindings drop, they're ours, you guys can have everything else".
---
I imagine the exact same way that DKP and LC guilds do? Their slogan is basically "you won't get shit for months and months and even then you're always second fiddle to the original people who have been here forever. 
---
At least with tiered roll, it's "you won't get shit for months and months, but once you're in, you're on the exact same playing field as everyone else. Except tanks."
---
Lonely content creator looking for more friends. I consider them family too. :)
---
He's full of it. Affliction is perfectly fine for Raids. You spam Shadowbolt basically. Debuff limit isn't a killer, you'll still do decent damage
---
Blizz probably disabled it for everyone outside the beta until the next stress test.
---
Loot council has a big drawback that corruption can occur. If you did favors for members on LC, become friends or form clique with LC, happen to be on the LC, etc then favoritism can form and award you items over people who may be more deserving of it. On the opposite spectrum being outspoken or not getting along with one member could potentially have negative impact on loot chances even if youre a top member of the class. It's also harder to prove corruption since is a "he said/she said" accusation unless someone send you a screenshot of the LC stating corrupt reasons. Dkp charts with history you can see and prove any odd changes.
---
They removed it because too many people were asking if they had beta, however I still have it on my launcher so I‚Äôm not sure if that means I have beta or not.
---
Not out at release
---
mostly id like the new character models. I didn't play much in vanilla so I don't have a big attachment to the old graphics. If you do good on you but I wish it was an option. don't really agree with the sentiment of keeping vanilla exactly the same as it was forever
---
You acquire a soul shard by channeling a spell called ‚ÄúSoul drain‚Äù while an enemy dies. 
---
You usually load up an enemy with damage over time abilities and then cast Soul drain when an enemy is at about 20% health. The damage ticks away and kills a monster and a soul shard is obtained.
---
The Arena was the start of E-sports which was the start of class homogenization
---
Nah, it's just a beta and blizzard *obviously* knew it was happening. So if there were any rules broken, the people enforcing the rules don't care.
---
First post that actually made me laugh. good job.
---
Yeah I have a mix of 6/8 T2 with agility offpieces (still finishing gearing) like barb of the sand reaver, cloak of blood god etc.  I'm at like.. 23 or 24% crit so kind of low, but 4500hp unbuffed so it kind of balances out!  Once I finish gearing (never touching Naxx, but just finishig from AQ40 and BWL) I'll be I think about 4800hp and 25% crit, 1300, 1400apish.  Hit cap is easy for PVP (only need 2% I think if you have 3/3 surefooted!) so I can cheat and gear more for damage.
---
His Naxx one was awesome.
---
Don't see your mod comment on the post where he suggested suicide. Cool double standard, modboy.
---
Need more rage!
---
Bindings are the one acceptable piece.  I'm talking people reserving regular raid drops, or them being the only mage/rogue etc. in the raid.  That shit was far too common in Vanilla, and those raids usually failed to get very far.
---
and you always get one? or is it like a chance rng thing
---
Didn‚Äôt they change it to the BFA client? Which, in theory, would up the specs.
---
"why is that hunter wielding a Warden's Staff?"
---
I think two handing is going to be better at low gear levels and roughly even with DW at higher gear levels where you start to see weapons more designed for tanking. For example Maladath or Blackguard. Something like parry is hard to come by for hunters, but if I get a great two hander I won't complain. Even Lok'Delar has a big chunk of stam.
---
If vanilla private servers ever become big again then they can strike down on them without any of the grayzone around the topic that existed before. They also get to adopt that entire user base. The subs not being defined between classic and bfa also makes it easy to pretend both of them are having growth, which shareholders will appreciate.
---
they can tank. Just not most raid encounters. While druids can generate more threat they are more susceptible to crushing blows. it doesnt mean its impossible but much more likely to get insta gibbed. 
---
Also they only have a single spell for mitigation which is barkskin.
---
to know for sure a druid will have to get as much armor as possible to cap out at 75% armor mitigation and get as much dodge as possible. only then will we know for sure.
---
because I'm uncertain and curious I'm going to be leveling a druid as a second character and I'm going to try it for myself. I mained druid from tbc and onwards.
---
Yeah if I was actually 'gud' I would write something up I've never written a guide before but teh complete lack of vanilla hunter PVP guide is sad!  But I've only started to PVP for maybe 15-20 hours or so for this guy.. I'm still learning so much no way I should write a guide.
---
Ah I see, seems awkward.
---
OH SHIT I MADE A VIDEO POST HERE WOOHOOOO
---
Not quite what I was saying. guess you really have an issue with it.
---
oh k, didnt play much this year :D
---
This sounds awesome! I'd definitely join
---
That's why all these 5head big brain strats Pserver players have come up with weren't around during vanilla, it's not that people hadn't thought of them, it's that they simply weren't viable.
---
stress testing is over for now.
---
Honestly it seems like this thread is a bunch of people regurgitating shit they have no idea about, specifically locks. Afflictions main DPS comes from Shadowbolt in pve. Sure, it sucks to not be able to dot up the boss, but you do perfectly fine with Shadowbolt. Compared to an Enhancement shaman and a Boomkin, you'll definitely have an easier time on an Affliction Lock no question about it.
---
Nope, always. It is a guaranteed creation as long as Soul Drain is being channeled.
---
&gt;Yep because if you dont agree that " All human interaction is based on greed and is therefore corrupt" means you arent smart.
---
Yeah I don't think you'll find anyone highly educated disagreeing with this, it's just basic psychology.
---
&gt;So if someone donates to someone or helps them out, they are some how still acting out of greed. God what a bleak world view.¬®
---
Pretty much everyone donates things for self-serving reasons, yes. This isn't exactly controversial. Some do it for future favors, others do it for social gain, or because they want to view themselves as good people.
---
&gt;Players that are more interested in being able to get exactly the gear they want than clearing content can join another guild that gives them that. 
---
You're not going to find 40 people like that unless they're getting paid for it, so it's a purely theoretical situation that doesn't exist. 
---
Individual goals will never align with collective goals, because people created collectives to realize their individual goals. The only reason we have society for example, is to not die.
---
Every time I've submitted a ticket on retail they've still put in RP and it felt very personal and that a lot of effort went in, even though I don't play on an RP server. I'd say the ticket/support of WoW is the best I've ever seen in any game, even today. They've nearly always gone out of the way to help me. So yeah they still do it.
---
Last time was because I was deleting a lot of alts I never used, and I accidentally deleted one of my max levels that was holding all of my gold. The character restore function was still on cooldown because I had used it a few days earlier, so I couldn't restore it. I submitted a ticket and the GM bypassed the cooldown for me and got it back very quickly, as he could see me accidentally delete it in the logs. WoW support is just great, always feels like you're talking to a person who really is passionate for the game and understands your issue personally.
---
Undead master race
---
Well that really depends on the mmo sandbox and honestly is how the genre has developed.
---
Initially mmo‚Äôs offered just as many ways to combat toxicity as they did ways to be toxic. Now the only way they offer to combat toxicity is a report to the game overlords. Which is sad, very sad.
---
Silent bid is a risk vs reward system. Sure you can be a warrior and try to bid 1dkp for that weapon because you're being cheap, but then you risk someone out budding you.
---
It's also harder to bid people up. If I see highest dkp person and an item drops they likely want I could bid a ton of dkp to see if it will drop their, but then they might bid a lot less than I thought and now you zero out your own dkp.
---
Colluding is really hard with silent bid, because you'd have to ask everyone in the raid who could use the item if they were ok with you getting the item for 1dkp and then if some order was set up they'd get it for 1 as well. Which also assumes everyone goes along with system and you don't have someone who doesn't go along and wins stuff.
---
Try and build a set of  
---
   
---
* high stam
---
* high armour
---
* high crit
---
* high spell damage
---
* +4% hit 
---
  
---
Mail gear with from only MC/BWL.
---
Every time as long as the enemy is at least green to you so about 6 or so levels lower than you
---
&gt;Cross Faction communication? Against ToS
---
the devs have changed their stance on this. they said cross faction collusion is A-OK for classic.(wish it wasnt the case though)
---
Whoa that‚Äôs way too much automation. You don‚Äôt even have to target an enemy to CC?
---
Definitely so yes. Fair warning tho: shit will give you the creeps. It does not hold back on the horrors of radiation or how nearly the world ended.

strafe
---
When classic was vanilla people weren't complaining about toxicity in every single online game.
---
As the primary off tank in a progression raiding guild my repair bills and consumable costs made sure "too much gold" was never a problem. I didn't get my epic mount until the 0.5 quests came out and I was able to sell off my stockpiled arcanite bars.
---
Excellent, thanks!
---
This is an amazing idea, someone please propose it to blizz
---
The models, meshes textures and particle effects are the same, but the rendering method has changed from a forward renderer to a deferred one.
---
Deferred isn't inherently more taxing, actually less so in many ways by decoupling shading from geometric complexity, but it does require some modern GPU features to be performant, like the ability for a single shader program to output to multiple buffers simultaneously.
---
not sure what u were trying to say then.
---
what i'm saying is that unless you go out of your way to group up with people it's unlikely you'll ever see them again.  whereas in vanilla, if you add somebody as a friend and walk past them u go oh look there's my friend hey u wanna group up again since we're both here already?
---
Ya Ive seen too many hunter videos where they just shit on clothies to not think theythey are bad later in PVP..hunters always have beeb kings of BGs when played decent. ive not set my goals super higher, I jsut wanna fuction at slightly above avg..if I get better, thats a bonus. But im reserving a priest and mage too anyways, I will be able to figure out from there, maybe not gear every class but at least figure out what I want, its hunter is too much for me
---
Yeah same here
---
You on a F&amp;F list?
---
I remember getting my mind blown by the godly 1600x1200 resolution of a friend's monitor.
---
Lol thanks :)
---
&gt; So what do I need to know exactly before going in?
---
That in PVE there's absolutely no reason a rogue should be using maces, regardless of race.
---
The carapace was my first ever epic! My buddy was stoked when it dropped and I had no idea why. It didn't have any stats...luckily he explained why I should roll need on it.
---
Not too many people getting the reference. I appreciate it !
---
after having mained a mage since forever... I think you just gave me my classic name. Mageslave.
---
No, they've indeed retconed it for some reason. Probably wanted more Fights of Heroes, or wanted Horde to not look such dicks.
---
Could you give some sources on those 54? They all seem conflicted, but yours is the lowest ive seen, and i cannot find its source anywhere.
---
Actually travelling, as opposed to joining LFG, to a destination IS rewarding.  Showing up late to raids ISN'T rewarding, so the sarcasm didn't land.
---
why gank a lvl 1 though?
---
Warcraft 2 was the first computer game I ever played, followed by WC2 Tides of Darkness (yes, this was even before the BNet edition) and followed by eventually playing Warcraft Orcs and Humans, and then finally spending YEARS enjoying WC3. 
---
First of all, you absolutely should be hyped for WC3. It's an incredibly rewarding experience that gets more fun as it goes along. Although WC3 Rain of Chaos has amazing story, the gameplay of it is a bit repetitive. WC3 TFT on the other hand keeps going with the amazing story, and then ups the ante with fantastic gameplay, especially the Blood Elf and Undead campaigns. You'll have an absolute blast.
---
Warcraft 2 has okay storyline, but a lot of things get dropped. The gameplay is even more repetitive. Also, although the Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness campaigns are pretty reasonable, the Beyond the Dark Portal campaigns are INSANELY difficult. Still, I would say that if you enjoy the lore of the Eastern Kingdoms (especially Lordaeron), there's a good chunk of that in there.
---
Warcraft 1 has easy gameplay honestly, (if EXTREMELY tedious do the low unit selection limit and needing to build roads) but the lore is almost completely irrelevant to anything going on in WoW. Still, if you feel like just getting as deep into the hype as possible, the ease of the campaigns mean it can be a decent way to pass time.
---
Ultimately since you have WC3, I'd mostly stick with that since it's absolutely fantastic and still holds up, if you want to get deeper into the lore then WC2 is good too. WC1 is where it all began, but doesn't offer much in today's day and age unless you want to just get as much Warcraft as you can :).
---
I wouldn't mind any UI additions that will also be available via addons anyway.
---
Well they won‚Äôt be able to make a level 1 if they have a toon on the other faction already.
---
I was saying you can still add friends and then just group up if you want to play with them. Unless you have some aversion to talking to people when you log in to see what they‚Äôre up to. There is literally no reason not to add people. Probably not every person you see.
---
Also if it works like crz/sharding in retail. Friends and guildies are matched on layers most of the time automatically.
---
Everyone freaking out about people wanting to get a beta key is one of the most annoying things on this sub
---
Yeah, so the info's probably true about it being F&amp;F only in this wave.
---
A relentless fucking experience !

The after party
---
Your drawing is very good btw
---
It reminds me of Berserk, and if someone told me this was from a panel in that manga I'd believe them.
---
Ganked a level 21 (I was lvl 28) in Ashenvale then I get this message a few moments later. Dude made a horde just to bitch me out. I ignored him, and then a few mins later a level 60 alliance rogue camped Splintertree post for about 30 mins.  
---
Apparently he was having a hard day.
---
You still have to manually run/fly to any mythic level instance in BFA and in 15 years that's never been rewarding. Thats why warlocks are summon duty and why meeting stones exist.
---
If you are ganking lowbies just live with the fact some people are going to call you a loser. Because you are. Also I'm logging onto my 60.
---
If you raid MC/BWL/Ony/AQ20/ZG you can get a good set together. 
---
Helm - Ony (T2)/T 0.5
---
Neck - Random MC Boss drop one or Choker of the Fire Lord (Hard to get this as shammy though) -- Ogre Bead neck piece is good from tier 0.5 quest line 
---
Shoulders - The +40 Nature damage ones from MC
---
Back - Ony/ZG/AQ20 Class Back
---
Chest - ZG tier Chest
---
Bracers - ZG tier piece/T 0.5 
---
Hands - Earth Fury (T1)
---
Belt - ZG Tier Piece/ T 0.5 
---
Pants - T2 pants off rag
---
Boots - T2/T 0.5
---
Rings - A lot of choices
---
Trinkets - Briarwood/UBRS quest 2% crit/ZG/ZG Class trinket very good against warriors/rogues
---
Weapon - AQ20 Exalted Mace/Aurastone/Chrommy Hand/Nef Hand
---
Shield - UBRS summoned boss in beast room shield, rag shield, vael shield 
---
Definitley possible to put together a decent ele shaman set without aq40/Naxx. Can probably mix in some of the blue pvp set as well.
---
Never did PUG in Vanilla or TBC. I don't remember them being a thing. A dedicated guild which weren't hardcore but did raid weekly sometimes had a difficult time completing MC in one night (4-6 hours). There was always afkers, dc, people who just had to go to sleep etc.
---
This falls under client modification. On vanilla, tbc, and wrath, in order to do this you have to change the DBC files. Whether you change the default database or make copies that get read after the old ones, you have to copy and modify those database files and re-archive them (.MPQ files). You have to modify game files for the game to use your different models. This also applies to mods that add additional zone music.
---
This is and always has been against the ToS, but Blizz has traditionally looked the other way unless there's reason to suspect a player is using it to cheat. For instance turning the WSG flag into Onyxia so it clips through walls and it's ridiculously easy to locate even though FC is hiding.
---
Blizzard recently did a ban wave for this kind of thing, though they reversed it since the majority of people doing it were only doing it for cosmetic reasons, the same way you and I were doing this on 1.12 pservers.
---
The fact is, it's against the ToS and has always had the potential to get you banned. Warden never picked it up, but newer security systems obviously do and Blizzard is not obligated to differentiate between changing night elves to high elves vs changing some small, hard to find thing to something big and easier to see. Blizz has demonstrated that it does in fact know now if you are using tmorph or other model editing tricks and it isn't worth risking your account if they change their unofficial policy later down the road and stop overlooking harmless edits.
---
I‚Äôve done the 1-60 content a million times in vanilla up to BRD, but I‚Äôve never done the 60 dungeons or raids. So you‚Äôre definitely not alone! 
---
Plus I just got my fianc√© into the game, and she‚Äôs never played an MMO at all.
---
all I know is r/wow has 1 million subs this one has 127k and yet active online they are about the same.
---
Dude, it happens the lvl 60 camp will be super real until dishonorable kills becomes a thing.
---
This isn't a thing. Can't create cross-faction characters.
---
EPGP is a separate dkp system, so I don't think that would be it for silent bid.
---
EPGP was Earned Points Gear Points. Basically you earn dkp like other dkp systems. However, items usually have a set cost. The person with the highest dkp would have priority and win the item. The cost of the item would be added to their gear points. You would then divide dkp by gp and it would give you a number which would be your priority score.
---
Example 100 dkp 20 gp would have pirorty point of 5. Someone with 100dkp 60 gp would have priority of 1.66. So who ever has highest priority score would win the item for the GP cost. This system was also more favored among newer members because someone who was new with less dkp could still win against  a long time member because they would have no to low GP. So if the person had 20 dkp and won nothing before they would have high priority until they won that first item and now their ratio is really low.
---
yeah, the meme is kinda niche. but every decent memer can appreciate the shitty craftsmanship :3

They don't attack fast enough in vanilla, you end up going 1 for 1.

You are almost out of Mana, health is low, but you get them down to 10% health, pyroblast proc is up! You the damage meters of tomorrow's raid are already going up, you can taste victory spell reflect lay on hands innervate Superman fly away.

Personally I love hate messages. Peoples tears fuel me. Getting that worked up over a game says far more about you than the guy you think was a jerk/toxic/troll/scumbag.

Agreed, was part of loot council and nipped corruption in the butt few times, just need to keep track of attendance and gear progression along with consumables being used. Easy to spot the people just there for easy loot wouldn‚Äôt even bother getting their pre-bis .

There's zero reason to be mace spec for PVE/Raids. Why would you hinder yourself like that?
---
Its good for older players with slower reaction times, which is the main audience for WoW Classic.
---
Do you think the person that told you to kill yourself actually wanted you to? Or was that perhaps another instance of sarcasm?
---
I led world boss pugs.  I took anyone from active alliance raiding guilds. Had a shit list for bad players. Took nature gear for my guild as we were usually 50% of the raid. Non resist gear was rolled off.
---
I dont expect there to be another wave, and if there is it won't be a big one, I think they got what they need for testing.
---
Looking forward to the next stress test I guess!

Mouse over functionality has been in the game since vanilla. The game is pretty varied in skill levels, so I dont doubt that youve never even heard of it. I didnt know people held their hand on their mouse constantly for turning till burning crusade.

This is a pretty cool idea, especially using time zones and times when people will be free.

If you do one for me, I'll bring in a lot of business to you. I mean like literally a lot. I've got connections.

Seems to me defense and weapon skills take longer to level on em. At least from my recollection and my time on stress test compared to my time on pservers.
---
How do you get vanilla wow? And how good of a computer do you need? I used to play on my friends account when we were kids and I'd love to check it out if possible. Sorry if these are basic questions as well.
---
Don‚Äôt worry - I‚Äôve played wow on and off for years and I‚Äôm still a noob
---
I don't think they'll make any more changes to the content of the phases this late into the development cycle. We're on the bugtesting stage, not the content release philosophy stage.
---
Honestly if the guy came clean and admitted his faults, actually acting like a decent human being - then i would commend him for these efforts. Being morally bankrupt as he is tho, no - it should not matter how many events he puts on to increase his e-peen, we need to condemn him.

Tips did this fraud? Am i understanding that right? Would explain why he seems to N-E-E-D to succeed, at any and all cost, damned be integrity, morales or honesty. Sad to say he seems to have done it tho, as even this prob won't break the wheel - fanbois to the rescue! Being a literal criminal is prob fine.

---
&gt;Nobody is going to know how many raw materials are being hoarded away. What happens when they completely flood the market and selling Essence of Life pre-patch to the speculators actually made more money than post-patch?
---
Actually! Many people (myself included!) do have a pretty good idea because we've played pserver economies, that include similar patch progression, for a few server life cycles. That exact scenario plays out for some very specific items, with predictable swings, after an economy is established.
---
Like I said friends lists and guilds generally get lumped together (at least on retail their system does quite well with it). Also if they are on your friends list and it‚Äôs working properly, you see what zone they are in. So why would you message someone in a dungeon/by asking to group?
---
That's how stuff should be settled. Did something that may warrant a ban? Trial by combat.
---
That's a completely different scenario and you know it. I'm done arguing with you. Good day.

While I'm not a fan of religion I understand what people mean when they bring up "Before Christ" and am aware enough of my bias to discern that they aren't pushing their religion on people.
---
That being said BC/AD isn't that common anymore even in religious dominated areas of the world.
---
It's BCE(Before Common Era) and CE(Common Era) now. The (supposed) birth of Christ is still the pivotal point in history where the eras changed.

I mean, isn't that taking away from the community though?

Too low effort m8

Read his comment history, think it‚Äôs both. Maybe some mental instability too.

Mainly so that you keep moving to next objectives like mob tagging, grinding while you run back etc... But also muscle memory, like hamstring kiting.
---
The ability to maximize your pulls with rage pooling and reducing the time out of combat, is how you can tell if the warrior is going to struggle hard during lvling.

---
Saving these links
---
I still have it but do not have beta access. I was in both stress tests
---
It's a bit more complicated than that.
---
Before you're level 60, your defense skill does determine the chance of crushing blows. It's just that anything beyond 300 defense (or whatever your level cap is) doesn't reduce the chance of crushing blows.
---
But that's not true either.
---
While at 60, it's true a boss has a 15% chance to crush you, but if your combined miss, dodge, parry, and block are high enough to push the chance of crushing blows off the attack table, then you essentially reduce the chance of them happening. This is pretty much why Warriors make superior tanks, because they can do this and Druids and Paladins can't.
---
The simple formuala is (X-Y)*2 - 15 = percent chance to be crushed, where X is the enemy's weapon skill (for mobs and bosses this is LEVEL*5) and Y is your defense skill level cap (or whatever your defense skill is if it's lower than your level cap).
---
So if you're level 45 and a mob is level 50 and you're missing 5 defense skill from your level cap, that's a 45% chance to crush. That 5 defense skill difference is a 10% chance to crush.
---
WoW is about the journey man. Now that you're older I'm sure you won't have a hard time figuring things out and even if you can't then there will be plenty of websites and also people in the game to help you. I'm not sure what you mean about guilds, there will be plenty of guilds forming both when the game launches also for years to come. If you committed and not an rude person then you'll have an easy time finding a helpful guild. Also there are definitely both written guides and video guides to show you have to get the most out of a particular class, just type in "vanilla wow hunter guide" into google or youtube.
---
but you mentioned back in the day. Wow launched with something like 94 servers.
---
Think 8 will do okay?
---
Real talk that is the only reason why I run Gnomer. Every character I own that can use staves has it.

So just getting kited then.

I was 15th on my buddies F&amp;F list and got in a few weeks ago? Not sure how accurate blizz is doing the list then. Does that mean this buddy had higher priority? e
---
Is mace only for PVP then?
---
Almost every boss in the entire game from level 1 to level 60 and definitely in raids is immune to stuns.
---
Play whatever you want and have fun. That should be your primary focus. Don't worry about min/maxing and those racing to 60. Don't worry about getting stuck on an quest, there will always be others and you cannot hope to do all of them. 
---
As to gear just equip things that are better than what you are wearing. You don't necessarily need to worry about best in slot things until you get to the upper levels (55-60).
---
For a guild, join any group you want. If you don't care for them leave and join another. There will be plenty of guilds looking for players and I can guarantee there will be people in every guild willing to help you out. If they won't move on to the next one. 
---
But to reiterated, especially if you haven't really played vanilla wow before is to have fun. Of after all that you still have questions PM me and you can join up with me and my friends from back in vanilla and play with us. Got one guy who is a super wow nerd and can help you out big time.
---
its random on beta thats y people relog to hop for node spawns
---
y not msg them and try check if they want to join if ur going to be asking people like that anyway.  just cause ur both in stv doesn't mean u could be doing anything remotely similar, maybe the guy in wsg does want to group afterall.  either way it's a completely different experience to the natural grouping of vanilla.
---
I would like to add a lil more context, a big message popping up in the middle of your screen saying "Trinket Ready" or "Nova available" is cheap AF
---
Only 60? But well, yes that's another problem. Anyway, I don't think there's an easy solution to it (as blizzard would have implemented it over the years).
---
I'm just going to miss my solo achievements, I had a lot of fun getting the more obscure ones, as well as just the simple joy of getting the fishing ones when I was still playing.
---
Queue a video where it has you fighting something with a voiceover of Goku charging up when you shout, then a rubber duck squeak or just flat out whiff sounds when you miss.
---
People made same threads in 2004. Get over it.

Can't stun raid bosses and many raid mobs.
---
Ooooor how about people just play the game however they want?
---
Yes but even for PVP it sucks...
---
LOL

Real pros found nothing to do in BFA and farmed enough gold to buy 2 years of game time tho.

Not religious in the slightest here but open a history book man. There's a reason that date is so significant around the world. Whether or not Jesus existed or was the Son of "God" his birth/life/death or at the very least the story of it changed our entire Civilization.
---
Fuck a certain character that I won't name since it's a spoiler and this is an unrelated sub!
---
I predict about 20% of lvl 60's to be warriors.  
---
The idea that people will level their warriors to 30 or something and then abandon them for another class I feel is unlikely.  Either they quit altogether or they take the warrior to 60, and I feel like a bigger % of people intending to take their char to 60 rather than just being a tourist will pick warrior.  
---
I remember on the later servers I rolled on in vanilla (ones that opened up in 1.11) warriors were extremely common because everyone knew how powerful they were and how they scaled with endgame gear.
---
You're joking
---
I definitely would have heard about this
---
So to answer yes you want your defense capped for your level. Warriors can (I believe) become uncrushable via shield block. I‚Äôd have to look up some info to get the exact numbers and math behind it. I‚Äôm at work now though.
---
1. About questing: the great thing about this 15 year old game is that everything (or just about) has already been solved. If you get stuck on questing or can't figure something out, check out wowhead.com for all the information you could want. RIP thottbot.
---
2. You will definitely find a guild just playing the game and interacting organically with other players. Guilds also often recruit in major cities. I think this will be easier to do than you think, especially if you meet another player that you enjoy playing with that is already in a guild.
---
3. If min/maxing really is your jam, again, there are tons of resources out there that have already done the legwork and simulation. This includes gear, spec, professions, enchants, world buffs, etc. Noxxic and Icy veins are two current popular websites for this kind of info and I'm sure they will both have sections for the same information in classic. But if not, some other guild or website will pop up in their place. Leveling up your toon also gives you an idea of what works and what doesn't, although this is just becoming familiar with spells and not necessarily a set rotation.
---
I still remember when i contacted a gm back in classic on my druid, dont know why any more, and as a goodbye he said, "may you not stumble over your own roots" and i loved it so much. Its such a small thing but it made so happy.
---
true jungle cleave wasnt even really a thing back then.
---
I briefly played WoW 10 years ago. I've decided that I never really got to experience WoW raiding, I'm going to take the plunge on Classic. Super stoked.
---
Warriors will always be in demand. If you play a tank especially so. If you want to play fury you'll probably be tasked with off tanking. The off tanks in our guild in vanilla we're the guys who played fury warriors for PvP.
---
thats how i role

Oh damn. What debuffs do work on them then?
---
I need to stop seeing undead art. I keep convincing myself on the race of my warlock (orc, as I actually do like orcs), but then I see this stuff or Tirisfal art. Love that undead theme.
---
I agree that aoe only has one chance per cast and not one chance per mob hit. It may come down to private servers getting it wrong, again, but I am positive the T3 passive can proc of each of the arcane missles, not just the first one
---
yeah i agree, but sourcing outside programs to make you betters seems soooo cheap
---
What's better for raiding and levelling then?
---
Sounds good tbh, addon only group‚Äôs people that are using the addon, and its a good way to keep newer players coming to classic in one bunch. I‚Äôm sure people will stop using it once they‚Äôre more experienced with the community
---
I can't link it here because AutoMod removes it, but there's a well-known website with the words Vanilla and Radar compiling data from the most popular pservers, and among other things, it provides Horde- and Alliance-specific class distributions at all level ranges, including 60-only distributions. Go check it if you want the exact numbers, but here's the short answer: The only max level class more popular than Warrior is Mage. And they were *unimaginably* in high demand. Warrior is the best class in Vanilla across pretty much all aspects of gameplay except leveling speed.
---
Man, I wish there was a book of comments or examples in the history of the internet that everyone has to go through at least once before being allowed to even use the web.
---
This one would be in there for sure. This comment is so important for so many people to see and understand.
---
No one here was red to anyone though, it's a horde controlled zone, so horde would be untargetable blue to anyone alliance, and alliance would be neutral yellow to horde :)
---
NO CHANGES. they were available then and should be now
---
So what's viable?
---
mate can't we all play on an even field rather than ye who has the best addons is superior ?
---
To your first question. Yes. Just keep killing mobs. Ask in general if there is another ozone your level.
---
If you want a smooth leveling experience, as a rule of thumb do not do Orange and Red quests. Stick to green and yellow ones. Reason being: they are easier, you can do them faster with less effort and less durability damage; the green quests give xp now, but not later, the orange ones give xp now and later. 
---
It‚Äôs not a big deal if you end up grinding a bit upon your first toon, most people do. But know that if you know where the quests are and do the. In the right order, you never have to straight grind. 
---
More than 1/2 of the guilds ‚Äúforming‚Äù now will be defunct a month into the game. Just meet people in game. You‚Äôve got 200-250 hours to figure out what you want out of the end game and to meet people along the way.
---
None of this matters yet. If you wear cloth, keep your eye out for int/spr stam/int and spell damage/school damage. If you wear anything else, str/stam, stam/agi, agi/str. Generally the weapon in your main hand (or 2h) the biggest stat is the top end damage. Dps of a weapon is largely irrelevant, as that‚Äôs largely normalized to the ilvl of the piece, and speed/top end are adjusted to make that number true. 
---
Druids in form just use the stats on a wep, not the top end or speed. 
---
Everything else you can learn at max level. 
---
Try to have 100g by level 40. Many people can‚Äôt get the gold together till 42-45 (gold reward from quests goes up around 40). 
---
At level 58 you can start your raid attunements. 
---
At max level, PvP, raid attunements, dungeon crawling, farming gold for epic mount, and working on professions are the main ways to spend time in game outside of socializing. 
---
If you read nothing else, have fun, no mistake is permanent, learning is the best part of the game.
---
It will be much more demanding than it was in vanilla wow. It is based on the BFA engine. Private servers were much more demanding too. 
---
I played vanilla wow on a pentium 3 with 256mb of ram. You ain't running classic on that.
---

Where was it ever stated that it was a Bug? I don't believe there was ever an official note in the patches or comment from a blue on the matter.

Stop an addon? You could just not use it. It isn't hurting you or anyone else
---
for one i would like a guild bank, just saying
---
Stupid people also shouldn't be allowed to exist but here you are.
---
The new meta will be different than Vanilla's meta because of pserver innovation. Fury Warriors are the best DPS spec in the 1.12 version of the game by a *wide* margin after they get a bit of gear, and any serious guild will have an abundance of both Prot *and* Fury (and maybe even an Arms or two on Horde because of Windfury). Fury specs won't need to offtank is what I'm saying; they'll be focusing entirely on damage.
---
Not this one, but later in the quest line there is a gnome called Tyrion.
---
Never be afraid to ask a genuine question! It‚Äôs a social game, the game lives or dies by it community. 
---
To answer your question about getting stuck while questing, we have a lot of resources now to help. You can always check out wowhead.com for help with any quest you might be lost on. Most guild will always have guidance or feedback if you want to know a good zone for your level too it be willing to come help complete a quest. 
---
For finding a guild, being social such as doing group quests or dungeons can help with that a lot of times. You make friends with someone, they have a guild and so they‚Äôll probably invite you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to find a guild that works for you or does the content you like. 
---
Finally don‚Äôt worry too much about min/maxing when you‚Äôre new to the game. Do a bit of research and find out what you want to play, get your main stats down and work on that. There will be plenty of time to min/max in the end game. You might miss out on some silly or fun items if you‚Äôre worried about always having the best item for your level. Now if min/maxing is something that makes the game more enjoyable,l for you, check out wowhead or even on this subreddit. You‚Äôll find guides getting posted here all the time.
---
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt /spit or bm them in any sort of way. If they‚Äôre feeling petty enough that might agitate them to specifically corpse camp your ass until you log out. 
---
No, I change my mind. /spit and tbag them relentlessly cuz fuck em it‚Äôs worth it
---
In the stress test it was a setting.
---
Yes. Considering there isn't anyone at Blizz or any patch note that states it was "corrected". 
---
The only logical explanation is that it was flipped by mistake.
---
I played Mace Rogue through Twin Emps and a wing or so of Naxx.  Which is a meme spec by any definition, even with Misplaced Servo Arm and Anubisath Warhammer.
---
Well you are competing against mages/wlocks in general for pvp spots, so that's a big no. PvE there is zero reason to run any spriests and no one will.
---
The Warcraft Chronicles books. Specifically volume 3 for this info. They're amazing books and worth every penny. Available with Prime on Amazon.
---
They got rez(Looking at Druids with their 30 min brez), bubbles, fear, if dwarf a stun/fear ward. Plus ontop of that, I did mention I like cloth as well as staves. Druids was another healer but I dislike their healing style in Classic.  
---
Paladins are nice, I enjoyed playing one.
---
I always knew it to stand for Bathroom In/Out (BIO). Meaning you were going to be back soon and not take a half hour dump
---
It‚Äôs not all ironed out yet. Their goal is to have work close to their retail system. Currently on beta and stress tests each layer is like its own world. You can‚Äôt see the zone your friends and guildies are in if they aren‚Äôt on you‚Äôre layer. Guilds were even having different guild chats based on layers.
---
It‚Äôs a brand new system in a way. Hopefully it will be ironed out and as smooth as retail come launch. I had more layer switches at random on the stress test then I had in all my time playing BfA. I reported each one too cause they stated how it was supposed to work and it wasn‚Äôt working that way.
---
That guy didn't get banned. So why would anyone else when it releases? Half of vanilla was trolling people. If there's butthurt after this, I can't wait to see world bosses kited to cities that heal with every death. I can't wait for August
---
^
---
If you enjoy the leveling experience from 1-10 as a druid, you are good to go.
---
Fak you nochanges kunt. I‚Äôm glad they decided to add dual specs at 40 instead of listening to you whiny faks
---
Thanks a lot, mate. Yeah I was getting hyped for my druid so I started drawing the dungeon tier armor. I practiced a lot when I was younger. I actually found male trolls to be a lot worse. The tauren legs are fun, but you just kinda gotta trust that the hump will work itself out.
---
Oh were they not? Which class then? Paladin?
---
Don't they get some shadow damage debuff? Raids often bring one
---
Why? All this does is parse chat for LFM/LFG messages and auto send an ‚Äúinvite me‚Äù message to the group leader that initiated the chat.  It doesn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt automatically group you and warp you to the instance. Still requires manual communication, adding to group, and travel.
---
You didn‚Äôt think this was going to be a thing?
---
Mages were in high demand or warriors?
---
I have leveled 5 warriors and there is nothing hard about it if you know how to play.
---
same could be said for : "just don't use lfg"
---
If everyone starts using it it's the same.
---
It's called shadow weaving and it's better to just have one healer spec it than bring useless spriest.
---
I don't care for them either which is unfortunate because I was expecting them to announce a makeover of it at the last Blizzcon and then I was really dissapointed when I saw how it looks. I wish it would have just gotten the treatment Starcraft Remastered got. Blizzard has been doing a really sub-par job to put it nicely of the last few WC3 balance patches leading up to the announcement and afterwards too &lt;,&lt;
---
Were the gems socketed on armour on your character? I had most of this gear in the bank because I started leveling in lich king before I left

---
If we're talking hardcore PvP, shadow priests don't usually get placed no. They could replace a Warlock, but it's technically worse. 
---
The issue is that a Shadow Priest doesn't bring any additional utility over a Discipline Priest (which **do** get picked a lot), while their damage can also largely be cleansed (especially if fighting Alliance). Warlocks suffers from the last part too, but brings more CC and utility outside of it not to mention they can spec for far more burst later on. 
---
Regarding solo PvP, Shadow Priests are excellent and some of the best 1v1 classes in the game. Troll or Undead are great (*I personally think Troll is super undervalued and actually very strong due to Shadowguard and Hex of Weakness, the former being able to trigger all shadow priest talents while the latter has a mini Mortal Strike healing received debuff -- and Devouring Plague is a massive mana spender that can easily be cleansed by 4?/9 classes and anyone with a Jungle Remedy but that aside*). 
---
Leveling wise they're quite smooth, a lot of wand usage means they have very little downtime. 
---
Ultimately, if you're **only** interested in the Shadow part of the Priest I'd stay away from them. They're a great class, but a very niche spec. There's not much point to getting one over a Disc Priest which is generally far better for premades, it's tough to be the singular Shadow Priest in a raid and WPVP wise they're amazing but so would Warlocks be which share a lot of the same concepts. If you're interested in the class as a whole, including the healing potential, they're a great pick.
---
This piece is just insane, you‚Äôre truly gifted, congratulations!
---
No one said it was hard,.
---
No idea. The guy was a monster healer. I was watching his blizzcon matches and goddamn, he kept healing his whole team while having zero mana, I don't know what sorcery was this.
---
I  know that dude, i just feel these crazy addons take away so much from the game its crazy.
---
not everyone is in a raid guild, "pug raid" means its just a group of randoms
---
I have leveled 5 warriors in private servers and it really isn't hard at all if you know how to do it. Keep your gear up to par and don't fight too high level mobs and you can easily kill everything and solo every quest. Even elite mobs are soloable if you have full rage and retaliation up, or go prot and keep the mob stun locked with concussion blow and revenge stuns.
---

I was tanking a dungeon for my friend in retail recently and he dc‚Äôd . Less than 5 seconds after he did there was a vote kick option and before I had a chance to type hold up the others had already kicked him. From dc to being kicked in less than 10 seconds... I replied in party ‚ÄúMy buddy just dc‚Äôd maybe give people a second before just insta kicking. Gl on the run‚Äù then left.
---
He was by far the highest dps then next was me as a tank.

I love it, and I'm so glad they got back together as friends and even Salem was cool with it

I‚Äôve always thought spriests where great in premades because they can do good single target and shield people still.
---
I‚Äôd rather a warlock always, but I wouldn‚Äôt say no, especially in the spriest was good on coms/good player
---
That's the thing, they don't have to police anything.  They let the population of the server do the policing and if someone finds something they turn in a ticket with the link to blizz.  It's really quite easy and everyone is happy.
---
St(reeeeeeeeee)amer privilege
---
Well, both? But Warriors will get almost twice the amount of raid spots as Mages when you count both Fury and Prot. A good progression guild will probably have 3-4 Prot Warriors and 6-8 Fury Warriors, removing Rogue slots for the Fury Warriors, and then they'll have around 5-7 Mages.
---
This is of course hypothetical. Raid makeups are determined as much by player availability, social dynamics, and interpersonal relationships as they are by "theoretically best setups". But Fury Warriors are just so stupidly good (and Arms as well in Horde guilds with Windfury weaving) that they simply skew the class balance entirely. Warrior is the only class that truly has multiple competent talent trees in any particular raid, let alone hypercompetent, so a given raid could legitimately have 1/4 Warriors and 3/4 everybody else.
---
Same here. In case you haven't seen it, I even made a little guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bss8ef/dagger_rogue_guide_leveling_talents_and_dagger/ (at the very least I think you'll find the dagger list useful) #selfpromo
---
To me that sounds ridiculous, play the game for what it is, don't seek an advantage.
---
They had add-ons in Vanilla. Perhaps add-ons don't make a player better, they just give him more information to make decisions on. Don't attribute someone's skill to their use of add-ons.
---
20% of the server is warriors. 2% of them are willing to tank.
---
Just the debuffs that reduces their armor and elemental resists. And dots.
---
On my server in BC, the go-to method was pretty much "convince the loot master that you should be able to roll on that item". Which honestly worked pretty well, because by late BC when I started raiding it was generally pretty clear who an item was designed for.
---
It sounds shifty as fuck and wide open to abuse, but it actually worked pretty well. If someone was a selfish arsehole about it, they'd just get kicked from the raid because nobody wants to play with them. Most people would pass on minor upgrades or sidegrades if someone else clearly needed the gear more than them. It was pretty nice.
---
The fact that you needed to actually say *WHY* you were rolling on something seemed to dissuade people from rolling on unneccessary stuff, since making some weak excuse on why you deserve to roll on the item when someone else obviously needs it would tarnish your reputation.
---
I don't think it would work today though. It only really worked on my server because the vast majority of PUG raiders were fairly generous people who hated selfish behavior. That kind of mentality is hard to find online these days.
---
Are you doing it right? 
---
Barkskin into hurricane then bear form and swipe spam should have you crushing those early dungeons. It could also be true that your gear is just too shitty in which case you'll want to run some dungeons first.
---
Now please take into consideration that everything you just said pertains to HUMAN history of swords designed for use by HUMANS.
---
A short sword, hand and half or two handed sword for a human in the past absolutely was most effective how they came to be.
---
This sword however is designed to be used and weilded by a Troll. Which is significantly taller and stronger than a Human.
---
The Destroyer of Worlds was named such because it Destroyed Worlds., In the sense that it was used to slaughter the Trolls enemies. 
---
This sword isn't meant to be used in combat vs other swords, it's meant to slaughter people while mowing through inferior weapons/defenses.
---
That being said, looks aside, I would much rather use it on the recurve side, especially when slashing because the pull that is part of any slash (like you correctly mentioned above) would cover more surface of the sword without risk of glancing AND the way the tip curves would add a deeper cut at the end, even as the target pulled away from your attack.
---
This is a slaughtering weapon that I believe is very subtily designed to pay hommage to Deaths Scythe.
---
If you're going casual then it does not matter and you can play whatever you want.
---
If you're more serious then you should be prepared to heal your way up to the r13. You're not going to be welcome in raiding guilds of a hardcore part of the spectrum as DPS.
---
Wish I knew the answer but maybe someone in beta knows
---
Cool thanks!
---
Strafing is broken in classic right now. If you have anything targeted you just turn left and right you don't actually strafe.
---
shadow priests melt face in pvp
---
thank you for reply &lt;3
---
He's playing Everquest.
---
If an addon affects how someone interacts with other people in the game then yes it does affect everyone including people who aren‚Äôt using it.
---
You have no idea what wow classic endgame is then. End game is just more grinding...Those rewards you need to grind reputations. Grind your profession. Grind for gold. Grind for your mount. Grind mobs with super low drop-rate. Fishing for hours and hours. This is literally what wow was all about. Even raids there's just a couple item that drop for 40 people. Guild need to farm those raids. You need to farm for the fire resist. Farm for enchants.
---
The leveling part is the best part of the game, you can confirm this with anyone who played before.
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound so bad honestly.
---
It's really not. If this addon became popular it would still only match you with people from the same realm as you, so unlike dungeon finder which works cross-realm, you still have to think about what you say and do to not fuck up your reputation on the server.
---
Holy hell that UI brings back so many memories lol
---
Bummer. It's a great resource.
---
No, everyone has access to dungeon finder in this scenario and the addon isn't built into the game. Your comparing apples and kittens.
---
to detect the invisible
---
Ah to be young again. I wish I could play classic for the first time and not know anything about the game. 
---
You will see in August. Good luck new timer.
---
All im saying is make addons universal, make them so everyone can access easy and virus free just a simple click before you log in. Why is this so hard for people to grasp! make the playing field even! not someone who gains an advantage by an amazing addon!
---
And if they don't stop it'll become the norm, more and more automation for addons like that. Hopefully i'm wrong. (:
---
You gonna dual wield tank in  P1???
---
Funny, most of the people who are against this are quite toxic about it.  
---
As I stated above, blizz doesn't have to police this, the servers can police themselves.   
---
Who knows what server the streamers are going to roll on, who knows what servers the streamers will transfer to/ or reroll on later.  Who knows which server the next big name in streaming will get his start on.  
---
Having streaming free servers eliminates all those who knows.
---
Lol viruses in 2019
---
For leveling you pretty much use whatever has the highest top-end damage in your main-hand and whatever has the highest DPS in your off-hand with a preference for faster weapons. I supposed Humans would have a preference for Swords at every level, but it doesn't really matter. You don't start putting points in any weapon specialization (and the only one that matters is Swords) until level 58, so it's no big deal.
---
Until you can get a Perdition's Blade off of Ragnaros and a Core Hound Tooth off of Majordomo (both in Molten Core), there's really no reason to stop being Swords.
---
And even then, Daggers rarely beats out Swords (and pretty much never does if you're Horde because of Windfury Totem).
---
It's not until AQ level gear where Seal Fate Daggers has a fighting chance against Combat Swords, and even then it's iffy. But a lot of rogues go daggers simply because no one else wants them and they're much better in PVP.
---
Just affects the people using it. If you want to make a group you can still spam or whisper people. It doesn't interfere with game functionality. It just makes something easier for the people that want it. Most addons are designed to make something easier whether they are unit frames or decursive.
---
Level 20 Warlock alts were def a thing. I didn't use it to make money but just for things like AQ/BRM/Strat
---
They are universally accessible..there are no viruses.
---
 
---
Where are you downloading your addons from? You clearly don't have any idea what you're talking about.
---
Only if you can actually get good swords, went 7 or so lockouts I think before 1 brutality blade dropped, good luck getting all rogues and warriors geared specially if you‚Äôre alliance.
---
That's 3 houses fully paid off.   I could live without working with that $$ by renting them out.    Shitload of money for nothing done.
---
What classes besides Paladin and Shaman can remove diseases?
---
So youre forced to keyboard turn?
---
Lame
---
It really isn‚Äôt. Especially when you consider Meeting Stones outside instances were in Vanilla which most people had no idea what they did which is queue you up and auto add you to a group. Bet the OP didn‚Äôt know that.
---
It's easier to work that way. Everyone is my friend unless you prove otherwise!
---
It can do okay in PvP. If I recall correctly those stuns are independent of kidney shot. Early TBC when good maces were easily available via BGs, mace rogues were popular.

I guess we just have differing opinions.
---
I'm a purist and there's nothing wrong with this.
---
Hamstring and rend both works fine for training Sep skill
---
&gt; Hopefully i'm wrong.
---
Let me tell you right now; you are.
---
Does this mean that people are going to use the only same addons, exactly how they worked back in Vanilla?
---
Every class melts faces in pvp though
---
i'm not "toxic against it". if it happened, more power to them, but it's not going to happen. why would Blizzard waste man-power and effort in policing this? there's no point when the problem is a handful of streamers that are probably going to all roll on the same server together. streamers servers aren't going to be hidden, at all, because people are obsessive with fucking and trolling with them. even if they aren't streaming, people are gonna find Asmongold, Sodapoppin, Esfand, etc. within an hour of the game launching, if that.
---
Why are people downvoting you? This is fucking retarded. I'm a mage myself and this is literally so true, as a mage if you pop all of your cooldowns and you're decent you'll win against most other bad players, but playing against higher skilled players it isn't easy and is an extremely skillful class with a huge skill ceiling, and warlock is one of the hardest matchup. Everything in Nuclear Meatball's comment is 100% true and the people who downvoted him are fucking retarded.
---
This is 100% false. Nowhere has blizzard ever stayed that Vulpera will be a playable race.
---
No jaw is best jaw.
---
Meeting stones in Vanilla had more automation than this. This still at least requires manual input.
---
So bleeds work well.
---
Stock Google image. All I have from this image is the tabard actually.
---
Take a look at https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm for leveling tips (and the site has a bunch of other useful tidbits as well).
---
Apparently even mentioning the name of a pserver gets your comment removed, so for the DPS guide I mentioned, just search "Oto's Rogue Guide".
---
I resubbed to Retail bc I wanted that Beta chance and I can have a little bit of fun with transmog/mount/dungeon runs. 
---
With that said, I'm levelling a new character but I'll probably stop playing the new content once I get to the Azerite grind part. That really kills the game for me. I just find it so damn unfun having to do Island Expeditions and world quests.
---
Also phasing fucking sucks. I have seen one person out of idk how many in the open world that was actually from my server. 1 person at level 88. That's just sad. Classic couldn't come sooner.
---
Ahhh one of the reasons I really don't like retail anymore...
---
Is the set bonus cdr on intercept relevant?
---
Oh jungle cleave was a thing back then, it just wasn't top tier. But it was good.
---
Linkin is a good one. Especially since it starts from a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù quest starter. 
---
Also the horde Test of.... where at one point you leap of faith off a bluff in 1k needles. 
---
Alliance have the loose Delias chains that circulate you around the human lands and lasts for 20 or so levels. 
---
Finally the fallen hero chain that starts on the edge of blasted lands. (Rewards a 16 slot bag, btw.)
---
Priest, any dwarf
---
This, all this is doing is providing a GUI to spamming LFG/LFM in trade chat
---
Druids are better at generating threat than warriors tho???
---
Also, for raid, should I go prot or fury? Which one is easier to get spot?
---
i levelled my first ever character in vanilla as a balance druid. had a blast, loved being a boomkin! my advice is be 12 years old and have no idea what you're doing, the levels will sail right by
---
You can RP on other servers as well, it's just you can't guarantee other people will join in.  I'm sure if you look hard enough you can find some people that will do it with you on a pvp server.
---
Blizzard allows multiboxers, and they basically ruined honorbuddy a few years ago. What's your problem? 
---
And yeah I'll sell excess gold to guildies. Try to catch me rwt!
---
I don't see why you don't think a single allaince wouldn't run in and fireblast or something and completely nullify the legitimacy of any duel if it was in an contested territory. People messing around with stacking is 100% better, The best solution would be setting up warlocks in different locations in uncontested zones around the map, and having the contestants and the host be ported by the locks when dumb fucks are messing around with it
---
I played a Troll Warrior for years and loved it.
---
Their bow animation is by far the best in the game.
---
Warrior. Paladin was the easiest (not fastest). You could probably do a Game of Thrones rewatch and be 60 before you know it.
---
You should edit this comment, it‚Äôs spreading misinformation.
---
We have been waiting for like almost 2 years since the announcement. We can wait a little bit more.
---
MODS
---
Don't like it? Don't use it. Live and let live, why try to deny other people what they enjoy
---
Tbh im sure new ones will be developed but I imagine the old ones will work with classic like they do private servers
---
What do you plan on going to do when your level 60?
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in PvP.
---
im hoping this is satire
---
Logic? We can't have that!
---
I hope they name servers after random items in Vanilla. 
---
Linkin‚Äôs Boomerang
---
Wicked Claw
---
Dreamfoil
---
Swiftness Potion
---
Or deepcut names
---
Broodlord Mandokir
---
Mr. Smite
---
General Rejaxx
---
echayakee
---
I'm more bitter about "summer" being 3 weeks away from fall.. dicks could've released it in mid-late june when summer actually begins so ppl could still enjoy it before going back to school
---
As there were in the beginning, there are now and ever shall be Addons in WoW.
---
#nochanges.
---
Addons have been a part of WoW since the Vanilla Beta 15+ years ago.
---
2nd tank doesnt have to be all prot and in raids aoe dmg from tanks dont really matter that much, warriors can handle all aoe threat situations just fine.
---
Oh you sweet summer child. Goodluck raging out every couple of hours once it drops. You clearly never played before
---
But will there be too many? Vanilla influence I've seen, but I don't know how pservers have shifted things.
---
You'll probably be able to download the client and add-ons but you won't be able to log in and configure them.
---
I did both stress tests and no longer have the option also. I imagine they disabled so people without beta aren't clogging up the login server hoping for beta lol.
---
If a significant portion of people are relying on a LFG addon than everyone else will have a harder time finding groups. It‚Äôs a slippery slope because people who don‚Äôt want to use it will feel like they have to, which will make it even more necessary for everyone else. 
---
It‚Äôs not the same thing as unit frames or decursive because it affects the community as a whole. 
---
Blizz has already said there are certain social features they want to limit for addons in Classic. If I had to guess I would say this is going to be gone before the game launches.
---
Probably. The beta exists so all the quest data can be easily mined.
---
just because blizz allows it doesn't mean its good for the game.  great, they make more $, at the cost of integrity, wew.
---
and allowing people to play however they want means blizz shouldn't have ruined honorbuddy, that was wrong of them, that's not letting people play how they want to
---
For pvp, daggers. For most of pve, swords
---
Simple. If anyone starts to get too close, the onlookers who actually care about the tourney could just kill them before they could mess it up
---
listen
---
you DON"T need AQ/NAXX gear.
---
you're the scariest burster in the game as ele
---
everyone is talking about naxx and aq40 for viability. that's totally bullshit
---
you need to realize while everyone is in phase 1 ... they also have phase 1 gear. the only class that's going to scale crazy in phase 1 are warriors. bonereavers and even just arcanite reaper and they'll be gods
---
phase 1 shaman have plenty of burst to nuke anyone, and it only gets better as the phases go on
---
phase 1 you're going to have t2 helm(or green lens), deep earth shoulders, t2 legs, t1 gloves, wildthorn mail, same caster rings/necks available to everyone else and some decent dungeon belts, rings etc
---
people bring up paladins.
---
look. paladins are great, they're SUPER fucking easy to play with the blessings auras and heals. they make alliance a far easier faction to play as. good alliance team will roll over almost anyone with ease just because of that, and the individualistic nature of horde players (shadow priests, enhance shamans etc)
---
but heres the thing. shaman have a much higher skillcap. theyre harder to master. but overall i think the meta favors horde just because of shaman. its just that everyone plays them wrong and ignores their strengths. in bgs and smaller pvp youve got to know that you're the shot caller and can nuke ANYONE from orbit. 
---
due to the lag of lightning bolt and the speed of chain lightning and shocks, even in bwl phase gear you can burst out 5k+ damage in the span of 4 seconds
---
That would be fine, but wow isn't about practical weapons, you know. The falx was a devastating weapon (the Romans had to change their armor because the Dacians were using falx's to sever limbs), but had the drawback of being a 2-handed and wasn't well suited against shield walls. It is perfectly fine for a weapon in wow, though.
---
You have to feed it food it likes
---
Olympic sprinters are secretly bad athletes because they need to optimize their training when they could just as easily run 100 meters without doing that.
---
If you blame on addons the fact you fall behind then you're just bad
---
will the macro api from bfa be in classic?
---
**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it‚Äôs about nostalgia, for others it‚Äôs about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren‚Äôt aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We‚Äôre looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people‚Äôs schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message @Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
/S????
---
It increases in loyalty the longer you keep your pet happy. With higher loyalty levels your pet will require less food to stay happy.
---
Great response.
---
You can ONLY feed pets food they like.. I had a raptor and you can only feed it meat, and that was the example I gave going through an entire stack in 30 minutes.
---
Looks like it was effort enough, though.
---
In the case I'm thinking of you'd only be buying 2 things. A used prebuilt (usually a Dell Optiplex) and a graphics card. Availability depends on your location obviously, but in my experience these older systems are everywhere as businesses upgrade hardware.
---
Reeeee
---
No changes
---
Fucking bread and butter for tanking (hi rag), especially until you get big dick enough to wear savage glad.
---
I feel like you're having way to many warriors for progression? 2 prot tanks + your 6 fury warriors, out of the 6 fury you'd have other offtanks as needed. I could be wrong but that seems like it'd hinder you
---
Turn and strafe away
---
What level raptor and what level food?
---
Ahhh that makes more sense, forgot about the loyalty system..
---
what ? Just bind your strafe key dude  
---
I played stress tests and I had no problem strafing
---
I'd almost guarantee this'll be the case lol. It was a non issue on live and it'll be a non issue when classic is out.
---
All the things you described, but the motive behind them works differently.
---
Yo what, my undead rogue drawing is half finished, I was going to post him here tomorrow!
---
Raider looking for Guild
---
Experienced raider looking for a guild that raids on days not named Tuesday and Thursday. I have experience with Server First raiding through multiple expansions and vanilla. Prefer Wends/Weekend (Any time after regular work hours) raid schedules or if on Tues/Thursday they would need to start late.
---
I will be raid ready within a month of launch. My ultimate goal for Classic is to build a strong guild community to enjoy the experience with.
---
If you need any additional info please ask. I plan on playing a Hunter though I can migrate to another class if absolutely needed.
---
Horde PvP NA highly desired. 
---
[NA][H][PvP]
---
Is this low effort? I cant tell.
---
When you strafe don't you face the direction you're strafing?
---
Ban add ons, leveling guides, class guides, talent calculators, and anything else that gives anyone any potential edge over my lazy ass!  Wtf Blizzard...dooo it!!!!
---
Help you save your dm buff if there is a sneaky shaman outside the entrance purging buffs away
---
I know at least two remarkably intact reasons.
---
I ran a lot of pugs in Vanilla and BC. Had DKP for some (the weekly recurring ones) and for the random throw togethers I didn't put many rules on them outside of pulling your weight or be kicked.
---
It's fine to reserve items if you specify that from the get go.
---
It's fine to have tier rules if you specify that from the get go.
---
The big thing is regardless of what rules you use, everyone knows what they are before you start. Nothing worse than getting into a group killing half the raid only to find out some thing(s) are on reserve.
---
No they weren't. They did some concept work on Hellfire peninsula, but it was never planned to be in Vanilla like Karazhan was

Same faction griefing has always been a bannable offence. If that guy was alliance he wouldn't have been banned.

You are facing wherever the camera is facing. As long as the mob isn't at greater than 90 degrees relative to the camera, you shouldn't have any issues with taking extra damage.
---
Maybe I was little too...offputting about our chances early on...if you put int he work to gather gear you can and will 1-2 shot people of equal gear. For the sake of doing so I put together a list for you/anyone who might be interested.

**These items are only my OPINION as to what would be a best Pre-Raid PVP set for an Ele Shaman, I am fully aware there are some slots with better cloth/leather pieces but if you wear too much cloth/leather you are going to be shredded, save the cloth/leather for slots we dont have better options for**

Damn. Not even rank 10? I'm avoiding melee classes because I don't want to grind the weapons lol.
---
If Ele is fine without all that raid gear I'll stick with it. Just wasn't sure if they're like Warrior and need (from what I hear) gear.
---
"Too many" is a matter of whether something is detrimental to a raid. The only way I'd see extra Fury Warriors as being "too many" is in fights that aren't melee friendly, at which point the guild may need to bring in more Mages and Warlocks. But in the vast majority of content, ten Warriors is not too many at all. They're simply flatly better than all other DPS specs in the game when it comes to raw damage, and if every fight was simply a DPS race instead of including mechanics that favor or require certain classes (and it was possible to gear the raid), the best guild would contain X tanks, X healers, and Fury Warriors for every single DPS slot. This doesn't happen because, well, fights *do* have mechanics that require non-Fury Warriors, and it would be impossible to gear 25 Fury Warriors with how Vanilla loot works.
---
Thats not what im talking about. If you target something your character does not strafe correctly. Your character literally turns left or right and walks in that direction. If you dont target something it works correctly.
---
Your best bet would be looking at what items you can make on ClassicDB. While you are at it look at the different recipes the 3 types of end game LW can make, and decide what type you want to go.
---
Frostadamus has a great video guide on making money AFKing by essentially mass crafting nightscape headband and vendoring them, with material from the AH.
---
As for leveling the shaman, enhancement never runs out of Mana, can still heal dungeons.
---
&gt;ies will miss raids and you won't get to use it. Also depending on how much you plan on tanking 5 man's you'll probably want
---
Holy Shock as a ranged pulling tool does sound really awesome. I'll definitely be trying this out, as I'd like to be able to tank dungeons with respeccing often.
---
2006 Vanilla experience, LOL.

I read your question again. And I guess I was tierd. If you play your rotation correctly you will have 100% SnD uptime. Spending your combo points to make that happen is what your rotation will be. Its situational. Play around with it and you'll get it quite fast.
---
&gt; i'm not "toxic against it".  "this is the most retarded crap i've heard."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; "but it's not going to happen. "  
---
&gt;You don't know this anymore than I do.  What I do know is if blizz thinks it might cost them money if they don't offer streaming free servers, they'll offer them in a heartbeat.  
---
&gt;" why would Blizzard waste man-power and effort in policing this because of a few popular streamers. "  
---
&gt;As I said, blizz would not have to police it, the serve would police itself.    
---
&gt;"  what if someone with 100 viewers that's brand new and doesn't know  about this rule starts streaming their gameplay? are you gonna demand  they get banned or quarantined on another server? "  
---
&gt;The servers would be clearly marked as no streaming servers.  If you stream on them no matter how many viewers you are subject to temp ban and full ban if you continue.  
---
&gt;" there's no point when the problem is a handful of streamers that are probably going to all roll on the same server together.  "  
---
&gt;Can you guarantee me that?  Can you guarantee they will never reroll or transfer to my server?  Can you guarantee that the newest latest and greatest streamer won't get his start on my server?
---
Amazing how many people take the bait.
---
You're putting words in people's mouths lol. No one has ever said Botting should be a thing because players should play games how they want to. Botting is cheating, which is a obvious answer. Camping lowbies in redridge for days is not. Sitting on people dueling is not.

 #nochanges
---
Is it truly a 180 degree sector that determines where Blizzard applies their "extra protection against a mob you are facing" algorithm? My guess is it'd be more like a 90 degree sector
---
Then it has been updated. But still no RP-PVP confirmed right?
---
This sub HATES tips for a variety of retarded reasons.
---
This is a really useful link! Especially that race chart. Dwarf Rogue is shocking compared to the others. I guess the only perk is the added survivability but I think orcs have them beat on that as well. What‚Äôs the value of find treasure then?
---
Completely disregarding rested exp that is
---
I'll keep this guild in mind for when Classic is closing in! :)
---
I never remember PuGs in vanilla either, it was just asking to be ninja looted if something really good dropped, much less trying to make sure everyone knew the fights + finding 40 people.
---
The rear 90? I dunno. I always just assume its 180 to be safe.
---
Yah lol... Goddamn the classic community is the spergiest. Dude throws a fun event and everyone just shits on him
---
This is a joke right? Like you don‚Äôt actually believe this is a good idea right?
---
Ok thanks. I think you confirmed what I was thinking.
---
 There is ab easily obtained soft cap on defence while leveling which is to gain enough to reach the level cap.
---
Would you say that this statement is true?
---
Thank you for the additional information
---
You Classic kids need to stop getting so ass blasted when people mention the existence of a world outside your bubble.
---
wait the classic wow servers are out? shoot looks like missed it, maybe next restart.
---
Exposed
---
Some items on reserve. TF bindings, bijous and mounts pretty standard.
---
&gt;Get a level 1 rogue to the opposite faction capital. Wait for a duel to finish, then suprise kill the loser.  You'll get murdered instantly but it's worth the lols.
---
No summon stones in classic.  If they are summoning it'll be from a warlock inside the dungeon.
---
The world has moved forward since classic and the wow community will as well. Blizzard can't stop this type of system so might as well embrace it. Even if they were to disable the addon, it would be immediately turned into a website which isn't something they can ban. 
---
I still don't see how this hurts anyone. You say it does but it doesn't disable chat or auto ignore whispers.
---
RIP T-Bag
---
If you do it around when you're leaving the valley you should
---
leather, mail, plate, nothing is safe.
---
botting is only cheating because blizzard arbitrarily decided it should be.  just like addons are not cheating because blizzard arbitrarily decided they should not be.  the point of the thread is to change the rules on addons
---
im not putting words in peoples mouth, playing however you want covers everything, it's saying that nothing should be considered cheating
---
I mean, I didn‚Äôt. I started in Wrath but my first max level Nelf was in Legion, so all I knew until that comment was that you could run through mobs to get to a point then shadowmeld to drop all aggro. It‚Äôs not some big hivemind, I don‚Äôt share your knowledge.
---
Wait, it guarantees it? At every skill level? Or only at the really low levels when every hit is a guaranteed skill up?
---
No changes? You're not going to use the exact same addons, exactly the way they worked in vanilla. You're going to use more, new, and better addons. I assume.
---
Fap and go fap and go, get into these mother fuckers, get into these mother fuckers!
---
Holy fucknuts that is amazing, as is the Nax trailer.
---
Thanks, next time i want to learn how to be a garbage hunter, ill let you know.

---
Lol beat you to it! Your art looks super impressive, I can‚Äôt wait to see it!
---
Bro you popped retaliation against a mage and a resto druid. You'd think after years of playing WOW you would have any idea what you were doing.. Apparently not..
---
Embarrassing
---
I doubt it will be that bad.
---
I been playing a Paladin for last like 12 years lol. I dunno I just popped whatever who gives a shit
---
Theres too many fucking races now, like 1 for each faction was special in BC and Cata, then Pandas split for MOP, BFA has 3 fucking allied races PLUS Mechnogomes and these rat fuckers. Blizzard needs to realize adding 50 more god damn races wont make retail any more fun all it's going to do is convolute the story further.             
---
               
---
I agree with a post on r/wow I think they are gearing up to split the factions for an upcoming Warcraft 4 and then do some serious revamping as WoW 2. Why else make Sylvanas the bad guy and Anduin not help the Night Elves?
---
I remember spending a whole Saturday morning running sunken temple. Our group had one person who sort of knew it, but was guiding us based on that knowledge and help from thotbot. In hindsight the huge puzzle circle wasn't a huge payoff, but experiencing it while we explored it for the first time ever was truly a great experience. RIP dungeons in all MMOs that have been chopped up for  mass consumption in 20 minutes. DM, l/ubrs, brd, strat, and vanilla scholo. Fornost and Carn Dum from LotRO also come to mind.
---
Kalimdor is a chicken and Eastern Kingdoms is a levitating gnome wearing a wizard hat, change my mind.
---
Em...barr...assing
---
Yes, especially that room right before the boss area.
---
But that 70 gold early on in a server may be worth more than 200 later on.
---
It‚Äôs basic economics, money now is worth more than money later.
---
\+1 reply
---
Ah must‚Äôve been thinking of tbc
---
Then how does Horde get one?
---
Thanks professor.
---
Are you alright? I know what the thread topic is but this sub-discussion is about letting players play how they want, and you made low effort shitposts about it..
---
This is exactly what I was looking for, thanks mate
---
Unarmored horses and cats look better than armored. Armored chickens are better though.
---
Yeah still no RP-PVP confirmed
---
"You go to BRD with the Group you have ‚Äì not the Group you might wish you have"

I have 9 gamecards ready to go so 1.5 years of gametime and didn't even pay for them. Got them free for filling up surveys.
---
World buffs should have never been a thing in instances tbh, it should have been restricted to outdoor content
---
&gt;PvE there is zero reason to run any spriests and no one will.
---
You run at least one spriest for the dark resist debuff, since it buffs all warlocks dmg.
---
Suken temple is my favorite vanillia dungeon. It was the around that time that I finally felt had a full understanding of my classes toolkit *mage* and my game play was reaching a higher level of skill and consistency. I also love all troll content. It never felt that long or daunting because I was just having so much fun CC-ing.
---
Oof, a liberal in 2019, pure tragedy.
---
I'm top on my friends list and got in on the 24th and haven't lost it since.  Was there another factor?  He even texted me before I got the e-mail.
---
Spending over 300 mana for a charge each time would, unwise, one would think. Especially when you're also ranged or have travel form
---
How about "Waterboy"? I liked that movie.
---
When did you get added? My friend recently got a job at Blizzard and added me as F&amp;F, but it took probably a week for the beta invite to come to me (got it May 28).
---
I do this on real life.
---
Realistically prices early on for everything will be lower, so I‚Äôd much rather get 70 gold for an item and use that to buy everything I need to level up/gear faster.
---
If you‚Äôre telling people to hold on to items to make more gold later on, it‚Äôs not the best advice. Always invest in your character first.
---
If you want more basic economics lessons, khan academy has some great beginner courses that could help you out!
---
Cool! I never saw this episode before.  Pretty funny.  I do remember the one where he takes over as raid leader from another player in a cyber cafe.
---
dang, really? :(
---
Just stick her on hunter. Not only gets a cute pet of her choosing but only really has a couple of abilities to ever worry about, especially if you play a melee class that means she doesn‚Äôt have to do melee combat herself
---
Makes sense. I can‚Äôt remember if I used to do this or not!
---
Lol. Beta testing classic is literally the last possible thing I'd want to do in my free time right now. Only salt I have is people treating Beta like it's the actual game and not putting any kind of focus or emphasis on bug reporting.
---
humble brag much
---
Touch√© sir
---
70 gold within the first 2 weeks is definitely not going to be available to everyone - but hey if you want to make 70g instead of potentially waiting a week or two to let the economy actually grow on a fresh server - be my guest since you like to only work in black and white and every valuable item must be as valuable as another...
---
Have fun on your 40% mount!
---
I'm just gonna upvote this to the top so everyone does this instead of something smart, like engineering.,
---
Mage blinking in. Rogues stealthing up to duelers. Paladins bubbling. That wouldn't work. Especially with paladins.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since 2005. I realize I‚Äôm much more experienced in the game. I‚Äôm not trying to brag. Just asking for suggestions.
---
This is all well and good but for my work i go away for, 14 days at a time :( so i can't be your friend haha.
---
But in saying this the people i keep in contact with are aware of the work schedule and i try and leave a real ID note saying I'm off for work for x weeks.
---
But it's hard to get friends in this game these days which is annoying.
---
It was in burning crusade because I didn't hit max until BC, but...
---
 I got the bear mount the first time in a new guild, running Zul'Aman for my first speed clear.
---
My graphics card also broke that week, so I didn't log in for several weeks and the guild kicked me for inactivity/thinking I basically took the mount and ditched them.
---
Cheers mate. Look forward to seeing more of your work.
---
The blacksmithing mace also gave a really nice haste buff.
---
Well if you think it‚Äôll take 2 weeks for a servers economy to mature, you probably should go look up those basic Econ lessons.
---
Most people won‚Äôt have even hit 60 by then.
---
Low skill mage and low skill warlock are still pretty useful. See how well she summons drinks/healthstones .
---
&gt; Uh yes it is. 
---
No it's not, it doesn't deserve a ban at all. Of course, doing this is really childish. I mean, fooling around for a bit is fine, but disturbing the whole thing for a long period of time is really a douchey thing to do, i agree on that.   
---
But he didn't do anything "wrong" he just messed with other people from the other faction. 
---
They just should have kill the people that were disturbing and farm their corpses. But maybe they were afraid that this could turn out in an all out fight..
---
If you've never experienced Elwynn &gt; Westfall &gt; Redridge &gt; Duskwood then I'd say go for it. You really get a sense of a kingdom slowly falling apart.
---
I'm in beta and was testing this the other day. It only procs off the cast, not each missile. Same with any AOE. It's per cast not per hit. Private servers were bugged in that it was off each tick of damage. 
---
Other clearcast questions i looked into. For projectile spells it procs when the spell lands. For insta-cast or spells with no travel time it's as soon as you cast. For channel spells it's when the channelling begins. With AM there is a slight delay between when you cast and when the missiles go off, and it procs right in there, as the first missile comes out.
---
Defense rating beyond your level cap is still going to reduce your chance to be hit and crit and still increase your chance to dodge, parry, and block, it just can't reduce your chance to be crushed until you reach level 60 and even then it's only because you have so much other avoidance that you can't be crushed.
---
440 defense is the point where bosses can no longer crit you, which means you need to come up with 130 defense from your gear. But this is really only for a few bosses that hit like a truck (Chromaggus, Nerfarian, and Patchwerk for example). A good tank maximizes the amount of threat they can generate without losing so much avoidance that you're assigned healers can't keep you up. This is why so many tanks actually spec Fury and don't use a shield at all.
---
That was my thought originally with mage for sure. I think we may try warlock. See how it goes
---
That's stupid.   And leads me to believe people will get banned for excessive corpse camping.  (Streamers) Which shouldn't be the case.
---
Well in raids you dint nees that many, and those 2% will be able to raid all they want.
---
Waterboi
---
Gear I had on, as well as in the bank.
---
Sword spec :p the ultimate debuff
---
Early on Strat was 10 man, it was soon changed with the addition of the Anthema/Benediction questline, though UBRS/LBRS kept the 10 man.
---
Well I did level as Balance until level 30ish and respeced several times at 60 to try it again and let me tell you!...            
---
              
---
It fucking sucks. Like your DPS is complete trash in PVE and leveling, like questing, your going to have a VERY fucking rough time of it on top of fights lasting twice as long than they need to. PvP it's actually kind of fun but mainly just for rooting flag carriers or runners low on health so your team mates can catch them easy, 1v1 you wont and cant beat anyone, not unless you root, run and heal a lot and even then you'll be completely oom if you manage to not die.              
---
                
---
I dont like to tell people how to play because I main tanked as a druid all through Vanilla so i'm not leet at all but I promise you, theres hardly any leather spell damage gear, you'll be fighting other casters for weapons and thats if anyone is willing to bring you, it's a really depressing experience.
---
not a big fan of the idea of it being centered around pets, myself
---
Manual crowd pummeler
---
Honestly, I'd put her on the Starter Edition of Retail. It's much more forgiving and will give her all the basics of the game.
---
When Strat was a 10-man, UBRS and LBRS were 15-man.
---
I am mostly interested in the exchange rates or issues we will see between people trading gold on classic for gold on retail to buy tokens and fund their sub/blizz balance for other games.  With no token like in retail its going to be trade with real players or the bots/cgf's, just to many people that will want classic items/mounts but not have the time to farm the gold for it all and be in the market to buy.
---
Great!
---
Sounds like an awesome type of marketing *   
---
^* ^What ^I ^meant ^was: ^I ^have ^zero ^knowledge ^in ^marketing ^but ^I ^just ^want ^this ^to ^happen.
---
I would say Hunter class wouldn't be too bad. Kiting mobs might be a little difficult to learn, but you really don't have to do that as a hunter if you don't want to.
---
That‚Äôs an old format. Holy shit
---
Asmon hasn't stopped playing WoW for long enough in over a decade to have committed fraud on anywhere near that level (no offense intended). Doubt he would have done something like that anyways. Scamming a few players here and there for gear back in the day is quite a bit different than big-time construction contract related fraud.

Humans want all other races, even their allies, extinguished. They‚Äôre the Nazis.
---
Night Elves are responsible for the planet nearly destroying itself time and time again. They‚Äôre the Russians.
---
Dwarves fight amongst themselves and dig shit up they shouldn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre the Australians.
---
Gnomes just make cool shit no one thinks is very useful. They‚Äôre the Swiss.
---
Orcs just don‚Äôt want to be slaves, to demons or anyone else. They‚Äôre the African Americans.
---
Trolls just want a home. They‚Äôre the Israelis.
---
Tauren just want people to love the planet. They‚Äôre the Canadians.
---
Undead just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King. They‚Äôre the White Americans.
---
So just ask yourself: do you want to be the good guys or the baddies?
---
You‚Äôre the consumer, you want it... means good marketing haha means you‚Äôre good at marketing. Makes sense in my head.

It‚Äôll take you damn close to the top. It might be every other cast for the last fifty points. 
---
This is a great technique for maxing weapon skills in an hour
---
Looks like someone wasn‚Äôt good enough for private servers.
---
If you're a very casual player, try them all! Pick a storyline you like from the starting area, and roll with it.
---
I don't know what to tell you, that's just not true. You probably have some setting messed up.  
---
First guess would be camera auto-following, I don't know exactly though.
---
Lok'tar.
---
Does a frost wand count?
---
You‚Äôre 100% correct. My memory is fuzzy from back then.
---
These screenshots are super fantastic.
---
Yeah, I'm using a 1.5 attack speed dagger and I am spec arms/fury for the rage gain and stance dance
---
I've played a couple MUD's for over twenty years, mostly over the computer thing... running the same one they got me since 1995, and just getting hooked on them. Sometimes you can't get the same type of gameplay that you can in a graphical game. 
---
We've fallen into a pit of QoL changes that have actually been worse for gaming. Time to go back and have more fun and difficult challenges.
---
Great write up! Couldn't agree more on utilizing all of the class's strengths and switching it up. Can you elaborate on the spirit multipliers? I wasn't aware of this for druid.
---
You and me both brother. Its been interesting to see post Cata WoW though. I've had some fun wandering around.
---
Yes.
---
That one is definitely more technically complex and edited, but I still like the Naxxramas the movie one better. https://youtu.be/Rp5JNSGkBDA  Both are incredibly bad ass though.
---
If you haven't experienced the Alliance, why not use that to make feel even more *new*? In the end, it doesn't matter. Pick what interests you most.
---
What‚Äôs this? Tell me more.
---
So no mace ever?
---
Why are we laughing? Probably because asmon and tips are NA and we don't have to deal with the sperg army.
---
John was the man, not sure why you brought that up. Plenty of British/EU wow streamers worth watching, they also don't come with the hive mind morons, have fun in NA. :thumbsup:
---
Swords and daggers are fine.  You really shouldn‚Äôt go daggers unless you get lucky with a Felstriker drop pre raid.  Swords are far easier to get your hands on.
---
&gt; This is a significant source of raw cash that did not exist before that will exist now so gaining gold will be much easier.
---
I think it's like 1g per quest at lvl 60, and a quest takes at least 10 minutes, let's say 20 minutes on average.  3g per hour is nothing.  And lower lvl quests give a lot less.
---
He is correct. Start attacking a mob, strafe right, and **look** at your animation.
---
I knew people that would steal the game for the free month in it
---
Remember, no Zandali.
---
personally, i wouldnt interpret that much into lore.
---
imo blizzard someday found out that new races are easy money and went overboard with them, diluting/diminishing their product heavily with that.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt everyone be going after swords though? And picking an alternative weapon keep you ahead of the curve rather than seeking hand me downs from guildies?
---
Begone foul lich, your twisted corpse belongs in the earth not on a horse!

In addition to the tauren blocking everyone's view, a bunch of horde mages teamed up to kill the alliance spectators.
---
[Look at this fat fucking sapper charge.](https://i.imgur.com/ddqYte9.png)

Hopefully Blizzard can check their reference client, but I do have some clips from a popular TBC arena player, Menismyforte, that might give evidence that these interactions are CORRECT.
---

https://gyazo.com/471a635340ceb46455d0a79d774a6a8d
---
Here you can see that he's being attack from a COMICAL distance.
---
These clips are from Summer 2008~(Patch 2.4.3), so very late TBC. US servers and ping on the priest is under 100, unsure about enemy ping.
---
Combing through older videos to find more examples, hopefully Blizzard gives some clarity on this.
---
[Here is video evidence](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/425897364?t=131s) that‚Äôs joana the speed leveler showing that when something is targeted your character runs left and right instead of strafing. This bug was still happening during the latest stress test. So I don‚Äôt know what you saw but this is exactly how my character acted the entire time.
---
I 2 manned UBRS as a resto shaman, with a warrior buddy who had thunderfury. We were both in Naxx gear tho.
---
I play retail still, and did my time on pservers and was around in 04.
---
If I smell one iota of shit plays on live pugged group content‚ÄîI‚Äôm outa there. (I‚Äôm not a fucking autist leaving on first death necessarily, I review death logs before deciding).
---
I was in a 5 hour brd run on my last pserver. Didn‚Äôt say shit. Stuck it out. Repaired, helped try to teach people the instance and their class. Made a friend of two.

It‚Äôs a completely different experience when you‚Äôre anonymous.

When I go to 1-2 stop sign towns in Texas, I hold doors for people. When I‚Äôm in Manhattan, get the fuck outta my way‚ÄîI‚Äôve got somewhere to be.
---
Horde if YOURE A REAL MAN.
---
Yeah, gear competition exists, but it exists for a reason.  There‚Äôs no reason at all to go mace in PvE as a rogue... or PvP for that matter.
---
Ah the old hunter forgot arrows drama lol
---
It was, along with the people screaming about the guy lol.
---
So do we unsubscribe now and wait for aug 27th?  I‚Äôm certainly not playing bfa in the meantime
---
I figured it was putting my mouth where my money is as far as supporting a company that finally after a decade or longer is listening to its fans. First time I felt completely alright with giving Blizzard money and I have no intention of logging in until Classic comes out.
---
Its one long hamstring
---
I love sunken temple cause I ‚Äúget it‚Äù. Feels good having ‚Äòthe knowledge‚Äô helping and guiding groups through the dungeon. Same with BRD back in the day, but I feel like everyone knows it now.
---
Is mace seriously that bad? Even if you had dwarf behind it?
---
you don't? what a casual
---
Dire Maul gear is too good. It‚Äôs basically a catch-up thing
---
You want daggers for PvP so you can ambush which is huge burst.
---
And for PvE sword spec gives you a 5% chance to get an extra attack which is HUGE L.  Mace spec gives you chance to stun which works on almost nothing in a raid environment.
---
Ok sure bro I'm bad I got ya
---
In my experience, it began in FF11, when english and japanese speaking players would commonly group together, with the in game translation feature as the only means to communicate.    
---
{Bio} being a spell, it could be used to get the idea across.    
---
WC also became a thing, as apparently water closet is a kinda close translation to bathroom to the japanese.    
---
brb {Bio}, or brb wc just became the way to say quick break.    
---
I'll quote these at around ... um.. 2005?

NA PVP NE Druid looking for a serious PVE guild to call home! I‚Äôm comfortable running any spec for a specific task and will have the gear and gold to back it up. Ideal raid times for me are 23:00-05:00 MST. Please DM me with any questions or with discord information if you‚Äôre looking to talk further!

A more rewarding and satisfying feeling from something so "simple" is priceless, imo.

That gamer ego. I feel you I was like that and what you're saying about being super toxic/elitism and delusional even when sometimes not warranted. &lt;--100% can agree on this. It's good you learned though and acknowledged it!

I'm super stoked to get to the point with gear that I can start trying fury prot.
---
dude Zach has been streaming for a long time, he also has to babysit 80 000 children daily for 8+ hours, patience of a saint, that $3m+ a year is well deserved.

I can barely remember what guilds i was in - ill have to text a friend, on this character i went mainly pvp, and my shaman soon became my main his name is - shamone
---
Humans sound nice.
---
He's not running away from the mob, it's just moving to the next thing you want to do. Always plan ahead and you will save a lot of time.
---
Watch the VoD from Alkaizerx on twitch.  
---
He is speedrunning on some days the leveling process as a Warrior while knowing every quest by memory and so on.  
---
He was a Naxx+Rank 14 warrior back then and is probably the best warrior there is.  
---
He says Hamstring Stuff is the biggest noob mistake you can make.  
---
Watch him level or at least his VoD &gt; He chainpulls basically non stop and if he dies its intended to death warp.  
---
He also does group stuff Solo which he only does now in practice because at launch he will play in a group anyway but its possible as a Warrior.
---
If you guys want to watch a stream from someone that knows what is doing and will start raiding in the very first week watch Alkaizerx and not these losers like Asmongold etc
---
the way the talent trees are set up, to get mace spec, you cannot get the 31 pt talent in either subt. or assass.  so you can spec combat mace, pvp-oriented....it could be interesting.
---
They are a support dps class but will require you to farm soul shards a lot.
---
You said exactly what I was feeling at the moment I resubbed.   I knew my chances were small but I wanted blizzard to notice the spike in subscriptions. I‚Äôm sure subs tripled for last month.
---
Yes... you want daggers in PvP so you can ambush and backstab.  For PvE almost all raid related mobs are immune to stuns, and sword spec gives you 5% chance for double attack which is massive.
---
BIS trucker for all of vanilla gives you 2% chance to get an extra attack for reference.  Sword spec is 150% stronger than that.
---
Give the alliance a try! Worst case scenario you don‚Äôt like it and can switch back to horde. 
---
Dwarves get fear ward which is amazing regardless of spec or content you want to do. 
---
Night elves get a fun shadow ability. They also have my personal favorite alliance starting zone. 
---
If you go back to horde, give undead a try they make awesome shadow priests with devouring plague!
---
I figure biological can also mean things like food or water, so it‚Äôs more all encompassing than bathroom break.
---
Raids and premades,... you won‚Äôt have any easy time getting in. 
---
However, you will have a blast in world pvp. It‚Äôs the kind of class where you can hang out in black rock mountain and fuck up the other factions day. Between fear, levitate, mind control, and swp you can be a real pain in the ass and very hard to catch. 
---
Class is a ton of fun, but not ideal for ‚Äòstructured‚Äô end game content.
---
Well, there are casual players that do want a community. These people also quit the same time a lot of us did in WoTLK.
---
So....too much? Maybe not.
---
Unnecessary? Absolutely.
---
I highly suggest playing a Warlock or Rogue.
---
So many times I wanted to mute my in-game sound in arena because my teammates were constantly jumping back and forth on that stupid and annoying motorcycle !!!
---
That‚Äôs what I did. My beta hopes are over.
---
They've been using Layering throughout the Beta, yeah?
---
My most vivid memories of vanilla are spending hours putting together groups for brd on my Druid
---
Can‚Äôt trust that you are telling the whole story
---
Xroads raids where meta.
---
I made this for my friend who did not understand layering and sharding.
---
Zug zug
---
well, I mean it sounds like that tips dude is going to jail for fraud, so...
---
Raiding the first week? Can‚Äôt imagine 37-40 people getting to cap and some gear in the very first week. Then again, never underestimate the power of a nolifer
---
Yes, although it is not working entirely as intended just yet.
---
Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve had to. Not enough players. They have been using layering on the stress test though
---
Gonna have to hire them all back first
---
You show up with a raid and and people will flag them selves, the lads love a good scrap in Africa.

---
&gt; Sorry paladin, I'm gonna need that pally set shoulders for the int
---
Roll horde, never share plate.
---
Warrior isn't really that much harder to level than rogue or paladin to be honest. Especially with the lower peceived difficulty on Classic compared to pservers and increased regen as well.
---
Expect 17-20% of the lvl 60 population to be Warriors. If you lookup stats from private servers you'll notice Mages, Rogues and Hunters aren't too far from that as well. Considering the demand for tanks and the benefit of stacking DPS warriors in raid, the abundance of the class is far less concerning than hunters or mages which popularity in raid is nothing comparable.
---
You can also expect at least 25% of the players picking Classic for the first time are going to quit early, and another 30% of the warriors are never going to make it to 60 according to private servers stats.
---
Those reasons being?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm going to call bull that that one sentence is what got you banned. a) You either started slinging ad hominem insults at people or b) You kept spamming that over and over and over. There is ALWAYS more to a ‚ÄúI was unjustly banned‚Äù claim.
---
So what's what was in there. I sold my level 60 rogue and my collectors edition on ebay for quite a few hundred dollars back in the day. Kinda wish I kept it but damn that is cool.

send ur left testicle to blizzard HQ with your battletag attached.

Ya Dwarves what I was kind of thinking.
---
Thanks for the response.
---
Now I'm definitely not sure what to do. lol.
---
I would recommend watching the videos below. On private servers but you get the idea.
---
[perplexity: rogue with mediocre gear but insanely skilled](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AM1bSJm6GTE) 
---
[hunter: just found this one. I like that he gives commentary so that you can follow better as to what he is doing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tIRIOxxuUVk)
---
Thanks! Soon! You did a great job here as well :)
---
Alliance is much more fleshed out in vanilla. I've leveled both. They're both fun. Playing through the alliance quest lines is definitely worth it.
---
One of my best memories of vanilla involves Sunken temple. I was running around exploring Swamp of sorrows on my first main (Dwarf Hunter). All of a sudden I see this big structure in the middle of the swamp so I swim out there. I read "Temple of Atal'Hakkar" and give it a quick google search and find out it's a dungeon. For some reason I had never even heard of it, and I think "cool I'll have to run it some time". Then out of nowhere a group with 2 level 60's show up and say "Hey they are running us through. Wanna join?" They proceed to share as many quests as they can and let me go with them. It was awesome. I got so much new gear, xp, and drops. I remember how awesome it felt hearthing back to SW after. Such good times.
---
Sell it on the organ black market then use that money to buy an account off someone with beta access.
---
OK but why is that tips guy not in jail then?
---
Oh god imagine having to choose between watching your paladin autoattack mobs from 55-60 vs watch season 8 again
---
Alliance has Blackjack and Hookers.
---
Link the thread let‚Äôs see it
---
When you say it like that, it actually does make sense :D   
---
Get going Blizzard, make this happen! ^(please)
---
am i the only one not wanting to play beta, even if i had access?
---
LBRS etc at level 5 or level 30 in the beta? We're not all as 1337 as you brah
---
Yo I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never seen this! That shit was dope!
---
wait are there ppl unironically hating on private server players?lmao ok
---
Most people say that Classic feels very different from LH. I think numbers have been tuned and maybe low level resists/misses/dodges/parries are tuned too highly on LH.
---
Can't say that's a bad thing. The relentless whiffing at level 1-20 is just fucking annoying and doesn't really serve any purpose imo
---
2/10, way too obvious
---
Why your left and not your right testicle?
---
Alternatively instead of decay you can set a monthly minimum raid attendance % to loot.
---
We had this:
---
1. Trial members build up dkp during first month working on their % (unless gear was going to get disenchanted).
---
2. If people went inactive for a while and came back,they couldn't just use their stock pile of dkp on the bosses that are now put on farm during their absence.
---
I really wish I had gotten a CE back then instead of just the regular release. Crazy expensive now to get one with the key unused.
---
That‚Äôs not a real gun Rodney.
---
Wells that‚Äôs OP, would make one hell of a flag carrier!
---
This is known as the [false-consensus effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect). Not everyone was around in Classic, and I'm very envious of those who came before. I'd love to have a new plague, assuming it could come from some new undiscovered source and could be added without being datamined.
---
Play private server to quench your thirst for vanilla gameplay otherwise you either gotta become a streamer with a sizable audience or know a blizzard employee personally.
---
Keep in mind there is still lots of time between now and release so there may be a more open beta as well so cross your fingers
---
Literally the case 100% of the times.
---
"I got banned from blizzard forums for asking a simple question, wtf?"
---
- actual situation "goddam blizzard fuckfaces, why did you change this thing that nobody fucking wanted? I hope your dicks fall off and then someone makes you eat your own dicks!!!"
---
what'd I do wrong? Blizz is biased!!!
---
imagine being as mad as you are about an imaginary warrior that's bad at the game
---
Let it out brother
---
Really its just one server partitioned into 3 servers, all with about 3.5k people on them.
---
Please inbox me and tell me howüôèüôèüôè
---
there hits a point of diminishing returns though because of how long it would take to gear more than 8-10 warriors
---
You are not. I don‚Äôt ever really care about betas for anything.
---
Bloody ashes that's a good name
---
To be fair, Ritalin Rejects would be a great band name
---
They don't
---
yes go to your local walmart and buy a copy of World Of Warcraft. Enjoy!
---
I choose death.
---
Primarily for pvp: If someone pops an invis pot (happens on occasion) it's a counter, it takes up a slot for purge/dispells, and it lets you see invisible succubi. 
---
It has some other niche uses like in DM or lets you see the ghosts above undercity.
---
I've never been able to get a Paladin passed 20 because its just so boring.
---
Gotta be a streamer. Streamers that have never streamed wow got the beta its all just a hype thing dont stress 2 months left plus who would want to play at lvl 30 only its like having sex with your clothes on
---
it was not that bad back in vanilla but the reason there will be so many now is cuz the class is insane when geared. same goes for warlocks, at least on my server there was like 5% warlocks tops.
---
It's going to depend on a lot of things, such as which phase it is, whether we even need to raid that day depending on how the week went, etc. I'm not GM of the guild so I can't answer this definitively but feel free to stop by our Discord and ask. An Officer will see it and likely give you a more straightforward answer.
---
I agree completely, I just don‚Äôt use my friends list in wow because the only people I would consider putting on my friends list are all in my guild, so that‚Äôs why I have so many in my ignore rather than my friends haha
---
Me too lol

&gt; Looked even better after degaussing.

I do enjoy me some mount collecting. I will miss it in classic.
---
Hm Friday.
---
Making a pug is a huuge amount of work in 40 man classic, reserving an item that may not even drop is hardly even sufficient compensation
---
Open portals at the entrance to AV right before it starts.
---
It gets a surprising number of people.
---
Haha nice downvote Kid. At least I am in now.
---
Could be just civil in nature right now, and no formal charges filed pursuant to criminal offense.  They can be charged up to said statue of limitations though.
---
Were you... arguing with me? Because I said the same thing, that too many Warriors means they're impossible to gear in a smooth fashion. I suggested in another comment in this thread that most guilds will have between 6 and 8 Fury Warriors, several of them replacing spots that in Vanilla might have been taken by Rogues instead. I think anything over 10 would be far too much to sustain in terms of gear curves, and even that is probably too high a number. Nevertheless, they'll be in very high demand.
---
So, Taurens are the good guys, eh?
---
If my guild raids after leveling instead of me having to join a raiding guild.  I'll run a dkp system where 1dkp is awarded per boss kill.  Items will be open bid like an auction and a loot council will prevent dumb things from happening.  No hunters with warriors 2 handers. No rogues with TFs   no warriors with perditions.  The loot council would only be there to prevent drama of someone being stupid with their dkp.     And as much as I want a TF and I play a rogue. I wont let any non-warriors have a binding.
---
And itll be done by year end
---
Or play a pserver instead of wasting money until it‚Äôs released, unless the $15/month isn‚Äôt a big deal to you.
---
&gt; As the primary off tank in a progression raiding guild my repair bills and consumable costs made sure "too much gold" was never a problem.   
---
Your guild didn't help with that? We sold shards on the AH and helped some of the plate with repair costs.
---
Wpl, it's one of the few houses standing where she's in the second floor. It's like a ruined village or whatever filled with skeletons and some other undead next to the ally fp

I feel bad for the owner of the fruit shop. Poor guy/gal was working hard for their living and now is probably homeless.
---
When did this subreddit become ok with making fun of Autistic people?
---
Not really, from what I remember. They did straight up give me the epic Dark Iron fr gear after only a few weeks though.
---
Hey, this is classic. Play whatever you think you will have fun as and do it, disregard anything else. No reason to min max this game, unless you‚Äôre into that but you even thinking about balance Druid I assume you‚Äôre not. I‚Äôm leveling as prot playin so there‚Äôs that.
---
We had people announce "interest" beforehand so we could civily discuss whether it makes sense and what people can expect in terms of bidding range. You were not allowed to bid without declaring interest.
---
Usually nobody discussed much but when a Paladin declared interest for a binding for example, it was unlikely they were allowed to bid. Or when a twohander dropped and our Warriors had significant need for it, Hunters could be excluded.
---
It's not an infallible system but you have to trust people to be somewhat reasonable, no matter what system you use.
---
I just check my 70 priest still has [gems.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/nerzhul/moonrubbage)
---
Orgrimmar gentrification.
---
Transmog and barbers moving businesses in, causing rents to rise, pushing out the local food vendors and class trainers are left without the common folk.
---
So no to barbers and transmog. Keep Orgrimmar local.
---
Plus duskwood is the best. My favorite questing experience in the entire game was the first time I ran through there with my NE Hunter.
---
Can you restore characters on beta? Genuine question, because I don‚Äôt have it :(
---
So long story short are they just temporarily dividing players on a server into 2-3 segments with the future goal of merging them eventually? Sorry just out of touch with sharding/layering
---
They've been testing it in the stress tests but those have only been a couple days long, the regular beta doesn't need it.

This is actually worth a sh*t load of money now, eBay, Amazon...etc
---
I get some guilds will treat classic seriously, but raids aren‚Äôt hard. No reason a balance Druid can‚Äôt be allowed in raids.
---
It covered food, toilet and leg stretch without getting TMI or taking more effort to convey.
---
Cut off the word Olympic, playing vanilla wow doesn't invite you to an exclusive club with the toughest competitors it's not the same thing lol
---
Ya, i don't recall ever seeing that happen on my server. If you wanted to raid you joined a guild.
---
Dwarf rogues, as well as gnome rogues, are the alliance choices for good PvP rogues. It‚Äôs really mostly about stone skin and escape artist, which are great racials. Stone skin against other rogues (blind is a poison) and warriors potentially, gnome against anything that can slow and root.
---
If you want to PvP, one of the two is a good choice, even for raiding. Human would be minmax choice for PvE. But as a dwarf you can totally do either swords or daggers and do well
---
Well, for majority of us, events are just about to start after Classic releases, not before. I don't find it anything spectacular but there were some good players attending. I don't like Tipsout guy though. He is fake and annoying.
---
Wonder if this little revelation will have negative impact on his promotion contract with Blizzard, don't really want to publicly associate with shady shit like this.
---
Hell yeah!! Me too!! 
---
You rock. Thank you so much. 
---
Can confirm, not email as well.
---
According to a Blizzard employee they have until December 31st to release the game or they are legally required to provide refunds, given how they were talking I'd assume its going to be tight.
---
Just to note that almost every profession is a gold and time sink (besides first aid which is necessary) and is better left to endgame. There are endless amounts of other things to enjoy on your way to 60 and won't leave you broke :P
---
Even rank 10 takes a fair amount of commitment at least a couple hours a day depending on if you play premades/solo. Otherwise you'll just be barely beating decay at rank 8/9.
---
PvE isnt that time consuming though if you play with a halfway decent guild, mc + bwl is a couple of hours if you dont wipe excessively.
---
IN 2004 US
---
Heres my take, as a hardcore PVPer, you spend a lot more time in the  beautiful alliance zones, killing alliance. Thus you get the best of both worlds playing horde.
---
I see.
---
Then I'd suggest mage. If you play priest, people will eventually ask you to heal. And even tho it's your 15usd/month and you can play whoever you want. It'll eventually stress you.
---
It's 2 seconds with apprentice skinning for me: https://i.imgur.com/2dMqKPc.png
---
&gt; It‚Äôs basically a catch-up thing
---
i always thought it was more of a "the game has been out for 4 months so we can see how to itemize a little better" set of gear, as opposed to being for catching up (although it obviously has that effect too)
---
You need to get your alliance to reinforce you. 
---
Back in the day we would ask for help in SW..  our level 60s would come push them away.
---
Gotta please those all furry fetishists ...
---
Resilliance is key.
---
God damn what a way to end it
---
Believe, i've tried. But when there's a dwarf with ashkandi, a priest, and a paladin all together slaughtering lowbies there isn't much you can do.
---
Sadly No I got nothing but I guess we wait.

How do I get enough resilience to not get one shot by people 40 levels higher than me?
---
Nonono, they are the canadians.
---
Just because they weren't min/maxing doesn't mean they weren't getting enchants. They were just getting the enchants they thought were affordable or best. I'm not disagreeing that enchanting might be more profitiable now with more intense players around, but as someone who was very casual and played with mostly casual players idk anyone who didn't enchant their good gear at 60.
---
Pirate servers are not like classic so you'll be fine on a real server.
---
Well this is... oversimplified. You could also call this "sharding vs. not sharding" and it would also make sense.
---
Find zones that are unpopular. They're usually unpopular because there is a lot of open space or quests are very spread out, but the extra running there is better than all the corpse running you do in the popular zones.
---
Also if you're getting camped, just find a spot that's off the beaten path somewhere with enemies that give good drops.
---
Humanoids drop cloths and money, animals drop meat and skins, spiders and scorpids drop white items for alchemy and first aid.
---
Elementals if you can find a good spot post 30 will net you Earth's and Fires that go good on the AH for Fire Res and Nature Res gear all through 60.
---
If you find yourself getting camped just go grind something for an hour and then go back to questing, if it keeps up again just go grind.
---
It sucks yes, but killing mobs over and over and gaining xp consistently if better than running back to your quest mob and having to either due again or constantly be watching over your back and not pushing your character and XP/hr.
---
Do you want to be alliance or horde? It makes a difference end game.
---
He's not talking about the in-game stat, that doesn't exist in Vanilla.
---
He's talking about your personal quality. Being resilient means getting back up, over and over and over and over again.
---
Eventually you escape the gankers or they get bored and leave. Or you log onto an alt for a few minutes, do some city shit, and then come back and they're gone.
---
Thank god. I hope that's true and it isn't as bad.
---
The company you once loved operates on financial results and not passion for gaming, it will not be the same fiscal quarter as that is borderline idiotic.
---
I agree with Jake, you just don‚Äôt get it. Community in beta is very much like vanilla. And 1,000,000 more social then retail. People who play classic while they like hc raiding pvp etc, they want it with a small community of like minded individuals (max 10k pop online consitently per server or less, as you want to get to know people. It has nothing to do with skill or anything current retail offers, which is why you won‚Äôt get it. Go get your shineys and pixels without the rpg. Enjoy your retail MMOAFG (massive multiplayer online action fantasy  game). But people wanting classic and loved vanilla are mmorpg people for the most part.
---
It's a TBC item.
---
hunter ded
---
Hey thanks for collecting these man. Is there any way you could put them on Google drive or megaupload or something as an archive? Either way appreciate you taking the time to put this together, lots of cool stuff here.
---
Resilience as in ‚Äúyou need to deal with it and be patient‚Äù resilience as a Star wasn‚Äôt introduced until TBC lol
---
Holy shit, those are some fucked up keybinds he has goin on
---
i didn't downvote you
---
Lol it was a joke but I guess I didn't make it clear.
---
Not until Wotlk as the Article states. Interestingly enough, it was definitely planned but probably scrapped due to time problems I guess, because there is a Horde Venomsour Faction in the game and I think also the NPCs for them are in Un'Goro too.
---
&gt;there's not many gold sinks like current retail.
---
Gold sinks = respec cost, raiding/pvp consumables for more hardcore players, leveling professions w/o grinding mats, twinking a char...
---
Those are just some off the top of my head. There's definitely people who wind up with more gold than they know how to spend though for sure.
---
I think WoW needs a solution for this, it really circumvents almost any anti-griefing measures the players could come up with.
---
There have been 4 assholes camping sun rock for an hour. I left to go to hillsbrad, it was still awful, so I went back to stonetalon thinking they would be gone. They aren't. They're literally still there murdering level 20s.
---
I didn‚Äôt even slightly read your response as a joke lol
---
I remember really enjoying cata heroics on release. Stonecore was rough and Grim Batol would break people.

this spec is more a pvp spec at 60 and keep in mind u will not have acces to a lot of spell damage early one, if u duo at least one of u should be melee.

I'm just gonna have to stop coming to this sub-reddit because now I'm starting to just get really pissed. Sub from Dec 2004 with 2 paying active accounts and been active for almost 14 years. Seriously man...
---
Always, unless your **pet** kills it. A killing blow is what matters and it can be against a mob or player. If your pet gets the final tick of damage they get "credit" for the kill for Drain Soul.   
---
It is common to see macros that call your pet back as you Drain Soul e.g.:    
---
     /stopattack
---
     /stopcasting
---
    /petfollow 
---
    /cast Drain Soul(Rank 1)    
---
This casts the cheaper Drain Soul with the assumption you have dots ticking.

If you have fun, is it a waste of time?
---
agreed, i'm not giving them money for BFA.
---
Huh, indeed. I never had that happened to me when playing though.  
---
I feel like that might just be an animation problem, that is maybe specific to some races, and that maybe has no impact on gameplay ?  
---
I played gnome and I always could strafe no problem (ie. not getting dazed when running away in strafe).
---
It was removed from my launcher for me sometime between Saturday and Sunday. I only had stress test access.

\----------------
---
**Prologue; the origins**
---
Inspired by the heroic actions of [**Fuel Rats**](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Fuel_Rats) group in [**Elite: Dangerous**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Dangerous), &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; exists with the sole purpose of helping others in World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
&gt;Well, what is **Fuel Rats** and what is **Elite: Dangerous**?
---
Elite Dangerous is a space-flight simulation game in which the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy (yes, literally 1:1 scale). Since the Milky Way is mind-bogglingly huge, it is not unusual for space explorers to get carried away and end up stranded somewhere in the void with no fuel. When this happens to you, your only way of getting back is if someone manages to find and reach you to transfer fuel.
---
This is where Fuel Rats come in. These are a group of volunteers who literally go above and beyond to help out their fellow players. There is no in-game system for this, mind you. So each and every member of this selfless organisation help out others through their own means. Their longest rescue mission consisted of five Fuel Rats members finding Commander "Deluvian", a stranded pilot who is 65,788 lightyears from Sol. [**The combined journey took 600 (actual) hours.**](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/18/elite-dangerous-rescue-mission-commander-deluvian/)
---
It would be an understatement to say how devoted these players are just to help out someone else.
---
Our goal is to provide a similar helpful environment in WoW: Classic. With the help of some [**Goblin Rocket Fuel**](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9061/goblin-rocket-fuel), anything is possible.
---
**Our guild ideology**
---
We have one goal; helping out any adventurers we come across. Some will come to us for help, but we should always be open to seeking out others who may be in need. Your level, equipment or the amount of wealth matters not. What matters is a healthy and friendly attitude. We do not have set roles for our members (PvE helper, PvP helper, crafter etc.) because we want you to be exemplary members of the Horde; no matter the activity. We only expect you to be kind to others, guild members and non-guildies alike.
---
As long as you wear the &lt;Goblin Rocket Fuel Rats&gt; guild tag, you should always remember that you are representing this guild with your actions. Treat others the way you'd want them to treat you; don't ninja loot, don't spam the chat, help out low level players in quests and dungeons, give them food and potions and buffs, and perhaps some 6-8 slotted bags etc.
---
**Guild Events; it's not just helping but also having fun!**
---
Helping out others is not the only reason for our existance; obviously we should be able to enjoy the game on our own as well.Such as;
---
* 5 man dungeon runs (leveling dungeons, max level dungeons)
---
* World PvP
---
* Molten Core / ZG / AQ20 / BWL / Onyxia runs should be doable with enough people. AQ40/Naxx is not on our scope.
---
* Attunement/key runs
---
* Some light Battlegrounds (when they are released)
---
* "Fuel Runs" where we go out to the wild and help random players
---
**Epilogue; closing thoughts**
---
A little background on myself; I've played WoW almost religiously starting from final stages of Vanilla all throughout Wotlk and beginning of MoP. I did almost everything aside from AQ40/Naxx and PvP ranking. Much like many returning players, this time around I'm too old/busy to have a similar playstyle. Instead I just want to kick back with some friends, and enjoy mainly the social aspect of WoW. I will most likely be tanking 5-mans and offering free food/portals/enchant services on a mage alt as well.
---
The reason I wanted to start this guild is to provide a friendly environment. If I can make one person happy, that's a good day for me. I'm also starting this guild on (Oceanic) PvP server so with some luck I can take revenge on that level 55 gnome rogue who is harrassing those poor level 30's.
---
Feel free to contact me on here via a PM, or on Discord. I feel like I'm a bit old for Discord, but that seems to be the #1 tool to gather players (and also a great upgrade to Ventrillo) so we have a bare-bones server as well.
---
I will update this post as I get more time on my hands with additional information such as member count, raiding times (when applicable) etc. For now, think of us as a mainly helping social guild that does extra activities as well!
---
Thanks for your time.
---
It's hot drop o'clock! I made bank pretty good last expansion by what I learned playing the markets in Eve Online. Now I'm space rich enough I don't even rat or mine anymore.
---
I think the luck and all the random and outside factors and interferences made it way more interesting.
---
NA2004 account here as well but nothing. Very disappointed for me but super happy for everyone that got in. Cheers!
---
The idea is to allow for people to be able to login and play for launch, but when people quit and/or don‚Äôt like classic, they won‚Äôt have to combine servers, like they have had to.
---
Oh yeah. One more thing. Warlock PvP trinket doesn't remove stun. Just so you know.
---
I got beta right after I resubbed lol
---
Having like 28 people streaming out of a 30 man bracket also makes that difficult
---
There's a total of 8 allied races currently playable, Horde and Alliance combined.
---
Weird way to spell shaman waterwalking + epic mount.
---
Quin69 lost a duel and said hed delete his Ret paladin, and deleted it right as he logged off for the night. The next day he was playing it again.
---
Esfand heard of this, and then deleted his Paladin and restored it instantly for bait clickbait content
---
That's just the plural "you"
---
I'd guess there will be a huge surplus of warriors but not the useful kind. Tbey aren't too bas to level so they'll get played a ton.
---
is obvious.
---
Was there a video of a gnome mage create a portal and tell people to click on it to summon?
---
There will be plenty. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. You can wreck people with a healer in PVP and top tier DPS. Hard not to like that combo.
---
Man I find this fascinating. My guild farmed fire resist, got buffs from the mob outside of bwl and still got wrecked in MC from fire damage in Vanilla. I remember getting outright annihilated sometimes on trash packs.
---
lol relax dude, your experiences aren't the same as everyone else's on this forum
---
And when those layers get removed by phase 2, 10 hour queues or free transfers to dead servers! Wooohooooooo!
---
Is there a button like on retail or do you have to contact a GM?
---
**It is actually a thing.** 
---
But please note: as a ~~battle mage~~ thunder chicken, you have to make use of that high armor/sustain/survivability. Do not just spam your spells. You should be mostly melee'ing (with Moonfire up) to proc Omen of Clarity for free spells (usually Regrowth or HT for sustain). 
---
Roots are your friend as well, as they are a dot and let you swing--kite away--and go back in when your swing timer is up (same kind of thing as tremor totem and hamstring kiting). You want a slow 2-hand mace or staff with high top-end damage.
---
You dont need the launcher for any other games, I doubt this will be different.
---

As stated above you should be fine if you raid some early on and zg ones it comes. One thing to remember you are not in premades just for burst you are there for healing, totems, purge, slows, and ok burst. If you don't enjoy and want to play the Jack of all trades play style you might want another class
---
Sure. But healer pally might not be as much fun. 
---
With all the talk ive been hearing of people saying that classic is alot easier than expected. There is even more reason why non-optimized specs can work. 
---
Remember, the game is about having fun. And since there is alot more options than people expected (due to lower difficulty than expected) there will be more wacky builds and more poeple having fun.
---
I meant % move speed my bad. 
---
You get ghost wolf at level 20 i think and cheetah is ya at 30. 
---
But the move speed bonus is 40% increase i think.
---
/squelch
---
Were you a high feedback contributor for any beta for Blizzard games before?
---
Just curious what your plan is for the quintessence? You plan on getting enough people to 60 week 1 to farm the quests and rep, then Week 2 killing the bosses, or are you just gonna farm trash at the entrance to get rep before you kill Lucifron? Not sure how it all works out
---
This solely exists because time investment is required for reward and people don't want to squander it. In retail you can just step on that person's neck and be into another group in the click of a button. In Vanilla? Finding that other group might not even happen that night, let alone reclearing the entire dungeon.
---
Cool thanks for letting me know. I see a new beta wave went out, but I‚Äôm at work. Hopefully!!
---
Well not physically, lol, but mentally, maybe.
---
not if it's opened
---
This is kind of a shit post... This doesn't even articulate it properly...
---
I was in both and nothing for me. Hmm Strange. Whatevers I can wait until the 27th of August.
---
I see it‚Äôs lowest cost at $150, and that is an opened set. Still a lot of money.
---
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=wow+classic+talents+vs+vanilla+talnets
---
I did google it. I dont see anyone talking about how the old 1.12 vanilla talents are different than the 1.12 classic talents. 
---
All I am seeing is people talking aobut pre 1.12 talent changes. and that we should have 1.9 talent system or something.(something im apathetic to)
---
Now that is a very very good point
---
Alliance because ironforge is the best
---
Or both :D
---
I mean there's no right or wrong answer, to any class or profession, you gotta play the game how you want to play it and do what you want to do.
---
LW can make mail so you can't go wrong there, and every class can benefit from every profession from gear being made, to enchants, to selling bags
---
Nope, most of the tick manipulation stuff in runescape was discovered after OSRS launched. Most of the tricks are just animation cancels though, and WoW doesn't really have anything like that, so I doubt anything will be found with batching. 
---
Imagine if you canceled out of your auto-attack timer every time started crafting, and therefore could do a rotation of attack - craft - attack - craft - etc. to hit on every second spell batch ‚Äî that's basically how runescape tick manipulation works.
---
There was griefing in classic. #NOCHANGES
---
Yeah and not everyone times themselves when they run 100 meters. My point is that some people like to do things the best they can.
---
I like to challenge and test myself while pursuing my hobbies. Just because what you‚Äôre doing isn‚Äôt that hard doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt take enjoyment from maximizing your performance.

---
Do you want to play alliance or horde?
---
I wonder if ones with keys are actually selling at all at the prices people have them up for.
---
The level 30 game looks interesting because of the extremes they've taken it to. Wouldn't want to do it forever but I'm sad I'll get to do it never.
---
It would be great if it was like those cringe videos you watch at orientation at a new job.

Doh, I don‚Äôt have the stress test option on my launcher anymoreüò≠.
---
Listen casters. I know you hate us hunters. But please understand that especially early game, intellect and spirit are very valuable stats for us hunters. You know that Emberstone Staff from deadmines? That is arguably better than Cruel Barb for us. Intellect is basically our source of damage. The more arcane and multishots we can spam, the more damage we deal. The Emberstone Staff also has a very high DPS rating on it, which we will be putting to use when we catch aggro from our pets. Please do not hate us for rolling on genuine upgrades. Not all intellect is an upgrade. You won't see us rolling on cloth gear and stacking pure intellect. But some intellect is better than the alternative agility options. 
---
Stat priorities for hunters (not including stamina) are Agility &gt; AP &gt; Intellect &gt; Spirit = Strength
---
Agility and Intellect both provide a damage boost to us. Agility moreso than intellect, but a hunter without intellect will be very inefficient due to mana issues. Once again, sorry we need the same gear, but don't hate us for rolling on certain pieces that are just really good for us, even though they are good for you as well.
---
Warrior isn‚Äôt really tough to level in 1.12
---
Is.... is that not how we are supposed to do it?
---
Yea, the tooltip alone pretty much says what it's used for, but keep in mind each class has cookie cutter specs for PvP and PvE, just because there's 1 million options, don't expect them to all be viable unless you are wanting to be at a disadvantage (which is fine because most of those silly builds CAN be niche and effective for certain situations)
---
My server had regular pugs of MC / BWL / Onyxia and ZG.  I assume AQ20 as well but don't think I ever did one.
---
I suggest you find a more casual raiding guild though with times that work for you.  The experience would probably be much better than always pugging.
---
Thanks! I'll work hard to have it done before Classic launches :)
---

Watched the first episode and thought it was pretty good, second one started a little slow, does it get better ?

Hell yea dude horde troll shaman &lt;Old school&gt; here
---
&gt; WoW is about the journey man.
---
A game "about the journey" in which players obsess over getting to 60 as fast as possible, hmmm...
---
i still think it would be better.
---
they could maybe get away with it once, but after that it'd be kill on sight.  Also, they couldn't just use a lvl 1, they'd have to risk their reputation on a character they actually put time and effort into.
---
There's no perfect solution, but the way they had it they were completely inable to do anything about that one guy.

I would like to subscribe to your youtube channel.

Everything checks out as expected boys.
---
There are plenty of basic guides out there, but I can give you a few pointers:
---
At level 21, you're extremely weak - even more so if you're not using 2 Handers. Your only offensive options are Heroic Strike - which is not efficient damage per rage at all - and Overpower, which is *if* you're utilizing a 2 hander. Unfortunately, Warriors just do not generate enough rage at that level due to gear to pose any sort of meaningful threat to other melee classes, especially when those can control you (Rogues) or outlast you (Paladins, Shamans). These problems are made a lot worse if you're fighting ranged classes, in which case you basically can't win. 
---
Things do get better at 30 though when you get Intercept, then again at 34 and 36 (Whirlwind, Pummel). But for you to be truly effective in PvP, I'd recommend going Arms with a 2 hander - with the added bonus that it'll be easier to level with (although since you're on a private server, abusing /sit with Enrage is probably better).
---
DW/Fury tanking was still a thing in Vanilla, just less common on difficult bosses. 
---
Example from Patch 1.9:
---
https://youtu.be/Ql-KCBkVOSI
---
I think the only use for Mace specialization is in a PvP build that picks up Blade Flurry, Prep, and Hemo.  
---
You get a lot of neat stuff with the build, faster cooldown evasion, sprint, vanish, and blind, prep, improved kick, sprint that breaks roots/snares, and hemo w/ mace spec. 
---
Particularly good with a 2.7 or 2.8 speed mace.
---
Soul shard farming isn't as bad as some ppl make it seem
---
What?
---
Not all players just the ones that don‚Äôt care about the journey. Which during vanilla were the minority. During classic... who knows.
---
\&gt;Fuck this one guy having fun
---
You do realize he was ruining the fun of tens of thousands of other people, right?
---
Going Spriest with my holy pala partner, just casual so not rly  min/maxing
---
Tripled?
---
That‚Äôs exactly what the layers and meant to prevent.
---
Paladins can heal and mana regens during combat which puts them leagues ahead of Rogues/Warriors, not to mention they get three buffs almost right out of the door.
---
But I agree, leveling a Warrior isn't really that hard either. I would actually argue Rogue is harder.
---
i hope it aint i think its badass some more people get a chance to enjoy classic
---
 Not sure if this has been reported, but City Bosses are definitely not working as they did in vanilla. Asmongold kited Teremus to the Stormwind Keep and Bolvar did nothing. In vanilla he would attack hostile mobs. Proof below.

---
I‚Äôm only hoping cause I‚Äôm not in it lol.
---
aug 13th for server choice and name reservation
---
You‚Äôre stressing about the wrong questions my man.
---
When classic releases your priority should be:
---
1,) pick a sever name/style you like which boils down to pick PVE if you hate world PvP/ganking.
---
2.) Pick a class you like, if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôll like, try a few until you find something you love. General rule of thumb is level 15-30 will give you a pretty good flavor for what you‚Äôre in for. 
---
3,) there are best in slot lists, guides all over for your class,  rotations, etc. I would suggest staying away from these beyond researching which stats your class needs. (Strength and a slow weapon for a warrior for example) 
---
4.) as far as guilds go, pretty much all the hard core ones will be forming now, all the ones I‚Äôll want to be a apart of will be forming when the game gets released. I plan to just meet some cool people in game and join up with people I meet organically. Wouldn‚Äôt stress about that unless you want to push top 5%/server firsts.
---
Any idea how the tiger mount from ZG will work then?
---
And people believe then when they say it will be removed in a few weeks after launch üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes. I've always reported bugs in all betas I've been in before and looking back at my e-mails, I've had access to all xpac betas. I've also seen people on here saying they got beta access and have never even played on a PTR before. RNG screwing irl just like it does in-game :(
---
Warriors were not that hard.  It was slow and all you had was HS until you reach 30.  But once you picked up MS and you do your class quest to pick up your OP leveling 2 hander, you were good to go.  30-60 was pretty smooth sailing.
---
As for demand: 5 mans always waited for a warrior tank.  Druids and paladins couldn't well in vanilla so it was pretty much warrior or bust for 5 mans.  No one wanted dps warrior though for 5 manning stuffing.  For raids, this was trickier.  There were slots available, but with so many warriors running around, it was hard back then to really find a way onto a solid raiding guild as a warrior.  I mained a priest for a AQ40 guild and I had a warrior alt.  I tried for the longest time looking for a guild to raid with.  But they never worked out.  And my main guild would never allow me to raid with my warrior alts, not even for those quick farming runs after we were most dudes were come with MC gear.
---
For other classes, healers obvously are always in demand.  For DPS,  warlocks and mages were in demand as well.  Warlock in raids though were invaluable.  Soul stones, health stones, imp buff, banish, fear locking when applicable, and even shadow tanking on a few occasions as well.  Plus, their dps was second only to fury warrior and super geared rogues.  You could never have enough warlocks really.
---
Lusting?  How does that have to do with anything we‚Äôre (I‚Äôm) talking about.  You‚Äôre reaching for anything you can find to put me down.
---
Maybe you also want his home address and ss number? That‚Äôs so stupid dude griefing is part of vanilla get over it, or ask blizzard to make streamer realm for them to feel special in
---
There was a pig Ony run on my server in Vanilla where the leader (a rogue) ninja'ed all the loot. A thread was made on the forums and the dude was blacklisted from all the various pug channels on my server and even guild kicked immediately. Reputation on your server was huge in Vanilla so ninja looting was a costly endeavour.
---
beta is boring now anyway sorry lad
---
Yea the general negativity people have about it can get old. I've been told that it is "impossible" to do things/tank fights with feral druid that I have personally done. 
---
The most vocal outcry comes from people who are wannabe hardcore. The actualy hardcore crowd looks at the numbers, and doesn't have time to get caught up in stigma. They see the results, so they bring what they need. The casuals don't give a fuck as long as you are showing up to raid on time. Its the guys who *think* theyre hardcore but aren't actually anything special that stick to the meta dogmatically, often times without understanding why. 
---
&gt; I just want to be an asset.
---
As a druid you will be needed, no matter what spec you go (except boomkin lol). Innervate and brez and huge, and to be honest druid is a better healer than it gets credit for too. The keyboard warriors say raids only take 2 restos, because thats the meta for hardcore speedrunners. But:
---
 1. Brez gets better the more your raid fucks up. The hardcore crowd doesnt really need it because they don't fuck up and die as much. Most non-crazy-hardcore raids can make good use out of 4-5 restos depending on the raid. I would probably run 3-4 core restos if I were in charge of a raid comp.
---
2. 99.9999% of guilds (basically everyone but Dreamstate/APES) will take whatever healers they can get, and kiss your fucking feet just for showing up. They don't have the luxury of being picky most of the time. ]
---
&gt; I think at 60 I'd like to heal or tank, as I doubt I have the ability currently to pull top DPS in cat form. However I'd like to keep some of the variability the class has at 60 so I can go out and pvp, grind mobs for money, etc. 
---
HotW spec will get that done for you, but it kind of runs into a problem while raiding: you usually bring exactly the number of healers you need, any more is a waste. That means that for you to tank a fight, the raid loses one of its healers, which is not usually worth it. Feral tanks typically go dps when not bear forming it up, which means the raid brings a different dedicated healer in that slot, and doesn't lose out on much when they need to bring you in as a tank. 
---
That being said if you can find a group that can fit you in its slots, that spec will tank raids, heal at a raid tier well enough to get by, and be medium-decent and solo killing mobs out on its own.
---
One last thing to add, you can actually get by kinda okay fully resto specced in cat gear for solo grinding mobs, depending on what your'e doing. Most of your power comes from your form and your gear, so while you wont be doing as much dps as a feral druid, you can definitely get the job done as deep resto.
---
Vulpera are purely a rumor. There's a whole fan base dedicated to begging Blizzard for the Vulpera called "Vulpera Hype Caravan" and tbh they convinced me I want one too now, they lure you like cultists!
---
To be fair they have a cool vibe as nomad scavengers
---
I mowed lawns and did chores to get the money for UO during the summer before it came out and before I hit 6th grade. Still tears at me how much I loved that game and EQ. I definitely had the UO posters and EQ expansion maps hung up in my room over any athletes.
---
And you‚Äôre sure you have the Classic Beta opt-in selected and saved? When I went back to the page a couple days later, it had turned itself back off.

That‚Äôs great info. Warriors sound even more cool now. Thanks!

Making PUGs in Vanilla didn't really require much effort, especially if you ran them regularly and people knew it would succeed.

I didn't get invited to any of the stress tests or the beta... absolute shaft

I would love to talk with you about commissioning a drawing of my soon to be main in classic!  Please, if you‚Äôre open to do one let me know. I‚Äôd like one of a female Tauren Druid in the tier 2 set, either just the character or in some Druidic scenery. Love your UD piece!
---
For Priest Wand is the way of life when lvling
---
Could anyone summarize what happened phrasing it in a way that isn‚Äôt just one huge confusing run-on sentence?
---
Yeah but Druid bear tanks had 16k+ health and crazy armor and dodge so could eat crushing blows.
---
I always preferred the bear tanks to the warrior tanks just because they out performed the warriors in TPS and allowed us to DPS harder and were better AoE tanks when it was needed.
---
Both are good tanks, but I think warriors are overrated and too many people back then just sucked at them and the one great Druid bear tank I knew set an impression on me.
---
The test server is on my launcher but can only see the stress realm rip
---
I bought the first one a while back but I havent been able to find it since our most recent move :( Cant believe 2 more have already came out. I got some catching up to do!
---
What if we all buy from her so her shop can flourish
---
Ha! I'd probably go this route too with a single key bind but I'd have to use mount as one of then...just seems appropriate to me. 
---
And if I was a rogue kick would be the other required ability for me.
---
Struck a nerve must have hit the nail on the head. Truly you are a winner lmao.
---
Anyone able to provide a source re his income? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a lot but would be surprised if this is accurate.
---
I noticed none of the players are gnomes. Hmm
---
"Hinder" by not having 5% chance to get one extra swing?
---
I swear, this community has the biggest hard-ons for the lowest of bonuses sometimes
---
Problem incel? Time to buy some high quality rope.
---
If those arrows in the layered section are meant to signify that they occupy the same place but cannot see each other, then they should be in every sharded region too. It's not as if sharding means every region is its own harmonious server.
---
I think it was useless - you aren't doing good enough DPS and you're just better off with a shield or 2H. DW is one of those things that probably isn't viable until WoTLK or whatever.
---
Not that it's a bad thing. I like from one side how each class has one specific role and everything else is "just there". But I have a friend who makes a fairly decent point how WoTLK is better (for him) than Vanilla, because there are different ways to play a class. But he also overlooks the fact that around WoTLK class balancing has gotten to the point where all classes feel almost identical and their identity is lost.
---
Yeah fair enough, i don't mind then just throwing heals down in dungeons - but having to acquire maintain and update a second set for healing, while only being maybe 70% as good or also being needed to respec, is a little too much of a price to pay for being awesome in pvp.
---
Ideal is actually mastering both. Unless you're the GM or friends with them, MT is usually taken, differentiating yourself as a strong fury / OT is key.
---
Reserving anything lower than legendary is unnecessary, and a gross overvaluation of the requirements to organize and lead a PUG.  Having rules for main spec and off spec is a given, but manipulating a raid to guarantee an item is telling of an individuals character.  Unless it is a guild hosted PUG, and even then that basically shouts "we aren't competent enough to find 40 of our own".
---
Sounds like the pain is worth it in the end. Thanks!!
---
Lol, so irrelevant.  All you want to do is feel good about yourself. You don‚Äôt give a shit if you‚Äôre right or wrong in what you say.  Such a low life.
---
Its crouch and sprint for shooters
---
Yeah, Scholomance is a bakery
---
That's a pretty big clarification.    
---
More like "our original post was wrong, it was 9% all along." Glad they went back and caught this/updated us. It could have caused problems if people were hit capped at 8% and still missing.
---

This is unfortunately. Thought I could enjoy some bfa but the pvp and over is so trash
---
No, you‚Äôre done! REEEEEE
---
I‚Äôll keep that advice in mind for sure! Thanks!!
---
No worries you‚Äôll learn too... eventually... I hope
---
Heck, their entire prophecy revolved around the Hour of Twilight, which happened during Cataclysm. Though the fanatical cultists believe that was false and the TRUE Hour is nearly upon us.
---
Darn cults
---
Strange, I've played both sides as well and horde seem to be ganking while level 60 24/7 in like 2/3 zones on every server.
---
Only further confirms their preference to the earliest players, which is by all means the better way to go speaking as somebody with a 2006/2007/2009 account with subs in their family. Some people with later accounts have got in but not the norm. 
---
To those annoyed though - really only a fraction of a fraction of early players are getting in. There are millions like you, and the servers seem to only have what 2-3k players? Never expect it, or you'll just be very disappointed. they made it clear it's a small beta.
---
&gt;do hardcore pvp guilds take shadow priests in bgs?
---
No.
---
&gt;Should I respec to healer every time I want to raid?
---
If the raid is already on farm, no. If you're progression raiding, yes. Pretty much every healing class can raid as their PvP spec once content is already on farm. It's not a big deal at all as long as raids go off without a hitch.
---
So a Human using Swords or Maces and an Orc using Axes aginst a raid boss has:
---
* plus 3.5% to-hit
---
* plus 0.2% to-crit
---
* plus 20% damage on glancing blows (40% of all white attacks)
---
* minus 0.5% to-be-dodged
---
* minus 0.5% to-be-blocked
---
* minus 8.0% to-be-parried
---
Damn, that's a lot.
---
So you just want single servers with 3.5k limits
---
My only point is people claiming it to be against the ToS for harrasment or whatever when everyone there was breaking ToS. Not that you have the mental capacity to understand something like that.

Geeks will always, always, get got by the simplest of schemes.

I mean it literally was. Archbishop Benedictus is the Twilight Father
---
It makes doing his quests very awkward
---
I do hope there are some fine lads that will list all the Streamer servers so we (I) can avoid them like the plague
---
And considering Rogues almost have to use swords in raid contexts, damn, go human or go home I guess...
---
It's supposed to go away when phase 2 is released.
---
Eve Online.
---
No because it won‚Äôt look that good
---
Damn these pics are like 10 pixels each
---
Yeah hurricane is the way to go, even for Feral druids.
---
The point is they've never done something like that in Vanilla and shouldn't now. Not to mention the same people complaining about it do the same shit, on a smaller scale.
---
It's time and effort, and a payment is more than reasonable.
---
With what we know now, Druids aren't just slightly inferior tanks, they're damn right awful tanks compared to Warriors.
---
&gt; (and Arms as well in Horde guilds with Windfury weaving)
---
You don't do arms. You just do a 2h fury spec.
---
Leaked 15 years in advance!
---
After reading these replies at how much fury warrior spam there will be, it would be so amusing to see Blizzard nerf their damage output a little to be in line with other classes.
---
The salt would sustain me for a year
---
Pick horse dude, alliance are all pricks they will watch you die just to steal your kill they are all pricks they literally only kill low levels and camp them and they only attack the same level players if they have several backup m8s
---
MY CABBAGES!
---
If you wanna know who has more stuff to do, I feel like the Alliance had a small amount of favouratism in Classic.
---
Alliance has 7 more mounts than the Horde.
---
They have 2 more rep factions, around 100 more quests and 4 more faction specific territories.
---
That's all I've found for now, but it's really interesting to see how the Alliance presumeably has more content than the Horde.
---
Is there a way to make it fallback to your current target?  So you can use the same hotkey?
---
I mean, the resolution of the pictures themselves are 210x165, and from 2002.
---
&gt; If asmongold's mom can do it in vanilla, you can do it in classic.
---
So true.
---
What? I was saying it‚Äôs I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs in Boralus and you cannot get on a toon other than 120(account bound and can send to alt‚Äôs)
---
Holy shit you can travel form in the flag room?
---
hacked bro
---
Yeah it feels good, wanna know why? Because tomorrow you're gonna buy some rope and put it to great use.
---
Hogger server!
---
Damn this is good info, I never even suspected this, it goes a long way to explain the years of confusion about where the cap actually sat. It reassures me to see that theres parts of the code that even they didn't realise were there, because that means suggests they're directly porting it rather than just trying to reverse engineer it. We need to do our best to find more of these.
---
So, on to what this means - I'm inferring that 304-305 will be a hard ledge in terms of power. People over it don't have to worry about the extra 1% hit, people under it do. One thing I'm confused about, does this affect the 0.4% hit chance you get per level of weapon skill 301-305 according to this algorithm
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10 then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, then the formula for calculating your base miss chance against that mob is: 6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10)*.4%
---
or is it simply another calculation on top, and therefore an even GREATER benefit for racial weaponskill?
---
Nice copy pasta
---
I still think the jury is out on whether swords will always beat daggers in every tier of progression, at least on Horde side. There are too many factors in play to figure it out without a lot of math no one has done in a while (and those were all guessed numbers apparently).
---
But it does make the Aged Core Leather Gloves from MC best-in-slot for the entire game. Which means the Bonescythe Waistguard is now best-in-slot so you can still have the 8-piece set bonus.
---
Are you on a blizzard employees F&amp;F list??
---
Well bosses are still going to die at the end of the day. Look at APES for example, they went for a full PvP racial roster and still got realm first KT.
---
If you want to min/max and be #1 on parses, yeah you should probably consider human if you're a rogue or warrior player. If you're a PvPer, maybe not. It really is not the end of the world.
---
&gt; go human or go horde I guess...
---
Doesnt look like it, someone else also posted this.
---
But aren't we the aliens?
---
# FRUIT VENDOR!
---
Here for history.
---
I subbed on two accounts and didn‚Äôt get it. Ha
---
Even if I got one, I want to wait til the game launces. That shit can't come soon enough either. All these other games I'm playing are filled with fuck boys who take the shit way to serious and make it not fun.
---
Even if you provided proof that you were him, literally no one cares. You got your two seconds of fame congrats
---
Think of what your goals for the game are, and base your decision off of that.
---
Yeah, that also works. But Warriors in general are so good that a good-yet-not-cutting-edge Horde guild won't likely mind an Arms spec so long as they aren't polluting the debuff pool. They might not be "the best spec", but they'll be more than adequate.
---
YEAH!  I‚Äôm gonna say have zero ability to participate in anything meaningful.
---
Trolling isn‚Äôt arguing
---
Welcome to Toxic!
---
We are a North America based guild playing on Alliance. We will roll on a PVP server when they announced names.‚Äã
---
We are a semi-hardcore (we will lean more hardcore towards the start) U.S. raiding guild and have been playing together since April of 2015. We have raided mainly Vanilla content, but have delved into TBC and WOTLK as well. We run a 9 Hour raid week. Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Mondays are the focus of our main group. Before enough content is available, or enough alts to do more than one raid, raid times will be used for focus farming or remaining dungeon gearing. We look forward to having a stronger PVP presence in Classic compared to our Past. We look at skill, attitude, and gear/dedication to character in that order. We do not carry dead weight or people who clash with the guild.
---
While we take the game and the experience very seriously, we are realistic about our capabilities. The majority of us are in our late 20‚Äôs to early 30‚Äôs, maintain a full time job, and take care for our families. Wow has been a cornerstone in many of our lives for the past 14 years. While we are always pushing to do the new content, we do not leave our friends behind. The best part of wow that we all cling to over the many years we played is friendship and the relationships we make along the way. We are a gaming community with Wow being the focus of all of us!
---
Here at Toxic, we hope to bring a different type of guild from most. We want to be tight-knit, supportive of each other, not afraid to point our friends to become better; we encourage friendly competition; we look for members going out of their way to assist; we want to be that old school fun guild that doesn't feel like a job, but rather a community of friends who want to kick a little ass! I will put a lot of effort into bringing very popular posts and guides into a central location on our website ([http://toxicgaming.us/](http://toxicgaming.us/)) to allow for your focus to be on the game, rather than trying to research how to best play your class, or where to go to level a profession.
---
Our Leadership:
---
Our leadership has experience leading in all retail walks of life up: from Vanilla up to and including the Draenor expansion. The guild leaders, Pronator &amp; Michaelfox, have been around since the game was first released in 2004. They have experienced all end game raids during their prime.
---
Loot System:
---
Loot Council- The Loot Council will be made up of class leaders, and a random rotation of regular raid members. We will do a prioritized loot system where we are distributing the loot in the most fair way possible, based on BIS and class needs. We plan on putting a ton of effort into ensuring the right gear gets in the right players hands. We have always prided ourselves in being completely transparent with all decisions and encourage all to talk through all loot (outside of when we are raiding of course).
---
Main Raid Times:
---
We raid from 10 p.m. till 1 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (7 p.m. till 10 p.m. PST). Currently, the days we raid are Wednesday , Thursday , and Monday. Raiders are expected to be online an hour or so before raid for raid buffs and to pull on time.
---
We plan on going for every world boss that we can unless it is at an extremely unoptimal time.
---
We plan on doing a secondary raid group on weekends, strong alt characters or members who cannot make the primary raid time will make up the majority of this raid group. We will treat this raid just as serious as the primary raid.
---
Our Goals:
---
Our main goal for the Toxic guild is to progress as far as possible quickly (but enjoying the content as well) and also competing with other fellow guilds for progression.
---
Our Expectations:
---
We expect players to be the best they can be, always! This means you should know your class in and out (doing proper research from credible sources). You should have all the addons, macros, and keybindings your class needs in order to be the best. Don't be a clicker, no one likes a clicker.
---
What about PVP:
---
While &lt;Toxic&gt; is mainly focused on the PVE side of the game, PVP will also be organized and encouraged. There are quite a few BIS or easily obtainable PVP items for PVE raiding. We will be coordinating guild pre-made battlegrounds and other fun events!
---
Why Toxic?:
---
We are unlike any other guild. We take time to try to mold our entire team as a cohesive unit. We have done many super fun RP Events including Halloween in the Crypts of Karazhan, Christmas &amp; New Year's parties. We have celebrated unique birthdays as a guild and many other strange but incredible events. We are all in when we set our minds to something. Our player base in our 40 man bolstered an unprecedented 25+ of our team having a 90%+ lifetime attendance to raids (100+ raids). Don‚Äôt ask Why, ask Why not!!!\`
---
Our Current High Recruitment needs are:
---
Warlock, Resto Druid, Dwarf Holy Priest
---
People who play on Off hours/weekends, or dont always want to raid are more than welcome to join as well, we want to always have something going on. We will accept any role interested in our non primary raid times currently, as well as anyone who is just looking for a home for classic.
---
Look up Pronator on Youtube for some of our older raids, and guild meetings to get a feel for us.

---
Yeah, do you know not what that words means ‚Äúpedantic‚Äîasshole‚Äù?
---
They weren't wrong though, according to what I understood of the post. The base hit cap fluctutates depending on your weapon skill, something i'd never heard of til now.
---
I'm in the same boat. I think it'd be cool to do, and I'll help the gold if they go for it, but it's very low on my priority list.
---
I don't know wtf you just said, but it was awesome
---
None
---
Normal Realm - Play Alliance
---
PvP Realm - Play Horde
---
Wait, fucking what
---
-hardcore raids
---
-classic
---
Hold on there lmao.
---
I'm sure there will be be plenty of updated versions of add-ons for classic. Carbonite was pretty popular back then so hopefully it's going to be back.
---
Who are you
---
If people didn't care I wouldn't be making this post
---
I guess I did not know about it. I picked up a Robe  of the Winter Night from AH.
---
How do you figure that?
---
Jesus Christ this blog, just give me the recipe!
---
Don't worry, it's just an incredibly loud, small group of people. No one important cares. You're good.
---
Warriors and rogues collecting bis probably already have it.
---
I hope so too but iirc it died in mop with the banning of all the "Pay for premium versions of the addons". The source is available online though, but it doesnt look like its been updated in a long time.
---
&gt;minus 8.0% to-be-parried
---
I've not heard of this, where is this coming from? Last I heard weapon skill had the same reduction on your target's parries as their dodge and blocks. 8% would be ludicrous.
---
Sent you a DM : )
---
Quoting u/Ixliam on cloth 
---
&gt; I think in the long run the stun resist will be better. I know myself while I thought undead was cool to play, I ended up getting tired of having all the armor looking ratty and torn, and my bones/backbone sticking thru. Ended up switching to orc and just liked the overall aesthetic of it better. But really its up to you. 
---
He kinda makes a good point.
---
Definitely checked.
---
The real problem is male or female?    Sexy tauren or sexy night elf.
---
 Insanity. I've never seen those before, and I've done so much research it's crazy. What website/process did you use to find them?
---
So what‚Äôs the lowdown on disc then? They are good in rbgs but anything else? I think I saw there is usually one shadow weaving disc in raids and the rest are holy? Sounds like sadly there‚Äôs no way to do it all as shadow/disc and you pretty much have to go holy if you don‚Äôt want to respec all the time.
---
I mean, the majority of spell animation changes just fix the spells to what they should look like. Its a shame. I really really enjoy retail spell animations, the majority of them
---
I used to walk around in low level contested areas as a rogue in stealth with a white rabbit out as a pet. People would often come over and check out the rabbit since it seemed to be a bit of an anomaly, and then I‚Äôd sap ‚Äòem, lmao.
---
Have a friend who works at blizzard that put me on the list. I got in at noon today as well.
---
Jokes on them ive been subbed for 15 years
---
Transmog is the Walmart of wow.
---
He has 18k subs. That alone is $540,000. Plus donations, plus YouTube, plus any other way streamers typically monetize like merch or sponsorships (though I don‚Äôt know specifically if he has done either of these).
---
Gotta show support to small indie companies.

---
To clarify, most pservers have been using 9% to hit. There have already been many calculations that take this into consideration. I believe it still comes out to approximately 2% more damage *with all BiS raid gear considered!* (i.e., orcs use axes, other races use weapons such as maladath/LHC to make up for it).
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but I figured it was always 9%. I started playing and subsequently started raiding in TBC, where the hit cap was 9%. I didn't think it would be any different for Vanilla/Classic; you're still 3 levels below the boss whether you're 60 or 70.
---
Now you‚Äôre acting Vanilla!
---
Get improved "eyes of the beast", dash and prowl on your cat pet. Send it into a opposing town and cause havoc while you are safely hidden some decent distance away. Usually you can waste a heap of peoples time as they will be trying to find and kill you since they think you must be close by. But an extra minute on the eyes plus the dash means you can be a serious distance apart.
---
30/21 can do everything in the game
---
Druids tank 5 mans and most raid bosses in vanilla fine.
---
To clarify, pservers have used the 9% hit value and only resulted in approximately 2% damage increase with all BiS raid items considered (such as maladath or LHC). However, pservers were abysmally wrong when it came to parry numbers! I believe pservers were running parry equal to dodge which was approx 5.8% or something. The true value is 14% to parry. 
---
Therefore, this could be a pretty huge change.
---
i was probably going to roll a rogue or druid, predominantly rogue but i‚Äôm not entirely sure now. everything‚Äôs up in the air and as a new players it‚Äôs kinda hard to choose.
---
most likely gonna roll rogue as the whole sneak and nuke someone really clicks with me.
---
also, thanks for all the answers :)
---
And the trash!
---
Do dungeons scale like raids or?
---
Alexensual's discord getting purged? I like that one.
---
You stand behind bosses. They don‚Äôt block or parry via the ass
---
THOSE BINDS THO
---
their forums  [https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=116](https://www.wowinterface.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=116)
---
Apparently, yes.
---
An attacker with 300/300 skill has a 6.5% chance for their attacks to be parried versus a level 60 mob with 300/300 defense skill. A level 63 mob has 315 skill, so therefore gains 8% additional chance to parry versus 300/300 skill.
---
It doesn't matter for melee DPS, only for the tank since attacks made from behind cannot be parried. If it wasn't like that the tank would evaporate from all the parry haste.
---
You bet! If you plan to raid, druids are generally expected to heal. Though I‚Äôve heard feral can do competitive dps with some extra leg work. Just takes extra effort compared to rogue.
---
Did you want some general pointers on those two classes?

It's probably more, he makes a lot of fucking money, dude...
---
&gt; If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10, your base parry rate is: 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) * 0.1%.
---
This we knew from extensive testing.
---
&gt; If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, your base parry rate will be much higher. Exact figures are not known, but base parry rates of Boss mobs are estimated to be between 10-15%, and may vary from one Boss to the next.
---
This we didn‚Äôt. With Classic, Blizzard confirmed it‚Äôs 14%.
---
imo level 60's and gear on the shop too
---
i‚Äôd appreciate some points on rogue, that would be cool :))
---
Same and I still didn't get invited
---
Yup. Blizz/Activision is trying to get me to buy a max level character token with mount and gear included and all I can do is shake my head at how badly blizz has messed up their game. It feels bad re-buying the game but classic is worth it.
---
My eyebrows twitched really hard at this.
---
Fucking REALLY? Some random ass new race that no one gives two shits about, but there have been dozens of races, already in the damned lore, that they could have EASILY made playable? Just the idea that a new stupid race could even have a chance of being made playable, when people have been begging for playable races already in-game, is ludicrous to me.
---
Gahd dayum! I'm glad I never got into wow past like BC.
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've seen, many people will level hunters and there will be many that make it to 60. However, many might switch roles due to Hunters falling off late game. Not severely, but relative to how easy they are to play and PvP with pre-60 with only decent gear.  
---
Hunters have a pretty high skill ceiling. Easy to play, difficult to master, and not everyone will take the time to actually master at 60.
---
Yes and it will be glorious.
---
Teremus the Devourer, some black drake in the blasted lands, was lured to Stormwind in the beta, but where everyone was =&lt;30 in level, no one could kill it. And it kept healing faster than guards to do jack shit. Basically fucked the server unless the group wiped it completely to reset.
---
Try CTRL+ using your mouse wheel, maybe you will get somewhere.
---
Thats sad, you missed some nice expansions
---
That fucking thing is supposed  to a playable race...wtf.  Oh how the mighty have fallen.
---
At the very extreme, it‚Äôs unlikely Humans are going to beat out Orcs because Horde can get Shaman Totems AND Paladin Blessings.
---
Not necessarily wrong, they just didn't inform us that weapon skill has a hidden hit rating modifier.
---
+5 weapon skill lowers the hit cap by 1% vs. a level 63 mob. This is a pretty big revelation since that information was never available to us until now.
---
It‚Äôs not a scheme if they were completely transparent with us.
---
These are great, thank you!
---
Does this affect bow specialization for trolls at all as well?
---
Just sap?
---
Right now I'm trying to figure out if there is any way I can get out of wearing devilsaur on my hunter alt lol.
---
I'm running DKP. I wouldn't join a loot council guild and I wouldn't subject anyone to it either. Put in time and you'll get your shit. I don't tolerate orbiters, attention-whores, and sycophants trying to ply their trade of sociopathy in an effort to get digital shinies. Publicly-accessible numbers will determine who gets what, instead of the guild-within-a-guild clique that abuses the other 90 members like NPCs to gear themselves.
---
Train one of the starting area and train one of the starting beasts. Run away and use ‚ÄúEyes of the Beast‚Äù. Walk around/mimic the NPC while waiting for a low level to attack. Once flagged for PVP, run out and kill them.
---
Yeah, there‚Äôs a very large speedrunning community on private servers that is migrating over to Classic. They‚Äôve re-written the book on many boss strategies and class min/maxing.
---
Gonna need cites for all of that.
---
I was under the impression that it was 1.2% chance to hit, 25% smaller glancing penalty, and .2% lower chance to be parried/dodged/blocked and .2% increased crit.
---
Where do you get your numbers?
---
Even better go Night Elf. Meld in any neutral town. Sick pet on hordies and watch em die. Repeat as long as you want. Just be careful to not get pulled from meld.
---
Neither dungeons nor raids scale with the group size in Classic.
---
Mace spec is sadly a bit underpowered in classic. Mace stuns DR with kidney shot and cheap shot which can really mess you up in PvP.
---
In PvE you just go for the spec that has the highest DPS and you don't need to worry about threat as a Rogue. As an Alliance player you have three very excellent tools for managing your threat. Blessing of salvation, vanish and feint. You'll most likely never end up using feint in raids, and in dungeons you're often meant to help the tank handle mobs for short periods of time by tanking/crowd controlling them. So feint is usually just seen a waste of energy that could have been used to kill whatever you're fighting.

---
Weapon Expertise talent gives rogues +5 weapon sword/dagger/fist weapon skill so weapon skill isn't as big a factor for them.
---
Look. Great post.
---
I resubbed, the chances are slim but I‚Äôd rather roll the dice than miss out for sure. I did get into the stress test though, that was really fun.
---
He's right, even if it's not really him. You caused more of a community interaction than most people combined before classic was announced, some people are hypocrites.
---
I just started playing one on a private server. It‚Äôs really making me second guess my choice of maining warrior.
---
1,) you want the slowest weapon you can find in your main hand, reason being, most of your instant abilities calculate off of % of that weapon damage.
---
2.) the defacto leveling spec is this: http://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xcZG0EzbVzxbo
---
But f it, it‚Äôs a rogue pick what you want, any tree will work. 
---
3.) every humanoid and undead can be pickpocketed. Do this to everyone you can. It‚Äôll make you a ton of cash early on and get you a ton of lock boxes to open to level lock picking. 
---
4.) professions are up to you, but I personally would do alchemy and herbalism. I love having health potions to pop. They saved me in a 3v1 pvp scenario where I came out the victor. 
---
Otherwise, skinning and mining would be a solid money maker. 
---
Optimal for pvp is engineering in all circumstances

Wat. How on earth will horde get pally blessings exactly?

Priest is the most sought after healer in Classic.
---
The game will not function properly with layering artery phase 2.
---
It would compromise the world bosses.
---
Ion and a few other devs are on record saying it will never be used after phase 2.
---
Pretty sure it's not going to be used after phase 2 as it would destroy any credibility that they have left.
---
thanks much better  https://imgur.com/HT5oFKu
---
i see so slower weapons do more damage in general? should i also be looking to get slow weapons towards endgame and stuff like that or should i stick to a certain type
---
Its always priests but any healer is something that is brought to raids.
---
When you play classic, WoW really is live action.
---
A cool dude on my server drew my level 20 [xp-locked/f2p](https://i.imgur.com/xVSvLvg.jpg) warrior a few years back. I was planning on going for the set in classic since it's all from vanilla except the belt but sadly if I want the razorsteel shoulders then I'll miss out on the diamond flask. [Here's how it looks in the wowhead dressing room.](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ89cczoso9m8okX808oVK87cMmb808OA808oYX808zUy808Mmr808cDZ808Mmd808HA808cgZ87c) Yes, that's a limb cleaver and not a whirlwind axe.
---
The problem is that a large portion of the people who play the first month will not be playing in 6 months or a year from now. By layering servers, they give people the feel of playing on a slightly larger than vanilla populated server at launch, while not having to worry about having dead servers once people quit.
---
None of you are Olympic sprinters and comparing WoW to that is absolutely retarded.
---
Guilty
---
It wasn't 9% all along though.  It was 9% dependent on your weapon skill.
---
But more importantly, it was still 8% chance to miss if you had no hit%.
---
priest is probably the most sought after but choose whatever healing class you think is the most fun cuz you will always get a spot anyways
---
If you're Horde, Shaman is SUPER sought after, people bring along like 1 per group in raids, meaning 8 resto shamans in a 40 man. It's always super easy to find groups as long as you're a decent player.
---
I really do not see the issue there, bud.
---
The con wasn't about hiding anything, the con was knowing how their playerbase enjoys gambling and they put hope on a string and made a quarter million dollars from it.
---
I appreciate it friend.
---
It‚Äôs not like it will be hard to find out, or prevalent. All major streamers and the like plan on being on one PvP server.
---
Or even "mastEro".
---
Yes, I still believe this.
---
At the beginning of 2010, you could buy over 300 Bitcoin for $1.
---
By mid-2010, $1 got you 100 Bitcoin.
---
1 Bitcoin is worth about $8,000 today.
---
At it‚Äôs peak a few years ago, 1 Bitcoin was trading for almost $20,000.
---
So $30 would get you almost 10,000 Bitcoin in 2010.
---
That‚Äôs almost $80 million today and almost $200 million at its peak.
---
All of the healers are valuable with priest being the best and druids being the worst.
---
Dwarf priest
---
It will be by the time i get there.
---
Rogues get the weapon skill from combat, or dagger skill from core leather gloves if they're Seal Fate.  This doesn't hurt them that much.
---
Presumably yes, that said bow specialization is not reason to go troll over Orc. There's only one viable PvE bow and that's Rhok'delar. After that it's all crossbows and guns. (Ashjre'thul, Larvae of the Great Worm and Nerubian Slave Maker.)
---
Early on weapon type doesn‚Äôt matter. When you get to level 30-35 you get to spec into a weapon type (maces, daggers, swords) I‚Äôd say leveling sword rogue is optimal which is the build I gave you there. It‚Äôs the most forgiving to a new player.
---
The alternative is dagger rogue, which focuses on opening with an attack called ambush, then switching weapons after the opener. 
---
Endgame, there‚Äôs a couple builds that are viable. Both daggers and swords are used. I‚Äôd say daggers are used less than swords. But swords would be superior for pvp. You‚Äôd likely have less competition for a set of bombass daggers though.
---
You absolutely looking to min max your character? Reason I ask is if you‚Äôre going alliance or horde race choice can have a big impact.
---
yes! me!  
---
back in the archimonde days I was a paladin
---
guys stop making me want to roll a priest again
---
That time blizzard told us that they would be inviting a healthy mix of old and new players to the beta. Then only invited streamers, and people that started playing in 2004/2005. :(
---
So by the end of phase 1 - when there are still 10s of thousands of players on some servers what happens?
---
10 hour queues of free transfers to a dead server.
---
So streamer servers will have 10 hour queues? Do streamers then get queue priority when they log on, or are they supposed to wait in queue?
---
To simply said - blizzard will figure it out or that there will be queues and fee transfers is neglecting the reality that there is zero % chance that the population will be low enough to merge all layers on every serve without some servers having insane 6+hour queues.
---
Okay, as long as you are prepared to either be A. On a dead server, or B. Sit in 6+ hour queues.
---
I‚Äôve been seeing mobs parrying from behind on streams pretty consistently, i guess it‚Äôs just a bug though
---
Alliance if you prefer nice clean industrious cities, brave warriors, pretty women, and dwarves with manly beautiful beards. 
---
Horde if you like living in a mud hut, fucking your cousin, and OD'ing on meth while wandering around WalMart at 2am looking for a bag of Bugels to put on your fingers and pretend you are Wolverine's retarded brother.
---
Cool i hope so.
---
Not that I have anything against Streamers. I just don't want to be on the same server as them and their hound dogging posse that follows them like paparazzi, because when the streamer leaves the posse goes with them. And they will leave.
---
And cocaine. Don't forget the cocaine.
---
Don't try and force others(especially your SO) into your hobby.
---
LF guild NA PVP Alliance.
---
Prefer 8-11 cst 2-3 nights a week
---
Planning on Hunter main with a focus on Raiding through Nax with pvp as a side.
---
Have discord Phoenyx#0937
---
Planning on helping the guild out as much as possible but am in college so a semi-hardcore guild is preferred.
---
Should be fine. Best strat is probably afflic lock chucking dots out on 5-6 mobs and when they group up mage nova/coc and blizzards them.
---
The greatest threat of all.
---
I applaud you. I tried priest and was terrible at healing my party. Maybe i'll go shaman next time.  Idk.
---
Oh shit I played on archimonde for BC and wrath, horde side tho. Bwals the rogue
---
MY CABBAGES!!
---
"Got them for free by doing hours of work".
---
oh not to the point of changing races type min maxing. i‚Äôll probably roll an undead, but orcs look cool too, but they‚Äôre broad shouldered and don‚Äôt really fit a rogue imo.‚Äôl
---
right, so i‚Äôll probably go with swords. got it.
---
You can be mind controlled and buffed by the opposite faction I believe
---
Priest is the default healer (either as Holy or one Disc Priest per raid). Good single or party healers.     
---
Druid is annoying because they lack a "real" resurrect, it is on a 30 minute cooldown (although combat rez is situationally useful as is Innervate). Raids often brought at least one Resto Druid for those plus GotW. They're very fun PvP healers (due to defensive stance shifting and flag running).      
---
Pallys are buff bots that also happen to be good single target healers. Generally they'd just spam heal the tanks, while the Priests did the parties. Their party auras and buffs make them worth bringing. Also niche things like their stun (adds/trash only, bosses are immune) and Divine Protection for aggro transfers/rescues were situationally useful.   
---
No opinion on Shaman in vanilla.
---
Estimates put the number of potential players at around 100k. Each paying $15 per month.
---
Given the trite initial *and* continuous investment required(since the game was 90% done from the very first day and they don't plan on addying any new content) they'd be fools NOT to do this. It just prints money.
---
If the party is desperate. Ive done hunter pet or demon pet be tank. Sometimes even rogue if they have high stamina.
---
It clearly is though, every decent sized streamer is getting in even if they‚Äôd never touched the game beforehand.
---
I just want to say because you mentioned pandas how awesome it was that they were split, and also their into starting zone. I miss MoP :(
---
Chill yo...
---
Pretty sure it means ‚Äúnot a chance.‚Äù
---
Oh right, I forgot crossbows don't get the bonus. Orc it is!
---
Here in Phoenix it will still be 110 degrees lol. It doesn't actually cool down until October
---
Meh you‚Äôre on horde so the race doesn‚Äôt have a huge impact anyway. Not the way it does for alliance - Humans get +5 weapon skill to swords and maces which is OP for rogues and warriors. 
---
I didn‚Äôt do a good job explaining the why the slow weapons - rogues first ability is called sinister strike. It costs 40 or so energy and immediately causes weapon damage equal to the damage of the main hand weapon .
---
So if you have a sword that is a 2.8 speed that hits for 104 and vs a 1.4 speed dagger that hits for 52. Your sinister strike will hit for 104 with the sword vs 52 with the dagger.
---
The only way the dagger makes sense is if you open with an ambush which does 360% (can‚Äôt remember exact percentage) of weapon damage to the main target.
---
Can't wait to watch streams of it while we all play classic.
---
lol same. got in the stress test tho. i subscribed after the initial beta announcement.
---
Andorhal
---
Well in that case. Deport every one non Tauren, troll and elf. Every other race is Titan made.
---
Goblins are titan made. Human (worgen) too.
---
Is there any benefit to using edge masters on a human or an orc, would weapon skill 310 (312) add any huge benefit?
---
But what's wrong with that? They aren't hurting anyone as long as they are upfront about it and don't spring it on you after they've taken an hour of your time. If you aren't happy with your share of loot then just don't join the raid. Putting a raid together is work and if they want to be compensated for that extra work then they should be able to do that. You say that it's not much effort, but it's more effort than all the rest of the raid was willing to put in or else they would have started their own raid group instead of looking for one to join.
---
But his name is pedantic--asshole
---
Essentially yes.
---
The idea being they can intentionally overpopulate servers, without the performance impact, to them leave them with very healthy populations a couple of months later once the "tourists" have left.
---
And it's also not a hard division. You can still play with people you know, or your guild. As it'll put people together who group 100% of the time, and generally prioritise putting people together who are in the same guild (but only explicitly put you on the same layer for certain at a given time if you group up).
---
Blizzard has the final say - you don't decide anything. 
---
Do your job - report and move on.
---
Druid tank is sleeper op
---
I can't remember the name, but I really liked the one in TBC in Zangermarsh where the last boss was that War of the Worlds looking spore monster that would lift you up with its tentacles.
---
Rogues already have 5 weapon skill to swords baked into the combat tree so it's less of an issue for them. Sure, it's nice to have those additional 5 skill, but going from 300 to 305 is ~3 (I don't think it's entirely clear yet how weapon skill above 305 and glancing blows and hit interact so take this with a grain of salt) as impactful as going from 305 to 310.
---
Going from 300 to 305 gives you 3% hit, 2% crit, -0.5% dodge (possibly more?) and makes your glancing blows go from 65% to 85%. Going from 305 to 310 makes your glancing blows go from 85% to 95% (100%? Further testing/info needed) and probably does some things with hit/crit/dodge but not as much.
---
You're assuming with that, though, that the 8% additional parry is entirely from the weapon skill rather than the level difference.
---

---
wait, that's illegal
---
Hunters are a ton of fun and arguably have more shenanigans than any other class. They're not top tier raid dps later on, but they have a very high skill cap and are a ton of fun in both BG PvP and World PvP.
---
Plus they are one of the most self-sufficient classes. They are a truly great choice imo.
---
The audio is shockingly low though
---
I don't really have friends who play lol. So I'll mostly be leveling alone with impromptu formed groups for required quests and dungeons.
---
Also, I'm not really certain which faction I'm playing yet either. I was leaning toward Alliance simply because I've always played Horde and wanted to experience something new. So I've been leaning toward Pally as well. But I don't know if I'll be able to handle leveling one, especially alone lol. If I can put up with it, I'll probably stick with it and main Pally.
---
If I can't, that's when it'll comes down to either priest or shaman. If it comes to that I might go back to plan B: Make both, get to 15 or so and then just play the one I'm having more fun with.
---
Or that's my plan right now at least.
---
oh oh i see i see
---
so if i were to roll alliance i‚Äôd go human? understood
---
I‚Äôm 22, full time job and active social life. I plan on no lifeing when this game comes out. There will be stuff to do. Enough people will be bored one day or night and the memes will start flowing. It‚Äôs not if but when.
---
Leaked! Amazing!
---
He's wrong. It's an ~8% reduction if you can somehow get to 315 skill, not if you're just at 305.
---
I pull out my wizard hat and staff
---
Nyeh... I'll take their advice and wait for August to resub.
---
Well, optimally yes.
---
Optimally on horde id go a troll warrior because I want to tank, but they‚Äôre butt ugly and I hate their animations and having no shoes blows. So orc it is for me. 
---
More important to pick a race you like staring at for hundreds of hours imo.
---
If you truly are him, you are a hero, bravo!
---
I've played a lot on both factions and they're no different. It just seems like it is because horde get to safely level higher and the pvp zones they get into are questing zones for both factions so you'll have higher level people from both factions there ganking, whereas places like redridge, duskwood and wetlands are alliance only for questing so you just get assholes ganking you there and maybe if you're lucky someone comes to kill them.
---
Layers are essentially invisible sub-servers. e.g. Bloodhoof-US-1, Bloodhoof-US-2 and Bloodhoof-US-3, up to how ever many they need.
---
I used to love to sap random people but not kill them. Makes them nervous without being too mean
---
Probably TradeChat.  Mark Kern mentioned her ‚Äúslandering‚Äù him before on his stream. I‚Äôd have to look into it later.
---
I said take all my money and I meant it.
---
Where is this 3% hit coming from? Has there been information that weapon skill is actually more than 0.04% hit per point? The way I read the blue post is that 305 weapon skill only shaves off the hardcoded 1% hit.
---
Wonder how many more times you'll reply to this thread in an attempt to defend your melee hunter strats lol
---
All healers are good. Paladin healers are extremely efficient, priests are obviously the best, druids are great for HoTs, shamans have great totems and I believe they have chain heal as well I‚Äôm vanilla (I didn‚Äôt play shaman until wotlk so I couldn‚Äôt tell you on that) but there‚Äôs really no bad healer. They all have their niche they fill in Vanilla.
---
Any two classes can level together and overpower the crap out of the content designed for just solo players. So, yes, a Frost Mage and Warlock can level together and will do great.    
---
That being said: The synergy is kind of meh.    
---
A Frost Mage can level two ways: AOE or non-AOE. With AOE the Warlock adds little, even if they dot all the mobs, it doesn't really change the dynamic of the actual pull just the speed.      
---
With single target, the Frost Mage is evading and playing for shatter procs/crits for big burst on frozen targets. The Warlock's pet may break freezes or the Warlock's direct damage might. Plus you'll often "over-kill" the mob (bad/waste of time).      
---
As I said at the start: Any two classes can do great together. Including these two. But if you're asking me if they're a natural fit, I'd say no. A **Fire** Mage or a Fire/Arcane mix would be awesome (since Fire just pew pew while the Warlock's pet tanks the mobs).   
---
The biggest downside with fire normally is that you lose life saving utility (like Ice Block, Ice Barrier, Imp. Frost Nova, etc). But with a Warlock watching your back + pet, those downsides are less significant. Plus Improved Scorch (+fire damage) could have some interesting cross-play.
---
&gt; I wanna see that dance between every pull when you're not drinking.
---
So you DON'T want to see the dance?
---
TL;DR
---
8% chance of missing, first 1% from gear/talents is ignored. *Effective* hitcap is 9%. Having 305 or more weapon skill means you ignore that "first 1% is ignored" rule.
---
Examples:
---
* 300 Weapon Skill with no +hit items will have 8% chance of missing
---
* 300 Weapon Skill with 1% hit from items will have 8% chance of missing
---
* 300 Weapon Skill needs 9% hit to never miss
---
* 305 Weapon Skill needs 8% hit to never miss
---
From what I heard recently, glancing blow damage can only be increased to 95% of a normal hit through weapon skill. So the real benefit of weapon skill will end after 308 skill. Weapon skill is still beneficial beyond 308, by lessening your chance to miss, be parried, or be dodged, but there's no additional reduction of glancing blow damage loss, so the effect is severely diminished.
---
You'll probably need to be putting in \~25+ hours per week to get rank 10.
---
There's very little shit that is of this caliber in terms of comedic timing.
---
You genuine have shat out a gold bar here and i'm not fucking with you.
---
Good. Good.
---
See this is the issue with ‚ÄúWorld PVP‚Äù as the chads like to call it. It‚Äôs really just a cover up word for ganking. See, no one is impressed when you say ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôve been ganking people 30 levels lowers than me while they try to quest for 3 hours‚Äù
---
So instead they say ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôve been doing some world PvP for 3 hours‚Äù anyone with half a brain will roll on a PVE server come classic launch.
---
It‚Äôs only like that because on a pserver there‚Äôs nothing to do since Classic is going to come out.
---
On a real server, there‚Äôs so much to do that you don‚Äôt see that type of griefing; high levels are in high level areas doing high level things.
---
Everyone saying its bad like you‚Äôre gonna pull one mob at a time... 
---
even if you‚Äôre just duo leveling your kill efficiency goes through the roof compared to solo, with 4 people you can easily be fighting 10 mobs at once and blitzkrieg the shit out of zones
---
No you can't.  You can't cast mind controlled targets spells, just move them and auto attack.
---
I will endure till release. Still have much to do with working out / calisthenics and programming so urge to play is manageable.
---
Well barrens has mobs up to lvl 25 so if you're really desperate you could easily lvl to like lvl 28 just in barrens with literally 0 ways of ever getting ganked.
---
This made me laugh!
---
Dungeons and dragons books have inked drawings like this one. You got a real talent for it, and should look into illustration for fantasy games and books as a career. What color mount will you buy though?
---
LETS GO!
---
The Barrens and even Silverpine is Horde territory, redridge and duskwood are contested. Also you wont be saying this once youve leveled through hillsbrad, stv, tanaris or a number of other zones
---
Meh id rather wait for the live game, spent far too much time in previous games beta only to get bored of live too fast. Been able to setup mods,  UI and keybinds would be nice but.
---
Lmao there are actually people who will pay to resub early just to pick a name.  Pathetic.
---
is this the new xbox 360 joke?
---
You‚Äôre misinformed. Druids are fully competent 5 man tanks and a very close second to warriors in raids.
---
Was fine for me? They were straiht from tips out stream?
---
Depends on mob. I've consistently kited everything to 30. Sometimes you get autod twice as you start the kite. Thats pretty much it. 
---
I don't know what you guys are doing but I'm getting tired of seeing this. It may just be ping differences or not waiting long enough for auto speed.
---
Like some people mentioned, rogues get weapon skill anyway.
---
But just look how sexy orc fury warriors are now, considering that all the best endgame weapons are axes.
---
I have been convinced.
---
Half of this sub it seems like.
---
Same with priest Fort.
---
Really wish I could still sell my accurascopes lol
---
*two inches of dangling fury has connected*
---
Alts are the number one strategy for PvP servers. If you run into camps, work off that rested XP on your side character(s).
---
I can't play Horde. I play video games to *escape* reality, not simulate it.
---
Blizzard never said "dont resub for beta" or "very slim."
---
They said that if you resub you have a chance without elucidating what that chance was, invited a tiny portion of people and streamers, and then only a week later said "lol invites are done cya aug 27." This and the the blatant "resub 2 weeks in advance to reserve a name for no reason" stuff is slimy.
---
The thing is there‚Äôs a reason these specs are off meta and the reason is they fucking suck. It‚Äôs not like mtg where you can still beat meta with jank if you get lucky or moba where you can 1v9 carry with any champion if you‚Äôre good enough
---
Actually I'm not sure. I thought there was a 2% in addition to the 1%, but now I can't find a source for it, so I'll edit my post. Thanks!
---
The guy comes across as a sleazeball so hearing the little information presented isn't great for him. He's an idiot and liar when it comes to vanilla, so again, it makes sense.
---
Hunter does that way better though
---
is this madness?
---
yeah that‚Äôs the rough part. i don‚Äôt like how the bones puncture through gear on UD, and orcs look cool as fuck but they just don‚Äôt fit the rogue type i guess. but even then, female orcs have terrible animations imo lmao so it‚Äôs a hard choice
---
1. Alliance Priest alt on on Secondary Account #1 mind controls a Horde raid member.
---
2. Alliance Paladin alt on Secondary Account #2 buffs the Horde raid member.
---
3. Horde raid member logs off to preserve buff.
---
4. Repeat 40 times.
---
5. Everyone logs in, zones in, and kills boss within 15 minutes.
---
6. World record speed run complete.
---
We‚Äôve been doing this on PServers for years.
---
No? I just started seeing stuff about vanilla wow being a thing again and was interested
---
There were the occasional ganks, if I‚Äôm honest. Sap was my go-to for trolling people though.
---
May be a ping issue. I do it consistently. Some mobs just move faster or their hitboxes are bigger. Its consistent with how mobs are designed with "thematic armor values" and stuff like that. Some mobs just have a faster speed. 
---
Still if you have a slow weapon most of the time you can get away with 1 auto hitting you in between. 2 at the start, if its a big box and you aren't perfect, or if its a fast moving mob. Its still efficient and for me its consistent but I have 30 ping.
---
Nice memes KEK

I see. Thanks for the response! I am planning on joining a friends guild and it seems like it‚Äôll be a hardcore guild so hopefully I can do well and secure Atiesh for myself early on.
---
I'm not assuming. Blizzard explained it to us.
---
UD racial melts faces in pvp though. On demand fear/charm break is God tier. 
---
Plus female rogues jump slash is the god tier of all animations.
---
It is funny laughing at the PvP chads isn‚Äôt it? Blizzard really shot them self in the foot with the phase schedule of classic. No battle ground or PVP system at launch is the worst decision they could of made. 
---
Once all the PVP chads get to cap they are going to start looking for PVP but with no battle grounds or a honour system to grind out, it doesn‚Äôt really matter who they kill or where they kill them. Do you really think these poor unintelligent chads are going to go to level 60 zones and look for level 60 PvP? Hell no, their going to sit on the roofs of lakeshire in redridge and kill people 40 levels lower than them on the way back from killing 10 Murlocs. Then tell their guildies ‚Äúyeah bro, I‚Äôve been doing some sick world PVP in redridge today!‚Äù
---
Oh then it should run swimmingly if your internet works well.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Hell of a good look. Kinda Dark Souls-ish.
---
The game is also famous for toxicity, hell it practically invented it
---
Also, sapping players, killing their pets, then leaving is always fun. They spend the next 5 minutes running in circles assuming you're going to open on them. Then they eventually go to resummon the pet and you sap again.
---
thats not even what sharding is
---
Pservers are chaotic right now because of the looming release of classic. The established crowd is geared to the teeth and has nothing to do but gank anything that moves. Classic will be different unless you wait until after Naxx is out to level up.
---
Where are you getting 3.5% to hit? Doesnt this mean its plus 1% from the post?
---
Human paladin confirmed
---
Well his networth is 2mil and he currently has ~20k subs on twitch.
---
People just used to stand in front of the AH using /shout to offer their services...
---
...enchanting services ofcourse. You all have filthy minds.
---
The pickpocket value on pservers was derived mostly from Rogue‚Äôs Diary which is contained in the pickpocketed lockboxes and vendors for about 50s. It really depends on how often and at which level you can obtain it
---
Can you get one with 3 pedals ?
---
that game is god tier fps. it‚Äôs just so goddamn good
---
A true scholar
---
&gt;  Not that you have the mental capacity to understand something like that.
---
I love how you go straight to insults. 
---
You replied to someone asking a simple question that didn't even involve harassment and brought up breaking the ToS. He doesn't care, he just wanted to know where they were dueling. 
---
You say "people" like every reddit user is one collective mind.
---
Facts:Tips gets doxxed. He commited major fraud in the past with a contracting compan. Is ignorant on alot of topics in classicwow. Opens patreon despite ignorance. Has sob story of losing job which was related to the fraud in the 
---
Speculation: Lots of legal fees. Decides milking the hot new MMO bandwagon of classicwow for $$$$$ and it worked.
---
Was the rolled up thing on the left
---
Also helpful to any Shamans reading! Drop Earthbind and kite a mob in circles while leveling, only dip in to smack it with your weapon when you have an attack up!
---
i am. still no invite. also 2004 account subscribed for 14 years now.
---
That 8% reduction would be at 315 wep skill though, not 305. at 305 it would be quite a lot less.
---
That's strange, I have 2000 hours in PUBG and I don't think I've ever had a problem with streamers.
---
Just don't roll on their servers...
---
You managed to take a lighthearted joke about inconsistent tooltips with and and turn it into a way to moan about *the casuals*. That, in combination with the fact that "kid" is your go-to insult, speaks volumes about what a humorless, insufferable manchild you truly must be.
---
If you think people will have time to do some casual ganking for the first few months you're sorely mistaken.. that's usually for after you have your pre-bis, waiting for raid CDs, bored of BGing, bored of helping your guildies out with leveling, not feeling like making an alt. There's a lot of priorities before ganking lowbies.
---
However some people want notoriety - the fantasy of being infamous in a certain zone to the point the entire other faction hates your guts and constantly send death squads after you. 
---
You may not think it now, but at some point even that will be a fond memory. When I was alliance in vanilla there was a orc rogue camping out menethil harbor area. Really solid PvPer and a pain in the ass. You never knew if he was there or not, but would strike when you least expect it. 
---
When it comes to alliance ganking horde... It was actually mostly just hunters thatd gank you - but without the charm or RP element of the horde ganks. It felt less personal and more like a person sitting with a straight face, barely any emotion and just grinding. Like even he didn't find it fun to do, but just did it as his braincells barely could discern hordes from mobs.
---
Tldr leveling will be easy. A gank here and there will happen. Have an alt if you get corpse camped. Return the favour and flavour your life with ganking at times
---
2 weeks early that is 5$ for three names and charakter creation so you can start the game right away on launch.
---
I can 100% guarantee that I will be ganking the shit out of every aliance skum I meet on my path.  Git Gud son!
---
This is vanilla. We used to camp low levels for hours until they either logged off or logged onto their main, and we camped their main too.
---
All good, thanks for the clarification.
---
Carbonite fell apart because blizz added everything it did in to the base game. I used it for a long time. Though I loved it dearly, I'll be flying solo this round. Still, I understand the desire for it. I never would have figured wow out without it!
---
Yep, pservers have even low level pickpockets in like 30-50c range
---
Who's who and what's what? And why what for?
---
Sit down and make notes...
---
1. Create a new alt
---
2. send him some gold
---
3. find spot near blacksmith and mailbox
---
4. buy tons nonstackable Blacksmith Hammer 12c each
---
5. go to mail and send hammers to someone
---
6. repeat 4 - 5
---
7. Logout and delete the character - don't let him just send it back
---
8. Profit
---
in 20 minutes you can send them even about 500
---
#nochanges #wartsandall
---
You mustn‚Äôt be in the top 3 spots of that persons list then. Anyone who was In the top 3 spots of someone‚Äôs F&amp;F list got an invite today.
---
They are literally the worst class to level..
---
Blizzard should hire this man!
---
Runic from MisFits then Re1ent1ess
---
Is he still relevant?
---
So sad to see the uneducated PVP chads showing up in force in this thread. I hope one day you gain enough brain cells to reroll to the alliance, friend.
---
Nobody called for a ban just for a TP on the other continent. Not being a bannable offense doesn't mean you're not a massively retarded sperg.
---
yes
---
What is the actual fuck is everyone talking about herE? Serious, I have no clue, but kinda want to
---
So what you're saying is, TBC pserver with flying and dailies removed?
---
That sounds very doable to me.
---
&gt; So what‚Äôs the lowdown on disc then? They are good in rbgs but anything else? I think I saw there is usually one shadow weaving disc in raids and the rest are holy? Sounds like sadly there‚Äôs no way to do it all as shadow/disc and you pretty much have to go holy if you don‚Äôt want to respec all the time.
---
Something like [this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/BMH3PzQDzNgMAA), deep discipline with holy splash (Divine Spirit is good to get for PvE though), does excellent as an end-game PvE and premade PvP healer. 
---
Shadow Weaving is a different story, aye, sometimes your guild will take an actual shadow priest and sometimes they'll just take a healer priest with enough for shadow weaving. You could do this as Disc as well, either 30/0/21 or go less in Shadow to take PI, if you want a solid PvP spec. 
---
Either way deep Disc works pretty well with talent variations depending on what exactly you're trying to do.
---
World PvP just means feeling like you're playing in an actual world at war.
---
Everything has more gravity to it...., herbs, ore, skins I gather are worth more, farming certain areas for mats and items hold more weight and value. It's not about the glooming anxiety of getting ganked or wanting to attack weak players.
---
I like going to my favorite grinding spot in a high level zone and if someone else is there from the opposing faction I can fight them for the mobs instead of rushing to share them like on a PvE.
---
I also like how even across factions you can make a name for yourself as either a respectful player or an asshole that ganks low levels or people when they're low at health eating.
---
It allows the community and server to come alive, creating honorable players and villians on each unique server.
---
ODD GROUPS LEFT. EVEN GROUPS RIGHT.
---
...
---
Aw, crap. Wrong dragon.
---
Wasnt the problem to begin with that they were listening to the fans?
---
The events that led to BFA is the real 'you think you do but you dont' if you ask me
---
The best one from me is editing item strings to do things like link a level 12 sword with 84 agility to barrens chat. Or advertise a ‚ÄúHearthstone of Shadow Wrath‚Äù with 54 shadow damage. I got a lot of ‚Äúwtf?‚Äù And ‚Äúhacker‚Äù whispers, as well as a time that someone woke up their priest class leader to buy my ‚Äú72 healing dragon finger of healing‚Äù.
---
troll needs 8% because they have bow skill; 3% from survival talents leaving 5% to obtain (minus even more assuming you gaint some hit rating for the actual weaponskill values). Traditionally on pservers this 5 weapon skill was 3% hit assumed. 
---
IF that ends up true, a troll hunter can get away with needing 2% hit.... thats mindblowing.
---
This wave was for F&amp;F top 3 for blizzard. If you don't know someone who know someone, this round of invites weren't for you. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you, but don't be mad about that. It's a beta man, I know theres not a lot of good games out there ATM.. but here's some suggestions:
---
Mordhau
---
PUBG
---
Apex Legends
---
Or if it needs to be RPG - replay all of Dragon Age games, that'll set you back a few weeks.
---
How about the new anno game? It's honestly killer!
---
It ain't classic, but it's something to do other than getting pissed for no reason.
---
I will hunt you down! Boi!
---
Some do. Many don't. It's going to take me a looooong time to level because exploring and alts and professions and do all the quests and so forth.
---
You can still play retail though, you could play that for a couple of months. I'm multiple expansions behind, thought about re-subbing for that but nah.
---
On the beta right now, quests you turn in at level 30 give around 1.5 to 2.5 g a piece. Surely it's more than that for level 60 quests.
---
Neigh.
---
Oh please, it's not basic psychology. Greed : Intense and selfish desire for something. I guess you could argue that at its core you are at the very least greedy to survive. But that is certainly not true either, because many people will lay down their lives for those of others. This is not some simple fact of psychology and you know it. You are treading into philosophical territory that is debated to this day.
---
You don't think 40 people exist that would rather spread gear out and progress through the content ? In order to actually get geared out, it's in your best interest to clear the content easily with a similar group of players. You think humans always act in their own interest? No, they also can act in the interest of the collective. This is ACTUALLY basic game theory, not some bullshit psychology you think is fact.
---
Wat
---
Yeah it makes having 1% hit entirely useless which is funny haha.
---
Pserver scene, healers are the hardest spots to fill on a 40 man. Guild raiding cores have always dedicated people on tanking spots
---
They are probably in the bottom half and definitely take so.e skill but not the worst. I leveled during vanilla and didn't have any troubles. Definitely a high skill cap so I can see why a certain part of the playerbase has trouble.
---
Yeah it's not 9% though, its 8% with 1% ignored which is genuinely different. No one knew about that I'm sure.
---
&gt;  Creatures that are 3 levels above the player have a 14% Parry chance in our Reference client. This holds true for our Classic client as well.
---
Says nothing about defense skill being the sole reason for the disparity.
---
lok'tar ogar Give me ORE!!!
---
Also rogues that are BWL geared can easily solo Dungar Longdrink. He is the SW flight master and that was one of the best parts of playing rogue.
---
But you yourself said 15k? And the number is indeed relevant. What if the set the server caps to 4k and just used layering to ease the initial leveling experience?
---
I rather play on a private server while I wait than throw money at blizzard and doing their job.
---
Same. Putting my money where my mouth is. Will stay subbed till classic - and until classic is no fun for me anymore.. maybe after 1-2 years. Maybe 3. I'll get bored eventually I'm sure.
---
45 euro ain't nothing over a course of 3 months.
---
That's just how non figurative it was
---
Good luck with that! My self and literally everyone I know that plays wow will be playing on a PVE server come classic. You chads can gank each other‚Äôs alts for fun.
---
There's some merit to having a dagger rogue or two, to use the good dagger drops while every other warrior/rogue fights over the scarce sword drops
---
Rend is useless, only good to keep rogues from vanishing
---
That's LITERALLY what I said in MY post!!!
---
&gt;This is something that im actively working on rewiring in my brain. For so many years on retail i was a 'gogogo, powerlevel' kind of person. Just go to the next objective, queue up for another dungeon, etc.
---
This can be fun too.
---
Wow, thanks! My only downfall there is that I've never been great at coloring, and most of those books have colored illustrations. I should practice it more but I just love B&amp;W so much... As for mount, my first mount was the brown skeletal horse so I'll probably get that one again since nostalgia always wins out, lol.
---
Dot then  bomb/repeat
---
And who do you think is worse? There's no class that levels slower and harder
---
Obviously, but it didn't take that much time and is easy to do while watching shit or playing.
---
wat
---
Im sorry you don‚Äôt understand what an analogy is. Think about it like this. A is to B what C is to D. I‚Äôm not comparing A to C. 
---
It‚Äôs a comparison to make a simple point. I‚Äôm obviously not saying WoW players are olympic athletes. 
---
Not everyone times themselves when they run 100 meters. My point is that some people like to do things the best they can.
---
The guy is a fraud.
---
I did World pvp on my warrior and battlegrounds once they were implemented. I made it to Knight Captain and then decided start raiding instead of trying to chase a title I couldn‚Äôt get to. I was active duty at the time and didn‚Äôt have the time to grind 16 hours a day to get to grand marshal. The twinks were horde projects I made in various brackets because twinking on my server was prevalent on both sides. It was a fun way to blow off steam.
---
Damn. Imagine having that freedom from life.
---
So with a 2 mil net worth 3 mil annual is possibly sorta close but not quite there.
---
I mean honestly these "chads" aren't going to get to cap that fast you forget the lack of quest to hit 60 quickly like in the current game.. thats the whole point of the timed release. Either way it'll take people longer then you think to hit 60. Most wont even touch 60 before pvp drops
---
I want an undead mage in the alliance.
---
I played a human mage from 2005-2007, when i first saw an UD mage i wanted one ( you dont wanna know how much Gold i spent on Noggenfogger ) then a gnome mage in wotlk and finally an undead mage in 2014 on a P server.
---
There is no way in hell that i can go back to human or gnome after playing UD ( the cast Animation movement etc is just so awesome) but the Zones of the Alliance are just so incredibly amazing mesmerizing epic and gorgeous and above all feel mire like Home than horde ever could.
---
So yup i am fucked
---
stupid system. totally stupid.
---
If I would be Blizz I would at least try to cover it up and invite the F&amp;F list with some smaller public waves.
---
Definitely horse.
---
Probably go back to league since all other games bore me currently. If it wasn't for classic hype id surely not be playing the wotlk private server in on. 
---
I prefer not to think about it. Lol
---
That 3% fire dmg increase from the improved scorch sounds interesting, destro lock/fire mage new meta? But yeah aoe mage builds wouldnt be the best fit with a lock as you mentioned above, so using a voidwalker to tank might be the way to go
---
It is what sharding is, too many people don't understand sharding mechanics
---
Just wait, boosts will be available in due time, we said it would never happen on retail and it did, classic is a far easier thing to milk because nostalgia is oozing from it and the playerbase.
---
But +1 for the attempt
---
I think we've got some confusion here, I was talking about the UbiGeofram saying that the 5 wep skill racial would result in 8% less parries, which is way too high.
---
I think he feels guilt or shame if he would play on a private server and he's asking if he paid for a WoW sub if that somehow makes it all cool.
---
Wonder how many more times you will reply to this thread proving your lack of knowledge
---
It devalues it‚Äôs meaning if 4.5 billion people have it. Things you want a chance at people paid premium for. So if you want it now vs back then you should pay the surcharge, currently on eBay 10,000 dollars
---
the games not hard. unless your speedrunning raids, play a Night Elf Warrior if thats your jam
---
Rofl!
---
On horde, I would imagine this would only matter until the MT gets a thunderfury at which point troll would end up being theoretically superior due to the axe racial of Orc no longer having an impact. 
---
But yeah, huge impact on the alliance side for sure.
---
Shaman and priest are definitely worse. Warriors actually deal a ton of damage while leveling, they don't deal with big pulls without a good player piloting them.
---
By all means, share a bit of your pain over on /r/choosingbeggars if you haven‚Äôt already. They love that shit
---
sharding is literally a grid over the whole map, every box on the grid is its own instance that has a cap of like 50 players or w.e it is
---
What a sellout. This has been possible years ago but they chose not to release to maximize profit potential.
---
memories, I remember people always getting lost, and dying over and over again. And then the mobs did respawn and you had to go back and clear it....  
---
haha.
---
You‚Äôre thinking about improved drain soul. You don‚Äôt have to be the one getting the killing blow to get a soul shard
---
I've had the server for a while now. That doesn't mean your in. Everyone can download the test client.
---
Hell yeah I didn't even play real vanilla
---
I'm guessing it will be pretty bad for the first months till bgs come out. World pvp will be the only option for a while.
---
I hear currently in the beta there is "melee leyway" which makes the hamstring method much harder/not possible. Melee leyway increases the melee range based on attack speed and movement. Meaning that if you (or the opponent)  swing and then the target moves you get increased range to hit the target if they move out of "typical" melee range.
---
Yeah, but once you get enough crit (around AQ level gear) you switch to Seal Fate and no longer have Weapon Expertise, which means the +5 from Humans matters a lot more.
---
I get what you're saying to an extent but your exaggerations aren't likely to get people to agree with you.
---
You're also just repeating with every post, ignoring the responses, and not offering any ideas so I'm not sure what you want from it.
---
In regards to the first question I would imagine that layers could be either merged or split depending on under or overpopulation, with relative ease and minimal negative impact. Layers simply provide flexibility to manage the issue more effectively than in previous iterations.
---
Your streamer complaint seems pretty pointless, as they will likely announce the server they will be on and make it easily avoidable. If they get a priority login (the like... 10 streamers that had an actual impact), good for them. Nobody should complain about that if they were instrumental in bringing the game back by putting in far more effort than the vast majority of us. And the reality is that 10-20 people jumping queue has a tiny impact on wait time, if it even exists. If there is a queue on their server, boo hoo if you willingly chose to go there with that knowledge. 
---
Pleaae just give us a break with the "inevitable 6-10 hour queues" and all the pointless naysaying.
---
Litterally don't roll on the same server as them..
---
What, do you have split personality disorder - one that stalk and obsess over streamers and constantly streamsnipe, and the other who have no idea how you keep running into them?
---
Never heard of your issue before. The streamer population of like 100 vs. litterally millions of players. You have some uncanny luck to run into them. I'd check myself into a place and get checked out if I was you.
---
I got to stop you right here buddy, you cant use a cataclysm map in the classicwow subreddit
---
On Horde, rogues get both with relative ease because all the warriors want Axes.
---
what does it matter?
---
AFAIK explicitly mentioned proc chances like Hand of Justice and Windfury are not PPM (proc per minute) but simply flat chance on hit. Frostbrand and such, on the other end, are known to be PPM. Although trusting Blizzard's intelligence blindly is dangerous, I think a rule of thumb could be said that if a proccable effect's damage is based on the weapon damage then it is a flat chance based proc, else it is PPM based.
---
Pull packs -&gt; Barkskin -&gt; Hurricane -&gt; Bear Form -&gt; Swipe
---
You could always put on reflect damage gear to get more damage done out of the bear form portion of combat.
---
LET US INNNNNNNN
---
Exactly what this guy said
---
We're here discussing classic wow because we're fans of it, why are you here?
---
Or... level up your weapon skill 
---
Idk no need to choose 1 race for the 1 racial unless its pvp related even then not so much
---
So you need to be a subscriber to get a \*chance\* at getting into the beta?
---
In most circumstances the dude who killed you tends to fuck off somewhere else looking for his next victim. 
---
If its particularly bad I just go level somewhere else or look for dungeon groups. 
---
Also, there aren't many feelings that equal having an entire lowbie area ganked for 20-30 mins, and then you read the words "Where the hell are these pussies" in general chat; /who "Heroideserve" and to see he's a level 60 Warrior who brought some friends to push the gankers out.
---
Lmao
---
I‚Äôm surprised they gave Mitch Jones of all ppl beta access lmao the hype must be real 
---
And I mean that by he‚Äôs not really a pg friendly streamer like most that received subs ( correct me if I‚Äôm wrong )
---
Kek horse
---
I bet it will
---
Not useful, with a few exceptions. The HWL caster weapon is useful, and you get some boots that make your ghost wolf better.
---
No, it doesn't work like that. 
---
He likely makes 1.5 million a year judging from the bit of youtube ad revenue, mainly his twitch subs which is roughly 60k a month and raw donations.
---
Can't blink back onto a ledge you've jumped off of. I have a very clear memory of a Mage flag carrier in WSG jumping off the top of the base in the flag room, spinning 180 and blinking back onto the top of the building, while those chasing him all jumped off and fell.
---
Underbog! That boss was the black stalker.
---
Beat me to say he beat me to it
---
Well yeah, but there's no honor gain from it.. so a lot of people will just focus on gearing up or level alts before honor gains drop - and then bgs will be more effective for honor.
---
It's crazy good. I love that weapon skill is way better in classic than it is on PS because it always pissed me off just how badly they got things wrong and basically invalidated the use of many gear pieces that were much better on live.
---
Can't wait to see the meta advance once we're all 60 and trying out new things!
---
Lol really what's hard about using sunder armour?
---
Hmm, interesting. This would only work on PvE realms in Classic, though.
---
A cloth mouse pad
---
listen up you mudder fucks!
---
This makes me realize I don't miss 2005 that much.
---
dwf familar with the Gunny, I was in the Marines myself, RIP Gunny
---
Can you also see a new account in your account list on the website?
---
Ah sorry I thought you were talking about wow classic. Was saying I dont remember anyone ever party tanking back then.... I even remember frost dks being discouraged from dw tanking because of the higher damage intake.
---
Still viable without a respec? Because if you ever plan on getting a fast mount, don't plan on respeccing. Source: was priest
---
Before Classic is over! I will look down on your corps and smile!
---
Two different games.
---
Are dungeons considered grinding?
---
Suck it up pussy! What you are just entitled to level 20? No you have to earn it like everyone else who leveled to Mac on a pvp server.
---
Well.. You don't even use sunder armor when tanking 99% of the time as a warrior. Still think you know what's going on?
---
&gt; World PvP just means feeling like you're playing in an actual world at war.
---
It does. I played 1-30 recently on a PvP server practicing my Alliance leveling route.  I've only played Horde so its a new experience, and I've never played for real on a PvP server.
---
It only took my getting ganked 2-3 times in Redridge before I started to get a little panicked when I'd see a Horde player. Hell I'd see Redridge Orcs in the distance, and I wouldn't be sure if it was a player or a mob and I get little rush.
---
I never really had a "fuck the other faction" mentality, and I think thats because I played on a PvE server. I think if I spent years getting ganked and  wPvPing against a one faction, I might have sour feelings lol
---
* Grind dungeons
---
* Check database for other areas to grind/quest
---
* Favor safer zones, even if mobs are lower level.
---
I resubbed during blizzcon when they announced classic. I said for years if they did a vanilla server I would be back and I wanted to let them know this is why I‚Äôm back.
---
Would you then assume they are going to limit the layers to a certain number?
---
So if 2,3,4 or 100 layers fill up on that server - then what? They lock the server because they anticipate a specific % of players will drop off...
---
And if those players Do Not drop off... 10 hour queues or free transfers to dead servers.
---
Cool :) ... looks like Warcraft 3 Tauren with totem :)
---
I've played both sides to end game in Vanillia and I'm rolling horde again.  That being said, roll alliance.  Lots of fun content you'll be missing out on if you don't.  Darkshire is the bomb.
---
\-Thanks tips
---
In the bin this post goes.
---
Might be true, we will see
---
I loved playing my druid and I would play one this time around if not for the missing resurrect. Such a versatile class but for dungeons just not a good option without a sidekick.
---
Yeah, I definitely decided on them for all those reasons. I just keep seeing myself casting fireball though. God I love fireball. I'll stay strong.
---
surprised this is not upvoted higher.
---
You'll melt faces and murder people.
---
Thanks! And yep, I got everything till the final screenshot! Still re-editing the content though, as it has plenty of bugs and needs at least some editorial adjustments (and adding more screenshots because you know, bandwidth is no problem now!) I will probably post 30-40 somewhere this month!
---
It was vanilla I was talking about. Being careful and methodic can take you far. People wiped regularily with full parties but the main reason for that is pulling too close to other groups.
---
\&gt;Went to check, saw email from Blizzard
---
\&gt;Got hyped
---
\&gt;"Modern Warfare is Back October 25"
---
\&gt;Sadness
---
simple. ALWAYS be 2-3 levels higher. that is still yellow. more of travel to same level zones and multi-mob grinding is still good, will keep you full rage.
---
however most private servers are indeed ridiculous on low hit rating, so it will be much better on Classic.
---
Bingo
---
Well if you read my original remark I was referring to starting to thank, I.e. low level. When you have few abilities.
---
Still think you know how to read?
---
Just finished the final episode (5) today, it was absolutely fantastic and amazing every single episode. Maybe not for everyone but it kept me riveted the entire time.
---
It doesn't really make any difference for ranged weps, you cap hit easily and suffer no glancing blows.
---
Thanks, this was the answer I was looking for!

I see what you're saying now. It seems that OP got his numbers mixed up and put 8% increased parry chance at +5 skill instead of +15.
---
In actuality it's +2.6% chance to parry assuming I understood how the skill system works.
---
Hunters aren't all that great. It'll take about 100-150 optimal hours played for you to reach 60 so 15-30 hours a week is enough to get there on any class as long as you stay focused on leveling.
---
Paladins are generally bad in everything else they do outside of healing so that's a no-no for you. I suggest you go make your Warrior since they can DPS and tank well.
---
You can make a hunter alt and use the rested xp when possible.
---
always exploit LoS kiting
---
What you mean, which macro?

Nice. I also helped the druid class leader get the epic staff from heroic Botanica (Feral Staff of Lashing), he got it on his 108th run. The funny part to me at that point was that I had gotten the druid staff from Karazhan (Terestian's stanglestaff) on my warlock by that point because he was away from raiding for a week.

Will Auction houses be cross-layer? If so then there will be far too many items. If not then how will they work considering you're not always on the same layer. Will you still receive the items you put up on layer 6's AH if you're in layer 3? Receiving gold from another "layer" certainly isn't vanilla. If you bid on a item in layer 2's AH and win the bid will you still receive the item? This will also encourage people to jump to different layers for better prices on certain items in another layer. Blizzard needs to provide some answers for this type of stuff.

Fuck yeaaaa LOKTAR OGAR

I'm a terrible healer but here's how I ranker healers in Vanillia:
---
Priest: best PvE healer and 2ed best PvP healer.
---
Pally: best single target PvE healer and best PvP healer.
---
Shaman: Wind-fury yo!  Everyone will love you and want to have your babies. Super high demand healer due to the buffs, and good heals.
---
Druid:  Worst healer, no regular rez, takes a special type of person who really likes the lore to play them right.
---
Way ahead and fractionally ahead both amount to the same thing.
---
Thank you for the advertising you done for Tipsout streamer
---
Paladins are easy to level if you have exceptional patience. They are boring beyond boring. Few button presses or decision points, just autoattack for days, and their levelling speed is slow.
---
Rogue is a lot more challenging to level, but it's more fun, so people are more likely to stick with it.
---
As i said you can target friendly totems, but not enemy totems. If you actually watch the video I linked you can see that.
---
That sounds cool!
---
&gt;In regards to the first question I would imagine that layers could be either merged or split depending on under or overpopulation, with relative ease and minimal negative impact. Layers simply provide flexibility to manage the issue more effectively than in previous iterations.
---
It's only purpose is to allow fortnite children to be able to play immediately on launch.
---
It's entirely irrelevant as to what the layers do when it comes to the players being able to log in and play.
---
The relevancy comes in when they remove layering near / at the end of phase 1.
---
Them and everyone like you that assume player dropoff by 50 - 80% is guaranteed by the end of the first phase (weeks after launch) is exactly why there will be servers with 6+ hour queues POST launch.
---
If and when people refuse to transfer to dead or non established servers- what will blizzard to to cater to the fortnite crowd? 
---
Probably reinstate the layers that they oh so promised to remove.
---
But hey I get it, people like you feel the need to "inform people with absolute just"
---
Enjoy your what is sure to be a wonderful summer üëç
---
Won't happen.  Part of what they do during maintenance is network stuff and I'm assuming both will be on the same backbone.
---
Im sorry to break it to you ( since obviously you think you are right), but this is the dumbest thing you could ever say. Its scary to even think, that people like you has any kind of vote for classic wow development. Thats the problem of democracy, people who has no idea about certain things, still get a vote. Look at Brexit or American election lol. Good morning bud
---
Oh my god
---
To be fair, rogues and mages are really rare classes in world of warcraft.
---
This times x100 made.me happy haha
---
Here are my thoughts, and I am no vanilla expert. I‚Äôve decided to roll priest, and had plenty of offers to level with tanks. Being a tank, it‚Äôs more likely you‚Äôll be leading and best to know what‚Äôs in store and if you can manage group while communicating. I‚Äôm thinking healing is probably the easiest aspect of grouping, though I‚Äôm probably wrong. I‚Äôll be happy just to run dungeons only‚Ä¶so it depends what your end game goal is, think long term. Yes it may slow leveling, but you‚Äôll probably spend most of the game at lvl60. So getting free mount as some classes, fast leveling, having a op ability at lvl40 are only short term. Think of being dps/healer/tank at lvl60 will be what you want. Or you can alt later. 
---
I plan to farm fish, cooking and herb, and maybe some AH flipping as holy priest so no need to respec‚Ä¶that will be ample gold for what I‚Äôll need
---
Thank you. Not sure what your talking about but I‚Äôm about a third through oathbringer
---
&gt; Few button presses or decision points
---
As opposed to?
---
Not particularly. Something to note, quite a few of the big name streamers were playing in vanilla. And played on or even still play private servers offstream, so they won‚Äôt exactly get burnt out any faster than a normal person. Hell, the difficulty in leveling and traveling means there won‚Äôt be any large crowds of people there just to follow around their streamer. They‚Äôll either invest the time and effort just like anybody else, or they‚Äôll give up early on. 
---
Additionally I think quite a few major raiding and PvP guilds will be rolling on the same server, so it‚Äôs not like the streamers leaving will depopulate the server they‚Äôre on.
---
I'm not sure how you could come to the conclusion that BFA was the result of listening to the fans. The fans were pretty clear about the core mechanics of BFA not being fun for the entirety of the beta, they were ignored.
---
These are terrible examples and not accurate in portraying the utterly minute differences between sharding and layering. For all intents and purposes, layering does the same shit as sharding does.
---
It's terrible and a bad work around to fixing, or acquiring more powerful, better server infrastructure.
---
More population based around maintenance that lasts what? 2 hours?
---
As far as I have seen, health (and mana) regen on classic beta is way faster than it is supposed to.
---
**FUS RO DAH!**
---
*Firstly, my post needed correction. It's +3% hit, not +3.5%, but here's the correct math.*
---
If the difference between the target's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is **greater than 10**, the formula for miss chance is:
---
    6% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill - 10) * 0.4%
---
A boss is level 63 and Defense Skill is calculated by LEVEL * 5, so a boss has 315 Defense Skill. If you have 300 Weapon Skill, that means:
---
    6% + (315 - 300 - 10) * 0.4% = 8% chance to miss
---
Except we knew this was somehow wrong because people were missing with +8% hit and Blizzard just confirmed why:
---
&gt; The first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear is ignored against monsters with more than 10 Defense Skill above the attacking player's Weapon Skill'
---
**So that means, at 300 Weapon Skill, you chance to miss is actually 9%**
---
Now, if the difference between the target's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is **less than or equal to 10**, the formual for miss chance is:
---
    5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) * 0.1%
---
Which means at 305 Weapon Skill from a Racial bonus, you have:
---
    5% + (315 - 305) * 0.1% = 6%
---
**So the difference to miss between 300 Weapon Skill and 305 Weapon Skill is 3%.**
---
I've definitely seen some fading out action going on beta servers, even players. I think it's on to some degree.
---
For purely solo play your better off with a self sufficient dps class for sure. The problem is grouping is all manual so it can be hard to find groups as a dps character. It's the trade off for self sufficiency.
---
That doesn't make sense.
---
I mean this would be a pretty harmless change, giving them blue. Pink has no connotation to shaman at all! At least the lightning spells are blur
---
Yeah, suuurreee they will...
---
Actually, looking at the algorithms for calulating parry chance here: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_skill
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is less than or equal to 10, your base parry rate is: 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%.
---
this means that between 305 and 315 weapon skill, your chance to be parried goes from 6% to 5%
---
&gt;If the difference between the mob's Defense Skill and your Weapon Skill is greater than 10, your base parry rate will be much higher. Exact figures are not known, but base parry rates of Boss mobs (effectively level 73 when attacked by level 70 players) are estimated to be between 10-15%, and may vary from one Boss to the next.
---
And since the devs have confirmed a mob 3 levels higher has 14% chance to parry, there might actually be 8% parry rate between 300 and 305 weapon skill, which is completely insane. We need to get confirmation from blizzard whether or that 14% is purely down to weapon/defense skill because this mean non-human/orc tanks will on average will be doing nearly 10% less damage without edgemasters, reducing threat and rage by a massive amount. I'm going to start a thread purely for this because it needs to be confirmed by blizzard, i was planning on rolling a dwarf tank but i'm not too sure now if I know I'm going to be doing 10% less damage than a human one unless i pay thousands of gold for edgemasters.
---
I'm not saying the fans asked for BFA. But fans has been requesting QOL that wasnt good for them in the long run. 
---
I mean I remember people being generally happy when LFG was added for example.
---
We just didn't see the long term harm

Alternatively, you have an awkward conversation ahead of you.
---
Should i get banned if im playing a game splitdcreen with my little brother in multiplayer and look at his screen? No, its absurd.
---
Rogues have their own hit issues though because of the dual wielding. Stacking weapon skill may still be important.
---
no better or worse than any other hybrid class tbh.
---
Totally man! And the playerbase on every server is guaranteed to drop off by 70%!!! Making enough room for 1 layer on each setver!
---
Makes sense for the playerbase to drop off 1 month in... especially when there is so much competition...
---
A night elf mohawk? I'm not sure what a night elf warrior is.

Based on the original WOW trial back then , the CLassic Starter Edition might have a more severe limit like max level 10 and only for 1 week

You may find LW to be behind gear you get on your level from dungeons and quests plus all of that gear is BoE so someone other can craft it for you too. And as ele shaman you will often resort to cloth caster gear to get that spell crit and so forth.
---
Small world!
---
It‚Äôs magic
---
i just want to reiterate what you said, MONTHS TO GET RANK 14. depends on your server pop, but with crossrealm BGS and high server expect 12+ hours a day required for rank 14.
---
eh what pet is that ??
---
Ninjas for life.
---
We're talking about sitting in Org looking for a dungeon group.
---
It is 3 pedals. Image is cropped.
---
Me and the missus are having a good time playing BFA while we wait.
---
Have we gotten a number for how many servers there are going to even be by region at launch?
---
&gt;There is some code in 1.12 that explicitly adds a modifier that causes the first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear to be ignored against monsters with more than 10 Defense Skill above the attacking player‚Äôs Weapon Skill.
---
And pservers managed to figure it out just from testing/"gut feeling"? Since I don't think source code of vanilla was ever released?
---
That is amazing in its own right.
---
That not what i reading. What i read is that initial +5 weapon skill make you ignore that "new code" But it's never stated that +5 weapon skill by itself didnt give you some X% hit.
---
What i am implying is that maybe with  +5 weapon kill you will only need 5.5% hit to never miss.
---
Well as most tanks will end up with thunderfury how will axe specialisation help orc tanks?
---
No... it works on a PVP realm too, you just have to be more cautious. We typically do it somewhere remote and have 3 alts inside the raid instance summon the other 37 members who instantly log off. Then after the last 3 raid members are buffed, we kick the alts, and summon the last 3 from our mains and go.
---
Someone who can't google the rank 14 gear won't have the mental fortitude to get to rank 14 anyway.
---
They are really good if you put in a little effort to get some gear
---
Maintenance? I know we're planning classic again but I doubt they'll bring back the day long maintenance.#nochanges üòÇ
---
F&amp;F invites only, so no, unless you know someone at Blizzard.
---
&gt;What's happening is that you're placing a value on what you're doing in Classic because of the time investment you are making. The longer it takes us humans to finish something, the more "pride and accomplishment" we get out of it, and the more value we attribute to it.
---
Well yeah? That's basically what I said. A lot of people place value on that.
---
You are projecting and failing to understand that some of us don't really care about proving how skilled we are in a mythic raid. You are only seeing this from your own point of view of 'this isn't mechanically challenging so it succkss'. 
---
Modern wow is indeed more about skill than gear, which is why they absolutely shower you with it so easily. Some people like this, some people find it boring. 
---
Skyrim isn't an MMO, so don't really know why you're bringing it up. 
---
And no, modern wow raiding isn't too hard for me (or most people if they're willing to put the effort in and practise enough) , I just prefer games like dark souls for that kind of fix, and then when I want a social raiding experience, I'll play classic.
---
These are not ever best-in-slot for any class.
---
It always seemed fun to me that all other classes use magic to buff their teammates and warrior just yells at them ,,to get their shit together".
---
Sry to jump in, but who are these apes? Seen them mentioned alot here.
---
if you want classic WOW experience , you will have to accept day long maintenance like it was back then..
---
They already did. It counts as a single server, so there is one auction house that everyone on each layer uses. Layers are just large partitions of a server.
---
I think the question here is moreso about how you got a paladin into RFC in Vanilla WoW, my dude. That‚Äôs a lot of corpse running.
---
More like Volchan to Lakeshire. Stomping newbies AOE style.
---
First char I got to 60 took me 6 months I kid you not
---
I'm probably gonna level as MM and to hell with mana efficiency. Those Aimed Shot crits are to die for!
---
Thanks for the in depth reply.
---
That didn't answer my question. How will they prevent people from abusing this system especially considering you'll hop in between different layers often when you log in/log out.
---
&gt; More population based around maintenance that lasts what? 2 hours?
---
That's enough time for someone who only plays one to try the other.
---
It's not only about infrastructure. I prefer Layering 100% than playing at launch with 10k people around me.  
---
Once the hype is gone, they can merge all of the sub-worlds and keep it that way for the entire period of Classic.
---
Do you do any digital art, or is it all purely pen and paper?
---
I've done this combo, its fine. I liked it. Only downside is that you end up wanting the same gear. For that reason every other time I duo leveled with someone, I made sure to roll a class that wanted different gear.
---
That's clearly not correct, or you wouldn't be able to see anybody from across the zone.
---
Oh, my bad dude. I forgot you're not allowed to say anything negative about the game here. I'll see myself out before the bad men come get me
---
Was it EU archimonde you played in? because I remember it being merged into dethecus by the time BC rolled

Raid times: New Zealand!, to be decided. (likely in the evening on either Thurs/Fri/Sat night)    
---
Who we are: A bunch of buddies from a long-running New Zealand social discord server who are keen to play Classic together. Some WoW retail veterans, some newbies. I'm an experienced ex-raid leader who has played every retail expansion and ran multiple successful guilds.  
---
Our vision: a competent yet semi-casual PvE and world PVP guild, putting fun, friendship and fully immersing ourselves in the game as priority, with efficient grinding min/maxing and lack of sleep being optional!   
---
We intend to stay small enough to retain a close-knit identity, while also raiding with a sister guild to down 40man content. 
---
What sets us apart:  -  
---
We have an awesome active social discord and do regular meetups in real life all over New Zealand!     
---
\-We will allow people to raid as any spec/race/class, including sub-optimal ones (within reason) Yes - you can raid as ret or boomkin and we will gear you (eventually...)!    
---
 \-We are also looking for experienced people to be our officers and help lead the guild - you could be part of something new and great! Until classic releases our discord server is going to be for general/social discussion.

Come introduce yourself! [https://discord.gg/qrSbGRq](https://discord.gg/qrSbGRq)
---
They aren't going to prevent it, the expectation is by the time it would begin to be actually detrimental is when they'd have removed layering. 
---
You're not going to hop into a different layer by logging out that isn't how it works.
---
Horde it is then
---
You miss the point, idiot. There's going to be certain people that hit high lvl quicker and take advantage of this. If you think otherwise you're an imbecile. Giving farms 3-6x the nodes is a horrible idea and will cause problems for the economies of these "layers."
---
Mr. T?
---
Personally, I think having Classic be objectively as close as possible to Vanilla 1.12 is better than letting some developer change it based on their subjective feelings.
---
I don't think it will matter much for the AH as layering won't be in the game when people are farming end-game mats. Who cares if someone can hop a layer and get some extra tin? No one will have the spare change to buy that extra tin off the AH. Sure, they might lvl their profession a little faster in those first few weeks but it's not going to be any different than someone full on no-lifing those first few weeks.
---
You are over thinking it. Layers are just a portion of a server. You are stuck on that layer when you create a character unless you "manually" change it by joining a group or guild on a different layer. I'm sure rare drops are on a server wide basis and not a layer wide basis. AHs are server wide but I doubt there will be over saturation since all items come from one server.
---
Shield bash and revenge are all level 20 or less abilities. Both of which should be used before sunder.
---
Are you aware that pets will mostly die in raids and that blood fury only gives you melee ap, not ranged ap? I think troll is still better because berserking is a consistent dps cooldown that helps your ranged damage.
---
According to data gathered on beta +5 weapon skill is +2% hit not +3% like on pservers.
---
Some people are going to be toxic, you can't really prevent it. On private servers its worse because there aren't any consequences to those actions, not really. Even if you managed to get your account banned on a pserver, oh well, you were going to quit in a few months to play Classic anyway.
---
Not all the time but if a particular layer is full then yes you will be transferred to another layer with lower population. Also you'll have to be able to switch layers to play with your friends, that's another way people could exploit this AH situation.
---
Doesn't seem to be the case that +5 weapon skill reduces parry
---
 [https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5)
---
How though?
---
Strange. The pserver I‚Äôve been trying out, at lvl40 and haven‚Äôt had a fight yet with the opposite faction‚Ä¶usually we ignore each other and cruise on by. Only close pvp encounter was an ally standing next to me when I had multiple mobs. He didn‚Äôt have to lift a finger‚Ä¶it was my panicked flee that got me killed.
---
Ya
---
Honestly, I'm not totally sure we can.  The best we can do is get names around, in game, and not group with them.  It isn't the greatest solution, but it should help in stopping it from spreading.  If they can't group, and they know why they're not getting groups, it may help dissuade some of the behavior as well.
---
That's a fair point. If we are to believe [this poster](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Miss?oldid=356356) on wiki which has been [theorized](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bumoii/blue_post_confirms_8_melee_hit_cap_vs_raid_bosses/ephpqyc/) to be a Blizzard employee, then the hitcap for 305 skill vs lvl 63 mobs would be 6%, as the +5 weapon skill would still give additional hit on top of cancelling out the "1% hit ignored" rule.
---
There for sure ways to layer-hop, logging out just isn't one of them. Its definitely exploitable, I'm sure some people will do just that. 
---
Basically Blizzard's stance is the amount of damage that will be caused by people exploiting layering is less than the amount of damage that will be caused by having extra servers to avoid layering because a lot of those servers would just be low population dead servers.
---
Its a short term problem for a long-term solution.
---
Well it would require two accounts in Classic on pvp realms.
---
Im rolling Orc and my leveling friend isnt free from work until the day after launch, so i'll spend the first day setting up my professions. So doing some quests for the gold, then running to Org/Razor Hill to pick up the professions/Flight path.
---
Definitely googled it. Just wasn‚Äôt sure how it compared to other shaman BiS until AQ 40. But thanks for the snide comment.
---
While the community aspect of WoW in vanilla was great, it sure was still toxic as fuck. This isn't something isolated to private servers, and it will once again be a part of vanilla, as it has always been.
---
Threat meter addon is really useful and basically must
---
Bagnon and auctioneer are must haves for me.
---
Shouldnt it be 1% crit chance since its 1% reduction per level , so 1% per 5 weapon skill?
---
Get a swing timer addon, a slow 2hander ASAP, and practise Hamstring kiting.
---
Pull a mob, Hamstraing, run away, wait for swing timer to almost reset, run back to mob, auto attack, rend. Repeat.
---
This will greatly reduce the amount of mob damage you take in the early levels instead of standing there tanking the fast hits they put out.
---
Not quite, pservers just added a 1% hit on the cap to account for the difference
---
You can put it to 2%. Let me grab the link from beta.
---
I like the character name you got there üòè
---
1.12 is classic easy mode but that's the world we live in.
---
Tirion Fordring questline is the best
---
\&gt; minus 8.0% to-be-parried 
---
?
---
We won't and we can't. The best hope is that they will become an even smaller proportional minority when classic goes live and that server reputation will be a thing again.
---
On private servers the constant lack of able bodies kind of forces you to accept 'less than desirable' behavior. If classic goes as it should, we should have thriving communities and a steady supply of people. With this, you can leverage social stigma into a tool to counter toxic behavior. It wouldn't be perfect, but the more you can diminish the toxic player groups, the better.
---
That question was made from the dawn of online gaming . The short answer is: you can‚Äôt regulate it. 
---
Even with chat disabled, people will find ways to show you how discontent are. 
---
IMO two major factors that reduce toxicity are: 
---
1) The game has a subscription fee and you need to buy a copy of it in order to play. That will make some people double think before they start talking/throwing shit. Ofc that doesn‚Äôt solve the problem, but it does reduce it. 
---
2) Player maturity and age. That‚Äôs a huge factor. Try to surround yourself with people that have the same scope for the game as you. 
---
Usually toxicity is being produced by the feeling that someone in your group isn‚Äôt really trying or their/his/her skill levels are way below yours. 
---
As the online gaming culture keeps progressive forward, more and more younger people will realise that‚Äôs in their own benefit to be kinder and more coolheaded when teaming up with others. Don‚Äôt forget, online gaming is around for around 25 years, still in infancy - we have a long way to go.
---
Hunters are essentially the gods of solo play, as they are by far the strongest solo PvE class (able to solo mobs that might normally take 2 players 30 of other classes to beat) they smash everyone until lvl60, and are also one of the strongest solo/world PvP classes... They are monsters early game, until lvl60 as they dont scale aswell with their armor like the other classes.. But they are still just as good in PvP, it's just now you actually have to try, which seperates good hunters from bad hunters (as their the most difficult class to master)..
---
I like the art style - reminiscent of old school King's Quest or other 80s adventure games
---
You're on Reddit.  You must be pretty handy with computers!
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I assumed. Thank you for the help. 
---
And yes I‚Äôm very aware of the rank 14 grind. I got rank 12 during vanilla but didn‚Äôt push GM b/c of highschool. Now I‚Äôm an adult with endless free time so I think I‚Äôll finish what I couldn‚Äôt back then.
---
Subbed on both my accounts.
---
I hate that, because I want to read and see everything while doing it first time on my main:/
---
Do you have link or a streamer / clip of this info? first time hearing this
---
probably worse judging by 15 years of wow experience, tbh.
---
You're right, I never realized that before but I love the aesthetics of those games so it probably influenced the choice. In fact, I just noticed the headpiece is actually the same one used by [this grossly incandescent easter egg.](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=112958/soulare-of-andorhal)
---
I love how Venruki was running for his life from Cdew melee range, like was a raid boss.
---
thanks that is one I forgot :)
---
Hey that‚Äôs actually accurate according to data being gathered.
---
I've hear differently. Layers will have caps, so if you log out of layer 5 and then log back in 3 hours later and layer 5 is full, you'll be move to another layer. Also people will absolutely take advantage of changing layers if all you have to do is join a group with someone else. 
---
 "I'm sure rare drops are on a server wide basis and not a layer wide basis." - How would this be the case? That would be unfair for certain layers because the drop rates would be insanely low if that's the case. I'm almost certain they wont do that. I predict each layer will act as it's own server in terms of drop rates/node spawn times.

Yes, if by "very close" you mean, "very distant." They're second best, for sure, but it's not close.

[Here](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5)
---
You'll need 5% HIT against lvl 60 and 8% HIT against lvl 63 (raid bosses) to not miss with a 2 hander.
---
What you could do to avoid dual wiled miss rate but get the speed is just equip a fast dagger in your main hand (nothing in your left hand) and spam raptor strike. You might get OOM fast though, innervate is your friend (you should have a few boomkins in your raid I guess :D ).
---
For the race choice I don't think they matter for tanking. But let's be frank : there's a big chance you'll tank a few times to satiate your desire for originality, but it will get old really fast and then you'll have to be a real hunter. I would make my race choice considering that.
---
I played ele shaman in vanilla, with MC/a little BWL gear, and on a private server with just some pre-raid bis gear, and both times I did just fine. Shamans have a lot of utility and options to help you out.
---
Also their damage isn't trash in raids, don't just believe what people say about vanilla. The skill floor is much higher now and we understand stats and ear better now, so with knowledge of fights and how long they'll last and some use of downranking spells you can do okay dps in raids. Likely won't be topping the meters but you don't really need to unless you're doing cutting edge raiding in AQ40 and Naxx. If you're not downing bosses it isn't cause you brought an ele shaman instead of a lock/mage/rogue/whatever.
---
People trying to pigeon hole classes into certain specs and roles will only hurt the game. We need to be more accepting with these off-meta builds and specs, it'll make the game more fun and interesting.

Whatever you think is right.
---
I don‚Äôt have the willpower to not kill...
---
I mean I hope this is the case, I really do but I'm skeptical. I haven't found any hard date about when they're going to shut down layering. Just some vague stuff about "hopefully it's gone after a few weeks" and "it'll will definitely be gone before phase 2" If it only lasts for 2-3 weeks then it's not too big of a deal but I'm not sure that will actually happen especially if the population doesn't drop the way Blizzard thinks it will after a little while.
---
Depends on the context. Leveling you shouldn't respec and can probably do both, but at 60 you should pick one. Druid solo even in resto shouldn't be bad for farming.
---
I didn't even get to stress test **üòÇü§£**
---
Running around in Ghost Wolf form nipping at the heels of lowbie Alliance players. I wouldn't kill them, unless Winfury went off.
---
I don't think it works like this on private servers. I think they assume an universal 8.6% hit cap? Or something thereabouts. This blueposts throws everything the players knew about vanilla hitcap out the window, pretty much.
---
FYI - There are not keys. Your B.net account is just flagged.
---
1. the comment section clarifies that this is indeed Vanilla "not tbc"
---
2. if it was tbc then why does he not have a single tbc talent active, not to mention TBC nerfs the book in question...
---
3. if we assume it was tbc he would at most with whats shown be able tohit for 550-620, and that is assuming the imp breaks the norms of spell coef's and gains 100% scaling.....
---
So no-matter how it is twisted and turned it does not make sense to me, unless the pet benefits from its masters stats or from its ap or something else.
---
Gaming asways has been "toxic" in the eyes of some people. I never had issues with toxicity. 
---
But my worce experience with toxicity was in retail. I Joined a LFR G'huun group.
---
For those that have not played Retail wow in a while LFR is a raid difficulty that is doable by the worce kind of players. There is zero skill needed.
---
There was 1 mechanic that has to be done, just 1. But you needed 2 guys for it. Out of the group of 30 man. It took me 5 minutes to whisper everyone asking them to help me with the mechanic. NO ONE BATS AN EYE! Serieusly NO ONE awnsered.
---
In my eyes toxicity is being quite in a game where co-operation is recuired. There solo mentallity has no place in an MMO. If you are the issue and you are pointed out on it ( without rage but by nice words and friendly reminders ). And you still don't want to adapt to the needs of the group. Thats being toxic imo.
---
I would love to argue more about toxicity, what it is, how to avoid it and how to not be it unintencially.
---
/u/ebbnflowdnt, you almost made it right at the end, there!
---
Preparing to stomp some fools with my NIGHT ELF MOHAWK!
---
I think sharding in lower level (1-20) zones would be a better fix honestly. I'm uneasy about this whole world wide layering idea.
---
Horde has windfury which heavily favours swords.
---
I'm still not sure this is correct, since Blizzard stated that it was a modifier that led to a 9% miss chance with a 300 Weapon Skill, meaning without the modifier, a character with a 300 Weapon Skill should have a 8% miss chance against a level 63 with 315 Defense Skill
---
If the formula was instead:  
---
5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) * 0.2%  
---
This would lead to:  
---
5% + (315 - 300) * 0.2% = 8%  
---
The modifier would then be applied, causing the first 1% hit chance to be ignored, leading to a 9% miss chance.
---
If that were true, then a character with 305 Weapon Skill would result:  
---
5% + (315 - 305) * 0.2% = 7%  
---
Meaning there would be a 2% difference in miss chance and hit required to negate that miss chance.
---
Interesting, I didn‚Äôt play much vanilla Hunter (late vanilla &gt; TBC but I don‚Äôt recall the pet bar ever prioritizing abilities during my time on Hunter.
---
Does anyone know if you will be able to use the collectors edition code for the pets in classic wow.
---
(Sorry if this has already been answered, i'm new here)
---
RemindMe! 85 days
---
Pirate servers are not a great representation of the wow player base.
---
Thanks :-)
---
When I started playing at the end of Vanilla, I played a dps (Night elf hunter)
---
I kept playing that till Wrath, where I re speced a Frost dk, I kept playing that and really liked the armour and play type but couldn‚Äôt figure out why. I then kept playing that till Legion, where I picked up a Destro Warlock, I loved that a lot, I only do PVE and a lot of dungeons, but at the very end of Legion I got mad cause a lot of tanks were annoying, so I picked up a Warrior, and it was the most fun I ever had, and I found the reason why I liked the big armour, was because that meant I had to be close to the enemy, and had a real risk and that‚Äôs why I liked the game. When I played hunter and warlock, I felt no risk because my pet took the taunt from me and in legion and etc tanking is so easy so I had no threat.
---
so this time around I‚Äôm rolling a warrior off the start, and tanking.
---
To;dr played ranged dps throughout wow, no risk involved, played a charter with risk, loved it, excited to play with even more risk in classic
---
And you can just make a new one. There is more incentive to not be a dickbag as you are paying money for the service.
---
Sharding low level zones doesn't solve the problem that Blizzard wants to fix, which is preventing some servers from being dead or very low population months from now.
---
Layering allows them to have servers within one server. Once the population on those layers die down, they can merge the layers and have one decent sized server. As opposed to having one good server, and two dead ones.
---
&gt; Wasnt the problem to begin with that they were listening to the fans?
---
There's always groups asking for more and less of everything. Some people ask for more QoL features, some ask for less. Some think LFR and LFD are great and should be expanded, some think they should be removed. Some think sharding is the salvation of low-pop servers, some think it's the death of server community.
---
If you cherry pick, every bad decision in BFA was asked for by the community, but that ignores the groups that asked for literally the exact opposite.
---
No. They've already stated they won't be running two MMO so balance patches are out of the question.
---
Thank you for bringing clarity on the matter.
---
Is Westfall an erect penis?
---
Gettin rank 14 is something that you think you do, but you don't.
---
Or you can stop being so sensitive.
---
Retail WoW still has the xp boost though
---
The game is not out yet, but you're already whining on class balance ... #nochanges I guess ?
---
That's a big mistake for certain aspects of the game. Hopefully as time goes on they reconsider this.
---
I assume orbs. Those can be Solo‚Äôd with the right class. Even on normal...
---
That's cool, you had a Night Elf rogue named Mirah! I wonder if she ever got her weapon, Mirah's Song :) [https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15806) 
---
It's pretty strong and easy to get (maybe not back then)
---
No fun
---
No
---
Not whining kid. Pointing out that they didnt create untouchable perfect gold back then and am just wondering if they are open to adjustments for the good of the game.
---
It's up to each of us individually to put in the effort, to craft that Community, we build it. It will always be jerk faces, this is inevitable, and it is up to us to single them out and block them. Our experience and our community is what we make it.
---
I hope you'll reconsider not playing Classic.
---
I can see a patch following release a few weeks out just to hammer out any big issues but yeah, like the other guy said, no core features will get updates
---
Nah. Won‚Äôt happen.
---
Does it count for low level 1-10 quests as well?
---
Anyone working at blizzard wants to be friends with me?
---
Yeah What ever, I have Beta ans they not so :D
---
May the Dark Lady watch over you
---
Which aspects? The same situation happened in starcraft and it works perfectly well imbalanced.
---
Just for you? Sure.... Hahaha fuck off son. It's a question about 1 aspect of the game that was undeniable not perfect.
---
They don't know. Basically both the player base and Blizzard devs are unsure whether they're going to go down the TBC/WotLK Classic server route, or make new content for Classic WoW and with all the design philosophies of vanilla WoW.
---
If its the latter, then you probably will see class balance changes at some point. 
---
However, that won't be for at least 2.5 years from now. I wouldn't worry to hard about class balance. You'll either get TBC which has better class balance, or you'll get post Naxx content which would eventually introduce class balance challenges.
---
The level cap should be 40, so we can actually test all talents.
---
To be able to edit it I've actually had to remove the original map and basically slap a different one ontop, remake all the text and also edit some text out from behind it.
---
Edits I've made:
---
[Map with only zone names](https://i.imgur.com/m94wHU5.jpg)
---
[Map with only continential names](https://i.imgur.com/4DC7FpX.jpg)
---
[Map without any names](https://i.imgur.com/ke5UZOL.jpg)
---
Same I ressubed after 9 years.
---
Yes. But Im not the right class.
---
People should activity trying to contribute for the stuff they signed up for. The "slack till others complete it" additude is so toxic. 
---
Just because it can be solo'd on certain classes wich I was not ofc. That not a reason to do nothing. 29/30 people litterly did nothing. Expecting to get rewarded for it.
---
I recommend you play a healer or a tank because regardless if you‚Äôre a dedicated raider or not, every instance needs two things, tanks and healers. DPS are a dime a dozen.
---
Why not wait for the game to find out and test it? Not everything information about game mechanics has to be provided right away.
---
/cast auto shot
---
Then you miss the point of Classic, it wasn't perfect.
---
thanks. Great additions for my list :)
---
That is by the way one of the main reasons I would like to play Beta lol. To setup all the addons to be ready for release :D takes at least half an hour.
---
Just wait for TBC.  Not much you can complain about for TBC class balance.  Then both sides get what they want.
---
I gave an example of a couple things pertaining to hunters in the post. The game will certainly still be fun. I never said it wouldn't be great and wouldn't work.
---
In terms of leveling speed warriors are generally quicker than paladins, especially when we can't abuse reckoning on classic.
---
Thanks for replying like an adult :)
---
I leveled a warrior as my first 60..
---
It felt like every monster my level was a life and death battle. Two was instant death.
---
Granted it was my first character ever, but I remember the 40's being the absolute worst chunk.
---
Damn, RIP arcane mage :X, ou well.
---
Playing as a solo DPS it will be even more important to cultivate your reputation as considerate, adept, if you want to be one of the people who when they log on, instantly get several Whispers asking if you want to make a group.
---
That was not the point of classic.
---
Rogues are a blast, esp if you love to troll. 
---
I never played a warrior in classic, and only pally in tbc. 
---
You will find the most enjoyment from classic, if you find 2 friends. 
---
1 plate, 1 dps, 1 heal ( can all be dps. But have those abilities )
---
Getting a cool proc melee weapon was a blast! There are some that legitimately have use in high end raiding for special debuffs and some that add a cool randomness to fighting. Overall I remember being more excited about upgrading melee gear because of the martial classes being so dependent on the dps to quest and kill things.
---
No bug. Then you're just standing too close and the hit boxes overlap too much. In this way you can even hit someone who's behind you.
---
Its sometimes good to keep this information to yourself and benefit from it
---
No changes. You can balance everything out in Bfa and play that.. Its the same subscription anyway.
---
Why has to be ever single day a whining/balancing thread and a "I want to add this QoL changee to Classic". Classic is a "as close as possible replica" of vanilla, its not a hard concept to undertand.
---
I can only hope that the Classic development team can 'withstand' the hordes or these people. Their number increased significantly recently...
---
Well he worked for the IRS.
---
10 hours per level, what are you doing that waste so much time? (honest question) :o
---
I mean that‚Äôs kinda just lfr has been for a few compacts
---
Yoooooooooooooo this right here!!!!!!!
---
"Once the population on those layers die down, they can merge the layers and have one perfect sized server." - What if the population doesn't die down the way they think it will? Will they just merge the layers together and form a server with 15,000 - 20,000 thousand people on it or something absurd like that? The ques (which they claim to want to avoid) will be massive.
---
I wouldn't recommend the HWL grind to anyone. Getting ranks 11-13 can be time-consuming, but 13-14 is its own thing. You'll likely be ranking against people who can have friends (or even their children) play the game for them while they're sleeping. To reach 14, you'll need to beat those people in multi-week contest of who can sit at their PC for the longest time. I hope you have kids.
---
Source for minus 8% to be parried?  Or basically everything you state.
---
How does this math out for weapon skill and chance to crit?
---
Doesn‚Äôt he have like... 50k subs?  Between donations and a little bit of advice revenue, plus his YouTube channel, i can see it hitting into 7!fogures.
---
Had me giggling at work, beautiful stuff
---
We know they didn‚Äôt make a perfect game back then. We all understand that. But we love the game as it was back then. I love druids and I‚Äôm not gonna be able to raid with them and be the best player on the server. But I love the game, even though it‚Äôs not perfect.
---
I don‚Äôt want them to balance anything. I wanna play the game and immerse myself in it and try to be the best with every class.
---
Not saying they can't handle all content just fine, but a non-prot tank is either going to be a considerably worse tank than a feral druid, do less damage than the feral druid, or both. The feral off-tank can go cat form until he needs to tank and the aspect of the pack buff is quite strong.
---
So I might get downvoted here, but doesn‚Äôt crit rating not exist in vanilla? If I remember correctly all the items that give crit just give a flat percentage like 1% crit
---
Yes he‚Äôs a douchebag
---
She's still in business. I sell her junk pretty often as she is the closest vendor to the the AH in Org.
---
Would buy if someone hand painted this.
---
Gotta position and micro that pet
---
This is actually what I suspected. I actually kind of hope for a TBC server eventually because it's a way better slate for them to make a great pvp game. But if they want to keep it to 60 then I actually cannot imagine the game ever getting to a point of being out for say 3 years and for people in the pvp community to not hound them to change small things. At the end of day weather viper sting gets a cooldown or freeze trap gets put on 1 or 2 classes pvp trinkets certainly isn't going to make or break the entire game. Even the people sitting here saying NO CHANGES! will get to a certain point in the game where they realise they are wrong.
---
Let me check but I don't believe so
---
Don't forget that the Barrens is where a lot of kids with a severe lack of parenting gravitate.
---
They'll never reach lvl 60 (hopefully :D ).
---
A lot of things you see in low lvl instances won't be at high lvl.
---
As a priest I had a warrior tank refuse to put a shield in SM, but it never happened at high level : those people either adapted or quit the game.
---
There still will be toxic players at lvl 60, but your ignore list is there for this sole reason (I just hope they make it bigger than 10 or 20 names).
---
As long as your guild is cool, I don't see any reason to worry, the majority of your interactions will be with guildies, and you will meet plenty of cool people outside too.
---
No you‚Äôre just an idiot üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
The way I interpreted it, they basically said that at 300/300 skill vs 315/315 defense, hit cap is 9%.
---
At 305/305 vs 315/315 the hit cap is 8%.
---
You mean vanilla but I get you. It's hard to comprehend that they are making it how people wanted it to be.
---
Their imbalance is itself balanced. It's just like I said above, starcraft is really imbalanced but also completely balanced because of it. It forces a very specific playstyle but that is what makes the game good. Classic isn't perfect but that is its perfection. You can plan how to play because it won't change.
---
1% is still within the error ranges, so I think I'll wait for more data :)
---
You havent been fighting for classic, kiddo. 
---
#NoChanges.
---
Looks like an Azeroth leisure suit Larry adventure
---
Is Vorosh still playing/leading?
---
They're tied to your Blizzard account, so I would assume you can.
---
Liar pants on fire! Lol.
---
I'd argue that rogues are the worst since they don't have any hamstring like strategies, no sustain, and only use leather. Besides that, paladins are extremely painful..... Talk about a grind, sheesh.
---
Just grind mobs in a remote corner of the zone, nobody will bother corpse camping you.
---
Frankly I'm surprised by the number of severe bugs found in this beta.
---
I thought in 2 years they had ironed the major bugs and just needed a public beta for show and find a few well hidden bugs.
---
But don't tell me they didn't see the problem with hunters and warlocks pets before releasing the beta (especially since it's a known bug in retail for moire than 2 years) ?!
---
This bug list looks more what you would find in a closed beta imo, I'm not sure the game will be ready for the release date.
---
There is no crit rating just flat % increases. Crit rating was introduced in TBC
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5 heres some data from the beta and heres the post https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwjtf7/hit_cap_in_classic_has_been_clarified/
---
Free loot handouts is just bad game design. But expecting to get carried is there own bad additude.
---
Except we know through all the data parsing that the formula for miss change isn't the same between &gt;10 skill difference and &lt;=10 skill difference. It's been tested to death, at every level, at every mob level, with every +skill piece of gear and every +skill talent.
---
We even knew the base miss chance was closer to 9% instead of the calculated 8%, we just didn't know *why*.
---
Oh okay, thank you
---
Should be fairly easy to test out in the beta though, just need someone with access that is willing to spend a lot of time gathering the proper amount of data.
---
First as a dwarf then as a human (or troll then orc if dat's what you into mon).
---
&gt; "resub 2 weeks in advance to reserve a name for no reason" stuff is slimy.
---
You can reserve names if you re-sub 2 weeks beforehand?
---
Now that's a real hunter weapon !
---
Because people will be rolling characters on day 1 and they'll be sinking hundreds of hours into leveling that character to 60. I don't want to find out halfway through that I'm stuck with a race choice that's going to perform 10 or 15% worse than another, I don't think any other class/role is so dramatically impacted by race choice. As I always understood the difference in tank races equated to something like 5% difference in damage, that wasn't enough to worry me. I could work around that, but 10-15% is starting to get into serious disadvantage territory.
---
Don‚Äôt disagree there. Just how it goes though. Lfr was like that with the last few raids and xpacs. It‚Äôs only more noticeable when there are mechanics that have to be done in lfr which isn‚Äôt too common, although I think lately they have been adding at least one per raid.
---
Well actually no playing BFA is something entirely different and an extremely shitty experience and what they've said is that they will listen to the demands of the community. If it gets to a point where the vast majority of the pvp community has made it abundantly clear that something is completely broken, then they should approach it with the same design philosophy of balance changes made back then. Because it's what the community would have wanted. 
---
This isn't a whining balance thread it was just a question. I specifically stated the game would still be good and fun. You might have noticed that if you weren't looking for an opportunity to jump at for your own excessive whining.
---
From memory paladin auras do affect pets (hunter pets at least). As far as furious howl goes I never actually tested it but I imagine it would if they are in range.
---
Are you playing alliance?
---
For real this time !
---
Looks great! At a glance the only thing I spotted was Hyjal is spelled incorrectly as Hyial.
---
We all love the state of the game back then but it wasn't the balance changes across vanilla that ruined the game. But its entirely possible for them to introduce different mechanics for abilities in pvp situations than to raids. If there's any particular raid that for what ever reason needs viper sting to be on 0 cooldown, its easy for them to program that into pve and apply a cooldown to pvp. 
---
Weather viper sting for example has a cooldown or not is certainly not the maker or breaker of what makes classic wow an amazing game.
---
Eh, pservers are off. Shouldn‚Äôt really be a surprise. Not like this would be the only thing they are off on. Rep rewards are increased by like 200% on em.
---
There he is... the one and only...
---
Gratz on becoming the first infamous troll. The biggest asshole of them all. The one who reached for the stars and made it.
---
We all hate you, but there will be songs written about you.
---
And a legacy has been born...
---
/slowclap
---
So adults think they will implement changes? I bet the majority of players were adults at vanilla and want no changes.
---
This is the most ignorant reply I‚Äôve ever seen on this sub, and that‚Äôs saying something.
---
This might be a stupid question, but is 9% the hitcap for spells as well?
---
It would be really cool if Blizzard re-released this for Classic launch. Kinda like they are doing with the 15th Anniversary set. No game, but all the same stuff inside along with a code for the pets.
---
Exactly the kind of childish stupidity I expected to have to wade through for solid answers from few good members of the community :)
---
They are now.
---
I am not subbed and have been part of both stress tests and still have it in my bnet. Probably do not have to stay subbed for those!
---
Base Crit Chance and Weapon Skill is:
---
    5% - (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill) * 0.04%
---
So every 1 Weapon Skill is worth 0.04% chance to Crit, making +5 Weapon Skill worth +0.2% chance to Crit.
---
Everyone is free to be whoever they want to be.
---
Everyone is free to hate whoever they want.
---
And Im here sitting and laughing at the commotion.
---
I will actively work to increase hostility and toxicity. I miss the internet in 2004 and boy was it toxic then. The difference is that today people actually cant handle a mean word without breaking down. It's pathetic.
---
It is a closed beta.
---
Nah, nothing so far. We're all just waiting for more info.
---
Is this Statement related to the most recent wave? Because i got an invite on day 3 of beta and im Not a Streamer in any shape or Form nor have got friends and/or Family at Blizzard.
---
I disagree.
---
&gt;  It reassures me to see that theres parts of the code that even they didn't realise were there, because that means suggests they're directly porting it rather than just trying to reverse engineer it.
---
Was that ever in doubt? They said they have a reference 1.12 client/server running internally. They have all the code going back to Warcraft 3. They only lost the *data* (well, up to 1.12, which was fortunately recovered from a backup).
---
;)
---
There are some weapons with interesting effects. Hand of Edward the Odd is pretty cool for ret paladins and maybe shamans too. It doesn't do a lot of damage but the proc rate is pretty high and allows you to get instant cast heals off. Very nice for duelling. There is also a mace which name escapes me that has a mana regen proc, pretty useful for paladin tanks. 
---
There's also some quirks like Misplaced Servo Arm's proc not being chance on hit, which means feral druids can use it in PvP and with their really fast attack speed it procs constantly and hurts a lot.    
---
Speaking of feral druids, there's a blue mace from Gnomeregan called Manual Crowd Pummeler. It's a level 29 two-hander with some really quite decent stats at that level. Even at 60 it's not terrible. It has a use effect that increases your attack speed by a whopping 50% for 30 seconds. The catch is however that the weapon damage is of course really low compared to 60 weapons, so for warriors it's not all that useful. But feral druids don't use the weapon damage, they have "natural" weapons. So they can equip this mace and essentially have a 50% attack speed buff which is mental. A bear with this mace will outthreat big G himself and a cat can probably compete for top 5 spots, search Youtube for a kitty called Shedo.
---
Ironfoe of course is a nice weapon. Both for tanks and dps, it gives you extra attacks which combined with the Hand of Justice trinket that does the same thing you can suddenly get a huge burst off. Now slap windfury on it and whenever RNGesus takes the wheel you'll just outright one-shot someone from your extra attacks. 
---
I have to mention Nightfall as well. Most seem to associate Nightfall with the warlock talent that gives you instant shadowballs, but it's also a nice 2-handed axe. Its chance on hit is to debuff the target with 15% extra spell damage taken. You can imagine all the caster dps screaming for multiple Nightfalls in the raid. On private servers it seems to proc from seals as well as attacks so there are quite a few rets sporting this axe in raids. We'll see how that will be on Classic.
---
The skill floor is crazy low so its not a bad idea.
---
I really hope somebody can. I'd be happy if somebody could get equally geared characters of different races wail on +3 level mobs for a while to see how much difference comes up.
---
The only place there the line thruly fits.
---
Getting rank14 is nothing but suffering.
---
Sounds like you just wanna play a mana user and hate hunters.
---
Pushing rank 14...dude this is not BFA....Get real son!
---
Luckily as of now Blizzard isn't on your side of the argument. Try a pirate server, they change things.
---
PVP servers are much more immersive. 
---
Questing as a lowbie with the fear of getting ganked adds a lot to the experience.
---
I can understand how some easily frustrated people would not be into it though.
---

Keep acting high and mighty, you literally have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about AND made this post just for the attention, like a child. Which you are üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
It's not going to be that big a difference, and even if it was it doesn't really matter all that much since all the content is very easy.
---
Just the most recent ones.

just another streamer e-drama circlejerk.

this sub is garbage.

Bait with the meat store sign, when its fruit
---
Sure have son. You have nooooo idea about me.
---
Thanks! I really love the Souls series. I honestly had no idea that that existed LMAO it's amazing
---
Bow spec and gun spec account for bonus crit from weapon skill. So the effect is somewhat similar to the gnome racial for mages.
---
Perhaps items such as black lotus and other valuable consumables/materials will exist singularly on the server. That means, for example, if someone who is on layer 1 picks up the black lotus that spawns in Tyrs hand then it will despawn for all layers on the server. But then again thats speculation on my part.
---
You‚Äôll miss out sometimes but most the time it will benefit you. A good hunter will be top damage in a leveling dungeon, won‚Äôt ninja, and will share boss loot kills for quests.
---
What i wish to know is what happens in classic, memory &amp; other things won't affect classic unless there is evidence that forces blizzard to change something, so what i am trying to do is to ask a warlock to group with a paladin and see what happens, next a hunter with wolf and a warlock with pet out.
---
:)
---
On the horde side it doesn't matter that much because of Thunderfury. On the alliance side on the other hand it's a big deal.
---
I‚Äôm a mage and I never lose to a hunters. Things are okay as long as you pick the master class ;).  I suggest you go warlock
---
Actually I main Hunter and Warrior rofl.
---
After looking through the data, the parry chance is still around 14% regardless of weapon skill, ive edited the post. Humans and orcs are not as OP as I thought just a minute ago
---
Streamers such as Grubby have heard nothing about reforged practically since it was announced. It is possible he is under a NDA, but he seems doubtful about reforge release being anytime soon. 
---
Blizzard may blindside everyone and release it without much warning, but I doubt the game will be released without testing with high level/pro gamer involvement. Grubby was included in Blizzcon for the announcement of it, so I‚Äôd heavily expect he‚Äôd be in any testing
---
&gt; If that were true, then a character with 305 Weapon Skill would result:  
---
&gt; 5% + (315 - 305) * 0.2% = 7%  
---
&gt; Meaning there would be a 2% difference in miss chance and hit required to negate that miss chance.
---
The thing is, you've missed the part where the *0.2 modifier is only used when the difference between weapon skill and defence is over 10. It's a *0.1 modifier at 10 and below, which is where that extra 1% comes from.
---
Going up to 305 weapon skill puts you in that "10 or below" bracket.
---
I lvl'd on Vanilla PvP server as horde..  indeed ganking will cost you HUGE ammount of time if your not carefull. Zones like Ashenvale, Tanaris Stranglethorn will be crowded and hard to lvl in. Its best to stick close to other members of your faction and check if a spot is safe first. You can use general chat to ask if the Alliance is dominanting an Area. When you top 50; Most of these problems will go away as your not that vurnable anymore and zones are less populated.
---
Kalimdor will most likely be the Safest continent and I recommend that during peek times you do like a dungeon or other stuff. And go for the hit spots quest either early or late at night. 
---
Join a guild around your lvl. Stick to eachother and if a max lvl60 shows up. Go for a shit and drink. He wont wait 15min for nothing, he will wait if you keep respawning and /chicken
---
Yes the private server community is extremely toxic. The beta on the other hand is almost a polar opposite and it has a lot to do with how few private server players have gained access.
---
The best we can do is figure out which servers they'll be flocking to and avoid those like the plague.
---
That is not my experience so far. I constantly see hunters stealing weapons and int items. They have decent dps lower lvl dungeons though but thats about it. 
---
Also in general so many of them are toxic. My rogue alt just now got kicked from meeting stone because hunter said i would "need" his items". I have been with 3 clothers and nobody complained.
---
The layering itself isn't a bad idea but the ability to switch in between is awful. Something like this would be fine
---
Anathema
---
layer 1
---
layer 2
---
layer 3
---
Each layer is static and has a cap. After 1 to 2 months you merge the layers and create one server. The only downside is there will inevitably be ques not matter what they do unless they keep layering for a looong time.
---
[They already did](https://youtu.be/rUPzu5McOE0)
---
That's only spelled that way in the original image you see above, that's the one I didn't make and it has several spelling mistakes I've tried to fix in the better version.
---
Fuck man. You got me. Im the one acting high and mighty with no clue. Proposing a polite question with factual statements and getting a response from a useless little cock head like yourself that doesn't address anything about balance and why commonly perceived imbalances are infact balanced. And then another response calling me a child when literally alls you've done is straight up insult someone you know nothing about on the internet, you know, like any mature adult would. I'm just clearly intellectually out matched by you.
---
Its not an easy class to level. Its made for pvp 1v1. You need to stop and eat a lot, you cant pull more then 3 mobs without evasion. When you reach blade flurry it will get easier but not that much.
---
Looks great! 
---
One typo I noticed: "The Forion Ridge" should be "The Forlorn Ridge" in Azshara

Byyyyyyye cunt. It was nice watching you make a full of yourself.

Spell Hit is totally different.  The miss rate of spells against +3 Level enemies is 17%.  However, only +16% Spell Hit will work because there's always a 1% miss rate to spells that can't be eliminated.  At least, that's been the working knowledge since Classic's original days way back in 2005/2006.
---
https://itemization.info/
---
[Accordjng to beta data](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5) +3 lvl, + 5 weapon skill still has 13% parry rate. Why would it drop 8% with 5 weapon skill?
---
It was always argued as either 8%, 8.6% or 9%. We never confirmed the exact number until now
---
there is a guy posted this map exactly but corrected all the typos...
---
now oyu take his map and do this process all over again :D
---
&gt; They don't know. Basically both the player base and Blizzard devs are unsure whether they're going to go down the TBC/WotLK Classic server route, or make new content for Classic WoW and with all the design philosophies of vanilla WoW.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If its the latter, then you probably will see class balance changes at some point.
---
&gt; However, that won't be for at least 2.5 years from now. I wouldn't worry to hard about class balance. You'll either get TBC which has better class balance, or you'll get post Naxx content which would eventually introduce class balance challenges.
---
Actually this is blizzards side of the argument
---
down under rated post
---
I'm EU. I didn't get in to the 1st tress test but when they closed down to put in wsg I got beta access. Without a sub. Word was it was just a bug. Servers came online and I created my character. Didn't need to re-activate. free-to-play beta bug? :)
---
10-35 you can literally auto-attack level
---
walk to target start auto-hit and watch/read something for a min. until you repeat, at least it gives time to work on something on the side but otherwise rogue is a class you pick if you wish to put in some extra time, the only class more time demanding than rogue would be warrior.
---
As a rogue you will also be in loot group of hunter, druid &amp; warrior thus it will require more raids to get lucky with what u need
---
ElvUI
---
Good point about the empty offhand, I don't think it'll be strong, but I will play around with it just to see. Are dungeon bosses also 63 or would I be safe with 5% hit? There is a talent for 3% hit in survival, making that easier to reach.
---
If it works out, I'll tell everybody how I did it. After that, who knows. If I reach my limit and can't possibly tank any further, then maybe I'll retire to Alterac Valley. But I'll struggle against being put into a box as long as I can.
---
Those aren‚Äôt good hunters. 
---
You‚Äôll miss out every so often but overall not a bad move.
---
When I leveled a hunter retail vanilla or pserver I was rarely if ever out damaged in a leveling dungeon.
---
‚ÄúIntellectually our matched‚Äù HAHAHAHA i can‚Äôt imagine the adrenaline that went through your coward ass when you typed that out, if you‚Äôd done even any research on classic wow and blizzards stance on this game, you would know they will not be thinking about changing the balance or state of the game beyond what they absolutely have too, as they have stated several times and was referenced above. You obviously have done the research and you created this post for attention on something you know is clean cut, and won‚Äôt be happening. THAT speaks volumes about your intelligence ‚Äúson‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

I really want an orc lock with all the talents to buff a pet, the set bonus from ZG and black book from BWL to see what a machine gunner imp is truely capable of.

Hahaha mages are increadible in vanilla. It's more when I play hunter things like paladins are just.... they may as well not even be there. Its less of an issue for them because of a mages high dmg output but against healers for example in premades 0 cooldown instant cast insane manadrain was simply just, ill thought out :)
---
Maybe I‚Äôm misinterpreting, but it seemed that there was no separate formula, based on the usage of the word modifier and the following sentence:
---
&gt; This means that the so-called ‚Äúhit cap‚Äù is in effect 9% rather than 8% for a player with 300 Weapon Skill fighting a level 63 monster with a Defense Skill of 315. 
---
This seems to imply that a character with 300 weapon skill would have a 8% chance to hit and THEN the modifier is applied and an extra 1% miss chance is added by negating the first 1% chance to hit.
---
Where are you getting phase 1 ending weeks after launch? It‚Äôs most likely going to be months and months away.
---
Paladin is without a doubt the easiest class to solo lvl, and it's not as boring as most people say :) Especially in areas with a lot of undeads. It's not the fastest, but it's absolutely not slow either and very fun.
---
Thanks son.
---
The bad hunters are bad and the good hunters are jerks so you really can't win.
---
Also agree but it does so...
---
Well people wanted classic Wow, that includes classic hunters.
---
&gt; We don't have any plans to make changes to any of the balancing in 1.12. We're starting with 1.12 because we feel like it's the most complete and balanced version of the game that was available at that period. That's where we're starting at, because we feel like it was very complete. I don't wanna say that we wouldn't listen to the community, obviously because the community's passion and feedback are really important and we really believe that every voice matters. We're always listening. But we do wanna make sure that we get this authentic recreation, because if you want the modern balance changes, we have those in Battle for Azeroth. If we wanted to get what we would do today, we have that. It's already available. But we don't have what we did back then, and we wanna give back people what we did back then, especially on things like class balance and that authentic gameplay experience and those authentic gameplay systems the way that they worked.

Blizzcon Interview, Brain Birmingham
---
Once you get blade flurry at 30, every now and then you can take afew mobs at a time with BF and Evasion up. And it gets even better at 40 with adrenalinet rush. Use CDs as often as they are avaliable. Dont wait around for special mobs or such.
---
Rogues are one of the slower levelers - just ahead of warriors since rogues have more escapes where a warrior would most likely die. 
---
But since we now know that pservers have buffed world mobs damage, you Will have a slightly easier time leveling on the official Classic. 
---
That being said, weapons are your number 1 concern as a rogue.  The weapon in your main hand should be the one with the highest damage (NOT DPS). So you are looking at the Numbers (example:) ‚Äù103-178‚Äù. Not the ‚Äù23.7‚Äù or w/e the Numbers may be. 
---
Be sure not to overkill! If a mob is low, and you have plenty of combo points to the point where eviscerate would be way over the top in damage - spend those points on Slice and Dice instead - since it Will help you on the next mob.
---
Slow weapon with highest damage range - since it works best with sinister strike. 
---
Always be sure to have instant poison up. 
---
And when fighting mobs that run, they Will always do a 180 turn and run away. So you can face them towards their camp - to Make them turn and run away from them rather than pulling more. 
---
Make sure you keep first aoe up to date. And dont underestimate food buffs of stamina and spirit etc. These Will help you keep sustained. 
---
And dont be afraid of using healing potions freely. If you are at 20-30% and not even in combat but bandage is on CD - chug a potion ans keep going. 
---
The number one factor to leveling speed is time between kills/travel time. So do everything you can to constantly be killing.  Thus always move towards the next kill while fighting, close enough to save time, but not aggro just yet.
---
Preferably never fight mobs that are higher Level than you.

Source is in comments.
---
The lore around Deathwing behind the game in books and such was huge, so for a WC-Nerd it was almost as big as Arthas and Illidan (but ofc not as relevant since they were the 2 key character sin Wc3)
---
 Now time for the "NO! NOOOOOO! NOTHING CHANGES! NOTHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!!!!!!!" 
---
Stop playing the victim please.
---
Going to Dun Morogh as a horde rogue and stealthing around lowbies with an explosive sheep out too see if they will attack it.
---
Do we have any proof that the formula is actually different if the defense gap is greater than 10? Changing the defense - weapon skill coefficient would increase/decrease the value of weapon skill so there should be an observable change in scaling should there?
---
Equally geared is easy peasy. 
---
Just get some blacksmith to craft you the Green Iron set twice (or thrice if you wanna do one more race, for control group purposes).
---
Then go gather the data. 1h of autoattacks only on +3 mobs for each character, while saving the combatlog.
---
Then parse the logs (or send them to me I'll gladly run the maths and do the statistical analysis) and come to a definite conclusion supported by actual facts, rather than just an hypothesis.
---
ROFL what the fuck are on?
---
If you‚Äôre a Rogue, your primary enemy is Rogue, in which case you go Orc. You go blacksmithing to deal with fear.
---
No one wants the modern balance changes of BFA and in 2.5-3 years. Thats going to be an utterly irrelevant statement. 
---
Shall I grab the quote from blizzcon where they said classic would never ever happen?
---
And this reply is excact reason why I will never grp with them.
---
They steal effective upgrade for most classes while their upgrade is minimal + replaced anyway. Rolling good wpn from paladin/warrior/rogues or casters items that incrase their dps.
---
I didn't make the map that's in the top post, I've made the edits I've mentioned in the comment you replied to :D
---
I liked the system when LFG was a list and you still manually formed groups and went to the dungeon the old fashioned way. It cleaned up trade and general chat being LFG spams
---
I have started in BC, not Vanilla, but man, I will level my boomkin and I will love it!
---
Just pen and paper. I‚Äôve tried many times to do digital but I just don‚Äôt enjoy it as much. I can never really get motivated to do it lol.
---
Rogue is pretty easy to play, as a rogue you are a single target DPS, don't pull packs of mobs they will overwhelm you, but when you get into trouble you have evasion, vanish and sprint to escape.  
---
Also do not forget your Stuns, always sap one of a pack, blind is also an option, and don't forget Thistle Tea.  
---
Rogues can be very powerful in PvP if you would like an idea on that the World of RogueCraft series is also a good starter.
---
You sound like the guy that ragequits after one wipe and everyone blacklists, so the jokes on you.
---
I feel you brother. I am also a "Efficiency over all else" person in some games, but I try to put myself back to the mindset that made me fall in love with Classic WoW when I first played it. 
---
From my point of view, getting to lvl 60 a week later is worth if I have helped some people on my way there, and made some friends too.
---
How many years ago classic was? Screw me, I cannot even remember, but what I can remember is all the friends I made from there, many of which I keep to this point.
---
Ah damn. Was thinking about getting something like this done once my friends and I reach 40 or 60 as a group thing and getting the psd or final high-res PNG to print off for each of us. Your line work and shading is dope üëç
---
Yes, wand spec creates little downtime but slow killing.
---
HOLY SHIT LMAO
---
Not really. Its just list among many. My main concern was them being ninjas but most cant also play their class.
---
If you want to roll a tank or melee dps and are going ally it behooves you to go human. The weapon skill isn‚Äôt just about the hit/block/dodge/parry it shines in glancing blow damage reduction. Check out the difference on glancing damage reduction.
---
Human = more dps/tps when wielding sword/mace. Orc is same for axe. Difference is there are far more swords and maces end game than axes.
---
ok? what you said is basically the same as what i‚Äôm saying. what do you mean it doesn‚Äôt work like that. he‚Äôs only been at this for a few years so it‚Äôs not crazy to say his net worth is probably a little higher than his pre tax annual income.
---
Gotta agree.
---
WC3 Frozen throne is best campaign. Especially the Bonus Orc campaign where you play as Rexxar where  WoW really got its roots from and was the begin thoughts on wow. This is what I have been doing waiting for classic. Hits the mark pretty good.
---
I just love when people like you come here and start crying about "balance and changes" and end up their wall of bullshit with "now come the downvotes". Is this supposed to deter people from pointing out the trash your write, or it's just some form of passive-aggressive plea for pity?
---
You want to change balance in Classic, one of the Pillars that made it what it was. Something even people that want OSRS approach won't touch.
---
I'm not arguing for them to straight up start the game off with changes already implemented in regards to what they think people wanted it to be. I'm asking weather they've stated they are going to be listening to the community and if enough feedback comes in after 2.5-3 years of being told "This game is overall better, but this tiny aspect right here, could be improved"
---
My understanding is that the entire point of classic was that they would extremely closely monitor community feedback. They did say they don't have plans to change anything. Having plans and being open to change are 2 different things.
---
How do you come with these numbers ?
---
You are extremely special. The only knowledge i've gained from you're probably autistic, or English isn't your first language.
---
Frost trap is legendary in 5-10m instances.   
---
I don't think the problem is who the class attracts, but that the class requires slightly higher aptitude to play proficiently. Multi-shot can easily break CC, your own CC isn't spammable, pet management can require extra attention, etc.
---
Deal with it man. You‚Äôre gonna hate being a rogue at max level when hunters and warriors are rolling on your leather. It‚Äôs gonna happen.
---
If you can‚Äôt handle having gear comp roll a tank or healer cause there is only one of those in 5 mans.
---
i think he means expanding on just no.
---
I completely misunderstood. I'll look at your map now.
---
Also important note that he says in the video is that the goal is to get everyone on a single layer... so potentially - going back to the original point - they would be servers with 20k+ players but a cap of 6,7,8k (unlike vanilla but that was due to technology back then)
---
I don't care if the new caps are higher than Vanilla - it's about the playerbase not having a drastic dropoff like they are anticipating and servers either being dead (which is unlikely because they don't want to have too many servers) so it's more likely that after layering is removed we have 6+ hour long queues at peak times.
---
... which is perfect because that's how the game was, sit in queue until you get in.
---
The worry is that fortnite kids will persuade blizzard to reopen layering or keep it in longer due to some servers having ridiculously long queues (only coming after they remove layering)
---
Hunters don't have taunt...
---
Dragon's Call! My Warrior's earliest tanking adventures involved it dropping and a Shaman took it. :(
---
But why does +2 weapon skill have a lower parry chance than +5 weapon skill?
---
Yes, cause Blizz needs to grab more cash.
---
I enjoyed leveling my paladin a lot. Not very interactive, but neither is a warrior. You have about the same amount of active abilities, over power and ms/bt, and seals/judgment. I loved leveling my rogue, it felt really smooth and quite fun. Much better than both my warrior and pally.
---
Interesting, I have very opposing experience, people being very friendly
---
Looks great! I especially like how you used the maps instead of the minimap textures. Looks cleaner imo.
---
mostly we could. the worst part to me was the pathetic calculated sociopathic networking style sucking up to big streamers like sodapoppin throughout the beta.
---
Pet?
---
Can‚Äôt watch the video now but I remember watching when he was interviewed and 99% sure he was speaking about the layering lasting a few weeks, not phase 1 itself.
---
Yeah, seems like I've confused multiple people with my wording, sorry about that :/
---
You literally asked if Blizzard was open to balance changes... they have come out and stated they are not. They do not view this as a seperate MMO to retail. It is meant to be a recreation of World of Warcraft prior to Burning Crusade with it flaws and all.
---
Watch some of [Skarm's videos.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5xSfo5nMGSmv00sGpRN7SQ)  He'll set you straight.

[This](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Miss?oldid=356356) analysis from a suspected blue poster, plus the fact it matches pservers and beta testing results and known sims.

Lol a furry downvoted you

People jealous of your 3 lives.

Jealous horde propaganda.

But why change it? People want vanilla WoW for a reason. We want vanilla WoW, not "kind of vanilla WoW".
---
If I want a chocolate ice cream and then you try to tell the ice cream man to give me cocoa instead of chocolate because it's better, I will get mad at you and still demand chocolate.
---
Man I hope not. The AH will be flooded with 3-5x the normal materials it would usually have and would not be good for a new server with a new economy.
---
It seems you managed to find the *other* map full of spelling mistakes... It boggles the mind how people spend probably dozens or hundreds of hours stitching together a complete map of Azeroth and then don't manage to spell Stonard, Misty Valley, The Tranquil Gardens Cemetery, Ahn'Qiraj, The Shimmering Flats, Camp Taurajo, (the list goes on) correctly.
---
Just to be clear, this isn't OP's fault, this map is available online and whoever originally made it sucks at spelling.
---
I toyed with the idea of printing one of these for my wall a couple of months back, but there literally is not a good-quality one anywhere to be found online. There's a good stitch of the minimaps at https://www.wyrimaps.net/wow#s:wow_comp_wotlk, but that uses a Google Maps style interface for it and doesn't offer an easy download. It probably wouldn't be too difficult to whip up a script to download it off the site, though, but you'd still have to do a bunch of image editing to clean up the ugly out-of-bounds areas, and parchment-style maps (ie. ones that use the world map maps) would look much better on a wall IMO.
---
If someone's very bored, good at Photoshop and digital art, has what is probably at least 50+ hours of work to spare, and wants to make a bunch of vanilla nerds happy, this is your cue. The world map images are available at https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1170&amp;p=6575.
---
I just saw that data, it's completely cleared it up. I was confused because blizzard just told us that +3 level mobs parried at 14%, they didn't say what causes it. We've never known exactly why, whether it's calculated based on the mob level or on the difference between your weapon skill and their defense. Since we've always known mobs parry at 5% at +0 and 6% at +2, My assumption(incorrect) was that increasing your weapon skill by 5 would cause a +3 mob's parry rate to drop to the equivalent of a +2, if that makes sense.
---
Really? That directly contradicts their statement on being interested in creating OSRS style content.
---
20 agility is 1 crit but.
---
Not crying kid. Asking if they are open to change, regardless of if theyve said they have no preconceived plans. 
---
"Is this supposed to deter people from pointing out the trash your write, or it's just some form of passive-aggressive plea for pity?"
---
It's actually just to point out the people with this attitude are immature clowns :)
---
/cluck
---
I had thoughts like this. Not that I'd advocate for them but I imagined what kinds of systems would I personally like to have in Vanilla that helped with QoL but wouldn't do a huge amount to hinder the Vanilla experience.
---
I would LFG to still be implemented somehow where you could show interest in dungeons and the system would automatically show you or others who is also interested. You'd still have to make the group with those people and go to the dungeon manually. It was just really inefficient to constantly spam for dungeons and keep looking to see if anyone else is. A lot of time people wouldn't even show interest unless a tank/healer is already found.
---
I didn't read the first comment at first haha. Was my mistake.
---
Because a lot of people want to play an underwhelming Ret. 
---
As for all others, they want your healings, not feelings :X
---
So no valance changes for vanilla. Go blizzard!
---
Whatever lets you sleep at night.
---
I have too, I am Horde so i don't play one, but I always thought they were good in raids and such. Shows how much I know lol Seems that way with druid and pally. Maybe the min/max disciples I dunno
---
Priests are still faster and easier despite that. Shaman get Ghost Wolf for very fast movement speed once they hit 20, great consistent damage output, and minimal downtime. Try again.
---
Doesn't have taunt either.
---
&gt; Looking for guild that will be emphasizing both PvE &amp; PvE elements
---
Hmm
---
And nowadays liberalism is supporting this behavior. What a time to be alive
---
probably an statistical anomaly. If you tested it over thousands of parries instead of hundreds you'd probably see more standard results.
---
Idk what OSRS is but yes they said they dont plan on running two MMOs but they could keep servers open even if only a few dozen people play.
---
I never notified any toxicity on private servers. But then I never played like a moron either.
---
I'm actually a day time sleeper tbh.
---
growl
---
This is appreciated. I've loved this map for a long time but always wished it was zone names only. Happy day.
---
bad plan, if people cant get to their servers they will try to screw over others who can buy things like gnome raiding their capital and crashing the server etc, best to take them all down at once.
---
to be fair your post started out as a well structured question and then devolved into a rant about hunters and pvp, so it does kind of feel like you are playing the victim here.
---
Realistically though people want the game to feel how it did in vanilla so its more that than the #nochange brigade that means there will probably be no balance changes, as someone said in another reply, its not out of the question just unlikely and if it does happen it wont be until people are clearing naxx on a regular basis will they look at changing anything
---
Damn homie you really don't like them huh?
---
I leveled all 3 during vanilla and it's actually true. Ghost wolf is faster movement but much slower killing. Priests are just slower in general.
---
* + 0.7% chance to hit
---
* + 0.28% chance to crit
---
* + 12.42% damage on glancing blows (40% of all white hits)
---
Oh, you meant if you're not an Orc or Human... but I was assuming you're not an idiot.
---
yeah I don‚Äôt disagree. just looking to find some real information that‚Äôs not just speculation.
---
I know what the point is, a pathetic one. Also you should be thankful to us kids, we are why you even get classic.
---
Couple days ago I was downvoted for saying that +5 weapon skill is effectively adding 4% hit...and everyone and their mother was "no, idiot, it's 0.2%", others "no, idiot, it's 0.4%".
---
I am amazed by most people's ignorance on basic shit. No wonder A LOT of people still think that 14% parry on Bosses in Classic is no big deal...and Druids will be "fine" as Main Tanks in raids.
---
That +5 weapon skill is effectively 1% hit, 1% less misses, 1% less dodged and parried hits, and removes the initial handicap of 1% hit, which is basically a 4% effective hit chance increase.
---
When running a long distance, equip sword, hit a mob, profit
---
Is not a taunt.
---
Nooooo they have stated they have no preconceived plans to change balance. Asking weather if they've stated that down the line they would be open to changes based on feedback is definitely a different question, and reasonable :)
---
That's all good and all but like I said I can go fish out quotes of them saying classic would never exist at blizzcon too. They've also stated they arent against the idea of introducing new 60 content if the demand is there. Thus obliterating the entire concept of it being a recreation. 
---
I was simply asking if they have ever stated if they are open to changes based on feedback down the line, not asking if they already intend to make changes on release or have stuff already planned. Of course they should release it how it was on day 1. But when it stomps retail into the ground and becomes the players and their main priority their attitude will change.
---
yep that sounds right. just curious about a real number.
---
Hunters are the most OP class.
---
The problem is the what formula Blizzard uses to calculate miss chance is not public knowledge. The dev from this most recent blue post discovered the code the modified the miss chance, suggesting it‚Äôs not a separate formula. 
---
In order to prove there‚Äôs a separate formula, someone would have to prove that the value of weapon skill changes when fighting an enemy with a defense gap of more than 10.
---
There‚Äôs no proof on that page that the information was supplied by a confirmed dev, and private server analysis has no relevance since they lacked the code Blizzard uses and are forced to emulate to come to the same hit cap values as live servers.
---
Widely available formulas, which I've explained in other comments below.
---
Rend nets more damage per rage than Heroic Strike. It's good all the way to level 30. Thunderclap is your only aoe early on, and it can act as a very low damage ranged execute. 
---
But hey, whatever you say man.
---
Yeah, but the glancing blow damage reduction only works out at something like 5 or 7% increase in total white damage, that's not a big enough difference to influence my race choice really.
---
I haven't seen hate for paladins. Just pallys sad they have to heal
---
If retail is so easy, were's your mythic 10/10 ?
---
You are forcing rose tinted glasses that don't belong to you, given to you by those private servers because you keep forgetting how easy it was, it was just time consuming. The only difficulty came from everyone being so shit at the game.
---
LFR is just as hard as molten core or BWL, naxx and AQ require more i'll give you that but anyone who has done normal on retail which is to say almost everyone will be able to do it. The only hurdle is time.
---
Nothing post launch, anything they are going to change will be in at launch.
---
Whatever you guys might think of Tips and his past. The dude has made the best vanilla videos and info videos on youtube and is more real than asmonbald and those other plebs. I STAND BY YOUR SIDE BRO!
---
He‚Äôs an Albino smurf, sunburn makes him nocturnal haha
---
It made you harpy
---
To everyone's who's reading this and is confused; see [this table](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill) for the currently theorized miss chance/hit cap at various weapon skill vs. defense skill levels. This is based on Blizzard's statements and on data we've collected from the beta so far.
---
Then why alot of times pet tanks and dies?
---
I dont play healer but I healed pets so many times.
---
I'll make sure to snipe all that sweet agi gear from unsuspecting hunters and rogues
---
/s
---
my god how many people that didn't play until post cata/pandaria are going to try classic and whine that its broken and doesn't work the way they want it to, agree that i hope the devs can withstand the complaining that those people will throw at them
---
Iv always played hpala they wants that sweet kings and blessing of freedom. IMO hpala breaks pvp In classic as long as you have a warrior with a big 2h wep
---
Yeah it does. The math I always recalled was weapon skill was inverse of defense. Defense is .04% per point. So weapon skill would be too. However the data says that for the first 5 points weapon skill is .08% per point, and .04% per point after.
---
You're literally proving the point that the no changes crowd is toxic and immature
---
That sentence has nothing to say about a player with a Defense/Weapon Skill difference of 10 or less.
---
The first bunch of levels suck, you just face tank and hope you don't aggro a 2nd mob. It's not until 15 or so when you start to get a few talent points in that it becomes a bit easier, and with the help of evasion. I'd duo level early if you can.
---
May take longer than most classes but it will be worth it in the long run!
---
Exactly.
---
How does this interact with dual wield? I only just read about not being able to reduce the 19% miss chance dual wield penalty until after patch 1.8
---
Damn I didn't notice that this map also had spelling mistakes that sucks :/
---
&gt; There's a good stitch of the minimaps at https://www.wyrimaps.net/wow#s:wow_comp_wotlk
---
I've actually tried to do it with that one first because it's closer to the original but it's just far too much work (with my experience level atleast) to make it look good. I found a download for it somewhere else actually.
---
Also I think I prefer the ingame map style stitched together, rather than a bird view perspective onto the entire map, it just looks cleaner imo.
---
I'll see if I can maybe still fix the spelling mistakes of the map I have right now.
---
Rogue and Paladin are worse, but definitely not Shaman or Priest.
---
&gt; I figured it was putting my mouth where my money is
---
Yeah, I'll be doing that when Classic actually is a product I get when I sub.
---
No it didnt. I just provided obvious examples. I could have gone through every single class and its problems? But that actually would have been a rant. And way too long for anyone to give a shit about. 
---
Thanks for the rest of your reply.
---
Normies? You mean normalfags.
---
That does pose a problem, in particular on streamer servers as they tend to be more popular. I imagine the servers will just be larger with queue times and they'll offer free realm transfers off the server.
---
I guess it depends on personal goals and the guild requirements. When I played vanilla on a not-exactly-official server I played a few caster specs and would use flask and damn near a dozen different elixirs. Shadow Priest in loatheb involved probably flask plus a dozen elixirs plus scrolls, and on every fight double-fisting mana pots and demonic runes to keep up mana.
---
Viper sting is 200+ mana on a 2800 mana class. Cleanse is 100 mana on a 5000 mana class. How is hunter going to drive paladin oom?
---
I think you have a personal vendetta. You want to discuss class balance, and your example of OP is... The hunter?
---
Try again, bro.
---
~20% more damage on 40% of your white attacks at +5. Add in all the other bonuses for when your tanking cause you are always facing the mob. Personally I think it‚Äôs a no brainer.
---
Old school Runescape. It did exactly what classic wow is doing, there Runescape 3 and old school Runescape, the players on oldschool Runescape vote for new content. It‚Äôs a really amazing system
---
There is nothing they will do... they want people to play at launch instead of sit in queues.
---
I don't understand why they can't flag you when you log in for the first time so you can't change layers for an hour. 
---
Want to play with a friend? Invite them in an hour (it saves integrity of economy)
---
PfUI is quality
---
One handed at that, he was using the other to stroke his butt-plug tail.
---
Someone who likes to sit at people it seems.
---
No. We are talking about the 1.0 vs 1.12 talents
---
Why should I deal with it when I can blacklist them. Its my choice.
---
I have very minimal problems with other classes compared to them.
---
The quotes are great hahaha
---
CoolStoryBob
---
But man I'd love if they flew in some super experienced people to help them retune it to be reminiscent of pre-1.12 difficulty.
---
No need to /s that, if you want BIS fury pre raid you will need roll that shit.
---
Best 10 seconds I‚Äôll spend today
---
Noooot even worth a response going in detail for the argument. I play hunter and warrior. Its all a hunter has to do to a paladin.
---
He talks about TANKS... why can't you read before commenting?
---
i often would gather people who suffered the same ganks and we would form a death squad and hunt down the gankers. Fun stuff. Other times ive been killed so much in an area i find a new zone or log off and play something else or play an alt. It sucks being the victim but its worth because youll be doing the same another time to another haha
---
Your awful grammar renders this post ironic.
---
See this right here. A mature, counter opinion. Thanks.
---
Where's the money come from in raids? Just gold drops from killing stuff? The classic or original vanilla gold/economy situation is definitely not something I'm in touch with.
---
It doesn‚Äôt need to, it‚Äôs stating that a player with 300 weapon skill has a 8% miss chance before the modifier. The calculations I‚Äôm making are based off that. A player with a defense/weapon skill gap of 10 or less would fall into the same category as the example before the modifier would be applied.
---
I speak 4 languages english is not my native.
---
I definitely think anyone that missed out on Wrath is hurting themselves if they are a WoW fan, but honestly, there is nothing that great about the ones after. I'm not saying that some of them didn't have some decent raids or dungeons, but oldschool WoW truly ended after Wrath and was fairly gone even by then, tbh.
---
Thank you for this, super insightful!
---
I dug up my old PC, and rooted through the hard drives to find my old screenshots from Vanilla, and I came across this one.  Was such an epic time, even on 5fps.  I sure do miss my rogue.
---
Can't wait for Classic in August!
---
Was it the Chad?
---
Clique, auctionator, auctioneer, skada, tellmewhen/weakaura. That's all.
---
And if person a bids 50 dkp, and person b bids 650, he still loses all that dkp? Sounds like a ridiculously off system, maybe I am missing the point.
---
Not knowing whether you should bid a lot or not sounds like a nightmare, not even knowing if it is contested at all...
---
What is the pros compared to a normal dkp system?
---
Nah you all told us it was harder than private servers.
---
I just figured they would know why, when I resub to grab classic character names.
---
But I can appreciate anyone's reasons why or when. We're all going to have fun in classic.
---
The reason you just gave was rolling on gear upgrades. As a rogue at end game you‚Äôll have 2-3 other classes rolling against you. Are you gonna blacklist them too?
---
No one hates paladins. Everyone dislikes ret paladins in pve raids.
---
Thanks a bunch for posting this. I was worried as a dwarf tank i was going to be doing even less damage compared to a human.
---
Can't speak for paladins, I was horde. I almost put rogues on the list but I found things like sap made rogues a feel easier. Pulls that were. 2v1 on my warrior became a 1v1 on my rogue
---
See? Our community already tested it. Question answered. Now we wait again for Classic to come out.
---
I almost wish they didn't tell us the release date. Time goes so slowly now. The closer I am, the longer it takes for me.
---
Titan Panel over Questie? dafuq?
---
You can farm the Quint on just one person, and then summon them back and forth.
---
I don't think anyone hates Paladins. I've never seen someone say that. 
---
People hate leveling them cause they're boring, but other than that they're great to have around. I love the class fantasy and their utility, but I've never been able to get one passed 20.
---
the other issue with private servers is your not paying for it so what do you care, if you have spent as much as some of us older players on an account you don't want it banned because you as a dick to someone
---
That might work for runescape but that is what ruined wow so I can't see them going back to make the same mistake.
---
Mr. Moneybags
---
I really don't know how to explain it any clearer. The miss chance of a player from 0 to 15 rating difference is NOT linear. You're acting like it is.
---
you will find it more on private servers as its free to play on them, you see it on a lot of f2p games
---
Dont see many prot palas.
---
Warrior tank vs rogue usually.
---
Now you have Hunter vs REST.
---
You could farm legion gold some and get a token out of it without much effort, within that 3 month time. Although I could understand if people would rather use their time for something else. I'm going to try and lose 10 pounds before it starts.
---
Play with noobs and guide them through the game.
---
hey its me ur brother
---
Monkey island set in Azeroth would be dope
---
And I thought that said playa hater at first lol I was like playa hater wtf?
---
Yes, that is what I meant. It's still a button being used. I'm currently doing that on private server. My point is this wont be needed in classic due to how the macro API works now.
---
pfUI is not getting updated for classic
---
Have you noticed how toxic this subreddit has become lately? And it's not because of ps players. This was a really friendly community at the beginning when it was comprised mainly of ps players. It's because of the recent influx of retail refugees.
---
For context the bfa physical collectors edition launched at $100
---
Big opportunity missed not going with the vanilla analogy. 
---
Well that's just it, because the demand for classic itself is so huge theirs varying opinions on what they want the game to be. I personally think it should be released exactly as is and go through all phases of content release with no changes. However they've stated they arent opposed to new 60 content after naxx. And if their's new content after naxx for PVErs which would turn the game into "kind of vanilla". Then their should be content changes for the pvp crowd too ie some minor adjustments to the existing mechanics. Im not saying for example "WARRIORS NEED HEROIC LEAP IN VANILLA!" but slight adjustments to whats their based on their feedback would definitely be a smarter and fairer approach once the game hits that point (Thats if they dont go with tbc servers afterwards, in which case pvp will be in a great state anyway)
---
You must've been playing on a super computer back then... AQ opening at this resolution and fps? Nice.
---
*playing with his foot* 
---
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not really any harder like that that...‚Äù
---
Are you kidding? Druids are the best 5/10 man tanks because of their higher threat generation and better aoe threat. They also move the group through the instance way faster by topping themselves off between fights and innervating the healer.
---
Your changing your main based on a lvl 30 dueling contest... 
---
Fill your boots mate, as long as your know how to decurse and press frost bolt you will be fine
---
I am willing to suck some dick for an invite. Bliz employees pm me.
---
Who would ever roll Human to do slightly more dps in care bear PvE content? Imagine playing 2019 Vanilla and having PvE as your main priority, LMFAO, couldn't be me. But, I'm clearly talking to a 2006 Vanilla player.
---
Oh, from Vanilla's best Warrior: https://gyazo.com/b1165b697bb73768fec1c4ea765ee2d0
---
My native language isn‚Äôt English indeed.
---
I‚Äôll be open to switch to German Spanish or French whatever you prefer.
---
Thunderfury on second tank/terrible dps?
---
But it seems like +3 mobs have an bonus chance to parry vs you (around 8%) that was never in place on private servers and that cannot be reduced (beyond more than a fraction) by having extra weapon skill. This is where my confusion arose.
---
Bring back omen!
---
Not quite
---
In Classic, only Holy is a viable spec and that fact is hard to accept.
---
Pally Power for paladins
---
**[A] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience ‚Äì and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can‚Äôt attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week ‚Äì but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I‚Äôm looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn‚Äôt see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
We have a few names in mind, which we are discussing on Discord.
---
I am hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay the 10s for the guild charter.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
While serving my term in the FDF (Finnish Defence Forces), I once saw some of you guys on a training exercise at a gathering at Allentsteig in Austria, together with the Austrian special forces, the "Jagdkommando".
---
That was a right bunch of badasses right there :D
---
No, you're talking to a 2019 speedrunner, which is the only kind of hardcore PVE player left.
---
I mean its one of the first ever internet based shows around gaming. It would be crazy to compare it to today's standards. This was before youtube really was a thing.
---
Not worth it really. The shaman armor is very bad because it's trying to do everything at the same time. There is no shield with spell damage and the main hand is ok, but you really don't need to grind R14 for a weapon. Go get the mace from ZG.
---
Honestly shaman is one of the classes I would rate at the bottom of the R13 set usefulness. Even priest gets a pretty decent shadow DPS set. Shaman gets.... 13 str 1 crit 9 spell damage 8 spirit.... Really?
---
Postal. That's all you really need
---
Asmongold was considering pve maybe. He was also considering trying to hide his server. Good luck on hiding, because he won't be able to. But I want to know before I go creating characters somewhere.
---
I wouldn't know. I stopped half way through wotlk after starting in 2005.
---
Who pissed in your fucking cereal? I'm asking for advice, I never said I'm entitled to anything. Now fuck off.
---
Sounds like you need your safe space before the game has launched
---
Blasphemy!
---
beta warrior becomes beta warlock
---
Bold assumption that subs have been tripled.
---
why does everyone in this sub hate this guy?  Sry I am new for twitch shit.
---
What? Your own formula would make it linear. You‚Äôre increasing the miss chance by a percentage per point of defense/weapon skill gap. By your own formula if you were to increase the weapon skill by 1 it would increase the miss chance by 0.2% chance each time.
---
I almost started working on it myself, but I'm just not good enough at digital art to carry it out. I decided the best way to get a clean full parchment-style map of Azeroth would be to just redraw it all yourself. You would already have to do lots of redrawing if you stitched together the original maps because they're all at a different scale (eg. roads in The Barrens are twice as wide as those in Mulgore) and don't perfectly match up to the full-scale Kalimdor/EK maps, so might as well just draw the whole thing as one cohesive unit.
---
Someone's even made a pretty good set of assets that imitate the Blizzard map style at https://www.patreon.com/posts/world-of-style-14313082 that could come in handy for it... but I'm no artist.
---
"Classic summer"
---
I just don't want to be questing in an area when they roll in trying to do the same, because it will be a mess. I'll just immediately go elsewhere, but I'd rather just avoid the hassle in the first place.
---
Teh sound makes it. It's from a Eric Andre skitt.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5nV9aKthU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ5nV9aKthU)
---
How very controlling of you, you're coming across as toxic.
---
That is some next level neckbearding
---
&gt;All this talk about World of Roguecraft and rogues being 1v1 gods! Where? I didnt see it. It's only going to get worse when mages have ice barrier and improved CS.
---
Pepelaugh... he doesn't know.
---
You can't tank. That's a fact, nothing hateful about it.
---
Now go and heal
---
Its absolutely still viable, its just more jank to get started
---
Like private servers = good players? So many elitists on this sub lolll
---
Shout outs to gms I‚Äôve never had a bad experience with one, they‚Äôre great
---
Source? None?
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs big but not huge. In the end aesthetics are most important. I don‚Äôt mind humans so I‚Äôm 100% ok with rolling one when I do roll melee.
---
There is a strong hate against any non-holy pally.
---
What is this post about?
---
The Blackrock is da real shit. But Tempel rocks, Dire Maul rocks, Strath rocks. In conclusion, they were all pretty decent with a nice twist and secrets. Bad ass dungeon desing by far
---
Someone made a good point though about streamers. If you are needing mats and they need the same, you may get harrassed from their legion of followers when all you are doing is trying to play the game.
---
It could suck if you are trying to quest near them at all. Or raid with them. Or just run dungeons with them.
---
I will prefer to keep my toons away from streamers. Maybe have one or two just to play around when stuff is going on in streams. Like watching the tourney live would have been cool
---
Hopefully nobody said that seriously. Too tough to prove at this point. 
---
At this point I'm mostly speaking about design goals rather than what is or isn't currently in the beta. That should be the focus: can we, as a player base, encourage Blizzard to take steps to ensure that things resemble the difficulty that they offered throughout most of Vanilla?
---
Not really, you can always run away/go to another city. Would that be annoying? Yeah but not a bannable offense. You still have agency. Now if they were specifically targetting you over and over with that boss, that'd be another question.
---
Couldn't crop that? Now I'm blind and won't be able to read the quests either, thanks.
---
Now that you mention it I think every class needs a kick, heal, more cc, a free trinket ability, good aoe and let's say a pet. And I really think we need panda race
---
That's what your quote said. They might make changes post classic but during classic they won't.
---
The layers are all part of the same server. Yrah the AH's are together. What difference does it make? The difference is that the servers will have a lot more people than vanilla had. That will result in more items sure but the demand increases too.
---
Yeah there was a post saying that if you have a CE account you will be able to get the pets.
---
( What many people don't know is you only get to pick one per character ) So my little zergling will continue my adventures with me.
---
waste of time, mob xp caps out at +5 levels above your character level, and the percentage a lower level character gets iin a grp  its stuff all.   
---
...if i understand what you;re saying correctly.
---
Idk it is non sense to me.
---
&gt;Was wondering why?
---
Well, let's put it this way:  
---
You guys provide the most powerful buffs in the game, you are the most mana efficient healers (once you got a bit of crit under your belts), you can prevent wipes, and you are the single most annoying thing to meet as a defender in Arathi Basin, and you're the reason why Alliance raids usually have no trouble filling the primary healer ranks.
---
A lot of people play horde.  
---
And jealousy is a thing ;-)
---
Alliance EK leveling 1-30 is the best in the game, whether elywn or dun morogh. 
---
At max, it get more subjective, I just like looking at horde races more. 
---
It‚Äôs argued alliance have an edge in pve and horde for PvP. 
---
I have an unfounded hunch the aggregate balance will lean slightly in favor of horde.
---
All the best endgame weapons are swords. Gressil and Hungering Cold are above everything else.
---
Salute right back at ya.  I got to see some some of the Seals, when I deployed to Iraq, so I bet what you saw was pretty awesome as well. 
---
If I am not mistaken I think the DKP guy served as well. It might have been in the FDF too.
---
I have no fucking idea man... gave up half way in.
---
I think everything that is in 1.12 will drop. Except if the place where it drops just isnt in the game yet like dire maul.
---
I saw the episode yesterday!!
---
Doesn‚Äôt work in 1.12 I think, but I got upset with the amount of Chinese gold farmers on our server so I bought a shit ton of white daggers and some green wrapping paper and sent out lots and lots of C.O.D.‚Äôs of special packages.  Didn‚Äôt hurt that my character‚Äôs name was ‚ÄúJulie‚Äù and Julie‚Äôs Dagger was a nice offhand dagger for level 50.  Here you go, random Chinese name player.  Nice Julie‚Äôs Dagger for 5g.  Cha Ching.
---
As the story goes... this prank resulted in an interesting exchange that led to me meeting my wife.  I had sent one of these special packages to a friend of hers - (his name looked enough like a China farmers to me!) and ended up on her ignore list after he told his crew about this asshole Julie sending out fake packages.  We happened to run into each other in a pug scarlet monastery and I have to be eternally thankful to the other group members who convinced her to take me off ignore to run the instance.  14 years later and we‚Äôre making our plans for Classic. &lt;3
---
You buy it, you keep it.
---
It is not effective at all.. Sorry to shatter your dreams. Here are your two major obstacles:
---
1. Most vanilla dungeons have a 10 man limit. There are some with 5 or 15, but none of them have 40.
---
2. Just watch streamers right now trying to do lvl. 40 dungeons with lvl. 30 characters. It is extremely inefficient because your chance to hit against very high level targets is abysmal.
---
This really needs to be brought to attention, some game breaking stuff in there
---
Every 2019 speed runner knows Edgemaster's is BiS until Gauntlets of Annihilation, unless you have one of the god maces (2019 speed runner should know what I'm talking about, right?) or using double swords and one is Maladath. But, since you're obviously not a speed runner, you've won the 2019 brainlet award, congratulations.
---
I agree, Esfand's last highlights video his alt channel uploaded was crap, almost no WoW content, only some silly attention whores. I say raise the cap to 40, will be interesting to see the streamers grind for lvl 40 BiS and mounts. But then leave it at that until release.
---
Having the old code doesn't necessarily mean they are running it. They could've just reconstructed it, which means if there are parts there that they didn't notice, it wouldn't be in Classic. So it is still reassuring that evidently they did do some form of porting of old code instead of rewrites.
---
See the edit in the original post? You're exactly who I was laughing at.
---
Yeah man, he's top tier. He's definitely the exception to the rule.
---
Esfand is another good dude to watch. Damn good pally. Soda has grown up a lot. Can still be a prick sometimes, but not as bad as he was a few years ago.
---
No, what ruined wow was stupid decision by devs. Fun content can still be made if it maintains the core values of what we all love about vanilla wow.
---
You changing faction/ class up at all?
---
Speaking of buying the game though, if anyone is thinking about buying wow to do classic:
---
You don't need to buy BFA. You only need an active sub. You could do a trial account, then activate it by paying the monthly sub. Then you're good. 
---
Side note: That account should also be good up through Legion content, if you care to try that side out or farm gold for tokens. I'll be in classic though üòÇ
---
It burns us
---
Your skillz in decrypting gibberish are impressive.
---
I was saying not quiet because your own comment simplified the situation.
---
For good reasons.
---
You underestimate just how good Venruki and the other top players are. The top 3 players are all Blizzcon champions and R1 PvPers. Hell, Cdew finished 3rd as Enh Shammy and was 2-0 on Venruki despite being probably the worst 1v1 class.
---
I played ele shaman in blues. It's absolutely fine, don't listen to pessimists that haven't actually played it, that's just imo.
---
Shamans power doesn't come from just doing dmg. Even then, full combo, if everything crits is ~3k dmg with little to no spell dmg. People in full epics will likely rek you, but thats the case with any spec if relatively undergeared
---
The problem was the devs followed player requests. Mob rule is a terrible way to design a game and classic is a great example. Classic sucked to do almost anything in and that's why its beloved. Devs made that game and then devs giving in to community pressure ruined it.
---
i mean, if all you wanna do is just solo, then yeah, go for something like Mage or Hunter, but if you wanna heal/tank... just go for it. you'll level slower, but, you can do solo content just fine.
---
Monkeynews was attacking people I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
See this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
There is some about adding back the old code.
---
(And just copy pasting back old code can lead to missing or incorrect stuff just as easily as reconstructing the formulas in new code. What matters is paying attention. I know, I'm a game developer myself.)
---
I have a confession to make. I have not been subbed for years but spurred by my classic excitement I decided to sub and try BfA. I did not like it at all and asked for a refund after playing it for a few hours. They refunded both my BfA purchase and my subscription, so all in all I was subbed for maybe 48 hours. Then i got into the classic beta. Please don't kill me.
---
I‚Äôm playing on a private server and I don‚Äôt use any of these except a meter. Vital addons I find are buff/de buff timer and enemy castbar. I honestly hope they add those to the new client classic wow at least as options because if not everyone is using an add on for them anyway.
---
I'm fairly sure that's pretty much the recommended balance druid PVP specc. There's a few druid PVP guides available that touch on that specc IIRC. One is by a guy called Gohan if I'm not mistaken. Don't have the links here as I'm on my phone. 
---
I think the combo could be pretty sick - you're two classes that call burst and heal, and have some survivability. Should be nasty. 
---
You could also go for a more support / survival focused build, either the FC specc or HotW, and let him do the majority of the DMG, while you kite and heal. Up to your preference I guess.
---
One of the biggest misconceptions people have about Hunters is that their pet is almost worthless while raiding. But you can use your pet on 90% of
---
raid encounters.. The most important aspect in addition to knowing how to control your pet so that they don't aggro mobs or do anything else stupid,
---
is to respec your pet though Beast Training so they have the right resistances for that raid, and then they wont die easy...
---
This was funnier then I want to admit
---
That's the only way to break to paragraphs down into one sentence. Shit that's what a summary is, simplified.
---
Tbh rogues are 1vs1 gods but more out in the open world where they can get the jump on someone. A 1vs1 tournament isn't where they shine.
---
Haven't played in a long time, but I last played a Blood Elf paladin.  For Classic, I think I'll do my Troll Rogue again.  I really miss those times.
---
I loved them, but going back to a system where you couldn't just aoe your way through the instance didn't really work well with most players. Cata really was the point were I realised, that wow (+ playerbase) was on a path that would not work for me.
---
Holy shit this has just given me a flashback to one of my finest noob moments!
---
I never used to know what the broken armour icon was and couldn't for the life of me figure out why sometimes it was there and sometimes it wasn't (thankfully one of the addons I downloaded automatically repaired you I believe)
---
I'm looking forward to people being surprised they can no longer throw their frost trap :D
---
To be fair though, in most dungeons, you don't need CC. It has it's uses against some of the more hairy packs in Strath and Scholo, but Vanilla Dungeons are pretty easy if the group knows what it's doing.
---
God I am gonna get a lot of downvotes for this :D
---
Skyrim paddle weapons made it into Classic!
---
agreed
---
Its not just me,  any vanilla warrior guide explains why you shouldnt buy more than rank 1 Rend and to never use Thunderclap
---
Well simplified to a point where it completely misrepresented the situation** is what I should have said. Shit man. Thanks for explaining that to me.
---
Nah, that may be the case with other shops, but what kind of fucking idiot tries to sell fruits to Orcs? It was probably made worse by the goddamn MEAT SIGN and CUT UP MEAT everywhere in the shop, so Orcs come in, "Got meat?" Her response is then, "No, me fruit vendor. Want fruit?" They then punch her in the face (this explains why female Orcs are ugly, they get hit all the time) and leave angry.
---
I was a glutton for punishment, but yeah I had just built a beefy new PC in 2005, so I was ready.
---
It seems like streamers are getting bored and the content they're putting out is getting weaker and weaker. Okay, the duel tournament was fine, but after that, there's really not much. 
---
Should Blizzard raise the level cap to lvl 40? I think it would be interesting to see streamers grind for mount money and lvl 40 BiS gear. Also, this would give the opportunity to test for more bugs in lvl 40 zones, dungeons and maybe even mount bugs. However, in my opinion, I think they should leave it capped at 40 until release and never re-raise the cap again to 50 or 60. It would have the potential to kill the hype. So I'd suggest to raise it to 40 and leave it there and see what happens.
---
What do you say? Leave it at 30 until release or raise it to 40 and leave it there until release?
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans
---
(You can also play it, if you are not averse to look for it in not-exactly-legal places... :)
---
Yeah, minmaxers' crusade to impose what is optimal.
---
Is the tradition different from where you from? Where I come from I thank people that take the time out of their day to put on a great showing for people. There were like 200,000 people watching his tournament, it was great for the game and a massive success. Just going to assume you are trolling or being sarcastic.
---
...What?
---
I had to grind so hard to get my epic mount and have money for repairs.  I was in a raiding guild back then, so lots of trips to Tyr's Hand.
---
I doubt they will, there's a rather large pushback against it. Though personally the only change I'd like to see is a cooldown on Voidwalker sac. Makes locks far too broken.

Shamans are significantly faster than Warriors. If you are killing slower on a Shaman than on a Warrior, you are doing it wrong. Priests are absolutely not slower than Warriors. Priests are fucking *machines*, man. Assuming you play correctly you will never have to stop to drink.
---
My favorite was me and a fellow rogue around level 50ish would get our friend around level 25 to sit in the middle of stv road and dance. If the alliance left him alone or danced they got to pass...but most would try to gank him so we would gank them in a few seconds hehe.
---
There's 2 problems with your logic.
---
1. Your opponents are not as good as the best PvP-ers in the game.
---
2. You are not as good as the best PvP-ers in the game.
---
That‚Äôs not the issue at all lol
---
If you get aggro, it means you‚Äôre going to lose F I F T Y D K P because you didn‚Äôt know what the fuck to do!
---
If you get hit into the whelps, you lose F I F T Y D K P again!  For not being where you‚Äôre supposed to.
---
&gt;Also in general so many of them are toxic
---
And making blanket terms about an entire class because you met a few arseholes isn't?
---
How many hunters DID you meet? Even if you are nolifing like crazy, I bet it was about a dozen, two dozen tops.
---
Now, how many people will play classic? Let's put a low bar, and say one million. Hunters are a well played class, easily 20%. So there will, at the low end, be 200,000 Hunters. You met 0.012% of all hunters by now. Let's say you played nonstop and only with hunters, meeting 400 Hunters so far. That would still be only 0.2% of all players who play the class.
---
You see where I am going with this?
---
I have problems understanding what you try to say or ask here.
---
You, as an individual simply have to be kind. Answer those repeated questions in General chat. Help the newbies out. Point out gently when people are making obvious mistakes and such. Report spammers and people posting offensive stuff in chat. Encourage those who are doing their best. The more people who are kind, the better.
---
It's always my pleasure to brighten your day. But no. If Blizzards starts fooling around then the game is done. You remember that meme where everyone said wow and blizzard is dying? That's reality now and they must be very careful with what they do from now on. Overwatch is failing and wow is failing, diablo and hots already failed and there's no new IPs.
---
Stay true man
---
&gt;If you‚Äôre telling people to hold on to items to make more gold later on, it‚Äôs not the best advice. Always invest in your character first.
---
But isn't that what they're doing? They're just saying don't sell it for 70g now if what you want to buy is going to take another two weeks anyway, especially if that item will be worth 140g by then. The general idea is that everyone will be saving up for their epic mount; spending gold on most items will be wasteful early on.
---
Looks like someone hasn't played Vanilla since 2006.
---
40 simply for talent testing.
---
The same is true for most Priests, Warriors, Warlocks, Mages, Rogues, Shamans, Paladins and Druids. What's your point?
---
I'm not, but do it for these kind folks.
---
They have told streamers a week or two ago they'll be increasing to 40.
---
It's June... they'll go to 40 soon and 50 at the end of July.
---
There is a fine line between optimal and viable
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwhnzt/10_man_dungeons_were_a_thing_in_vanilla_here_is_a/
---
Thanks for the help, I got the 40-man dungeons idea from the top comment here, so I‚Äôm wondering if it is possible for them to work in classic, if it was a vanilla thing only or if it was never possible.
---
Sees lvl 30 tournament with super limited player pool.
---
Decides to abandon class.
---
What are you on, dude? If the tournament was at lvl 29, mages would not have ice block and this thread would be about something completely different. Anything you see before 60 is not the real game.
---
Also, in duels a hunter is limited by the flag distance. Gimme mages in the open world and I'll show you what my 41 yards can do. But if you are changing your class because of a lvl 30 duel tournament in a beta... What were your plans when classic hits? Do nothing else but duels all day?
---
World of Roguecraft is based on how insanely oppressive Rogues are out in the open world. They can choose their targets and they literally sneak up on people and ambush them. Rogues have never been more than a medium dueler and even worse in battlegrounds. Mages are kings of organized PvP.
---
There is also, as you can see, a lot of skill involved in the tournament. Deadzoneing hunters, killing warlock pets, ragestarving warriors, forceing rogues out of stealth with good predictions and useing every possible little engineering gadget and trinket to get ahead is more of a highly competitive scenario. Sneaking up on someone leveling at half health in STVietnam is very different.
---
Yes. I am big into battle pets and people do still bug them for thousands. I wish I‚Äôd bought one back in the day.
---
This. Is. Great!
---
Kr*nos may have 30min paladinbuffs but retail vanilla only had 15min (even the greater ones). That will be a pain in the arse.
---
Also, Alliance will be able to get rendbuff if tryhard enough.
---
ye we know the skit
---
I sort of feel like this whole thread is just me educating you. Your welcome.
---
If you honestly think by implementing a cooldown on a single ability on 1 or 2 classes or putting the hunter trap on 1 or 2 other classes pvp trinkets will end the game. Then you have no idea what your talking about.
---
Yeah, but let's say there is a hunter, and hes in a raid guild, and you leave the group telling everyone: "I don't play with Hunters".
---
Congratulations, YOUR ass just got blacklisted by 70+ people. More if they have a partnership with other guilds, which is pretty common.
---
So you won't have to worry about playing with hunters, because pretty soon, your reputation on the realm will be so bad, no one will want to play with you anyway.
---
I think you misunderstood me. What I'm trying to say is (the way I understand it anyway) that there will be no influx of items as the world, the AH and resources will exist as a singularly. In other words lets say item called "the stick of truth" was put on the AH by a player on layer1 it will show up on all layers. If someone buys it, regardless of which layer they are in, it will disappear in ALL layers-not just the layer the buyer belongs to.
---
Same with resources as well. The server will spawn a black lotus-it will appear to players on all layers but if someone in layer 1 picks it then it disappears from all other layers as well.
---
Then again I could be completely wrong and each layer may have its own spawns for items/resources.
---
Its a confusing concept and hopefully we wont have to deal with it as layering will be removed all together sooner rather than later.
---
I suppose some top guilds will do it for maximum patchwerk dps parses.
---
It's been a long time since I've played classic wow. Probably since right around the time TBC hit. But it's pretty well known that top tier raiders can do things most people can't do, and it's incredibly disingenuous to say it's a "close second" behind prot warriors for bears. Just because .001% of the playerbase can manage it doesn't mean they're close to being equal. Bears make great OT's but the first Rag kill will be with warrior tanks. And so will the second. And the third. And it's because prot warriors make much better tanks than bears in Vanilla. Bears are second, but it's not close.
---
I don't care what you do in RETAIL, this is all about CLASSIC!
---
That is a broken value - from my understanding has something to do with EXP conversion values..
---
2.5g quest rewards barely happened in TBC.
---
Honestly the trailer perfectly captures the feeling of World of Warcraft. It also such a great roleplaying feeling: The adventures and heroes return home from the greatest battlefields on Azeroth. The music, the editing, everything is great.
---
They're gonna increase it at some point. What's the point in having a beta where more than half the game goes untested..? Yes, yes, we all know it's doubling as a marketing tool, but there's still a ton of legit bugs being found and reported. All the 30-60 and at least some end game content needs testing before release.
---
Beta is here to test things, not to give streamers content. I believe, they will raise it when they are ready
---
Shaman both do less damage than warriors and have more downtime so I'm not sure how they net faster. And yes priests have little down time but they aren't speed levelers. Wand spec is legit a life saver but it isn't incredible dps.
---
There is no hate, Ret just doesn't do any Pve Dmg (1/3 in comparison to other classes) and can't tank because of no taunt. These are facts! They are amazing healers though.
---
Also seems Esfand is around, who spent his life makin ret somewhat OK everbody thinks they can do it too. Esfand uses every consumable in the game, not a single ret pally will do this in classic because of the cost and work you have to put into it.
---
As I said, you do not understand the simple concept of "create a replica of vanilla". Its fine, people are not created equal.
---
But in light of the above, I hope you dont mind if I dont start dwelling deeper into balancing issues between pve and pvp, homogenization etc (harder concepts to understand).
---
Have a nice day and think before you post again for our own good.
---
&gt;Is mage going to be vastly different than i am used to? Is the shaman totem quests worth it (when i did them in WotLk i had a mount and strategically placed hearthstone and still made me a little bored), and is the rogue poison profession too difficult for what im used to.
---
&gt;I am leaning to mage so i can make a little money on the side with portals and food.
---
- frostbolt forever 
---
- totem quests worth it?
---
- rogue poison isn't a profession, you do make them but it isn't a profession 
---
- every mage will try to make money with portals and food.
---
Go rogue
---
30 level duels changing your opinion isn't a good idea. Also warlocks will annihilate you later if you go mage, for example.
---
Don't take that tournament as any indicator of what you should play.
---
We need to get that salt of your face!
---
Since Classic is patch 1.12, won't there be a flight path at Thorium Point?
---
The point is to preserve the game as it was back then, so that we can play it years from now like we can play any other classic game that isn't an evolving game like WoW. So if they start changing things, where will it be in 10 years from now? Obviously not as different as current WoW but it will sure won't be the true classic experience anymore 
---
Would be cool to see separate servers though, where they can make changes and even add content :)
---
Because in retail it is a Taunt.
---
In Classic, it's a threat building ability.
---
Maybe you should learn about the functionality of basic abilities, before you criticise others for their class....
---
The only way it changes from increasing 0.1% to 0.4% is by changing the percentage in the formula, which would be... a different formula, which you stated should be wrong with the new information. 
---
Honestly if you want to skew your information so you can make snarky comments that‚Äôs your own prerogative, but I‚Äôm not about to argue this anymore.
---
I was there (was a wisp back then) and this is pretty much what happened.
---
I was already going mage, but now I'm starting to get a bit worried that there will be too many mages, and gear will be a pain to get. Can we do another one of these tourneys and have a rogue win please.
---
Yeah, I'm confused, too. I mean, I get what a Chad is but what's the correlation between Chads and not having access to credit card to do things the easy way? Last I checked Chads aren't making monthly runs to Gamestop so their WoW account doesn't expire, they're banging Stacy's while the rest of us run to Gamestop so our WoW account doesn't expire.
---
misses don't give weapon skill
---
Or perhaps blizzard dun goof'd and is now covering up their incompetence by claiming the existence of a *"magik spechuil 1% extra hidden hit modifyer"*
---
I dunno what to believe.
---
I speak 3 languages accent free, and one more with a heavy accent. Knowing multiple languages is no excuse for bad grammar.
---
Missing a number of flight points
---
Send many wrapped packages with 5g cod to get a girlfriend, got it.
---
I wish the Diablo pet breathed fire more often. He very rarely does it.
---
Damn, that pro-gamer, multi-rank 1, world champion and well know for being a duel monster won a lvl 30 tourney with a mage. Better roll mage, that shit look op as fuck, nothing to do with the gamer'skill.
---
More seriously, roll a mage if you want but be ready to be rolled on by a lot of people. Mage are strong but still clothies and, I might be wrong, you don't have the skill of ven or ziqo. What they are doing look like ez but it's not always, they have 10 years of intense pvp experience behind  them
---
is the farming for the poisons going to distract me from leveling and gearing?
---
I hear you brother! :D
---
Once again, it's not as simple as you make it sound. I think we can agree that in both systems a lot of spreadsheets will be compared. 
---
A functioning loot council is a bliss and will always beat DKP, but it can also go south a lot faster and easier if the council lacks either integrity or transparency. Under DKP at least everyone has the same options to fuck it up.
---
Oh, you will. Be sure of it.
---
#HumanMasterRace
---
it has nothing to do with streamers getting bored
---
there are many in-game mechanics that don't get tested until the higher levels. the level cap *will* be raised.
---
Mage is just one button spam for pve mostly. They don't have fun procs or anything like BFA. 
---
Shaman totem quest at level 6 and 10 are worth it but from a leveling perspective the 20 and 30 quests don't give anything.
---
Mages can make some money worth portals but probably not as much as just farming but depends on the server.
---
I'm still of the belief the beta is for finding bugs. Crazy I know. Not really worried if they have 30 as the cap for 6 weeks to make sure the vast amount of early he content and base game bugs can be addressed.
---
Aint no way im subbing to play some stress test
---
yeah by capping it at 30 they make sure that all the instances and everything in that range is well tested, then they can increase to 40, 50 etc.
---
You can just buy poison mats. It's the leveling up your lock picking that will distract you.
---
That's how I've always looked at it, too. "Brb while I go do one of those things all humans must do."
---
Raise it to 40 in 3 more weeks. If 30 has gotten stale in 3 weeks. 40 is going to get even more stale if its available for 10 weeks.
---
looking at your current characters,
---
boomkin is viable but takes a hell of a lot of work and understanding that you will need to use cloth in some places as decent leather items just didn't exist with the stats you needed, this also means at time pissing off cloth users as you are taking kit they could use another good benefit of moonkin is the buff they bring so always nice to have one in a raid for that at least.
---
arcane mage i never really tried as i was fire for levelling and then frost for raiding but mage as a whole is a nice class to play.
---
not sure if ele shaman was viable or if it was like moonkin but i never saw one when i was raiding they were all resto, enh was good for pvp but i think windfury was a bit nerfed by 1.12 making less effective
---
ret pally if you are playing alliance i have heard mixed messages about but never played alliance in vanilla so have no reference.
---
if you wanted to branch out from what you currently play prot warrior for raids is normally in demand but it is a very involving role within the raid, dps warriors as off tanks are ok
---
rogues can be nice for damage as can locks but locks have no aggro drop so keep that in mind when playing you may well pull aggro a lot in raids and dungeons
---
priests are mostly healing in raids, saw one or two shadow but they were never very high on damage and often needed to off heal as well meaning time out of shadow form.
---
Yeah let man in, why not? Then me too please :)
---
This sub is so toxic it's nearly put me off of everything playing classic.  The elitism is ridiculous.  Screaming at other posters because they plan on tanking as other than warrior, not helping as a druid.  Rigid intolerance in this sub for sure.
---
Do the math, you're just wrong.
---
I don't know what to say to this other than I feel dumber for having read it.
---
Please look at my comment.
---
Yeah, that was my first thought.
---
An article came out a while ago talking about how Blizzard got so many bug reports for things like this that they had to say "these aren't bugs. This is how the game was in Classic. You just don't remember anymore."
---
lmfao
---
Hilarious and original
---
i didnt mean from a leveling perspective i just mean the whole trek of the water quest, even with a mount that was grueling
---
Please look at my comment, head post isn't my original image.
---
What else should I resub for? Bfa? ü§£
---
I can get behind this :)
---
Indeed. But most consider them quite the same, with viability only being driven by whether it's optimal or not.
---
Tank got bored and left.
---
*Cries in Prot*
---
\&gt; It's been a long time since I've played Classic WoW
---
Gee, who could've guessed? It's like I have a sixth sense for this sort of thing. An 80 IQ mongol could play Feral Tank, it's pitifully easy, but only 0.1% of the player base will be willing to grind out MCP. MCP... y'know the weapon that makes Feral Tanks ama... oh wait.
---
I guess I should change it to "Let US in"
---
&gt;where you just come online?
---
Define "coming online".
---
If you mean "AoEing down things like no tomorrow" as we are all used to from Retail, no, that never happens. You can do that once every few minutes with 3-4 mobs once you get Blade Flurry, but it's not what you do regularly.
---
From lvl 15 onward, the rogue is a steady, convenient leveling class however. You take one mob at a time, avoid larger packs, and stealth your way to objectives and isolated targets which you can quickly bring down. You know, like a stealthy, murderous, cheating, assassin is supposed to play (there is that class fantasy again :-) )
---
But will you get the same level of convenience as a Hunter, or a Warlock or Feral Druid? No, and you're not supposed to.
---
Did you read the post you're refuting? There are two fucking formulas in it.
---
You're arguing that a 305 weapon skill player should have a 7% chance to miss when in fact millions upon millions of combat logs show it's 6%.
---
I gave you the math, you clearly didn't read it.
---
FNF that have been playing since alpha already have a cap of 60. It will be raised in due time.
---
And this is why we have beta tests
---
A friend of mine and I once had a guild called "tank and healer lfg."
---
Well yes you need it since you can't cast water totems without it.
---
Its going to be a total guess I assume but does anyone know if there will be a few days of open beta before launch? It would be great to get a bit of time with a final version of the game to set up addons. ElvUI or equiv takes a good few hours to get right.
---
Thanks for the insight i just have a couple of questions
---
i like having a big role but i have never healed, i dont want to screw something up in raids. I have heard that the threat system is hugely different and is a ton harder to manage.
---
and is healing fun and viable for solo play, i plan to do most of my leveling alone.
---
&gt;Gee, who could've guessed?
---
Well, I was replying to you. 
---
\&gt; Looks like someone hasn't played Vanilla since 2006. 
---
\&gt; It's been a long time since I've played classic wow. Probably since right around the time TBC hit .
---
It's almost like a conversation if you read them together! But bears are a liability. You can make it work and I'm not saying they're bad or they're unplayable or that you likely smell like cheese, I'm only saying they are NOT close second. They're distant second.
---
People are good at different subjects. Being grammar nazi doesnt make you better person. I have limited time and I spend it on more important things. Being perfect in english is waste of time considered I use it 0.0001% of my time.
---
Also I dont believe you speak other language and if you do not as fluent as I speak my native ones. You are probably typical obese american with ego problems.

I hate how they have ridiculous exaggerated facial expressions on the front of their videos. Anything to get some ten year olds to click them. No shame at all

Hmm‚Ä¶ might be beneficial for me then, as I live in Thailand and ping to Oceanic servers is already 200 ms :)
---
He's the most wholesome streamer. Managed to stay pretty drama-free too as far as I know (Except from the DMCA you mention).
---
Really glad he can legitmently stream the game he loves.
---
but TukUi is apparently and its pretty similar
---
People have been doing this forever. It's the way to make warriors level faster than pala's and rogues. The circlejerk about how hard warrs are to level on this subreddit is so annoying.
---
but is is enough to dissuade me from not playing the class as a whole?
---
Does Questie track exp and gold per hour?  I also love Titan Critline that lets you know every time you get a new high crit record.
---
He's worthy of the hammer for sure. Cool fucking dude, funny and usually always smiling and educated af on the game. Just found him out recently when classic was at blizzcon, he was invited to come, stream and play it live there.
---
This is the truth, OP just had to much imagination about something they never said
---
I don't dislike streamers, I just don't care at all to watch them. At the end of the day it's like a reality TV show but video games and I'm just not interested in it.
---
&gt; , nothing to do with the gamer'skill.
---
Or the fact that this is lvl 30 :D
---
I think he's a mediocre player with a mediocre personality.
---
Damn dude, i bet you never lost an argument in your life. Maybe take some time to think about why that is? You're pretty pathetic dude.
---
People used addons in raids in vanilla
---
For the love of God I hope Classic is a success. Blizzard admitted that BC and Wrath legacy servers are likely based off of how Classic does.
---
I want Wrath back. I miss my ridiculously OP Threat of Thadsarian DW Frost DK and Art of War Exorcism spamming Ret Pally.
---
I miss Exorcism in general TBH.
---
This has an extra comment that is not visible. Someone is shadowbanned
---
You want to change your class bases on what happend at a lvl 30 tournament, and the actions of a few top players.
---
Sure, do that.
---
I am looking forward to some easy victims I can own with my Warlock :D
---
I heal pets alot even in retail, must be poor aoe threat.
---
But I also seen many pets pull extra packs so you got fucked there buddy.
---
I'm pretty sure that every spec is viable for the first half of the journey especially if you are part of the starting raids and part of the community (aka liked by many people).
---
I believe most players will play this game for the social aspect of it. This is also a liability as I'm sure that as we progress towards the harder and more consumable requiremented fights (AQ and onwards) the more players will 'quit' pve (not progress forward) and start focusing on another aspects of the game like alts or pvp.
---
However as more and more players will be decked in the best gears the BGs will start to feel like the twink fested lower brackets.
---
So I think it's kinda important to start early and experience the first 1-3 phases as it happens.
---
I've talked to him on voice chat personally so it might sound a bit biased but he is a cool guy. Streamers can have different personalities while live to appeal more to viewers by being more funny &amp; energetic. IRL he's more calm but still enthusiastic.
---
I don't watch his streams but the same goes for livestreams in general. Some of them have better intentions than others.
---
Recently modern wow players got banned for this. After using it for years. I Think they got some new detective programm finding out who does it.
---
So be aware, the bans were 6 months.
---
God. I want to listen to this podcast / other countdown to classic podcasts, but the presenter just comes across as sooo overly formal and non personable to me. Maybe its because I'm Australian, but he sounds like a reality tv presenter or something, which is awesome, but for a casual conversation about a game, I cringe comparing his tone of voice compared to the laid back guests. Or maybe he's just trying so hard to overly articulate words to make it audible for the rest of the world because the Aussie accent is literally the accent of drunk english prisoners, maybe its that ?
---
&gt;Does warlock pets get affected by paladin aura's on classic ?
---
Yes
---
&gt;Furthermore, does a hunter pets howl affect succubus/void/felhunter &amp; other hunters pets ?
---
It's very likely you leveled them with a suboptimal leveling spec as it makes a huge difference. Priest is both much easier and much faster. Shaman is plain faster. Paladin would be the best bet for someone as bad as warr - easier to do pala but just as slow or possibly sometimes slower
---
But we were all noobs back then and hadn't 15 years of knowledge because of pservers. You can't really compare vanilla and classic.
---
&gt;Also in general so many of them are toxic. My rogue alt...
---
They are not as toxic as rogues. Not even close. Pf course there are good and bad guys anywhere but it is always been the case that the worst human beings play rogues
---
Don't forget:  
---
Enemy Cast Bar  
---
KLH Threat Meter
---
It really has not been clarified. They said that +5 weapon skill makes you ignore the first 1% of +hit gained from talents or gear against bosses. 
---
Question is: does this mean +5 weapon skill basically adds just 1 hit, or it adds 1 hit on top of its regular benefits (which are also unknown right now, but might include additional hit?).
---
For reference this is how weapon skill impacts miss chance and glance damage on private servers:
---
|skill|miss|glance|
---
--:|--:|--:|
---
|300|**8,6**|65|
---
|301|**8,2**|70,18|
---
|302|**7,8**|74,69|
---
|303|**7,4**|78,6|
---
|304|**7,0**|82,03|
---
|305|**6,6**|85|
---
|306|**6,5**|87,59|
---
|307|**6,4**|89,84|
---
|308|**6,3**|91,8|
---
|309|**6,2**|93,51|
---
|310|**6,1**|95|
---
|311|**6,0**|96,29|
---
|312|**5,9**|97,42|
---
|313|**5,8**|98,4|
---
|314|**5,7**|99,26|
---
|315|**5,6**|100|
---
So first 5 weapon skill basically adds 2 hit, but additional weapon skill helps as well for hit (although not as much as first +5 adds). We need a table like this for classic basically, then we can call it clarified.
---
Sure, and if we played with our eyes closed, it'd be even harder still!
---
Addons give precise knowledge, that's it. They allow you to play without guessing.
---
Having to guess in a game about numbers isn't more fun.
---
The quest is long but its incredibly important so if you really don't like the running you might want a different class.
---
So it has minimal to no effect on avoidance rates? Does this also apply to defense skill for tanks for example?
---
It seems like weapon skill vs. defense skill greatly affects glancing blows and adds 1% hit chance because of some strange code that only applies to mobs 3+ levels higher. From what I've read here there doesn't seem to be anything beneficial beyond than that, tangibly speaking. 
---
Still means that weapon skill is very very good (especially once you hit 305) but it doesn't affect everything the way we thought it did.
---
I'd say toughen up cause people are assholes. Remember them so you can not invite them to your raid later.
---
&gt; Also I dont believe you speak other languages 
---
Du kannst nat√ºrlich glauben was du willst, mein Kleiner, aber das √§ndert nichts daran dass du grade √ºbelst vorgef√ºhrt wurdest ;-)
---
You can polish a turd all day long but in the end it's still a piece of shit.
---
There were plenty of useful add-ons already in Vanilla. Sure, not out of the gate, but later on there were a lot of them.
---
Why people consider it being much easier, is that there is little mystery about the fights. And for the people who have been involved in (high end) raiding, the encounters (with all their mechanics) will be familiar. Now if you take 40 people who have not done a lot of farming or are totally new to the game, it will still be hard as fuck. Wipefest!
---
Do you invite shamans, druids and paladins? Those also roll on cloth. If its an upgrade for you you should roll on it, this is vanilla and your best items might not be of your armor type. Fury warriord might roll on mail and leather too. Thats how it works.
---
Unless you have a super secret spec that the community has never seen I did it optimally. Warrior is just a very strong class if you can navigate the tough situations.
---
And that's to be on par with warriors/rogues that barely use consumes. Those who do are running circles around him.
---
Sure, your level 60 fury war guide will tell you to not use those abilities. Which is entirely irrevelant to this conversation as we're specifically talking about leveling. A guide that tells you to not use rend pre Whirlwind (lvl 36) and pre MS/BT (level 40) is a really bad guide. Feel free to follow them.
---
Do you think you are the only one who just want to change 1-2 things? Its like opening the box of pandora
---
Thanks, I needed to hear bass boosted meme music and screaming from nobodies today.
---
Duels don't mean shit. You're not taking WPvP situations into consideration. If you're good, prepared and just a bit lucky, you can win your 1v1s in open world pvp with any class.
---
he's convincing people to play ret pallies, who are free HKs.
---
no complaints from me
---
He's cool. I don't watch him though
---
DBM shouldn't be necessary for the first phase for anyone that's raided MC before. IMO just 1 person (raid leader) should have it to whisper the dumdums and call the timers.
---
ChatMOD is one i always like to have, colours names based on class and has click invite if people say a keyword or "inv, invite, etc"
---
DrDamage is one i hope can be back/forward ported from BC, put loads of info on tooltips like effective healing/damage, DPM/HPM, DPS/HPS, +stat coefficient, etc.
---
Itemrack is another that's super helpful for changing gearsets.
---
It's funny how that probably sucked at the time but is a fond memory now.
---
A lot of replies saying you‚Äôre wrong but nobody is actually explaining to me why
---
It's quite easy to tell. Do you get dazed? No? Then it's an animation error.
---
I raided in vanilla and everyone used dbm and omen. So people still using it isn't somehow stronger. 1.12 isn't the latch those early raids were released on so the constant changes over the years made them pretty silly. MC was basically a joke for a long time once people just used fire res and fire pots for rag.
---
They said they wanted new unique server names to avoid confusion. And Im glad about that.
---
Maked se searching on youtube for server specific videos more easy.
---
And now you show your true colour. Your just a spoiled little prick that thinks everyone should play the way he want them to. I main a hunter and am not guilty of any of these things you accuse us of. But given your attitude I glad you won't be grouping with hunters. One less ballbag to worry about.
---
That's not how it's going to work. All items will be in their 1.12 state, but items won't start dropping until the corresponding phase/patch they were originally implemented in. This means no Eye of Sulfuras or bonus MC loot like Talisman of Ephemeral Power and no "new" dungeon loot like Animated Chain Necklace until phase 2, no Bindings of the Windseeker until phase 3 etc.
---
Was that the game that was canceled because it was outsourced to some absolutely incompetent developer that basically copypasted the entire game code for each different screen in the game?
---
Ah alright. Then I'm curious to see the bug reports!
---
It doesn't daze so it's just an animation error with no gameplay consequence. Doesn't change anything other that it's not pretty
---
Hahhaha dead
---
Fleshed out addons do help alot. But don't forget the other reasons:
---
1. All the data has been there for a very long time, studies, compiled. We will have youtube guides for each boss etc (not just mechanical, but what stats should tanks go for and such)
---
2. Better computers and internet: having 60fps and 30ms on your 1920p monitor is way better than what people had back in the day.
---
None of the possibilities, next.
---
The only one who got "fucked" here is you, since you apparently went off rambling about something that had nothing to do with the subject matter (who was talking about heal?).
---
Also, you keep confusing Classic and Retail, and apparently never read any tooltips.
---
No way you can fit 400 games into a backpack.
---
Bro üôÅ
---
Private servers havnt had much numbers to go by so they have been guessing for the most part.
---
Those types of total shitters won't be in top guilds where racials can make a difference. 
---
I find it so annoying when bad players talk about racials being super important. They are if you have no other areas to improve. You'll see a bigger performance increase by learning where best to stand, when to use cool downs / potions, minimising movement. The fact is 95%+ players simply aren't good enough to make racials make a significant difference
---
More like Thrallmart
---
Worth watching: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM)
---
On Horde side you may see up to 8 shamans in a raid, few priests, bit less druids. Pretty much there is always need for whatever healers you can get. There are that would be most beneficial but often than not you have to make compromises - not every group will have a shaman etc.
---
Venruki isn‚Äôt that good at classic wow. After watching him play several times myself and other mages notice he makes tonnes of misplays and doesn‚Äôt ice block correctly either.  He‚Äôs very good at retail though
---
The vanilla premise simply revolves around cleansing the mutated filth that is the horde.
---
i love how the entangling roots go straight to entangling that orcs root
---
THEY WILL OR WE RIOT
---
Ghost Wolf alone causes Shamans to pull ahead significantly. You need to weigh movement speed equally with kill speed and downtime because you spend so much time just running from place to place. Not to mention they get a second hearthstone, which isn't as significant but helps.
---
If that one ability was busted in vanilla timeline and it wasn't fixed at any point before tbc then it doesn't have place in classic during the vanilla content. The moment Blizzards touches something and changes the class balance they send a message that your character is as unsafe as in private servers. You don't have the knowledge which classes shine after 6 months even if you knew what the content is like.
---
Some people are coming to classic with the knowledge on how things will turn out and that has been their major factor for choosing the right class for them. If you take that away from them. Isn't the server just like a private server if you live in uncertainty that will you have that account still tomorrow or will it be gone? Then why would those people choose to pay for that product if they can't trust it.
---
The period of uncertainty is for after vanilla timeline. Blizzard may choose then what they want to do with a failing product (mmorpg that doesn't get more content and people who played it throughly will quit). Is it time for fresh take on vanilla experience: playing fresh content while knowing that your class may be under the radar for reworking and small tuning to make it work better or nerfing.
---
Right now if they try to please some people, they will just end up pissing more people. They can truly try a change later when it doesn't matter anymore if whether people would leave since they would have left month later anyways.
---
i had a friend in vanilla that levelled purely as a disc priest, mostly questing but also in dungeons with us, it took him a little longer to do quests but its not impossible, if you do druid you have wrath and starfire to help you kill stuff while being able to heal same with shaman you still have lightning bolt and chain lightning to help kill things so its viable to level as a healer just know you wont kill as fast as a dps but you are less likely to die from over pulling and silly mistakes than say a mage.
---
threat isn't that hard to manage as long as you dont pop everything you have on pull like you can in BFA warriors like to 3-5 sunder armour as a guide to when you can start to up your dps, cant remember what druids had that was the same as sunder armour but pretty sure they had a skill that caused a lot of threat and gave a debuff
---
It does concern aoe. I healed pets several times vanilla like I said.
---
That is not even main concern. Its fact that hunters cant CONTROL THEIR PETS.
---
Fine. I'll take your word for it.
---
Like I said I dont want to risk my game experience for few.
---
I bet you're gonna sperg out when holy paladins roll on cloth, too.
---
Yes, they can. I played a Hunter troughout TBC. Controlling your pet is one of the primary things you learn how to do early if you are serious about your class.
---
Normally, I would say "sorry you experienced some bad hunters", but given your attitude, and the paired likelyhood that you are no better than the people you played with, I won't. Because it's likely you got exactly the kind of people in your group that you deserve :P
---
You could roll Druid and have the option to heal or tank. Druid is a fun class for doing both of those, and feral may get a spot in some raids while resto will give you a good opportunity to get tier gear in pugs.
---
YES
---
If they are healer they can roll cloth for sure. It is rarity to see them roll for offspec.
---
Hunter on other hand roll everything for their "mainspec".
---
That video gives me chills every time I see it. The french voice acting fits so well!
---
&gt;pet becomes unhappy after BG finishes 
---
Man, don't we all
---
Nah he's saying bullshit. The 0.2s of spell batching have no impact. If anything, hamstring kite is a bit less effective because emobs path better and keep more uptime on you, but it's still so much better than staying on the spot.
---
Didnt he make classic wow videos prior to classic announcement? Or what do you mean by the bandwagon
---
There were addons that made first bosses in MC easy as hell.
---
For example; There was a decurse addon that decursed anyone in the raid that had a curse, without you targeting them.
---
So you just spammed your keybind and it automatically decursed someone if they had a curse, otherwise it didnt. 
---
It made curses trivial, as they were removed on the whole raid within 5 sec. 
---
Cant remember the name. Decursive maybe?
---
&gt; they want your healings, not feelings
---
These are wounds that even Holy Light can't heal.
---
Okay
---
40 man dungeon raids were originally possible in original WoW, this was changed in an early patch (I don't remember the specific number). Since classic is using 1.12 as a base, dungeons have the specific player limits noted above.
---
HELL YEAH! :D
---
Both grindstones ready and accounted for!
---
I'd toss my Rogue/Druid alts into for sure.
---
Apps such as discord will provide a much easier way to form and organize groups so I‚Äôm expecting to see a large amount of pugs once DM is out and some of the more hardcore guilds have MC on farm.
---
E.g. for priest if you even just had spirit tap and wand spec both at 5/5 i dont see how could you possibly have had a  harder and slower process than with warrior. Unless you were doing something weird like only using rank 1 spells or dungeons only.
---
You don't need to take my word for it. There's proof in the video i posted from the beta.
---
Why you don‚Äôt have auto-shot on your bars?

---
No one "hates" paladins as a whole. We just hate paladins that don't understand that their role in Vanilla WoW was to heal and act as buff bots. 
---
Do whatever you want in dungeons, outdoor content, or pvp...a ret or tanking paladin is not wanted in raid environments. Will ret paladins be taken to raids? Probably a handful, sure. But they will forever be outclassed and it is known they are easily outclassed. With this knowledge why take a ret paladin that doesn't want to fulfill the class's role as a true support when you can take another fury warrior that will out dps the ret paladin that just wants to auto attack the raid boss.
---
People also keep trying to theorycraft builds for a 15 year old game that has had its builds figured out already. Spent a week on this subreddit and see all the people asking "is my build viable?" The unwashed masses will say play whatever you want, and those that have looked into the specs and have played on *those* servers will tell you that sadly Vanilla WoW was a time of rock, paper, scissor balancing and not everything was viable. We have figured out what specs are viable and anyone not running said spec will not be taken seriously or considered. This then goes back to what I previously stated, people don't hate paladins (or balance druids, or shadow priests, or ele/enh shamans), people take players that don't understand that some classes only have a few worthy specs and those must be played to be considered. Yes, some non-viable specs will be taken because at a certain point raid leaders just need bodies to fill the 40 slots, but those raid leaders will generally take what the community deems viable first and foremost. Meme specs and non team players come second.
---
&gt; He's the most wholesome streamer. 
---
More than Madseason?
---
What guild were you in? I was briefly in sociopath then phantom legion.
---
It was canceled very close to completion because it wasn't up to Blizzard's standards.
---
It's playable and can be fun. Although obviously it's average quality at best for a point and click adventure.
---
What do you mean? 
---
Wasn't [keyrings introduced in 1.11.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Keyring)?
---
That's my comment and if you read it again, it says dungeons *used* to allow 40-man raids. 
---
In patch 1.3, with the release of Dire Maul (a 5-man capped dungeon), every other dungeon got capped at 10 except UBRS and LBRS which were capped at 15.
---
In patch 1.10, UBRS and LBRS became capped at 10 and BRD, Strat, and Scholo became capped at 5.
---
We're playing patch 1.12.
---
I'll take relevant priv server players' word &gt; random K3 speed runner's word.
---
\&gt; But have never experienced the Alliance side. Never been in any city's.  
---
I played both, started as Alliance (lv 60 warlock) then switched. Even if my hearth is with the Horde, I would surely regret if I hadn't had those experiences (cities, questing zones). If I were you I would definitely choose Alliance, just for those reasons.
---
Not that I recall. Maybe you're thinking of Sunken Temple?
---
Ah I see, that makes a lot of sense, I wonder why they changed it in the first place?
---
To fatten up the boars for eating, obviously. He gives you 10 cactus apples so you can make your 5 daily meals. 2 Boars for breakfast, 2 Boars for second breakfast, 2 Boars for brunch, 2 Boars for lunch and 2 Boars for dinner.
---
but thats not true at all. Read the patc notes. 1.3 changed so all dungeons had a 10 player cap. 1.10 changed Strat, Scholo and BRD to a 5 player cap, but left the others alone. I literally linked the patch notes.
---
To be honest I find all languages useless and dumb as fuck. 
---
Would been better if my native was english but since its you deal with cards you have.
---
Would you be happy to not only learn swedish but also russian just because you used to be under their power in history?
---
They both uploaded pvp videos where they fight and win against two alliance players, but edited in the same cheesy way they used to be back in the day, complete with thumping soundtrack, and pixelated zoom-ins on big damage numbers and clutch plays.
---
The "fun detected" meme is painfully true concerning Blizzard and toys. 
---
They just genuinely do not want you to be /too/ happy with the game.
---
Read the patch notes I posted. This is incorrect. It is documented that ONLY Strat, Scholo and BRD are to be capped to 5 players. All the leveling dungeons should be capped to 10.
---
Watch Savix's VoD
---
I personally never use thunderclaps except extremely situationally in dungeons when I need to diminish tank damage and I'm not tanking. But you're definitely wrong on rend. It costs ten rage, while heroic strike costs 14 + the rage generated by an auto attack, and the additional dmg from hs is not bigger than rend's. However, I sometimes use hs to diminish my miss chances when I'm gonna die if I don't kill the mob for exemple.
---
Yeah.. would be as if Nintendo would rerelease any of their old games .... oh wait they did.
---
Okay, lets say a Final Fantasy 7 remake .. oh wait, that is happening.
---
Of course youcan compare it to things.
---
&gt;I always thought its just a base Chance and it's for everybody the same.
---
Not quite. Yes, there is a base chance, but there is no "diminishing return" aka. "normalized proc rate" as we have in retail.
---
Simply put, the more often you hit a mob, the higher the uptime of, say, the Nightfall Debuff, you can provide.
---
Enhancers can hit a mob very often, thanks to windfury procs.
---
I would say "optimal" are the Top 3 DPS Specs 
---
In my definition "viable" would be the Specs that are a little worse than that 
---
"Not viable" are, specs which make no sense in PvE like Oomkin, Ret and Spriest early end game
---
Nope they can gladly roll if they heal. I hardly ever see ret roll for heal items.
---
Hunters on other hand main everything.
---
A fun prank they enabled later in MoP was giving mages the ability to make a portal to 'Ancient Dalaran'. What this did was teleport anyone who took the portal high above Dalaran Crater, usually resulting in their death from fall damage if they lacked any fall speed reduction spells.
---
What made this great is that it had both the same spell icon and portal graphic as the normal Dalaran did, and nobody seemed to ever bother checking.
---
gz, you just answered your own Q ^^
---
I dont dislike them. Really makes no difference in early raids
---
It was in by 1.12 and was extremely grindy to get. I believe TBC made it significantly easier.
---
How? Do you think people actually use CTRL buttons? There is macro for that and people dont use it. 
---
They just keep pet defensive = gg.
---
Boomkin isnt viable or if it is then every single spec in the game is ad there are few that are worse..
---
Sorry, my bad. For some reason I thought you meant back in vanilla rather than back in one of the pre-1.12 patches. All cleared, thanks for the help!
---
Litteraly unplayable
---
Lots masochists want to play ret for some reason and get carried.
---
On top of that jackasses like Esfand and McConnel play ret and never shut up about how awesome they they are despite doing little to no dmg and running out of Mana constantly.
---
I have never heard of sharting before now, but this sounds like a convincing point.
---
What AH situation are you talking about? What resources from the starting zones will have huge impact on the economy?????
---
Really just saying ‚Äùmake no sense‚Äù is not a VIABLE argument
---
ILLEGAL ACTIVITY DETECTED
---
SEND THEM TO THE GULAGS
---
Snutz is insanely good. He might have been nervous, tired, just made a mistake etc. He might have been planning something that he thought he could get away with that didn't work. (Saving cooldowns).
---
Your goal should be to gear hit for yellow cap (9%) not the much higher not-attainable white cap. Any +hit past 9% is good, but not essential (unless you need it to cancel out critcap due to excessive gear/worldbuffs/consumables, which you will once you get AQ40/Naxx BIS).
---
OK, so it will be in this coming classic to then? As I think I read they will use 1.12, but also a mix of other later patches, which made me confused.
---
Thank you very much! I really appreciate it
---
Leave it at 40 until release??
---
So no endgame testing, yeah I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll work out great &lt;,&lt;
---
It will be in, no doubt.
---
Shadow Oil is better than Windfury if you get all the available buffs to spell power.
---
Thanks for this guide, I was looking for something like this. Do you have an ETA when it will appear in the spreadsheet of pingaan?
---
Yeah, I wanted to edit the title and put an Ear Rape warning on it but Reddit is awesome and doesn't let you edit the title after 5 milliseconds from your original post time
---
I still check the drop down menu in the launcher everyday sigh
---
Why am I not good enough for you Blizzard /cry
---
Yes, I have no idea why the people going for stuff like SM Cathedral on beta didn't try to 10 man it.
---
Because ret paladins in BGs giving themselves freedom
---
It's a level 30 beta duel tournament...if that's what makes you pick one class over another then you are easily impressed. Don't get me wrong, there were tons of great duels and great players, but in the end this was a very small sample size and Venruki did get lucky by not having to face a druid/more casters in the tournament. Every class is different at 60 so take this tournament with a grain of salt.
---
Yes we can.
---
Firstly, most people who play classic will not be PServer experienced. This sub gives a skewed impression, because according to the posters themselevs, everyone here either has been playing on PServers for years, or cleared Naxxramas in Vanilla, or both.
---
In Reality, statistical fact is, most people started late in TBC or early-to-mid Wrath, and most of them played retail wow rather than PServers.
---
There will be a very small number of elite players in Classic.  
---
There will be a very small number of very bad players in Classic.  
---
And there will be a very large number of average players in Classic.
---
**\*Preachin voice\***: _Thus it has always been, in every game, across all times. And thus it shall be again!_
---
And secondly, a lot of players in Vanilla weren't unexperienced at all. A lot of us came from Everquest, DAoC or (shudder) Neocron2. Compared to those balls-to-the-walls grindfests, Vanilla WoW was actually a very relaxed and simple game.
---
I wonder if this counts as cross faction collusion, which is not permitted by blizzard. I'm actually curious.
---
Yeah and they will cry when we will not invite them in dungeons. Its only place they can enter since there is hardly spot for raids to them eather. If you roll that shitty class you deserve it.
---
to make booze
---
This is why the addon question doesn't really matter- everyone should play exactly how they want :)
---
Including those that want to exploit layering while it lasts.
---
"Blizzard will add non vanilla content to classic"
---
I just want him to scream out FUUUUUCK!
---
Maybe if he gets wrecked or an item gets honked from him.
---
Frick 1000 times makes me cry.
---
Level 30 + one of the best pro pvpers in the world. I wouldn't get too excited about mage (unless you enjoy mage more, of course).
---
god i hope they have time to fix this stuff before release
---
Gamespot did one as well, lol. So crazy to watch this and soon we will get to experience it!

congratulations on promoting certain streamers again and again and again in this subreddit.. the pay must be good
---
I'll take windfury over those filthy blessings any day, even as a caster. I might change my mind on TBC tho
---
Not really. Pserver players were trying to say a lot of things were wrong with Classic, then Blizzard came in and confirmed that Pservers actually had incorrect values due to missing server-side data that only Blizzard knew about. So while a lot of the sub clowned on them with memes a little bit for being arrogant, hardly anyone was actually hating on them.
---
DrDamage had a Vanilla counterpart called Theorycraft.
---
This is literally me.
---
Boy really needs to choose a haircut and transmog and stick with it.
---
I don't think they will.
---
IF Classic is a success, they will draw conclusions from it, and incorporate those conclusions into some future game.
---
I do not think they will change Classic, as their entire marketing strategy depends on the "we are giving you back what you wanted" narrative. It would bode badly for the "we are listening" impression they are trying to build, if they faltered in that regard.
---
Looking forward to play wow again as my sub ran out, am not gonna sub to some jackpot sim
---
Wtb grind
---
You are going to blacklist a whole clasd because of a meme. You do realize that &gt; 50% of hunter players eould have already maimed a different class right? This generalization is just stupid.
---
Anyway, i dont mind griefing but i do think that players like you are bad for the game and hope you'll switch to another game before 60.
---
I was in a lot of guilds back in the day, and Phantom Legion was one of them!  What was your character name?
---
Warforce Clan, Chaotic Embrace, Nightmare's Asylum, and Wicked Tempest to name a few.
---
nah im saying he's on a pserver and not closed beta. Was a joke
---
Cannot wait.
---
I wrote out an essay to explain this. Reddit lost it.. sooo.. [heres a link..](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Procs_per_minute)
---
&gt; It would have the potential to kill the hype. 
---
What?.. It wont kill "the hype".
---
So you¬¥re saying its better to leave the whole range from 40-60 untested so users can encounter several bugs at release?
---
Yes, people actually use Ctrl. You know how I know that? Because I did. I even remember exactly where I bound all the Pet-Bar-Ability Macros to: C-1 was Attack, C-2 was Growl, C-3 was Pet-Return+Passive stance.
---
&gt;They just keep pet defensive = gg.
---
That's what bad Hunters do. Most Hunters are not bad.
---
For endgame pve for sure, but for dungeons and low tier raids 1-1 gimmick specs could work. Optimal? Definitely not? Can pull it's weight? With the dedication of most, it's unlikely. But not everyone planning to serverfirst the raids heck I'm pretty sure most don't even plan to set foot in AQ40. Not everyone wants to play a raid with 35 warriors and a few healers because it's proved to be the fastest for clears... Most players would prefer a more balanced setup as gearing is better that way. The plus cleartime is a nonexisting problem, if you enjoy your time in raids.
---
The tryhard searching for efficiency and min-maxing is killing the spirit of vanilla for me when it's more than doable without it.
---
I just tuned in to him for the first time. Yes, he‚Äôs a total douche bag, but I legitimately enjoyed his stream. The fact that non rpg streamers like him and Summit are playing the beta is hyping me up more than I already was.
---
Tukui is ported to Classic client so I'll just use that.
---
Clumsy but very wholesome streamer. Fun to watch for those who want chill steam but there are other chill streamers who are much more competent
---
Disagree. I said I wont ruin my gaming experience for few because majority are bad. Next time pay attention how hunters pet behave and you will see pattern.
---
Not really, they can raid early raid content just fine, and late content too with dedication
---
Current price I pay is zero. If I want WoW Classic, I have to pay $15 and get forced bundling of a game I have no interest in. They are bundling useless crap with Classic and rising the price. They might as well throw in Diablo and Hearthstone cards and whatever else and charge even more. It's precisely the same thing. The fact that you cannot see this simple reality just shows why this exploiting tactic works.
---
Pressing a MORE buttons! 
---
But really though leveling as a rogue is a lot more engaging because of combo points.
---
I think you‚Äôre confusing the no changes crowd with yourself
---
Cyanide Poison Reminder, otherwise I constantly forget poisons on my rogue. Sadly that means getting off my arse and rewriting it cause it stopped working in Legion.
---
Why I should ruin my gaming experience? I will have fun time with my healer. I will make tank friends and encourage them to blacklist hunters too so they cant steal their weapons.
---
Have you listed addons you've used on private servers?
---
Asking because of the familiar names and the fact that they run on an older iteration of Blizzard's Lua.
---
Or all of them are already ported to the current Classic client?
---
The way you make it sound calculated... Oh he earns 3m p/a so the net worth is 2mil.
---
I'm glad I could help :) no, I dont know when it'll be available, but he is working on it.
---
Who are these people who must specifically play an MMO, regardless of price or quality or the game? I have certain free time, I will seek the best value for money entertainment for that time. Vanilla at $15/month does not provide that, 5$/month would. It's not that complicated.
---
&gt;when we will not invite them in dungeons. 
---
I have got news for you:
---
With your attitude towards other players, paired with the lack of understanding of base machanics **the "we" you are refering to, will be YOU, and you alone.** And YOU will get blacklisted by the community of your entire server.
---
So Hunters won't care if you don't wanna play with them, because no one will want to play with you anyway, if you keep up what you show here ingame.
---
It should be 5g per 8000xp. even quests at the level 30 cap can give several gold. If you do a lot of grinding to 60 and dont complete every quest, doing 55+ quest hubs will net you quite a lot and it is pure, raw currency.

&gt;On private servers its worse because there aren't any consequences to those actions, not really.

This. It's why I hate most f2p games. You'll get wayyy more toxicity since there are no real repercussions, especially to children who have time to burn.
---
1. Jumping at the edge of boats/zeps and saying ‚Äúwtf they added a barrier‚Äù
---
2. Hunter eyes of the beast in opposing faction starter zones and path my pet like a mob. Toggle walk, move a few feet forward. Stop. Double mouseclick 180¬∞, repeat.
---
As healer I will make tank friends and I encourage them to blacklist them too and give my reasons.
---
Im sure they will be happy when hunters cant roll their melee weapons :)
---
as some that was in a guild with a boomkin on a server where 2 of the top guilds also had boomies i would have to say they are, they will never top damage but they boost everyone else's damage as well as bringing a decent amount of their own, if you played it and found it not viable you probably weren't paying it well but from personal experience they were used.
---
Bruh nobody wanted to tank in vanilla. Or heal. It was so bad Blizzard instituted those "bonus rewards" for anyone willing to do it in the dungeon and raid finder. 
---
Nowadays people do it because it's stupidity easy. I've never seen a tank lose aggro or healer OOM in like, years.
---
This is ridiculous. You don‚Äôt think the generation of Quake, Counter Strike, Starcraft and Warcraft were good enough players to properly theorycraft and play World of Warcraft? Maybe you were 12 years old back then but most of us weren‚Äôt.
---
You can disagree as much as you want, doesn't change the fact that you are wrong :D

Is there anyone bad WITH a healer?

Don‚Äôt talk shit on the country that has given your everything and civilized you, filthy peasant. 
---
What country are you from? Some shithole we bailed out at some point for biting off more then you can chew?
---
"Viable" is generally considered for builds you can finish content with. You can with all of them.  By your definition having hunters is not optimal. Having rogues later on isn't either since furies/fmages (because of the ignite one)/locks are ahead.
---
Are them far from optimal? Sure, but that's not the matter. 
---
"Make no sense"... Then, you're pointing out Blizzard trolled these classes' players? Otherwise, why do them exist?
---
It took me 3 or 4 episodes to warm up to him, I felt basically the same way at first, but once you get a chance to see a little more of his personality, I think you'll change how you feel. It's just kind of a character he plays.

You are not going to ruin your gaming experience... This is just bs.

You are most definitely ruining other players' experience though, no question there.
---
You're talking about this line in the EULA:
---
&gt; Rules Related to "Chat" and Interaction With Other Users.
---
&gt; When engaging in Chat, you may not:
---
&gt; (vii) Communicate directly with players who are playing characters aligned with the opposite faction (e.g. Horde communicating with Alliance or vice versa)
---
Which was removed some time in 2012. There's now a potion you can drink in Retail that allows you to comprehend the other faction.
---
Now it's just:
---
&gt; Harassment, ‚Äúgriefing,‚Äù abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others
---
Cross faction collusion is 100% allowed.
---
Hey, Kiazzara! It's Zez, I was just grouped with you.
---
Thankful for your quiver 2H. We couldn't have ran WC without it, and you.
---
Can confirm. Was deep into a mob zone and a druid ran up behind me and disappeared. He/she sent me an invite and I accepted, I was transfered to the layer he/she phased into only to then find the druid had been slaughtered by the heap of minions in the new layer - and all those minions spawned around started to wack me to death. I would have died if I hadn't hoofed it.
---
An isolated incident, but when you have .01% occurrences happening hundreds of different ways across a population; it adds up.
---
That‚Äôs honestly the safest course of action, and my proposal to ‚Äúretune‚Äù Classic for its original feel is a risky thing to do. No matter what you do people will be angry if anything is changed, and it‚Äôs not like any kind of small retune will go unnoticed. It will be, greatly. However, it is my opinion that such a risk is warranted if the content is so easy it can be zerged through which is not authentic to what Classic really was for near 2 years s
---
Math genius thought Sodapoppin on Druid would beat Snutz on Lock, LMFAO.
---
&gt;Attend every raid or you're effectively fucked.
---
This would only be true if you, also, only care about BIS. So why are you criticising others for that?
---
No, you won't, because people will not care if you are a healer, a tank or Jesus Christ himself...if you have a crappy attitude towards others, they will ignore you, period.
---
Classic is not retail. You are part of a closed community on your server. If you piss off that community, for example by raging against an entire class, while having next to no knowledge about the class or even basic mechanics, then it's YOU who gets blacklisted.
---
Plus, and I am sure by this point that you don't even know that:  
---
Hunters are REQUIRED for raids. Good luck trying Magmadr with a fresh raid, or any other Boss who got an enrage (there are ALOT of them :D) without a Hunter who can dispell it with Tranquilizing Shot.
---
In case you didn't know, and I am sure you didn't:  
---
Hunters are the ONLY class that can dispell Enrage in Classic .P
---
&gt; bow specialization is not reason to go troll over Orc
---
Berserking, on the other hand, is. For pure PvE Orc does not have anything pretty much. Racial gives melee AP, Pet Damage is irrelevant in rads since as a hunter you use a wolf to howl for AP, not for damage.
---
&gt;Gaming asways has been "toxic" in the eyes of some people.
---
Yep. Even back in Vanilla a very common request was for "18+ servers" as if all the trolls were 5th graders.
---
Still waiting on an explanation how layering would be cheaper and not result it in less players per zone.
---
This grind will be there and it is insane. Not R14 insane, but still firmly in the realm of madness. The change around BC was that you'd get five times as much XP as you got in Vanilla, which was then made even easier later on.
---
In Classic this will take 840 quest turn-ins at around 15-20 mins completion time each. That means this takes **somewhere between 200 and 300 hours**. Or three months of three hours of farming per day **at least**. And it's not the fun kind of farming, this shit is tedious. 
---
I plan to get it eventually, but not until I have absolutely nothing better to do in the game. Trying to get this mount server first is practically the same as deciding to mow the lawn instead of taking up your neighbors BBQ invitation.
---
&gt; and main reason to choose Orc again, for tanking, in Classic.
---
I am doing the same thing, though for a different reason. But tell me - how many tank weapons are axes? Annihilator in Phase 1 is really good, but other than that?
---
Isn't this like in every other episode? That's literally a running joke, there's no just "single episode" that has it so it's very likely you "just saw it" if you're watching the show.
---
I was also the MT.

Well, I won't assume anything, that's the whole point. You're assuming 15k+ players based on nothing.

There's times where it is needed. This doesn't make a ret bad. Tunnel vision into big seal of the casino critz sure does.

so 1.12 is before they normalised the procs? never played enh so wasn't sure if it was in vanilla or after

My bad. In my defense, ruin is more important for that build than the whole af tree though :p I just didnt think he wanted to spam shadowbolts, which maybe was stupid.
---
I dont know for sure if any of these are Alliance or Horde only, but this kind of stuff might be worth looking into for you. There could be more, but these are what I ran into a while ago so I saved them as part of a larger spreadsheet.
---
\- Dartol's Rod of Transformation turns you into a furbolg like you said.
---
\- The Really Stickly Glue renders a target unable to move (good for PvP or Hunter quest or taming hard mobs)
---
\- The Mechanical Yeti acts like a pet and can be very helpful on certain tough quests, for example Benediction quest for priests (one time use only I think though, but worth saving for something special).
---
My mistake then
---
If you are a master of the kite you can blowup most classes anyway. It just takes twice as long. dont go toe to toe and fullon offensive and you be fine. Shaman is so versatile. That doesnt mean you will rek T2 people coming down on you but Shamans are really tanky. Lucky crits and you drop their hp fast enough.
---
90% of the people in the beta early on were streamers, half never even played wow. The beta is just as much publicity as it is for finding bugs
---
I was a clicker for years , it definitely holds you back. 
---
I then bought a razer naga and never looked back. It honestly changed the game completely for me. It takes a little time to get used to the muscle memory but once that‚Äôs in your head it‚Äôs amazing.

I only said that because majority of grammarcops come from your country and preach while they only have to one language. Its just ego problems. You may have inventions but you have shitty healthcare, students drowning in dept and homelessness. You celebrate weekends with school shootings because you cant give up your guns while example in Japan its extreme rarity.
---
this beta doesn't feel like its for bug finding, more free marketing and if bugs are found its a bonus, lets be fair though most of the bugs are minor from where they are running it on the current software as most of the bugs from vanilla were known about before the beta
---
Can you make one for NA and EU. I think it will make things easier. Awesome work ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I am not sure about this, tbh with you.
---
I know that swing-timer-AP normalization was in 1.8, but that's about it. Based purely on memory from way back when, I am about 80% sure that procs were not normalized within the lifetime of Vanilla.
---
If someone here has more accurate information, I am more than happy to absorb that knowledge :D
---
Haha - I love it ü§©
---
I've always used razor nagas. For most things in wow you can just use a keyboard but classic has so many spells that are very situational but I still want them bound so I use 1-9 on my naga and shift + ctrl
---
Jup the poll is kinda limited with choices..
---
I"ll wait until Classic goes live to resub, but I'll 100% be grinding some classic private servers to prepare. Now which class....
---
The good ol days ü§©
---
You dont really need a gaming mouse. Keyboard instead of clicking is all that's important. Thumb buttons are nice but not needed. I dont even assign them on all classes.
---
I understand if you are using it for a motivation to switch though. It can be easier to break the pattern if you are changing other stuff at the same time as the mouse itself.

Specc is slightly different from your (it takes lower cast time on starfire over reduced mana cost).
---
Depends:
---
Are you the one holding it in your hand? Very fun.
---
Are you the one holding the other end with your face? Not fun at all.
---
Learn how to keyboard turn for that true classic experience.
---
In classic ... there were no addons in the beginning. If you want the real experience? Don't install them... my opinion.
---
Which country are you from?
---
Haha we have shitty healthcare and and students?
---
The list of top universities in the world are almost all entirely American, not to mention we have access to some of the worlds best advances in healthcare. 
---
If you mean our healthcare system and university loan system is bad, then you‚Äôre correct. 
---
We do have those problems, but we are still dramatically ahead of the rest of the world.
---
I have a 24 button gamer mouse so I bound random ranks of FOL to each button.
---
Then button mash problem solved
---
if they are not then that can make enh shaman pretty good in higher pvp with something like TUF as windfury procs on that murdered anything not in plate
---
Hunters roll on upgrades like everyone else. Only difference is that they can wear 3 armor types and use almost all weapons so they have more choice and find upgrades more frequently because of that. More stats are relevant to them than most if not all classes. They dont have a single main stat that could be considered useless. Sure they arwnt actively teying to get strength, intellect or spirit but is it a dead stat if they have it on an item? No. On a warrior for example int would be a dead stat (unless they dont have their weapon skill maxed i guess), but on a hunter its not.
---
2-3 hunters max per raid. Mages 6-8. Most will roll hunter. GL with that spot  unless in shitty guild. even lock gets more spots.
---
And we wont kick anyone out. We just form group and we invite who we want. its not like we are going war against them in general chat. Nobody simply cares and we will have smooth runs.
---
And I‚Äôve been to Japan and really love Tokyo and Kyoto. 
---
But Japanese people are not living lives as nice as people in America. Not even close.
---
I clicked for a long Time then started over with keyboard there is no possible comparaison
---
Vanila nax was peak you pleb...
---
Wotlk is only good if you compare it to dumpster that happened afterwards.
---
Based on what? You think homelessness is rarity in america? You kidding me?
---
We had set prices for Armor, Weapon and Tier token pieces. Some would bid the minimum while others would spend it all. So if said person bid 650 DKP and won he would get the item and be subtracted 650. This also helped with DKP hoarding that a static system has a problem with. The only time one could hoard DKP is when they got all the gear they want and still come to raid to help the guild. This meant they would dump a large amount for items at the next tier, and why shouldn‚Äôt they? They were there to raid and help others get their gear.
---
All I am saying is that Blind Bid DKP worked perfectly for my guild. Zero drama and We progressed exceptionally well for a casually serious guild.

Do people like half the people on here even play games anymore or just watch streams instead?

There will be plenty of group for dungeon early on, be nice and add healers and tanks to your friend list, make your own group instead of waiting for a group to form

Just get permabanned for RMT and be a low-level streamer like TMSean and you'll get a beta invite guys.

Please read my comment.
---
I didn‚Äôt even mention homelessness. 
---
The quality of life in America is much higher than Japan. Not to mention the social environment. I‚Äôm not even going to dive into how Japan is a backwards country that still accepts and pushes racism pretty much country wide.
---
I think it's an awful limitation and if I could choose a classic server without it I would.
---
Level is not ever taken into calculation for anything combat wise I think. Can't be bothered to find where that was in the blue post, but you can look it up.
---
Seems like it would discourage players from picking up side-grades, which is possible if you can get items for low costs.
---
Alternatively if you're Alliance, take all of the above points and now imagine that the best defensive healer in the game wants to run around auto attacking people, totally ignoring their teammates.
---
I feel like it's really hard to play without click targeting.
---
I don't know how much things have changed, but back then people definitely assumed belf females were girls IRL and people would get VERY emotional in /2 about whether or not men should even be allowed to roll female toons.
---
FFXI was released in America at the end of 2002, basically 2003. This is where I learned to use Bio Breaks, and since the spell Bio was actually in the game and was essentially a giant blob of waste, it made sense. 
---
Not sure why it picked up in other games though, I doubt so many people quit FFXI that fast and migrated to other MMOs just to spread it. I believe someone from Everquest said they used it there, which predates FFXI, so it's most likely something related to Biological/Biohazzard, leaning towards the latter. I'm sure there's some specific reason it was used though, other than just because someone randomly thought of dumping Biohazard Waste and everyone else spread it.
---
Japan has so many social problems they literally need a train for women so they don‚Äôt get attached sexually...

Pretty sure weapon procs don‚Äôt work in Cat Form.

This will be the majority of my pvp experience

Windfury was given an internal cooldown of 3 seconds, to ensure you couldn't get WF on top of WF hits.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure weapons can‚Äôt proc in Cat Form.

There was a really cool leveling mod I had which allowed you to view wowhead comments next to the quest menu. It wasn't on curse or anything like that, I can't remember the name of it.

How does someone else enjoying something devalue your enjoyment of it? It's not like you can resell the pets for profit - they are there to be cute and enjoyed. They don't get cuter because your friend is denied having one.

---
You don't need a gaming mouse, but I've always loved the Logitech G502 and have been using it for about 3 years now. Razer shit just breaks on me.
---
If you really want to get away from clicking, hide your actionbars. You can put an image of your actionbars in their place and use an addon that alerts you when cooldowns are ready. One day of playing like that and you'll never click again.
---
Really good! I'm saving this one for future adventures:)

Not gonna lie, those are some of the lamest, least exciting, predictable and boring fights I ever watched :D
---
I know it's not the players fault. It's level 30, but goddamn, how people make such a big deal out of a mage jumping around someone else and spamming ArcExp, is beyond me.
---
However, it was a nice community driven Event, that's for sure.
---
I'm looking forward to making grinding my personal form of meditation again. I have some great memories of being "in the zone", mostly in The Hinterlands, for some reason.
---
Personally, it had a lasting side effect on me as well. I used to listen to the same five CDs of "Bar Lounge Classics" over and over again (CD changer on auto-repeat) while playing wow. This process conditioned myself to become positive and focused whenever I hear these songs again, anywhere. I can deliberately focus myself now just by putting one of these songs on. I also get random flashbacks when I'm getting drinks in a lounge bar, because these songs are everywhere people chill out. It's quite amazing what you can do to your brain.
---
Therefore, if people ask me what my most important preparation is, my answer is always "music". Spending another few hundred hours of grinding is a new opportunity to set mental anchors.
---
I love Titan Panel and loved it back then in 2004.
---
I don't think questie is a competitor? I extra didn't list questie to not start another discusson about quest helping addons haha
---
This is what I'm doing also. Best of luck!
---
Pls
---
What? Its not burka country dude. 
---
America is large country. It has many poor and rich areas. Depends where you live and what cards you were dealt.
---
I'm in the no changes group of people. But if they would do content post Naxx, I hope they make them on new servers. I just wanna enjoy true vanilla WoW.
---
totally agree. That is also what I am hoping for
---
&gt; I am sure I will score a few of them
---
Well, you get to reserve exactly 3 of them 14 days before launch.
---
Back in the day on Argent Dawn EU there was this huge yearly event at eastvale logging camp, and I remember GMs showing up as SW guards doing their patrol in full RP, it was awesome.
---
I'm having a hard time between picking my characters original names (all auto generated at the time), funny names, or names of players I idolized. There were some warlords on my server I really respected and some generally notorious people that I'd steal the name of.
---
Again, who is "we"?
---
There won't be a "we" for you. With your attitude towards others, no guild will even invite you, let along bring you to a raid.
---
Thanks . I hate it :)
---
Even with Esfand getting carried by his guild, he is doing half of prebis fury dps. i don't know why any warrior play in his guild. it feels so disrespectful to others if you play ret or any other meme spec
---
You can ask support for 24 hours freetime to ‚Äùgather‚Äù for a wow token, take that time to see if you got beta free of charge
---
&gt;Beta-boi invite
---
FTFY
---
I've fixed it! It required 17 spelling fixes + one zone update :D I've updated the links in my comment, please tell me if you find anything else!
---
Just wait for perplexity to compete:)
---
Racism this and racism that. I know many racist support trump but who cares. I wont use it as somekind excuse.
---
My point was that I rather live in healthy country than in some poor areas in america.
---
or if it were actually any good instead of just another mediocre green quest reward that's basically outdated by the time you get it.
---
Warrior, Mage and Rogue are always top 3.
---
The usual class distribution in raids (MC, BWL) are approx 8-11 warriors, 8 rogues and 4-6 mages.
---
It's not uncommon to bump the mage count up to about 8-10 for AQ and Naxx.
---
Noob question: Thunder Clap getting resisted makes sense cos of nature resist/lack of nature penetration from the warrior, but how can Charge get resisted? Do mobs have +5% chance to resist stuns?
---
GM Jokes FTW
---
His guide is great for any server population. Only way to avoid people completely is to grind from 1-60 which isn't a bad idea for a few days anyway.
---
just wait till the game comes out jeez. If you roll now your progress will just get deleted anyway. The streamers are an exception since they play to make money and thus their time investment doesn't matter.
---
peta test
---
&gt;Really? That directly contradicts their statement on being interested in creating OSRS style content.
---
Please source the statement where they're interested in creating OSRS style content.
---
Haha :d 
---
So you want a leveling guide that is made especially for Servers with a high Population? Optimally for the release of the game?
---
I leveld with Joanas a couple of times and it is great! You can skip some quests but all in all it is awesome! Just imagine the time it takes to create and perfect it :O
---
By the time you hit 60 you'll have done most quests anyway - no matter which guide. Joana just gives you key Information on how to travel efficiently and what to pick up at certain Points because you will Need it later on
---
@oj yeah not even if the server is dead. If you are leveling with a mate it is totally bullshit, because u don't have to switch the zones that often.
---
And yeah it is written on a base that the server is phase 2 or 3. So all the following quest or loot quests or even the kill one named quest are doable
---
Biggest Heist in 2k19
---
I don‚Äôt get the part about burka country? Like Japan is not Muslim?
---
Yeah, USA is huge, and obviously you can be the richest man is Sudan and live a good life or be the poorest man in Monaco and suffer. Cards dealt is everything. 
---
But if you do some research on economics and sociology of the two countries you will see Japanese people do not enjoy the same standard of life as Americans do.
---
First of all: I don't watch Esfand. 
---
Second of all: I don't understand these retail fanboys' need to incite drama between the private server players at all. Can you explain that? None of the private server guys are taking the "30 cap meta" seriously - they are mostly just chilling, goofing around and reporting bugs. If you watch one of their streams you'll notice that they are much more down to earth than most of the retail streamers. Except for Payo, but he's doing his own thing. *On top of that*, they're all recognizing the skilled arena guys as good players. 
---
Third of all: You realize that all the retail guys are NA and that most of the private server streamers are EU? There has not been that many battleground matches between retail guys and private server players. 
---
You have to realize that there are more players than just a few American streamers on horde. Some people play when those streamers are asleep. Horde *did* stop queueing at some point.
---
4th of all: I'm not lying. Sonii and Soda has actually been calling a *PUG* with 1 or 2 APES players an "APES premade" *multiple* times and they *still* do that. 
---
5th of all: It's simply not true to say that the private server guys keep losing to the arena guys. Monkeynews went almost a week without losing a single WSG match with a non-ideal group composition, meme-specs and even bringing some pugs.
---
Saving this
---
Meh. We give him a Nightfall and he can do what he want's as long as he keeps the procc up :D
---
This didn't happen until TBC. WF procs from WF procs happened in Vanilla and they happen on the Beta.
---
I really doubt they'd have a different AH per layer as it would be an unnecessary complication - what happens if you post an auction then later log onto a different layer? You either wouldn't be able to see the competition for the same object in your auction's layer or you wouldn't be able to see your auction. There would be extra work implementing solutions for these problems, so why bother?
---
A single AH would be absolutely fine - there may be three times the items being listed but there would also be three times the number of buyers. It's not a problem in the slightest, I'm playing on a \~25k pop private server with increased spawns and flasks still sell for around the same as they did in Vanilla (90-110g). Over the last month, during which the number of Horde logged in has gone from 5k to 12k, runecloth prices have spiked due to the extra demand - they used to sell for 1.5g a stack (same as in vanilla) and they're now up to 3.2g. 
---
These are not game breaking changes and will not have a detrimental affect on Classic.
---
queue the swarm of enh shamans entering BGs when they get WF
---
You think the people you insult, dismiss and kick along the way will keep that to themselves?
---
His networking behaviour seems no different to me than that of any of his Twitch and Youtube peers.
---
Am I the only one that finds transmogging lame ?
---
I am personally ok with him getting carried because of all his effort.
---
He chose Paladin and he does EVERYTHING to make it "the best it can be" (it's still not viable) 
---
What is frustrating to me is that people will play ret (cuz Esfand let them dream) but these people will not do all the effort to get buffs, consum and everything, so they will be a let down for the guild
---
When my double mace stunlock two digit midget pops out of stealth on you, you'll know what "rogues can do about it."
---
Yes, paladins can sustain in combat and heal between pulls to save on downtimes which makes them easier to play for sure. On the other hand, their kill speed is absolutely horrendous and their play style is the most boring out of the whole game so leveling to 60 can be very challenging nonetheless.
---
Avarage american or people who are doing well? Well that is your opinion then but I would rather live in japan because its safer and less room for extreme poverty.
---
Yes, they're testing it out on the closed beta. I don't think its "needed" except for in stress tests, but they're testing it out.
---
**L√©g√¥ll√°ass** incoming =)
---
Racism exists all over the world. But it would be hard finding a restaurant in America that says Japanese people aren‚Äôt allowed to enter and eat in 2019. 
---
I saw many places in Japan that foreigners couldn‚Äôt enter or even linger in front of. My female friend was kicked out of a line at a restaurant because she was blonde, while the owner yelled at her and pointed at a sign in the window that wrote ‚ÄúJapanese Only‚Äù. This happened in Tokyo. 
---
Racism is widely accepted and even encouraged in Japan. 
---
You are comparing a poor area in America vs a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù area in another country. Compare a poor area in America with a poor area in Japan. Look up slums in Osaka and you will see homelessness like you wouldn‚Äôt believe.
---
Wow what a great addition to th conversation!
---
That's not true what so ever. Sharding is every zone acting as a server and duplicates when a max population (for said shard) have reached it 's limit.
---
Exactly. Any guide to leveling with a big population would get broken by the population following the guide. Sheeple gotta herd I guess.
---
The last good ranged weapon that's a bow is the MC class quest one. So it'll be fine if you're not a raider. If you are a raider you'll pretty much get laughed out of the raid if you're still using an MC wep in AQ40 or Naxx.
---
They never said that. At least not with the innitial beta announcement (when most people resubbed).
---
&gt; does it get easier at any point?
---
If you level combat, Blade Flurry and later, Adrenaline helps. Also, having decent weapons is a top priority for leveling any physical melee damage dealer.
---
All in all, however, Rogue is rather involved (compared to other classes) when it comes to leveling. Having First Aid *really* helps reducing down time, as does cooking for buff food. Also, always have poisons on your weapons (Instant on MH, utility on OH), and remember that in Vanilla, they are not only limited in buff duration, but also by charges (which means that you may lose your poison well before its buff timer runs out).
---
Most people prefer Combat Swords (or *maybe* mace - decent fist weapons are rare) while leveling, because that way, there is no positional requirement. I *personally* prefer leveling with daggers and stunlocking the mobs as much as possible. This means that they do not wail on you quite as much, but it also means that you take a bit longer to kill mobs - you spend energy and CPs on stuns instead of damage. Still, to me, this is over-all worth it, because it also lets me get my muscle memory back into shape when it comes to energy pooling, and locking enemies down is its own reward. Lastly, be sure to kick mob casts not when they start, but when they're almost through - it's one to three seconds where you get damage in without them doing any.
---
Yes, you can.
---
In fact, [the Hunter quest weapon from MC](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=18713) is a bow as well, and that one will last you for a loooong time.
---
Here's the thing about private servers - leveling a Warrior was definitely harder on them than I recall it being in vanilla
---
I've said this before, but if leveling a rogue or warrior in vanilla was as hard as it is on private servers, my first two 60s would not have been rogue or warrior
---
Pretty sure hamstring (or earthbind) kiting is private server bs too
---
Idk. I get that the game is old, but I'm not sure if I was Blizzard if I'd want my customers vicariously experiencing all of the 1-60 leveling and dungeon content. I'd probably just opt for internal testing.
---
-Badmouthing back at them.
---
-Only dismissive towards hunters.
---
-Not native language.
---
-I dont lack basic knowledge. Give me example.
---
-Yes no because I dont want to feel like shit in dungeon. Why ruin my gaming experience.
---
-Why wouldnt they invite healer especially who can play alot. Its not like im in general spamming lfg no hunters. We make our own grp and pick people based on whispers. Nobody will badmouth anyone. We just blacklist hunters and they dont even know it.
---
found this one guess I will go with that one instead of ElvUI [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDUKKfRjfhg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDUKKfRjfhg)
---
Don't, I try to forget I threw away my wallet of "Lol, what a waste of time those bitcoins were" when I formatted the drive back in the early days.
---
I try....
---
/weep
---
Yeah, if they never get any loot.
---
I too played a troll warrior, but on a less than reputable server.
---
Always got tons of comments because it's such an uncommon combination.
---
Plus, most importantly, trolls have BiS /flex emote
---
Yes, it is true that the homeless problem in the US is more than in Japan. 
---
Average American lives better than average Japanese. 
---
Rich American lives better than rich Japanese. 
---
Poor American lives better than poor Japanese. 
---
I can‚Äôt argue that Japan is MUCH safer. Nobody can argue that. 
---
As to where you would rather live that is your opinion. Economically you are making a pier decision to live in Japan over USA. But up to you!
---
In pve point of view it's true. However the blue pvp set (all hail to the mighty setbonus if my memories are correct) and the reputation rewards from battlegrounds are kinda nice for pvp.
---
Yes, it's true that you can't kill equilly geared pvp players in ONE form, but you are an RP god class! The class fantasy is about to change forms, thats what makes it exciting. And yes, it should require some form management to play it to the fullest.
---
&gt;  I‚Äôm sure subs tripled for last month.

For thoses who are telling you that "*it's impossible to have a correct threat without KTM*" just take a look at MC/BWL world first. **They did it without it when the threat was harder than in 1.12.**
---
\- KTM will clearly make raid easier since you won't have to take care of your dps/threat the whole fight, you'll just need to take a look at a tool displaying an information not available natively, then slow a bit we needed.
---
\- DBM will allow you to focus on your 2-3 spells rotation without having to be on alert **the whole fight**. You'll just have to wait him to tell you what to do and when.
---
Not 100% true. Im sure blizzard had plenty of stupid ideas on their own. I certainly dont recall anyone asking for a titanforge like system.
---
lvling a rogue is not that hard actually. Compared to for example Warriors, you don't need to hit to gain energy for abilities. You have a lot more utility in combat and can CC a mob from stealth up to a minute. You have evasion if things turn bad and you deal quite a lot of damage.
---
" **Japan** has offered full **healthcare** coverage to its population for almost 60 years. Compared with the **US** system, **Japan**'s **healthcare** system costs half as much and produces better medical outcomes. "
---
Japanese live longest in world. They have avarage highest age. Americans lifespan is #43th in world.
---
Lets try again..
---
Bet Blizzard made millions just from people trying to get into the beta.
---
I had a blast and a ton of fun. I don‚Äôt consider having fun a waste of time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
At this point I just want in to set up my ui etc.
---
That's confirmed to be a bug.
---
&gt;5-man dungeons in vanilla can take hours though
---
And you shouldn't start one unless you have hours of free time. I know it sucks and inconveniences you, that is how these old games work, but that doesn't give you the right to inconvenience everyone else just because they HAVE to wait. It's really not an option. Most people don't want to come in mid-run and it takes forever to replace someone because they have to run out. People know this and take advantage of it. Just because our only other option is waiting an hour+ and restarting the dungeon doesn't mean it's okay for you to waste 15, 30 or 45 mins of our time.
---
If your grandma or baby falls down some stairs and starts crying, sure, go deal with your emergency, that is a totally legit excuse for holding people up. You need a 5-10 minute bathroom break because you have been chugging redbulls and burritos for the last 10 hours? Sure, most of us probably have and could use the break too. You want to go eat dinner for 30 minutes with your family when you knew it was probably going to overlap like this? Honestly, fuck you. I'll wait for you, not because I respect you, not because I don't want to choke you, but because I just don't have another reasonable choice, and that doesn't make me an asshole for feeling that way, it makes you an asshole for putting us in this situation. 
---
None of this is directed at you personally. This isn't an attack. it's directed at the general usage of "you", everybody who DOES this stuff. I love these oldschool game mentalities and mechanics, but waiting for people to eat has ALWAYS been rude in all of them, and everyone hated it. Not sure why anyone here is looking back at it with positive nostalgia and acting like it's okay, it really isn't. I'll mostly be playing with friends, so luckily I won't have to deal with this shit very often, but if I ever pick up a random that does, they are getting blacklisted and never invited again after the run ends. Whether people on this sub admit it or not, they will largely do the same unless they are the ones acting like that.
---
I got my pseudo before i even know warcraft existed even on reddit i had to put "xd" at the end of it because of how simple it is. On retail i usually put a "√∏" or "oh" at the end
---
Let's be fair. Regardless of crimes he supported classic before it was the "hot new thing". People keep saying this game is amazing yet are so sceptical about people actually liking it.
---
nic e bob
---
People in the comment seems to not understand what OP is asking.
---
Blood fury give you a debuff that reduce heal by 50%.
---
I think that it doesn't stack and that the highest one take priority but that would need testing once beta is up to lvl 40.
---
BF give a debuff of 50% and MS 50% too. I don't remember my heal being completely nullified ever so maybe it's multiplicative and give a 75% debuff once both are appliqued?
---
Now the games in the backpack are worth 20x what the collectors edition of wow is worth
---
but i checked also will not be mounted to classic. What a shame :( :)
---
Sapping, mainly chain-sapping, is FAR more frustrating than actually being killed. Loss of character control is one of the most infuriating things in any game, so to be locked into it for a very long time by another player is absolutely rage-inducing.
---
Go combat, pick up the talents for less energy cost for Sinister strike and then Parry &gt; Riposte &gt;+Hit &gt; Dual wield dmg in that order. Use swords or maces rather than daggers.
---
Make sure you always have an up to date weapon, it's worth doing dungeons for good blue weapons. Even checking AH if your weapon is a few lvls lower than you is worth it.
---
Oh boy, that brings back memories. Trying to keep the drums rumbling throughout the fight (TBC though, played a healer in classic).
---
Absolutely. I used to like grinding in TBC for primals. I haven't had a meaningful grind in game for a long time.
---
Jonas guide is excellent.
---
R/Classicwow: DoN‚Äôt ChAnGe AnYtHiNg!!!!1111
---
Also r/Classicwow: Here‚Äôs a list of 20 mandatory addons for launch.
---
https://redd.it/bw3i69
---
&gt; For example; There was a decurse addon that decursed anyone in the raid that had a curse, without you targeting them.
---
I remember that this functionality was removed by Blizzard at some point though. The addon just showed who was cursed, prompting you to target them and manually decurse them.
---
I know the pain bro, I was a clicker from vanilla to WOTLK and was playing mage so you can imagine how bad I was. After watching some mage PVP vids and the amount of spells etc required I knew I couldn't click any longer. I bought a Razer Naga and Razer Nostromo, keybinded everything up and I've never looked back since. The first few days are awkward I won't lie but believe me you start remembering which keys are for what without even thinking. Just make sure you keybind A &amp; D to strafe left/right so you can rotate around targets turning the camera with the mouse.
---
I believe there are free, unsellable books you can buy from a vendor somewhere, can't remember the zone. It would be ideal to use those since they can't even quickly sell them at a vendor like the hammers. Way more effort for minimal extra payout, but bigger payout nonetheless.
---
I think what blizzard should of said was that EU members would have an even slimmer chance of beta than US, that would of made it more understandable.
---
Why? Mage still gonna loose vs Warlock. If you watch bin playing, He get wrecked by random warlocks who not even Using fear so.
---
I take it, what basically happens is that you sync the mob attack and your attack? But the mob attack speed is 2.0, which mean they hit for a lot lower than your 3.6 2Her.
---
Just requires quite the twitchy playstyle to get rewarded with a lot less downtime (eating/healing) I guess.
---
Really like the idea of a rotating counsel, and the democratic nature of the system. Only one thing I dislike. Some people only raid because they want to get items for PVP, which aren't necessarily items they can use in PVE.  
---
That seems like a 'valid' reason to raid, but whether you were allowed to do it would depend on whether the elected LC agreed with you. With a more static LC, the guild's PVP-friendly attitude wouldn't be so... transitory. Thoughts?
---
It's pretty small but I think Ahn'Qiraj is still misspelled. If the source file is high resolution, you might want to look for an image host other than imgur -- they downscale high-resolution stuff.
---
beta could use like 2500 more EU players, impossible to find a dungeon group at EU times if you don't PAY REAL MONEY to join a guild.
---
Just pst people. Don't waste your time spamming trade. Just be direct and narrow your search in /who to find what you want. Tons of people will jump at the chance to do a dungeon, they're just not sitting in trade, they're out playing the game.
---
Nah, they'll be waiting for the AQ or Naxx bows to drop.
---
Hu-mons tend to be biased creatures, even the ones who think they aren't.
---
Play on EU servers if you ar so concerned
---
Don‚Äôt worry, it can‚Äôt convolute the story since the only plot relevant races are orcs, humans and undead.
---
You think quality of life is only related to healthcare or life span?
---
Japanese people are literally projected to be extinct in the not so distant future due to their shock rate, aging population, and unwillingness of people to procreate as their sociological problems have left them inept. This is a researched projection. 
---
Here is a big indicator of a countries quality of life: Happiness Index. 
---
JAPAN IS NOT EVEN IN THE TOP 50 IN THE WORLD. Countries with dictator literally rank better than that 
---
America has a health care issue. This needs to be fixed, keep in mind the vast population and area difference between Japan and America. 
---
Anecdotally, many people in Japan were pissing their pants when they found out I was American, they dream of moving here. 
---
Nobody is making an argument that Japan is all around better than the United Stars, not even the Japanese. Why are you? It‚Äôs not a correct argument. 
---
Now to be a douche: ‚ÄúLets try again...‚Äù
---
&gt;Tukui is ported to Classic client so I'll just use that.
---
\+  ElvUI / ShestakUI are full UI suites being worked on . Just got that out of a discord.
---
Remember Eurojackpot on friday dude!
---
I chose Scarlet monestary because I enjoyed that instance so much, it was challenging while having an interesting mix of content. It was also not too long and didn't require many hours to complete like BRD or Dire Maul. A close second for me would have also been Zul'farak because I have fond memories of trying to farm it for the sword.
---
Completely different playstyle and class fantasy. Shaman does work, it's just not the best for that like other pure classes. Add in the utility it can provide and they may be better off with it unlike one more 'omgtopdps' class. Someone needs to pick up the mail spell dmg stuff, isn't it?
---
zul farrak!!!
---
It depends city but you are correct. It has inbred history. Majority especially millenials do not share those values though.
---
As for rest:
---
lifespan: Japan #1, USA #43
---
fire releated death: Usa 120.5 Japan 0.6 per habitant.
---
Earning less than 5.5 dollar per day:
---
Usa 4.7% Japan 1.7%
---
That's really weird, because the map I've downloaded here 
---
&gt; https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1170&amp;p=6575
---
also has "Ahn Quiraj" as a name instead of Ahn'qiraj. Are they not directly from ingame?
---
Check out my other response.
---
You'll get puf for MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20 but it's still better with a guild even a casual guild.
---
AQ40 pug are generally a mess.
---
It takes way less than that
---
I feel like a lot of people are coming from private servers and pretending that's the way it was in vanilla. I can honestly say I didn't see pug raids becoming a thing until guilds had content on farm in TBC.
---
How many times did you run it to get the sword?
---
If it came out before classic to build hype instead of this stupid lvl 30 meta then yeah would of been great, but now its comming out after classic then whats the point? everyone will be playing classic lol...
---
I really like Sunken Temple, just because you fight dragons in there as a mid-range character. Felt bad ass taking down dragons to me as a newbie. I also remember dying a lot simply to get *inside* the Temple. It was a wonderful shit show with too many layers and endless confusion. Same for whatever that Ogre instance in Feralas was, it felt massive and sprawling. Honestly, I'm excited to do all the old dungeons.
---
it was all about Sephiroth as well
---
That bow is bis for warrior and rogue.
---
STV Big Game hunter gun is better for hunter cuz more damage
---
I resubbed and have been doing ironman it's really fun. Closest thing to Classic I can get to lol
---
I plan on going engi at lvl 60. since mining is absolute hell without a mount I prefer to level some profession that will give me some cash in the levelling process
---
Deadmines: because of ripsnarl and captain cookie.üêä
---
&gt; Im sorry you don‚Äôt understand what an analogy is
---
I know what an analogy is, yours was just bad and hyperbolic. Vanilla is easy as fuck, if you have to min/max to down the raids you're not very good.
---
It's pretty true, devs actually tried to get the game back to a good spot and players had a fit. Things like easy heroics, dungeon finder, and trivializing leveling really drove away players. They were all things pushed for by the playerbase that actually hurt the game. When the devs added tough content back in Cata, players had a fit till it was nerfed into the ground.
---
No one wants "doable". If you do, that is fine, but most people don't. Even casuals want to be efficient as they usually have less time to waste. That's just how it is. No one hates Pally though, they just aren't inviting tanks or ret, even to dungeons, if they can help it.
---
Those do not really count since once you can get your hands on them all the progression is pretty much done and for 95% of the game orcs will use axes.
---
Daily quests are the worst offender to me when it comes to TBC. I like grinding but i dont want to be forced to it. In classic you could do what you wanted whenever you wanted. While in TBC you came on knowing that your first hour or two would be doing the same quests as yesterday and tomorrow. Every single day. Its shit. In classic i have just as much to do but i can do it whenever i want or i can skip a day of doing X to do Y and maybe the next day i do more of X and less of Y.
---
Addons in raid aren't knowledge at all but they allow us to be more efficient.
---
We don't need to learn mechanics anymore and just follow what they are telling us to do.
---
I also remember the adventure to get to it. The first time I went into sunken Temple I remember being amazed that there was something hidden in there and not just interesting scenery like other MMOs I had been playing at the time
---
anyone understand the differences between  
---
ElvUI , ShestakUI  and TukUI?
---
Details - damage/healing meter, it is way better than both recount and skada.
---
Weakauras - despite the fact that most weakauras wont work in classic this is still a must have for me.
---
Arkinventory - (if they ever fix it to work for classic), again it is far better than addons like bagnon.
---
Omni CC - cant live without it
---
Elvui - if they make it work with classic, otherwise I might use Tukui if they fix some of the issues I have with it.
---
NugRunning - for dot tracking, this one might change because it was the only one I could find that does a good job but its not perfect.
---
thanks for the input ill take note.
---
enhance would be cool but since my brother will roll warrior and we don't want to need on the same gear I will lvl elemental. I get the intellect leather and 1h weapons, and he gets the mail/plate and the big sexy 2 handers
---
Details work on beta, just get the alpha version https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/details/files
---
It's what this sub does best.
---
Kronos does not have 30 min paladin buffs?
---
Dont get me wrong i like the classes in modern wow. I enjoy the specs i used to play. When makes it not fun is that everyone can do the same thing.
---
Going for duo names like Pip &amp; Squeak for gnome rogues. Maybe Link &amp; Zelda for a Warrior Hunter duo. Could be childish and see if we could snag Six &amp; Nine. I have a whole list cause the bf and I are gonna be *that* matching couple if we can snag what names we want. If not those, I can always fall back on my old WoW names that are unique.
---
Do the invites come in waves, that I may have missed?
---
Or if I sub now, is there a day-by-day chance?
---
Not as good as some of the others in this thread, but I've got a couple.
---
* After getting the Ritual of Doomguard spell as warlock, go to Goldshire and ask some people to help with a class quest (helps if you have a buddy to convince people its legit). Invite them to your party and, once full, plop down the summon stone. One random party member (including the warlock) is automatically sacrificed. Even if you survive, don't enslave it. Just watch it wreak havoc on panicking lowbies.
---
* Used to play with my step-bro with both our computers in the same room. He was a NE, I was human. We'd walk around Darnassus or Moonglade and converse with him speaking Darnassian and me speaking Common. He'd just tell me what he was saying as he typed it. Every now and then people'd ask me how I understood and I'd explain that at 60 you can get trained in other languages.
---
seems my memory played a trick on me after checking a speedleveling guide.
---
3-6h are probably the right values, my apologies
---
Same, I didn't get invited, and I don't care about it.
---
My experience on less official servers are the opposite. Granted i dont play alliance but alliance is always ganking people and killing NPCs. It was especially bad in stonetalon mountain because the NPCs there are only like level 37. The whole village was dead constantly.
---
The parry penalty is based on mob level difference (+3 or 63) not weapon skill/defense skill difference. You still get the parry penalty from hitting boss level mobs with 305 weapon skill.

---
You blame minmaxers, but the truth is casuals don't wanna deal with that shit either. You can take a ret pally through dungeons, but why would you? It means you are going to take longer to kill stuff, period. Casual players especially don't want to increase their risk when they have limited time to play. They want to get stuff done as fast and as smooth as possible so they don't waste their entire playtime, and a ret pally just isn't worth the risk.
---
Buy a lot of blacksmith hammers. They are not stackable and super cheap.
---
Create a level 1 alt. Mail them to the alt.
---
Send them, 1 per mail, to your friend/guildie. 100s of them. 
---
Delete alt (this way he cant just click return button).
---
For bonus points find a cheap unique item (there's an apple that is sold in Shattrath in tbc thats cheap and unique, and can be mailed, but i dont know about vanilla) which would make the other person have to manually open every mail and delete the item.
---
Ah yes, the pre nerf boobs.
---
I would love to know the books if you manage to remember!
---
as I said in the post. It's a topic which is discussable.
---
But I used all these addons during vanilla 2004-2006 already :) most of them are not new.
---
Fucking unemployed bored hordy killing low level...
---
I only mentioned Japan because of this  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_firearm-related\_death\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate) 
---
It was releated to fact that americans have egoistic opinions and it is hard to change them on their ways. 
---
As for Japan population they are #11th in world per habitant. I think they have enough people to worry about it. And why you care about elder when they have superior healthcare and live longest. For America #43th spot is pitiful.
---
I think they are. Maybe that's just what it says in the 1.12 client... perhaps Blizzard isn't immune to typos either, or whoever extracted the maps did so from a non-enUS client. In the 2.4.3 maps it says Ahn'Qiraj, and I can vouch for those being straight from the client because I extracted them myself.
---
found a own subreddit for UIs by the way.. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowui/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowui/)
---
In vanilla you had addons that automated the game to the extent that all you had to do was move and scroll the mouse wheel through the whole raid.
---
my real vanilla experience after the beta was with addons. Latest when you hit 60 you had them :) nothing new in my opinion.
---
It's what I did with Blizzard VT, for Classic WoW Demo. That was a 100% sure thing, and I did it to show my support for Classic.
---
With beta...well, I just couldn't. Simply because the chances to get into Beta are lower than winning the Lottery.
---
AND it would not clearly showed my support for Classic...but for BfA.
---
SOLID reasons, for me, not to resub to BfA, just to increase my chances for Beta access from 0% to 0.0000001%.
---
I've always called them dungeons ^^
---
Deadmines , SFK , BFD , RFK/RFD , Maraudon , Uldaman , BRD , Scholo , Stralhome , Wailing Cavern , Zul Farrak , Scarlet Monastery , Sunken Temple , Zul Gurub , UBRS , LBRS
---
not interested = Gnomergann
---
As long as its intended to lock people to a single layer, as it seems people are bouncing around layers for no reason.
---
Perhaps adding a cooldown to switching layers  + requiring you to be out of combat would help.
---
Elemental shamans are fine in early gear levels since they get so much good stuff from talents (11% crit,3% hit). They also have all the utility they bring with totems and off heals.
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world...of warcraft.
---
The very-toxic elements of private server communities will hopefully get clipped out by getting reported when they decide to spam their nonsense in global chat channels. Otherwise the best thing to do imo is to lead by example. Avoid flaming people for mistakes, ninjaing loot, etc. In time your actions will reflect upon the community at large, and you'll probably find yourself with players of a similar disposition to your own.
---
sunken temple = skinner's heaven
---
Well, "bold" is actually understating. It is a crazy assumption.
---
Not true. Theres some quests that arent hurt as much by high population than others (eg. deliveries vs waiting for an item spawn). A high population guide would simply focus on the former
---
A friend of mine got WoW like 1 year after the rest of us. And he loved the shit out of ZF. He never quit talking about it. Every day for weeks, he lvled like 40-52 just in ZF.
---
And we were like "man dude, we know it's good. We did it a year ago!" but he just kept talking about it.
---
ZF is some good shit though.

 **\[PVP / RP / RP-PVP - US anytime zone / Alliance preferred, but will roll Horde for the right guild\]** Currently looking for an Alliance guild (casual or semi-hardcore) that aims at having a member cap (quality over quantity approach). Before I go further I just want to clarify that big guilds are completely fine; However, I personally much prefer the tight-knit atmosphere of a 50-60 man capped guild where everyone knows one another. I've been a part of both and there was always something that I enjoyed about raiding with the same people every week and growing as a team element instead of witnessing clicks and the like. I understand that a guild like this is not the norm and will probably be difficult to find, which is why I am casting out my line in the hopes that it reaches a guild with a similar mindset.
---
**About me:** I'm in my 30's and I currently work from home so raid attendance should pose little to no issue. At first I mained 2h fury but eventually moved into resto druid which is what I plan to main this time around with alchemy/herbalism as my professions. As for raids my experience stretches from MC to the first half of Ahn'Qiraj. In regards to pvp I maintained the rank of Lieutenant General during my time in vanilla. I've been in leadership roles before, but I much prefer following directions rather than giving them out. I always try my best to excel and come prepared with consumables and ready ahead of time. I know when to be in a relaxed and chill mind frame vs being serious for raids. My plan is to play an excorbinant amount of hours that I can to obtain BiS pre-raid asap, consumables and the like while helping out others along the way.
---
Thank you for taking the time to read my post. Please feel free to message me if you would like more information or fit the criteria.

So you pretty much ignored everything I said?
---
Went back to the whole ‚Äúyou guys have guns‚Äù 
---
Here‚Äôs a newsflash, our civilian population can probably take over all over Japan and their military. 
---
So that makes us: the smartest, the strongest, the most culturally and economically dominant country ever to exist. 
---
But wait, we have bad healthcare and university payment structure. Those will be fixed soon enough, and the rest of the world will still beg to move here. 
---
Your facts are meaningless and you have failed this argument. 
---
You still haven‚Äôt said what country you are from. Are you Japanese?
---
Isn't this when you're supposed to go grind boars in the forest?

If you have any sort of real job you will not be able to reach r14
---
Molten Core bosses are almost all tank-and-spank. Most have a single mechanic for players to think about, or perhaps two. Magmadar puts fire on the ground and does an AOE fear. Garr comes with 8 adds, but otherwise just stands there and hits the tank. If you can move out of rain of fire, then you can kill Gehennas.
---
I think it is the patch or? I went into MC before 1.12 and it took us in the beginning 3 raid days a week t clear it. The first months we even didn't clear it at all and stopped after a certain boss.
---
But it is all related to the patch and balances or? The addons were a nice little helper, but not that important. 
---
I wish we would get this time back where we really need some time to clear MC. That was real progression.
---
Ditto. August 26th will be my resub day.

"Buy many, many copies of Peeling the Onion (or alliance equivalent) from the AV vendor and mail them to people until their mailbox is full. These items are free, and cannot be vendored once purchased. Hopefully the other person has a mail addon ;)"

Haha, ditto.
---
I don't mind either way about getting into the beta, but every time I get an email from Blizzard my heart stops.
---
&lt;3
---
For the sake of your safety you should delete this.
---
Scarlet Monastery is the only dungeon I actually clearly remember. I played vanilla, BC, and Wrath, but for after 7-8 years I've forgotten the layout, bosses, and drops to most dungeons.
---
I get that "oh I remember now" feeling if I watch a video or look up an old dungeon, but I dont need to do that for SM. I already remember. 
---
It's such a good dungeon. I ran it so many times. I played Horde back then, so getting to it was much easier than now.
---
i wish i could have picked more than one, for me its mostly scholomance but strtholme and SM are closely following it for my favourite dungeons
---
If you have a way to get from 1-60 without kill quests or named quest mobs I'll be all over that. Please link.
---
but isn't the main problem the 1.12 patch? I would love to have Molten Core hard as f\*\*\*, but I gave up when I read we start with 1.12? 
---
Addons are nice I agree, but the DBM of 2004 was just a Teamspeak with a good raid leader. Worked also well :)
---
Name reservation?
---
I've got to check this out, if it's true, fuck Blizzard for getting a resub from me earlier than I wanted to.
---
Just looked up an Ahn'Qiraj gate opening video, and it's spelled correctly in the video when he opens the map. https://i.imgur.com/QNox0LZ.jpg
---
Not offensive but definitely worthy of a downvote.
---
I resubbed and got in a Week later. Worked out fine.
---
Well that sucks.. but I appreciate your candor. I honestly don't like it but I don't know how else to get my name out there
---
I just made a rogue out of curiosity &amp; I will say, Rogue 1-10 is far tougher than Warrior 1-10, imo. You can‚Äôt dual wield, and you‚Äôre way squishier. You also don‚Äôt have a lot of good abilities yet. Luckily 1-10 doesn‚Äôt take long. I imagine rogue passes Warrior shortly after. 
---
As for Warriors, once you get to 40 &amp; get a mount, plate armor, mortal strike, etc. it‚Äôs not so bad from my experience.
---
Deadmines
---
Get him!!
---
 I consider myself a pretty good player 
---
 but I've always clicked...
---
?????????
---
Your lucky they are releasing it at all.
---
I also resubbed for chance of beta. I got only invited to stress test.
---
But when I get server first, everyone is going to look at me on my majestic Frostsaber and think "Wow. There goes a total badass." :)
---
^^^^^^^theregoesatotalfuckingautist
---
Me too. I have noticed a switch recently. A lot of new players the closer classic gets to launch, and more bad attitudes. Most PS players I‚Äôve played with have been very friendly in general though.
---
Well ofc you can take smaller countries. You spent fortune on Iraq and lost countless lives for nothing. Though I have to say I really respect your president Trump who doesnt invade Korea or Syria like that fucked up Hillary.
---
Im from scandinavia. Our system here is best. If we got rid of fucking cancer EU it would be cherry on cake.
---
The flipside of that coin being you're directly competing for loot with 7 other people.
---
Play games and tell people you‚Äôre streaming Incase they want to watch after you‚Äôre done playing together. Find a discord community where you could share your channel with
---
any class can have a bad/inexperienced player behind the keyboard.
---
I think most people would prefer to not group with you.
---
Looking at data from Beta client  ([https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5)) and the wording in Blizzard's previous blue post, the Parry chance comes from level difference and not at all from Weapon skill difference.
---
You better engage him before he engages you, just sayin
---
The dungeons are there but the level cap is 30. They can‚Äôt test lasher farming
---
"A group who is focused around fun"
---
 Tries to make a SS wow guild focusing only on ganking people..
---
Strat dead side  (I think) back in vanilla I remember of the hardest things my guild had to get on farm was the strat 45 runs for tier 0.5 (again, I think) ,the amount of times we took to get that under control and once we had it on farm was a phenomenal feeling
---
In what way are priests worse? lol
---
Well you said your basically 2 months from streaming classic so it feels a bit premature to gain viewers from the classic reddit. If you want some unsolicited advice here are some ideas.
---
1. Don't ask for views, make something people want to see. If you make some clips of your stream and post that then people might like what you do and watch you.
---
2. Make yourself part of a community then plug yourself. If people get to know you then you plug yourself they will be more willing to watch. There are probably thousands of wanna be streamers and you have to set yourself a part from them.
---
Right, but its understandable that people who are used to one thing dont want it to be changed. Blizzard made dungeons easier in the first place, it was their idea, if they didnt do that in the first place things would probably still be different. Or like how every class has an interrupt now, if all of a sudden they'd take away my interrupt i would be pissed, but i never asked for it and if they didnt give it to me in the first place i would totally be fine with it. Taking things away from players will always cause that, cant take away what they never had tho.
---
They are safer but slower.
---
305 Weapon Skill seems to need 6% hit to never miss. See ( [https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5) ) for beta client test values.
---
That is secondary. The primary reason is to see Classic popularity potential, because layering or not, they have to be ready for the tsunami of millions of players flocking their servers.
---
In other words, they need to know how many servers to fire up on launch day.
---
And this name reserver is HUGE, because your name in Classic matters, and I won't be amazed if over 90% of the Classic players will resub on August 13th.
---
Yeah, easy money, but also preparing a proper (as much as possible) Classic WoW launch.
---
You don't really "see" those after a while, though.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt want to have to settle for an xbow at endgame.
---
Unfortunately, if you want to improve your damage by a significant amount, you'll have to. And there's one reason: Weapon Speed
---
This is your 9 second rotation in raids (besides Tranq Shot when needed): 
---
    Auto Shot + Aimed Shot (cast) &gt; Aimed Shot (fire) + Auto Shot + Multi-Shot &gt; Auto Shot
---
Your aimed shot is a 3 second cast and does Weapon Damage + Bonus. This means that any weapon with a Weapon Speed longer than 3 seconds is actually benefiting from Aimed Shot's 3 second cast. Multi-Shot is the same way, except it's instant, so all Weapon Speeds benefit, just slower weapons benefit *more*.
---
Also, you can't fire Auto Shot while casting Aimed Shot, so anything faster than 3 seconds gets clipped. The perfect hunter weapon has a 3.45 second Weapon Speed (because of bonus from Quiver bringing it to 3 seconds).
---
Bows are all fast. Rhok'delar (MC) is 2.9, Huhuran's Stinger (AQ) is 2.7, Soulstring (Naxx) is 2.9.
---
Crossbows are all slow. Ashjre'thul (BWL) is 3.4, Nerubian Slavemaker (Naxx) is 3.2.
---
Because of its slow speed, Ashjre'thul is the best Hunter weapon in the game until Naxx.
---
Not counting stats (because they'll be the same no matter what):
---
Rhok'delar is the only BIS bow (because there are no crossbows until you get to BWL). It hits for 127.5 average damage. In 9 seconds, it fires 5 times. That's 70.83 base DPS.
---
Soulstring is the best Bow in the game, it hits for 147.5 average damage. And in 9 seconds, it fires 5 times. That's 81.94 base DPS.
---
Ashjre'thul hits for 155 average damage. It fires the same amount of times in those 9 seconds, so that's 86.1 base DPS.
---
Nerubian Slavemaker hits for 183 average damage. Again, it fires the same amount of times in those 9 seconds, so that's 101.6 base DPS.
---
Good stuff. I appreciate the advice. I've been talking to my friends and they have said something similar to this
---
Great idea! I will add a question ASAP for servers.
---
I loged on to the battlenet app and I can play battle for azeroth without resubbing and without even buying this damned expansion(but no classic unfortunately)!  Anyone else experienced such a wierd behaviour ?
---
What about character creation day on the 13?
---
We can take on any country. Without a doubt. Even the biggest countries have 0 chance. 
---
You‚Äôre Scandinavian and you aren‚Äôt familiar with the happiness index of countries? You guys pretty much top it every year. 
---
I‚Äôve been to Denmark, Norway, and Iceland (if you consider it Scandinavian, Nordic nevertheless). I‚Äôm very impressed with the systems in place in those countries. Probably the best in the world and people are always happy, educated; and polite. Just not very social  
---
Scandinavians as a whole don‚Äôt like the EU?
---
Also, look into how much help the United States has given to the Scandinavian countries since the 1900s. It‚Äôs a lot!
---
It's summer from May to November where I am.
---
This is a local shop for local people, there's nothing for you here!
---
Razer Naga Trinity and Corsair Scimitar are the two big ones. 
---
Logitech has an MMO mouse that is a lot cheaper and just as good imo. That would be my vote if you dont want to spend 60-80 bucks on a mouse. Logitech's is like 30 something.
---
Taking part and actively encouraging world pvp which is currently a massively lacking area of current retail and a massive part of vanilla wow encouraging faction teamwork and rivalry ? I would say that sounds good and fun ? That is the whole point of being a part of a different faction on a pvp server haha if you don‚Äôt wanna be killed by the other faction don‚Äôt play on the pvp server ... I also said we would gain players who are killing our faction players.
---
Kill quests arent as much of a problem. You just form a party with 4 people around you. The real problem is when you have to collect a chest or whatever that spawns every 5 10 minutes and only one person can take it.
---
Partially because of joana's guide you have huge queues at those quests and they are the worst part of leveling on high population. And because it's in the guide people dont skip it.
---
Lol holy shit you need professional help
---
He did get hired by blizzard.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/534bsz/blizzard\_just\_asked\_me\_to\_make\_videos\_for\_them/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/534bsz/blizzard_just_asked_me_to_make_videos_for_them/)
---
I did it.  Lost $15 lol.
---
You may now consider that you are in fact not a good player.
---
!!!!!!!!!!
---
Why would anybody care, what you are about to do in ..... RETAIL.....
---
Pfft. I submitted an unrelated ticket during the bfa launch and they just told me they didn't have time to resolve it.
---
Youre right. Both of them work well with hunter. But are you talking about BGs or Open Pvp?
---
&gt;Nobody anywhere considers September summer except when being technical.
---
FL checking in. September is still very much summery.
---
Even grind will be hard in the beginning, because everything will be over populated.
---
is titan panel the one that counts kills on mobs for you?
---
Please speak for yourself. And good luck finding a tank for dungeons with this attitude.
---
Sincerly
---
A Tankadin, who will do dungeons, not raids
---
im sure there is just as much toxicity in live wow as there is in pservers.
---
Thank you so much :)
---
I truly appreciate the kindness you displayed by testing this :)
---
If you have to post questions about rank 14 , you're not going to get it :(
---
PVP is one thing my man, 40 rogues and druids tearing everything they see apart, that's not PVP. That's SSVP. But good luck anywayüíÄ
---
Trying to become a steamer huh? Have you tried plugging yourself in?
---
Almost anyone. High dps is best as the pet does the tanking so the biggest speed up comes from finishing things off faster.
---
Something that can heal. Druid probably a wise choice.
---
This man knows...
---
Lok'tar Ogar
---
Esfand is a good secondary imo. I like him when he is on other people's streams or hes talking to other people in discord. I dont really like his actual stream very much.
---
Different folks different strokes.  Hes not a bad guy, I have nothing negative to say about him or his stream.
---
Ahh the good old warrior, absolute nightmare to level, absolute beast at end game.
---
I quit the game 3 times trying to level my first 60 warrior, since my first character was a hunter, which had the opposite problem, Wonderful to level, useless at end game.
---
But I still played that warrior right up until BC came out. Loved him.
---
Looks like the Alliance were wayy outnumbered there.
---
:) Thanks and good luck not taking part in what is a HUGE part of vanilla and imo one of the most fun aspects of vanilla :P
---
As people have said, they will always be in demand for both dps and tanking. But yes, half the people that plan to play them will absolutely not make it to 60 for *'insert reason here'*. This is factoring in huge casual population on live, obviously private servers have a fuck ton of warriors at max because only fairly hardcore and/or serious players are playing on them for the most part.
---
Have you not read the post about Classic on the main WoW site?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get why people are clamoring to get into beta when private servers are a thing.
---
Ashjre'thul from BWL my dude
---
I'll PVP. Just not join a hitsquad of people ganking everything like a ghostship. Heil me I guess.
---
So much \*\*\*\* and still too embarrassed to tell where you are from.  
---
But talking about other countries like you live in all of them.
---
Blood for the blood god!
---
Arise my champion!
---
That being said, Pre-BIS weapons are all crossbows and in an ideal world, you'd rather put 19 (20) points into BM if you have a choice. Troll Racial becomes really good once they get Rhok'Delar, though.
---
Nah they like EU because they keep voting those leftist idiots. Though right is on the rise.
---
These are our rape statistics per population.
---
Irak: 40x
---
Turkey: 30x
---
Somalia: 23x 
---
This means that if population were equal out of 1 native there would be 90 muslim rapers.
---
Also 90% of them are jobless and sitting on generous benefits. Socialism is great but if it is naive it will get destroyed. EU brings us these fucking ratheads.
---
I looked through his post history and comment history, I can't find anything saying things fell through? was it on face book or something?
---
"Stop promoting and generating hype for your upcomming release by using popular streamers and social media influencers reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
---
Noone is as good, that's the point.
---
Thanks for this in-depth response, does make it a lot easier to understand why xbows are meta for raiding. What's this like for pvp? I assume there are too many variables  for the same meta to hold, no?
---
My voidy was Zang‚Äôthak. Always thought that was a cool name. Can‚Äôt remember my other demons, clearly he was the best!
---
The lack of unarmoured epic mounts is making me depressed.
---
Deadmines and Scarlet Strath, as well as UBRS. Loved those instances.
---
Real orcs would never wear robes. Roll undead and rock out in your dress.
---
&gt;wen't
---
Oh you're a special.
---
I was planning my whole leveling strategy around them. Seems like an odd choice to take content out of the game and remove player choice.
---
Well then that‚Äôs fine ... you do you but vanilla isn‚Äôt about having a huge epeen it‚Äôs just do your own thing have your own fun in your own way but for me I think it would be cool helping out a guild trying to get to their raid but a horse guild prevents them and we heed the call and suddenly as you said a ‚Äúgank squad‚Äù comes outta nowhere stealthy and shit and fucks the entire horde guild up ;) sounds like great fun and will encourage us to talk and participate with others guilds and players of our faction
---
Classic poetry ca. 2005
---
Pretty chill dude, my only complain is how hard he sells the whole "ret pally is viable" idea.
---
I've said this in an other post earlier. Esfand is like a super tryhard to make Ret the best it can be. 
---
He does everything that is possible from Gear, Buff and Consumables and he still does a lot less dmg than other specs. (We talk about 1/3 DPS) The only reason he finds a "good" guild is that he still brings the pally utility and he is a freakin tryhard doin his best! 
---
That's the reason he says Ret is viable, **if** a ret pally is amazing at the game and works 50hr/week to make it viable, he will do the same dps as a shit warri.   
---
**BUT** if someone is not willing to commit that much time to the whole Ret idea, it will be hard awakening for them. That's what I'm scared off. 
---
***Bonus Point***: *If the Warrior is not shit.... bye bye*
---
If world pvp then druid for healing, mobility and stealth. For bgs it doesnt really matter as there'd be 8+ others
---
1.12 is an issue too for early content. Probably why players can't believe how easy are dungeons and leveling in Classic = because of the buff of classes/gear in 1.12 and probably nerf of the content
---
Addons bring more ease too this but they are supposed to be optionnal.
---
So Easier content in 1.12 + Easier fight with addons = really easy PvE content.
---
I like both!
---
Hpal for freedom.
---
I'll be playing horde, even though night elf hunters are great.
---
They changed the winterspring mount rep, too. It was mind-numbingly boring the old way but feeling forced to do the daily was worse.
---
You‚Äôll be using a bow (rhok delar) for a very very long time.
---
What is the name of the addon adding a bar at the top and bottom screen ?
---
Lol no
---
No one was worried they would shard different servers together... That literally goes against every tenant of recreating authentic Vanilla WoW. I can't believe this needs months of explanation and discussion. Layering, is the exact same fucking thing as sharding in the eyes of people not retarded enough to think they would layer/shard different servers together.
---
You are extremely lucky, congratulations :)
---
You are doing the hunters a favor tbh. No one wants to be grouped with you anyway, thanks for blacklisting yourself.
---
Yeah - I'm putting mine in on the 1st - if nothing else than to sync it with my other bills.
---
I absolutely hate how tanking works in vanilla. Healing is okay and I intend to play priest but man, warrior is boring and tanking with it is even more boring... 
---
On the other hand, cataclysm prot paladin or blood DK are great tanks that I enjoy from the bottom of my soul.
---
Watching old raiding videos of top world guilds, yeah they were pretty fucking retarded. A 12 year old gamer today has way more gamesense.
---
Windfury is better than shadow oil if you encounter a raid boss with high shadow resit and low armor
---
I got a little nervous when that hunter came up with it's pet, but I smiled when he put that good boi away.
---
BRD is the first one that always feels like it matters and feels like an achievment when first completed. Ill do most of them while leveling but if i end up skipping some i wont care. Maybe scarlet monastery is one id almost never skip, too.
---
Dont worry I have enough tanks+mages in friendlist. My warrior buddies dont mind if there is less competition for wpns+accessories.

Hi, /u/DTJN
---
Its a closed beta though.
---
I hastily chose Sunken Temple because &lt;3 ... but then saw results with SM at the top and... yeah, that one was great, too.
---
I'm pumped for all of them!
---
How?
---
Jokes on them, I'm a complete moron.
---
&gt; Do nothing else but duels all day? 
---
At Lvl 30 Sir!
---
Classic bosses have higher resist than on pservers so yeah still better.
---
Someone‚Äôs mad for no reason
---
Black Fathom Depths, because I get a great wand as a quest reward for putting up with it.
---
I dislike him the most of all the big streamers. He‚Äôs very whiny and thinks he knows anything about vanilla when really he doesn‚Äôt know shit.
---
I cannot wait to load up on BRD quests with 4 guildies and spend half a Saturday doing the entire thing.
---
Blizzard is allowing anyone with an active subscription to login to the realm selection screen, pick a realm, and then create and name up to 3 characters (per account, not per realm) on August 12th.
---
They look a little like that garbage pile on the ground, pictured above.
---
titanpanel
---
But the WF totem and the WF enhancement didn't stack? For double proc chance?
---
As I said, thank you. I like when bad people filter themself out. Makes life easier for me.
---
So pretty much no bosses.
---
gl with that limited raidspot and possible other people who dont want you in dungeon grp.
---
Correct. No stacking.
---
This is peak dunning kruger effect lmao.
---
Does anyone know if there is a link confirming this and where you'll be able to do it?
---
Already have a raidspot and I dont really need to pug anyway. I couldnt care less what bad players think.
---
Wait a minute! So the 1% miss chance that you can never get rid of DOES apply to melee?! o:
---
Feel free to share this anywhere you feel it could garner attention. The more people who use this the easier it will be to find people to level with!
---
Indeed
---
More hype for me on launch
---
We always knew there was an invisible 1% miss chance we just didn't know the reason for it and the nuances.
---
Sure.
---
You race traitor.
---
If you are indeed hunter then you have good connections and history. Its only way you will ever get spot. Over 90% hunters wont get spot.
---
A well played Druid would be excellent with a hunter.
---
Keep in mind that I haven't played vanilla since... well BC, but from memory:
---
Level 1-10 is hard, because you have abilities that you probably won't want to use after you get other ones, heroic strike and rend should only ever be used if you have nothing else to spend rage on.
---
Rend. The rage to damage compensation is simply not worth it. you use rend to keep a rogue from re-stealthing in pvp, other than that you don't use it.
---
Heroic strike, unless you are tanking, or need to dump rage. White damage is your rage generation, heroic strike is "On next attack" and not an instant which means you no longer get any rage from that attack, since it's no longer white damage, but an ability. Not only are you spending your rage on the attack itself, you are denying yourself rage, essentially "double dipping". Avoid if using a two hander outside specific scenarios which are such edge cases You would know your class well enough to know to use it by the time you get there.
---
Battleshout is far more important than rend, since higher AP means more white damage - more white damage means more rage. Keep in mind in vanilla, Damage = Rage, the more you do, the more rage you get, which is why Gear is so important, if you hit hard, you have far more rage to burn, which is why warriors had such massive scaling issues in vanilla (weak with standard gear, unstoppable killing machines with good gear)
---
Some extra suggestions:
---
*  Never use slam. It was useless in vanilla.
---
* 31 point talent (mortal strike for example) Makes all the difference in the world, as you now have an Instant
---
* Learn to stance dance, swapping to beserker to use whirlwind, hit beserker rage, then swap back to mortal strike gives you extra attacks you wouldn't get if you just sat it in the same stance.
---
* Be prepared for a slow grind if solo, The lack of self heal and the fact that you will almost ALWAYS take damage since you are in melee, means downtime between every fight. I would highly recommend a friend, a shaman if at all possible as a windfury totem turns a warrior into an absolute death machine (windfury proc = more white damage - more white damage = more rage - more rage = more abilities used = Even more windfury procs! - EVEN MORE RAGE - it's a self filling loop)
---
* Don't expect to take on multiple enemies. fight one at a time if at all possible if alone. Warriors are not equipped for easily dealing with multiple enemies, and you will need to pull off some more advanced techniques if you want to survive it.
---
* Don't level as Prot. You may want to be a tank when you are higher level, but unless you are doing all your leveling in a group, you will only make the process even slower for yourself.
---
A good (emphasis on good) druid can be invaluable. Constant HoTs, the ability to root melee classes allowing you to keep your distance, cleansing poison negating crippling poison's effect, their own great mobility and survivability. It always made an amazing duo.
---
UBRS. Although I already fear the misunderstanding that is going to happen due to my native language (german).
---
While UBRS stands for Upper Blackrockspire it's reffered to as "Obere Blackrockspitze" in german (OBRS) and LBRS is called - yep... you guessed it - "Untere Blackrocksptize" (UBRS).
---
I hope people will use the english acronyms that were actually used on german Vanilla servers. Yet somehow they got forgotten over the years.
---
Of course they know it's impossible to hide what servers they're on. What they meant was  hiding as best they can until they're done with the starting zone so they don't have a horde of trolls right out the gates.
---
Three things you should do while leveling a warrior:
---
1. Go 2h fury (pick up bloodcraze especially)
---
2. Don't neglect spirit
---
3. Level cooking and first aid
---
Do these three things and you will not have any problems killing or managing your health during downtime. Spirit is really strong and if you get enough of it (without sacrificing too much in other stats) you will be regenning almost all of your lost hp from your last fight before you get into the next. Fury has great talents for levelling too, increasing your damage by 25% if you get critted and healing you for 3% of your hp also, which is basically the amount of extra damage the crit has done to you anyway. It also has flurry which when combined with a 2h makes rage gen less of a problem and combined with a good weapon, once you crit you end up destroying whatever you're fighting quickly. Cooking and first aid doesn't need to be explained.
---
Also, never heroic strike unless you have tons of rage and you're in danger of going over 100. Instead you should apply rend and hamstring and actually hope either of them get dodged or parried so you can smack the mob with an overpower. Later on you can cast slam as a finisher instead of execute to keep your rage between fights.
---
Do what you feel is right.
---
Although - it's kind of mean :O
---
Nope.. I'm just going to install one and hope it works
---
The police sure have, him and his dad have been hit with $800k in fraud charges.
---
Blackrock Depths
---
When I first started playing i didn't like going there. You had to go back in endless times for different quests, it's huge and maze-like, took forever. 
---
Over time I came to love it for what it is. It's the kind of place people think about when they talk about  "a dungeon adventure". 
---
Ran it so much over the span of vanilla I started hating it again, but I've got very fond memories of it, so I'm stoked to delve back in. 
---
One thing's for sure though - as I'm going to be playing a warrior like 15 years ago, I will be hating that place again sooner rather than later, depending on drop luck.
---
Ziqo and Venruki are really really good players obviously.. but they are nothing special (yet) on classic
---
2700$ Pog what an expensive joke that is
---
Maraudon princess side
---
thx
---
The base tick rate of WoW is what, 0.4 seconds?
---
It's not a fast game. You don't need every ability bound to a button.
---
That said, there's no excuse for not using your 1-5 buttons at least. I mean, they're *right there*.
---
I remember 17% being in game until MoP
---
I also don't think it prioritized it. But blizzard will know.
---
I also feel like the inconsistent focus regen was a thing back then. But that will also be looked into.
---
Thank you.
---
So there is no specific stat like it correlates with higher "int" to make it viable to have an int Shaman in Meele and all day WF procs or something.
---
And only more instant hits means more procs.
---
Therefore the previous argument that I read is invalid.
---
 (Shaman has higher proc rate than Others, since in a Raid there will always be a WF totem available for a Meele DD group). For cool special effects
---
You haven‚Äôt been around long enough to get the joke. Lol.
---
Minor thing, but the Orgrimmar and Undercity text is placed directly over the original text when Stormwind and Ironforge is placed beneath the original text.
---
I mean I played all the expansions, besides most of panda and wod, in panda I would still hop on and do dumb stuff every now and then, and in wod I got to lol 93 then deployed and forgot to unsub.
---
No, in PVP slow weapons are favored even more. You're moving a lot, rarely getting multiple shots off in a row. And when you are getting multiple shots off in a row, there's hardly any "damn, if only my weapon hit for less but was 0.3 seconds faster, I would have won!"
---
Always rogue. *Always. *
---
Hands of Justice is Pre raid BiS trinket for hunter. Change my mind
---
It'll be there-just remember its alliance only and the human diplomacy racial does prove to be useful. As others have said it'll be a very very long grind but hey you could have a very unique mount!
---
Well, half is more than 1/3 so op success
---
One of the best aspects of FFXIV is that there are no addons IMO.  Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the case for WoW, so you really just have to embrace it and have fun with them.  Setting up my perfect UI almost because a mini game for me.
---
Is there a map like this one that shows the "not accessible by normal means" places? Like the Emerald Dream or the GM Island.
---
But wow is based on 1v1 at lvl30?
---
THey are actually so bad that competent raids take a SINGLE druid for a 40 man raid and only for the buff not even the bres. All theese bs what i read about "they provide so much utility" fuck they don't. They have innervate which relivess 1 mana potion on 1 guy every 3 minute and most likely just has a single use / boss, bress is not good as if its needed it's already bad , and now u are left with faerie fire which while valuable can be substituted by like at least 3 armor lowering weapons . So realistically you are left with thorns which also has pretty easy consumable replace and gift of the wild. No , mate . Druids providing "lot of utility" is a myth nothing more. There is a reason why they are considered by far the worst lvl60 class in vanilla.
---
Druid is basically a bonus Pet for the Hunter ... Maybe people will be confused and think you are only 1 player.
---
And the healing routing kiting bonus is also nice.
---
Maybe Mage for more kiting and bursting Power.
---
And that you have a nice combo of magic dmg and physical dmg.
---
Also probably viable is a Ele shaman for more burst but not as good in kiting as an mage
---
Thats actually a good idea!  
---
But there are also so many tanks that dont wait for me to drink. It is so annoying. Because of that I will block all warriors and go with druids.
---
And while we are talking about druids: Have you realized that most of them are to dumb to compete in DPS with other classes and when they heal they arent really better? Its laughable so I decided to block them, too.
---
Ah so you don't have a guide that would work for a high population server either. It's easy to complain when you don't have a solution.
---
The private server community is not playing WC 3 month before Classic. Thats tourists.
---
He is being carried but not because of his lazyness or lack of effort, its because the class just can't keep up...but he loves the class and want to stick with it so more power to him! But if a player is that dedicated and the bosses are still "going down" I don't mind having a subpar specc in my ranks...I know that dedication will pay off one way or another, not on damage meters but on some other stuff guild and community related.
---
Now the potential problem is if you end up having to many people playing a "meme specc" as you put it...that can be problematic. Not to mention most people wont do what it does and wont put everything they got into the specc to make it some what decent or at least close to it.
---
I dont know much about the guy but he is the Knightfall Axe wielder? If he is, he is bringing some utility since on Alliance side I honestly don't know who is often in charge on using the axe, maybe the 3rd tank?
---
In PUG it's naturally true, however I'm talking about the guild experience. If you avoid it, then you are doing something wrong imo. And within a well functioning community, there will be place for any spec.
---
The seeking of 'efficency' starts as the players got bored of the repetitiveness of the available content and that is the mark when the casuals start to give up and find fun elsewhere.
---
I don't think they got hamstring until BC
---
Isnt there a neutral flight path in felwood in Emerald sanctuary, or is that something that was added later? Also its bugging me that gnomer is green like a main city and doesnt have level text like other dungeons. Very cool overall though! Good work
---
That's gonna be a lifesaver
---
It's taken into calculation when addressing the chance of glancing blows, so that's another thing. Data from the beta shows that the parry is level based.
---
Almost all waopons*, one handed and two handed mace not. That hand of rag looks great on hunter though, not gonna lie I'd go for it
---
Hes doing Gods work.
---
I think at this point it's mostly just people memeing rather than actual hate
---
GM Island is northwest of Kalimdor and would be accessible, but it wouldn't make sense to include the emerald dream as it isn't from either of them.
---
Design decision where they wanted to create a distinct difference between dungeons and raids. They wanted raids to feel epic and massive with 40 or 20 players and dungeons more off a group thing with 5 or 10 players.
---
Sorry
---
Fury pala?
---
The more player-run the economy is, the better. I would say that WoW is a limited free-marked, since most of your gear will not be from crafting/AH, but BoP's from dungeons and quests. There are also some major "leaks" in the WoW economy, such as mounts and repairs. 
---
EVE-online is a game where nearly every aspect of the economy is run by the players. Every ship (apart from the first few tutorial ships), turret, drones, missiles, implants etc was crafted by a player and sold on the market. 
---
But, WoW and EVE are two completly different game's with very different objectives. In WoW, the economy is a lot "simpler" because the game is more about doing dungeons, raids and battlegrounds. In EVE, you don't have dungeons, it's a game where you build up your own source of income so you can buy cool shit and hunt down ships with your buddies in low-sec (PvP zones).
---
That's not my work, please read my comment :D
---
Man I loved this post, perfect read on a boring tuesday at work.  thank you!
---
Full BRD quest runs bruh.
---
Haha fuck, if Payo doesn't wanna make you play a rogue, I don't know who will haha
---
You mean like the lord and savior asmongold.
---
True chads buy those cards from russian websites where they have 'fallen' off the truck
---
English is not my primary language so I am used to bad grammar and misspelling. Hence I look past it and try extracting what the person is trying to say. I have to say that OP made it a challenge xD
---
Druid, Shaman, Priest
---
Telling your friend who wants to raid that he can play a Shadow Priest
---
How many warlocks? 2-3?
---
Ahh ok. It's been so long I forgot. Thanks.
---
Thanks for writing this post! I completely understand where you're coming from and certain songs have the same effect on me and takes me back to azeroth aswell. Best wishes for the future of classic wow to you bro!
---
Development on Deadly Boss Mods didn't start until August 3, 2008.
---
So no, you didn't use DBM.
---
BigWigs development started April 9, 2006. You may have used that.
---
I did this 15 years ago before the changes and I think I spent like 3-4 months. Gonna do it again. Just wanted to be sure it's still in the game as there's so many different patches and classic uses some random ones. But yeah, seems it was in the game pretty much from the beginning, or something. [I don't mind boring and tedious stuff.](https://i.imgur.com/vuCLQyH.jpg)
---
At least 4.
---
People dont hate pallys, they just hate the players who play pallys who aren't holy. Ret is insanely mediocre in terms of DPS and prot is just straight up the worst spec in vanilla and utterly useless outside 2 dungeons.
---
Dude this is awesome
---
I had a hunter need on Feline Mantle from SFK because it had agility on it. Yeah. I was lucky I already had them, but swiftly had him kicked so he couldn‚Äôt do the same with Arugal‚Äôs drop. I don‚Äôt care if there‚Äôs agility on it, if you need on cloth as a hunter you‚Äôre a fucking retard
---
Another reason to be excited for Classic - we can again admire art assets that have been removed from retail over the years, like the ones quivers use
---
I'm pretty sure that Esfand mostly gets his spot, not because he overcommite himself to the cause, but because he's a fun guy. The timeinvolvement does help tho.
---
Hi, /u/Kraven54
---
Cant Agree more - one of the tvings Im famous for is grinding, getting in the zone and just jamming to music or a great series
---
The swords combined is actrually a pretty bad weapon compared to the 1 handers.
---
Every warrior claims that
---
I mean if I would like to play with mature normal players which side should I choose?
---
No, my journey was a bit less harrowing than yours level-wise :) I was able to stay alive by staying on the path and taking my time. I can't remember if I died or not (its likely i died at least once in the wetlands where the raptor nest is by the trail or where the orcs patrol the mountain pass but I don't recall. I do remember the elation as I first entered Ironforge and saw all the high level players for the first time. 
---
There was a warlock out dueling out front putting the hurt on all comers (this was before the 8 second limit on fear or any diminishing returns). there was a team of players hunting a troll rogue in the underground tram area too. It was very exciting compared to the relative quiet of teldrassil.
---
Atleast I got into the stress test
---
Snowfall - activates key bindings on press rather than on release.
---
The biggest problem I see is not that you don't want any hybrid dps, but you may lack healers.
---
Awesome Story, keep up the chill vibes!
---
 "they Will always do a 180 turn and run away. So you can face them  towards their camp - to Make them turn and run away from them rather  than pulling more "
---
That's a private server thing, streamers show the mobs going in random directions.
---
My comment was a quote from Charlie's Angels. Tom Green says "WAS IT THE CHAD?!"
---
I mostly agree with you but there is one thing you are not taking into consideration and neither did I until very recently.
---
I was approached by an old friend of mine, also a WoW veteran, to form a guild to Classic...at 1st I refused, "dude raids are 40man, think about managing that, think about recruiting that many people!!"
---
But I gather around old and new WoW players alike that I played with along the years and he did the same and we have around 20 people and we will probably going for it, see how it goes, at least during phase 1 we will try make it work.
---
Now "meme speccs" or subpar speccs hurt high end progression guilds ofc, it will hurt a more casual guild like us as well since the min maxing level is lower to begin with, so carrying them will be harder right? Well, yes and no...
---
In a perfect scenario, we recruit, we form the core raiding group and everything is perfect!
---
But in a realistic scenario recruiting and most importantly maintain people will always be a struggle (or at least I think it will) so what is best? Accepting sub par classes/specs and have an easy time forming the guild/group? Or block all the non optimal raiding specs and force people to play the best class/spec or even wait for new people to show up with the classes we do want to raid with...
---
Also, in a more casual guild, in my personal opinion, its more profitable trusting and "carrying" your reliable Feral Druid friend of many years or a Ret Paladin guy that you played with before than benching or not even counting with them and just try and get a random rogue or fury warrior!
---
In the long run I think its better for the guild as long as the raiding group doesn't start to get tons of meme specs just for the fun of it!
---
There was one duel he had against Payo where he took literally no damage in the duel.
---
Pretentious aunt
---
That's peak /r/classicwow logic right there.
---
Since you can speak english now , I assume you are rich :) congratz
---
Gotta make some sort of pre-plan effort to get the scepter in your server right?
---
Slash S.
---
You WHAT? All of his videos are nothing but bs with completely false or incorrect info, the other part of his videos are reading out 4 lines of blizzard announcements lines by lines and talking nonsense inbetween for 10 minutes for no reason.
---
Srsly idk who tipsout is irl, idk if he really played or vanilla or not but his content is the type waht we call in my country a "living-off youtuber" whos content should be just deleted from youtube as it servers no purpose to exists at all.
---
Go find some real vanilla youtubers.
---
Well, in my point of view you just "look at"
---
How many people KNOW after the fight boss timer abilities for example ?
---
 If you know something you remember it. Knowledge mean after using thoses addons few times you could do without them as good as with them.
---
What monitor settings do you people have that white being on the screen blinds you?
---
This is the UI I aim to use: https://github.com/Ko0z/zUI
---
Check it out, awesome work!
---
Take 1 sec to google and you'll see it's just a rumour started by some players who want them.
---
Tank is a great roll for a casual player in terms of PvE for everything except raiding.  You can pretty much get a group for any dungeon you want on demand.  Tanks need to be the most dedicated and consistent players in a raiding environment, however.  And they do in fact suck bad at anything that‚Äôs not tanking PvE content. 
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd suggest going with a HotW Druid.  Allows you to tank and heal any dungeon, off tank in raids, heal in raids, and is actually solid in PvP also.
---
Do the AV mounts benefit from the 10% PVP rank 3 vendor discount and the honoured (or exalted?) faction discount? I'm sure I paid close to 600g for my AV mount but can't see how. When 1.12 came in they upgraded my mount skill because I had the mount already, which was nice.
---
He has a refreshingly positive attitude and brings a lot of enthusiasm to the classic community. I like him.
---
Literally good job
---
Fixed the link now, we tend to hang around Discord more though. Already getting to know each other
---
Every rogues name starting with "Dark" again
---
My bad :)
---
I just want to guarantee that me and my friends have the same home server.
---
If my friend runs into "awesomeguy1" when hes playing without me, i want to be able to see awesomeguy1 in town later and feel like the world is connected.
---
If me and my friend are playing with entirely different people when were alone, were not playing in the same world. Layering is still a shit sollution even if it's not as bad as layering.
---
If you want to get involved, send Magey#0001 a message on discord, and he'll direct you to the right place.
---
You are absolutely, indisputably wrong. The meta in vanilla has evolved. Bears are better than warriors in T0/T1 content, fall somewhat behind in BWL due to a gearing gap, and then surge forward again in AQ40/Naxx. Bears produce more threat per second than warriors except warriors who tank dual wielding using the prot/fury hybrid build. 
---
Survival is not a big concern for modern tanks, who wear the actual best gear (not wildheart or valor) to raid. Bears get crit/crushed - but it doesn't matter because they survive and generate dope threat. Go educate yourself.

You just need 3-4 to make it work, and they only need to be level 20.  You can leave them in starter zones and just do a rotation- Eurostar, barrens, Trisfal, Mulgore

I would say up it to 40 until end of June, to 50 until end of July and up to 60 until release. Enough time to test every single thing and instance etc.

True vanilla hunter gameplay right here boys.
---
With sharding/layering I honestly can‚Äôt see how this would be much of an issue.

My setup will be
---
1. Priest (me)
---
2. Tank: Druid/Warrior
---
3. Mage (sheep+water)
---
4. Rogue
---
5. Dps warrior/druid/paladin
---
Thing is for me even tho i know that dung inside out my reaction will be like this:
---
\-Leveling my warrior.
---
\-Whisper arrives "hey dude wanna tank ST ? :)"
---
\-proceed to put the guy who whispered into ignore list.
---
Seriously fuck ST. Unless you are a skinner 0 reason to go down. Takes 3 hours to clear it . Some1 has to run group disbands because they still can't look up how to get into the instance alone. No bis loot there , the entire thing is just a fkin wasting of time.
---
&gt;Tl: dr; If you haven't done so already, I highly recommend you to include the choice of music in your preparations for the launch of Classic.
---
Only casuals play without sound. I'm saying this unironically.

Actual sub numbers of course not, possibly new or resubs? Possibly. I'd imagine that with retail still waiting on 8.2 they're not gaining many new subs right now

---
Another hunter. Both go BM and /dance while your 2 pets solo everyone lol
---
You're using a lot of terms I've forgotten over the last decade or so and I'm not clicking that link. However, I feel like you're talking about hard-core raiders with the top tier gear but the people asking these questions are NOT falling into that category. For 95% of players looking to raid, prot is the way to go. Advising random people to roll a bear to tank 40 man raids is going to end up with a lot of sad druids.
---
Ah yes, the Toon of Theseus thought experiment.
---
Manslayer of Qiraji holds a special place in my memories. This was the weapon when I (Warrior) stopped being a victim in PVP and started dominating. It also looks sick and is one of the slower 2hand swords out there.
---
Not quite, my friend! I wish. Luckily English is just more of an open resource nowadays, and for those who do not speak English they'll have some great country specific servers/guilds for them to enjoy the full experience. 
---
I can't wait for it!
---
+5 weapon skill is an average 8% increase to white damage, which is about 45% to 55% of your overall damage as a swords rogue. 
---
That's a ~3.6% to ~4.4% damage increase.
---
Windfury Totem is an extra 5% to 10% damage.
---
Humans just don't compete.

---
You‚Äôre right, if I spend that 15 dollars two weeks earlier my entire family and cat will starve to death!
---
some might just smoke sum
---
Yeah but it looked so cool, and it had the rare factor.... And I played a paladin (during BC since I was horde) and thought the sword was great especially for leveling....I never payed attention to it because I played rogue in vanilla
---
STDs are BOP
---
"person based AoE" actually
---
God damn that‚Äôs what wow is all about.  Beautiful story.  When I got to ungoro I was so proud after so many attempts to kill one of those trivial lasher mobs just because of the skill level.
---
Gnome was fun....but I'm going to play horde so no reason to even look at it
---
What about the +5 bow skill. Considering the last blue post with the hit % chance. Doesn't it favor using bow for the first phase ? I know 5 bow skill isn't as strong as melee weapons skill.
---
The biggest difference is gear by far. Original 1.1.0 gear and 1.12 is really massive, not only way more availability, but more stats and the actual mechanics were buffed, spirit and spell power in particular. 
---
Gear has so many implications which trivialize boss fights, they are much shorter due to way more dps; so less healing required; more stam means more surviability, spirit is more powerful so less need likely to go OOM etc.
---
Didn't his youtube channel get created only a few days after the official classic announcement ? That doesnt sound like "supported classic before it was the "hot new thing" " to me.
---
I was expecting to read you were in a coma and WoW music made you realize you needed to wake up.
---
I would have chose a bunch. But I wanted to make people think hard about the absolute best one in their mind....it is easy to get a top 5 but what makes one the best
---
Long run back and Rez timers can fix the problem
---
Haha nice
---
Arise and fight once more
---
Unless you're able to keep track of everything down to the millisecond in your head, you don't know, you just have an idea. That's not the same thing.
---
Ohh wow, I remember that now. I haven't thought about that in years. Thanks for the laugh.
---
This, especially considering if the warrior's bis weapon is a 2H.
---
As an Alliance who corpse-ran through Orgrimmar just to do SFK at level 12 you shut your mouth
---
2800-3200 hp furry warrior full pre raid biss , if i recall correctly 3 k and above was with buffs.
---
You can grab a Chosrutulkrldjss (Nefarian 1h axe) for TPS after your top fury DW has gotten it
---
Gnome named Bridget
---
Mage because of sheep.
---
Ready to grind some Zhevra hooves!
---
Also can‚Äôt wait for the old zones and for my gear to matter! I will be scouring the new thottbot for reasonable gear upgrades and profession patterns!
---
BRD is great but it just takes so long.....which is both a great thing and a bad thing (if you have mimited time to play)
---
Already maining mage because I know it's fun and pretty good in pvp and pve.
---
World of Warriorcraft.
---
Well, it wasn't the greatest of conversations to begin with. All based on an assumption of large server populations taken from... Well nowhere.
---
They are working on recreating the vanilla feel and you assume they'll flood the servers with waaaaaaay more people than they had in vanilla, based on a video where they don't mention anything about the population cap.
---
Playing without sound is =/= playing with music. You can mute the ingame music and still keep that nasty rogue stealth sound for example. However good and iconic the soundtrack is, everything gets old eventually.
---
There are plenty of purists that would have corrected me
---
Laughs in 2h fury slam spec
---
Swords for days bruhhhhh (also don't have to compete with rogues and DW warriors for weapons)
---
Theres more non wow playing streamers in the beta than europeans.
---
I wouldnt get my hopes up \^\^
---
 Not to mention that, *at best*, it nets them one extra monthly of subs, so to think that a cash grab is fueling this even a little bit is more for the tin foil hat crowd than anything. 
---
The only slight hiccup in this theory is that if the plan were to potential roll out additional servers on launch day it would somewhat negate the whole name reservation thing for those additional servers.
---
I think the server lists are set, or pretty close to being set, and this will essentially be a final stress test to see how many layers will be required at launch per server.
---
you're delusional. they aren't raising the level cap, get a grip on life
---
Tabbing usually works.  occasionally ive gad to click on a guy but 9/10 times tab is fine
---
I was surprised, it's usually known as laserchicken. But oh well.
---
It's why I play on RP PvE servers. Obnoxious people who shout in all caps after a wipe do not play there.
---
Haha that is quite funny :D +1 for that! 
---
Need more of those Posts in this reddit ;)
---
Shaman's would like a word.
---
That was so great.. 15 man. 15 potentially people to open eggs :D
---
Eh, it can wait. I‚Äôve got 11 more weeks of training at work to keep me more than occupied.
---
Try resto druid or disc priest
---
Be a warlock.
---
Bring two mates.
---
Dive deeeep with water breathing.
---
Summon people üëå.
---
gnomeregan is insanely good for horde, you get a free tp to the entrance from booty bay with great quest rewards.
---
Yes, and don't forget everybody needs a Cloth Robe because everybody wants to be a princess, so just block everybody and go full multibox
---
To this day, any song from Zero 7s 'simple things' takes me back to farming devilsaur leather in un'goro
---
 This shows me that wow needs more snow zones. I do enjoy a good snow crunch noise, the winter winds blowing, the soft fall of snow flakes, and then a good flurry. Winter regions are always my favorite.
---
I‚Äôll look into disc priest. Haven‚Äôt gotten that far into priest and just figured shadow had the dps opportunity. Thanks for the input
---
Imagine being this low IQ lmao
---
I mean, you're not wrong; and at  least you have the balls to say it, unlike most.
---
And Paladins are bis treasure chest ninjas. So rouge those rogues.
---
Well... not too useful that set... I would definitely screenshot this post and come back in a year or so when you reached R14 :P 
---
Gotta prove em haters wrong :D
---
GL on your Mission :) get a premade ready :D
---
Unless you want tl willingly do less damage then no.
---
Way too many factors
---
If I wanted to craft my stuff as I go, usually mining and bs, later on I dropped mining for some other crafting like alchemy
---
Shamans, Shadow Priests, Locks, and Druids are hard counters to mages.
---
So, if You go Alliance, You'll have a hard time as a mage since there are much more priests and locks on Horde (because of WotF) and Shamans are Horde exclusive.
---
Its where my first epic dropped (gut ripper). I was the only rogue in the group so it was easy to ninja. Then I sold it for &gt;100g and bought my mount. Good times.
---
Nope - if you bring a prot warrior with a shield to raid he will produce so little TPS (this is vanillla-like) your dps will be standing around waiting for them to churn out more threat. This will be especially hard on your warriors (the top dps in vanilla) and you won't be able to use them for anything close to their full potential. Your tank will survive, but so would a druid, so that argument is moot. 
---
So, if you want to be stubborn, bring the prot warrior w. shield and warn your dps warriors, warlocks, and healers to bring a book to raid.
---
You stayed at mining and got alchemy? No collecting profession?
---
Alliance if you prefer steep rent and oppressive taxes, steroid fuelled chads, vacuous anorexic women and dwarves with poor hygiene and inferior beards to Tauren.
---
Horde if you enjoy being close to nature, living in close-knit communities and having the freedom to experiment with substances that the Alliance leaders and officials actively campaign against (whilst they get wasted in private). 
---
I've seen Jaina take ketamine and Katrana Prestor is always rubbing her nose.
---
I like that classic model
---
Is that because it's like 2-3 tanks needed but 12 or so healers?
---
In the end I dropped mining and got alchemy, and kept blacksmithing
---
Two words: Thekal's Grasp
---
So if people are bored of having "nothing to do" in the current iteration of wow when new content is being added every few months or so, what are they going to do when they're basically playing an RPG with a definite endgame? Don't get me wrong, I'm going to dabble in classic a bit, but mostly how I dabble in steam games here and there.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br1hXGXJ7Tg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br1hXGXJ7Tg) 
---
They are godlike players then ? About threat you can see he is just including Feint in his rotation and not only using it we needed. It's not that hard, i think ?
---
I'm not against addons. It's just sad that people find them essential like if the game was designed to be clear only with thoses addons.
---
Perhaps when everyone even casuals will crush every raids, people will react.
---
Me and my brother usually watch movies or shows while we play. There will be times when we rewatch a movie or tv show and it‚Äôll take me back to exactly what I was doing in wow. Just a certain point in the movie and that point in wow are connected in my brain. Super interesting stuff!
---
nope, I'm already a mage main and I know firsthand we get slapped by warlocks at 60 and rogues that spam fap.
---
level 30 duels are irrelevant (and ven shouldn't of won that anyway)
---
Dire Maul because it's the only one I haven't ran two thousand times.
---
I can't speak for him but some people like myself just keybind auto attack from the keybinding menu so you don't waste precious bar space.
---
Honestly...
---
I think there is nothing to be done about that :D
---
There used to be this Kind of behavious in classic. Private Servers probably just compiled all those toxic Players in a Server.
---
When Classic Releases there will be so many Players "new" to classic that the toxic Players will be the minority.
---
If someone is too toxic, just kick him - simple as that!
---
No Need for tryhards - I just want to enjoy the game!
---
I think the toxicity rises from Players that have been playing classic for a Long time and they just can't take People making mistakes anymore... I guess classic is not for them afterall :D
---
Oh summoning was great for pranks. In TBC I used to summon sub-60 people to the floating rocks near the Twilight Ridge in Nagrand. There wasn't even land below for their dead bodies to hit. But as with most summoning shenanigans, make sure their hearthstone is on cooldown.
---
Just play on pservers dude
---
They never guaranteed that everyone who had a sub would get beta. Obviously not everyone who has a sub will get a beta - it was always a slim chance.
---
StunWatch, assuming it works
---
Can you add some brief discriptions to what each add on does for us who haven't touch wow in 10 years, like what does the deadly boss one do?
---
Ilvl is meaningless. First ilvl doesnt exist in classic and second im pretty sure the ilvls they have now is based on raidtiers and stuff like that. Thats not how classic works. An extreme example is feral druid. Their bis weapon is a level 29 blue weapon and their bis helmet is a lvl 40 blue too, both for the wntirity of classic. Tell me, what ilvl do those have compared with lvl 60 epics?
---
Honestly, Monk on retail... really not a whole lot comes to mind with the word 'ebb and flow' of combat in classic for me... Shaman may be close in classic, diverse heals with totems and other debuffing shenanigans, and it can be a beast at damage when it comes to PvP
---
How it is low iq? That is avarage number of hunters in raid. Mage and locks are prio.
---
 [https://lightshope.org/stats](https://lightshope.org/stats) 
---
Thats lot of hunters compared raidspots they get.  Also go google "raid composition vanilla"
---
Insane...I'm rolling hunter but if 90% of this isn't fixed i wont be.
---
Pretty much gold drops from bosses.  Each boss is a few gold per person if you are a full raid, and there‚Äôs like 10+bosses in each of the raids.
---
When you get a big upgrade, you really notice. 
---
Especially on a warrior - since in addition to doing more damage, it also gives you faster rage generation.
---
It's fun in that sense. I don't know if casters can get that same feeling from upgrading any single slot.
---
Sword spec / thrash blade / windfury procs are nuts if you have a 2H weapon.
---
The fiery weapon enchant is a big deal when you first get it. That thing procs all the time.
---
The axe from Harold in the scarlet monastary has that spin-you-around proc, which is mostly annoying but is funny for a while.
---
Some are not fun exactly, but characterful: e.g. the barman shanker dagger for a rogue is very good, but has a chance to proc a long-duration bleed that will prevent you from gouging or blinding the guy as part of a stun lock...so sort of a mixed blessing.
---
So you make a video, put it on youtube then go to reddit and make a title implying it's not you but "this guy" :thinking:
---
 I believe this is correct, which is why so many bank alts are DE machines. 
---
 However, when leveling there are a TON of BoP quest rewards and possible dungeon drops that can't be dent to tgat DE matching bank alt. Easy missed income... But everyone has their preferences, I'll be enchanting on my main.
---
Haha I lost like 60 dislikes on this. Dont mind spend my "points" now and then.
---
I got 600 easily though from just saying how shit game of thrones was.
---
In PvE noone would doubt that, hardest rotation in vanilla is like 3 buttons.
---
In Duels however, especially in a bo3 format the game is as or even more complicated than today.
---
This right here is Super Saiyan 3 levels of tryhard neckbeard shit.
---
Black Rock depth is in the Lead? WTF did everyone forgot this madness or is this sub high?
---
Omg xD
---
Really cant wait to have my hunter's two - one handed swords back !
---
Was leaning alliance but shaman might persuade me to head horde. Haven‚Äôt given them a pserver run so I might do just that.
---
Once the cost of supplies stabilize and you have a decent amount of money theres no need to get your own herbs anymore.
---
https://imgflip.com/i/32m45j
---
It's you, so why "this guy" ? Loool.
---
I don't remember that but you could kite warriors by staying in a dead zone between their melee range and their charge range. Something like between 5-8 yards.
---
when spells miss, you will get the "ressist" message.   this is why hunters for example has talents that increase hit chance, but also a talent that decreases the chance traps will be resisted.    
---
this is basically spell hit, vs regular hit chances.     
---
i dont know how the utility spells of a warrior work in this regard though, but it doesnt allways have to do with resistance on the enemy
---
Maybe both. BRD was insanly hard and huge and annoying....but that's also what made it so fun and rewarding and immersive
---
Literal god
---
His guide works fine for fresh servers, just need to group up to share tags
---
Ohohoho brutal.
---
Teach me your ways master
---
this is great for holy paladins. because it is harder to notice that i have specced for PVP talents in prot, and ignored the improved blessing of might in retribution.
---
Unethical. The true pure ethical vanilla experience requires you to play with no addons.
---
Which two brd bosses did you farm on your warrior?
---
Imagine fighting somebody for 40 minutes and then having him bubble-hearth away.
---
oh my god i bought this from ebay last month and had a blast playing it. it feels exactly like wow, just as a board game.
---
i fucking love it, perfect thing to do till classic arrives
---
The number of items is not really relevant. It's the ratio of supply and demand. Considering more players equals higher supply of items, but also equally higher supply of demand, all in all it should be equivalent nevermind the amount of players in total.
---
Having your pet sit by your side in the range camp and only howl is a lot of wasted damage, especially regarding its range and not buffing melees in your group.
---
Stuff like pet management and melee weaving will seperate the bad from the decent and the very good hunters.
---
Finding a rogue is always the difficult part.
---
Since hunters can't have a glancing blow, the +5 skill is only worth 3% +hit and 0.2% +crit.
---
Hunters only need +9% to hit and it's very easy to get from gear (there's also 3% in talents, but once you get it from gear, you spec away from Surefooted).
---
The ZG enchant gives 1% each for both slots and it's all over the Tier gear. But sure, without the need for 3% hit, Trolls have a tiny bit more freedom in min/maxing, but not much.
---
The most obvious comparison is the scopes. Biznicks gives +3% hit. Since Trolls don't need it, they can get a Sniper Scope that gives +7 damage. For Rhok'delar, that's an extra 3.89 DPS in your rotation. For Soulstring, it's an extra 3.89 DPS in your rotation. Meaning they still don't compare.
---
&lt;Blood Killlers&gt; yes please
---
Most people don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre bored of Wow. The truth is they‚Äôre not bored because of ‚Äúnothing to do‚Äù or even because of poor itemization. They‚Äôre bored because the core fundamental gameplay of WoW is broken. Classic wow won‚Äôt have 8 million raids. But all you need to have fun is a bare bone game and, you know, gameplay.
---
Accept, walk 2 steps, get one shotted my a random lvl 60 rogue in hillsbrad footil.
---
Maybe send him a DM on stream? He often enough answers such questions when he reads them and @ him is a good way to make your post stand out. Or ask him on Twitter ( [https://twitter.com/Sequisha](https://twitter.com/Sequisha) ). That may even be the better option.
---
If you are sure you will make it to 4 horseman in Nax you could strive for soul string which is a bow and second best range weapon in the game for hunters.
---
Otherwise you‚Äôll have a hard time.
---
The authentic world PvP experience. Killing lowbies who cant fight back.
---
PS: I think he leveled Fury but is now Arms spec, iirc.........
---
But it has always been dungeons, even if they're instanced lol. The "purist" aren't that pure in this case.
---
It is a closed beta - and I who never played a Hunter in Classic am not sure if some of those weren`t in classic too. Some might have been.
---
I think in the 2 years they did a lot of other things beside Fixing bugs which they have to find first.
---
I mean it is the reason to have a beta - so Players can find the bugs and Report them
---
But I see what you mean... It is still 2 month's though so no worries :)
---
Actually did not know that.
---
 Thanks for the reply that is very interesting
---
Some pserver players are quite obnoxious and have r/gatekeeping vibes to them. I could see why people find those annoying
---
Tbh Stam cant save you from top geared Shamans.
---
Do you know when we will be able to download the client? Early August I‚Äôm assuming?
---
It's not Jimmy's fault there is a Scryer quest to fuck Mojache's mom.
---
Never thought id hear the term Wilks Formula here.  I dont think anything exists as of yet but you could always build a tool that takes into consideration optimal dps for BiS gear and compares you against it.  A weekend with a little bit of python should do it.
---
Haha, I can definately relate to this. I came from Runescape where all training XP except a few quests which gave mediocre XP, was gained from grinding. So my first character was a Nelf Rogue, I did the Teldrassil quests, then spent the majority of the next 11 days played time killing mobs and doing the very occasional quest. It wasnt until my second character a Paladin that I actually did all the Vanilla questing as intended.
---
"please delete your wtf folder and disable all customer user interface addons"
---
I think most guilds, even ones that are PvP friendly, operate on the general rule of raid spec &gt; PvP spec. 
---
Generally loot in a loot council is distributed in a way that focuses on making raid content as easy as possible. I don't see a world where a holy paladin will ever get onslaught girdle for their PvP spec before all of the fury warriors have it.
---
I tried to do this in Vanilla and I gave up halfway trough orsomething like that. then I had spent surely 2.5 months orso. I never went back to try again. Totally broke me.
---
They explicitly said there will be no new content. (Ion in an interview before the beta.)
---
The thing is, playing with the music you like increases your concentration. In other words you'll be way more focused on Boss Mechanics or in PvP. Guess you're the casual here.
---
"Poor little Luckystrike", anyone? :)
---
"utterly useless" please talk more out of your ass
---
This is you.
---
You will never be a famous, wealthy Youtuber.
---
It would be a hybrid build, little of all 3 spec lines.
---
8/11/32, would let you pick up Wand Spec, Imp PWS, and Holy Nova.
---
Sorry champ but it is, there is exactly zero reason to bring a prot paladin to a raid.
---
Why are you pretending he's someone else? You're not even using a different username lol. I think "he" is the former.
---
The explicitly stated there will be no new content. (Ion in an interview before the beta.)
---
What they are open to is TBC/Wrath servers.
---
"lots of people plays alliance"
---
lots of cunts...
---
Esfand always tells everyone NOT to play ret, but go ahead and stroke your imagination a little bit more lol
---
I wouldn't call a 7 minute Rag kill "godlike" anymore when the record is 20 seconds. Speedrunning and speedkilling is the only hardcore mode left in Vanilla WoW.
---
With an addon, the rogue would have *known* if and when he needed to feint in order to keep his threat lower than the tank, if at all. For some, that extra energy consumption could be the difference in DPS between a boss kill and a boss wipe. For others, it means seconds and minutes off a clock.
---
You can go through all of Vanilla clicking your abilities instead of binding them to keys. Doesn't mean you should.
---
You can go through all of Vanilla without using addons. Doesn't mean you should.
---
I'm planning to come home from work, go the gym, and eat dinner then play for ~2 hours. And like 18 hours a day on weekends
---
Why are you talking about raids when your first post refers to dungeons? Clear your mind
---
!remind me in 5 days
---
What do you mean name reservation? How can you reserve a name when beta characters get wiped, and you can't create characters until early August?
---
They told but Not sure. Because I am top 2 in FF but since friday. So maybe there is a delay.
---
Wait, why wouldn‚Äôt you just trigger auto shot with a ranged ability? I‚Äôve always started it with the poison shot or arcane shot (sometimes concussive shot) and haven‚Äôt had a problem. Why would you want auto-shot on the bar?
---
Yea, it will. I personally really, really prefer the new macro api.
---
&gt;min/maxers are secretly bad players because they need to optimize their play for something not that challenging in the first place
---
This. (sort of)
---
When the game was new and people were learning encounters and pushing for world firsts etc on the latest end game raids - then I am fine with min/maxing
---
Joe Average demanding FOTM specs for his groups to run through Scholo or Strat after 14 years can get noodled.  5 and 10 mans just need a little co-ordination and teamwork, specs are secondary there
---
Maraudon original mode.
---
And scholomance original.
---
And strat
---
Haha, different currency are not valued the same compared to each other..
---
I doubt it will be sooner than August 12th. They may even leave most of the client download until launch day or at least some major pre-load before and just have a shell of a client available for making your characters.
---
There were addons from the jump, dude.
---
It's something like:
---
say the proc is 6 procs-per-minute (like fiery weapon). That means the chance for it to proc scales with the weapon speed, such that if you're just auto-attacking, it goes off about 6 times per minute. So, for example:
---
 \- speed 1.5 weapon, would hit 40 times per minute, so it has a 15% chance proc on each hit (to give 6 procs in a minute).
---
 \- speed 4.0 weapon, would hit 15 times per minute, so it has a 40% chance to proc on each hit (to give 6 procs in a minute).
---
The sneaky bit is: that chance also applies on all of your instant attacks, not just auto attacks.
---
So if you do 10 mortal strikes and 6 whirlwinds and 4 hamstrings per minute in addition to your autoattacks ... those 20 attacks give you 3 more procs with the 1.5 speed weapon (20 \* 15%) but 8 more procs with the 4.0 speed weapon (20 \* 40%). 
---
So you wind up getting more procs with the slower weapon, because of your instant attacks.
---
Guilty!
---
You're gonna have to go back and reread it again bud, I said utterly useless OUTSIDE 2 dungeons(strat and scholo if you didn't catch that). Obviously I wasn't only referring too dungeons. But I get that you were confused. OUTSIDE of strat and scholo prot paladins have no use, they are inferior to both warriors and druids. Their lack of taunt just makes them bad and their TPS doesn't even surpass druids so they have no leg to stand on. If your spec cannot justify its existence then yes it is utterly useless.
---
&gt;  First ilvl doesnt exist in classic
---
### Wrong.
---
All items have itemlevels, and always had. They just didn't get displayed in the UI until WotLK, but could easily be gathered from datamining.
---
[Here](http://www.classicdb.ch/?items=2.2#0-2+1) you have the complete assortment of Vanilla bows, sorted by their ilvl (second column after the name)
---
&gt;im pretty sure the ilvls they have now is based on raidtiers and stuff like that
---
They coincide with them, but ilvl, in essence, is just a baseline stat tha determines how much of each stat/sec.stat/special effects an item is allowed to have.
---
&gt; Thats not how classic works
---
Classic works exactly like this.  
---
Here you have the [T1](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=16809), [T2](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=16931), and [T3](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=22504) robes of the warlock. As you can see, the itemlevel rises steadily throughput the raid-tiers, from 66, to 76, to 92.
---
&gt;Their bis weapon is a level 29 blue weapon
---
The [Manual Crowd Pummeler](http://www.classicdb.ch/?item=9449#comments) only serves as the endgame weapon, because Feral Druids in Vanilla don't rely on a weapons dps, and the active on this item is better for them than anything in the game.
---
----
---
Thanks for proving conclusively that you have no idea how classic itemization works. You may leave now.
---
You could consider it the only legendary mount in the game, because getting it has nothing to do with luck. The Stratholme Horse might look cool, but all it says is "this guy got lucky". In a game where everything is about grinding and endurance the Frostsaber says "this guy is made of iron".
---
&gt; When the game was new and people were learning encounters and pushing for world firsts etc on the latest end game raids - then I am fine with min/maxing
---
Even back in 2005-2006, we cleared Naxx 40 and while we did min/max, it probably wasn't to the degree private server nerds take it and tell everyone how good they are (then you see videos of them sucking horribly in the beta like tipsout...)
---
I also planned 9 days for having 2 weeks off and playing the game. I have like 23-4 days left.
---
I even plan counting some sick-days, for like a week or something.
---
But I don't know how much of that will end up being the truth, of me playing entire day. I will drop on 5-6% bodyfat when classic comes out since i'm in my prep. Maybe first week sure.   
---
I need to count in some mobility work, some maintenance calories, even some gym work....
---
I'm still working out the plan.
---
Here is the plan: We set up a list, first one on that subscribes, starts streaming wow bfa, legion, trial whatever.. We here at the sub all start to watch/view bot. - &gt; Gets beta key, on to the next person...  /j
---
Jokes aside, I still have that annoying voice in my head that naggingly says "~ It is Activision now!" and "Remember when... "
---
 There is a freakin huge list!!! Starts with ignoring community for years!! I even had this voice when I gave in to w3 reforged.. (not mobile yet) and I actually still feel bad.. not to mention the pre-order shame... Even though they are (I hope) on the right track now.. Still... Meh... That voice is here to stay I am afraid.
---
I spent a lot of time in classic talking to GM's, it was always an entertaining event, me and my buddies would always read the chat out on Ventrillo as it was happening, and as the convo was coming to a close "Remember to ask him for a joke!" and the GM would always respond with the best Dad WoW jokes. I don't even remember talking to a GM after TBC.
---
What is up with all these troll post recently. I think people are getting really restless.
---
I once placed this exact portal after we did an achievement run on an old raid. Leader took the portal, died and banned me from the Teamspeak Server. Needless to say i would so ist again.
---
Interesting post. I agree. It‚Äôs kind of like anything you totally focus on can make you more relaxed kind of like meditation, as long as you are having fun.
---
Any machine will run it these days. To play vanilla WoW, either find a private server now like me or wait august 27 2019 for the WoW classic release on battlenet.
---
This is when I resub!
---
Took a week off of work. Going to wake up at around 6:45am to eat and then go to the gym. Get home to eat and shower. Should be around 12 in the afternoon by then. Then just sit on my ass for 11-12hours until I go to sleep to start it all over again.
---
Ele sham is pretty good (ele resto hybrid) with blue gear.
---
If you don't plan on raiding AQ onwards I take it you quit the game once AQ launches? PvPing vs people in AQ gear, without having AQ gear yourself, is like a level 60 facing a level 30 character. No chance, just quit.
---
Ahh ok thanks for the reply. If that is true I probably won‚Äôt be playing on launch, but that‚Äôs ok.
---
I have taken the week from August 26 - 30 off and still have two more weeks off starting September 20. I'm gonna prepare myself mentally on Monday, clean my apartment, do all the other housekeeping stuff that I won't have time for when Classic hits and will make sure to have my fridge full of nice (and hopefully not too unhealthy) things (but no guarantees there.....). So looking forward to it. &lt;3
---
ZA has bears, ZG has hakkar, ZF is a leveling dungeon
---
Best peel in the game. Sheep, nova and bolt slows.
---
Druid, Mage, Warlock or Shaman would be my guess.
---
I personally PvP with a friend who played warlock... and we kicked a lot ass and did shit that that would normally take a group of 5 players to get done.
---
*good memories*
---
Exactly how I understood it, and yes a warrior or a bear is a better tank but that doesn't mean that prot pallies are "utterly useless", nothing more to say there
---
Each class has a different conversion rate from the spirit stat into mana/sec regen. Shaman and paladins have particularly mediocre conversion rates which is why when combined with their need to chain cast they tend to favor mp5, where druids have a very high conversion rate, probably to support their ability to regain mana fast while in animal forms.
---
Thanks for proving conclusively you have autism.
---
Nah he is not gonna use nightfall, he is gonna get first onslaught girdle, first ashkandi or BRE, first chromatic boots. if your class needs every consumable and wbuff to do shit dps its bad period.
---
Yes it does, if someone else can completely out perform you in everyway that makes you useless. Id seriously suggest a different spec before launch.
---
Already told HR that I shall be off for two weeks, starting at the 27th of August :P
---
The only thing that could posisbly change that, is if there is an important customer coming out of the blue, and I have to take care of them (sorry Classic, a huge pile of cash in my yearly bonus &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you :D)
---
If you submit your ticket as if you are RPing,  most of the time they will reply back at least attempting to RP.
---
you need to save your drugs for classic launch
---
Tell me the secret, please!
---
As far as I remember in actual classic ret paladins used spare devout, etc and healed in MC ret spec.  They could help with farming and be a nuisance in pvp, having a presence, important for EPL on pvp servers.  
---
From reading the comments it seems pserver players don‚Äôt appreciate that option for some reason, which seems wild as a horde player.
---
Your abilites reset attack timer so it is optimal to time them with attacks for higher dmg. It‚Äôs best to start with autoattack and cast shot while projectile flies.
---
well, we won't be hearing from you again, that's for sure.
---
They might have a hidden ilvl but its irrelevant. Except for rokdhelar, hunters dont wanna use any bow after that. I am aware why manual crowd pummeler is good, its still bis, any particular reason why you ignored the helmet? And yes higher tier sets have higher ilvl which is just what i did say too.
---
August 26-Sept 7 :)
---
In most guilds the player's attitude and commitment make more of a difference and dps meters are really just fun tools for people to compete with. Most guilds would rather have someone that's fun to raid with and doesn't cause raidwipes over someone who might technically put out good numbers but is otherwise an insufferable ass. I think that's the main factor as to why people haven't been itching for a more accurate formula of raider skill.
---
What realm you gonna go on so I can gank you with my hunter
---
2¬Ω weeks, 26th -&gt; 12th.
---
Just gonna have a chill time, play a lot - but not 24/7.
---
They used to merge servers when this became a problem. I thought this worked well but they stopped doing it. Potentially because blizzard make a lot more money from people paying for server transfers.
---
Pretty sure it was a joke dude
---
You need 7% hit or so to hit the cap iirc, you nab! =P
---
he downvoted this thread
---
i'm also speaking in the third person about myself
---
I used to have a mod that let me add a note to a friend and I put info there about players I friended and ran with.
---
Back when everyone was on the same server... you knew who was good and who was bad and well you earned your rep and people knew if you could play your class and get the job done.
---
I'll take two weeks off if I can.
---
I have 20 days with no work and no responsibilities.
---
4 vacation days. So I get 6 days of no lifing until the next work week starts.
---
I wish I could use more, but I've already used all of my 36 days at that point. But I'm becoming a father this summer, which the government will reward me with almost 400 days of leave with 80% pay, so I'll probably apply for more vacation in September/October.
---
You're such a cool dude woweee
---
Shut up, no.
---
Herb/alch if you want to raid unless you want to be the dedicated weapon/armoursmith of your guild. Blacksmithing is a huge pain in the ass if you're merely leveling it for sharpening stones imho.
---
&gt;healing and debuffing, with the ability to pop off on DPS.
---
Well, the Shadowpriest has some healing via damage by ways of Vampiric Embrace, and it can "pop off" nicely.
---
You just have to make sure of two things:
---
* Don't pull aggro (this happens quite easily)
---
* Manage Mana carefully (SPs go OOM easily)
---
i'll be off from the 25th till the 2nd
---
You‚Äôre going to do much longer quests than that in vanilla, I wouldn‚Äôt be deterred from a class quest. Poisons and lock picking are not difficult, and mage will be a lot of fun.
---
Play the class that most interests you from a class fantasy perspective and go with that.
---
in the early classic days a few friends used to share details of their accounts in case we needed specific classes for stuff or needed their trade skills. 
---
we'd mostly use this to take their characters to somewhere annoying, far from a flight path and delete their hearthstone. hearing the 'oh ffs!' on ventrilo when they logged in was gold.
---
Huh, I‚Äôll keep that in mind. Thanks! 
---
I‚Äôm almost 100% positive I‚Äôm going to be the huntard I hated 14 years ago.
---
I‚Äôve not seen this on private servers. The people I run into are always friendly. Never had an issue in a dungeon group either.
---
Ya that doesn't sound right.
---
Just honest guy, saying things how they are.
---
I add tanks+mages as friend and we wont pick any hunters. Warrior dont mind that eather considered he doesnt have to compete for weapon.
---
UBRS for sure, pls do not drop after getting the eyes...
---
That's awesome.
---
When I look back I think: "Woah, that had to be the most boring and tedious grind ever!", but back in time I was just having fun, I was not worried about leveling to 60 (I didn't even know raids existed), I was just chilling, growing my character, exploring the world... To me the super vast and open world was just a dream come true, I felt completely immersed.
---
And then, after meeting few people from my country, we set up a group to help people from our country with a much lower levels: Guided them through dungeons, shared knowledge on how to do the few quests we knew how to do, etc. It was awesome.
---
After 10 years or whatever after, I still hold those people dear, and many of them I AM LUCKY to still call them friends to this day, we would go on to help people until language-specific servers were released, which, by the time were not so necessary to us since we learnt English... THANKS TO THE GAME!
---
Sounds crazy but my best and only English teacher was WOW... It was our motivation to learn and enjoy the game we LOVED that made us, somehow, unexplainably, learn a language from the scratch.
---
Can't wait to contribute as much as I can to the community after vanilla goes live!
---
Hey, the Mercedes amg gt has around 500hp while an BMW M3 only has 400hp, the bmw must be UTTERLY USELESS lol And ty I won't play prot pally, I just dislike people that dont know what they're talking about
---
I'm thinking of say taking off the second or third week in September. Launch week is going to be a mess and I'd rather spend time finishing off the 40's/50's than spending vacation time competing for low level quests and kills.
---
Ganna also do every single UC quest for rep, and anything else (idk if 1.12 gives global faction rep for quest completion or not) and try to get as close as possible to UC exalted for that skeletal warhorse at 60. Since we got no PvP system until phase 2, ganna go for my favorite mount instead.
---
You wont have gear to gank. Hunters get 2-3 raidspots and its overused.
---
So I guess the pure meele classes like rouge and warrior have more additional instant hits/per min than mixed like shaman, hunter, pala or droids?
---
Yeah you've said like 3 or 4 times bro, get over yourself
---
Not once BWL is available...
---
I have a 7 day on 7 day off schedule (I work 10 hour days) starting the end of August. I‚Äôm planing on taking an extra 2 days of PTO. It‚Äôs going to be wild
---
It absolutely is r14 insane.
---
Loved this, I always loved the more realistic character models that can be seen in some of those screenshots. The human female in the SW Inn, and the Gnome Female, also everything looked a bit darker. I vaguely remember playing pre-release versions of Vanilla and being slightly disappointed with Gnomes.
---
Rogue/Hunter is a weak combo in wsg, but in wpvp it is great.
---
I'd say mage for maximum CC and positional play.
---
Yeah thats not really a comparable argument at all. Please present an actual counter argument or im gonna just have to assume you're trolling. Thank you.
---
You're wearing a suit?
---
Not enough it seems based on most answers.
---
Funniest part is that they are shit in raid so only few will get spot. Must feel like dumbasses being 60.
---
Stop playing private servers. In vanilla people took who was available
---
My favorite was when people used to say "Here is my account details, I'm on Holiday". Logging on as Alliance, taking their character to Oggrimar, leave all their gear in the bank, farm a set of greens from RFC, and leave them on top of the bank with no Hearthstone. Wait a week, enjoy hilarity.
---
Allied races are supposed to be a BFA feature but you still have to grind Legion rep to unlock 4 of them. Especially doesn‚Äôt make sense for players who skipped Legion and have 0 rep for those factions.
---
So like, a macro that will sheep my mouseover target, but if I'm not mousing over anyone, it would sheep my current target.
---
&gt;  but its irrelevant.
---
That is absolutely true, but your statement was "ilvl doesn not exist in classic", and my point was pointing out that this is simply wrong.
---
&gt;any particular reason why you ignored the helmet
---
Yes, and a quite simple one:  
---
I remembered the name of the Pummeler, but not of the helmet, and simply was too lazy to look for it (still am). If you provide the name, I'll be happy to comment on it.
---
&gt;which is just what i did say too
---
No, you sad, and I quote:  
---
_"ilvl doesnt exist in classic"_
---
Werent you talking about dungeons though?   you can be the best druid healer in the world, but if billy the frostmage dies on an AOE pack in maraudon, you are now 4 manning for the next.. many... minutes.. unless you combat ress him which has a very long cooldown.   
---
i would bring a pala or priest over a druid any day of the week.   call it min/max or tryharding if you want, for me it is just more convenient to have a ress while farming dungeons
---
Ashjre'thul from BWL is better than Soulstring for Hunters...
---
You ok bud? I thought you had a stroke there for a second :)
---
Yeah in shitty guilds.. I plan to play past bwl and sorry to say bro but they are shit endgame.
---
Strat UD side, I ran it so much with my tank warrior back in the day. Usually with the same people as well. It was just so much fun!
---
Rhok is awesome, but eventually you go Ash, and it's simply better so at that point using bows is a waste.
---
Stuff like the ZG bow may look neat but it puts out less dps than even Carapace Spine Crossbow.
---
I was one of the guys who leveled so slowly and rerolled so often that once my first character hit levl 60 the guild was about to start raiding. So I went directly into raids with crap-gear and without really seeing much of the level 60 dungeons.
---
So I'm mostly looking forward to Dire Maul, as this is the dungeon I have the vaguest memories about. I've done DM-North and East maybe once overall. West, for some reason I don't remember, I've seen more often.
---
Most of my Lvl 60 Vanilla memories are tied to Zul Gurub though. That's where I actually progressed through over the course of several weeks without getting frustrated or bored.
---
I had one album from Motion City Soundtrack that I played on repeat while leveling a Druid. Every time I hear that album I‚Äôm automatically transported back into Hillsbrad Foothills getting ganked in the yeti cave, then logging onto my main to get some sweet revenge. Which was then followed by them logging into their main and ganking me. Which led to me getting everyone nearby to raid South Shore. After a couple hours it calms down and I go back to leveling my Druid....memories.
---
You can do perfectly fine as a clicker unless you want to kite things or be excellent in pvp.
---
&gt; new races are easy money
---
I don't think that's why.  If it was about money, they wouldn't block people from spending $60 to get through most of the leveling process and be able to still get the heritage armor sets.
---
People kept asking for new races, Blizzard gave them new races.  It's really that simple.  But since so many people have this weird urge to claim everything Blizzard does now is evil and they used to be soooo much better, it's easier to claim it's about money than admit that hey, people asked for this stuff.  Really, that's the biggest problem with the game now.  People asked for stuff, Blizzard gave it to them, people then proceeded to say they don't want the stuff they asked for and want to return to how things were... where they'll again start asking for stuff that they'll later claim they don't want and is just done to make money or "appeal to Fortnite kids" (a hilarious term because usually the people who use such terms are people I'd consider "kids").
---
&gt;It made curses trivial, as they were removed on the whole raid within 5 sec.
---
I think you are forgetting global cooldown in that estimation.
---
Maybe allow multiple choices at races?
---
Breakfast: 15 minutes
---
Gym: 60 minutes
---
Shower: 15 minutes
---
Lunch: 30 minutes
---
What are you doing with the other 75 minutes?
---
You're horribly overestimating the difference high server pop makes. Joana's guide is still excellent.
---
You won‚Äôt be allowed to use debuts as a rogue in raids. Also Maxes and stubs have nothing to do with each other. Go swords like everyone else... unless you manage to get a good mace at 60 instead of a sword.
---
Why on earth do you believe the private server community is starting new characters 3 month before Classic? Its obviously tourists checking out Vanilla before Classic.
---
Bet you've never even played vanilla, keep watching your YouTube videos and min/maxing guides, sperg lord
---
Not gonna do anything special, no days off, no junk food, no tight schedule maybe a lan day at most with one of my friend haha. I dont want to burn through contents and feel like ive done everything that is available after 2 weeks i want to take it slow , plus the few first days would be a mess
---
Ah glorious Winterspring. I return to your unblemished snow soon...
---
Probably would've said the same thing as someone that can't admit they're wrong, have a good one
---
&gt; The thing is, playing with the music you like increases your concentration.
---
Source?
---
Geez man.  So many bad points.  
---
1.  When they released those mario games and FF games the kids who only played mario galaxy and sunshine or FFXV weren‚Äôt all hyped up to play the NES version...at all.  
---
2.  Mario and Final Fantasy didn‚Äôt release release a prior patch to an existing popular game...there is no WoW 2...there are only expansions...mario/FF released dozens of sequels and then rereleased original separate games. 
---
3.  At no point did i say private servers had millions of people.  That was an invention of your own onehead brain.  
---
/pwnd.
---
and never look back!
---
i guess it's just because they want to feel like their time spent is "legit", instead of a private server which can shut down at any time.    
---
I get it, but I'm not resubbing just for a chance at getting into the beta. I'll train for now so that when official servers go live, I can at least feel like I"m ahead of the curve. Can't wait to get lost in this gaming knowing that there will be official and long-term supported communities
---
You aint alone buddy.
---
MSA from naxx beats out everything that isn't Death's Sting, and the +4 maces mace from AQ40 is insanely good.
---
In raids this is what class leaders are for. 
---
In dungeons just pay attention and it should be pretty noticeable who is carrying their weight.
---
I gave a proper argument to my stance and you did not. Sad you feel the need to wastes peoples time.
---
That is probably the lamest attempt at self-promotion I have ever seen.
---
### You used the same username both here and on youtube, and tried pretending it's someone else  :D :D :D
---
Also, and it's really important to me that you know that:
---
* Your microphone is bad
---
* Your voice is something I wouldn't listen to for more than 2 minutes
---
* Making a "video" that is basically a stillframe is nonsensical
---
* Who the fuck wears a suit when recording
---
No wonder you just have 32 subscribers :D
---
Yes you are
---
You can look at the code repositories yourself and see every piece of code as it was submitted at the exact time it was submitted.
---
It's honestly dumb not letting people who resub into the beta, because it's cutting into potential profits. I would 100% resub at the chance to play the beta, but I have zero desire to play retail wow at all.
---
&gt; To decurse/dispell 40 man raid you would need 13-14 people doing it optimally. 
---
Thats what the addon did. 
---
It litterary decursed for you, and having 13 mages / druids was common.
---
Of course, long term a guild would like to keep you because of your personality.
---
Really want to mess with them sap/blind/gouge combo and cc them for a good 30 sec and just repeat off cd
---
What do you wanna comment on the helmet? Are you gonna say again that it is strong because of the effect? Yeah i know why its strong, doesnt change the fact that its ilvl is pretty low. Fine you said all those things because i said that ilvl wasnt a thing and not because i said its irrelevant. Just like the reason i replied to you in the first place is because you mentioned ilvl as if it was any metric for how good an item is which is wrong as you have now agreed. Why did you make your initial comment then? Ilvl doesnt matter and while yes he can play whatever the fuck he wants with whatever weapons he wants but does he want to play a bow only troll if he cares about minmaxing? No. The only bow he wants is the one from MC, which might serve him a few months but after that he should just use xbows if he wants to do the most damage his character can do.
---
Even in BWL and AQ.
---
!RemindMe 86days
---
Blizzard code monkey #1: *"Guys, we fuk'd with the formulas in production code and kinda fuk'd up and now we cant restore the default values"*
---
Omar: *"Just make something up then and explain the discrepancy with MAGIK"*
---
Blizzard code monkey #1: *"will do baws"*
---
It shows bar timers of (raid) boss abilities, like Onyxias fire breath. Cant remember if it had something in 5-10man endgame instances. So yeah, you are not going to need that in levelup.
---
Damn that is amazing! Hope you enjoy the game as much as back then! :P
---
And don¬¥t make her ignore you again! :D
---
Grokky you cheeky dwarf, see you in Nethergarde .
---
I will probably happen onces the game matures and people dont have anything else to compete with other than top parses.
---
Reminds me of an old (shitty) vid I made back in vanilla! https://youtu.be/bIm0OdtuDAo Though she didn‚Äôt go bankrupt, but got straight up raped and murdered.. and her name was sliiightly different!
---
&gt; I really hope they spend and focus the development resources in something more relevant to the current Wow.
---
Lmao, cope.
---
This is cool. On the flipside, never put a song you like as your wakeup alarm in the morning or you'll start hating it.
---
Week 1 Rag Kill
---
This month and next: Practice speedleveling, practice clearing MC in greens, practice not sleeping.
---
August: Rest up and make it up to the girlfriend.
---
Launch: Lots and lots of Adderall.
---
Live to win on loop, what more do you need?
---
I'm getting sent to a different country to work for 6 weeks, 7 days before classic comes out. I don't even know if I will have internet :/ at least I don't need to worry about how cramped the start zone will be.
---
You dont understand 1.12 meta. Having right raid composition is very important downing bosses. They do shit damage and dont bring anything specific to table what other classes cant do better. 1 hunter is enough.
---
Most hunters will be benched and replaced with other classes once 40men get started. And smart raid leaders knows this too.
---
Wand spec ftw.  Then get that wand that did physical damage from ZG once it comes out and absolutely melt cloth classes in battlegrounds.
---
&gt; Also phasing fucking sucks.
---
That's not "phasing," that's CRZ (cross-realm zones).  Got introduced a while back because people weren't doing the leveling zones anymore, so they felt kind of empty, so the "solution" was to have the zones pull in a number of people regardless of realm.  Which in theory does make the world seem more populated, but can lead to issues where there's now more people in an area than quest respawns can handle, and it doesn't load the CRZ you'll be in until you land from a flight path, which can lead to bad situations like NPCScan telling you something's up (i.e. the Time-Lost Proto Drake), but then you land and get shunted into a CRZ where it's not up.
---
Phasing's just the term used for when a zone or (more often) part of a zone changes due to something happening in a quest.  I.e. you complete a quest for your faction to set a foothold in an area, suddenly a hub transforms into a small fort.  Or the way Tirisfal Glades is "normal" if you haven't done the BFA quests, but once you do them, the city's covered in Blight and there's a burnt scar across the land where the Alliance drove in to besiege the city.  Usually people in a zone will do the same quests so see the same things.
---
Pvp focused guild from the private server scene.
---
You're right that's how most guilds behave. But I think that's probably not necessary. Apart from tank loot, you don't need to make use of every-single-item that drops. Rare items aren't functionally necessary for your raid to advance, they're more like a 'reward.'
---
Admittedly, it's better if that reward ends up directly benefiting the raid, i.e. your damage player hits harder. But where does that leave players who raid for the sole purpose of collecting PVP loot? Since that's where virtually all the PVP items happen to be. If we say "they can wait", we both know that wait may never end. You can easily go 3 months between rare item drops. If you're behind 12 others, the chance of *ever* getting what you're playing to get becomes slim-to-none.
---
How would you feel about letting people access desirable PVP items as though they were main spec, provided that the raider is some kind of "verified" pvper? i.e. They're in battlegrounds all the time, they're at least rank 7+, something like that.

No, the crossbow off of Chromaggus is way better and remains best-in-slot until you can get the crossbow from Naxx.

What happened to person #18 on the layered one? Do they not get to play? :(
---
You should get dial-up internet to really get the classic experience.
---
Im no genius but that guy seems like a fraud D:!
---
GMs still occasionally word their responses in an RP like fashion, they can often be quite an interesting read, however the majority I've had are more or less basic responses.
---
This is interesting, because I noticed this myself but then the other way around. Back in the day I only listened to the World of Warcraft songs while playing. After a while I noticed these songs really help me to focus at work, but to an extreme level where I get a shitload of work done and time flies. Whenever I have to get shit done now, I open Spotify and put on some World of Warcraft music (usually starting with the login screen song, so immersive).   
---
It might be interesting to get a playlist going that aren't just World of Warcraft songs. But somehow I also like the fact that I'm listening to these classic World of Warcraft songs again while playing. Guess I haven't made up my mind yet.
---
Lol ilvl, get outta here :D
---
All seems perfectly inline with what you want. They think they will be ready to get your money and let you play classic in few month.
---
it looks great. I have to test it and how the raid frames are :)
---
Sure
---
Its funny I‚Äôve usually gotten most of Blizzards Betas eventually, but never really had much desire to play any of them except for a few (Starcraft n‚Äô Legion). It just kills my motivation when you play for everything just to get taken away from you again, so I have no issues with waiting til August with playing.

&gt;R/Classicwow: DoN‚Äôt ChAnGe AnYtHiNg!!!!1111  
---
&gt;Also r/Classicwow: Here‚Äôs a list of 20 mandatory addons for launch.
---
These are not mutually exclusive though - I played from EU launch and I remember having titan panel, decursive, some bag mod and a Frames/UI mod installed fairly early on.
---
Pick up some organic fair trade coffee in Asheville for those extended leveling sessions! Lol!
---
Man I loved the ol South shore throwdown back before they introduced battlegrounds. Sure wish they could have found a way to keep the non-instanced world vibrant since BGs were the end of that kind of thing
---
If you send your pet to taunt **BEFORE** you attack a mob your pet will return to your side and sit there for a second before accepting new commands. I can repeat this bug without problem.   Will get some video this evening.
---
Blizzard.... partner with Games Workshop already and let me spend all my money on plastic warcraft armies!!!! 
---
Doing what I can with other things.... check out my WIP of Illidan Stormrage @humpelminis on instagram üòÖ
---
2 Weeks free, wife and kids are going away for a week to visit family then I might pay for them to go on holiday for the second if I can convince the wife its a good idea.
---
Plan on playing for 16/18 hr/d, Shower as soon as I wake up, eating during flight paths and downtime and should hopefully get my druid to 60 in that time, then after my 2 weeks ill be dropping down to 3 hours a day roughly due to real life.
---
Layering will minorly impact the feel of a large connected world, however after playing on private servers, and knowing there is no dynamic spawning in classic, this will be a godsend, I'd much rather have a small amount of division but have a chance of killing quest mobs in an appropriate time frame.
---
i plan to go to work, then to the gym and eat dinner and play 4 hours a night 4 days a week
---
on the weekends i will play anywhere from 0 hours a day to 12 hours a day
---
I once got into a hour long deathmatch with a gnome warlock over the turtles along the revantusk village shore.
---
I was leveling enhancement and everytime i'd get on him he'd rapidly drag the fight into the deepest waters because he had that belt and underwater breathing. 
---
As a shaman I had access to waterwalking making me a bit of a water specialist myself, the attack/run game between us took forever.
---
We could've just shared the turtles but no. :))
---
&gt; as you have now agreed. 
---
I didn't need to "agree" on this, as this was clear from the get go, and I assume that this is clear to the audience on a subreddit about Classic WoW. Since I never said otherwise anywhere, your conclusion that this was my meaning, is not my fault, but yours, for misinterpreting what I wrote.
---
&gt;Why did you make your initial comment then?
---
Because OP asked specifically about ITEM PROGRESSION in a very narrow loot-field. I wanted to point out that there is a steady progression of Bows through the raid/content tiers. As ilvl is an (alebit clumsy) metric for the progression level when an item pops up, I used that.
---
&gt;The only bow he wants is the one from MC, which might serve him a few months but after that he should just use xbows if he wants to do the most damage his character can do.
---
And we continue the misinterpretation.
---
OP asked SPECIFICALLY about the possibility to only use bows. Whether or not that makes sense from a performance-PoV, is completely irrelevant.
---
If you answer questions with the premise that the question itself should not be asked, you are of no help to the one posting the question.
---
the way the border of the wow logo blends into the map's logo seems strange, perverse, wrong, 10/10.
---
Druid for the root, heal and complementary dps
---
How the hell could a face like that betray the Horde?
---
...and in 800x600 with a CRT the size of a toilet hardlocked at 30FPS with 15FPS dips under load.
---
Gotta come back to play that classic!
---
The quest giver in Orgrimmar for Gnomer will teleport you to the entrance, and award you a blue item of your choice.  From healers to rogues and hunters and warriors, everyone at that level wants to go.
---
I think im going to raw dog it for a little then sprinkle the addons as i go.
---
They were always called instances on most of the servers I played on until maybe MoP.
---
The people that called them dungeons back in the day were the kind of people who call DPS, DD and call Deadmines, VC xD
---
Awesome!
---
I‚Äôve gotten so used to Opie for menus I hope they support it.
---
Its definitely wrong but i'm not a coding guy.
---
wow this guy is good.

Shut up and go make a meme, dork

---
IMO Buying stuff if you are a clicker is too much at one. 
---
Start out small with a regular mouse. You have more than enough for most classes just with a keyboard and mouse.
---
(\^ 1 2 3 4 5 Q E R F Y X C V )+ Shift, 28 active abilities
---
Mouse wheel (Up&amp;Down&amp;Click) + Shift, 6 for your Cooldowns, (if you want to play around with camera heights, bind them to numpad 2&amp;8)
---
I would also advice you if you play different classes, make kind of a pattern for yourself.
---
Like slow on E, Stun on Q, Interrupt on R, MouseUp offensive Cd, MouseDown deffensive CD. All that for different classes so you get somewhat of a muscle memory with it.
---

---
thanks mate! so good as a starting point to edit as I would like to (hp bars only current number and not fraction) and so on, hope ElvUI can get it done to classic release
---
Yeah raiding and level cap was a totally alien concept to me, I think all the pieces finally fell together at about 55 when my friends linked me to epic gear on thottbot, and I said "Dayum I'm getting me some of that Bloodfang". Still friends with some old Vanilla buddies 15 years later too, crazy to think all this time later and we are going at it again together.
---
If OP asked about the possibility regardless of it making sense then that would have been the dumbest thread ever. You could just as well have said that yes hunters start with a bow and you will never have to get rid of it so yes it is "possible"
---
You should see Paladin vs priest then you‚Äôll enjoy that matchup the most in vanilla /s
---
Maraudon original mode, where the blobs were so toxic, even the rogues had to learn "ranged dps."  Mages had a ball learning to kite them, and healers keeping them alive.
---
Strongly recommend you play a warrior or druid and tank dungeons. It's going to cut down on the time it takes you to get a group together *massively*. Or, go healer, though tanks are still harder to find. If you can log in and get a group going straight away you could finish several dungeons a night within a few hours.
---
PUG raids should probably be left for weekends.
---
I was already subbed from when I was still raiding this expansion and remained subbed because of classic. I think that because for the first time since I started playing 15 years ago, I'm done with expansion, and I'm just going to unsub until august.
---
Maybe I'll put that sub money toward a fake sub to Warframe for now, or something
---
I have resubbed hoping to get a stress test invite as it is a massive fun.
---
I have no invitation yet but I enjoy the BfA storyline on Retail, it's a decent ~~MMO~~RPG action game.
---
Unfortunately, most of my college students are real buzzkills about me canceling the first week of classes, so I'm going to be pulling late nights like I'm in undergrad again.
---
If shamans are too complex for you button wise I would highly suggest not picking hunter
---
Of course.
---
You also should get a mechanical mouse, a 1024x768 CRT monotor (minimum acceptable weight is 12kg), a Microsoft-Keyboard (PS/2 connected ofc.) with Cigarrette burn marks between the F-keys.
---
After that, all you need to do is contact your phone company, order an ISDN modem, and look up "Win10 PPPoE Configuration" online, and you are all set to go!
---
and searing totem
---
For easiest grouping, probably a healer or a tank.
---
&gt;  edit - Same question about pug raids. Time to set up and run MC/ZG? 
---
PUG raids?! Doubt these will be a thing in early classic. The dedicated people will be pushing with their guilds, most of the rest .. well I wouldn't hold up my hopes.
---
Help my lizard brain out here: Am I right in interpreting this as a further 'buff' to all raid bosses compared to their private server equivalents?
---
Not that I'd play on a private server, I'm a good lad.
---
IMO I'd prefer playing the actual Blizzard stats rather than the best approximation of Blizz stats (Blizzlike stuff).
---
Well.. why wouldnt we have 1.12 talents then? The devs said we were getting the 1.12 game, which includes the 1.12 items, dungeons, raids(eventually), quests, bug fixes, talents, skills, etc. 
---
Are you advocating for having 1.0 talent tree?
---
Instant groups: Warrior Tank
---
Almost instant groups: heal or non-warrior tank
---
At 60 your longer dungeons could take 2 hours. 
---
For raiding I think it's actually a bit easier to get in as a healer. Most raids don't want to PuG main tanks.
---

---
This is a great fuckin map. And I fuckin love maps
---
After mt/ot gets thunderfury it was usually a fury warrior or rogue next in line...there‚Äôs a long wait for that thing.
---
Of someone is coping out at lvl 20 because of "slow leveling", they probably don't have the tamperament to reach 60 with any class honestly.
---
Clickbait.
---
Im pretty sure OP was aware that bows drop in every raid
---
I don't care what you say about servers but THIS DUDE RIGHT HERE has talent.  blizzard needs to get this guy on board.
---
Dungeons themselves don't take more than an hour. Some are much shorter. It's finding a group and getting them all to the entrance that can be frustrating.
---
Thankfully, we now have things like Discord, world chat, and LFG addons that can make it much easier and faster.
---
If you want to be the most valuable and sought after member of a group, I'd say go Warrior and learn to tank (you don't need to level Prot to do this or even be Prot at 60 for dungeons). Druid also makes a good dungeon tank, but Warrior tanking is just more involved and has more options, plus you may find your schedule opening up some times to allow for raids and most guilds won't bother with a Druid tank.
---
If that doesn't suit you, go healer. Priests can heal dungeons specced as shadow pretty easily. Druids, paladins, and shaman have a more difficult time of it, but it's totally fine in their DPS spec if you have a good healing set of gear. For the early dungeons it certainly won't matter at all.
---
And don't discount raiding altogether. Some guilds raid once a week and the days of spending 5+ hours in a raid are done and gone for Classic. A guild of decent players who listen up can easily clear MC or Ony in under an hour, certainly no more than 2.
---
I'd rather say that we who said dungeons actually played RPGs or MMOs before WoW  ^^, Calling Deadmines VC seems like an NA phenomenon I'll never understand.
---
Shamans and paladin get no mana regen from spirit while in combat, unless you don't cast anything for 5 seconds.
---
I believe druid has a talent which let's them get a fraction of their spirit to work while in combat and casting.
---
Will macros follow the modern WoW? seeing as its the BFA client they roll on? I remember macros being a damn pita back then with a programmers degree needed.
---
Don't respec into Blacksmithing. Blacksmithing is for leveling (unless you rush to 60 so fast, that you can't keep up with it).
---
If you want to respect into something for endgame, I'd recommend Engineering instead. Much better for PvP (and useful in a variety of situations really).
---
You don't have to be a coding guy to read a calendar.

Free. Lots of legacy guides.  Addon being ported to classic.
---
Back when vanilla came out I had no idea about the game and I just picked whatever faction/race I felt like. Problem solved.
---
Maybe so. But in my personal experience, Ive never seen a druid tank back then for 5mans.(including TBC). But that may have been simply because I rarely saw druids, and the ones I did see either were cats or healers. 
---
While seeing rogues, voidwalkers, bears(pet), pally, tanking was 'common' simply because people ran with what they had on hand.

---
Damn.. never knew of this, more info?
---
clowning people for the lack of information they have at their disposal is a weirdflex but hey
---
It definitely cuts it back...
---
Yeah, I figured I could just grind a couple world quests each day to unlock the new races that were meant to be the flagstone races of the expansion, but nah.
---
Just requires the rest of the raid to have good dps. If you don't kill bosses fast you're going oom before the fight is over.
---
Im going to play casually (wife, kids and so on) so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be able to raid the big ones anyway. So blacksmith isn‚Äôt really needed for armor/weapons for myself? Thought I could provide myself with stuff and earn on or the other penny with it.
---
I have no issue waiting. And that's the point. By the time I get to raiding I'm assuming the mt/ot will be at least half way in getting such items. So I wouldnt be having to compete with many other players. And if I roll warrior then it's almost an instant jump in the que compared to other classes
---
&gt;I am amazed by most people's ignorance on basic WoW shit. No wonder A LOT of people still think that 14% parry on Bosses in Classic is no big deal...and Druids will be "fine" as Main Tanks in raids.
---
You had two full threads where it was explained in detail how the Parry change will not affect a Druid's ability to raid tank, and it still did not sink in?
---
And yet you think other people are ignorant? And here you make another post where you cant even distinguish between Parry, Dodge and Hit.
---
&gt;But when I eventually get there I'm assuming the hardcore players would have already got most of their desired loot from raids by then
---
I think you severely overestimate the speed of loot progression in Classic.
---
No Ripsnarl in classic
---
&gt; will that up my chances in being able to obtain legendary items such as thunderfury?
---
No. Legendary items are LEGENDARY in Classic. They will be VERY hard to achieve and most guilds will probably have a priority list for their dedicated members who can use it (after getting their MT the first one). So very unlikely you would be high on that list without being part of the guild for a long time and having high raid attendance.
---
For epic gear however, yes. This would be easier to obtain, if you're a little late to the party and the other warriors are already mostly geared.
---
It would help if people ever actually bothered to search for an answer before asking, but they won't.

"the future of classic?"
---
threads we get way to many and they add nothing, lets have a single thread for that discussion
---
noobs asking about race, class, professions im fine with personally
---
Noob question, but how will we add the add ons to classic? Will it be the same as retail ?
---
Back in Vanilla I used to play hunter with a friend who played mage. Hunter / Mage is a very, very good combo in vanilla. 
---
Lots of CC, both ranged, both are good at kiting/slowing, both can nuke. Only thing you need to watch out for is that you don't break eachothers sheeps/traps, then just pick your targets to nuke down and you're good to go!
---
To be fair, stuff like Sit/Enrage (which works on the beta, don't be misinformed) and Hamstring kiting are more modern, advanced tactics and those are the things that really accelerate Warrior leveling.
---
It still sucks compared to classes like Hunters and Mages, but it's realy bad without those tactics.
---
This is how the entire vanilla soundtrack is for me. Elwynn forest during my commute home sheds the stresses of the day
---
in vanilla it was in the WoW folder, then interface&gt;addons
---
Haha, I didn't think of that, but probably many! I imagine back in the day people probably asked me things and I just didn't answer and kept farming!
---
Oh man , so they are going full on for classic then.
---
If you'll be playing casually, then go for it! I'd much more recommend Blacksmithing early on though, especially if you level in a relaxed manner. I make sure to max my current professions before advancing further in leveling, to always equip the best items I can (without grinding dungeons).
---
I just meant that while Blacksmithing has good gear, you will eventually find something better if you play long enough, but Engineering is useful no matter what.
---
Duels are not mechanical intensive in really, they just require tons of keybindings in classic and retail duels are useless anyway.
---
Arena is a lot more mechnically challenging than bgs aswell
---
i picked up a 5$ old joystick guted it and building my own pedals, it even has 6 buttons and 2 analogs i can use!
---
I don't think I know about those either... can you provide some more info?
---
Wow, 41? That is ridiculous. I love it.
---
These are questions no megathread can provide the answers to. The internet is filled with all sorts of guides (both written and videos), but yet everyone feels that their circumstances are special and they need a more personal answer from the community.
---
Also, a LOT of this is very personal and varies from person to person. The info is out there already, people just need to absorb it, contemplate it and make their choice. And then live with it - or reroll and try again.
---
Very cool build was just screwing around with it looks pretty solid

I see. Warriors seem to have a stressful leveling phase. Isn‚Äôt it recommend due to get gold to choose collecting professions till 60? Or will I be able to grind good amount of money for Mount etc?
---
I mean I‚Äôm not sure how many different ways you can say which race is the best for pvp for s certain class but I get your point
---
I wish I had a tactical pregnancy planned so I could get some time off also!

---
thank you so much for your reply. i am at lvl 16 on a rogue now and its so hard compared to a hunter &gt;.&gt; 
---
is there a point that it is just easier?
---
Never-vanilla players have until now never understood Un Goro questing with no flight point...
---
It would just be nice to see discussions that aren‚Äôt the same thing over and over again imo
---
Those of us with mini diablos disagree haha
---
Interview with Icy-Veins I think.
---
The hidden underwater extra boss was also a cool thing.
---
Hm, alright. Warrior is interesting to hear everyone say. I guess my memories of vanilla are that raids were full of hunters and warriors but I guess things change or some people just don't want to tank.
---
I suppose you only run dungeons for so long though so maybe a healer main is more suitable long term? Or is Warrior still in demand assuming I can find a semi-casual guild?
---
Based on the largest polls, only about 7-8% of either faction will be Warriors.
---
Thunderfury won't be available in the game until BWL launches. That's probably 5-8 months after launch.
---
Some guilds went their entire Vanilla career without seeing the Bindings drop. Other guilds were giving them away to Rogues.
---
There's nothing stopping you from becoming a Main Tank for a guild when you do reach 60. Not EVERY player that's ever going to exist in the world is going to be playing right at launch and rushing to 60. Guilds were falling apart and coming together at all points during Vanilla (Naxx 4H requires so many geared tanks that guilds were just poaching from each other).
---
There's also a good chance to become a Main Tank for a guild's alt or auxiliary runs. We're pushing 120 dedicated raiders in our guild discord. If even half of them actually show up to the call, that's still 3 different MC runs a week.
---
The cliffs in Winterspring are wonderful for that as well.  They appear, and then simply drop away.
---
Our locks hated "summon me's" for instances, so we would make it as horrible as possible.  Knowing that one warrior didn't want to run to RFD, we all went to the lift, and summoned him there.  Next "summon me" warrior was summoned in XRoads and made to run like the rest of us.
---
Wow vanilla in a nutshell
---
L
---
Not only this but also, not everyone plays wow on the same day at the same time. For like the first month or so, sure, everyone will be playing ALOT, but after the hype dies down, people will get back into their gaming routines. Some people may only play weekdays and some weekends for example.
---
So stupid, got my post removed by referencing a pserver that was closing soon.
---
Is blizz running this sub? 
---
I know it‚Äôs pride month but the mods can take a little break from choking on blizz dick.
---
More like they were saying some things MIGHT be wrong and worth checking out for blizzard, yeah tons of values turned out to be true but dont forget all the bugs that were found thank to some pservers players.
---
there are 73 members... I think I'll stick with this sub.
---
Thunderfury tends to go to the Tank first in groups. If the Tank already has it or doesn't want it, then every Rogue and Warrior has a chance to get it. You'll be rolling against 20 people I'm sure. You have to imagine only being able to run MC once a week, and how many of those 20+ carry over to next week(along with new raiders) on top of assuming Thunderfury even drops that week. 
---
At the same time, it also depends on what loot system that Guild is using. DKP, or just Need/Greed, etc. If it's DKP, you'll be waiting for a whiiiiile as you probably won't even have the points to buy it.
---
You say WoW Classic but...
---
Why tf is this downvoted/controversial? This is really cool and next level.
---
Back then backpacks where still a lot larger and games much smaller. 
---
So it worked 
---
I did too! I'm super surprised it is on the bottom. I had so much fun gathering the staff peices and then putting it in place above that tiny village.
---
you look like the guy from groundhog day movie
---
Yes. Ashenvale forest for me.
---
How does it change anything?
---
On Private servers you need 9% to cap.
---
In Classic you need 8% but the first hit is ignored, so you still need 9%.
---
Same thing.
---
I ain't no rookie.

I resubbed but it was more because I had been itching to do mount runs again. Got Spawn of Horridon the day I came back lol
---
This is what  Classic is all about. Beautiful.
---
A lot of Alliance justify their decision based on a supposed PVE advantage. I guess finding out that advantage doesn't exist and quite the opposite is true is a giant Crushing Blow.

You've given me hope. Now the choice is human or orc
---
From games I played before WOW, a "dungeon" was an open world cave/mansion etc.
---
Whereas as instance was...exactly that. An instanced part of the game world. Be it a special part of a quest line, town.
---
An instanced dungeon would be defaulted to instance.
---
I've had people try to explain the logic behind calling DM, VC many times and they just can't make it fit.
---
During a Horde raid on the Wetlands, I snuck onto one of the ships, and jumped off onto the side.  Playing my alliance NE hunter, I could meld as I got close to the shore, stay hidden as the boat docked, and then as the boat was pulling away, shoot and HM those left on the docks.  They never found me, and while it took awhile, I would make several round trips.  Twice, I sent pet to get them closer to the boat and within range.  Like a moth to a flame.  :)
---
Seriously, watching someone with Hunter's Mark on them running around is simply worth it.

you know what i wanted the title to say was " **Watch this if you hate retail wow and what it has become otherwise don't**" but my friends convinced me that was a bad title well i guess now im fucked. Some friends huh. Well more hate, couldnt care. Besides me being a fucking retard what else is there? Anything else?
---
I have never liked the dkp system
---
Personally I did great without an RPG mouse. If Macros can be done, that solves a lot of extra clicks on it's own. I think you'd be fine with a normal mouse.
---
Can you attack in ghost wolf form? I honestly can‚Äôt remember, but I feel like you couldn‚Äôt. I may be mistaken though.
---
Are u trying to say asmongold personally banned this person? I don‚Äôt understand the rule broken.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
---
Luckily for me i got the 3 pets free thanks GM &lt;:{|}
---
It's been 12 minutes and I'm still shocked.
---
Razorfen Craul
---
Stubs?
---
It was a joke, I didn't even used macros back in the day lol, was playing a frost mage got away with clicking until halfway through tbc raiding
---
&gt; But, I think the larger context is that they only narrowly avoided a nuclear event that would have made huge chunks of Eastern Europe uninhabitable for generations.
---
Uh, no. Saying that a nuclear reactor can go supercritical and basically turn into a nuclear bomb is like saying that if you shoot a fuel tank in a car, the car will explode.
---
Shit just doesn't work like that on any level.

Imagine defending TrollGodX.
---
Sorry, I was half asleep. Edited original post.
---
I'll probably get to play for a few hours a day cuz I'm an actual useful human and dont play video games all day ;D
---
I was the third shaman to 60 on Kil'Jaeden.  I can tell you right now, unless you are geared, they are weak.  You are going to being playing 2 Handed Elemental build early on. It is good until you get pigeon-holed into Resto for Mail Spell items in MC / Early BWL.  It just can't keep up DPS wise with pure classes.  Same as Ret's.  They turn into heal bitches for the most part.
---
&gt; DW is one of those things that probably isn't viable until WoTLK or whatever.
---
Dual-wield Fury is one of the strongest DPS specs in Vanilla.
---
The reason you got kicked from the group is probably because they expected you to tank.
---
He has Sweeping strikes, so he is specced in Arms. I've seen deep wounds in his stream, too. He is stance dancing, so he likely has some Tactical Mastery. I assume he skilled something like this:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BCNwecQAAA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BCNwecQAAA)
---
This build has the core talents up to level 30 and something to fill the rest.
---
inside job
---
Hopefully you will be collecting and putting together a healing set between 50-60. Also healing crafting gear for starting out is an option.
---
I too plan on chading the first 60 days
---
There are subsets of fans. A sizable amount that wanted a more classic experience were pushed to the side years ago.
---
dunno if you watched the video mate, he's talking about human deviancy not gameplay.
---
&gt;playing CoD series for the multiplayer
---
As a terrible predictive texter I feel you. I mentioned stuns because of the lace specialisation that can auto a stun up to 7% of the time for 3 seconds. But I‚Äôve learnt from the post that most raid mobs can‚Äôt be stunned
---
I really had the same logic on it.  Every time I've come back, since I first quit in Cata, I have felt guilty about it and never really enjoyed myself.  Not this time.
---
Sometimes we will travel far to see that home was right there all along:P
---
I bet the REAL beta for WoW was so much more fun you had NO clue what to do and everything was new when you found it.
---
Trollgodx didn't get banned either so it's all good.
---
What, you forgot to opt in for the beta?
---
Snap
---
Orc. No one will compete with you on Axes. They're far superior in PVP. Horde have dominated nearly every major world first this game has to offer, are much better speedrunners, and lore-wise (at least in Vanilla), Horde are the good guys. Plus, Horde can bring Paladin Blessings into their raids, Alliance cannot bring Shaman Totems into their raids.
---
Why you pretending to be someone else? Your reddit name and Youtube name is the exact same!
---
Just curious, how old are you? Do you have a wife or girlfriend? Kids? Do you never take actual vacations (destinations in real life). 
---
Genuinely curious how/why someone uses all their vacation days to play a video game.
---
If you want to grind a bit of extra gold when levelling, take mining/herb and skinning.
---
Save all the herbs/ores in your bank until you get your level 40 mount then swap to alchemy/engineer.
---
Don't bother with Blacksmith.
---
The money you make from Alchemy will more than cover the BOEs you need to buy for your gear sets.
---
Engineer has so many good items to make that you will use throughout the game in PVP and PVE(Reflectors, Nades, Transporters).
---
No, what you‚Äôre describing is the first amendment. Free speec is literally free speech.
---
I recommend transitioning to resto at 56-58 and healing your way to 60 that way you have some healing gear
---
You have/gather an alternative healing set!
---
Classic is not Retail. So your gear does not change stats when you respec. However, the quest rewards are also not dynamic, but rather have fixed items. So in some cases you will get items that aren't useful for feral, but work on resto. So you'll have to save these.
---
Additionally, you can run your first 5-mans on 60 as feral and roll on leather healer gear (assuming no resto druid in same run, or they don't need the item).
---
Green items with INT etc. are viable!! You can pick them up as you level or from the AH if the price is right.
---
Considering that everyone is pretty under geared at first, healing in feral gear probably won't work out well in level 60 dungeons.
---
Healer is a close second, but up until TBC warrior tanks, especially good ones, are highest demand.
---
Nifty go! Light of elune go!
---
I'm not really a fan either. Plus some leaders can be real communist dicks about it. I can hear the "FIFTY DKP MINUS" guy in the back of my head. I hope I find a seriously awesome guild this time around.
---
Gym can easily take more than 60 minutes....
---
A word about what? They're definitely more engaging than a paladin, have a decent kill speed, 40% move speed at 20, self rez and people love dem windfury procs (I'm more about rockbiter myself though).
---
I knew about the 3 points from playing around on build planners but I thought all the specialisations were that amount. Combining it with blade fury and other attack speed buffs could be interesting.
---
Lol for real. Thank you.
---
What are you talking about? Of course you can.
---
Jesus Christ
---
Technically you're right, but I doubt Blizz would do anything like go after streamers running some one-off promotional thing for one of their sponsors.
---
I think this clause is more targeted at some actual business like MLG setting up an ongoing for-profit gaming system within their game.
---
FUCK YEAH.
---
Definitely don‚Äôt have a real job
---
I‚Äôve never really been an optimizer on feat paths. What would the threes look like?
---
It annoys me that they keep introducing new ones rather than doing anything with the ones they have. Since Azeroth was one big continent before the sundering, why does there have to be new races on every new landmass?
---
I was too young at the time to really understand any of it first time round. But yeah I agree I hope I find some decent people and not some try hard a holes
---
Resub, get into beta, char gets deleted in 2 months. OCD level over 9000.
---
Great, thanks a lot!
---
Interesting. I have simmilar experience with playing Stellaris, it happend to me multiple times that my heartbeat slowed down so much that my fitness tracker started logging sleep time
---
Nope. Very low drop rate, and every hunter wants it. 90% of hunters will raid AQ with MC bow.
---
stop using this sub to promote your shitty youtube channel
---
wish the mods would actually enforce their rules
---
And then an energy drink to keep going lol,
---
Live to win!
---
For me it was Eric Clapton's MTV unplugged album. If I listen to 'Alberta' today I'm in Zangarmarsh leveling my 62 Rogue after TBC release.
---
Following that retarded logic then a 5 man dungeon group will be consisting of:
---
1 - Prot Warrior
---
1 - Healer  
---
3 -  DPS being ONLY either Affliction/Desctruction Warlock, Fire Mage, Shadow Priest or Elemental Shaman, as ALL OTHER DPS SPECCS are lower dps...
---
Retri with concecration will most of the time outdps any rouge specc in a aoe heavy fight....does that mean that we should just nix rouges from pve groups entierly, or look at what utility they bring to the table as well?
---
Give up on thunder fury as a casual player. It‚Äôs not going to happen
---
I'll be with my cousin in stonetalon mountain on top fo the tent nuking people from a safe distance lolzz its gonna be glorious.
---
Why Dire maul of course
---
There's obviously going to be some gap there in gear, as your primary goal leveling is going to be leveling more efficiently.
---
Having leveled healers in the past, you really have to depend on the gear you pick up along the way to help you out initially. If a quest reward is a small upgrade to your feral set, dont be afraid to grab a cloth piece for healing or something like that. As you level, you'll likely keep two sets of gear anyway, so just keep it updated and you wont be too far behind.
---
Pre-Raid Best in Slot gear has many drops from BRD, which is a bit easier to heal than say LBRS/Strat/Scholo, so I would recommend running BRD a few times to get your stuff out of there first, and plan to build out your gear from those runs before stepping into the tougher level 60 dungeons.
---
your english and grammar is better than mine and it‚Äôs my first and only language...
---
I get a weird feeling it'll be a lot more relaxed this time around. My body is ready.
---
Let me know what you think of episode 4...
---
Well, internet wasn't as united at that time so I guess both Dungeon and Instance is correct term depending on what gaming community you belonged to! :) 
---
Van Cleef.. Yeah but you do all other bosses =(
---
You can get 4 meals from HelloFresh, the first week they'll give you $40 off. They take 20-40min to cook. Everything you need comes except a pan, olive oil, salt, pepper.

Not pictured : krondogg and the bluntlogic allstars
---
Was always bummed there wasn‚Äôt a sick totem weapon for shamans :(
---
Personally i think no. I never found megathreads that useful tbh.
---
I'm doing some highschool courses so I can go back to school in January but I need to have them done by November and the job I'm at now..I don't have the time to get 3 done by November...so my sound logic is put in 2 weeks on August 12th, so I'll be done on the 26th and then I'll have ample time to get my courses done, grind to 60 and raid and time for a part time job.
---
Is it crazy?
---
Haha that‚Äôs kinda the train of thought I had really. It‚Äôs going to be like the Wild West again going back in and I figured if I took the road less travelled then competition wouldn‚Äôt be that much of an issue.
---
I resubbed early just for the off chance, but I also wanted to send a message to Blizzard. I resubbed so that I could be ready to play Classic the moment it drops and I won't spend a single millisecond playing BFA. Not one daily, not one level... nothing. That says that I would rather pay just for the slim chance at Classic and won't even waste my time with BFA. Maybe they don't care and are just happy to take my money, but my intent is clear.
---
Sooo - having more layers does affect the AH?
---
I might have been lost on the way please correct me if I¬¥m wrong.
---
Does that matter at all? :d
---
As Long as you can't abuse it by changing layers constantly a single Player won't Profit much from it will he?
---
The acution house also won't be flooded because it is simply like 4 Servers in one. 4x the demand and 4x the supply.
---
I honestly don't see the Problem but as I said - I might be blind regarding this right now :D
---
Please enlighten me :)
---
i wish there was a secondary classic wow subreddit for all these blogposts and self-help posts
---
Classic incel line. I love you

Try to play Fury Warrior with that mindset then ;-)

On the podcast they said actors "acted" a Russian accent rather than speaking like a normal person, so they just let people speak their "mother tongue" as it were, ie english.

Strat and scholo are 5 man, lbrs is 5 man, only ubrs is 10 man (in 1.12)
---
What‚Äôs the difference between horde and alliance players in terms of tools?
---
I'm not trying to be mean I'm genuinely interested....what made dire maul so good for you? My experience with dire maul is that it was fun like a mini raid but it was too big and the pace was too slow.
---
They already said that they will offer free Server Transfers in that case. 
---
And People will take those Transfers when the Queue is 2-3hrs +
---
I got a free day from the GM thag helped me recover my old account until i got my new card in the mail today and i was going to resub, but highly doubtful now, i actually was going to play this game some to but its so different now i just said fuck it until Classic drops.
---
*Laughs in private servers*
---
This is the joy if taking 2 weeks off from work to hit max level faster then anyone else. The true mmo experience.
---
Getting the tank gear in the first place is what I'm talking about
---
Great explanation. Hopefully this time ppl get it
---
Or be a streamer. They let quite a free streamers in that have never played wow.
---
Yeah, but you're not paying 15 a month for a souls game. And, also, they're not really catering to the instant gratification crowd, they're catering to the people who have played the game, unlocked many of the travel options and are trying to fit WoW into their work/life/family/etc. balance because they like the game. Walking the same route in game for the 700th time really doesn't give either satisfaction or anything else for that matter, it's just travel time
---
What do you mean? They are english actors speaking english on an english created show.
---
And he's just the cook now.
---
There's no reason to use Titanpanel. It's also a HUGE resource hog usually using 100mb+ of memory.
---
If only they gave you a terror effect spell...
---
Hunters and warriors should really get a swing timer.
---
A little off? LOL, that‚Äôs a first for me.
---
Yeh, this is why I think at around MoP, without actually agreeing on it. Everyone switched to "dungeon" xD
---
The other thing they tried to push was that DM was Dire Maul, but the counter to that is that DM is a prefix for Dire Maul, you then require N,W,E to follow.
---
This is the only thing that I'll still question when it's put in chat in game.
---
It actually feels awful being a healer dur to batching and I imagine a LOT of people are going to complain on the release of classic.
---
After you heal someone, their health wont update until pretty much a full half second after your spell completes, it feels awful and completely unresponsive.
---
Added clunkiness is the biggest meme in gaming at the minute and I fucking hate it with a passion.
---
It's always worth it.
---
We are all just assuming here... That does not lead to anything :d
---
I'd say Drops will be layer wide too.
---
But since AH is Server wide this won't matter?!
---
4x the Drops but also 4x the amount of People looking for specific items...
---
I guess that struck a nerve. Why reply to a guy who isn't even talking about ToS then?
---
You'll be fine
---
PVE raid, when looking at what classes and specs to bring focus waaaaay to much on pure dps output compared to overall utility. Yes, hunters have bad dps compared to other classes, but try doing Magmadar in MC wo one. 
---
Sure rogues are not the dop DPS class in raids, but the utility they can bring in places like AQ20 or ZG is highly welcome.
---
My point being, yes, a retri pala on a fight like  Vaelastrasz the Currupt in BWL which is a pure DPS check is bonkers, but flat out ignoring them for the entire content of vanilla raiding is stupid, as yes, their dps  is lowpar (still higher than the tank in most cases), but they still bring things like cleansing, buffing, auras and offhealing to the table...
---

---
Gnomeregan.
---
Yes, I know, the dungeon is crap when compared to the rest of them. It's a maze, it's confusing, it has some annoying trash and all sorts of nonsense, but it felt like a fleshed out dungeon for the early levels. 
---
When I first played Vanilla WoW, I was a dwarf hunter. I was terrible. I would use distracting shot thinking it did damage, even in PvP. I used a spider for a pet and wonder why it died when I tried to get it to tank. I leveled slow, died a lot, and was probably dead weight in dungeons. I cleared Deadmines, but it was a pretty bad experience, so I avoided dungeons for a while. 
---
When the time came to run Gnomer, I was amazed that [Triprunner Dungarees](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9624) was a quest reward, so I had to do it. I spent who knows how long forming a group, leveled my weapon skills as I waited and got my group to the dungeon. 
---
We were slow to clear the dungeon, it probably took 3+ hours. We died a lot to the Dark Iron dwarves who dropped landmines on the way to Thermaplugg. I wasn't getting any loot until we noticed that the [Dark Iron Ambassador](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=6228) had spawned. Nobody in the group realized that rare spawns in dungeons were a thing. We cleared our trash to get to him, and he went down easy. He dropped [Glass Shooter](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9456) which was absolutey huge for me, and I got it with no competition. That gun lasted me for quite  a while.
---
I still remember this run after 14 years, and that blows my mind. I won't be running a Hunter this time around, but I want to kill the Dark Iron Ambassador again and make another Hunter happy with a lucky dice roll. That'd be sweet.
---
... I also want to run BRD. I won't lie.
---
on a full minute cd
---
As much as I love Vanilla, and Teldrassil/Ashenvale/Ironforge being my favorite songs, I can't help but love Grizzly Hills and Wintergrasp music...those triangle sounds, hnnng
---
Getting your party on the same page with the quests seems way harder than actually doing them lol
---
What did Asmongold do? I thought it was Tipsout that organized the dueling tournament
---
Found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point. Imagine defending the receding hairline.
---
If you look closely you can see a sad benched Feral Druid sitting in the bottomright corner.
---
That‚Äôs instantly stopped by will of forsaken. Then has diminishing returns, and then the trinkets can stop it, and then at this point you‚Äôve wasted so much time trying to fear that you‚Äôve done minimal damage, and finally you get a kek while your ass is spread like butter by the undead rogue.
---
Planning ahead
---
If Alliance and people LFG VC. Just ask them in PM why they'd do Wailing Caverns (yeah yeah W instead of V but still) and if they'd rather do DM with you :D
---
I only discovered this a few weeks ago so rip my chance.
---
What in the world does this mean haha.  You will be fine
---
Also guilty, though I have been playing some on BfA. I don't anticipate that lasting very long but it's fun for now.
---
I believe ehe pet always started with the left most ability that was on autocast, and not on cool down, that it had the energy to perform, that was valid.  You had to put bite before claw otherwise it would claw first and never be able to bite.
---
But it's been  a long time, and many expansions.. so I could be wrong.
---
You'll be able to gear much faster as an alliance lock, but you'll have a disadvantage in most PvP scenarios.
---
&gt;I think this clause is more targeted at some actual business like MLG setting up an ongoing for-profit gaming system within their game.
---
like betting on pvp battles?

About Us:
---
&lt;Quidi Vidi&gt; is a group of vanilla players returning to the game in anticipation for WoW: Classic. We are looking for like-minded people to level and enjoy the game with. Our goal is to complete some raid content in retail before moving on to WoW: Classic leveling and raiding upon release. Our core player base is in the maratimes but we are open to all Canadians and more. 
---
--------------------------------------------------- 
---
Guild Goals:
---
-Develop a core team to enjoy classic leveling / raiding with. Our primary goal is having fun with the game.
---
-Complete some raid content! We are hoping we can complete some retail content before moving on to leveling together and ultimately raiding in Classic.
---
-Most people would like to maintain their social lives if they choose to be a part of this guild. I expect most players will be somewhat casual at least. A core group of us would like to push ourselves a little further.
---
Our group is composed of previous players with mixed experience levels in raiding and content. Some of the players will not be joining us until the guild moves into classic.
---
We expect members who want to be a part of our group to:
---
1) (MOST IMPORTANTLY) Be relaxed about crude humor - we love to joke around in discord and some may consider us insensitive at times.
---
2) Represent our guild as one that has respect for other players. These servers will be communities in themselves and anyone giving us a bad name in these communities will be removed.
---
3) Show up to Guild activities that they have previously agreed to.
---
4) Be able to use discord &amp; microphones for guild activities. We want to get to know you and have fun joking around in discord :)
---
5) Be understanding that a lot of our members have jobs and social lives. We choose to have some players around who are more casual than we are because we enjoy their company. 
---
6) Be 19+ please. We are all 27 - 30.
---
7) Be willing to play on a schedule that falls between NDT (Newfoundland Time / UTC -2:30) and MST (Mountain Standard Time / UTC-07)
---
8) Must be willing to bring flasks / food items to raids where progression is important.
---
9) Must be 420 / Alcohol friendly - Although the guild is not themed around either, some guild members choose to legally partake in cannabis / alcohol in their relaxation time.
---
Bonus points if people have experience in Retail or Classic raiding. Our core group will certainly need a hand getting started!
---
I'm pretty sure I can easily convince people that they'll get more loot in the long run though, so following the system would be in their best interest long term. Also, even if I just had to trust my fellow raiders, I'd take that bet, but it might be that I have more trust in them than you do.
---
Most of these were not in classic.
---
Exactly. Asmongold did not even do his yet.
---
If you like raiding then you'll have a good time because alliance warlocks aren't insanely common.
---
in awe at this absolute unit
---
Well, this backfired significantly.
---
You can't let the perks of the opposite faction stop you from playing what you want. It's kind of like saying, "Is it worth playing a Horde caster for raiding because Gnomes get more intellect"?
---
Don't forget a week later monday is labor day too, get that week off and have an extra day too!
---
Hmm, average lvl1 to 60 time is about 240 hours. There is 168 hours in a week, without sleep. Good luck my dude.
---
Isn‚Äôt warlock orc the best race?
---
You don't need a guide, what looks more interesting to you, pick that one.
---
It's not something I'd do, but you need to do what you want
---
I dont remember abilities being prioritized either, I remember it as whichever came off CD if focus was available would be used, leading to 0 focus constantly if you had claw on.
---
What is in the beta currently that I really feel was not there back then is the same 1-2 second delay on pet autocasts that retail WoW has had since Legion(maybe earlier?) leading you to have to macro /cast claw /cast bite into every ability you use if you truly want it used off CD
---
I said that once and was downvoted into oblivion
---
I started playing in BC when everyone trying to do BRD was leveling in the low 50s. I remember it being so hard. On classic I think it‚Äôll be mostly high 50s/60 so it‚Äôll be pretty easy generally.
---
I haven't taken any holidays this year so taken 2 weeks off. Hopefully get to 60 in the first week!
---
If you aren't the MT of your guild then getting tfury is a hail mary.
---
I work for a financial services firm in Michigan, I get 2 weeks, then can use banked PTO from previous years as leave time. Taking 5 weeks when my boy is born in early September.
---
Your layer is supposed to be "sticky",
---
And the game tries to put you in the same layer as your friends list and guild list.
---
So you need an invite from someone in a different layer to "hop" layers.
---
However layering isn't working as intended yet.
---
&gt; 3 - DPS being ONLY either Affliction/Desctruction Warlock, Fire Mage, Shadow Priest or Elemental Shaman, as ALL OTHER DPS SPECCS are lower dps...
---
War fury - mage fire or frost depends of the tier - wl - rogue - sp.
---
I'm so confused as to why lots of folks panic about WotF. Sure it's nice, but it has a CD and can be baited.
---
You just have to get the jump and not rely on fears. You‚Äôll be fine.
---
Truthfully, I‚Äôm rolling horde lock ;)
---
DM could stand for either Deadmines or Dire Maul. Most times people would say VC to differentiate between the two for convenience sake (for example: someone wanting to do Dire Maul responds to a LFG in /2 and then finds himself in a party of level 18s). The VC stands for Van'Cleef.
---
There is nothing wrong with a PvE server. You may notice the population being in the more casual focused side because of time constraints, but there won't be a lack of Guilds and "not-off" people.
---
Also, since BGs will be cross-realm, you won't have to worry about a dead BG server.
---
Pessimist
---
I mean how much would you Pay for Madden?
---
&gt; You could consider it the only legendary mount in the game, because getting it has nothing to do with luck.     
---
 - Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal     
---
 - [War] mounts (e.g. Reins of the Black War Tiger, Black War Kodo, Black War Ram, etc etc).    
---
If anything the Black Qiraji is the only "legendary" mount in classic. There's one per realm. Most people will never even see it. But the war mounts (PvP Rank 11) are also a difficult grind.
---
I think in a loot council system it would create to many issues to start dishing out offspec items to PvPers. I'm just imagining how handing out something like talisman to a healing priest would sit with the mages in the raid that have to do MC for months to see it. It just doesn't make sense.
---
I think as a PvPer looking to gear through raids they should be looking to join a guild with a dkp system, or just accept that your PvP spec isn't going to take prio. Alternatively they could find a guild that would allow them to raid as a damage spec if they are typically a healer or something. 
---
I think alot of raids would be open to taking a few meme raid specs like ret / spriest.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

If you want to spend your life in PVP having everything you apply to the enemy dispelled, roll Horde.
---
People short-sightedly believe Alliance Warlocks have it rough with WotF. They have NO idea what it's like to come across even just a semi decent Paladin in WPvP.
---
I initially stopped playing Horde due to the aesthetics of the zones and towns. So dull and boring when compared to Alliance zones.
---
Ok
---
What? There's a Print+Screen button on your keyboard?
---
Fuck em bro. If you‚Äôre really good you‚Äôll only lose to really good players in 1v1. You can always fake fear and try to get them to blow wotf. Remember too that your hooker pet can banish people and buy you more time. If they‚Äôre anticipating the fear cast but it‚Äôs a fake the noobs will just blow their shit and now you got max return for your fears. Honestly who gives a fuck if it‚Äôll be slightly harder against upper tier players go be a warlock and kick some teeth in.
---
Whoa bro, what about those fat cats making millions on the peacebloom market?
---
At your side, m'lady! *tips fedora*
---
I'm off that Tues/Wed. I then work Thurs/Fri, and then I'm off again from Sat-Thurs.
---
So, not as hardcore as the 2 full weeks some are taking off, but pretty non-casual nonetheless.
---
This is one of those places I know like the back of my hand, and really isn‚Äôt that super complicated to navigate if you play attention for a couple of runs in the  :p
---
Considering I ran MC ~80% of the total resets in vanilla wow from beta to tbc and saw 3 TFs get made in my two guilds, I would say it is safe to assume you will never get it.  Good luck though!
---
The gms should have teleported him to
---
Ungoro and removed his hearthstone.
---
You mean Troll Priest named Bob, thank you
---
^(it will be mine)
---
Honestly hunters are the most self sufficent class in vanilla apart from dudus so you can really pair them up with lots of things. I'd say dudu or spriest tho.
---
Shadowfang Keep. I never forget my first time successfully completing the dungeon. It was a true adventure, battling through Arugal's minions and finally confront the mage himself. This is impressive considering I could barely read English back then, but I knew Arugal was the big bad because I recognize his name, so I was like very hyped when we finally confronted him.
---
Found the illiterate. You can be opposed yo both Asmongold and TrollgodX.
---
Bro fuck those trolls ruining the dueling tournament.  They should have been account banned for all I care.
---
&gt; Found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point.
---
Nice
---
That‚Äôs pretty neat
---
Thanks for sharing man
---
So you're planning on taking like 2-3 years or more? Ok cool. By then people will be leveling and gearing alts, not just clearing old trash on their main... So you're still starting at the back of the line.
---
&gt;And if I roll warrior then it's almost an instant jump in the que compared to other classes
---
Yeah, if you are geared, which if you're leveling late: you aren't. Tons of people play warr. You won't be special.
---
Ah prices tend to be cheaper but lvl 60 is quite boring as theres no fear of getting ganked and you cant kick the opposite faction out of your farming spots the world doesnt feel as alive imo.
---
C'mon man.  If you *really* dicked it up between now and August, the wife would leave you, with the kids, and you'd have more WoW time, permanently.  You're thinking is too small.
---
Human. No one will compete with you on Swords (once you get TF, it will only makes you that much stronger than other races). They're far superior in PvE in general and are on a stronger side in PvP thanks to having paladins in BGs. Alliance brings you good looking zones, cities and races, and who cares about every major world first. Speedrunning is a thing in Alliance as well, in fact its a 15y old game, so logically content can be cleared with ease, however ally is much better lore-wise (throughout all the Vanilla and expansions). Ally are the good looking guys. Plus, Alliance has the real paladins in raids and dont really need opposite faction classes
---
I said terror effect, not fear. As in death coil.
---
Also, git gud.
---
And?
---
Blessing of Salvation which reduces your threat output by 30%.
---
The Shaman equivalent of Blessing of Salvation is Tranquil Air totem which reduces threat by 20% but it doesn't get used in melee groups because both Windfury totem and Grace of Air totem are both Air totem types which means only one kind of air totems can be active at a time.
---
You're probably familiar with the totem mechanic already but Fire, Earth, Water and Air are types of totems and only one of each type can be active at a time. So you can put down flametongue totem and grace of air totem at the same time for example, but you can't put flametongue totem and magma totem at the same time since they're both fire type totems.
---
Anyway, Tranquil Air totem doesn't get used in melee groups because Shamans are busy swapping back and forth between Windfury totem and Grace of Air totem.  
---
Tranquil Air totem does get used in caster groups though.
---
Well, aren't you a little off OP?
---
I'll be wanding those things as well as the healer, if you try to melee you'll get a res afterwards.
---
I used to do arena in TBC and premade BG's in vanilla - sometimes the range on warstomp can seem deceptive. The size of the tauren hurt/hitbox is definitely a factor here - the larger the diameter on the hurt/hitbox, the larger the diameter on any PBAOEs.
---
ConsolePort
---
Good point.
---
Remember to light all the candles at the same time!
---
Yeah Im leveling a druid on a private server right now and the versatility is pretty fun. My only complaints are that I often can't see my armor because of shapeshifting and my favorite race to play is dwarf. But it's definitely a possibility!
---
27th - 3rd
---
Gnome was a very unique and fun dungeon it was always something fun and new and fresh to go in there.
---
You should probably be maintaining a healing set starting in the 20s. Just keep any random leather you find with +int on it, and upgrade it as you go alongside your main set. It will be shitty at 60 but it is a starting point and it will let you farm dungeons to get your prebis.
---
The +healing mace from SM is a great grab, consider farming for it as you pass through that level range.
---
imagine not comprehending an obvious joke
---
I think people are forgetting that Blizzard has a team fully trained for only making trailers.
---
Pve servers are great. Remember bed time is at 8, and the binky and blankey are on the side table before thrall comes to tuck you in.
---
Thing is most of your gear are the same gear what others use as ret or in warriors case as fury. Unlike other expansions in vanilla putting all the +def/block/armor items will NOT work because you won't have sufficent amount of rage and threat to hold aggro (hence why fury tanks are common in raids). Just put anything with stam/int/agi and pray for rng gods.
---
Mad because he's not in beta, but thinks he deserves it due to some false sense of entitlement.
---
It's not like Blizzard is losing money because of this. If anything it's good publicity to show off Community involvement in Classic. 
---
Plus, it's Beta. What are they going to do, ban someone from Beta for hosting a Dueling Tournament?
---
People need to get their thumbs out of their bums and accept that Streamers are not going away, whether they get special treatment or not.
---
I have seen that claim repeated enough times now I think it will happen.
---
Take all this Information with a grain of salt because I skipped through that part pretty quick because I didn't care too much :P
---
Riding will be in it's pre 1.12. state (I don't know when exactly it was changed)
---
Meaning that riding will be cheap and the mount will be expensive. Unlike it used to be at 1.12. where riding was expensive and mounts cheap.
---
The reason for that is that they kept the "Racial riding skill" meaning that Tauren will learn Kodo-Riding, Gnomes learn Mechanostrider-Riding etc.
---
There were restrictions as well. For example Tauren could only ride Kodos and Wolfs in Vanilla. The undead and troll Mounts just didn't exist for them unless they got lucky with Drops in ZG or Strath...
---
There are a couple more restrictions I think... IIRC Mechanostriders could only be ridden by Gnomes and Dwarfs but as I said - take this with a grain of salt I¬¥m not really 100% sure of the restrictions :)
---
Are you fucking serious, now you're blaming your "friends"? Jesus christ dude, how stupid do you think we are? Just delete your account already, you've invalidated yourself ten times over.
---
Fucking lol, the shitposts here get better and better.
---
I sincerely hope that's a happy memory.
---
It only stops fear effect, death coil is horror/terrify effect
---
Feels extra special when playing a dwarf (hunter),  great rp feel and if you get the spear and gun you‚Äôre set for a good minute.
---
He played before that, and I wouldn't say classic was a hot new thing directly after the announcement. Wanting to make money is one thing, but why is it so difficult to believe people are passionate about the game, too?
---
There were no commercial or nonprofit entities involved.
---
Dude rogues don‚Äôt even have blind at 30.
---
This post contributes to the community
---
Yeah. I remember having addons in the beta, even. Maybe some alpha players played WoW before addons, but even then I bet half the alpha players were devs who made addons right away.
---
I‚Äôm guilty as well but I am using my month to farm gold so I can continue to play for free in August
---
Only draw back to that is I kinda like them.... good back up plan though

As to being subscribed - it is binary.  You either are, are you are not.
---
If you do not wish to stay subscribed at the moment, I certainly  would not encourage that for the slim chance at being chosen to partake  in the very limited beta.
---
Not our lumber!!
---
Realist!!!!
---
Blizz will ban guilds who exploit the blessings tactic bud, but I say orc as well for all other reasons
---
As someone who has always played on PvE servers since Vanilla, what do you mean by 'a little off'?
---
Theres still hardcore and semi-hardcore raiding guilds, there's more casual guilds and you run into more beginners. I also personally believe it attracts a slightly older crowd who simply want to play and get shit done without having to worry about being ganked.
---
Pick whatever you like best. I'm rolling a horde priest but should I pick undead because of WOTF as I am going to pvp a lot? Probably. But I like trolls so I'm going troll.
---
If you build it, they will come.
---
I have actually tried HelloFresh before lol, and while I liked most of the meals, I wasn't always that convinced of the freshness of the ingredients as proclaimed (although I understand that the delivery process ultimately does take its toll on things). I might actually raid my local supermarket for ingredients for some nice veggie curries that you can prepare in advance and that heat well in the microwave, or I might actually order take out lol. I guess a good combination of those things is where I'll end up with. And the odd bag of doritos/chips, who am I kidding.......
---
It's Salman. You gotta practice your indian memetics
---
Energy ticker and combo bar. There are updates by "nug". Everyone forgets that rogue and druid are dependent on energy ticking up by 20 every 2 sec.
---
The add-on is small, and if you're a rogue or cat druid, you'll want to put near the center of your screen so you can focus your target and still know when the energy will tick. On starting encounters, you will generally open right before energy ticks, which seems small, but it's 20 free energy. Life or death in PvP many times.
---
I feel bad but every time I see a new post that says "I'm new to wow, is classic where I should start?" kinda thread I just get annoyed because it feels like every day there is a new one. I want new players but come on people, just search.
---
&gt; Also, git gud.
---
Please stay in bfa, classic don't need people like you in his community.
---
Thottbot ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Thanks for letting us know
---
Druid works very well, because at 22 if they go feral they can have the cat swiftness talent that gives them a 30% movement speed while in cat and then they get Travel form at 40 so they can run faster than the hunter. It is a really over powered combo in pvp because they hunter can be bait while the druid lurks in the shadows. It is essentially the faster combo to priest/rogue.
---
You leave our trees alone!
---
Okcool
---
I would say the more reasonable approach would be to port him to another part of the world, if it continues, suspenion for a few days. If repeated offences, just for the sake of griefing other players, ban.
---
I am off until the following tuesday morning
---
How do you kill rag week 1 when you need to dowse the runes?
---
Omg.. Please stop.
---
Don't forget that the Monday after launch is Labor Day, free day off for us US folks. I personally am only taking 4 days off. I have a ton of PTO, but having a toddler, I can't use it all incase he gets sick :-/. 
---
But I do Work from Home so I can usually squeeze a few hours during work hours to "work"
---
Agreed. The warrior feeds of damage and doesn‚Äôt rely on mana. It‚Äôs the best with pocket heals by a mile.
---
I‚Äôm in for no changes, but God, I‚Äôd also love to see a special Chromie easter egg questline just for the Classic WoW.
---
I wanted to roll a rogue but then i thought a lot of people will and raid spots will be hard to find. Then there is lock who will be the favorite target of every rogue and warrior util almost contentul full bwl gear. Then comes the part where the warlock will become immortal in most cases.
---
Everyone in the work knows that Im waiting for Classic badly long time and when its will be realised. Feels embarrassing now to take off,cos of game, had to just stay silent about Classic:d
---
Only thing I've taken from this thread is a way for people to brag about going to the gym....
---
Simply put, alliance are for the pretentious ass holes who are the embodiment of everything scum worthy. Then horde are the underlying scabs of the world, with no honor or intelligence above attacking anything that moves. Hope this helps
---
P.S. I'm not a super hardcore player, nor am I a casual. I'm somewhere inbetween.
---
"kinda".  And how much do you love WoW?  Your priorities are all messed up.
---
Can't wait
---
That's odd. Mine is sitting next to me and the box is brown, not black.

Dear diary
---
Nope! Not saying that. The explosions/spread of nuclear material after the fact wouldn't have been "nuclear bomb" like - rather, they would have been more traditional - steam, pressure, fires that can't be extinguished - with the added fun detail that all of the material being expelled was EXTREMELY irradiated. Just a couple days after the initial explosion, radiation alarms were already going off in labs as far away as Sweden and Germany. If allowed to keep burning, or if further explosions occurred during the meltdown, or if the meltdown reached the ground water, it would have spread even more (potentially MUCH more) of the nuclear material into the surrounding area. Not "Fallout super mutant nuclear wasteland", sure, but "you can't eat any food grown in Ukraine, Belarus, or Eastern Poland or drink the water without significant cancer risk".
---
Time to rediscover Gnomer!  :)
---
But don't worry, even as an Alliance and joining two or three Alliance groups -- they didn't know the entire instance, either.  I was just grateful that the little mine dwarves had been nurfed.  :)
---
so the problem is that retail community is too large...
---
!RemindMe 6 Days
---
It‚Äôs nice actually increasing your damage with gear instead of spell ranks because spell damage is scarce. That being said until 60 on most casters you‚Äôre fine as long as you don‚Äôt run oom.
---
Nah mid 50s brd wipes are going to be common again.
---
I get what you are saying but it's a beta how are they suppose to outcast someone who is too scared to troll on main and makes a fake name level 1 for attention
---
I dot and wand 'em -- and try to stay far ahead of them leaving my group between me and them.  I just wish the originals were back, I really, really do.  Those and the little worms coming out of the pump.  Yeah, those suckers hurt, and in killing the flora heading up the ramp -- man, those things had an aggro radius of 3 miles, I swear. :)
---
I fully intend to listen to the same music that I listened to for a majority of vanilla. I also had 5 discs on repeat. 
---
Many of the songs immediately bring me back. They don't necessarily make me feel happy, but they make me feel at ease. I was at a very low point emotionally back then. WoW really helped me through it.

you have ridiculously high expectations , considering we already know everything there is to be in classic and there's nothing remotely challenging enough for even just an heroic guild...
---
Jokes on them. I'm not subbed, have beta, AND can still play
---
It's "Stromgarde Keep".
---
You've got "Stormgarde".
---
oh, a comment from a mod? 
---
I think we are talking about the official beta announcement ( https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/22990080 ) :
---
"To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
Not correcting you because I have never played classic, but aren't rets really good in PvP?
---
Who gives a shit
---
holy moly I had no idea! Thanks for the info man that'll be a big factor in what race I choose now!
---
The Clean Area with the grime scrubbing machines was a fun addition. There was a bit of a mystery about the [Grime-Encrusted Object](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9308)s you collected throughout the dungeon. Being able to take them and play the slots for a few minutes as a late-dungeon reprieve was a neat addition. It was also cool to see friendly mobs in a dungeon as Alliance.
---
The rewards from the [Sparklematic-Wrapped Box](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9363) were pretty bad if you weren't a miner + blacksmith/engineer (I was an engineer, so I didn't mind), but there was a ~1% chance that you'd get a ring or neck for each box you made. At that level, chances were that you didn't have those slots filled, so it was a nice side-reward even if you rolled terrible stats on them.
---
Doesnt solve the issue with hoarding DKP, which will hurt progression

Uhh it was my cat and not me blanking on the name of the axe at all

As a romanian  what should I do?!?! :))))
---
You should ask yourself if BS is really necessary for you and it is what you want to have. I will go warrior and I have come to conclusion, that any item I will ever need from BS can be bought in AH, therefore I will rather make a profession, that will actually make me money
---
I was gonna say, losing ten pounds would be super easy, barely an inconvenience. Few bags of crisps would do that.
---
What the heck do people want in a classic beta? It's not a new, unseen game for god's sake? It's a 14 year old game being relaunched. 
---
Save your energy for the real launch, the grind will be painful enough
---
One word:  Triprunner Dungarees  :)
---
I played actual classic gtfo catakid I thought he said fear. Go back to your inaccurate private server so you can feel like you almost killed real Rag plebeian
---
"Classic is about community"
---
"Classic is about helping others while you gain nothing"
---
"We need to do everything to make Classic happen" 
---
**But don't you fucking dare asking a question someone else already asked.** 
---
No. 
---
We should embrace every question as a potential new member of the classic community.
---
I'll start playing on the first of September, cuz of reasons, and get a full day in. Then probably like 2hrs a night after work.
---
UD Stratholm will always have a special place in my memory. 
---
A group of friends were doing a late night live Stratholm run for Righteous Orbs and a quest. When we were done we decided to say fuck it and do UD side after. We killed one boss on the UD side and got a system message that the server was shutting down for maintenance in 30 minutes. We went as fast as possible to finish and made it with like 3 minutes left. It was incredibly nail biting.
---
Those are addons for private servers (WoW 1.12.1 usually) and not the ones available in Classic, a lot of them still exist, though
---
Wrong link?
---
I said uldaman because like many of the vanilla dungeons the uniqueness of it was just so fantastic. Its difficulty scaling throughout the dungeon was good, the story was really good if youre into that, and the mechanics of the bosses were one of the first more difficult mechanics you got. Plus the enchanting trainer haha, but really I dont know why but lately that is the dungeon ive been most excited about, I mean of course old dm, old bfd, and of course brd, but for some reason I feel like uldaman is just under appreciated in its complexity for a lower level dungeon.
---
TL:DR Uldaman under appreciated imo.
---
I mean he can make a new character no?
---
Thanks for the comments guys. Decided I will roll a warrior. Still havnt decided what faction but I guess I will just roll as whatever my friends go as :)
---
Better location. Probably doing way more business now.
---
While your delivery leaves meeting to be desired, your point still stands.
---
So original
---
What you're referring to is time value of money. It's used to simply discount cashflow. It's more dependent on purchasing power in real terms.
---
Since many needs in classic don't inflate (epic mount, respec, repairs) this isn't entirely true.
---
Are people really opening tickets complaining about not getting into the beta
---
&lt;Nebula&gt; (EU Alliance)
---
Nebula began as a small group of friends, some of who have lived the vanilla experience given to us in 2004, some of us haven‚Äôt. Some of us hardcore, some are not.
---
Yet the main goal for all of us is the same. This is a game we are super excited about launch and simply put can‚Äôt wait for the fun times ahead. We are a group of adults, 
---
from each corner of Europe. We love banter and a good atmosphere.
---
Guild reputation is important to us. So, weather your jam is smashing skulls in AV, grinding Timbermaw rep or competing with us in end game content, Nebula would be happy to host your stay. 
---
Our philosophy is: For the guild, not a person.
---
Straight up raiding. Our ranks include many highly experienced players who have spent 14 years raiding on wow. Our raiding environment will be serious, yet positive and enthusiastic. 
---
If raiding isn‚Äôt your jam, our ranks also include many socials/ pvpers who are here for ride! 
---
Raid Times:
---
Wednesday + Thursday + Sunday 18:30 - 22:30 UK (19:30 - 23:30 EU). 
---
Recruitment:
---
Recruitment has been going well in the build up to Classic‚Äôs launch, however we are aiming to target these areas specifically:
---
1 x Fury Warrior
---
3 x Rogues 
---
4 x Mages 
---
1 x Holy Priest 
---
3 x Warlocks
---
1 x Resto druid
---
2 x Holy paladins 
---
Knowledgeable/Dedicated players of other roles/classes should of course still considering applying since there is space for wiggle room. 
---
Application:
---
Please apply via this link: https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnNEavPo4j?i=x4oZnqGA.
---
Or contact Shane#2310 or Zyepox#1969 on Discord.
---
My brother and I did hunter priest. The mana burns are insane and the hunter peels + scream make them both very slippery. The ranged damage coming out is very potent.
---
Don't forget to friend every semi-decent tank and healer you meet. Also friend the really good DPS (not necessarily damage, mages who are good at decursing and mid fight CC are worth their weight in Black Lotus).
---
ITP; guy admits he has very little information about the game and complains that other people don't know what they're talking about.
---
I thought it said fear you fat pig. You played on a private server I played real vanilla. Go pretend to kill rag on a fake server again pleb
---
Except Blizzard trailers never gave me the chills as the Naxxramas trailer from this dude. Ok maybe the vanilla one
---
Like I get why but absolutely detest the streamer vibes - maybe at 28 streamers are just not marketing for me as an audience but it seems to be 30 year old plus streamer plays up to 15 yo crowd for cash. And the cancerous followers
---
It also makes coffee. Which helps with the "grind"
---
\*Uses hamstring trick\*
---
\*Pulls extra mob\*
---
\*Dies\*
---
Youre right!
---
Because its fun to have a challenge and also a nice project for me and the wife to get interesting content without having to adhere to a Raid schedule.
---
the world needs to stop making stupid people famous
---
In vanilla I played a hunter and had a friend who was a very skilled PvP mage, so I'm quite familiar with the match up.  
---
A 1v1 at 60 with gear I'd say is in favor of the mage, although it does require practice. It takes practice for the mage to learn how to abuse the deadzone. Once you got that covered as a mage it's quite difficult to win as a hunter, given you have limited range (duel)   
---
This changes a bit when you add items/trinkets/nades etc.. but in general I'd say the mage has a slight edge in it's toolkit.   
---
That said, if you fuck up as a mage, you'll most likely die. If you get caught out and the hunter is able to unleash his burst you'll either die or need to be able to reset. Since hunters can do lots of damage.  
---
The above is talking about MM/SV hunters, BM hunters are another issue, but I'd say IF you can survive his red pet you can win, perhaps double IB to waste as much of its duration. They can't scatter trap you (since they won't have scatter if they have a the 31BM talent) and their pet's intimidate is a stun so you can blink it to avoid the freeze trap.  
---
In world pvp, honestly I'd say if you catch a hunter off-guard (we're not tracking humanoids all the time!) you can get them pretty easily, it's more of a who engages first, kind of deal. If they go for you, you gotta go for them, you can't really run from a hunter, and if you engage be sure to not let them get away, since if they have endless room to kite, they can. if that happens it becomes a bit situational with mobs around, hunter kiting you in cheetah getting hit, gets dazed etc... 
---
This all said, hunters and mages make good friends when they team up.  
---
tl;dr Purely from a worldpvp perspective if you see a hunter, don't hesitate. Engage. Screw them in their deadzone and Kill him! If you do hesitate and they are hostile they kill you or can kite you endlessly. While leveling, if it's a BM hunter (red pet) run! Unless you outlevel him and have double IB, then you might stand a chance!
---
It's not being pessimist, but the reality of RNG. 
---
Some guilds only had 1 TF max 2 during the whole vanilla adventure.
---
So the RL will Always give the TF for the MT who will be ALWAYS there connected 24/7 to do any content.
---
I also hardly see how will you get it with you time investment.
---
lmao
---
Wow that sounds intense! Those are complex pulls too so you must have really been min maxing your time
---
At least people should stop throwing money at them.
---
Where‚Äôs that post?
---
If you're going herbalism / alchemy, just stick with those 2. Alchemy can make you a ton of gold since things like mongoose elixirs, free action potions, resist potions, and flasks always end up selling for high amounts. It's pure profit if you're gathering your own herbs too. Plus the buffs you'll be able to give yourself while leveling will be a boon. My advice is to make friends with a blacksmith and just trade them potions for gear. The only stuff you really need from blacksmithing for leveling purposes are green iron armor and a few pieces of truesilver (the breastplate is great for a long time.)
---
Likewise the duelers can just go to another area. Player agency amirite? Nobody is forcing you to broadcast your location, and Blizzard doesn't have the resources to watch every duel that occurs (except if you're a privileged streamer God deserving of Blizzards extra attention lolll) 
---
But going to another city means you might lose out on your enchanting business, or your lockpicking farm. So it's actually much worse than just having your duels interrupted.
---
What makes it a poor weapon? The on paper dps is comparable to LBRS 2handers, so (with my limited knowledge of melee) it should last into level 60 5 mans, right?
---
Deathwing is chilling, smokin a hookah in that game. It's a weird one and blizzard didn't think it was up to their standards
---
It's a fucking beta stfu
---
Basically best fit IMO is 30/0/21 druid.  Starfire is your right click (long cast big dmg if hits), moonfire is your left click (instant for low dmg, lets ignore the dot), throwing out rejuvs is your healing orb, faerie fire is your discord(?) orb and a barkskin/tranquility is a poor mans Zen Ult.
---
Thank You!
---
I've been wanting something like this since forever.
---
Everyone giving you shit but I actually agree.
---
It's just like the Kardashia's 
---
I hate the world we live in
---
My girlfriend: this reminds me of battleships  
---
Me: B1

She: \*insert suprised pikachu meme\*
---
most dungeons are 5 man before level 60
---
Already on it, I use Comcast, so its technically like dial-up with all the random outages.
---
I think completely dropping my normal human life for 2 weeks of cave living is enough for now haha when AQ is out and I need more farming time ill see how I feel about them then.
---
Saved! That was what I wanted to hear!
---
This, plus if you stay together you can protect the hunter deadzone with fears.
---
Well done on fixing it all, it certainly takes a heap of patience and commitment. 
---
/salute
---
git gud.
---
So jealous of you all, we have a blackout period on vacations from 8/05 - 9/10 and most of those days I work 10 - 12 hours. So not too much at launch but will get to progress slow like I want to do anyway.
---
    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
---
Druid goes really well. The druid can root opponents, faerie fire stealthies, heal you, and has excellent mobility while you have decent mobility, tons of CC from traps and good ranged damage. A good hunter druid team is difficult to deal with if they are defending a flag in AB or if they are working as a duo in WSG/AV.
---
Hey I'm playing Warframe while waiting for classic! Though I stopped Wow after BC. Are you far into Warframe or a noob like me?
---
Weapon speed causing it to do little ability damage, especially for Warriors.
---
I am prepared for the reactions. I'm really curious to see how many of the current experts will be at the top of the food chain after classic is out for 6 months+.
---
It‚Äôs the weapon spread
---
I never saw anyone say VC (can be a US thing). DM was Deadmines, DM:W, DM:N etc was Dire Maul. No one misunderstood ^^
---
RemindMe! 96 days
---
It definitely felt more like a rpg dungeon crawl than most of the others. It, SFK, and Maraudon are some of my favorite experiences.
---
There are a couple of bows, but ROK will be your biggest bow you can use. If you want to use only bows the next upgrade DPS wise is out of Princess Huhu from AQ40 but it is a DPS increase not a top end increase or slow speed. The reason Xbow's are so good is the fact that they have the slowest speeds which Aimed shot scales off of as well as you have a less likely chance of clipping Auto shot with aimed shot. In naxx there is a bow as well off Razuvious but it's pretty good for Melee dps. But the Xbows from AQ and Naxx are far superior for top end and slow speed which will cause your aimed shot to scale the best.
---
Can‚Äôt speak for OP, but for me, it‚Äôs the same reason I love BRD.  I like big instances with lots to do.  DM had the three wings and plenty of stuff to do.  Tribute runs were always a favorite of mine.
---
Yes youre right I should have read before blatantly replying my mistake. Well thanks for the quick reply though!
---
I took off 2 days - the 29th and 30th, living in the states this will give me a 5 day weekend returning to work the following Tuesday. Goal is mid 40's by then. I'll have to casually play for a few weeks after, til my son is born, then fit in what I can while I'm on parental leave once he shows up.
---
It must have been quite slow with a warrior tank? Were the druid able to cast lots of offensive spells or did he have to conserve most mana for healing?
---
I'd take fighting into WotF over fighting Paladin cleanse any day.
---
I will be starting my journey with no addons. 
---
I'll only look into addons around lvl 30 probably.
---
It's to fast for an arms warrior, The damage is pretty weak.
---
Dont take time off work for a 15 year old game idiot
---
Mmmm yes fear my rogue &lt;Stabystab&gt;
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Taking off the week of launch.  Its a 6pm EST launch on the 26th and I plan on fucking up my sleep schedule so I can play 18/6 from that point through labor day.  I hope to hit 60 by then but I'm not holding my breath.
---
On private servers a third of horde will be undead, I'd wager there'll be less min-maxing on Classic so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
omg 2-3 dozen gold from a raid is a payday... last time I played I mostly played TBC and could farm more gold just killing things and vendoring greys. I think I need to look deeper into gold farming and professions.
---
any advice on fury vs rogue for raiding? haven't done either tbh, only 2 classes i haven't really played
---
As i couldnt put in UBRS (as its 10 man), I put my vote on Stratholme, specifically the Undead part.
---
To me, strat UD is nothing really special, just a good, well made instance. And quality without special frills is awesome.
---
We dont know if asmongold has permission or not
---
and second...
---
Classic wow is number 1 on twitch when streamers are doing this kind of stuff. Blizz is going to want to let the events play out
---
"So called experts" called by the vieuwers.
---
When the AQ was opened on my server, the Alliance guild doing the opening had a little speech prepared that they typed out. Some representative of the top guild on the Horde side read it out too for the Horde hanging around to hear it.
---
Don't remember anything that they said though. PvE server so no one could just go and kill them either.
---
You will see Sony/soda/mitchjones and a few others top bracket. Every other streamer will just be trash as usual. Getting carried by a stream..
---
Ret paladins are much better in PvP, though, and to buff them for PvE raw DPS then they would be absolutely broken in PvP. Old school MMOs weren't about DPS. It was a tradeoff of DPS for utility.
---
It also helps that warrior damage scaling was off the charts amd should have been nerfed slightly.
---
Inferior beards to the Tauren?! If you mean pubic beards, then yeah I'll give you that.
---
Why do you have to bring race into this, man? Are you racist?
---
Lol that‚Äôs just from it being worn out. It‚Äôs certainly supposed to be black but it‚Äôd been in the trunk of my car for almost two years before I took it out last night
---
&gt; Found the illiterate
---
idk man he said "ilk" he must be pretty smart
---
G600. It‚Äôs good, but the software is eh. It also has an issue where after time the left click starts to double click with a single stroke. My last one bit the dust that way but I bought another and it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. 
---
It also has a bindable 3rd mouse button that you can assign to a modifier and i don‚Äôt think the naga has that. Im not sure about the Corsair. 
---
I also think the Logitech is more comfortable but that‚Äôs just my personal experience.
---
No mate just the highest rated show ever, better skip it
---
They trow money for entertainment. Not knowlage.
---
They said all instances will be 5 man, including UBRS.  This has to do with the engine that the game will be running on this time around.
---
There are more classes than Warrior that can use 2 hand swords. Paladin, for instance. Or the one melee Hunter per server.
---
I subbed twice...
---
I totally understand where you are coming from.
---
Believe me, I wouldn't and couldn't game for a living, especially with an audience like some of the famous streamers have. 
---
I don't mind streamers and I love the content from quiet a few. But it is the humble ones! Why do you have to proclaim so many of them to be THE expert at vanilla? Why not take a modest approach?
---
Maybe I'm just too old for this kind of scheme.
---
You heard it right folks, ban Tipsout please
---
non blizz font used besides the cities
---
I'm wondering how this is supposed to be easier than realm mergers
---
Do you think we will have TBC after classic?
---
oooo or better yet, dont even wait for classic to end! that would be amazing, TBC is my favorite expac so everyone should like my idea
---
Probably the incredibly high base speed (for a 2h) of 2.6, which makes it quite bad for every attack that uses base dmg.
---
I imagine it's really good for Paladins that use Seal of Righteousness over SoCom for leveling, because they have no attack that deals base weapon dmg.
---
They will? I thought there was no info on BGs yet?
---
I don't know man, priests were the kings of middle finger ASCII emojis in the forums. TBC and onwards druids were even more entitled than Priests.
---
&gt;Ogre instance in Feralas was
---
Dire Maul I believe
---
Well since end game for classic wont be going anywhere, then essentially we all have more.time to achieve these things
---
Nice, thanks for the share
---
Wow is that really TipsOut? What a piece of shit.
---
I think its important to add that you are speaking in a strictly raiding aspect. Ret/prot are fine in 5-mans.
---
Procs are all over the place with how they function in vanilla / classic. Some items have a flat % chance on hit and there is no internal cooldown / diminishing returns while others have "proc per minute" limitations such as a paladin's Seal of Command ability. Certain weapon chance on hits have internal cooldowns like this too, so the way it works is a bit esoteric. 
---
To the best of my knowledge there is no way to increase the likelihood of chance on hit effects through pumping stats up. There are some chance on hit effects that scale with spell damage though, and these are very valuable for classes that thrive off this mechanic such as ret paladins and enhancement shamans.

---
Does wotf work on fraud suits?
---
IMO I think they should have expansions, but they are separate realms and you have to choose if you are taking each character in the expansion or not 
---
You want to keep your prot Warrior in vanilla? Fine go to this realm 
---
You want to take your PvP mage in to TBC? Fine go in to this realm
---
This way, the player pool will be split up so there can be less realms per expansion and keep the realms at a good capacity for playing, but players also have the option to play which specific game they want to play
---
Thunderfury is an item thats still being acquired for the first time when BWL comes out, you need materials in BWL.
---
Also if you are late to the raid scene why would they give you thunderfury?
---
I got stress test invite and nothing else. Figured it rolled over to a beta invite but I was wrong, the client is no longer an option in my Battle.net. 
---
I got beta access for BFA and I gave a lot of feedback thought that was worth something but seeing how BFA turned out I feel like they could care less about feedback. 
---
I was subscribed all throughout legion which I suspect was the main reason I got Beta for BFA, but I guess the thousands of dollars I‚Äôve poured into boosts and race changes could be a factor too ü§î
---
&gt;Keep Orgrimmar local.
---
this is the best way to help the environment. 90% of all the plastic in the Maelstrom comes from Eastern Kingdoms. The zeppelins used to ship goods back and fourth create more pollution than all the kodo and direwolf mounts in Azeroth combined.
---
Very much a US thing, then lol. Your version works just as well. Oh well. Cant be the same everywhere.
---
if you arent hitting 60 till after you think people will have thunderfury then you are super casual
---
Tips wtf?
---
shadow fang keep. 
---
I want shadowfang for my 19 twink rogue. 
---
I had assassins blade back in the day on my rogue but never shadowfang.
---
tank warrys are always in demand for 5-10s
---
for a raid you only need 1-3 (def spec) some bosses might require more but mostly its an fury with def equip or even just a shield.
---
for a raid you can stack a lot of fury warrys but for 5-10s why would you take one? no cc no utility rather take a rogue for sap/stuns
---
if you are flexible you will find your place, if you insist on furry you will have a bad time outside of raids.
---
also somehow every warry thinks he gets thunderfury.
---
I played on Smolderthorn, wasn't around for the 2 weeks the gate opened as I was moving for a new job but man I remember farming green dragons with grimlok for hours to get his green shards.
---
See another guildie of mine kardlonoc yelling, brings back memories!
---
Yeah Underbog. TBC had some fantastic dungeons as well. 
---
\- Shadow Labs, Underbog, Arcatraz, &amp; Blood Furnace are a few of my favs. The  Auchindoun stuff was ok, I just didn't care for that zone all that much or most of those dungeons.
---
I wasn‚Äôt even mad. LoL I just can‚Äôt wait till launch.
---
If you really played vanilla you would know the word "terror effect" the moment you saw it. When Death coil entered the game, it made quite the impact. You'd also know that no, the majority of the horde players are not undead and no, an alliance warlock is not hands down autolose against any and all kinds of undead just because they have will.   
---
but you didn't, and therefore you don't.  
---
So keep that "pleb" stuff for yourself, how about that, bro?
---
hands down BRD full clear + escort , just the first time though , not talking about the other times
---
I've taken a month off, 27th Aug - 27th Sept.
---
on top of that driving to the gym adds like 20 mins total for me
---
They do exist and many of them are current developments.
---
But when suggesting addons you have to be aware of which ones are ported to modern Classic client.
---
I plan to take that full release week off.
---
Must have been a pain !   
---
It took me so much time leveling to 60, so I can't imagine how long it would take by just grinding mobs.  
---
Just curious, what's your country ?
---
That's exactly right! It's the reason why you can't do this with a rogue even after crippling poison, it takes advantage of using the slowest 2her you can find.
---
maybe hes gonna level reallly slow, and then expect to get sick loot for his great contributions to the guild
---
I have bound "Open all bags" to 'I'. Can you tell me what I miss out for not using Bagnon?
---
I opened one to ask how should I contact Blizzard to give them feedback on how they monetized the beta and didn't give enough information on numbers and the real chance for invite depending whether you're a veteran, wrath baby or brand new player and how does lack of subscription till now affect your chances to get in. What happened was people subscribed for nothing because there wasn't enough information. Eventually I mentioned that selling a chance to get in for test is immoral although a company might not care as long as they make the quick buck but I suggested to change their protocol to either be more open about this.
---
I got reply ticket saying that they understand where I'm coming from and how it might seem bad but there are currently no ways to contact anyone nor give feedback. I left it at that and haven't still subbed nor heard anymore about how they handle the invites. So see you at launch
---
&gt; All this talk about World of Roguecraft and rogues being 1v1 gods! Where?       
---
That was filmed on patch 1.3 ish, this is patch 1.12. It is over a year after that and most classes have received huge buffs/talent re-works. People keep forgetting that WoW Classic represents the very end of vanilla, after all of the class buffs, and many QoL improvements.   
---
I mean in early vanilla Moonkin wasn't even in the game. Spirit Bond was Hunter's 31 point BM talent. Priests still had Focused Casting. Let alone luxuries like meeting stones, linked flight paths, linked AHs, wands toggle on/off, talent respec costs decay, fear nerf, and so on.
---
\&gt;Found the pizza cutter. All edge and no point.
---
God damn.
---
Did the opposite soon as i heard the classic release date, i hit that unsub button, See you guys in 3 months!
---
Sweden. For lower entry jobs the norm is 25 days vacation a year. But if you work for a good company it's usually around 30-40. I think most west european countires get around 25 days a year actually, so it's not unique to Sweden.
---
That doesn‚Äôt even make sense
---
I find hilarious that there's this specific precedent as proof! good work :)
---
yeah idk why he thinks he gets to cut the 6 other warriors who are the mt and ot....
---
Who cares it‚Äôs just a game. If u don‚Äôt want to watch the streamers u don‚Äôt have to
---
fun fact: downtime is one of wow classic's biggest strengths.
---
Did it for the first time last night on a pserver. Burning gnomes with hellfire just felt right
---
Action bar add on
---
Unit frame addon
---
One bag addons 
---
Auction house addon
---
Threat and dps meter.
---
In answer to the question...maybe that would be good. As others have said, not all will search to find if a question has been asked before though.
---
In answer to all the people who get angry at the repeated posts about stuff ... There are going to be a lot of posts. People are hyped, for a game you all love. Does it really matter to anyone that the same questions are asked? You know that you have no obligation to look at every thread right? It's better than having a sub where no questions are asked. Let people live and get carried away with the hype, please.
---
***#NoChangesIsLiterallyImpossibleSoLetsTryAndManageOurExpectationsALittle***
---
Never even touched retail WoW in the last 5-6 years. What this community does not need is people who, in a vacuum and within a single sentence, condemn a whole faction class (alliance warlocks) just because one of the enemy races has an ability that stops one of their 30+ spells for 5 seconds, with no context whatsoever given.
---
He clearly doesn't know launch day issues.
---
Except the spell batching simulation affects other areas of the game.
---
I would prefer if batching was in the game for pvp balance sake but the loot lag is insane. 
---
I'm not sure if it's related or not but pets react extremely slowly aswell which is a balance issue making hunters and warlocks much weaker. 
---
If batching means the game is artificially lagging everywhere it's maybe not worth it because it's a change either way. 
---
Again, if they can add batching as it was without breaking other parts of the game, go for it, but until then it's worth discussing.
---
Hi, /u/Rebugamer
---
Maybe you are a Cylon? Final five?
---
you mean like "of the whale"?
---
Good explanation.
---
Classic stormwind theme.
---
HARRY CHE RAY.
---
I thought I wanted in on the beta briefly but I played like 4 minutes of the stress test and decided it wasn't necessary. I was happy to provide some login hijinks data the first test, but I had no desire to play an "empty" character the second test. It felt like wasted time since I'd have to start over for full release. Anyone else get that feeling?
---
interesting choice :) I also will start with only the most important ones. But I need a UI framework :)
---
Actually this might not be so bad since you can ghetto aoe farm once you get Hurricane. Just dot mobs around you moonfire insect, then barkskin and hurricane around you. Its been so long honestly I cant remember if there is a talent that improves hurricane. While its not as good as a mages farm, you can still do quite a few mobs if theyre a level or 2 below you.
---
JEsus, the obsession with streams is quite pathetic, I never cared or streaminers and only started because of the massive hype I had for classic and I'm thankful for them doing it. Fuck the hate little haters give, so what, some are great at the game, some suck, I could care less and neither should you. And stop obsessing about every time they break the rules, Classic was made for the rules to be broken and that's wwhat made it great.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to stop people from living into trying to help centralize all the information so it is easier to come across 
---
You ppl are all so angry it‚Äôs very weird
---
great point. I hope I can skip this one you are right. Hopefully a UI framework has it included
---
no system would favor the person who came in after progression. in that case DKP is your best bet, since you acquire points just by being there
---
but see I would argue that smoothing over / streamlining those features is exactly what killed the "soul" of the game that people want back with classic.
---
And I dont see how a subscription should change the threshold for the content? I still payed 60 bucks for a souls game -- are you saying if I keep throwing money at it that it should just get easier / more convenient for me?
---
and this is why everyone should roll on boe items
---
why even play
---
Dammit I just ordered a 48 inch print of the original one. Nice job! Hope I can get this one instead
---
Yes, you are right, i should have clarified that!
---
good luck
---
In WotLK once in Wintergasp there was me and Alliance druid, we were both resto and we were figting for the rare herb there.
---
After like 20 minutes we just moved from the flower never picking it up in full health and full mana :)
---
I agree with you!
---
But it wasn't me who suggested them, I just know these addons because I play pservers and I know that Questie and LazyPig, at least, are vanilla only addons (to my knowledge)
---

---
That was a bruh moment
---
Cool story bruh
---
You can bring 10 in many, but no one does.
---
I don't think they manually pick people. It's all just a script that randomly picks some accounts. I wouldn't be surprised if they handed it to a few specific people like popular streamers though. So, I'm already contradicting myself in this comment.
---
Brut blade is okay, but there is other optionsü§∑. Luckily I play horde as well.
---
&gt;  You can always fake fear and try to get them to blow wotf.    
---
You realize WoTF breaks fear? Why would they pop it before they're actually feared? The 5 second immunity isn't why WoTF is good, the extra trinket out of fear is.       
---
Undead Horde will have two ways to break fear on independent cooldowns (PvP Trinket and WoTF). It is a really joy being an alliance S. Priest (45 second cooldown on fear, your only CC).
---
limit fps to 15 too
---
Hunter gear forsure
---
Nope
---
What the CD on WotF?
---
Now whats the Cooldown on fear?
---
oh okay.
---
Yes, pure melee classes have more additional strikes due to instant abilities like sinister strike, overpower, whirlwind, backstab, etc.  Druid's do not benefit from chance on hit weapons because all their melee ability comes from animal forms. Animal form only benefits from raw stats on whatever is in their mainhand/offhand.
---
I can't even begin to explain to what degree this post is wrong.
---
Wont be taking off until the second week. Should be \~15 or 20 by then and then I can possibly get to 45 or 50 during that week depending on server stability and what not.
---
Logging in to the game with my first Tauren for the very first time during EU closed Beta. It was late at night, the moon was high, I was looking down the blueish-green meadows and the theme for Mulgore kicked in. Got me good.
---
&gt;BLOOD AND THUNDER GIVE ME LUMBER
---
This sounds like the opening line to a wow porn parody right before the music kicks in.
---
Okay. I mean people are still teleporting in and out depending on my quest stage so I'll still call it Phasing lol.  
---
Either way I'd rather have it completely empty rather than doing a quest and get killed by someone from a different server. Happened yesterday where a guy killed me at 30% hp and all I could think was "wow sucks that he happened to teleport into my realm right as I did that quest" and that kinda sucked. 
---
Not like I'd ever meet him again and there was something VERY salty about getting killed by someone from a different server that I'll probably never meet again... I just miss being on one server and recognising names again.
---
There are tons of streamers who don't do that, you just need to look past the top viewed streamer in the section. All content creators with the largest audience are pandering to the lowest common denominator, that's why they have the largest audience.
---
you should be 60, make sure you plan your leveling path. You already invested with time off. make sure its worth it. And im not saying a speed run. But just something to prevent down time.
---
Id like to take off the first week, as i think i can make it to 60 before the following monday if i did that. but my dang wife wants to use them for vacation.... SO im taking off the day after so i can get in 24 hours and then close to 72 by the end of the week
---
I am interested in good content.
---
I really dislike the attitude of some of them though. It's ok to not be the best in a game but then don't take a position where you proclaim yourself as an expert.
---
All according to plan... ^(villain laugh)
---
My problem is their over reliance on pirate server for their opinions. They have "experts" that they interview or podcast with that admit they never played classic ever.
---
I'm planning on tryharding the game but if a friendly oomkin needs help, I might joke about him being an oomkin but help him nontheless.
---
I think introducing new people to the game we love is a lot of fun.
---
They don't *have* to min/max to do it, they *choose* to min/max because the content is so easy they get their fun in getting the fastest kills possible, which requires min/maxing.
---
wouldnt your work find it fishy if you take vacay and sick time at the same time?
---
I second the G502.  Best mouse I've ever owned.

Even the git bot is jumping in on this,

---
Eastern kingdom looks like westeros...
---
This is pretty much the reason I'm playing a PvE. I had an hour to play on a Pserver the other day and the entire time was spent running to my corpse due to gankers and then moving zones.
---
Glad I gave this a try as I was "PvP no questions asked" but was quickly reminded how many people have no lives and will spend their entire evening ganking lowbies.
---
Pretty much. I would not do it again, but my 13 year old self sure was a scumbag.
---
costco has some of the best prepackaged foods ive ever had
---
Controversial opinion, but I think it's unfortunate that people hate on players for "meme specs" like ret/prot paladin. Seems like some of that hate should be directed toward the devs who intentionally made ret/prot not viable builds, by design. Tigole and Furor in particular - they went on a public rant about how paladins need to be put in their place and how much they hate paladins. They were pretty opposed to hybrid classes in general, but especially paladins.
---
I religiously watched that episode at least once a year from the day it aired. It's just so good and captures the essence of the game without being true to game mechanics. That tells a lot imo.
---
!RemindMe 75 days
---
Even funnier for me is that some claim to be experts in vanilla when they were like 7 years old when the game was out...
---
I was 28 when vanilla came out and just because I played back then doesn't make me an expert at all (disclaimer: I was terrible back then, WoW was my first MMO).
---
you literally cannot burn through it all in 2 weeks...
---
just go get the quest in orgrimmar and go to booty bay follow it and you get peramnent portal
---
Just like you said in your last sentence, all the top big streamers have beta access . Which is smart on blizz not even saying it isn‚Äôt
---
&gt;Lok'tar Ogar, brother!  
---
Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).  
---
Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.  
---
They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.  
---
What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and*Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.

The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.  
---
Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

its just sooo good

I‚Äôm willing to bet most of the ‚Äúexpert‚Äù streamers were named so by the mindless mass that follow them and not from themselves.

This data:
---
[https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill)
---
obtained from testing on the beta, suggests that +5 ws is indeed "worth" +3% hit towards the hitcap, which is 9%. Further, the glancing blow reduction is big, dropping from -35% to -15% over those +5ws. And you'd need +8ws to get full glancing blow reduction to 5%, although the last point of WS is only worth 2% glancing damage so +7ws is probably going to end up being the soft cap. I suspect that +5ws is really going to be the minimum for tanking, with +7 being BiS. 
---
I'm not sure if weapon skill is good or useful after that point, it seems that there's very little avoidance reduction and crit increase to be obtained, although I'd love to see more exact numbers on that. If you're putting together a TPS set I'd probably go for crit &amp; AP over ws at that point, with what we know now.
---
anyone remembers the naked orc ele shaman dueling r14 chars? i forgot the name.
---
you might lack some spelldamage but as long as you got engineering you will have fun in pvp
---
At least one of them claims (present tense) to be one of the best Warriors in Vanilla existence.
---
AQ mount is definitely luck.  I'm not getting one because my name isn't Asmongold or Sodapoppin.
---
I farmed up my 6th token and let my sub die again yesterday. I don't think I'll resub til classic. I'll post my xmogs when I resub for classic, but I think I'm done with retail for good. It's weird.
---
I mean, there are quotes from Tigole and Furor that they specifically designed prot and ret paladin to be trash because they don't like paladins and wanted to put them in their place.
---
I'm willing to wait my turn. Im not going to be massively late, just a little behind the super hardcore guys, as well as a rolling as a tank, it puts me in a position where it's still obtainable. I'm content in the fact theres not much chance of me getting it, but what's wrong with trying aye?
---
1) My GM pissed me off one day so I went into trade chat while she was raiding. I told everyone that she was giving 5g away for anyone who sent her a special word. I can‚Äôt remember the word but 14 year old me probably though of something like anal beads to say to someone. 
---
2) Next was mage porting ppl in BGs. Cracked up so hard.
---
3) Next wasn‚Äôt really wow but ventrilo - get on and keybind to voice to a specific someone. Talk mad shit during the raid while raid leader is talking. Only did this to that one guy who got super tilted easily. ‚ÄúSTFU WHOEVER IS TALKING WHILE RAGHNAR IS TALKING JESUS CHRIST YOU PIECE OF SHIT‚Äù - silence fell upon the raid. ‚ÄúAre you... okay -name of rager-‚Äú and id just snicker
---
4) doing the /e -name- has reported you afk. Please type /afk to notify you are not, in fact afk during BGs.
---
5) Ticking mining nodes while other ppl did it, but never actually cared to take the loot. (I‚Äôd give them the ore if I won the tick bc I‚Äôm not that big of a troll) idk why that one always cracked me up, but some ppl always felt so defeated when they thought you got their thorium.
---
6) Setting up campfires in the AH (or maybe it was the mailbox)
---
7) Killing alliance AH sellers
---
These are probably more grieving but I always got a laugh. I know there are more but I can‚Äôt remember them all.
---
Unless the only thing you want to do is 1v1 world pvp it‚Äôs fine.  If literally the only thing you will do in classic wow is play by yourself and just world pvp 100% of the time then go horde it‚Äôs probably better
---
Perfect.
---
How is LBRS 5 man and UBRS 10 man when they're the same instance?
---
Meme
---
I would agree for some that this is true.
---
But alot of the streamers/youtubers I'm talking about have guides on youtube where they spread the same nonsense that gets repeated everywhere.
---
I didn't say you were doing anything. Your post was fairly well reasoned I thought. It was more that some of the comments here (although not many) are about being sick of seeing the same posts. There are rules about this sort of thing in other subreddits specifically so that people don't see the same questions all the time, but when its a hype subreddit then that seems to me to be going against the spirit of the sub.
---
I'm not angry.
---
You should also only listen to music from 2006 or earlier while playing, and constantly talk in chat about how George W. Bush did 9/11.
---
what backward ass school is this? unless you are adding a week at the end, i would love a week off from class...
---
This man gets it.
---
You need something to do if you're watching streams of people levelling 1 to 30 in a fucking beta.
---
Yes but once you factor in the +1% Cap reduction it's effectively back up to +3% hit. A rogue with 300ws will need 9% hit to never miss, a rogue with 305 ws will need 6% hit to never miss.
---
Wtf
---
I have two straight weeks off of work. And they know it is so i can poop sock to 60 as a warrior as fast as i can.
---
 When I fall under the map, i‚Äôm disconnected from the server like in BFA.  
---
In Vanilla you could fall under the map without getting disconnected, so you died in the void and ress at graveyard ( this one is about exploration, for example you could fall under the map from the Dun Morogh Airport tunnel and swimming up to get inside Old Ironforge, and there is other explorations to do like that, like an authentic experience )
---
ik, just saying
---
Far from the best way, but still not my imagination.  
---
And I am pretty sure it is intentional... they are cash grabbing now and with the "reserve your name \*two weeks\* before launch".  
---
Anyway, the OP is just for fun... don't read too much into it.
---
It's always been like this
---
The thing that he posted is a screenshot of a tweet where someone took a picture of their screen. 
---
The person who took a picture of their screen is the one who didn‚Äôt opt in to the beta and then opened a ticket asking to get in. No surprise there eh?
---
Wow, thanks Satan!
---
Hey everyone ! Knowing that blizzard has stated that they are going to remove layering going into phase two we run into a glaring issue. What is going to happen to the streamer servers/ larger servers that still have massively bloated population ? Im talking 6-10k+ potentially. I absolutely hated playing on servers with population that large and it completely changes the way you can farm in quest in game. Yes we are expecting a drop off of tourists in the coming months of classic. But what happens when it doesn't drop to acceptable levels ?
---
If anyone has any other solutions that were not described in the video or thoughts or concerns please id love to hear it.
---
I think it is not enough information to make a definitive judgement.
---
Supposedly ret sucks at raid dps, so the fact they'd rather take that "bad" dps over them makes them insanely angry and jealous. Just shows how bad and annoying they must be as a player.
---
&gt; Having your pet sit by your side in the range camp 
---
I never mentioned anything about this. You want the pet to be in range of melee, but if you send it to attack the boss, it will die from the melee-range AoE.
---
Yes. Warlocks are great in PVP. Class racials make the difference in 1v1 situations, but in group situations (the majority of pvp encounters in this game) your class abilities will be great. Plus perception will help you detect and dot rogues.
---
You might be autistic if you‚Äôre this obsessed to complain to low level customer service employees about not getting into a beta.
---
Being good and being an expert are 2 diffrent things.
---
I'm going to make a list of all the servers they intend to play on, specifically so I can find one they aren't on, especailly Asmongold or whatever his name is, what a f'n tool
---
&gt;  but what's wrong with trying aye?
---
you dont seem to be trying, you look to be trying to manipulate the system by being "late". Why not try and be a core member of the raid team, heck like the MT and then you get it if you prove yourself?
---
if you wanna just dps and expect to be rewarded with TF you are fooling yourself
---
Remindme! 80 days
---
Yeah. We raided in vanilla with both a prot paladin and a ret paladin. They wore cloth in MC and healed. Sometimes the ret paladin would go into melee with Nightfall if we didn't need the healing.
---
We had a couple of feral druid healers, too. They were low priority on all drops, so they had to wait for everyone else to get geared up. They were some of our most dedicated players, in it for the long haul.
---
Strikes me as odd that this ‚Äútalk‚Äù just links to your YouTube channel.
---
I remember it wasn't uncommon to wipe at 60 when someone aggrod the bar during a fight, or while going the path to the last boss (Emperor something was it?).
---
I'm looking forward to some crazy wipes.
---
I would like to see wod after Classic.
---
Back in the day I thought SM was end game content ü§™
---
this would be horrible.
---
I usually watch youtube/twitch for about an hour to an hour and a half before I go to bed and am done playing myself. No need to watch them level from 1-30 to realize that they are really bad at the game.
---
Chad barrens
---
Lol at that last pic
---
Here‚Äôs the Science for anyone interested:
---
TL;DR- WoW is a drug and the music bringing you back is just your itch for more lol
---
I work in Education and a neuroscientist yearly does seminars in my school about the effects of drugs on the mind. One thing that he mentions is how the things you see, hear, and the people you interact with while taking the drugs become associated with those feelings. The reason why is that the dopamine released during that ‚Äúevent‚Äù basically takes a snapshot of your current setting and everything about it.
---
These feelings, and the release of dopamine, is something that most WoW players experienced (especially those I know who played in vanilla). I myself have the music thing happen with me often as well (for example the song War Pigs = the hills south of moon brook in Westfall). I was astonished by the neuroscientists study so I asked a question at the end and he did confirm that things other than drugs can provide the same effect if they were joyous and released dopamine in the same way.
---
Hey that was my brothers hpally in vanilla lmao
---
If you play 18/hours a day for 14 days straight pretty sure its a 1 to 60 + mount/topped most prof , after thst its the weekly grind for raids
---
I know what decurse addon does, have players on private servers the past 3-4 years. Dont think you will ever see a raid with 13-14 mages+druids anymore. More likely its 8 total. 6-7 mages and 1-2 druids.
---
This highlights the one thing I never did like about wow (and dark souls 2 for that matter) - the stark divisions in the biomes.  I get the need to create different areas but it isn‚Äôt gradual, it just BAM here‚Äôs some different shade of sand/trees/plants.
---
follow up with TBC still, but Magtheridon is lord of outland, not illidan.
---
The mythic/mythic plus dungeon system of live.
---
Fear is just a crutch that bad Warlocks lean on.
---
I might be a strange case but I'm open to them. I guess it's because of having been in such a position before (it was during tbc-wotlk, though). 
---
Of course, this doesn't mean they can slack and should be using their utility as expected. Healer is struggling? Toss a heal here and there. DD drew aggro? BoP and so on. They might not be the best but as long they play properly (so if they play like the utility DD they are) I consider it's fine having them. 
---
Even locks struggle early on, they suck during leveling dungeons if leveling aff/demo as most do.
---
More like 'Banned4Life' :@ 
---
jk &lt;3
---
My vanilla name was my real life name. I plan on doing the same for classic. I have a name that is spelled uniquely so I have a good chance at getting it.
---
Your best bet is to be nice, and make friends along the way. Be the one to take initiative. When you get a group together, make use of your utility to set yourself apart, and be noticed.
---
Make sure you have soulshards, so you can summon those who are the furthest away, make healthstones, and soulstone one who has res. Make an effort to have quests ready for sharing, offer to cc mobs with banish/succubus if needed, keep fire shield on tank. Small things matter.
---
If you learn to fear juggle with curse of recklesness, without aggroing other mobs, or take damage, you will be noticed by people who know what that is, which largely will be beneficial, since they most likely don't suck.
---
If you weave life taps inbetween casts, instead of tapping from 100 to 10 % life after each pull, your healers will take note. Let your healers have the spirit cloth that drops, if they want it.
---
I, for one, love grouping with good locks. Have fun!
---
I think that people who will play ret pally because they watched Esfand is a very small percentage of players who will play ret. In my opinion, it's a bit ridiculous to criticize someone who genuinely enjoys playing ret pally.
---
Peggle
---
It's 17%, and I don't think it's possible to hit it at all, actually. I could be wrong, never played a caster in vanilla.
---
I'm not trying to manipulate anything bro. I'm just saying I'm not gunna rush to 60 like alot of people. Whats wrong with enjoying the ride and still putting in 100% effort at endgame. If I just wanna dps I'll make an alt haha
---
Proceeds to fail jumping a gap twice and has to resort to using a swiftness potion to make it.
---
*facepalm*
---
I took a full week off. 
---
I plan on getting easy heat and eat food or ordering out the whole time. I am going to 18+ hours a day a warrior and try and reach max level in that time while recruiting for our friends and family guild. If I hit max I‚Äôm going to help my wife level. 
---
After the vacation is over going to help guild mates level and gear/attune to get ready for MC/Ony. Whenever we can field 40 people going to raid Sunday‚Äôs and maybe one other day of the week.
---
Lol was all good until the last part.
---
Someone playing a class spec that they enjoy disrespects others? I don't see the logic.
---
Yeah makes sense they are trying to hype the game up as much as possible 
---
The other responses besides you were so angry I even asked this question
---
Ppl on Reddit are strange
---
Nothing nearly to this scale but I have one song in particular that I accidentally made a similar connection with. 
---
Any time I hear Boom Boom Pow by Black Eyed Peas I instantly go back to killing Welps near Onyxia's Lair back in the day (not classic obvs but still good ol days for me)
---
It's easy to cut while having a fantastic game to play. Don't even notice the hunger.
---
I created a video on the issue. No one is forcing you to watch it. This is absolutely a point of contention and I would love to hear other peoples input on the issue.  What do you think ?
---
It‚Äôs almost as though OP is attempting shameless self promotion. But OP wouldn‚Äôt do that, right?
---
They don‚Äôt have to give you that information about what the exact chances are. They said it was a small pool. They never said you needed to have a subscription to increase your chances. You also didn‚Äôt need to have an active sub to get invited. People subscribed cause they wanted a Chance blizzard never said anywhere to.
---
Only LBRS/UBRS will be 10 man. Every other dungeon in the game will be 5 man.
---
[https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5)
---
This is testing data from the beta server. It suggests that 305 ws will result in 6% miss chance.
---
BFD and SM! Been ten years since I've done them.
---
So it's fine for all celeb streamers to link to their youtube channel but when one random noname wannabe streamer voices their opinion it's heresy.
---
Double standards much?
---
Same, don't think it is a good expac but having fun with my friends. Ele Shaman and Survival hunter pretty fun
---
There are lots of ways to deal with a camping griefer.
---
1. Ask your guild to help.  I don't like this option, becuase that gives the griefer exactly what they are looking for.  I personally loved this when I was greifing someone, I would make sure that they died everytime I rezzed.  I would have a whole list of raid targets, for priorty kills, and just work my way down the list every rezz.  Healers are usually the first to break and leave.  anyone /yell is always very close to the breaking point and will be leaving soon.  Having a lone character tie up 30-40 guild members trying to protect you, and you still die every rezz cooldown, for hours, is very fun, and the guild will never come to your rescue again.
---
2. Bring your main. I don't like this option either, because now the griefer knows two of your characters, and knows they have upset you, really giving them what they want. Now as a griefer I know two characters that I KOS, and camp because it bothers you.
---
3. Start a raid, if your getting ganked, odds are others in the area are also,  if enough lowbies group up they can kill even those most twinked out character.  Only thing that sucks more for a griefer than having to run away from a lowbie zerg, is getting killed by one.
---
4. just ignore them, and keep rezzing and doing what your doing. Sooner or later they get bored trying to get a rise out of you and move on to someone more entertaining.   you would be surprised how effective this is, usually only 2 or 4 deaths is enough to bore most griefers. However if you start /yelling /spit or emoting, then The greifer knows your really bothered, and you just prolong their interest.
---
5. Just rezz right behind them, and attack them very clumsily  every time your timer is up.  They quickly go from feeling uber, to someone that is picking on a mentally challenged person, removing any thrill of victory.
---
Personally, I liked to rezz then /thank my griefer , and then attack them again and again and again even if there is no chance of victory. What they don't know, is I've added their name to my list, and for the rest of my time on that server, every single time I see them I will do everything I can to kill them, no matter how out geared or out leveled I am, I will abandon raid night, I will leave groups, I will drop out of battle ground queues, I will abandon quests, and just starting trying to kill them. When I finally level up enough to start killing them, and they bring their main, I add that name to my list.   When their guild shows up to protect, I don't leave, I kill them, them in front of their guild and then start down the list of guild members. I keep doing this, until the day I run across you in the world,  and kill you out of habit, and you don't rezz, and just leave your corpse there until server reset removes it, and I never see you login again.
---
As a disclaimer I'd like to add that these are my opinions based on my vanilla experience from long ago and a lot of the answers would change depending on the situation, context is key.  
---
**Which class excels for healing?**  
---
I personally always felt paladins edged out over the others when it comes down to purely healing while also remaining defensive yourself in PvP. If you want more utility I'd say it comes down to Druid or Priest, I'd personally favor the druid. Shaman I don't think is the best healer, they do bring utility in other ways (windfury, grounding etc), but personally I think they perform better in PvP as elemental with off-healing.  
---
**Which classes work best together?**
---
Since you asked about healers first, I asume this is which heal class works best with someone else.   
---
Bottomline I'd say warrior + any healer, it's just a killer combo. The main reason for this is that in BGs (and world pvp probably even more) a lot of players don't go for the healers if a warrior is in their face, and even worse with pally/warrior combo, they generally don't go for the healer if he's wearing plate and a shield. Warrior/Paladin is maybe the best one, the only thing that really gets them is getting kited, but then you won't really die either, so if you're holding a point it works like a charm, depending on what you face, if you're up against players with brains (so an actual threat) it will most likely become a battle of attrition.   
---
But to come back to my disclaimer, context. If you're talking specifically WSG and specifically flag carrying, I'd say healer / Feral Druid. Feral Druids are the best flag carriers.  
---
Another thing can be taste, if you don't want to play something up in their face them pally/warrior won't be a very good idea. Priest/Lock or Mage are pretty damn good as well.
---
If you want to be more sneaky Rogue / Druid, especially in world PvP, are a LOT of fun!   
---
Hunter, imo, works better with another DPS than a healer on average (hunter/mage are like a CC/Kite champion team) but if I'd had to pick, I'd probably go with Druid healer for this one, since they can heal on the run and a hunter will be kiting a lot, a druid can keep up.  
---
Shaman I think works best as Enhance or Elemental with another DPS probably warrior since they are so so dangerous with windfury.
---
Thrall travels in time to prevent the first invasion

Do you realize what it takes to get rank 14?

I resubbed for beta, got the stress test, had a bit of fun with it then canceled my sub when the "classic wow beta" button was removed from my launcher. Now we play the waiting game until release zzz

---
Intended Raid Times: Days to be decided when ready for raiding, times will be 7pm-11(12)pm Server Time.
---
Priorities: Raiding and PvP
---
Rules: We use Teamspeak and a guild website, mainly for the legitimacy and community generated.

Descent's officer team are a group of UK players who have been playing together since the early days of Vanilla, we have run multiple guilds together throughout WoW's lifespan, and on Nostalrius. Vanilla experience of the team includes killing C'thun and clearing upto Kel'thuzad in Naxx. We intend to run Descent in a traditional format, not too hardcore, 2 raid nights, maybe extending to 3 or 4 during progress later on, focusing on PvP to play around with our newly gained phatz. We are looking more for sociable personalities that wish to enjoy the game as a part of a community. Apply via the website which is checked daily, and will have news posts leading up to release.

Not really. The numbers I'm aware of floating around from pservers have 9% miss chances, that's the same thing here. If anything it's a nerf because if you're shit geared, you'll miss 1% less.
---
Wait, really?   
---
Like, you can do 10 man Deathmines?
---
If you played Vanilla, you would know it's "Horrified" - it's a horror effect, not "terror".
---
Howl of Terror is also a "disorient" (tooltip) effect in Vanilla sharing a DR with Fear (charm) while a horrify is on its own DR.
---
You can thank Google and the myriad of Vanilla databases.
---
It's honestly about the same for druids. If you're not resto, you're a waste of a raid spot. I understand why and have no problem speccing resto for raid. Hybrids aren't supposed to be on par with purses for dps. Otherwise, might as well just all role hybrids. Pures deserve some extra oomph for not getting the sustainability hybrids get. Makes sense to me.
---
Queues would be normal
---
Complains about streamers make YouTube videos about them lul
---
Why?
---
Having the expansions on separate servers would be the best option if you were going down the expansion route in my opinion, otherwise the moment you add TBC to the classic servers then you may as well fire up the petitions to bring back vanilla again.
---
Im rather sure they are NOT pushing out new beta versions as soon as they can. Get a bigger list of fixes put them ingame before doing a new release. Because frequent release would result in people just retesting every known bug after ever small change. 
---
And it would be time lost from finding new bugs. Havent really followed the beta version numbering or if it updated. Since there are no patch notes available.
---
BRD because as a warrior there‚Äôs some great drops.
---
Agreed, hstring kiting doesnt work as well as pserver on the beta. You have to run 2x farther than what pservers coded for.
---
They link to their own YouTube channel on their own stream oh boy.
---
Maraudon, Dire Maul, UD Stratholme, BRD Emperor runs, Deadmines
---
Didn't watch the video but I would assume you just transfer off the server?
---
I use to run with boomkins back in the day, they do ok in dungeons.
---
I'd be happy to run with you if you need a healer, in June 2020 when you are a fresh 60 let me know and I'll be down!
---
For raiding.
---
"Players didnt leave in a rate we expected so we are keeping layring going into phase 2, 3, 4..."
---
Its so obvious its gonna happen. WoW devs struggling with dealing problems they themself created is like watching Dumb and Dumber.
---
&gt;I was 28 when vanilla 
---
Let me get this straight.  You were 28, meaning you are about 43 now and still watching twitch.  No wonder you are so mad.  Your life sucks lol.
---
Ha! So that's why tons of folks aren't getting in! What silly little geese!
---
A bit off topic now, but I'll respond since you're curious. I'm from Sweden. I just read up on the rules about peternal leave to make sure I'm accurate here: Between the two parents you get a total of 480 days. But 90 days isn't sharable, so my GF will have to use 90 days. That leaves me with 390 days. Out of those, 300 days pays 80% of my salary. There is a roof here for how much the government pays (around 3.5k USD a month), but if you got a good job the employer usually forks up the rest so you actually get 80%+ of your salary. Mine does that.
---
The rest of my 90 days, and the 90 days that my GF gets pays very little; around 25 USD a day. But they're good to have when you absolutely need to take time off work. By law, if you apply for paternal leave with at least 3 months notice, the employer has no right to reject it.
---
My situation is a bit unique though, because my girlfriend recently arrived to Sweden and does not have a permanent residency visa yet. If she had a good income as well, we would probably split the days 50/50.
---
Who the fuck does this to a beautiful kitty
---
But then what happens to the people who purposley picked low population servers to get that sort of experience? There now screwed.
---
Like soda doesnt get carried by his stream.
---
Oh a side note: *quivers look great*
---
You can technically do LBRS with 10 man. The loot won't be worth it and you can't complete the quests because most of them are group and not raid content. UBRS is the other way around - all quests are raid marked.
---
It was bad a pally had it in vanilla.
---
running 100m is easy as fuck too. just fuck off dipshit you‚Äôre too stupid to communicate with.
---
Not complaining at all. nor did i at any point in the video. Just trying to find solutions to what is 100% going to be an issue. They have massive followings and it will become a problem when blizzard removes layering.
---
This is why I want to play a pve server, I'm going to be a casual pleb this time I feel like, but the world isnt as alive in a PvP server so that worries me. So I'm just kind of stuck I dont know what to play on.
---
You were just building credit /s
---
Why wouldn't I watch someone playing a game I love and maybe even learn something in the process.
---
Gatekeeping gaming by age is probably the stupidest thing I have read in this thread.
---
Hey mate, if you're interested please visit [http://www.descent-guild.com/](http://www.descent-guild.com/) we will be a raiding guild that aims to have a community atmosphere planning to use classic medium of guild website and TS3 for communication. Aim to level a core group to 60 and start progressing towards raiding, the guild is intended to be tight knit, however the early first couple of months the guild will likely be over populated due to the amount of people that wont reach 60.
---
Oh, Im sorry, we are comparing vanilla to classic, not private servers :)
---
Jokes are supposed to be funny though.
---
your timeline is all wacky, rushing to 60 means you did it in less than 2 weeks. if you expect people to already have thunderfury, this would be like 3 months in at the earliest, this is slower than casual leveling speed.
---
&gt; rumored to be playable soon afaik 
---
Quite frankly I havent heard of Vulpera being a rumored race since launch. 
---
Sure people were making theories at the beginning but no one has said anything about it for months, not even the players.
---
Look at all the filth jumping in to defend streamers lol. I agree with you man.
---
This is exactly what im worried about. probably the absolute worst option out of the bunch. Would completely ruin so much of the essence of classic
---
Lol. This is just getting ridiculous already.
---
It seems that you are using the wrong adjective here. You can complete raids with ret and even prot paladins. That means that they are viable.
---
When the game launches every server will be a "high pop" server.
---
Nobody will pick low pop servers because there will not be any such thing.
---
How dare you.  He has already mastered Classic!  Reeee
---
What would I like to see?  An alternate timeline where threads like this aren't made.
---
Does this route skips any quests ?
---
i cant tell if you are saying you be burned out or not
---
how many people got invited to beta? 5k? 2k?
---
hiw many streamers playing classic can you name
---
Well, you wont see 13-14 mages+druids in classic. Well, ofc you can do loads of things in classic, but other than some RP guild, i dont see that happening.
---
There are definelty good ones!
---
A lot of quality content on youtube too. But some are just terrible, glad they get exposed by actually playing the game and not just talking the talk...
---
I had a whole list for different classes, but the last name I used was 'ohgodfleas' for my Druid
---
Offer Transfers. Thats what they did in retail. This is a non issue
---
Do we know at what time of the day it launches exactly?
---
Can you guys give context ? 
---
The problem with this subreddit right now is the number of posts related to streamers, without any context.
---
Like, I don't know what this dumbfuck Asmongold did, give me some informations.
---
The first 2 or 3 points are worth it for glancing blow damage increase, from 85% to 93-95%. But it does seem like we go from +0.2% hit per ws to +0.1% hit per ws after hitting 305. I'd imagine the benefits diminish in a similar manner for +crit and mitigation reduction, but I don't know.
---
I'd put solid cash on an edgelord troll being a better tank than an edgelord orc. But if you're a human or orc already, it's probably true that you'd benefit more from a pair of mitigation or hit gauntlets than edgemaster's.
---
Pretty much. That's why I think it's justified to call it brain damage. 
---
Another addition: I think it was self-evident from my post, but I think I should clarify this. The effect that playing the game had on me helped me to repair the damage that was done by playing the game in the first place. Excessive grinding is not a healthy activity and has serious negative side effects, mostly in the form of missed opportunities to learn something. A repetitive life doesn't make you grow, it just makes you older.
---
The real question should be "should I roll a mage counter class because of all the scrubs rolling mage"
---
He says don't play ret but plays ret himself. Monkeys sees monkey does.
---
I didn't ask for access if you didn't understand yet. It was just complain about the company's greedy business practice and the correct way to give them feedback. I even mentioned and apologized the person reading for not being the correct person for this but wished they could enlighten me. Forums don't work because I don't have active subscription and it would be stupid to complain wow on hearthstone forums (I still play blizzard games but I wish there was a way to let a customers voice be heard).
---
It's not that hard to understand what is written so I knew the very first day I wouldn't get in beta as I wasn't subbed. They were just so quiet about while thing and let people sub and wait for nothing. Few my fiends got in stress tests but didn't continue sub as they were a bit smarter after. That was the thing that annoyed me. But sure.. Protect your precious company and open doors for more bs that is happening in gaming industry. The problem is just me, right?
---
(I think the original reply is gone so i just pasted my reply to you)
---
Can‚Äôt ban the best idea ever. If they skip to WoD then all the changes from Cata never happened.
---
&gt;You also didn‚Äôt need to have an active sub to get invited.
---
Yes you did.
---
so funny, I hear songs today that I was listening to when i was leveling through vanilla and I can tell you where I was questing when I was listening to that song/album.
---
Every race has a 5% stun resistance so it‚Äôs really more like 1 of every 3 stuns gets resisted 
---
I personally plan on going orc when I make my lock, but that because I like the looks of the orc males being jacked and a caster 
---
Oh also Orcs pets do 5% more damage which in PvP is not as helpful as PVE, will still be a difference
---
To mages it was solo end game content :p Bloody mages.
---
Whoa, keep it up, proud of you.
---
Full run brd, afk, deadmines, and stratholm.
---
I am cool with humble streamers because they often have good content but the trend I noticed is that the more "famous" one gets the worse it becomes in every aspect, reaching total insanity which makes you question the world we live in on a daily basis.
---
Some of us have it down to ~90 hours. Almost all of us have it down to ~120 hours. For those classes that struggle and could use a bit more time at 60 to gear (mainly the tank), we're using teams in shifts. The Main Tank, Off Tank, 2 Healers, and 6 DPS (that's about 25 to 30 people) will be hitting 60 by Saturday evening, giving them 2 days to gear up as best they can, especially FR.
---
And yeah, we know Pservers aren't 100% accurate and that realm population and server stability might slow us down, but we've been practicing our routes on the overcrowded-as-fuck-since-Classic-was-announced Paervers too and making adjustments. Stress Tests and Beta were/are a good source of reference too, but not as much with the level cap (and most of us didn't have Beta when it was first launched). We're mostly sharing Beta between us to work on addons and have everyone get their UI good to go for launch.
---
I've leveled 7 rogues to 20 before I got a time under 12 hours.
---
Then we copied that best one 10 times and I leveled all but one to 30 before I got it in under 24 hours /played.
---
Then we copied that best one 9 times and I leveled 5 of them to 40 before I got it in under 45 hours /played.
---
Then we copied that best one 8 times and I'm currently pushing for 50 in under 70 hours /played on my 3rd rogue-copy.
---
Then I'll do the same and hope to get to 60 in under 100 hours /played.
---
Every person of the raid team is doing this.
---
Once I do this, I'll finally have access to the guild's internal repository of routes (we're not sharing them with just anybody, they're worth more than Joana's) and I'll do it all over, trying to shave off whatever I can.
---
I've studied the footage of these routes, plotted them all out on one map to compare, recorded what to buy from vendors where, told my addon what quest rewards to automatically accept and equip. We'll have support staff churning out bags, potions, crafted quest items, major BoE upgrades, all of it. Everyone on the team will be able to afford their mount at 40. I'm probably not even going to pick up Skinning. There are several key dungeons we'll be running for weapon quest rewards for classes that benefit greatly in leveling speed for them, there will be a tank and healer set for each (not part of the final raid group). Hell, we have one guy who's only job it is to level 25 and fish and farm in Stonetalon for the mats to Fire Protection Potions (we can't depend on the recipe for Greater dropping). All in all, this is an effort of about 100 people. We even have PVP bodyguards and several Alliance ready to peel annoying gankers away with "Hey, wanna do X dungeon? We need 1, ready to summon." They'll also be MCing us and giving us Paladin Blessings for the raid if we need them.
---
We have exactly 185 hours from launch until raid reset (3PM August 26 to 8AM Sept 3). We're starting the raid as soon as we can, but no later than 170 hours. I'm budgeting:
---
* 36 hours for sleep (6hrs for Tuesday night -&gt; Sunday night /w 2 all-nighters, one at launch, one at raid)
---
* 3 hours for hygiene
---
* 8 hours for yoga
---
* 8 hours for food (which I'll probably eat while playing anyway)
---
If I can make my leveling mark, that gives me 15 hours to get attuned, get my quintessence (if needed), grab some key pieces of gear, and help anyone else out (or maybe take a nap before raid). If my 1 to 30 gets busted by server madness, I'll have this leeway or I'll sleep less.
---
Yes, we're obviously aware we get one Tranq Shot book. The hunter it's going to is going to be hit-capped, but we're fully prepared to wipe 1000 times (not that our practice runs have shown us we'll need them).
---
Tanking dungeons isn't that hard as prot pally by the way.
---
Hahahaha... Some people's intelligence
---
At max level, you'd almost always speedrun instances with a group of 8+ people. Most people were farming their class sets, so you'd want to bring one of each class so that the loot didn't go to waste.
---
Sometimes we'd get a group of 20-30 to spam Stratholme runs to help gear up some guildies. 10-15 people would clear trash while the rest killed the bosses. Instances were very easy with a large group like that.
---
UBRS is the place you'll live in if you're at all serious about Classic and supporting your guild, pve and pvp.
---
He said he didn't boys, we're all wrong.
---
Tripled! Oh God, that's amazing
---
This was me 2005, my mum was extremely concerned when she came into my room one morning to find me asleep in my chair with my headset on, the logon screen on display. Ahhh, it was a good year.
---
We don't actually know the mitigation reduction values for weaponskill yet, so I'd hold off on that. That said, it's actually better than you imagined, +5ws gives 2% "real" hit \*\*on top\*\* of reducing the hit cap by 1%. 
---
But we don't know the mitigation reduction values yet.
---
Sure, if you spent the raw time skinning 8000 mobs you'd get that gold per hour. However the time is spread out over the whole leveling experience. Some dumbnut's gonna see that Gold per hour and imagine you get 43gold per hour just picking up Skinning while leveling. 
---
I'd say a more useful stat is what i calculated from your numbers, you loot on average \~1 silver more per mob you kill if you pick up skinning than if you hadn't.
---
The novel was sooo different
---
They posted everything that was required to have a chance and haven‚Äôt changed anything they posted since then. You were smart enough to understand. It‚Äôs not blizzards fault others didn‚Äôt.
---
Everything lol
---
Once in a life time trip to Scotland 10 days after launch (I‚Äôll be on this trip for 20 days). I will be going to work. Then I‚Äôll come back from my trip and keep going to work bc I took too much time off. Bittersweet...
---
It will be easy if you are with a group of people that knows how to play.
---
how does this ecosystem even work
---
People will probably do 10 man scholo farm runs as it's more efficient for that big instance - lots of different pieces of loot fairly spread out among lots of trash.
---
And I never said that. I said that in Vanilla, there was an addon that decursed for you and it made curses trivial. 
---
There was no logs back in Vanilla, nor "optimal" gameplay, setups or gear. 
---
People did not play for damage meters, as they were rare in the beginning. 
---
So when people said decurse, people did just that. 
---
Like, our guild had 4 druid healers for a long time. 
---
There was out of combat ress, as in, you just out ranged the combat and kept ressing. 
---
So again, Vanilla is not private servers. I never argue that it will be like vanilla. I just stated how it was back then when someone asked a question about addons.
---
They said you had to have sub for chance and opt in both wow and classic betas to get invited. That's all they said and we're quiet about since then. What happened was brainlets bought a raffle tickets and were disappointed. I never mentioned they didn't have to give any information, they really didn't have and they really didn't give either but it looked as immoral business practice which I wanted to comment but had no way to provide my feedback thus I asked where should I go and gm apologized that there isn't actually any ways for that. So I let it go.
---
It cannot be overstated just how good Hardiness is: 
---
It's +25% to your baseline resistance of 5% against stuns, so you end up with 30% stun resistance. So you're looking at a 1 in 3 chance, rather than 1 in 4. Mind you, it's not only affecting stuns, but also works against engineering grenade, which will be a staple of Classic PVP at all levels and will get tossed around **a lot.** 
---
Orcs are the best race for PVP period, but UD aren't unplayable by any stretch of the imagination.
---
As cheesy as it sounds, if orc warlock is best, but you'd quit in your level 40s, because you can't bear looking at it, as an example, what good would that do you?
---
That said, for 1v1 warlock mirrors, UD are obviously best suited to win that, but I'd not choose my race based on that one specific instance, personally.
---
Yes but on pservers a rogue with 300 will miss 9% so it‚Äôs not the same thing.
---
I mentioned this elsewhere but tanking 5 man dungeons as prot pally isn't hard. Just because it isn't the best doesn't mean it's useless. It adds flavor to dungeon runs as well. Once you start putting in rules that certain classes are only allowed to do certain things, shit gets repetitive. Of course, if you're part of the min/max community it's different. For most people, just enjoy the experience.
---
Seems right up my alley. Looking to play with an older group. I may be more of a social player than anything, but I do plan on grinding semi-hard. Right now I‚Äôm still deciding on which class to focus on. I‚Äôve been a shadow priest main for a decade, but I know their use in raids is not a high priority. My second option is a druid, which I have plenty of experience with. I‚Äôd focus on healing.
---
That's still impressively close tbh. And in a raid environment, 9% vs "8% but the first +1% doesn't count" amounts to exactly the same thing.
---
I started in December and am currently MR19 and in one of the top clans.
---
It all depends on the speed at which you are trying to level if you are trying to power grind to 60 as fast as possible then you wont want to level as the OOMkin, would you best be off running as feral to level faster in the world and be able to tank your own dungeons for quest rewards. But if you want to level at a slower and min/max fun and fun being a boomkin then send it man. It is classic there is plenty of time at max level to farm gear. Enjoy your time leveling, let your memes be a reality and not just a dream.
---
\-Kyliemanogue the Fury Warrior while leveling
---
He may do sometimes but he actually has the skill to back it up
---
Huh? Yeah its beta PVP and beta PVE. Those are the beta realm names lol
---
Where does it say you have to have a sub for a Chance to get in?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7CZcd-UYmU
---
Will it? I keep hearing that but no one can explain how. It's trying to solve a non existent problem.
---
BRD,
---
I asked my fianc√© this question, she said ST, heresy!
---
Deathmines sounds like a bad time
---
Heh, in America we don't need time of to raise our children during the most formative times in their lives, we would rather get lower taxes!!.... for the rich...
---
Personally i just prefer having one giant bag.  Its easier for me to organize and visualize everything.
---
Also (at least on retail) it has the ability to tell you whats on your alts, gold across your toons, etc.  Theres other addons that do that, but having it all in one is just simple.
---
It also lets you search your bags nice and easily.
---
Not sure how you get the quest but here's a YT clip of Mike Preach using the TP at Booty Bay ...
---
https://youtu.be/RKsDFfRF-QA?t=341
---
(skip the rest if you don't want to watch him go through the instance)
---
I'm assuming by chance on hit you're referring to +1% chance to hit. Chance to hit should be prioritized over all else if you're dual wielding since offhand weapons have a 25% innate chance to miss. It is impossible to get this 25% chance to 0% with gear and buffs.  The majority of gear that has +hit on it will have attack power or str on it anyway so you'll be OK if you just prioritize +hit in most cases.
---
The exception to this is if you are going 2 hand fury, where you will only need 9% +hit to mitigate glancing blows and misses.
---
You can set maximum concurrent player count to 1500 and it will be low pop server.
---
Thats an impossible question to answer because the benefit of hit is not static it depends on what gear and buffs you have, read up on the basic theorycrafting of hit tables to start.
---
Dont forget fishing. Its a gold mine
---
how fast can you farm the tokens?  i never heard of this
---
Yea. It's no ones fault.. My whole point was that I actually opened a ticket as one guy asked does people really do this. Well I did but because I wanted to ask whats the correct way to get more info. Ends up that there is no ways at all. Rip my karma tho :)
---
Lol why are you obsessed with maces?
---
He as well as numorous others watched and/or participated in that homemade pvp tournament in classic.  It's a joke post, it's obviously not bannable.  And Trollgodx was being a complete ass during the tourney, hence the other joke about siding with him.
---
Does anyone know when they will actually be opening up the servers for North America and what time exactly for east coast?
---
Wanted to roll Dwarf Rogue
---
Give me a sec. I edit this comment soon
---
I'm 99.9% sure that's just catnip. The beautiful kitty is just having a beautiful time. lol
---
I drunkenly resubbed to retail because I saw that I was able to use in-game gold and felt like running some dungeons. Played for about 10 minutes and gave up due to boredom. About 5 days later, I got a beta invite. Thank you intoxicated self.
---
The extra swing can be triggered by sinister strike. That 5% is pretty fucking huge.
---
4 banned accounts on history, some with multiple bans.  
---
Resubbed a week before beta and got it. Understandable how people are angry at how beta was handled.
---
I mean in the blizzcon demo all pets were at 2.0 attack speed which happened in TBC. I don‚Äôt see that listed so they have definitely been fixing stuff.
---
So the dueling competition was sponsored by an external company which was promoted at said tournament? 
---
I honestly haven't seen it. But as the terms state, if you said up a competition and pay out of own pocket or with a pool of friends it's completely within TOS.
---
Leader of the pack.
---
You really underestimate the effort these trolls will go through. They even followed and glitched underneath UC. Making another character per starter zone is absolutely zero effort.
---
Assuming weakauras has a Classic version, wouldnt it be easier to just write some for WA that tracks it and has an icon if you dont have poisons on?
---
Yes. It was confirmed in one of the "Summit" interviews a few weeks back. I'm not sure which one, but I believe it was either Tipsout or Staysafe/Esfand.
---
Sometimes, people need someone to confirm for them.
---
Is it just me or is it there a penis in D8
---
Also what's up with those islands south of it and Tanaris
---
Says where?
---
Undead rogues are only played by 13yo edgelords change my view
---
When is couples counseling scheduled for?
---
Camping someone is a normal part of a pvp server isnt it?  The other person can call for help, or go somewhere else.
---
Dya neese akkah.
---
Buy or lease a car.
---
&gt;reallly slow
---
Considering my above math, how slow are we talking about here exactly? :D
---
Even playing at a very leisurly pace, after 1.5 months or so, you are lvl 60, unless you deliberately try not to level.
---
Now, 1.5 months == 6 raids. Assuming full clears only, ideal droprates, and no useless items (we both know that's not realistic), that is 6 * 37 == 222 items. Again: 40 * 16 itemslots, that's 640 ^^
---
Yeah I wonder about this. Like there are countless no names out there right now who are going to surpass streamers and they could care less about streaming. I think too many people look to streamers like they are some kind of god and are bound for glory.
---
Can you even zone in 10 people though for the now 5-man dungeons? You won't get the "There are too many people in this instance" or whatever the error is to prevent too many people from zoning in?
---
It is hard to choose just one right?
---
I will be honest here, I like hybrid specs! Reminds of older times that you had more than the holy trinity roles in MMORPGs...there were games where you would basically be a "support" like a buffer, debuffer, etc...
---
WoW never had something that deviated much from the holy trinity but the potential was there...it was obvious that the devs didn't want that and killed it completely on TBC!
---
That being said, since we are going to play Classic and we specifically discussing Paladins here I felt that Ret Paladins were the most wronged of the "hybrid" classes/specs by the Devs and here is why:
---
Lets take a look of all the sub par dps speccs:
---
* Shadow Priests: Potentially not even that subpar with the talent overhaul and changes of later patches but even if they keep doing way less damage than other spell caster, their spot in a raid was not "wasted" and was useful to at least have one, because they would improve all of your Warlocks DPS.
---
* Balance Druid - Can still Combat Ress and Innervate and Moonking Aura will be AWESOME for a group of 4 mages. Raid spot "wasted"? Nope!
---
* Feral Druid - See the above and replace Mages with melee classes! Also, some say it might even pull decent numbers with the patch that we are getting right of the bat, I don't know personally but even if they don't...their utility, their reason to being brought to a group its there!
---
* Enh Shaman - pretty much in the same line as feral Druids regarding buffs to melees. Also full of utilities!
---
* Elemental Shamans - I am gonna be honest here, I know jack shit about them in vanilla...I know its a burst specc and it rocks on PVP but on  dungeons and raids? No clue...but even if its not viable at all, you still have Enhancement Spec if you really don't want to heal!
---
* Retribution Paladins - now what do Retribution offers your raid? Nothing...besides potentially being the wielder of Knightfall, a role that can be performed by a 3rd Warrior Tank (right? I am pretty sure but som1 correct me if I am wrong)...Retri offers the raid: ZERO! I am not against bringing one, if you are not running for world or server 1st it will hardly matter at all, but thats not the point of I am discussing here! We are looking at DPS specs that perform way bellow others and numbering utilities that they offer to balance their lack of damage and ALL OF THEM have at least something...but Paladin does not...
---
This is the way I saw/see hybrids during vanilla a balance between your DPS (and in some times healing) capabilities and the utility and value you could offer to balance the lack of "numbers" in a raid encounter, nowadays this doesn't exist and I respect that decision even tho it was something that I liked.
---
But they failed with Retribution Paladins, even more if we think that Paladin Tanks were pretty much useless besides 5 man dungeons...
---
Maybe this is a very controversial opinion here but I wouldn't mind Blizz buffing their damage OR giving them some very valuable utility tool for raids! I know no changes is a thing but I really feel that they got a shitty deal in vanilla if they didn't like to heal but still loved the class, so I wouldn't mind that little change even tho it will never happen!
---
Just 3 days to start.  Wed/Thurs/Fri then the following monday so I'll have 6.5 days straight to play.  I don't want to let it take over my life so any longer I could form some nasty habits.  I'll have some extra vacation left so maybe I'll use some in september/october to take a few long weekends
---
It is indeed [just catnip](https://i.imgur.com/pWqPJCY.png)
---
If you‚Äôre not heart set on hard core raiding - Druid tanking in 5 mans is actually very good.
---
One more thing I just noticed. Pretty sure in vanilla hunters mark with imp talents and non improved talents would stack. I definitely remember having more than one hunters mark on a target in vanilla.
---
I‚Äôll be waiting.
---
They literally cant have it for the world bosses
---
I see the mouse wheel thing a lot. Do you just not change your camera distance or do you use different buttons.
---
Dunno, its classic after all. We did it back in vanilla... But that was before ZG was a thing so.. maybe it got limited in a later patch? 
---
On pservers you can bring 10 man to scholo/strat if you so desire to farm gear. Scholo is just more popular for it as it's a very slow 5 man dungeon
---
Called to check the return policy on wedding rings.
---
You can still do it that way afaik.  I'd assume the curse client will have a dropdown/tab to select classic (i believe right now it has a way to select which folder you want it to keep track of if you have multiple wow folders on your PC, like for retail/PTR, it might be in ther)
---
why the fuck would you watch them then? 
---
this subreddit is fucking ridicolous
---
&gt;but the world isnt as alive in a PvP server so that worries me
---
I think this is a load of bullshit. The vast majority of the spontaneous world PvP is ganking. Doesn't make the world feel more alive at all. Nothing about this level 60 rogue corpse camping my group trying to enter BFD is immersive.
---
What if a low population server gets more popular just on it's own by people joining later.
---
*is met by larger force who no-lifed even harder*
---
People are just classic hungry, can't play themself so watch stream to get annoyed by it.
---
TipsOut organized an dueling tournement wich was fun.
---
Asmongold did nothing.
---
TrollGodx annoyed people by walking over totems and players.
---
No one did anything wrong and people are just salty.
---
Dont listen to anything this man just said as it has several flaws, read up on how hit tables worl, how glancing blows work, and how the critcap works, all of this is available on several wiki pages and forums.
---
I dont understand the need for the beta if you're not invited.
---
Why not playing on a private server? or there are difference with the Beta?
---
Server transfer
---
I really like the Aux addon as apposed to Auctioneer, which can be found at: [https://github.com/shirsig/aux-addon](https://github.com/shirsig/aux-addon)
---
The Archaedes fight in Vanilla WoW was the first real roadblock I remember encountering in the game. And not just because it was full of bugs!
---
Every raid knows to bring at least 2 hunters for tranq shot, most keep 3-4 on the roster in case people are absent. 
---
Rogues are a top dps class that get their fair share of raid spots.
---
Utility isn't a thing in raids. A raid will already have 5 holy paladins so they don't help with buffs. Cleansing and off healing is already taken care of if your raid has the correct composition / amount of healers. 10-12 healers can handle all of that stuff, your job as a dps slot is to do as much dps as possible to down the boss as quickly as possible.
---
Do I hear Supreme?
---
gankergodx &lt;me and the boys&gt; fears no enemy!
---
The only way to properly sim the vanilla experience is to play on mobile. Bad frames, bad turning, latency out the ass.

What really gets me is that Blizzard complained after the MoP beta when they let everyone in who pre-purchased the expansion. They said it was a mistake because they didn't get good feedback about the game and bugs weren't being reported. People played it like it was early access. Yet they that's what they make betas now. It's nothing but early access for streamers and their friends to drum up hype for the game. These people aren't testing anything, they're using the beta to get views, and Blizzard is using their views as advertisements. What really bothers me the most though is that they sent invites to people that don't even play wow - just because they have viewers.
---
Is this a list based on what you think you'll want or is this based on what you can remember using back in the day?
---
Thanks for the suggestion. :)
---
It won't be 6-10k, vanilla max was 3k
---
Thank you! If you give me some time, people found 2 more spelling mistakes I'm planning to fix right now :D
---
God, I used to fall asleep so much from binging WoW.  Late night raids were the worst.  More than a few times I fell asleep while farming trash in MC.
---
Which wouldn't have been so bad if I weren't the MT...  They usually just screamed at me to wake me up once we got to the boss.
---
Because I'm interested in classic WoW content and without watching them how can I form an opinion?
---
I'm also talking about the way that some channels have evolved in the last 6-9 months.
---
Yeah - I think the green marked bits in the spreadsheet are already fixed too - so they are on it I guess :)
---
in true classic. However blizz might not have this available come classic
---
What‚Äôs that got to do with maces?
---
Mostly, and also the high warrior population
---
Thank you! The things you do when you're waiting for classic to come out :D I also wrote 2 guides for the game and it didn't even come out yet haha

Orc all day man, Resisting a stun vs a rogue is way better than breaking a fear. You have to remember the alliance have 4 stuns they can slap you with. They have Bear slap, Rogue, Paladin and warrior intercept. Now resisting any of these is a yuge advantage as a warlock. Especially the rogues when you resist that kidney shot it means they just wasted a bunch of energy and combo points on trying to slap you up side the head to continue their damage rotation on you. Yes i know warlocks have a lot of mechanisms to deal with stun lock like sacrificing a pet against a rogue. This doesn't out weigh the fact that stuns make or break a class. Now think would you rather 1/4th counter 4 classes or counter 1 every 3 minutes. My money is on the counter of the melee which generally shred a lock once they get on top of them. But that is just me. 
---
Side note Orc female is the best model in the game.
---
Would you think hardiness was better if it said "You are 6 times as likely to resist stuns"?
---
No. Your view isn't important.
---
Well, I was diagnosed with Scarlet an hour ago. If this isn't a sign what dungeons to play, idk...
---
They get specialisation with maces
---
It's not the same for druids. Bears make great 3rd or 4th tanks as they don't share gear with warriors, provide 3% crit to melee with lotp, provide an extra battle res and innervate and lastly cats do more dps than ret paladins by a good margin.
---
the community would be way to splintered. The best way to not have people ask for classic again, is actually good expacs
---
We havent seen the actual items and if anything is different than whats sites like classicdb have in the database.  Items and stats arent different in pservers as far as I know but proc rates are likely wrong on weapons like ironfoe.
---
Exactly. What are they going to do with the servers that have multiple layers come phase two. Servers can have a max of 3kish.
---
All of them benefit from having a slower weapon. 
---
Pallies'-wise it is because of the slot machine seal (i.e. seal of command) being 70% weapon damage (so slower==more damaging proc). 
---
For hunters it is both because of its stats (statless weapon with a melee proc...) and again you want the maximum damage for the one melee hit you may weave (since you don't want to stay melee range, just a RS-powered auto while &lt;insert gap creator skill/item&gt;).
---
StaySafe being a huge MinMax player, I want clear the content with all druids or all paladins just to show you dont need all that
---
Dude, I still click today. Its clumsy in PvP, which I rarely do anyway. In PvE, I anticipate movement well and my clicks accordingly. Only reason I'm not top dog dps in my guild is that I loathe timed runs so I don't do M+. I'm all about classic's slow style. Coordinated cc, target kill orders... etc. Going to be glorious.
---
Druid Heart of the wild spec comes to mind.
---
Dire Maul north to be precise
---
Re-subbed, and no beta here. Still check daily. I love how they say they pick people who are dedicated and stuff but there are people that have multiple bans / restrictions still getting in so....
---
Drakki is lvl 63 : [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10363](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=10363)
---
You'll have to check the others.
---
Apparently it's 9% hit for lvl 63 if you don't have 305 in weapon skill.
---

Said the original Blizzard announcement for the requirements to be invited.
---
No they don‚Äôt...
---
I would have said that the people who started to call them instances were people who did play mmos before WoW.  Before WoW (beta) launched, people knew that they would have this new instancing technology, but they did not know that there would not be any real open world dungeons.  People were expecting dungeons and instances, but only got the instances (excluding a few rare exceptions like the hinterlands).
---
Show proof then.

Either that or people are so used humour being explained to them that its lost on them..

Druid because they can go kitty and have all of their dps cat abilities.

Shaman should be fine too since they have all of their dps caster abilities as well.

It used to be called that.

This entire song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l5DkBMQ4to . Mostly it reminds me of doing MC. The best memory of this song is when I was leveling through Searing Gorge by myself and was in a cave underneath the zone and this played. It's the one song that brings back that feeling of playing vanilla WoW.
---
No it‚Äôs vanilla still right before tbc release, there were a few weeks when tbc talents were active and also pets scaling with gear as is the case in tbc.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
See "How do I Play World of Warcraft Classic?".
---
"Releases August 27, 2019"
---
No problem! :D
---
One week, with plans for a second a few weeks after release. I work from home though, so depending on how busy work is I should be able to get 2 to 4 hours of play in during work while using a full hour lunch break.
---
For me, the problem with this is that if you base your decision on other peoples' opinions, you will be more likely to end up with something you don't enjoy down the line. Also people will give you different advice based on their personal feelings and preferences.
---
Scholomance
---
Probably more than your comment...
---
‚ÄúParticipants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. ‚Äú
---
Is what the announcement says. Participants as in people who got invited to the beta. Nothing to do with increases your chances to get an invite.
---
Quivers have models? I started in TBC and I don't think I ever noticed this until the Legion MM artifact.
---
messaging sodapoppin and only sodapoppin every time he logs in to try and get into his group so he can leech his followers just comes across as sad as fuck to me.
---
I'm pretty sure all of them do. 20% discount would mean 640g, which would fit to your "600g" statement.
---
You are welcome!
---
Blizz will still have to investigate it to confirm. To avoid any backlash, they won‚Äôt immediately ban the person based solely off tickets, because that‚Äôd open it up to exploits.
---
You‚Äôd also have to consider the lesser streamers. Those with a handful of viewers. Will they be completely barred as well, simply because of people hate toward the (honestly very few) larger streamers? Would they be barred from streaming raids, which have zero negative impact on the server?
---
If you go for a black and white, all or nothing stance, that‚Äôs pretty shitty and petty because of a few big streamers.
---
Transfer again?
---
Agreed!
---
But can you just put on a movie or prerecorded lecture and play wow while they are watching it? ;)
---
The best jokes are anti-jokes
---
If a Human Rogue that specs into weapon expertise has a total of 310 sword skill is that down to 4% hit needed?  That seems very low.  How does this effect dual wielding?
---
What if I told you that you don't need any addons at release? 
---
^^You'll ^^be ^^level ^^one.
---
More importantly dru/pri/mag have talents that allow 30 percent regen while casting/outside of 5 second rule.  Mag/dru have skills (evocation, innervate) which add additional regen based on spirit.  Nice to have a heavy spirit weapon for a swap during those spells (and blue dragon procs) if mana is a concern.
---
I resubbed using the gobs of gold I got between WOD and Legion.
---
The exact same thing happened to me with my playlist from EverQuest.
---
Agreed. I got addicted to it with pservers.
---
Wtf.. blizzard is adding dual specs to classic? Sort of rather just stay on a pserver now.
---
watched them lots of evidence
---
I was going over some of the old patch notes b/c I kept hearing that all of the endgame dungeons (except UBRS) was 5-man. I think it was patch 1.10 where they made the change, so it should be in effect for Classic WoW. I was just curious if it was just the dungeon quests were changed or if they capped the number of people that could enter.
---
I think I took my first break from the game around AQ and by then I didn't need dungeon gear anymore, so I don't think I ever ran them in their lower cap versions.
---
Magic :D
---
Disc priest
---
Right now I beta  I am using titan panel, questie, ui frames, sell junkie, dmg meter
---
Is what the announcement says from the blizzard site. Participants as in people who got invited to the beta. Not what a third party site says.
---
I don‚Äôt think the bis lists will change in Classic.
---
Always thought Sweden was a beautiful country, time to move boys!
---
Smolderthorn!! This was my home server for so long. Man I miss the group I was playing with on that server
---
Not really at server launches. He‚Äôs right - usually there‚Äôs so much to do in game that a large portion of people will be too busy to gank - except those that just want to gank. 
---
Later on down the server life time though - everyone starts ganking everywhere at all hours of the day. 
---
Pretty natural and consistent trend across many servers
---
That point exists and we have no idea where it is. You could figure it out with some very complicated math. It also changes depending on what buffs and gear you have already; +1% hit is worth more to the guy who already has 2k AP, whereas if you have 500AP, it's worth less. 
---
Basically, what you're asking for is what simming programs do for gear in modern wow.
---
It goes something like Damage Done = (100%-Enemy Armor Reduction%) \* (yellow damage + white damage)
---
Yellow Damage = I don't Fucking Know And I Can't Figure It Out For You Either. It involves Miss %, Crit %, Mitigation % and whatever goes into your abilities times how often you use them. 
---
White Damage = DPS\*(Hit Chance)+Crit Chance\*DPS\*2
---
DPS = The number that shows up in your character screen, equal to Weapon DPS + AP/14.
---
Hit Chance = 100% - Dodge Chance - Parry Chance - Miss Chance - Glancing Blow Chance which is 40% for bosses.
---
Miss Chance = 8% or 27% depending on DW or not  - Chance To Hit Increase
---
Chance To Hit Increase = Increase from Weapon Skill + % Hit Chance(-1 if you're below 305ws but can never be lower than 0%)
---
You'll note that each time you use heroic strike, you need to subtract a white hit from the white damage calculation.
---
So it's a mess. But the basic idea is you'd set up a formula like the above correctly, and then plug in gear changes and see what spits out the highest overall dps. It's too much work for limited gains.
---
Get to the hit cap for yellow attacks and don't worry about it.
---
Thats what im hoping for.
---
Hope they go the OSRS route
---
The title didnt actually exist until patch 2.0, I believe.  You just got the mount.
---
This resonates on a deeply personal level. It makes me wonder how many of us out there fell asleep in an MC raid atleast once.
---
There's a quest ([Rig Wars](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2841) from engineer in Org) that enables a second one in the same place ([Chief Engineer Scooty](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=2842)) which sends you to Booty Bay. This one's a 2-step chain (the one sending you there, and a second of just waiting there until complete) and it ends giving you an item which allows you to use the transporter there freely.
---
People did not make pre-raid bis guides back in the day, as far as I know.  Public theorycrafting was not really a thing until Elitist Jerks became popular due to their C'thun post, which would have been in patch 1.9.
---
Prior to WoW, raids were not instanced and guilds were more competitive with each other.  People did not really work together publicly as you did not want to give your good information to other guilds.  People were very surprised when Conquest released their Molten Core guide, as that kind of thing did not happen before.  There were not any good character/gear guides, though.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Ok, thanks for clarifying, that was just about what I was thinking as well.
---
"Edgelord trolls" are what most of the twitch chat is. :)
---
Is it possible you put em in your bank?
---
Joana has a great guide, don't know what problems you had with it. If you'd like an alternative I've also made a [1-60 leveling guide](https://www.sage-guide.netlify.com).
---
Yes and I‚Äôm not disagreeing with that? You don‚Äôt have to, but some people like to compete at things that look easy on the surface. but you aren‚Äôt able to comprehend my point because you‚Äôre clearly too stupid to try to communicate with. just fuck off and eat a dick.
---
TukUI and ElvUI are what pfUI is based on/mimicking.   They aren't just similar...they're literally the parents of pfUI
---
Ohhh I remmber giving shit to alliance on our server for not pulling their weight back in the day
---
Sick of this discussion
---
I do the same thing!! A lot of triggers with music and South Park as one of the two was always going on in the background
---
&gt;You also didn‚Äôt need to have an active sub to get invited.  
---
Good job. You've proven yourself wrong.
---
Case, rested.
---
We haven‚Äôt had the chance to test anything of significance. We only have access to lvl 30 on beta, which doesn‚Äôt fully reflect how we will play and items we will have access to when it goes live. We‚Äôll have to wait until they raise the level cap on beta (if they do) before we know anything concrete.
---
Guides for private servers will be a good basis, since most of it will still be relevant with minor tweaks to account for live differences. Ex: aiming for slightly more hit. But the core of the class is known and will remain the same.
---
Nostalgia is OP.  I can't fucking wait!
---
Chill bro. We're all riffing here.
---
I don't know what ShestakUI is, but TukUI and ElvUI are nearly the same thing and they're whole UI replacements.  The biggest difference is TukUI uses more config files and custom plugins to adjust and configure things whereas ElvUI has basically anything you could ever want to adjust available in in-game menus.   It seems to have more "baked in" functionality than TukUI also.  Think of TukUI as linux and ElvUI as windows, but they're ultimately very similar whole UI replacement suites.
---
I would only consider Deadly Boss Addon "must have" for release out of the things you listed.
---
Titan Panel for example is just a complete waste of screen real estate.
---
My group tried to 10-man RFC but we were told the instance was full as soon as 5 people were inside. Did you do anything in particular to get it to work?
---
Very low drop rate and all the hunters want it. Not everyone is gonna get it
---
Wtf? Lots of older dudes watch and play video games. I don't need to be younger than a person restoring a classic car to enjoy it.
---
UBRS but unless I missed it it's not in your poll.
---
That's what Blizzard said. But there's been a ton of questions on the validity of that and examples of them breaking that principle. Honestly no fucking clue. They say one thing and we see examples of the other.
---
Don't forget cooking regardless of what you do.  Warriors benefit greatly from cooking- you want to be using bandages to heal whenever you can but the stam/spirit cooking buff gives you a lot of value over time.  Plus as you level, the +8 or +12 stam/spirit sell very well to raiders and there are other types of food as well that make good$.  
---
Fishing is a chore but also makes great money for very little effort
---
A combination of queues and free transfers. They were very adamant about removing layering by phase 2, and I believe them.
---
Cdew saw two players killing a high health mob. He asked for an invite, and when he accepted,  they phased layers which reset the mobs health.
---
The challenge, it was harder then other instances and unique with better loot, librams and its own pointless rep. The size? Well it wasnt bigger than Scholomance I think or BRD (i dont remember ever fully clearing BRD with its 20 bosses)
---
omg it took me forever to figure out anything on this sub.
---
You took a week off for classic wow too? In my reason why I put "Classic WoW"
---
Uhm, what? The sub price was the same during Vanilla WoW.
---
He doesn't even know what he's talking about. Some of the popular classic streamers are older. I don't even know of any that are "half your age"
---
I used something similar but ended up writing my own because having something that tells you when your poisons have ran out isn't as useful as something that tells you when you have 15 charges or 5 minutes left - having your poisons fall off in the middle of wPVP was horrible.
---
Druid with heart of the Wild spec is a true hybrid. As long as you keep four sets of gear you can cat dps, bear tank, heal AND even PvP with a single spec.
---
Feral dps with a high amount of effort is even competitive in this spec so you can theoretically swap from healing to dps on a fight by fight basis... But the effort is not to be underestimated; extra gear, manual crowd pummel farm, consumables for two different roles and more
---
No, I can't. Blizzard can. But why would they? Do you have any proof to link that they will be doing this on some servers?
---
No way
---
Wow noob here. I really wished there was FAQ on thr sidebar. Would help a lot
---
It‚Äôll cost the same splitting them would just increase the cost for those that would play both.
---
So you want hit to a certain point to increase your crit cap because the equations is something like 19% crit + hit % = crit cap so if you have the inate 19% crit cap then 11% hit you can have a 30% crit cap. You would have to find the forum post i am at  the office and their internet filters block the access to get the exact numbers but i know that if you are 60 and under 700 unbuffed AP it is a DPS loss to use Blood thirst over Heroic strike. So make sure to keep this in mind. But you want to scoop all the hit gear you can get as early as possible. As a fury warrior the Devilsaur set is incredible through MC. Unless you go for voones vice grips and cloud keeper leggings. Either way be prepared to spend a lot of gold on gear. As a fury there are a lot of Preraid BIS/Bis items you get from crafting.
---
\-Kyliemanogue
---
Apparently so according to streamers. All of the high end goodness like @mousecursor and @cursor are there. The reasoning is that Blizzard made lots of changes to reduce bot scripts so it's safer to use the new engine
---
Instead of merging database data they just turn off the layer that isn't needed anymore.
---
I thought about resubbing last week but then realized...what a waste of money...I can't play Classic until August and I'm not going to play BfA until then so what's the point?
---
I think a warlock viewpoint is nice here as we sit quite near the top of the threat meter for most fights. 
---
I 'd say generally most dps only worry about threat between 100-75% health, after that a good tank should be doing enough dps/tps to keep the boss easily. This is obvioulsy untrue for bosses that drop threat and hae other threat related mechanics. A good dps will also pop potions or other non-damage abilities like life tap to let some threat fall while doing somethign useful.
---
Why would they?
---
Sorry going to be to busy stocking up and selling greys for epic mount.
---
no
---
I'm Horde, but I absolutely love Elwynn Forest music
---
Once you saved the group of NPCs at the top of the stairs, about 100 elite and non-elite trolls spawn at the bottom to guard two bosses who also spawn down there. You and your new NPC friends have to fight your way down carefully as to not pull them all at once, but eventually you have to kill them all. Then the bosses. And then your new friends when they get mad at you
---
Sameeee, pretty sure I was in an all Druid guild alliance side when this happened üòÇ
---
As of today the information they've given is that there will not be a classic only sub and you need the regular subscription which gives access to both retail and classic. That being said, they might change their mind in the future but I don't think it's likely they will.
---
We don't know how much hunters are going to be popular. On the one hand they're popular on private servers, on the other hand basically every poll on this sub says hunters will be in the middle of the class popularity, maybe not even that.
---
I took a week off and it ends in a holiday. Truly 7 days to play.
---
That seems like a very delusional sentiment.
---
36 vacation days?! That's 7 weeks wtf, I just started a new job and I get fkn 0 vacation days and only like 1.5 weeks next year (from what i accumulate this year) you must either work for the government or live in Europe.
---
Ehm.. Holy nova spam Ooms you really really fast.
---
The one thing I agree with you on.
---
I have a few that im looking forward to seeing again, though i didnt play Vanilla.
---
I started in early to mid Wrath (7-8ish months after it came out i think?) when a friend from a different (super shitty) MMO talked me into trying it because i was bored as shit.
---
We did RaF, and they had a friend that ran us through quite a few dungeons for some easy xp, and to see the game a bit.  Funny enough, it still took me over a month to get to max level...heh.
---
Anyways, the ones that i still kind of remember are: 
---
**Stocks.**  Easy to get to, easy to run with lowbies in tow...well, when one isnt a dumbass warlock that insists on attacking everything....and dying a fair amount because of it.  A level 80 paladin can only do so much to keep mobs that are 5+ levels higher off of you lol
---
**SM.**  I dont even know which wings we all did.  I think all, but im not sure.  Honestly i'd have to log on and check my achievements...though now that i think about it, i think at the time there may have only been one for SM (to defeat the final dude?)
---
**ZF.**  Honestly, i dont have the huge nostalgia boner that everyone else here has for it, but i do remember the stairs...and again, being the asshole that had to drop Rain of Fire and pull agro.  Man that poor, poor paladin.
---
**Stratholme.**  That dude had Deathchargers Reins.  I finally did farm it up after a few years of playing the game (maybe more than that, tbh...), but i remember him showing me the mount and telling me how rare it was.  Honestly, i dont even like the mount *that* much (looks nice for an undead horse, but im just not a fan of most Horde mounts).  Oh yeah, i was also a dumbass there and insisted on AoEing everything.  I feel kind of bad about that.
---
I know we went through other dungeons.  I think maybe Gnomer, SFK im pretty sure we did, maybe ST?, im pretty sure Scholo....but the ones i listed above are the ones that stick out.  
---
I cant wait to see them on level with other people my level and do the the 'hard'/'right' way!
---
I find so many news articles but none of the wowhead articles mention it now. I mean I the very well that active sub and that was the sole reason why I made the ticket in the first place.. I'll check webarchive if they've edited it out
---
The server is 3k max not the layer
---
My alt will be an undead rogue because their starting zone gives better access to linen cloth from 1-10 and I can send it to my troll priest for disenchanting into a wand. I'd prefer to have an orc rogue for the stun resist but meh, it's just an alt.
---
There is a classic-only package.
---
It costs the same as the retail-only package.
---
They both cost the same as the all-inclusive package.
---
If you go eat at a buffet and tell them you're only having the steak and mashed potatoes, you only want to be charged a fraction of the full price because you're not eating anything else, they'll laugh at you for an hour.
---
\&gt;If a Human Rogue that specs into weapon expertise has a total of 310 sword skill is that down to 4% hit needed?  That seems very low.  
---
Probably not. The first 4 points of weapon skill are worth 0.2% hit chance each. The 5th point is worth 1.2% hit, **and** reduces the crit cap by 1%, so that's how we get from 9% needed to 6% needed.
---
The tables I've seen suggest that further weapon skill is only worth 0.1% chance to hit per point, so your 310 rogue would still need 6% hit (cause if he got 5% hit he'd still have 0.5% chance to miss). A 315 rogue would need 5% hit.
---
They already said they do not want multiple world bosses for the same server. 
---
There are plenty of solutions available. They can always open up more servers or give transfers off the very large servers.
---
Private servers, although flawed, are at least a good basis to start with, since we don‚Äôt have full access to all of the source data. Private servers (generally) try to keep it  as close to the real experience as they can, but sometimes they have to take some artistic license and try to fill in gaps with common sense. Do they fuck up? Sure. But it‚Äôs better than nothing. People just have to be mindful that its not 100% accurate (which no one with a brain has ever denied, and they freely admit their info can be off).
---
Yes at phase two
---
If your guild has enough healers or strong enough healers and you don't have enough dedicated DPS, a ret with Nightfall brings the nightfall debuff, plus another pally buff, plus loh, plus bop/sac, plus DI, plus some more damage vs more unnecessary healing.   You don't even need 40 people for the 40 man raids, so if you're already overhealing bossfights and not running out of mana, but still want the other things a pally brings, it's asinine to not bring a ret or prot just b/c you don't like them.  It does have a place, just not in every guild or situation.

I only got 2 days paid leave for my daughter being born, I could have taken 5 weeks but they would be without pay.. my wife gets maternity leave at like 70% for a year but it's for her to use not me..

Yep you got me bro, I'm totally full of shit.

If pet control is working as inteded you can protect your pet from most stuff by positioning it with the stay and passive commands to basically play a mini melee class which obviously requires you to keep an eye out on their mechanics. 
---
For example on Ragnaros you can have your pet *stay* on the melee safe spot and use *passive* when knockback is imminent, just like all the other melee dps.
---
Priest gets some spell damage from spirit (21/30/0 is the default priest spec).  This is useful early on, before you would have a decent off-spec dps set of gear.  It will probably hold true in the long run, but you will need to get vast amounts of water from a friendly mage before you go farming.
---
There are two main druid healing specs, moonglow and swiftmend.  You might think that mooglow spec would be okay for damage, but the talents that you take in the balance tree don't actually help that much for farming.  With a good set of damage gear you might be able to farm a bit, but it's probably worse than priest.  Swiftmend druid is terrible for farming, your best bet is to wear a feral set and use catform.
---
A lot of people might suggest druid hotw spec.  This is going to be a better farmer in cat gear.  It is inferior as a healer though, but that doesn't always matter to people.
---
Holy paladin is terrible for farming.
---
I'm taking off two weeks. I plan to get up at 2am each day to avoid the worst of the crowds and play until I drop.
---
I dunno about them, but I always rebind zoom in/out to alt+mousewheel up/down.
---
I'm not particularly interested in cat dps (but bear off-tanking seems fun) but I thought the HOTW spec had to choose between the cat and bear talents?
---
They've made it clear: one sub only that includes Retail and Classic. Doesn't mean you have to install retail. Classic and retail will be separate games.
---
Indeed. However, lets say someone is on the fence between a Troll Mage and Undead Mage. They want the best for PVE, but in their mind, they want to play undead.
---
And someone says;
---
Well, troll might be better, but you need to be on low hp to even gain something from the troll haste.. 
---
The undead will be better on fights with fear, as it interrupts and you can cast more spells than you otherwise would. 
---
So really, dont sweat it. Guides will say troll, but the difference is so so so low that it wont matter. 
---
-------------
---
They are like, ah fuck yeah, someone confirmed what I wanted, now I feel safe picking undead.
---
I've booked two off
---
Fixed!
---
Love love love this art style.
---
The burning crusade arrive prior to the AQ gates opening. 
---
The old gods are pissed that the legion has arrived. War ensues. Players are forced to support one of two cross-faction forces, similar to scryer and aldor. Except one fights against the old gods, thinking them to be the greater threat and will turn on the legion after the old gods are dead, and the other one is the opposite.
---
Thrall and Jaina devise a way, with Illidans help, to have the big bads wipe each other out. Final raid boss could be c'thun AND KJ, where they're fighting each other and you at the same time, and you have to kill them at the same time so they can't take the other's power.
---
Was the Mage officer and at the end of raids we would make a portal to IF for everyone and I would stack Darn on it... would usually get at least 1 person that would say "Damnit Jack..." always made my immature self laugh. 
---
Or use snowballs in raid when they had the knockdown but never knew who threw them, did it during bosses we had on farm mode to the main healers or the GM when he was going to loot so it would take longer to get there. Sometimes the MT right when they were about to charge. Harmless but annoying and also funny.. we had to have a "guild meeting" because a few people and me would make the raids lag and it wasn't a good look to have an Officer pulling "pranks" during raid hours. 
---
I made a horde rogue friend who was guildless and known for ganking and him and I would go gank people together.. Not really a prank but funny to me.
---
You have to give up a reason why you take off?
---
I remember early Paladins ranking on me for getting my charger after Scholo was made a 5-man since they had to do it with 5 Paladins when it was tuned for 10 people.
---
I recently had this conversation with a GM on the live servers, its upto you to decide if it qualifies! :)

Anyway, have a nice day friends!
---
What in Tarnation did I just read?
---
I'd like to participate but by sabotaging it - I don't want my PVP rivals running around in AQ gear.
---
Elv + weakaura + any auction addon + threat meter. That's it for me, I think. Depends on how much of the elv functionality will be transfered from its retail version.
---
I'll be playing druid so probably there's some QoL addons for druids that I don't know about, those as well.
---
Yeah. So what?
---
Because he wanted to brag about speed leveling in a beta where you are being trusted to test. Blizzard really dropped the ball on invites.
---
Thank you!
---
Thing I don't get about someone your age is why complain or even watch streamers that you dislike? Why not just change to one of the many you do prefer and leave it at that? 
---
What is the point of this post? attention? hop on the streamer bash train? You're 40+ ffs, if there's something you don't like, just simply move on.
---
Yeah, and ret is viable for everything in the game simply because every raid at least until naxx can be cleared with like 30-35 people, and virtually NO bosses require perfectly optimal min-max dps.
---
Absolutely. It will be a magic journey.
---
I know right? So casual...
---
It's fixed now :)
---
Theres going to be servers with massive populations way over 3k come phase two. How do we fix it ? Transfers ? Ques etc
---
Well, that's something!
---
I didn't expect many people to share my opinion so I'm ok with all the reactions.
---
Hunter Weapon.
---
I'm excited we won't see as many character names ending with "lol" or "qt"
---
Gonna try for 6 to 8 hours a day, longer on weekends. Only have 7 days left the year, going to use one to stack a holiday this summer for outdoors, then maybe two to stack on labor day weekend which would give me 5 days.
---
Ah I see, thanks for the reply!
---
arms+resto.
---
yes, warlock MT the new meta
---
ZF is bloody awful if your group doesn't have adequate CC and stuff. 
---
That's what made it so good, but I legitimately would get stuck in there for entire afternoons...4 hours sometimes.
---
I've had a similar, i started in bc and i hit my PvP peak in wrath and cata all while listening to the same playlist that i had made on some website that doesn't even exist anymore. To this day if i hear those songs in a particular order i flash back to my rogues assasination rotation and i try hitting my keybinds, no matter what im doing or where i am.
---
What the hell
---
Shadowpriests and mages can.  Shadowpriests get 10% from a talent, and mages get 6%, plus 1% for each ZG enchant so they only have to find 8% from gear itself.
---
its like you got 2 friends A+B but you only take money from A . So B passes his money to A so that A could hand it to you. 
---
.
---
Now its fine right?
---
Well I already have actual vacations planned for this year so I might take a sick day or something. Probably not on the actual launch day though. I'll let all the no lifers clear out of the starting zone first.
---
Lol screw you man. I /wave at Horde when I'm questing on my Paladin on a PvE server. I'm absolutely trash at PvP and most of the time people engage you when you pull a mob or are drinking/eating after a fight. Getting ganked sucks. I'm not about it. I'm just a care bear all the way through. Love it.
---
I was actually noticing my pet getting rez'd by the spirit healer and gaining happiness in bgs and I have no memory of that being a thing in vanilla.
---
&gt; 11 feign trap has an INSANE delay sometimes with pet attacking/pet being put on passive, seems related to combat not dropping reliably when feigning in PvP
---
I swear this seems to be working as intended. I remember not using my pet in bgs because I'd go to feign and my pet would keep me combat locked. I vaguely remember hunters raging about it on the forums but 15 years is too long of a time frame for my memory.
---
HotW spec. Can tank dungeons, can heal raids, can pvp.
---
Yeah, I thought about this as well. I'll probably go for a very specific collection with a small chance to run into it by accident, likely a lot of synthwave. [Odysseus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoTj-pZgZZ8DInOXSSLMmA) is a gold mine.
---
&gt;that any item I will ever need from BS can be bought in AH, therefore I will rather make a profession, that will actually make me money
---
any item I will ever need from BS can be bought in AH... rather make a profession, that will actually make me money.
---
Hmmm. Maybe you could make money by putting those items on the AH for others to buy.
---
Well, I just wanted to vent.
---
Of course I stopped watching some channels that I loved in the past because people either turned out to be frauds or the quality of their content deteriorated to a point where I just couldn't take it anymore.
---
Thank you! Could you post and/or DM me the original files without Imgur compression? Going to get these printed üòÉ
---
Would this cause issues in wpvp? I started losing interest in wow when phasing became a thing. 
---
My only reference was the stress test in arathi highlands where the raids couldn't see each other and that was depressing to me.
---
Ret pallys won't really take any loot that others need for progression, thouh.  Pally T1, T2, and T2.5 are all fantastic for ret (and T2 in particular is really damn good for prot also) and they are pretty trash for Holy.  Only other thing they need is a good 2h which aren't used for raid DPS really anyway.  Both trinkets come from pre-raid stuff.  One ring comes from AV, other ring and cloak prebis is fine for a long, long time.  They may need a neck at some point.
---
Why would they start charging people *less* money to play the game..? The point of the 2-in-1 sub is that they know people are going to pay it regardless of which version they want to play, but if you like both, you get both. Also handy for marketing when they can just say "X world of warcraft subscriptions total".
---
Also, in this day and age, if you can afford a computer and an internet connection, you can afford a WoW sub. It's super cheap considering the time you'll get out of it. It costs me more to go to the theater once than to play WoW for a month.
---
yeah and this might be one of the reasons you dont want an early shadowpriest also.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
I can't get those stupid faces out of my head.
---
Priest with decent gear can holy nova farm dire maul plants for good gold, or lower level instances for cloth and disenchant stuff.
---
Paladin with damage reflect and prot spec can AOE farm really well, or holy paladin with gear and consecration same thing really.
---
These 2 are the best farmers healer wise, druids are good for gathering and open world farming and can AoE farm similarly but not as efficient.
---
Shamans are dead last here.
---
Ahhh honoured gives 10% discount, yeah that would do it. Is it worth putting the reputation-based discounts for the epic mounts on the page? Everyone will be honoured with the relevant faction by the time they hit 60 or gain exalted in order to buy them.
---
&gt;  that any item I will ever need from BS can be bought in AH 
---
And I will be the one who sells it.
---
I am SO HAPPY that people disregard BS as gold making profession. Really. Going to be (again) the richest player on my server.
---
Blacksmithing sux people ! DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT choose Blacksmithing !
---
Oh boy, let me tell you all about starting. I'm a pro.
---
1. We have a warlock and two support staff ready to summon anyone out to Duke Hydraxis in Azshara.
---
2. We have a warlock and two support staff ready to summon anyone out to Silithus.
---
3. This group will also be AoE farming the elementals you have to kill, you'll just join their group, get your 30 kills, and leave.
---
4. We have another warlock and two support staff ready to summon you to EPL to kill the 12 elementals there.
---
5. We have a team farming UBRS (this is my job at 60 as there are 12 pieces of gear from this instance for me). You get in, kill the first boss, get out.
---
Once at least 7 people have reached this step:
---
1. We have another 3-man team summoning for attunement.
---
2. 15 hours before raid reset, we'll start killing all the MC trash for the quest step and reputation.
---
3. Since we're not saved to the instance yet, we'll reset and keep farming trash until the 7+ are honored. (Hopefully plenty of BoE Epics!)
---
4. The 7+ get summoned back to Azshara and then back to MC.
---
5. We clear up to Majordomo.
---
6. The 7+ get summoned back to Azshara and then back to MC.
---
7. We kill Majordomo and Rag.
---
All in all, there's about 100 people committed to various parts of this massive plan.
---
I know but its funny when ppl still try to argue they dont... and then you open twitch and see even new streamers getting the beta invite in the past few days after they stated in the forums that little to no invites were going to happen in a short future...
---
Not everyone can afford to actually travel somewhere, but they still want to take their time off. I consider myself lucky to be taking two international trips later this year. Sadly this leaves me with no extra vacation for playing classic WoW.
---
Source on that?
---
From my experiences with cats, you don‚Äôt even need to use catnip for them to fall asleep in odd places/poses. They do it naturally.
---
And it is HILARIOUS.
---
There will always be newer batches of alts who hit level cap and start raiding.
---
LOLOL 
---
Have you paid any attention to Blizzard for the last 15 years? The monthly fee hasn't reduced. Why on earth would they offer a break for people who think they are too good for retail?
---
As long as you have enough mana you can AoE 4-5 mobs down which is basically the amount of mobs another healer class can kill before going oom
---
The price hasn‚Äôt changed in 14 years. With inflation you are actually already receiving a discount and access to retail. It‚Äôs win win.
---
Many people here spewing bullshit. The shaman caster 1h weapon is ballin if you want to push for it. The shields not so much, but you can look elsewhere for a shield such as red dragonscale shield. They still have a ton of armor which is nice. 
---
The shaman legs are extremely good, and I believe the boots are nice as well. The gloves you can pass on but the blue pvp gloves are nice, as is t1 gloves. The chest piece on shaman has a fuckload of stamina and I believe spell crit. That is absolutely fantastic. I also see players use the helm because it also has a fuckload of stamina and I believe spell crit as well. So those 4 pieces can definitely be worth it. 
---
People over here acting like a shaman with a ton of hp is nothing, shamans could just shock you to death when they‚Äôre rocking a 5k health pool and a ton of armor. 
---
I would try out what you want on a special server if you want to PM me. It will allow you to customize a shaman with all the gear you‚Äôd ever want and then test it out.
---
Can you rig a sleep tracker up to show your heartbeat on screen?
---
That makes no sense. The sub is $15 and has been that way since Vanilla. Its a steal.
---
Later, Kael'Thas helps Illidan track down Arthas and put him in the ground. As Illidan is standing over Arthas's broken body, Kael'Thas stabs him in the back and takes the Crown, becoming the new Lich King. 
---
Meanwhile, Jaina and Thrall are recruiting the dragonflights to lead a preemptive attack on 'ole DW, who Thrall accidentally found on a spirit quest. Jaina gets trapped in a time loop by the Infinite Dragonflight, and only Thralls love can break her out. Thrall and Alexstrasza team up to bring the infinite dragonflight to heel, and Thrall and Alexstrasza find a way to transform a hero into a mighty dragon, and they nominate Cairne, whom they place over the Infinite Dragonflight. They tackle DW before he can fully recover. Cairne, however, goes mad with the time paradox issues of his dragonflight and becomes the new big bad.
---
Cairne and Kael'thas go HAM on the world.
---
Soda is not some top notch classic pvp player, above average at best.
---
&gt; the Blizzard team chose to co-develop the project with Animation Magic, a subdivision of Capitol responsible for the CD-i games from The Legend of Zelda series
---
lol whoopsie!
---
Tanking 5 mans isn't hard as prot pally and can get through them without issue. Same goes for a ret paladin.
---
Incorrect analogy. If there is a restaurant with one food item at $15 and you add a second one, why should you be forced to get the first item in order to get the second one free when the values are obviously different? You could add a system where you pay $15 for both OR $7.50 (or any price) for the newly released second item so that people have more options to create more revenue
---
You have 2 kind of streamers : the one with a likeable personality (at least likeable by their fan base) that usually have low skill then you have the streamers with 0 charisma but with insane skill (Shroud).
---
I retired to be safe.
---
Yeah, it's 15 bucks a month for classic, and let's you play retail for free.
---
I think not. Basicaly, it is free now and somewhat a bonus to usual sub. If they make it saparate it will feel weird. So I doubt it.
---
Thunderfury is not a fury weapon, This thing is the bis item in the hands of your tanks because of how much Threat it produces. The only way to obtain a Thunderfury is going to main tank for a guild or run the guild and be a bad GM that takes thunderfury over a main tank. Either way the likely hood of you getting one is slim to non.
---
It is on the page, I'm explaining discount types all the way on top.
---
I have no idea what servers you've played on, but I've followed the top raiding scene in the past 3 big servers and I've never seen a horde player with an alliance buff, ever. I've seen plenty of alliance with horde buffs, but never the opposite.
---
In the USA we celebrate Christmas eve and say merry Christmas on the 24th.
---
2 weeks off for me
---
I played a cat druid in vanilla and i'm *this* fucking close to doing it again. Just for the feels, even though i should know better this time around.
---
Ret pally is fine when you tryhard and help out your guild constantly.  Ret pally is terrible when you dont try, dont bring pots, lack dedication and knowledge... so probably 4/5 ret pallies you meet, will not understand what it takes to be a true ret.
---
I'm torn on this one. Do I listen to the same music or do I make new connections? 
---
At ease is probably the right expression. I feel the same way, I was mostly happy about the discovery.
---
Damn, you guys are going hard as fuck. Can I join your guild and raid with your alts?
---
Sure thing! [Here you go](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t2Glifcgx8lJRuwcNoZMaDYxQYt93cWe)
---
Are you and your friends that cheap?
---
The only people who play undead are mediocre shitters or good mages.
---
Everyone remotely good is Orc, no need to worry.
---
And where it matters, premade, the undead rogue is not really a problem for you.
---
Classes you may be afraid of due to undead will be more afraid of you, such as a tier 3 best in slot warrior, when you run around in aq40/naxx gear (or equal BiS at time of progression) in soul link spec with a void walker out. No one dares touch a geared SL warlock, it's a tough mountain to climb and not worth it.
---
it will there is 3 items, that might make it into new list:   
---
**Savage Gladiator Chain** (no defense on it)   
---
**Brigam Girdle** (now with 1% hit)  
---
**Bloodmail Boots** (now with 1% hit)
---
Yes. Queues and transfers just like before
---
What? Addons were available since Beta...
---
Taking the two days off following the release. The following Monday is a holiday for me so i'll have the long weekend to play too. Then i'm taking random Mondays off for those sweet short weeks/long weekends. That way I can work off the rested exp instead of playing all day, won't have to worry about work building up, and i'm still free to stop taking those days if I hit 60 early rather than having to take them all at once.
---
He's dead and extremely drunk?
---
It doesn't matter if you skin 1 mob your entire way to 60 or 8000. The gold per hour stays the same. The only thing that increases is how many mobs you actually skin, meaning how many minutes you actually are skinning, meaning how much gold you actually make.
---
&gt; I'd say a more useful stat is what i calculated from your numbers, you loot on average ~1 silver more per mob you kill if you pick up skinning than if you hadn't.
---
By that metric, it's 163g 39s...
---
To the people who claim leveling a warrior is hard:
---
It sure is... if its your first character. But if you already have a level 60 with a bit of gold, bank rolling the warrior make a HUGE difference. Purchasing the scarlet set for a early 30s warrior is a game changer. Same with Executioner's Cleaver or just keeping the weapon as current as possible.
---
My point is that you can keep the current planned price but add another lower, singular option which could potentially bring more people in
---
LOLOL nobody wants to play retail bud.
---
Viable can either be literal, or more commonly "what most raids tolerate".
---
If your spec makes it noticeably harder to complete a fight, that means it can be the difference between a win or a wipe. If it makes that difference, it's not viable in that raid.
---
Rogues are still well within normal ranges, and will gear up faster normalising meters even further.
---
The hunter comment is just funny because a raid without 2-3 hunters isn't viable due to lost tranq. (And much more than that past early raids is genuinely unviable oftentimes)
---
Making no sense to bring into high end PvE is not the same as being useless to the game. Plenty of specs thrive in PvP, help healers level, or just add variety to the game.
---
What faces?
---
Im going to give you a little advice, take it or leave it: in life you have to come to realize your own limits. If you enjoy something, regardless of what it is, and then hit a point in which you stop enjoying it, stop taking part, but come back at another time because clearly there was something there for you at some point. Find something else in the meantime, its 2019 and there's something for everyone out there. Take some responsibility for the things you enjoy and your own happiness.
---
Ew no thrall is far too classy for that
---
Druid pairs well with almost any class in vanilla pvp.
---
The goal is to reduce it to just one layer (over possibly multiple host servers) after the rush of launch is over. Which for all intents and purposes will be like you remember vanilla with just one continuous world. Kinda like how the beta (no-layering) is compared to the stress tests (testing layers).
---
There is no way to tell without an exact simulation or math that is sore complex... There are way too many variables, like your current crit chance with buffs (are you crit capped?), your current amount of AP, your current weapon dps, current weapon damage regardless of speed, weapon skill and more. 
---
Still, I will try to help. I can give you a floor aka. Absolute minimum for how good it is that is easy to calculate:
---
- It is ALWAYS better than 1% damage increase. This is easy to prove because a 1 "percentpoint" increase on something that is less than 100 percent is more than 1%.
---
- You also know that for warriors every 7 strength equals 14 AP equals 1DPS. 
---
I will do the math from here and edit my post in like 10 min.. Hold on
---
How could you? We only do this for speedruns once a month when the darkmoon faire is available. If you're not in our raids, you won't see it.
---
Ill probably have about 4-5 days left by that time.  I think my strategy is honestly going to be to take later in that week off (Thursday/Friday?) and then maybe do the same thing the following week.
---
I dont want to get too awfully burned out right away, and i assume leveling zones are going to be a clusterfuck for at least the first couple days.  Ill play at night (4-5ish hours) on other days, but ill wait a bit to really no life it.
---
i plan on aggressively refreshing this sub on launch day as i live vicariously through those that are already playing until i can get home from work. 
---
Just like back in the day when i was working during the summers and waiting until i get home on patch days.
---
I was playing Lineage 2 before joining in WoW Classic and Lineage 2 didn't have much quests and their rewards were crap - everyone basically just did class transfer quests to advance to your next class and that's it. It was mob grind 24/7.
---
So when I created my first char - orc warlock - I did just that, grinded mobs to 18 and ignored all quests. I only did pet quests as I saw them as those mandatory class transfer quests in Lineage 2.
---
And then after seeing all these exclamation marks for so long and thinking "wow there's a lot of quests" I checked one quest from some quest giver - green item reward that was so much better than my white/gray one, it had stats and shit. I was amazed - free gear! Free good gear! In Lineage 2 you had to grind gold (adena) and buy it (low to mid tier gear) and craft hi tier gear. And exp awarded was like two bars!
---
Immediately rerolled new char - troll hunter - and started doing all quests I could find. 
---
Leveling was much easier and quicker.
---
Trollgodx was awesome...i laught so hard when he was sitting on totems hahahaha...i enjoyed more seeing him trolling and the tears than the tournament
---
Thank you! Playlist suggestions are always welcome.
---
I think WA allows you to track stacks.  I havent actually made any in quite some time, though.
---
The Barrens is a Horde zone, you won‚Äòt see any gankimg there unless some nubies attack skull marked yellow bars lol.
---
It‚Äòs true though, I remember being ganked quite a few times leveling in duskwood.
---
Can‚Äòt confirm the STV level though.
---
And still, there‚Äòs always at least 1 lvl 60 Ally in STM.
---
I think this will make orc warriors significantly more important 305 axes helps alot, after that there are a few items that can help lower parry that a tank could use. 
---
Basically with the parry confirmation weaponskill becomes a high priority for tanks
---
Layering allows for dynamic servers which can be dynamically priced. As far as I know, they run their cloud servers on AWS where the price is tied to the consumption. It's much cheaper for them to pay per consumption instead of handling massive static servers.
---
They have already stated that each layer is going to be around the size of a typical server back in 2004-2006. It's obviously possible for there to be less players, but they aren't doing that.
---
gamers : I want the real original experience, when I didn't know shit and where to go, and explored
---
also gamers : You need 20 add-ons minimum for quests, UI, recount etc. :')
---
I will get Auctionator or Auctioneer depending on if Auctionator gets a revamp, and maybe Questie after I finish leveling my first char. For auctioning it's quite mandatory indeed, else it takes hours... Maybe a mail add-on as well, other than that I like the current interface
---
...It's a joke, hakuna your tatas.
---
So you want to play Vanilla for less than it was 15 years ago?
---
Hey i use a pedal too! Mine is a modifier set to Alt.
---
I prefer an item to be crafted by a guildmate, but if thats not available ... I dont care at all tbh.
---
wow. the minimum vacation per year by law is 2 weeks where i live.
---
You wanted 'no change' right ? ;-)
---
Lots of scarab lords still play, and there‚Äôs a bunch of them post-wrath
---
But what if all these new members have a diffrent idea for what should come after Naxx ?
---
Its pretty hard to get them and BS is a huge gold sink early on. Yes, once you get that far. Its the same with enchanting. There are better options tho
---
yea
---
How was your experience?
---
I'm going out of town during release. Family &gt; WoW. Then I'll play casually when I get back.
---
ty!
---
Sorry I just read about the beta part.
---
Which I must say though is not really represantative though, since there‚Äòs nothing really to do at some point in lvl 30.
---
Totally agree, that's why I stopped watching quite a few channels.
---
But I still wanted to voice my opinion on the topic which should be allowed, right?
---
Wtf does this have to do with classic wow?
---
Awesome :D
---
You are forgetting something incredibly important. A companies TOS is subject to their judgement. If a company feels something is on the fringe but profitable, they may decide to leave it alone. That's business. Asmon in particular is rivaling Ninja right now, that's no joke for a 15 year old game.
---
I'm mostly being dramatic
---
"Honey, what are you doing?" :)
---
To be fair, this is a sub reddit about a game that's coming out soon, not about a streamer's personal life.
---
It's a mystery. I always wondered if he meant drunk or angry.
---
Hey!
---
Our guild used bigwigs in vanilla and most other guilds did too, early on we used custom made macros like for ebonroc taunt.
---
HOWEVER, Deadly Boss Mods used to be called "La Vendetta Boss Mods" and has existed since at least August 2006
---
Joining a guild and raiding as Arms warrior, but refusing to go Prot all the way into Naxx and BC. 
---
Wait, that wasn't a prank..
---
Gladly and every single one I see.
---
I will be bingeing audio books while I lvl. They will keep my brain engaged while let me mentally automate my progression.
---
Thanks! Blizzard artists have been a big influence of mine
---
In casual guilds the most hardcore tank will get it.
---
In hardcore guilds the most hardcore of the hardcore will get it.
---
Well it feels more alive because it makes it more dangerous, it makes the factions seem like they matter more, so in my opinion its more alive that way, theres more pride in your faction and puts a more competition between them, however I do understand what youre saying and it has happened to me in the past, this is why I'm on the fence.
---
/r/cursedimages
---
Because it is not WoW related, this is his personal life.
---
What does his real life company have anything to do with world of war craft??? Who gives a shit
---
This.
---
I'm curious if there is a way for alliance to use the teleporter somehow.
---
I am assuming it is horde only unfortunately.
---
I‚Äôm not telling you what to do or what to share, I‚Äôm just saying for you, you could be off enjoying something else instead of pouring time into posting about something you don‚Äôt like.
---
Be prepared to grind between moving to new zones. Quests alone won't be enough to level you up, grinding will be required.
---
The Classic Only package is to get a sub and not buy the retail game.
---
I mean, there's a reason Goth and Seuche  always play Undead warlock. Fear is just a more dangerous CC than stuns. Are you really afraid of stuns outside of kidney shot? I think I'll take the trade on WotF'ing priest, warlock and warrior fears instead of maybe resisting a    rogue stun.
---
Phasing won't exist by phase 2 and this has been stated by the devs. Even if the drop off is lower than expected, I'm sure the devs are prepared, the fact that you think you know more on the issue speaks for itself.
---
You really think nothing anyone does in real life matters?
---
About the paladin, depends on what you farm. If you want to farm DME you can go 20/31/0 and still heal instances. To go deep into holy ofc brings your ability to farm down quite a bit. And when it comes to farming casters or stronger mobs then paladin is quite bad.
---
If you are honestly complaining about paying $15 a month (a little over than .50 cents a day) I think you have bigger issues to worry about.
---
You clearly didnt understand my post if you think im "moaning about casuals". I also like how putoff you are by kid, it means I got my point across.
---
There‚Äôs not necessarily one per realm either. You could theoretically have a whole bunch of them.
---
kinda... the best talents actually effect both :)  This is the full hybrid build I am talking about:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0zZxxhscrzLVE00xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0zZxxhscrzLVE00xo)  
---
(The single Point in Natures Grasp makes you excellent in PvP too.. if you want to focus on PvE you put a 5th point in Heart of the Wild.)
---
So its more the utility, small 1%ers that you make a choice. Aka.. you want Improved shred if you want to maxemize cat dps.. and you want more Thick Hide if you really like Bear tanking.
---
You're not getting invited.
---
I'm not sure there's a big difference between a coma and Frostsaber reputation grinding. I have no specific memories of the Frostsaber grind, just that it took a while.
---
Any he only seems to drop his wand when I'm not a caster.
---
I took 2 1/2 weeks off
---
It gets capped and new servers are introduced? This literally already happened in vanilla.
---
These people want to specifically play an MMO because that's the genre that interests them. Its the best value for that type of experience they want. 
---
If I'm an MMO enthusiast, I'm not going to stop playing an MMO because a F2P MOBA provides exponentially more entertainment per dollar than I could ever want. If that was the case, no one would buy traditional AAA video games in favor for f2p titles.
---
People look humans more than gnomes. Some people choose aesthetics rather than min/maxing stuff.
---
I'm at work and have some time to burn. 
---
And it seems like this topic has sparked a discussion which is a win in my book.
---
No one cares.
---
&gt;Warlocks have Seduce
---
Broken by WOTF too \^\^
---
And try hards will have the BS trinket, 30s anti-fear ...
---
I think the best thing for you is to come to the Horde side, we'll be nice :-)
---
Nope, the entire point was to keep it on the normal sub to inflate sub numbers to the higher ups so that BfA looks like lesa of a flop. Splitting the subs would make them look worse.
---
But vanilla cost this much when it first released anyway? Why would they charge less for it now, especially after investing so much in bringing it back? Honestly I had expected vanilla to be an additional $15 sub on top of the $15 retail sub, so the fact that it‚Äôs basically ‚Äúbuy one, get the other free‚Äù is pretty cool
---
Escape artist and the minor int buff make gnome a better choice but some people don‚Äôt enjoy looking at the characters models. That‚Äôs why I chose to play a human warlock.
---
Play whatever you‚Äôd like.
---
That's the one I ran the most with my guild back in the day. I love that instance.
---
Oh shit I must have subbed to the tipsout reddit not the classic wow reddit.
---
Then it's great, more ideas for blizzard.
---
Can't see swanky armor as well on a shorty
---
OP is creating a literal simulation of trolling in trade chat. Change my mind.
---
Humans don‚Äôt have to swim in puddles, literally. That said, I still prefer gnome. 
---
Humans are also the most common race in both Horde or Alliance regardless of class.
---
I love the Tanaris theme. It's what's played in Wailing Caverns and Ahn'Qiraj.
---
Man idk I think color would take away from this kind of thing. Great job post more if you got em.
---
wennot
---
My guild in vanilla cleared MC on a weekly basis for a full year just to make a single TF for our main tank. Don't hold your breath.
---
Yep. Gotta get some more brain damage. 
---
It's definitely a drug.
---
It's not limited to one per realm.  Anyone that rings the gong in time can get it...it's just usually only one or two per faction because of the massive effort involved.
---
Why would any original holders of it get upset? Players now will have to go through the entire process they went through during Vanilla.
---
Those who get it in Classic won't be able to display the title on their retail character as everything is separate so I don't see how this has any impact on anyone.
---
I am afraid to a certain extent that this new reality will hinder the gaming experience.  At a minimum, I will have to try to find a realm without streamers because I think their presence will be a detriment to progression, balance and overall enjoyment.
---
I hope I am wrong but just go watch clips of streamers and their behaviors (GIVE ME THE GLAIVE!!!! or REEEE! over a lost mount) to grasp the impact of those players.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true# there you go
---
You can do almost anything outside of premade PvP and high end PvE. Those are the things people actually care about at this point though.
---
You just said it‚Äôs his parents company...
---
It's almost like the majority of society are good people and don't like dealing with mean/evil/frustrating people. Fucking shocker.
---
But with a paladin if you attack faster you can proc it more.
---
So it would only apply to abilities that do an instant hit, which paladins don't have. 
---
For hunters you do weapon hit plus some damag with melee skills although since you would usually just get in 1 hit then slow your target and run away so slower is better for that one hit.
---
Yaaaaaaa, except addons where a huge part of the game even during vanilla
---
That's just how the mount holders usually are called. Sounds better than any alternative IMO, so they might not be referring to the title (that's what I'm doing atleast)
---
Technically you could, although it sounds like it's capped at 5 man in the beta (not sure if that's intentional or a bug). I literally never knew anyone who ran a 10 man leveling dungeon during vanilla though, since you can't complete quests.
---
This is almost /r/lostredditors shit. We're here to talk about the game.
---
You really think that's what that poster said?
---
That was most certainly not me! I swear!
---
I would disagree with that.
---
There's a large bump in demand right now as people can't play but are thinking about their past with the game. Most likely it will come back down soon after release. At least for a period.
---
I'd hope that people look more like humans than gnomes.
---
The most memorable and nostalgic track is the ghost run composition. It's simply called *Graveyard*. It's entirely because I spent so much time corpse running that the ethereal choir is burned onto my hippocampus with a Blizzard brand.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwMic-KXQlY
---
I know its an uncommon one that some people just dislike. There was something magical about it man. I spent so much time leveling in 1k needles, barrens, durotar, and the salt flats that when I actually got here I felt l discovered some other different world. I was about 20 levels too low but it was fun as hell to discover - felt like an oasis.
---
It matters. This is just a classic wow sub. Why should we discuss his affairs with his own company? If they comitted fraud, they should go to jail.
---
This is certainly not the place to discuss this.
---
Priests are hilarious, but I've only really ever seen elitist shit flinging festivals between warriors. Maybe im just lucky lol.
---
Not in this sub. This is about wow not some shady business dealings.
---
That he was an officer of, that's a big part of the company
---
"Who gives a shit?"
---
no, i don't think people come to the classic wow subreddit to hear about some streamers personal problems.  Difference between not caring and not being relavent to the page.
---
What do you consider leisurely? 1.5 months to 60 is not really leisurely, that's more than 2 hours a day, every day, assuming extremely efficient time to 60.
---
That's actually a pretty great idea, thank you! No idea why I hadn't thought of it before, but I'll definitely do that this time around.
---
true i do remember that as well... but that may have been early vanilla only we'll have to look at patch notes...
---
Resubbing for a slim chance to get into beta is pretty stupid. Don‚Äôt feel bad for people who did it and didn‚Äôt get in üòÇ
---
Scholomance for the damn magister's shoulders.
---
To be fair, no one knows those numbers and blizzard hasn't shared them altho they have acknowledge that they have targeted numbers.
---
They have a target pop for early days for layering.
---
They have a target pop for the entire server. 
---
They will have ways of gauging interest before launch to more accurately predict those numbers( like realm list and name reserve before release.)
---
You're trying to make an issue of a problem that doesn't exist with some made up numbers of your own.
---
Who the fuck is that guy, why the fuck should i care if he creates content (wtf is that even mean? (apperantly recording yourself playing some1 else creation is nowadays regarded as creating somthing lol?) and how the fuck does it means anything about the game
---
A sever will gave multiple layers with a cap of 3k per layer, what if after phase 1 there are still server with 3 or more layers full ?
---
are they going to merge all 3 layers and make a 9k server?
---
are they gona make a new server ?
---
Blizzard always makes solution to a problem that makes more problems later on.
---
I didnt check the website but when logging into the game it has wow 1 or wow 5 for me to choose from. Previously with the stress test it was wow 1 and wow 4. 4 was my stress test account and now 5 is the actual beta. If this helps with your question.
---
Rule number 1. Content must relate to classic wow. 
---
Why don‚Äôt we start going through your personal life and put it on the internet for everyone to talk about.
---
When songs come on that I used to listen to grinding back from when WoW launched it brings me right back, it's crazy.
---
I took Tuesday and Wednesday off. I'll be "working from home" Thursday and Friday. Lol.
---
I do have a gaming friend that works at blizzard and I asked if he could help when the beta launched. He said he would try but it was really hard to get it. Maybe he made something happen. Havnt spoken with him yet.
---
I'm just excited about playing druid.
---
Rule 1:  Content must be related to WoW: Classic
---
If it was beta for a new game, I would consider playing. But playing a beta from a 15 year old game which even reset your progress on launch. Never understand that fun
---
And it‚Äôs gone.
---
1. Nothing to do with Classic WoW
---
2. Who gives a shiny shit
---
Exactly why i made this post. I only know the information i know. Appreciate the input deadzors
---
Yeah this is the most likely scenario
---
They may.
---
Whatever their drive to finally put the resources in for Classic, it is the ultimate post-retail cash cow. I figure there will be a time in the future where having a Classic Only option for slightly cheaper will be pushed to draw more people. At some point the metrics will show it to be more profitable.
---
They have a HUGE benefit with Classic that they didn't have back when it was the latest and greatest in that the entire premise of Classic is that it's in its original state and not to be modified. This includes quirky bugs and interactions that at the time would be considered nuisances in need of patching. Not only are they not doing that, but it's basically demanded by the Classic community.
---
This being the case, the game is immediately thrust into a baseline maintenance mode. The primary concern for generating profits has nothing to do with promising new development because the entire purpose of this is that there won't be new development or changes (yes I understand the door is open for them to make new content in the Classic servers but you get the point). They have a product that for the most part will not change, so it's just a matter of assessing the basic economics rather than all these intangible potential of xpacs and such.
---
So... A human with 305/300 sword skill fighting a lvl 63 boss would require a 6% hit cap?
---
!RemindMe 84 days
---
This. I broke down and bought a game time card so I could mess around in retail (blood elf starting area or some other BC area that‚Äôs not too different post cataclysm) because I‚Äôm so damned excited for Classic. And then realized I am two expansions behind‚Äî not interested. I‚Äôll wait.
---
6pm on the 26th for east coast
---
Yup. Add to this that when the layers suddenly 'reshuffle' or whatever they call it : you will see mobs and nodes dissappear or reappear around you. If you are killing your way into a crowded cave congrats you're dead
---
True, or your ringtone
---
Not in here it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Why? Nothing even drops there. It's basically just for quests.
---
Could be early vanilla, I didn‚Äôt play hunter until late vanilla though. I also remember furious howl too...
---
what has that got to do with anything
---
People just didn't want to have to do a name change at any cost. silly
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gj47G2e1Jc
---
loop this during your level grind to ascend to a higher plane of existence
---
yes.
---
tanks are in the highest demand through the entire life of the game in my experiences. I played a resto druid and priest for about 5 years and always struggled to find tanks.
---
The real pros are the ones that invested in activisionblizzard and ruined modern wow creating a financial need for classic wow.
---
Alliance warlock
---
thats rough
---
Interesting, I'm not familiar with paladin aoe farming.
---
You're missing holy power from the holy tree, the rest doesn't really matter (another paladin can buff wisdom).  That's basically missing 5% mana efficiency and a little throughput, which would be really bad for any other healing class but might be acceptable for a well geared paladin.
---
Will these addons immediately work or do we have to wait for a couple days? Would love to know. I mean, some developers already updated them for the Beta.
---
I think Im going to get sick for a week on launch date. I can see my health future xD
---
They choose human because the only other choice is a fing Gnome *shudder*
---
Aye, didnt say impossible, just much harder. With a combination of larger hit boxes and melee leeway making the mob able to get 1 extra hit quite often.
---
I mean, it wasn't horrible. Mainly because i played fairly casually, i was too young to even consider maintaining a raiding schedule. It was an inconvenience at times for sure because not everyone wanted a cat in their groups. But i got to do an occasional weekend MC run and whatnot since you do need 40 people to fill the raid.
---
However, this time i around i have time to waste and my goal is definitely to step into Naxx. And i feel like picking a real class and spec combo is an essential step in that journey.
---
I was an alcoholic, so both RFC and WC are going to be very nostalgic
---
man we all knew hunters would be the most bugged but no one expected it to be this bad i bet!
---
Blackrock Depths, Blackfathom Deeps, and Sunken Temple are among my favorites.
---
Looking forward to the really long, sprawling dungeons.
---
I'm playing anyways and it's not about me or you. Why would blizzard want less people playing?
---
i added myself (mattymck#1928)
---
none of my friends are coming back for classic so im in need of some people to play with!
---
On my private server I went out of my way to have it crafted by a dude named strongest.
---
Yes! We need lots of people, even casuals are welcome. The guild is only serious business during pulls and speedruns, at every other moment, it's great and chill and hilarious. Most of us are in our 30's. And we go pretty hard at PVP too, at least wPVP. The guild leader once hated an alliance troll so much, he made 40 screenshots of killing someone in the guild mandatory homework before the next raid reset. They couldn't enter a contested zone without being camped.
---
Our plan is to split the alpha team into as many different MC and Ony raidIDs as possible before BWL hits so there's a lot more chances at loot. If we have 120 raiders, that's 3 to 6 MC clears a week.
---
But don't be discouraged, the alpha team has absolutely no loot priority over anyone else. We use Loot Lists, which you can read more about [here](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/). It's by far the most drama-free bias-free loot system ever devised. Not a single person has ever left the guild over loot. 
---
The alpha team also isn't really decided. It'll be the best -geared highest-performing most-dependable 40 raiders we have, regardless of whether they're officers or not.
---
Once we clear BWL on day one, we'll split the group up again and repeat.
---
The only other time the full alpha team gets together is during darkmoon faire. We get every single fucking buff imaginable (most people don't know there's a buff limit) and speedrun all the available raids. THIS is why we go so hardcore, it's all about shaving time off kills and clears. Onslaught was the first guild to kill Vael in under 45 seconds (no tank death) and then again in under 20 seconds.
---
Right now, applications are only being considered for those that have intentions of reaching 60 in time for the week one raid. But if all goes well, you'll hear about us again.
---
Ah, it‚Äôs spelled Krau, so RFK. Hence the confusion.
---
You can barely see what you're wearing as a gnome. Disgusting little halflings.
---
I totally relate to this, I still listen to mid 2000's metal in day to day life, and it takes me back to WoW when I was a teen hanging out with my buddies at 2am. I always get an urge to play whenever Breaking Benjamin or Disturbed pops up!
---
Still completely irrelevant to his wow content. It also doesn‚Äôt prove he did anything wrong.. you have no idea what his role in the company or his role in the fraud was. It could have been a lot, it could have none at all. Also, just anecdotal, but I have a position in my families company and don‚Äôt even really work there anymore.. he could be an officer because he‚Äôs family, not because of his role and responsibilities in the company..
---
Aesthetics mostly. I prefer alliance
---
Horde for pvp racials.
---
Also stormwind is just the best thing ever... Beats og / tb by far
---
Its gonna be 15$ 
---
congrats, now you have 1 game for 15$ instead of 2
---
actually it cost more in terms of value
---
inflation and all
---
Hi, /u/Talkurt
---
I don't know about you all, but despite the critique of spelling, this map is reminding me of zones and times I've had in wow long since gone.  I left in WotK and let me tell you, I haven't been as excited for a game to come out like this since the original Vanilla WoW itself.  A feat that only Elderscrolls games have achieved before.
---
Thanks for the post either way, it brought back some awesome world PvP memories.
---
Yeah you got me there 100% didnt think of that. Exactly why discussion is a good thing
---
Agreed, he‚Äôs  a liar and a disgrace to our community. Wotf breaks sheep gtfo
---
I simply loved the dungeons in Vanilla mostly because the first time I went through them I went with guildies who I had played other games with. The cameraderie and bonding you get .... 
---
What I do remember is getting lost an awful lot , especially if I had to do a solo corpse run. Even now I would probably get told not to nab it up
---
BRD , Strat UD have always been my favourites but I will run them all and enjoy it ...even Gnomer
---
!RemindMe 83 days
---
Im not a healthy or fun example and I advice no one to play like me.
---
I got 2 weeks off. Monday I'll sleep all day to at midnight when it releases ( EU ) I'll play for 26-28 hours. Thusday/wednesday night around 3 I'll go to bed for a 6 hours sleep. From 9:00 till 18:00 I'll play and than back to bed. The next 2 weeks I'll sleep between 17:00 and 1:00 to avoid prime-time.
---
Halfway tru my second week I'll be 60 and start working on Onyxia and Mc attunments while farming dungeons for pre-raid bis. Once I'll preraid bis geared somewhere in my 3th or 4th week I'll farm gold. And lots of gold. I still have skinning and mining atm. I'll level mining to 300 because I could not keep up during leveling. I'll buy the early mats for engenering I'm missing while mining/farming for the second half of the mats. Once I've all the mats needed I'll drop mining and level engenering till 300 and craft everything I need. I'll farm for Robe of the Archmage patern while buying the early taillering mats. Once I got the pattern I'll drop skinning and farm/buy the mats till taillering 300.
---
Between everything I'll farm gold while playing the AH for my epic mount.
---
No, I have no life. No my method ain't for most. No its not fun but an obligation. No the casual life is not for me.
---
Because why not. I play how I want. "But what about the obligation part?, not having fun part?"
---
To grow in life you have to suffer. I don't suffer enough during work and seek challanges in my hobbies. 
---
But secretly I just want to be better than others, thats how I have fun. And no im not a bad person, I'm a nice elitist but always willing to help.
---
Shaman /&gt; Paladins, fight me IRL.
---
You okay with paying $60 then for classic?
---
in what way? alliance warlocks are superior in every PVE scenario imaginable and every PVP scenario that doesnt involve an UD priest or lock.
---
No having both games under one sub is better for them. People are more likely to buy and try newer expansions when they come out if they are already subbed for Classic.
---
No it wont. The server will only hold 3k. The layers wont be 3k capped. They're trying to avoid choke points. So the layers will be like 1k cap
---
Ok, I get it, I was wrong. I'm sorry. It's just that I don't remember having those at the beginning, I got confronted with that topic only in the endgame.
---
Or drift away into [dream land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jWRrafhO7M).
---
I literally dont know more on the issue lol. Asking questions about possible solutions is just that...asking questions
---
Everyone is going to get it seeing as it is the best weapon in the game outside dropping freaking Kel Thuzad.
---
It‚Äôs not about min maxing to do them, it‚Äôs to do them faster and with less down time. Some people want to spend 30 mins max in MC blowing it up. Not 2 hours ‚Äúgetting it done eventually‚Äù with a raid full of Rets or enh shamans lol
---
Walking to Darnassus as alliance fn blows. Whereas Horde just walk through the barrens or take a zeppelin wherever they want to go. 
---
So for me it‚Äôs just the ease of travel.
---
Not if he calls in sick the day before his vacation is about to end! The old switcharuuu
---
No one will know or care who crafted your gear unless they are the only one on the server with the pattern. When I inspect rogues to see if they have devilsaur i never look at who made it.
---
It‚Äôs a nice surprise I can play beta with out a sub, what‚Äôs not so nice is I‚Äôm now gonna sub for beta when it launches...
---
Conversely, is it ‚Äòfraud fraud‚Äô or is it ‚Äòoh shit my business is dying, lie to the customers and hope I can turn this shit around‚Äô fraud?
---
I‚Äôve been around construction long enough to know even people with a heart of gold can get themselves in a really bad situation really quickly..
---
you couldnt heal a 55-60 instance as a feral druid wearing Feral gear.   You need to get +sp or +healing gear, to boost your heals.  
---
My suggestion would be to start to gather good healing gear as you get into BRD/LBRS....and start tackling the end level dungeons and quests.  If you plan to be a healer at level 60, then the gear you are already DPSing in for level 50-55 should be fine to see you through to 60. So start rolling on healing gear in instances, especially if other players dont want/need the items. If you are doing level 55+ instances, they only require 1 healer (except UBRS), so chances are you might pick up some good healing gear anyway.  If you are pugging, just tell the team your plan. If you are wearing feral gear and tanking, say you'd like to roll on healing gear if the healer doesnt want it. Let them need 1st, and if they do, then greed it. If the healer passes....then you need it. 
---
You'll find with attunement runs for Ony, that you have to do these instances many times anyway, so its good to pick up the quests as the rewards can be brilliant, and good gear. Also, if you are having to run UBRS several times, then you'll get good healing gear.
---
Exactly why i made this discussion and video. It seems to be that server transfers and ques are gonnabbe the way to go.
---
Well the developer was the same group responsible for those two really bizarre CDi Zelda games (Wand of Gamylon and some other one), so I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
Check my comment for the spelling error free version, I didn't make the image in the head post, it has many flaws that I've fixed.
---
Very low drop rates says nit everyone will have it by the time AQ is out
---
Lol tier armor sets on gnomes look rly nice
---
Ashenvale: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leqouyOl8Vs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leqouyOl8Vs)
---
you know i must have leveled something like 20 characters to 60 and i've still never really quested in azshara or those two islands in feralas.  i dont think i've ever done darkshore.  I've barely done loch modan.  crazy!
---
This is an amazing map! Thank you!
---
Horde is just better. Cooler. Better looking and fitter.
---
I took a week off, but I don't expect to get that far. Since I'll be home with my bonus daughter (1y old tomorrow!) And my picking up my son from school around 2pm.
---
But I'll be playing a few hours when the baby is asleep and every evening :) chillin a bit lvling professions etc since all my friends and my gf won't play during the day.
---
Im paying regardless of the price, but doesn't it sound like a deterrent 2 years from now? Free games always have higher playerbases so why not a cheaper one as well? Im not even asking to remove the current plan lol
---
You're welcome! I hope you've seen my comment :D
---
Yes you should. So I can kill you!! FOR THE HORDE! (or you can join us we have Zepplines!)
---
Yeah I know I was just using that as an example of why low population players shouldn't be made about refugees from overloaded servers
---
So they had no function?
---
If you're willing to wait 4 years, then yeah, maybe, but that isn't relevant to your question.
---
When your Disarm is parried.
---
Like wtf, that's what I was trying to hit!
---
Not really a healer spec though
---
No surprises here pet classes have historically been a developer nightmare for this game lol
---
I don't think they've given a solid on that one, just "We want to nail Vanilla and then we'll see."
---
I resubbed to support. Now that the date is announced, I want them to see I'm interested. I don't think I'd play beta in any meaningful way if I were to get an invite because I want the purity experience on August 27. Having said that, I would also like help test....so conflicted.
---
Weapon skill is the inverse of defense.
---
So the math is .04% after 5 points. It‚Äôs .04% in 5 areas for .2% per point. From 300-305 it‚Äôs .08% in 5 areas coming to .4% per point. The extra 1% is negated either way cause you aren‚Äôt missing 9% of the time you only ever miss 8% (specials) of the time. The extra 1% is just null.
---
It‚Äôs not like at 300 skill you miss your specials 9%, you just need an extra 1% to negate the way it‚Äôs coded.
---
To clarify the 5 areas its parry, block, dodge, hit and crit.
---
Just go herb/mining if you want gold
---
Woah there watch the earth shock, im on the shammy side of this fight too lol!
---
The price isn‚Äôt an issue except for very very few people. Blizz won‚Äôt even notice if they don‚Äôt play. You‚Äôre getting 2 games for the price of one.
---
I just love how the Horde looks. I'm a fan of Thunderbluff and Undercity, but I'm not a fan of Orgrimmar. Personally I love Stormwind - It's pretty epic. The music is fantastic too. I usually go as Horde and take a visit for funsies. I just hate being a "normie" human/elf/dwarf/gnome though. That probably stems from the tabletop games I play and other RPGs in general, where those are super common. 
---
Tauren are probably my favorite, but their racial abilities aren't my favorite. They're also not a great combo with Hunter, but they're OK at least. I just can't bring myself to care about Alliance racial abilities at all due to the races being so "bleh" for me.
---
Very nice. Also a dagger rogue, I see you are a man of culture.
---
I love healing and don't care for damage so you all are gonna love my Pally!  Hell, I'll even level as Holy and heal all the things.  #healingslut4life
---
will of the forsaken
---
The horde for me are kind of the underdogs trying to make it in this new world and I like that. I like the anesthetic of the Alliance but ho estly everyone in is so bitchy and those paladins and lightforged are practically nazis.
---
$15 for both means the individual values are all less than &lt;$15 so this "new option" cant be equal or greater to $15 if it's only for classic
---
Right and it's not like they actually heal while providing innervate and bres. So useless. I bet you think vanilla raids are hard too?
---
I can see where your coming from. If you still plan on rolling druid though, my EU PvP server (Horde side) guild is looking for Resto Druids (9/18 spots filled) - and we have 1 spot open for a Feral tank (5/6 spots filled). We're pretty big, trying to get multiple raid teams going so everyone can raid.
---
The friends who introduced the game to me played Horde. And back then, you could only have one faction per account (I don‚Äôt know if this is still the case because I quit shortly before Cataclysm).
---
I think I prefer the aesthetics of human Alliance, but being ‚Äúthe bad guys‚Äù as Horde was really cool too.

Ion Hazzikostas still plays the game since he is the game director for wow and he is a scarab lord.
---
It'll be fun no matter what you play. In general, there are plenty of Agil/Hit/Crit equipment for you to acquire.
---
Given streamers make a profit off of the stream, I think one could make the argument that they are using the platform for a commercial purpose.
---
**&lt; TBD &gt; \[Horde PvP\] \[US\] Semi-casual/mediumcore**
---
Hey everyone,
---
So, I'm still figuring out a lot of the details of the guild, but we have the crucial parts in order:
---
* We are a **mediumcore** guild who wants to enjoy ALL aspects of the game -- PvP, World PvP, PvE, dungeoning, levelling, socializing, etc. We will **‚Äúofficially‚Äù raid just once per week** (probably on Tuesdays, 8 or 9 PM Central start time, with raids lasting 3-4 hours, depending on what the guild wants). We will have an additional, completely optional raid (usually for smaller or easier/dated content) on Saturday nights (again 8 or 9 PM start time until‚Ä¶)
---
* Start raiding \~3 months after launch (an average playtime of 2.4 hours per day -- but NO rush!!!)
---
* Loot system is open for debate, but at the moment I have an attendance-based free rolls system planned. Basically, there's +2, +1, and +0 loot. If you are present for ‚â•85% of raids, then you are +2 eligible, ‚â•75% = +1, and anyone else is +0. On optional nights, everything will be free rolls except for +2 items (BiS or close to BiS items), which will be reserved for the most dedicated raiders.
---
Leave a comment or message if you'd be interested. Hope to see you out there with us!
---
\-Oly
---
You will be fine.
---
I guess I should expound a bit. I lose respect for streamers who are emotional, whiny bitches. I don‚Äôt really care if a streamer is the best. 
---
They get viewers because of their ability to engage and entertain, with whatever they bring to the table.
---
Because the restaurant decides what they're offering and what price they want to charge, not you.
---
In this case Blizzard decided that it would be a buffet, not a la carte.
---
If you don't like it, your option is and has always been to take your business to a different restaurant.
---
/emote thinks %t farted.
---
Yes I'm 12.
---
Thats because I didn't you dumb cunt. I used 1 class as an example as opposed to literally going on a rant and listing every single problem with the game. You're a failure. Fuck off.
---
I went where the guild went
---
Not really... selling greys for money is great advice. Theres a lot of people who still don‚Äôt loot and sell everything and then wonder why they are poor.
---
I do not want the F2P crowd in Classic. A pay wall keeps out a lot of the fortnite kids.
---
Uhhh except thats the exact opposite message they promoted. They literally said resub for a chance to get in!
---
Gone through 10 mice over the last couple of years, Steelseries, Razer, Corsair, it all just breaks. I then got a Logitech G502 and I'm never looking back. Hands down the most comfortable and functional mouse out there.
---
Probably SFK. Its the first real low level instance Horde side that I feel like we were actually going in to stop some mad man. RFC was some tiny Burning Blade thing that didn't have an epic feel or epic music. WC is some dank cave elces are squatting  in doing fuck all. But SFK? It had a real epic feel, the moment you walk out into that courtyard to the real start of the instance and the music starts playing is amazing.
---
Yes, the PVE players are a "little off"! They tend to have more mature aged players, who dont get off on griefing other players, they tend to be more helpful with their faction, they tend to value the game more rather than griefing low level players going about their quests, there tends to be less drama on the servers. 
---
So yup, they do tend to be a "little off". 
---
Hope you find what you're looking for on a PvP server! ;D
---
You like their anasthetics? lol
---
But I'll have started on a server by then. I'm hoping to find out where they will be before that first day. But that might not be possible.
---
I often enjoy "mediocre" players that stream a lot.
---
It is the attitude of "I'm the best" that is used unironically by some really bad players (proven by watching them actually play the game instead of just talking about it).
---
OH MY GOD, why do people think that "playing retail for free" is a good bonus?!!!
---
It's forced upon us for purely keeping its image good because it's such a sad excuse of a game. If Classic had a separate sub it would utterly destroy it lmao.
---
Because I'm and edgelord and have to play "Dark" characters. 
---
Also casting animations of Undead are supperiour
---
I play bit of both depending on the mood, Alliance just because i happen to like Night Elves. Literally only reason i ever play on Alliance. But overall i like Horde much more, i prefer Orgrimmar over Stormwind by far and i just like the style that they have.
---
I didnt even notice and just read it as Tauren lol
---
They aren‚Äôt going to ever do it. You really can‚Äôt afford $7.50 more a month? If you can‚Äôt videos game shouldn‚Äôt be your priority.  Vanilla was $15 when it came out in 2004. You should happy it hasn‚Äôt gone up in almost 15 years.
---
I had a Kang the Decapitator on a 49 twink shaman in vanilla. That was fun. The proc was just a bleed but still awesome.
---
Found it! https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/22990080
---
Yup, same thing. However, using a song that you already hate works pretty well if you don't like to get up in the morning.
---
Troll shamans. Decent dps, good healers, great racials.
---
2h fury is only viable horde side isn‚Äôt it ? And bre scores higher than axes In pve dps even calculating the 5% skill orcs get on axes afaik
---
I was on a server that was merged in I think MoP or WoD with 4 other servers and I noticed 2 main issues with it. 
---
First, so many new names. At least on layered servers, you'll have seen some of the people post in chat channels or guilds advertise in trade. With a merged server its 75% of the population you've never heard of. Also causes some issues with naming and repeat names. It's super annoying to have to type /invite CharacterName-ServerName anytime you want to group with someone not from your original server.
---
The next issue is the economy. In a layered server, all layers have a connected AH and 1 single economy. When you merge realms, a lot of items may have different prices and merging them all together can do some wonky things to the economy.
---
its actually-
---
/2 Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Youve been able to play without a sub for years. You just cant play any chsrs over level 20 or something
---
Literally a third of horde plays undead, it was really rough in every battleground
---
Yeah and which part says you need a sub to increase your chances.
---
No worries, most of the community doesn‚Äòt play on a level where threat will be an issue, when threat starts to be an issue you got feral tanks and fury prot warriors, they gonna need ‚Äûslightly‚Äú more heal compared to the same length bossfights on pservers but not over dramatic if you ask me.
---
Congratulations, the people you specifically wanted to avoid are now all on your server.
---
No they arent hard but nobody wants deadweights.
---
Then what is the point of your post?
---
Dooms edge also pretty good for tanking
---
My buddy and I started day 1 vanilla as rogue/rogue. We were competitive, and getting groups together was tough, but ganking was definitely a good time. Would recommend if that fits your goals.
---
Won't stick. Normies want flying, resilience, one hall dungeons, dungeon finder and a dead overworld sorry.
---
I'm sure you're sick of the spelling edits, but in case you're not, here's a few I noticed.
---
Hyial -&gt; Hyjal
---
Hillsbrad Foolhills - Foothills
---
Stranglehorn Vale -&gt; StrangleThorn
---
 My research and all fonts I've scouted for info point out SoC is based on a procs-per-minute rule. So speed doesn't help that much since you'd get a similar amount of procs in the long run. With a fast weapon you're just making them weaker.
---
As double rogue you will have an absolute blast. If you're both dedicated to your trade you will cause much grief. God bless.
---
Noooooooüò¢
---
I always liked priest team mates with hunters.
---
I plan on sleeping at the gym on launch day. Go home to get my computer, then back to the gym. Get something to eat. Back to the gym. Level to 60 at the gym, and then head to a different gym.
---
Every single game with communities far larger than WoW are cheaper than 3 months of playtime. An extra 100k people (example) would exponentially benefit the current potential number of buyers
---
Please look at my comment, the head post isn't my map.
---
I like how they put me to sleep xD
---
You can have both factions now :)
---
Going tailoring/enchanting just like I did on my mage in vanilla
---
I did this with my Brother, we levelled two rogues together and it was brilliant fun. We could do most elite quests together as we leveled, and could also sneak past a lot of trash too.  As you level, most of the upgrades you get are quest items anyway, and you can just run instances again if you want same items. 
---
Was great fun, would think about it again once I've got my main to 60 :D
---
It's basicly 2 games for 1 sub, so we should be grateful instead of complaining. If people don't care for 1 of them then so be it. You're fee is still the same as now and as 15 years ago.
---
Oh man, the first time doing ZF I remember feeling so bad ass
---
Just adding because there appears to be some confusion: classic will run post instant-cast normalization.
---
So multishot (and arcane, for what that's worth) will scale the same for all speeds.
---
That said xBows are still easily BiS for a lot of content.
---
However, getting hitcap in pre-BiS is valuable so you can get value out of the Ancient Bone Bow for surprisingly long.
---
And, of course, you'll be hitting more with the class bow when it gets it's time in the BiS sun.
---
Depends I think the average MC pattern cost 25-50g tip
---
/ignore %t
---
ICC was amazing imo.  The lichking story line was awesome.  Ulduar was probably my favorite though.
---
The pvp scenario part is a bit of an overstatement. UD rogues and UD mages are troublesome as well, hell even bad UD warriors who are stuck in battle stance at the wrong time... And undeads make up for the majority of the horde...
---
Just don't overuse it. When you remember something, you alter that memory slightly based on the current context. If you listen too much, that nostalgic association will weaken.
---

Why is druid healing deadweight?
---
That occurs in every competitive environment.
---
&gt;MORNING
---
hey 
---
i'm interested in joining ur guild, is there a hunter spot open?
---
Dude you can play a human female with back mageweave.... Forever!
---
In which case, you've done a great job!  I thought the original map was a bit cluttered, but you're are elegant and easy to read.  
---
Well done.
---
Yes, I agree. An additional option that is lower than $15 is still a pay wall
---
Thanks!
---
Two gathering professions, then respec the less useful one to Engineering.
---
I found the same map and just did not use it because of all the spelling mistakes.
---
Also, I would love to create a very high resolution map of classic Azeroth and have the skills to do it. The resource though that you linked is very low quality. Is there any other location where I could get the images from? Perhaps from the current beta client? I don't have access to the beta, so someone else would have to provide.
---
DM Kings run
---
&gt;but Blizzard will charge everyone at the price that includes retail
---
Noooo, they won't.
---
You don't need to buy BfA to play classic. You only need an active game account (either active via subscription or game-time-card).
---
A game account can be opened by everyone with a valid email address.
---
Because gnomes look so stupid.
---
OP
---
I main tanked for a top ranked guild competing for world firsts as a clicker.  You will have issues and struggle against fluid players in PvP, but with decent reflexes you will be fine vs pve.  ESO eventually broke my habits as a clicker, but back then it was fine in raids, though not optimal.
---
Anyone here saying you cannot/will not have any success is an idiot.  That all depends on your skills as a player and knowledge in setting up your builds.
---
That's my point....
---
Gnomes are gay so pick human.
---
Inefficent healings. Basically priests palas and shamans are just way better
---
And its actually way more than those 4 stuns if you consider talented stuns, BM hunter has Intimidation, and all hunters can spend the 5 points in MM for improved concussion shot. Shadow priests have blackout, which is a 10% stun chance on EVERY shadow spell they use. Similarly mage has a 10% chance from impact, if they use fire spells. And Deep destro warlocks can spec into Pyroclasm which gives a stun chance to Soul fire. Which means pretty much every class has the posibility of having a stun, while not all of them are equally common.
---
Its been confirmed by the elvui devs that they are working on a version for classic. Im assuming it will be out before launch.
---
This is the only macro anyone will ever need.
---
I Think this is assuming that mobs will have like an 8% reduction to parry from 5 skill. 
---
I doubt that's the case though.
---
Fun story. We ran ST so late into the night that one of our group members fell asleep at his keyboard. We gathered around him and /train emoted until he woke up.
---
Greatly behind getting a priest to mc you into org to snipe warchiefs blessing
---
You can't see buffs on enemies.
---
ah the good old cave on the southern shore of silithus. yes there's a cave,but you have to swim there from feralas.
---
sounds like fun to me
---
Do what you think will be fun
---
Well, not everybody does.
---
its 1.12 - base you'll be fine.. without dedicated grinding....
---
with not much well rested i went 1-30 on my shaman without any grinding other than just killing things that aggro me along the way... I haven't touched any of hillsbrad or 1 thousand needles. I completed about 90% of Stone Talon MTS and Ashenvale... basically I got tons of quests to do... If you travel and do all the Quests zones(dungeons) at-around your level you won't need to "grind mobs"  
---
The only time I had to grind mobs was my first level 60 pre patch 1.12 and also I wasn't aware of the majority of quests.
---
I took vacation from 27th of August - 22nd of September
---
Looking at the data from beta I would say it would drop to 5% needed with 10. Miss rate changes ~.5% based on data with +2 weapon skill which moves with the math of .04% per point in 5 areas, for .2% per point. So over 5 the formula should be the same with .04% per point in 5 areas bringing the total miss rate down to 5% for 310 skill.
---
I am making a big movie cross country and going to not be employed for a little while. I imagine I will be interviewing and looking for work when Classic launches so most days will have nothing to do but hang out with my kid and play Classic =)
---
I'm not ungrateful regarding blizzard. I feel like the game's PLAYERBASE won't survive because obviously a $15 subscription based game will have less players than having two options, one $15 and one lower.
---
How about a swing timer?
---
1.12 talents is fine. But 1.12 talents/itemization/16 debuff slots on 1.0 content is going to make that content a complete joke. 
---
It‚Äôs not blizzlike, so people saying it is are wrong. If it was blizzlike naxx would be available from day one. 
---
The best solution is to tune all pre-AQ raids/5-man dungeons to account for how much stronger our characters will be with these changes. Not talking about changing mechanics, just stats.
---
And the communities in most of those games are complete and utter shite.
---
I'm betting that's a client related thing?
---
It's the same for me. I listen to audiobooks a lot often when wandering in a nearby forest. When a hear a certain paragraph again it takes me back to the very same spot I first heard it in.
---
LONG LIVE GOON SQUAD
---
Ya we could still use some hunters! Hop in the discord
---
You are not paying for 2 games.
---
The subscription price was the same in vanilla...in fact, taking inflation into account, you will now pay LESS per day played than we payed 14 years ago.
---
The only difference is: Now that price comes with 2 games. So essentially, Blizzard is making you the offer to have 2 games for the price of one.
---
So what the hell are you even talking about?
---
By the time I actually didn't know who Tipsout was, I had just seen the "classic streamer starter pack" and Sodapoppin's perspective. 
---
That was what gave me the idea though, so there was sort of a correlation intended, yeah.
---
Taillering / Engenering = bis
---
Herb / Alch = most money
---
Skinning / Mining = most gold during leveling
---
low effort post
---
I start holidays the day of release and go back on Monday 16th. Haven't taken holidays in around 3 years so I don't feel any guilt taking 3 weeks off even during the busy season. Can't wait honestly. Gonna try and just no life it and get as much fun out of it as I can. Also going to try have my siblings play with me on the first weekend as they've never played and I've been trying to get them to play for a day with me to show them why I loved the game.
---
I always pick my race by aesthetics, and orc just happens to also be my favorite in both lore and aesthetics. That being said, I also really love the tauren as a race and aesthetically as well. I'm struggling between the two as an eventual alt. Because I play orc so much and an orc warrior is going to be my main, I think I would gravitate to tauren just because it's likely the only tauren I would make. That's how I would personally base my decision at least. Whatever immerses me the most into my character, really.
---
None. I've scheduled my vacation days for vacations. :) I'll be coming home and after workout/food I think I can get ~5 hours most nights Sunday-Thursday nights. The first week or two I'll put in more hours on the weekends.
---
Thanks for the advice CASUAL
---
I mean... the videos of the speedrun would have Paladin buffs but I‚Äôve yet to see one with them. So none of the current record holders use Paladin buffs, I‚Äôm not sure anyone cares about world last speed run that uses Paladin buffs.
---
So WoW, the biggest MMO for over 10 years with a $15 sub, will die because they'll now get 2 games for 1 sub, instead of 1 game? Yeah makes sense.
---
Bad a GM portal into original Karazhan because the Prince Malchezaar fight bugged, a fleshbeast below was bugged and preventing the fight from starting, so he turned us all into leper gnomes, made sure we were ready and teleported the flesh beast to us, so we could kill it (he wasn‚Äôt allowed), he gave us all snowballs and told us there was an urgent call about an arms warrior chopping down a resto Druid in Alterac valley, then disappeared.
---
I applied to blizzard to become a GM the next day. (Naive 26 year old me was ready to move to their HQ in Paris for the job) never heard back.
---
I applaud any GM that puts in this kind of effort.
---
Sry but isnt that the same for every alliance class and not specifically an alliance Warlock problem.
---
I hear this a lot but I only bonded stronger with *Climbing to the Moon* from having it as alarm tone for a few years. Always brings me back to quiet early morning vibes now.
---
Money made with alchemy isn't all that great unless if you specifically have a flask recipe. Anyone can do it and merching isn't that good as retail. Go with what makes best gold per hour at your gold spot. We don't know what AoE method is best, and each method has different professions that compliment each other. So I'd recommend just starting skinning and finding out your 2ndary later.
---
It's uncommon bit ironically they are the best Threat generation Tanks horde has. If you're pushing later content like Naxx and AQ 40 the extra health from Tauren is nice, but being able to put out more threat means your DPS can let loose a bit more.
---
Anyone that can hide behind a monitor and not be called out publicly will be more inclined to be toxic.
---
Gaming in general provides the perfect platform for that. 
---
Get used to it.
---
You are still limited to only one faction if you play on a PVP server üòÉ
---
So you want to lvl your 40 multiboxed chars all at once I guess ? :p
---
Can't wait for you to ninja Dragon's Call from me.
---
Good point. I'll keep that in mind.
---
Best comment
---
Looks like you're writing from personal experience.
---
Gnomes are better in every aspect of the game, but in PVE it's not by much, 5% int is nothing so people pick the human look, there's a LOT of people that don't like gnomes because of their appearance. I will never understand that.
---
Since the wow community will be divided into two different areas it's better to have two options because nobody wants a dead game.
---
Hell yeah grats to your group for a successful run!
---
Kinda is though
---
What is the lines and circles? Flight Paths for each faction?
---
Swing timer for you and swing timer for enemy is a must imo for all melee classes. cant kite without it.
---
What if I just want to get slightly wasted and oneshot people with lucky windfury procs?
---
Why would you use ts3 when theres discord?
---
People just dislike Gnomes. It's a shame because playing a Human is so boring in a fantasy game. Gnomes and Dwarves are by far the coolest Alliance Races.
---
Your best, most up to date information and discussion will come from your class's discord.
---
For Warriors it's the Fight Club: https://discord.gg/RbCZJtw
---
Because the Alliance is a decadent, decaying empire of isolationists and unrepentant bigots that operates death camps, abandons desperate allies, and regularly places blame for demonic incursions onto convenient scapegoats. The Horde is a band of downtrodden exiles and misfits, several races of whom have escaped literal slavery, and they're fighting for their lives against a world that maligns them for evils beyond their control.
---
I like playing the good guys, and I like siding with underdogs.
---
Also fuck BfA Sylvanas. Unless she's been driven insane by N'zoth or something, as ressurected Vol'jin seems to imply. The Horde have an unfortunate tendency to be mind controlled by eldritch horrors from beyond the stars, so that wouldn't be too out of place.
---
Honestly, this isn't quite true. I leveled to 60 in vanilla without ever grinding beyond the questing. I just did multiple zones for each level range.
---
warlock rely on fear a lot more that other classes
---
You're going to have a divided community which will mean less players for both games compared to just having one game. Less people in both communities makes both games less enjoyable since it's a social game, which can be prevented if you have more people from giving them two options instead of one flat price or GTFO.
---
Yeah, sorry, the usual OP confusion.
---
Personally I like shaman, because of all the potential that totems offer.  Downranked healing wave and chain heal (when you get it) are both very mana efficient, and LHW can be used in emergencies.
---
Perfect for ninjas.
---
https://youtu.be/vX1dPTAQ5_U
---
I did an attempt :)
---
If you want to heal on Horde pick Shaman.
---
Druid's have the most mana efficient heal in the game (Certain rank of healing touch) and Priests are obviously key but if you go Shaman you will heal just fine pre-60.
---
Then when you're at 60 you will have no trouble finding groups or raid spots. 40 man raids can have up to 6 or 7 Shaman healers in them for Windfury and other totems.
---
BRD, Sunken Temple, Mara. Pretty much any of the long dungeons that they chopped up piecemeal in vanilla. Some of my greatest memories in wow were the epic, hours-long slogs through those dungeons. And then you finish, breath a sigh of relief, and ask if anyone wants to do it again.
---
Frustrating in 1v1, you cant really fear/charm and need other tactics against undeads. The worst is UD rogues... If you can freely choose, I'd go for horde. If you cant freely choose (friends playing ally or  something) or are really into high end premades (and dont want to face pallies) you can go ally.
---
Can you play both games at once? I don't think so.  Both games will have less players overall so it's better to give people more options which can bring more people in.
---
I will say, feral has always been the exception for DPS rotations haha! WOTLK druids were absolutely wild. Things like rogue, fury warrior, and mage were all pretty mashy though.
---
My list wasn‚Äôt exclusively blizzard problems, just wrath problems in general. But the victory rush for low level warriors was my intended point. And iirc I don‚Äôt think it healed as much in BC. 
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone really anticipated LFR, especially not as it‚Äôs own difficulty since heroics were the same difficulty as if you just grouped yourself and went. LFR definitely confused lots of us. 
---
But yeah WOTLK gets quite a bit of undue/misguided hate. Tbf it got shit on waaaay harder during its time, same with BC, over the concept of ‚Äúwelfare epics‚Äù. And people who started in wrath were often referred to as ‚Äúwrath babies‚Äù since the game was so noticeably easier. But wrath added lots of fun stuff. Battlegrounds giving xp was probably my favorite haha. 
---
As for the tanks, threat did become a limiting factor at the highest level. I MT‚Äôd ICC 10/25H as a warrior and there some classes that you really had to try to not let pull threat. I haven‚Äôt raised hardly at all since wrath, but man, I LOVED raiding in wrath. Hands down my favorite time.
---
Is there anyway of setting up addons before launch so you are all ready to go right away and don't have to bother setting up everything when it's go time?
---
There's a drop-down above the "Play" button on the launcher. Same place as PTR drop-down.
---
Undead just for aesthetics
---
There really is no bad choice
---
all are really good for pre 60 stuff
---
Priests have a huge bag of healing spells
---
Shammys have chain heal and totems
---
Druids are super versatile and can dps if heals are not needed, though note that they dont have a consistent rez
---
It‚Äôs only as fun as you make it.
---
Took 1 month off for release, planning fast lvl 60 with guild for week 1 mc/rag clear. Level alts to start up the econ after that. Epic mount before times off.
---
Until then, working(military), eating healthy, sleeping regularly, cardio/gym daily. The first week off is going to be next to no sleep, with only caffeine, water, maybe a yogurt/daily.
---
I could easily say that they enjoy it more because nobody wants to play a dead game.
---
Word of advice
---
Every time I mention how the price is ridiculous they come out in droves to try and justify the price.  I wrote this out prior and like to copypaste it to help spread the message =P
---
WoW has sold at least 15 million individual copies plus various expansions that people buy- so even using conservative math at $60 times 15 million = 900 million dollars of revenue. Now I think we can agree that WoW has had much more than 15 million unique players over the years, so its very likely WELL in excess of 1 billion gross revenue from just selling the basic game + various expansions. WoD and BFA both sold over 3 million units for example. I'm sure TBC/WOTLK were approaching or well over 10 million units sold.
---
And if you take a very conservative average of subscription money, lets say 4 million subs on average per year at $15 apiece, that comes out to 720 million PER YEAR in subscription revenue as a rock-bottom estimate.
---
So I'm sorry, but earning over 10 billion dollars from your video game is more than enough. At some point you are simply milking a cash cow and deserve to be called out. I'm not accusing you of this at all, but I really don't comprehend some of the more vitriolic responses I get from this community regarding the cost.
---
Yay I'm not alone for sunken temple! \o/
---
There were times when I was leveling my Paladin that I would begin auto-attacking a mob, alt-tab for a minute or so, tab back in and I‚Äôd still be fighting the mob. It was mind numbing.
---
Yeah you can, also they could both games make a 15 dollar sub and then you can choose. It's just what they require for servers &amp; other expenses.
---
Shoot man that's a waste of time. You can be super fit for less work than that. More work isn't necessarily good or even effective.
---
Well, unfortunately that's how locks play either way. Spamming Shadowbolt is max dps.
---
Got a week ban back then, because i made a new character named SANDLOL and my buddy another one named PVPLOL
---
Corpseran to silithus and just stood there and spammed our names.
---
Yeah we didnt like the sand pvp at all
---
Just seems odd to not have your auto shot somewhere on a random action bar. Plenty of buttons, and since it‚Äôs bound, it doesn‚Äôt need to be in the main skill button section. Being able to see that your auto is started/canceled or whatever is huge.
---
its all about gains bro. levels, ranks, weight, BMI, GAINS BRO
---
The absolute horror that people play a video game the way they want. Can‚Äôt stand nerds like that
---
It is the most fun part of being rogue
---
I know there's people with a similar train of thought but I don't even care if they're milking it for money. I don't want a dead game.
---
I agree, just looking over the list and writing them in the straw poll I only had a few that I had only fun memories of....nearly all the dungeon were so much fun and each we're a great adventure. Now it feels like dungeosn are just a thing to do to get you some gear.
---
As a lifelong Alliance member I have finally conviced my friends to go horde for classic. Was deadset on playing an undead rogue until i remembered that they ride horses. So thats a huge Nope from me! Hell of a drawing though my dude.
---
Not to piss in your cerial, but it actually gets even more complicated and you are 100% right that you need to sim it to get a proper value. Things you have forgotten to account for is rage gained from hitting vs. missing that you further spend on abilities that have a higher chance to hit as well :P
---
I will be there to race for a Pokemon name. I have some choice ones on a bunch of servers already. 
---
I might do something more original though, but the bragging rights of getting a popular name is fun in its own right.
---
No I'm not asking I mean that if you have 1 million players now and split it apart it's going to affect the longevity of both games.
---
A lot of prot talents are great for pvp
---
I thought 16 debuff was always the debuff limit.(correct me if im wrong).
---
Are you saying that mobs during 1.12 vanilla have different stats as 1.12 classic? 
---
I dont understand what you mean by blizzlike. 
---
I feel like any changes that do happen in regards to difficulty should wait till after at least 6 months after release. How i see it, right now the balance is measured against streamers and youtubers and hardcore players, so stuff that is easy for them might be hard for others. Also, having it be easy allows for more varients of builds in the leveling process. Ret, prot pallies, Shadow priests, arcane mage, tank rogue, tank dhammy, and other builds that are normally super difficult in dungeons and leveling are possible for lower skill players.
---
Weren't there certain quests that required you to 5-man UBRS or am I misremembering?
---
No, I'm able to play my legion character; and if you look at the screen shot I posted, we see on my battlenet profile that my account has an active subscription that would expire on th June  26th 2019.
---
It despawned the mob entirely
---
I subbed and next day I got beta invite. To bad servers cant be normal. They are still phased / layered so it makes for lame situations
---
You're thinking of Stockades. RFC had some pretty decent loot. Good caster stuff from the last boss, and a nice sword from Taragaman
---
It just sounds like a ton of fun and chaos, especially if everyone is level 15/16.
---
Hyjal is missed spell Hyial
---
If 50 cents per day isn‚Äôt cheap enough for kids then idk what to tell you.
---
Back in 2009 I knew the only way to quit was to sell my account. Good thing too, no way I would have passed my classes if I hadn't.
---
You build your off set as you level. If a healing item drops and you notice the healer doesn't need roll then feel free to need roll yourself.
---
I lvled both my priest and druid as dps so whenever I ran something I always told the healer if there is something they don't need I would be rolling for it, just so people didn't think I was trying to ninja loot.
---
Because i want my blood DK back !
---
Well, people are free to spend their DKP in the manner that they wish.  If they want a side-grade because it is very marginally better or they prefer the aesthetics or whatever, they are free to do so.  But generally, yes, I would say most would consider such a thing a "waste" of DKP.  
---
To some extent, it's a feature not a bug.  It's better for the raid overall if the person winning the item equips it as a true upgrade rather than a side-grade.
---
Professions for warrior/priest duo leveling and end game? We will talk and heal in dungeons most of the time later on
---
Don't go relapsing
---
So you don‚Äôt want classic wow?
---
You obv don't understand why they created Classic. It's not a matter of playing 1 of them full time. It's a matter of being able to swap around during downtime in one of either games. So it would keep more people subbed for longer, rather than people dropping out everytime they're done with a tier.
---
Well he's talking about fortnite kids. Any kid can afford GTAV or WoW for the next 5 years lol
---
Well you haven't met my mother in law.
---
this is assuming nothing? Bosses will have 14% and you want to reduce it as much as possible, up to 315 you are free from diminished returns on weapon skill
---
orcs and humans are the only class that can reach that high reasonably
---
Maybe not top healer but you will definitely be healing well. Plus you have the added benefit of being the best Decursive bot in the game
---
Seems like a very specific thing to argue about.
---
/S
---
Where is this picture from? :D
---
Hell yeah. I used to do it in late BC with my buddy. It's a lot of fun.
---
I thought each faction had 9 for a total of 17 (Pandaren).
---
Each to their own. I don't have time to raid anymore so I'm perfectly fine enjoying the leveling and getting my dungeon set. Not all people, and probably more than you think, are going to only care about end game.
---
And everyone will keep running BWL until they get it, even after AQ is out. And the drop can't be that bad. I remember most raiding hunters having it eventually.
---
&gt;That doesn't make it "BiS", because it's essentially just a consumable.
---
While I understand most of what you are arguing about, this statement is dumb.  BiS is a term used to indicate it will give you the maximum amount of damage compared to all other items available in the slot.  This item does that, therefore it is BiS.  In a discussion about theory crafting the best output for a class the only thing that matters is how much damage does it help you do.
---
Cannot do all with just one spec. It's either Bear/Heal Bear/Cat or Cat/Heal, the talents for bear/cat are competitive unfortunately.
---
I was Alliance first time and have been Alliance for over a decade.
---
Time to see if the grass really is greener.
---
thats exactly what i wanted to hear!
---
The Emperor's room can be dicey. We almost wiped while fun running our fully Naxx geared group in there by pulling the whole room (didn't have a mage for aoe).
---
You should be thinking about the next 5 or so names you‚Äôd like to reserve now. Create them on day 1.
---
I actually did resub and DID get in, like the day after beta started, that being said i have an account since Vanilla beta (and the Vanilla CE) not sure if that helped
---
Every week.
---
Don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt just be happy Classic is coming back and get hyped for it.
---
Yeah even when/if sub counts dwindle they can always merge servers together.
---
Depends on region and ah prices for your server group.
---
Like for me, I have to pay 120k gold for a wow token, and sell flasks at about 300-500 each(among other things)
---
I like how people bitched about BFA being a gambling simulator but had no problem resubbing for a chance at getting beta.
---
Was gunna say are there really people that don‚Äôt auto loot and sell everything you don‚Äôt need? That‚Äôs how i get a vast majority of my money quickly.
---
How do you define viable?
---
Assuming both players (DW &amp; 2h fury-slam variant) are equally geared and skilled with similar buffs and consumables then the DW warrior should win out MOST of the time
---
However, given that DW fury is basically top of the line dps this still means that the 2h fury warrior is putting up some really great numbers and placing in the top of the meters consistently.
---
Alliance might not have WF but they have sword/Mace skill and Pala blessings (salvation and king are incredibly powerful)
---
And the 2h sword progression is potentially so so good
---
OEB -&gt; BRE -&gt; Ashkandi (UtB is overrated) -&gt; Corrupted Ashbringer
---
All of this was assuming similar skill level but fury warriors and 2h in particular have a very, very high skill ceiling when looking at pve dps
---
I debated on taking that first week off, but I would only get to level from Monday night to sunday. So I did the better IQ play and take off the following week. So monday night- friday I'll be working but still get 6 hours a day, hoping to get to 30 and then have 9 days off to grind to 60 and get some gear before going back to work.
---
but who needs to buy food on retail?
---
Idk. I'm waiting on shadowbringers so I subbed on wow for a month to catch up on 8.1. Between that and classic beta they might be seeing an uptick.
---
Then again I noticed the tokens pretty cheap so maybe not.
---
Spend the summer playing a game that doesn't like you click like TERA or some other action combat game with a lot of buttons - that'll solve that problem really quickly lol!
---
I will go herbalism/tailoring until probably 60. Depending on situation I may drop tailoring for alchemy. It would be cool to get some rare tailoring patterns but alchemy would be more profitable I think. I'll try tailoring for a while, maybe see what I can sell. Gear is valuable again, so no profession is really ever useless, whether for personal use or monetary gain.
---
I have my doubts you are open to having your mind changed but I'll bite. Twinking allows people to quickly gear a character and ready them for pvp with little effort. Some people really enjoy WOW pvp but aren't interested in the grind to 60 and raiding for months to get geared. Twinking allows players to avoid the grind and jump right into pvp.
---
2 weeks off.
---
Last time I was this hyped for anything was Halo 2.

Just saying its kinda pathetic

We would love to have you

We are pretty social as well. I'm 30, my father plays, we have a 39 year old teacher who is playing. That druid with heals would be great but it's your choice üôÇ

Check out the link, we have rules and information breaking some information down. We will be having a meeting in the next month or two going over server, how loot works and other stuff. 
---
If we are a fit, go ahead and register!
---
If people keep avoiding Alliance Warlock, it's going to make it way too easy for pesky Horde Mages to thrive. Go Alliance and give the horde Mages something to cry about! Also Hpal+Mage combo in Vanilla is god-tier, it's worth rolling Warlock on Alliance to be teamed with Paladins because the combo is insane.
---
So I guess 305 weapon skill will be the new meta
---
Huh!? I thought the Alliance were the good guys D: My life is a lie.
---
I‚Äôm confused. All you need is a sub. Wow classic is cheaper than 3 months of played time. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúbuy a game‚Äù. You don‚Äôt have to have bfa. Just pay 15 a month and play classic to your hearts content. I don‚Äôt think its even close to 1000 people who think classic sub is too expensive.
---
Downtime as in server downtime? Aren't they really short in 2019? and I guarantee you that people will NOT swap between games once it comes out other than an extremely small minority. 
---
End result is still two dead games compared to now.
---
Check your battlenet app. It'll be on the In Development tab above the play button.
---
I got in at 12 PM PST yesterday and I still don't have the email, just for reference.
---
specia'l
---
It‚Äôs true from my experience in retail vanilla.
---
Never saw the chromagus xbow drop from dozens of kills. But I did get KT xbow on my first kt kill.
---
This time around I‚Äôm not maining hunter for this reason, I‚Äôll have hunter alt and work on 8/8 dragon stalker over time.
---
If it only reduces chance to be parried by .2% or .5% then it won't be imperative for the tank to be Orc, because he threat and value gained from Thunderfury will easily outpace that small reduction to chance to be parried.
---
Content Downtime. BfA is hitting everyone really hard with content draughts in between patches. So most people (my entire guild 50+ people) will swap in between both games, so I'm assuming a lot of people will.
---
Unfortunately this build really doesn't work. No point in blood frenzy without improved shred and savage fury. Might as well put those points in savage fury and take out the point in nature's grasp for heart of the wild. Nature's Swiftness + Roots is a better nature's grasp hands down, and you likely don't need to NG + NS/HT that often. A better PvP talent would be Insect Swarm, over the 5th point of HotW.
---
Cat DPS without being min/max'd is pretty meh. You really need the damage talents and improved shred, plus you are missing on on OoC for clearcasting and Natural Weapons.
---
The way someone play the game doesn't invalidate the way you play the same game you know. You can do whatever you want and if that's fun for you, youre playing the game right.
---
Each race also starts with different amounts of base stats. Undead warlock has slightly higher intellect than orc warlock. You can see this info on the classic wowhead website
---
BRD is where you'll find me
---
I plan on being in a guild.  and being a Holy Paladin.
---
I plan on wearing plate.  If I am at the bottom of the healing charts, I will change my ways.
---
If there are two of more dress wearing Paladins that I am able to outheal, then I believe my GM will be understanding for me to wear plate.  the two weaker healers are obviously the weak links, not me.
---
If I can sufficiently contribute to healing, without looking lame as fuck, then yeah, I'm gonna do that.
---
Then what‚Äôs the problem?
---
Scarlet Monastery. It was essentially the midway point from just starting off to getting to endgame. All the upgrades you can grab from rare spawns in Graveyard and the BiS Hypnotic Blade from Doan. As well as melee and hunters with Herod, and healers in Cathedral. Also, Sword of Omen. Such a wonderful instance.
---
My idea would be to kill Sylvanas, therefore set all the undeads free (no leader) forming a 3rd faction of forsaken (add new races there - undead orcs, taurens, whatever...). This would be a nice addition to the game. You have red horde, blue alliance and green forsaken ... whats not to like
---
You play magic the gathering and complain about being short, begone card hoarding gnome!

 **&lt;Sacrosanct&gt;** 
---
**Region: NA** 
---
**Realm/Server: PvP Faction: Alliance**
---
 **Raid** **time: TBD**. Whatever is voted as the most accessible for everyone. There will be a few groups of people so raid times will be spread out, and fit most players.
---
**Priority: Raiding, Social Experience, PvP** 
---
**About Us:** A strong, consistent group has always proved to bring the most enjoyable game experience. I want to create a medium sized semi-hardcore community that everyone loves to be in, and are excited to do content with each other. Raiding will be taken seriously and progression will be the primary goal. We are not concerned about being realm first, or any specific time frame. Of course we will mess around with PvP but Raiding is our top priority. Would love to have a solid group going by launch so we can do group content together including dungeons, PvP, and anyone that needs help with something can get help easily! We will accept anyone who has the dedication to support our guild, aid in raid progression, and who have a love for the game.
---
We are still in our infancy but have players join by the day! If you are willing to be devoted from the start and want to aid in recruitment, please join our discord and message me on there for a potential officer position.

Yeah I LOVE BRD, spent so many nights there with my friends doing all the quests with guildies. Loved how many bosses there were and how it felt like an adventure
---
I don't think I'll be listening to the same extent. It's a long way to 60. There will be plenty of time for you to listen to other things as well.
---
At least during Vanilla hunters had cool looking and recognizable sets!

Ctrl+f and search ''To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in.

Is not about increase your chance but you need to be subbed
---
Sunken Temple, one of the greats.
---
I mean of course BRD is hands down the best, ST felt like the first real dungeon.
---
The exact thing that happened to OSRS and RS3 could easily happen to retail and vanilla. Essentially the hyped release went well and after 1-2 years BOTH games were basically dead until they added more subscription options (such as limited free to play and cheaper prices) the community quadrupled instantly.

---
I‚Äôm going to gank the living crap out of them. Non stop harassment everyday. Duskwood graveyard will be orgasmic. Killing them again again again again killing them they are going to quit the game crying
---
You can sell transmute cooldowns. That's how most made their change back in the day.
---
Don‚Äôt play on streamer servers and you don‚Äôt have that problem.
---
You guys will have a ton of fun, the gear will probably come a little slower if you always do dungeons together but I wouldn't worry too much about it.
---
Yeah, this tolerance/convenience detail is the general twist, despite still being a change to the definition itself. 
---
Being it harder or not encounter-wise is tied in most if not all cases to specific ones, usually the gear/damage/heal checks, Vaelastrasz and the likes. This becomes a gear distribution matter, pushing the same bunch out given enough skill. 
---
Hunter comments and the rest (like locks being poor in most low level group stuff) are pointing out the same. Hunters galore in some stuff might be wipe. Lack of them might be the same. The one &lt;insert typical on-the-edge spec&gt; is likely not the issue in raids. 
---
The low skill/damage bunch of mages/furies/rogues/etc might be contributing to it but in most cases it's easier to point out the different guy. 
---
This variety is the one attacked here since PvP is the same. Rets/prots/enh/ferals (no, no HotW please, that's a hybrid not a feral. If feral dress as such, damn it)/oomkins are out of it as well. "Help healers level"... no comments are needed for such point of view (but sadly... that one is too common).
---
Yeah, really TFT more establishes how the horde gets to where it is with Orgrimmar forming, the Forsaken splitting from the Scourge, and I think there‚Äôs a tutorial in TFT that covers the Darkspear trolls joining. 
---
It also explains why the High/Blood Elves are no longer a part of the Alliance, but that‚Äôs kinda it for what affects it has on the Alliance. 
---
Overall is it critical? Yes and no. I only played RoC before doing WoW when I was like 13 and missing all of that never really confused me on anything outside of the Forsaken. You can probably go into WoW mostly blind and be okay.
---
Yes and the Celestia font is there as well.
---
My bank alt, who i will level to 5, will do my disenchanting but solid plan there.
---
Why does it have to stay 40 till release? They need to test the end game dungeons.
---
She‚Äôs making money on grey items bro!
---
They also take up a bag slot if i remember right.
---
It's even less now because of inflation
---
I couldn't decide. Every single one of them, except ST and Gnomer I guess. Most excited for VC, WC, and SFK. Also Uldaman for that sweet sweet Pendulum.
---
Til you Die!
---
This reminds me of my first char, played a troll warrior to level 18 without buying any skills since the starting area (I guess I just forgot about it) when I realized I tried to buy them all and didn't have enough money so I made a new char, an undead mage that ended up being my first 60
---
That's not really the issue with modern wow. It may have turned off a lot of mmo purists but it kept it up to date. Legion was a great expansion after the initial release issues. Wod started out fine but ran out of steam. Mop is finally being looked back on fondly after, again initial release troubles. 
---
Most of wows issues historically has been about content or systems. Not QoL. Either lacking or poor content or unfun and boring systems. Or in bfas case it's got both.
---
Lfg is constantly being pinned as an issue but the only issue is the design of lfg content. Too easy and no need for communication is why people dont communicate. If they were designed with communication in mind then it wouldn't be an issue. It's a community issue not a wow issue.
---
That's his problem. He's the epitome of "get off my lawn u fuckers!!!" and would like to enjoy a dead game.
---
This is my plan also. Back in the day and even in live wow, I prefer to play sans-addons at least while I'm leveling.
---
I just go to work and spend that money on subscription. In WoD all I did is log in on 20 toons to get that EZ money. Got very rich that expansion, but didn't enjoy a single moment. 
---
Wow tokens ruin all the fun and destroy the economy.
---
Just a little taste
---
Cant really do that but im doing some little stuff. I got day off 27, 28 and 29 and just today my co worker asked if i would change my day off with him next week. I said yes but i only want the day off back in september
---
Exactly my thoughts. But i will be finishing my cut when classic comes out. still calculating what to do. but playing entire day without noticing the hunger goes in my favor for sure hahah
---
You're not going to get much love here. Most of the population here atm is driven by the streamers generating hype for the game.
---
Orc has the best racials for hunter, and they actually stand correctly when shooting, unlike half the races. Def orc!
---
Where in the FUCK do I sign up for this guild
---
Right, that's fair, not trusting PServer devs who were only trying to replicate Blizzard servers, and not trusting someone who has given great data, but it only *suspected* to be a Blizzard employee. The part that your argument misses, though, is that the 6% miss chance at +2 level or a difference of 10 between weaponskill is tested and confirmed on Beta as well.
---
For you to be correct, *all* of the people testing hit chance on Beta need to be wrong, as well as the simmers, and the suspected blue poster, and the PServer teams.
---
welp...i plan to take vacay and then afterwards call in sick :D
---
This is false. I‚Äôve been playing since 04 and didn‚Äôt get in. I know a guy that started in legion and did get in. They only took a small selection of the player base, as advertised.
---
Exactly. People forget that mythic+ still works exactly like how they want. Gotta look for a group, ask to join, etc.

---
Hi, 
---
We are not connected to any previous guild of the same name. Some of our core used to play on Tarren Mill in Blackrock Mining Company. That is the biggest overlap in terms of previous guild history. So it is in that sense a new (and improved) roster. 
---
You are very welcome to drop by for a chat. We can always discuss the priest part :)
---
I made a hunter last night just to see what the current version of WoW is like since I haven't played since WotLK. Didn't see a way to manage my pet as there is no pet bar with abilities. Went MM because why use a pet I can't control. Started one-shotting at level mobs with aimed shot. Logged out once I got to Darkshore. Not sure if I'm going to login again.
---
Eh, Vol‚Äôjin uses a bow, I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of bow-wielding hunters that make up troll society.
---
Then enjoy a dead restaurant?
---
I feel attacked
---
I‚Äòm still sad they newer used hyjal in vanilla. It looks so interesting
---
They totally should exist as Tauren only weapons. Would make sense as a thunder bluff rep reward.
---
I'm definitely reserving that guild name as soon as I can heh

Phase filters and info in quick facts is something we hope to add on Classic Wowhead, if we can get more confirmation from Blizzard on things like Molten Core loot. This would be slightly different from showing added in patch, as some things fall outside patch &gt; phase patterns. It was discussed in the site's weekly Classic update yesterday: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292062/weekly-classic-wowhead-database-update
---
I would recommend making the "References" labels visible somewhere on the main page. Currently, you have to click up in the Help --&gt; References tab to look up what your labels mean.
---
Hey Hoof, DM me your discord I was in Ordinal but lost your contact it's Psy :)
---
All classes get more procs with faster weapons. Slower weapons were still better.
---
Til the light dies in your eyes
---
&gt; They probably thought about adding Arthus into the game, but didn't map out Northrend or think of Ulduar yet etc.
---
They 100% were planning for Arthas to be in the game.
---
The community is going to be divided regardless of the sub fee. How many people do you honestly think aren't going to ever play classic unless the sub is, say, $7.50 rather than $15 a month? I'm sure there's some, but the real cheapskates are always going to play free privates, and the vast majority of people that want Classic will *gladly* pay the $15. There's people on this sub who clearly absolutely hate Blizzard and will still be paying them $15 every month for the next few years. Many people, myself included, would pay double that if we had to.
---
If it would make them more money, they'd be doing it already. They know they don't need to bother whatsoever.
---
I wish you were my professor.
---
I think they just want badges. Why else go gyms?
---
What an embarrassing post OP xDxD
---
Im going to get skinning and mining. Skinning for vendoring leathers just for a little extra income, gonna be scavenging for bag space and AH won't be worth it. For mining my plan is to level it while avoiding smelting as much as possible and mailing the ore to a 2nd character for engineering later. 
---
I just have a feeling I'll end up selling the ore/bars so I can afford skills and level 40 mount but thats the plan.
---
Gnomes have a minor edge from a stat and perk perspective. People tend to prefer humans for the athstetics. As an Undead Warlock during vanilla, I envied escape artist. Humans looked cooler though.
---
I agree SM was in a great place where you are at a high enough level where you have a good amount of spells and have recently lost the training wheels.
---
A. Less system resources.
---
B. Not as intrusive.
---
C. Gaming Hipster.
---
Image = good  
---
Game = dead  
---
Who wins now?
---
Both sides are inherently flawed.
---
1on1 they aren't tough, their true strength lies in their numbers and density. They pray on those who can't los pull
---
To your point 2: I remember having to manually target the next mob with everything but a gorilla as a pet.
---
I also remember having a Hunter's Mark + pet attack macro that I used religiously.
---
Yeah will adding be functional upon launch? Like are the devs of the addons you listed reprogramming the addons to work with classic?
---
Yes, but they're inaccurate which is why I didn't include them in my edit. The head post isn't my work, the edits linked here are.
---
Very few. You can always check the id files with CTRL+F if there's something particular you want to check.

[Horde quests](https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing/blob/master/src/routes/horde/quests.json)
---
[Alliance quests](https://github.com/wickstjo/vanilla-questing/blob/master/src/routes/alliance/quests.json)
---
I'd go for double hunter as they have big burst DPS, and dont scale with their gear anyway.. If you pick Night Elf you can still go invisible with Shadowmeld.
---
Additionally, you will have to travel to most of these zones for the Flight Paths anyways... So just think of it as  collecting the FPs early.
---
&gt; If retail is so easy, were's your mythic 10/10 ?
---
Are you kidding?  What idiot would pay to play retail wow?
---
Haha makes sense
---
As much as 21 disc 30 shadow for priest
---
Callind dps DD's is common on german servers and hobestly it makes so much more sense. Saying that im a dps technically makes no sense whatsoever.
---
I thought I made it pretty clear that it was not feasible to do it, honestly. I mostly did that mockup to showcase why it wasn't feasible: you can put endless amounts of work into the model and still not be anywhere near an accurate estimate.
---
My problem is sometimes I don't want my pet to attack just yet.
---
It would be cool. Not versed enough in lore to come up with any ideas, but seeing as they risked a lot in later expansions with new ideas, it can be done. They actually had ideas for the dark portal prior to BC that involved *every* server completing requirements before it opened. Then you would have access to rare hunting grounds on the other side, and stuff. That was the idea just before vanilla released, anyway. We obviously know what that idea spawned.
---
week off is just another number for us neets, remember wagie, you will never get ahead
---
now it's thousand of dollars :)
---
No. D2s items were fairly random. There weren't affixes iirc.
---
The Questie Addon does a good job of this feature. You may find some useful code in their addon.
---
can't really quit the game once you become Scarab Lord
---
The 6day ppl averages 45-60min a day but I usually spend 90 minutes.
---
I do expect to see rage quits early on during classic (simply due to the fact making groups has been extremely fast and easy for over a decade now), but once it sets in for people that sometimes waiting 10 minutes for someone while they're afk is better than just leaving and spending an other hour finding a group. Specially DPS.
---
I want to spend several days clearing Blackrock Depths.
---
If you're running with a dps priest or dps shammy(someone who can ress) I'd consider going for druid, otherwise druid isn't really a viable option tbh.
---
I never did SFK or RFK in retail vanilla (or was level 60 already). I remember doing BFD once on my very first char, but I remember virtually nothing about it. I voted for BRD because it's the best ever.
---
Druids use weapon skill but if iirc can‚Äôt increase theirs. When you switch to bear or cat you use feral weapon skill which is capped at your lvl*5.
---
God damnit it‚Äôs a SHEATH?!?!?
---
I'm pretty sure wow classic will not be a dead restaurant despite their not acquiescing to your pricing structure demands.
---
Not really, asked a question and got it answered
---
/e Has reported you AFK, to remove this debuff and to not be kicked from the battleground please type /AFK.
---
Rag sucks ass without DBM for melee.
---
In 1v1 pvp, you dont even need the macestun. There are enough gadgets and weird items and the rogues' innate cooldowns that you basically can't lose if you get the jump on someone and know what you're doing
---
Private servers are shutting down in August though but I get your point. 99% of the current community is definitely ok with paying the current price but they're just blocking newer players from trying it out by bombarding them with two different games at once
---
So now we have  
---
New players continue ignoring WoW as they have in the past 15 years because options havent changed
---
A community split into TWO
---
That may be the most autistic thing ive ever read. Can you even read haha
---
hardiness is better.  it helps against classes the warlock is most vulnerable to (rogues and warriors) and you can still break fears with the trinket (or felhunter eating a warlock fear)
---
On the one hand you would be the audience for classic so clearly they want you to play. On the other hand, we all hate you now.
---
*Laughs in Blackrock Depths*
---
I'll be doing mining+skinning while I level. Skinning for gold to get a mount at lvl 40. Once I've made enough gold at level 60 I'll drop skinning for engineering.
---
If you have the time, you could even drop mining on your shaman for something (maybe enchanting) and level an alt for gathering.
---
I can understand your point. It's just really stupid
---
Windfury totem.
---
if you're struggling with mages, then its a player issue and not a racial issue. rogues are only hard if you're not playing SL which you should be, since this is clearly an argument of 1v1 scenarios
---
If you CAN play a gnome, you should.
---
You're one of those "I'll pay you in exposure" type people aren't you?
---
Not seeing threat meter on your list QQ.
---
Having to min/max MC to clear it is delusional. It's stupid easy
---
Do, wait.  Should hunters not run improved aspect of the hawk because it will result in clipping autos?  And what about using 3.1-3.3 speed crossbows.  Do you want to use them without a quiver?
---
PM'ed
---
PM'd
---
This isn't the game for you if you want to blow through everything
---
Hasnt been my experience
---
Often that's how long it takes
---
i mentioned that in my reply. there isnt a matchup that warlock cant win without fear except priest and lock 1v1s where you will struggle and this is the only situation where WOTF hardcounters you.
---
Ashenvale has always been a favorite of mine. I've been a huge Night Elf fan since WC3 and although they lost most of their personality when coming to WoW I still enjoy playing as them.
---
Your font is fucking satisfying
---
Because you don't actually need 9% from gear in classic as you get that 1% as a bonus for having 5 extra weapon skill, on top of the gains from weapon skill.
---
My friends wants to play horde :)
---
I really think it‚Äôs funny how universally acclaimed BRD is nowadays because all I remember from Vanilla is how reviled slogging through it was.
---
I think Stormwind and Org are pretty even when you compare the pros if both.  Consider the following:
---
**Stormwind:**  Better layout, better music, easier to defend faction leader, better zone location, cooler portal destination room
---
**Orgrimmar:**  Lots of spikes
---
Wow, people still buy physical play time cards? Who even does that and why?
---
battlegrounds are a team game though
---
this is pretty important for pvp city raids as well
---
That's what I'm sitting here thinking as I read all of these threads. People cleared these raids when no one knew any of this stuff
---
I have no memory of that.
---
But then, I didn't know shit about the game back then either.
---
There's a hotkey for it too, Q. Escape also closes all prompts. I'm trying to figure out how to communicate this to people better.
---
huge pain in the arse
---
I think alot of people are missing the point of +wep skill, the reason why it is so good is because of glancing blows.
---
Each auto attack you make has a chance to be a glancing blow, maybe like a 40% chance against a lvl 63 each wep+ skill reduces this chance by a certain % until you get to like 309 and then you get diminishing returns. 
---
The numbers i give might not be correct but they give you a general idea of why it increases your dps so significantly as rogues and warriors damage is mostly white auto attack hits.
---
&gt; if only they were able to kill him. then we wouldn't of ever had the cataclysm and the golden era of wow could have continued. i blame the ginger mage.
---
Yeah, cause no one ever comes back from the dead...
---
The population doesn't mecessarily have to die down. After a few months people will have all different kinds of levels and be naturally spread out.
---
2.9 is the slowest Bow.  It's not slow enough to avoid clipping autos though.
---
It was never one faction per account; just one per pvp server.
---
I will be spending hundreds, maybe thousands of hours looking at my character. Horde is just ugly and gear looks ridiculous on them.  Rather look at something pleasing. Alliance!
---
I believe it to be true, but it's a completely different experience to rogues or warlocks.  Elemental shaman does work, maybe less reliable than a stronger or better counterpart, hence calling it subpar. But boy when it does, that worth every minute.
---
Also you can't examine it in vacuum. You pair it with any class (for BGs mostly) , preferably with cc and it does produce some unexpected bursts.
---
For the gear problem: unless you get your hands on the pvp epics most AQ40/Naxx geared people will fucks you up whatever class you play at least try to enjoy the experience.
---
I leveled my lock from like 32-40 in SM. Loved that place.
---
You're splitting the current community into two. Guess who did this 6 years ago? Right, Jagex. So after the successful release of Old School Runescape the game hit peak lows after around a year from release because of the lack of pricing options (you had to buy a sub for both games LUL). Around a year of mediocrity passes and they finally add F2P and lower price options to subscribe. Population shortly quadruples into it's current-day peak.
---
WoW classic will be a dead restaurant if there's no make-up for splitting the community into two.
---
You probably don't live in North Korea, so you don't have to watch. I don't watch WoW streamers and I feel just fine. Exercise a little freedom.
---
It literally wasnt? Else they wouldn't have fixed /camp in the beta.
---
Mara is my favourite vanilla dungeon, I had the staff to open the portal on my first char to 60 and I was very popular on my server because of it haha
---
If you don't farm at all you will find it hard to compete, this isnt the bare min but it also isnt the req for the best of the best. What you are decsribing sounds like mid-high end raiding though.
---
I don‚Äôt plan on using raid add ons. The game isn‚Äôt going anywhere and I‚Äôm sure as shit not going to in the first 40 man group to down MC. So why do it? If you want to, go ahead, but I won‚Äôt be doing it.
---
What is the Alliance equivalent of this?
---
No they have no reason to
---
amazing graphics.
---
I've got to use the most jarring music or sounds for my morning alarm. Don't know how people wake up to calming music.
---
That's a 10 man....i tried to keep it limited to 5 mans
---
Transmutes are like 5-10g daily. That's not much for someone who's looking to make gold.
---
Can you link this?  Does this ever balance out at 60?
---
RIP Errinys
---
The trolls were a part of the Orgrimmar section if I'm not mistaken.  There are no real Orc sections in TFT besides the Orgrimmar ones.
---
Sure. But you wont be able to clear it within the first or second ID without maximum efficiency.   
---
Are there bad min/maxers? Sure. But saying min/maxers need to compensate is just ridiculous. And I am not a min/maxer at all.
---
I can still remember that "too much threat" sound
---
Nah, more like "give me a discount to not play your shitty 20 year old game LUL"
---
That is......awesome.  If you guys pull off a week 1 rag kill then you're all legends.  Please do this and document it.
---
Just keep in mind you can't track both herbs and minerals at the same time, so if you're going duo gathering it's best to make Skinning one of them.
---
Priests don't have enough mana to AoE down most high level mobs. The whip lashers in DM E that every priest farms for gold have about as much hp as a typical level 35 mob and priests barely have enough mana to kill them, so priests could AoE farm mobs around that level or lower.
---
I think Alliance is just a bit too bland for me. Typical fantasy tropes, nothing all that interesting.
---
Horde culture just feels a lot deeper. There's a lot of interesting history and architecture among the Orcs, Tauren, and Trolls.
---
I also feel like The Horde are more of the "good guys" in the conflict. They're really just some people trying to make it in the world and resist imperialism. The Horde values qualities like duty and honor. We'd never make a guy build our city and then not pay him... and then instead pay some random adventurers to brutally murder him and return with his head.
---
the bare minimum to raiding in classic is having a computer to play on
---
No. Classic raiding is not all hardcore at all. MC, Ony, ZG are all quite easy. BWL has a couple of difficult fights. AQ40 isn't mechanically difficult, it just requires all the raid members to get nature resist, which is tough to do for 40 people. You don't need to be elixired/flasked through your nose to down bosses, grab one or two of the big ones for your class, make sure you're enchanted properly, bring some health/mana pots. If you're gonna tank maybe you need a bit more, but for dps, at least for the first few raids, the most valuable thing you can be is physically present.
---
Yea at level 60 a rogue is going to make quick work of a mage. Watch some old rogue pvp videos and you‚Äôll understand why everyone dreaded that stealth noise.
---
Angry.
---
Alright just accept any thing thrown at you in life.
---
I remember how confusing it was...I only ran it a few times before burning crusades came out and I always had my friend with me.... Otherwise I would miss bosses or just flat out get lost
---
Someone pointed out the "scratching" and between that and the massive neck hump, I think I gotta go Orc
---
I don‚Äôt think it was an actual campaign thing, if I remember right. I remember it being about Thrall and company having a bit of shipwreck on the way to Kalimdor and that‚Äôs where he meets Vol‚Äôjin and the Darkspear. There was dialogue but it wasn‚Äôt voiced. I‚Äôll have to look for it when I get home because now I‚Äôm curious where it‚Äôs at lol
---
Everyone roll on RP and leave the other servers for twitch chat.
---
It's less about more servers and more about more layers.
---
Tell me you are not one of those kids who found those troll actions funny
---
I feel like the planned phases is the only reason this could work actually
---
Me and GF has taken tues-sun off work. Gonna cook lots of food on before hand so we can just heat it up. Not planning to go the gym but planning 1hour a day of out trailing in the woods. And a small 5min break every hour to move around.
---
Aszhara, its so beautiful with the lore and everything. But its way to empty on Quests and Mobs.
---
Take it all , just keep fighting til you Fall!

Great thanks! Maybe brief instructions listing hotkeys when you create your character profile, or a hotkeys tab at the top?

I believe release day is a Tuesday, so I'll be working. After work I'll log on and start playing until bed time. Then I probably won't be able to play again until Friday, when I'll play after work again for a few hours before bedtime. I'll try to squeeze in a few play sessions that weekend, time permitting. My goal is to be level 15 by Sunday at 10pm.

That will depend on variables we can't account for. Server population, average guild size, etc. You gotta get out there and find out. Set aside some time. I remember splitting MC and ZG into two runs of 4-5 hours each, so maybe find a weekend raiding guild, or at least a pug group that likes to run those days.

we're getting 1.12 so not until naxx

That really, really sucks.
---
Paladins Seal of command will not proc more with a higher swing time. It procs at I think 7 ppm not matter what. PPM is wow for procs per minute. So using a slower weapon means you will have more procs on the swings you take per minute because you always get 7. Less swings means a higher proc average. The ideal paladin weapon would only swing 7 times in a minute.

Here's what I did and it worked well
---
First, yes, get a 12 button gaming mouse. People will recommend Razer Nagas but I had two and they died too fast. I now have a Red Dragon Perdition and it was a quarter of the price on Amazon than a Naga.
---
Second, get a bar mod like bartender and set the primary bar up to be a 3x4 rectangle. They should be keybound as 1 2 3 on the top two, 4 5 6 on the second row, etc. to exactly match the orientation of the buttons on the size of the mouse. Take that 3x4 rectangle and move it so that it's right under your character's feet.
---
This makes it so it will be very easy for you to associate a button with an ability because you are starting at what is essentially a picture of your mouse in the screen.
---
Start by learning a couple of abilities at a time and develop muscle memory as you go. I'm on my phone but hit me up and I can send a screen shot later when I get home.
---
Nice analogy.

Did they actually say that though?
---
Either play it or don't then. No one is holding a gun to your head to "play a shitty 20 yr old" game. If it's so shitty then people wouldn't be clamouring to pay n play, especially after 20 years

Human female rogue change my mind

Hillsbrad Foolhills should be "Foothills", Strangelhorn Vale should be "Stranglethorn", Aralhi Highlands should be "Arathi" and probably many more.
---
Its a PvP server though, I don't think there are any zones that are neutral to both factions.
---
Weren't scholo and strath 10-mans?
---
Don't get me wrong, when it did get that double or triple WF proc, O. M. G.  WORTH!  But it was not very reliable.  Also purging buffs off people when they thought they were safe was also &lt;3.  I will say that I did re-roll to mage and that was the most satiisfying experience.  I could Elemental Mage or 3 Min Mage when ZG came out.  The lols at popping hero charm + PoM Pyro and Arcane Mind.  See some dude half way across WSG, and you pop that shit.   BLAP!  LOLOLOLOL.  It still makes me giggle.  LOVE IT.

Hey man, if you're still looking for a guild please feel free to contact me on discord Howaito#3139 or join our server https://discord.gg/ZSsSz7E
---
Who cares about Stormwind in classic.  It's all about Iron Forge.
---
Couple things I suppose.
---
15 years ago, the game was new for everyone.  Sure, there were always a few guilds that were father along the curve, but for the average player and average raiding guild - everyone was new and everything needed to be learned.  So wiping over and over, having been on countless guilds that disbanded because they couldn't get past a certain point in the raids, and having to start over several times on your raiding journey gave this impression that raiding was super hard back then.
---
But if you really look back on it now - we all know how to play now.  And really, it was never even the content, but rather the logistics.  The length of each raid and number of nights people had to commit - it was hard for anyone.  And back then, it was such a hodge podge mix of players.  You had hardcore gamers mixed in raiding guilds with casual gamers and pvpers.  So because everyone mindset on what they wanted out of raiding and the endgame was different, it was hard to keep people together and keep on progressing.
---
Going back to classic or private servers: people know exactly what to expect and what to do.  Casual players won't going back to classic to raid.  They will going back for the experience and probably some endgame pvp.  Whereas the people with the time will be looking for those raiding guilds.
---
So yeah, because its most likely that you will be in a guild with like minded people: progressing will be easier.  Plus, its 15 year old content.  Most people going back can do those raids without much extra thought.
---
If you want to farm reputation, human is great. 
---
If you want to hide in a bush and put DOTs on everything, gnome is great.
---
You will swim in the occasional puddle as a gnome, and escape artist is technically good, but anyone you'd use it on has another gap closer unless you pair it with rocket boots (engineering). Warlocks are just slow, you're better off facetanking.

Why is it whenever someone mentions going to the gym at all, people who don't go to the gym take it as "bragging"?
---
This is an anonymous internet forum, there ain't no bragging here, just preparation talk
---
I think Sylvanas has just straight up lost it, no Old Gods required.
---
Druids use claws which are always at the maximum for your level. A level 59 Druid has 295/295 skill in forms, and when he hits level 60 his claw skill is immediately set to 300/300.
---
There is no way for Druids to gain weapon skill, but if the fishing pole mechanic is not a bug then Druids should effectively be able to get 400/300 skill for their attacks.
---
No clue if that's intentional though. Guess we'll know in the near future once Blizzard work out all of the various bugs.
---
Excellent post, but let me add one slight nitpick.
---
&gt; According to the test results, it seems that for a mob 3 levels above you (raid bosses) you have a base 8% chance to miss the target.
---
That's not what the testing shows, technically speaking. Specifically the testing has shown that for a target 3 levels above, and with no weapon skill bonus, the miss chance is
---
&gt; Miss: 8.36% ¬±0.82% (382)
---
with a 95% confidence interval. The reason why we know you'll have 8% miss against a boss level mob with 300 weapon skill, and the reason why we know why the first point of hit from gear/talents will be "ignored", is that a blue posted it. It would have taken **a lot** more testing to figure out that weird little interaction between hit from gear/talents and weapon skill.
---
The majority of your damage is auto-shot damage and AotH increases that significantly, as does a quiver.  It does change whether you clip your auto-shot or wait for auto-shot then aimed shot though.
---
Won't they have to open up the beta to level 60 to test end game content and class mechanics? Or is the first month of launch going to be like a beta?
---
Female dwarf rogue or female tauren shaman. Almost all alliance rogues go human and shaman is one of the least popular classes and most go either orc or troll.
---
Not fast enough to be worthwhile these days IMO.  It was different back in WoD when your Garrisons would do most of the work and just playing a bit each day would cover the cost of the sub.  Obviously still works for some folks - especially the top tier neckbearders who can sell runs - you know, the folks with the AH mount.
---
Yeah got 2 accounts no beta. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 14 years. Pretty sure I know what game is for me. Also, people play games and doing things certain ways makes them happy. Some people like to compete for world firsts and things of that nature. It‚Äôs always been that game. Just because you don‚Äôt enjoy blowing through content, doesn‚Äôt mean others don‚Äôt either.
---
So... you're telling me that you have 2 accounts that were invited to the Beta?
---
&gt; Private servers are shutting down in August
---
Uhh, some of them. Privates will always continue to run, there isn't gonna be some mass shutdown just because Blizz launched Classic.
---
They're not blocking anything, all you're asking for is a cheaper sub. It'd still have an entry fee. It sounds like what you're really looking for is a Classic trial, which I imagine they'll implement when the hype dies down. Probably a level 1-10 demo. Retail has been free up to level 20 for *years*, if anyone wants to play WoW, they will play WoW. If they can't afford $15 per month, it's likely they can't afford $10/7/whatever.
---
&gt; A community split into TWO leading to no net gains and only a loss on both games 
---
This makes no sense. What loss?
---
**Here's the key**: The few players attracted by lowering the sub fee for Classic will absolutely not be worth it when every other Classic-only player who was previously giving $15 a month is now giving $10 or less. It's absurd. Wanna know how I know this? They aren't offering a Classic-only sub.
---
That's not really griefing then.
---
So...Blizz gave you 2 beta?  That seems like a poor allocation of resources to test bugs unless Blizz is specifically concerned with multiboxing.
---
I was tripping on shrooms once and had the WoW soundtrack playing, I think it was the Darnassus theme that started playing and it filled me with such incredible dread for some reason. I was sitting in my couch at it felt like I was dmall boat slowly drifting past some fortress filled with witches and just pure evil. Ever since that I've had a sweet spot for that track.
---
Female dwarf rogue, undead warrior, gnome warrior, female Tauren hunter are all likely to be pretty rare.
---
Well you can be right in some cases, this is why we have ‚Äúveteran‚Äù members sit in on loot council weekly and it gets discussed. We often had a spreed sheet with attendance, consumables, loot given etc. the issue with just a DKP style is when you need an off tank a fury warrior isn‚Äôt going to use dkp when they want to have more to get dft. It punishes people for loot that helps the raid.

Questie is good at showing you where objectives and quests are in proximity to your current position which isn't possible for me. However, it doesn't offer a systematic order to pick up and complete those quests in which is what ends up saving you the most amount of time.

I have a paragraph in the manifesto to specifically point of how useful Questie is. You should use both!

---
Blizzard should be thanking us when the game launches and there is ginormous commercial success.
---
Instead I know this sub will be flooded with "Blizzard, Thank you" inspirational virtue messages.
---
What show?
---
Fuck that guy. Seriously.
---
Yeah gonna make money 9ut of enchanting eventually
---
Also cliques get destroyed immediately, they often are the ones who cause drama and is the reason I am hesitant to ever take a group of people more than 2-3
---
Most rogues arent swapping to sf
---
Yes they are two completely separate 2004 beta/launch accounts.
---
That's only on beta And most  seem to want to be pve on live. If only cause they're going to constantly be ganked otherwise.
---
It was like a little addon and showed more RPG elements in the game.  You could go around as Thrall and, I think, Rexxar and do quests and level up.  It was probably their first polished precursor to what would eventually become WoW.

$15 a month is a very VERY small price. The people who can't afford that aren't really Blizzard's target market, because if you can't swing $15 a month, then you're clearly doing everything you can to keep a roof over your head and not too worried about playing Blizzard's video games
---
No worries dude - i herby offer my aid with that burden.
---
Just pm me the info for the second one. 
---
Im a trustworthy german and happy to help :)
---
The fishing rod thing is interesting because it suggests that druids are currently using weapon skill based off of the weapon they're equipping. If a warrior equips the fishing rod they'll have the same thing happen, only fishing rods don't count as weapons for the purpose of warrior abilities, so it's not useful to them.
---
UBRS/LBRS. I always liked the whole blackrock.
---
It's not like they choose accounts by hand (except streamers).
---
There are some good spots that pairing skinning + vendor greys can get you your level 40 mount fairly quickly.
---
Because I didn‚Äôt want to commit yet just want it handy. I‚Äôm weird I know

I was there!!

---
Female dwarf priest.  Fear ward is so good, female dwarfs are so bad.
---
Maybe shamans and priests,  but I remember a lot of troll hunters, mages, and rogues in vanilla, and they are the best minmaxed pve tank for threat generation. I believe Tauren will be less popular among the classes they have in common, and trolls will be behind undead in their common classes except for warrior.
---
I have 10 days off, and I decided to start on the Friday of the first week of release.
---
MC/Ony/ZG are very casual friendly
---
no thorium point at the release?
---
That's seriously depressing dude.
---
Oh I forgot about that u right then the damage only really helps PvP in end game?
---
Some of us actually enjoy both. Beta right now is a nice change of pace from raiding and pushing key in BFA. Also, calm your tits... It was a joke.
---
You can't really take a look at the pserver speedruns. They are abusing the world buffs which wont be possible in Classic.
---
So it is confirmed #showtooltip will work? Awesome!
---
That's entirely fair, let me instead say that the test results we've had are at least compatible with the model from wowwikki, which suggests the results I've posted.
---
Only if you intentionally group with someone on another layer to escape/follow someone.
---
But the layering is temporary anyway. They intend to get rid of it as soon as the population drops to a level where it's not needed. Which the estimate to be something like 2-4 months after launch.
---
I absolutely loved ToC. Yes, the area was not exciting, but I always thought it was neat as an idea, training for the big fight. 
---
I also loved most bosses and their mechanics (on heroic). Anub and Twins were phenomenal imo. Jaraxxus was also lot of fun, especially for mages.
---
And the visuals were bad? T9s are my absolute favorites to this day, especially alliance plates (I loved faction specific gear!) - my main pally is still mogged T9 with Bastion of Purity and Mace of Unrequited Love, and he looks awesome.
---
It's shame that most people didn't have such a blast in ToC that I did..
---
Blizzard isn't the same company it used to be, they fuck over their employees whenever its convenient for them like any major corporation.
---
I wouldn't want to work for them either.
---
I want more information about the state of wc3 reforged. I‚Äòm almost more hyped for this than I‚Äòm for classic
---
This is SO good!! 
---
Once I figure out what faction to play I'm gonna pay someone to draw my classic rogue.
---
Where is the original picture hahaha?
---
Perhaps, perhaps. We'll see. With Vol'jin's miraculous return and explanation that a mysterious entity he incorrectly assumed to be one of the Darkspear Loa told him to pass the mantle to Sylvanas, I suspect that there's more afoot than singular psychosis (or that the entity in question simply wanted to see chaos unfold and had future sight, but I really hope it's none of that Infinite Dragonflight bullshit again).
---
That one was added in TBC.
---
So I'm gonna grind to Daft Punk's Voyager on repeat. That song makes me happy.
---
Hand of Edward the Odd is actually a very decent ele/resto weapon in early content stages because of how powerful the proc is.
---
Not trying to depress anyone, just opening discussion about multiboxing :(

Many streamers are current wow players even. They're planning on raiding in 8.3 as welll

#nobetaforme
---
Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
---
Troll and dwarf rogues, tauren hunters.
---
Uldaman is one of only 4 dungeons I bother with while leveling.
---
Yeah, I definitely don't want to take away from the effort being put in by the beta testers!
---
Looks like you have isboxer. Why not go to a 3 man setup. I Been running Druid warlock mage.
---
No name changes, guild/item/character data issues, and it's essentially fully automated.
---
They literally just turn off the server's ability to layer itself one day.
---
Yeah I mean he even prefaced it with "at the very extreme..." and this is definitely the extreme.
---
No reason to downvote, he's technically correct, and you can bet at least a handful of the top guilds will be doing this unless something changes (and you know how people feel about changes).
---
&gt; This is not for hunters. Shoo. 
---
:&lt;
---
Subscriptions stack up, so $7 for just classic will give you double the months compared to not playing retail and only classic for $15. This easily brings in way more players considering the current hype random people are seeing.  
---
The loss is that you used to have x players in only one game (today) and now both games (in august) will have that number divided into two. Same thing happened to Runescape where it was dead after splitting until they added more payment options for subscriptions.

So it's been ~50-54 from acute ratdiation syndrome / fire / explosion and 9 children deaths from thyroid cancer. WHO **expects to see** up to 4,000 deaths among the 600,000 emergency workers, evacuees, and residents of the most contaminated areas. However these 4,000 deaths have yet to be observed and it will be very difficult to discern the chernobyl caused cancer deaths from regular cancer deaths.

Wasn't he the one that literally couldn't die unless you had some quest item?
---
I hate the idea of dual boxing. The game is meant to be played with other people. To NEED other people. 
---
This is literally the opposite of what I would consider the spirit of the game. To engage and invite other players to your group in order to accomplish your shared goals. Multiboxing exists in direct contradiction to that.
---
Im always curious how you gear up those characters at the end game. Do you multibox them through dungeons/pvp/raids as well?
---
Yes isboxer. I don't have a third account with beta access yet :) At launch I plan to go three.
---
How much are tokens going for right now?
---
I slept amazing when I played vanilla. Only downside was I'd start going to bed later and later till I was getting up at 6 pm after a good 8 hour sleep. So restful though, not like now where I'm waking up 1-2 times a night and take forever to drift off again.
---
same here. Its just a great show. i still quote the pwnerer all the time.
---
Don't worry, no one who plays Classic Wow will get a sex trophy.
---
Horde: ease of transport, ease of leveling (barrens for 20 levels, lol), better racials, cooler cities, less generic, underdogs, dances/voices/emotes are more fun
---
Alliance: better butts though.
---
That isn't my map, please check my comment :)

How the shit do you people have so much free time lol
---
They were able to tank raid bosses in vanilla they‚Äôll be fine in classic.
---
Even +5 weapon skill isn‚Äôt even mandatory for tanks. People cleared all content as a tank/dps as tauren, dorf, gnome, night elf, undead and troll in vanilla.
---
Sure for a min/maxer it matters but it‚Äôs not something that is required or mandatory.
---
Seriously. Can‚Äôt. Wait.
---
pre-60 dungeons... why does this matter?
---
Lmao that las picture. Hey OP have you got the source/original image?
---
I don't think daggers become superior until like the end of Naxx, and even then I'm not sure they are superior or just on par. The Human racial likely keeps swords superior the whole way through for them.
---
You could try it on live. Pretty different. But with trials you can get a feel for up to 5 for free
---
One of these sounds like what you're looking for:

I‚Äôm currently preoccupying myself by building more custom mechanical keyboards... at this rate I‚Äôm going to have one for every day of the week by launch

And? That somehow detracts from him building this awesome tournament? You're a tool.

I get it but I'm playing with other people all the time. I've grouped with everyone I have run across. How is it any different if I were solo?
---
Wintergrasp is my all-time fave.

How do you get 1.2% hit chance from 5 weapon skill?
---
Only a few months left...
---
aye respectfully. Leave him alone. The spirit of classic is playing a game the way you want to play.

Not sure about zones but I love and hate BRD with my entire soul

Personally, I'd prefer picking up my drink.

It was dwarf with a boomstick or nothing for me.  I was like world of whatever till I saw a preview of a dwarf hunter in a magazine back in like 2003.  I wanted to roll around that drunk bearded bastard, so I did.
---
And for classic his coming back with a vengeance.
---
Plus BG queues will be non existent for Alliance.  Just put a PvP crew together and start farming honor.
---
Are you Alpha? Horde. Are you beta? Alliance.
---
Have you decided on classes?
---
dopeeeee. love it
---
This.  Same.  I got into raiding late in vanilla, and went into MC.  Read some guides telling me to use decursive, so went to get it, but found out it had been broken in a recent patch.  There was a replacement, but it did not do the work for you.  Basically all it did was help you track who needed a decurse.
---
&gt; Keep in mind video games are for kids.
---
fuck that. Kids don't have any money. Video games are what they are today because of adults pouring billions of dollars and millions of hours worth of time into it over the last 35 years. Kids that were 5 playing games are 40 now. Should they just give up something they've been passionate about for 3 decades because they aren't kids anymore?  
---
&gt; You will see kids in every video game until you're dead. 
---
Because $15 a month for unlimited occupied time is the cheapest baby sitter any fucking where. Since this form of entertainment if for "kids". What the fuck should grown ups do with their free time between 8pm and midnight when the kids are sleep? Watch CNN and candles burn? Fuck off with that dumb ass assessment.
---
using your logic. Movies are for kids. So they should be cheaper. Because you can't afford it. Hell. It's an adult fiscal decision to play games. $15 a month...no bars, movie theater, bingo parlor cost that little in terms of cost per hour. hell parking at free beaches cost more than $15 a month. Parking your car in any downtown more than 5x week cost more than $15.
---
I've always played Horde, I think my highest level character on alliance was like 20 or something. Raided all the way in Vanilla, TBC. This time I'm going Alliance just for a different experience.
---
Dope! Have a gallery? That sounds super cool
---
Is this Redridge?
---
Fire boss and the pally boss.  Evaded most of the mobs, by unlocking the door, and running through them and jumping out the window.  Mobs reset.  Killed or dodged the fire elementals.  Then killed the fire boss at the dark forge then pulled the pally boss solo.
---
Note this is after I was fully MC geared.  It's also better geared to a duo run with a druid or rogue than solo, but I did it solo to prove that it can be done.
---
People buy other games, 3 months of wow subscription can buy you any triple a title making it one of the most expensive games to play lol but if blizzard wants to create two dead games without reimbursement it's fine with me.
---
It will happen.
---
Honestly WoW has one of the priciest subscriptions costs of any monthly mmo i've played. But the countless hours of enjoyment make it worth while.
---
I don't think they'll ever seperate subscription costs, similar to runescape, it supports both the current RuneScape 3 and Old School RuneScape, even though most people with a subscription play OSRS.
---
It will just split the community even more if they split subs.
---
No it isn't. There are many ways to play the game in a very toxic way, some of them will even get you banned.
---
While that might work for plants and ores, stuff like leather will be available on all layers, so there will be a lot of it around, thus decreasing its value. The same holds true for [The Stick of Truth], it will drop with a certain probability on all layers, so instead of just a single one, there will be, say, four on the AH at the same time. And as supply increases, prices should drop, should they not? Or is it offset by an "increased" demand by the many players on different layers?
---
That‚Äôs what I like to hear! Small business owner moving up in the world... of Warcraft.

Yikes, get a sense of humor wastoid

Keeping a healing set should start to become a priority around level 48+. If you're playing with guildies, you can full respec to resto around 55-56 assuming you do your Ony attunement quest chain and all the BRD quests on your way to 60.
---
Warlocks are OK on the supportive side. 
---
You do have a health stone (free health potion on a separate cooldown that you can give to every member of your group/raid). Summoning portal is good but requires 2 other players and is not really a "supportive" spell. Soulstone is very good wipe recovery in groups, less so in raids since you have paladins divine intervention and shamans reincarnate. 
---
Compared to mages they lack in reliable crowd control, unable to kite, and have absolutely zero threat control. Once they pull threat it becomes difficult to pull it back off them. Also Mages have FOOD .... it is HUGE in dungeons since healers will be able to go all out on every pull since water is FREE. Mages and druids are the only two classes who can remove curses in Classic and there are no a lot of druids around. 
---
Warlocks do have great utility via curse of elements (I think) it reduces target's resistance to elemental spells so mages can do better DPS. Their imp gives tanks a unique stamina buff so there is always a warlock in a main tank group.
---
So yo answer your question NO warlocks are not great at supportive role. 
---
Really good warlocks can do pet shenanigans and try to manually dispel debuffs with a felhunter on an 8 sec cooldown or use succ for CC in dungeons. But it is unreliable.
---
You're using money to get an advantage when you're alone. That's my biggest concern with it. It creates an uneven playing field and it always has. It should never have been allowed in the game.
---
So for the lazy people, what does this change for tanks. From my perspective, we already knew orcs/humans were going to be the best fury warriors and we already knew they would have the best threat as tanks. How much more of a difference is this going to make?
---
refrain from dumb reasoning, thanks
---
Human for sure
---
Yeah I wonder if that would be enough to make manual crowd pummellers not BIS.
---
Also I wonder if they would "fix" it?  It seems clearly intended that fishing skill determines usage with a fishing pole.  But maybe a bug that it works with Ferals I guess.
---
Gnome for looks üòé
---
You're making an awfully bold assumption that the split will include a sizeable portion of people on both sides, because that's the only way it's relevant.
---
You can also split things in two by being 99% on one side and 1% on the other side. And in that scenario, you're not even a blip on Blizzard's radar.
---
Private servers smh /s
---
It depends on gear, sometimes dagger is better sometimes sword is. Going human you can use both.
---
I hate to be that guy, but I would love versions without the big WoW logo in the bottom-middle. I imagine it as an amazing gift to give to old friends that can hang something in their houses that's a little bit more subtle.
---
totally
---
I don‚Äôt really understand multi-boxing either. Just seems like more money and less fun for not enough reward. Maybe just something for people to do who don‚Äôt have any friends or guildies to group with regularly ? I admit it has benefits for ‚Äúsolo‚Äù leveling (your not really solo) but other than that I see it being a nuisance especially if someone(s) on the other faction starts to troll you if your on a pvp server. If more people were doing it so it was something you see regularly I feel it would hurt immersion and gameplay a bit. Why group with that person or help them out when I can do everything with these two chars I got. /ignore. Like a crummy version of retail.
---
&gt;No NEW players to make up for the loss due to the community splitting?
---
Bro what the fuck are you on? I'm genuinely baffled as to how you think this argument (which in and of itself is ridiculous) is a counter to anything anybody in this thread has said, but you keep repeating it.
---
Even though I have very fond memories of Duskwood and the female NE is my prefered race for Druid, I find Alliance's races kinda bland: human; fat, short human; midget-human and purple human. TBC's the Draenei were incredible for that matter.
---
The Horde, on the other hand, have very distinguishable, diverse races. When I'm in a group be it for a dungeon, leveling or PvP, having the magnificent giant Taurens, the fierce and iconic Orcs, the tribal ritualist Trolls and the dark ~~Rogues~~ Undead by my side is so much more epic and flavorful.

---
**Shaman class**
---
**WotF, Hardiness, War Stomp** are great for PvP; **Berserking** for PvE
---
**I get to kill male NEs**
---
Alliance's strong points:
---
**Better capitals** (Darnassus is so beautiful, Ironforge is unique and Stormwind, albeit generic, is still epic and **blue,** it hurts thinking about my home being Org/UC/TB to be honest haha)
---
**Female NE Druid**
---
**Dwarves** are like the equivalent of Tauren and I rarely fight them first as I find them friendly and honorable
---
Hi, /u/kingydakilla
---
A cool thing about Night Elf is you can shadowmeld when your stealth is on cooldown.
---
Thanks. It's a common argument, but unless the player is running 5+ accounts it's not a valid. 
---
Grouped with a second player: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433762704](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/433762704)
---
\&gt;M E R C S of W A R
---
why are people like this
---
Also, don‚Äôt play on a PvP server.  Getting camped can raise your blood pressure considerably.
---
You are going a little off topic here :)
---
Blood from Drakk dropped in limited quantities.  I don't recall a quest that required a 5 man.
---
It's just you.. me.. and the skinning knife.
---
Hey man are you in NA? I want in this fucking guild.
---
weapon skill raises more than just chance to not parry. With how the hit table works it also increases crit. Thunderfury will be nice, but way nicer for humans. Humans can use it well till after naxx, only to get hunger cold to fury tank. 
---
however while typing this i realize there is not many good axes aside from just straight dps and stat upgrades. Im not sure when thunderfury starts to fall off since idk the proc chance.
---
Sword spec is literally like 8-10% of your DPS if I remember correctly.
---
1 arrow hurts. Therefore 800 arrows must hurt a lot.
---
You get "locked" in a layer. A layer is like a different server. You will always see your friend and the same people. Hopefully
---
I have fond memories of the original Scholomance. Looking forward to running it again
---
How is Consecration in vanilla?
---
I actually used to love tanking on my pally (and DK, yay DnD) in Wrath, and even into Cata.  Ive never been a fan of the active mitigation style of tanking they introduced in....Mop? (maybe WoD)
---
Definitely human
---
Already have one. It‚Äôs going to kill my week off for launch too, well at least when she gets home from school.
---
*roars with pleasure*
---
Damn it! Now I don't want to play wow. I have a daughter, so this hits home.
---
What how? He said "the spirit of the game is playing the way you want". Some people want to scam people. Some people want to ninja loot stuff.
---
That statement is clearly incorrect.
---
I'm pretty sure your memory for number two is wrong.  I remember it annoying me in Vanilla that if I was kiting a second mob, my pet wouldn't go tank it until it got a hit on me.
---
Was there even a way to get that armor in classic?
---
You 100% can play both at once. I have both running and swap between the two depending on what I'm doing. Usually, if I'm doing keys or raiding, I'll que up crafting in classic during downtime. If I'm running a dungeon in beta, I'll just sit afk in retail, or convert my 4k breaths into sanguine for feasts.
---
Ok are we moving on from the 'multiplayer' argument...
---
I would argue, in the case of leveling it can be a disadvantage to dualbox. When a quest requires X drops, it takes twice as long to complete.
---
Here, have an upvote.
---
&gt; There's no reason to use Titanpanel
---
Besides liking it?
---
You should just collect a second set of healing gear as best you can while leveling.  I typically just dedicate my last bag slot to my healing gear set and keep the items in order from Head Slot ‚Äî&gt; second trinket slot  and replace the gear as it comes in.
---
Also useful to do this so you can fill the healer role for faster dungeon grouping as needed / desired.
---
feral tanks were not the meta in classic
---
This is great, I tried undead to 30 and gnome to about 15 without issues.  One thing that would be nice would be able to toggle off the keybinds.  I keep accidently going forward/backward when switching back to wow.
---
Priest is always the best general dungeon healer.  Easiest to play, dispel, rezing, etc.  However, if your leveling group has a warrior, roll a shaman.  2h tanking is the way to go on trash in dungeons and 2h tanking + WF is heaven.
---
Found it here.

Nah, people buy other games too. After 3 months, WoW is the most expensive game you could "buy" which DEFINITELY isn't worth compared to just buying Overwatch or GTAV lol.
---
I didn't say adults cant or shouldn't play video games, but I am saying that adults are attracted to something in which the target audience IS kids, so kids are unavoidable.
---
&gt;  gnome warrior    
---
It should be noted this is crazy fun. Having your pumpkin sized MT tank Ony is just awesome. But fun aside, the smaller model actually makes positioning/facing harder.   
---
PS - It was a common goof when we farmed older trivial raid content for someone to use the Gnomish Shrink Ray on the MT. Obviously a shrunk gnome warrior tanking the raid boss is really awesome.
---
Can you let us know what server you are on so we can avoid you?
---
I never understood why dualboxing is even allowed. I just see it as glorified cheating.
---
Nah, I've run RFC at least a few dozen times. It's definitely not worth going out of your way for the loot alone. Unless you're just doing it for fun, which is fine.
---
What is your first language?
---
We rogues will make sure they don't. Running back in ghostform all the time sure will slow down mages leveling.
---
This is another way alliance is better, because human tanks with TF will destroy the entire end game
---
Theres a lot of us that want to experience end game, but are going to be putting way more focus into the experience in general.  Especially considering the playerbase is older and cant no-life it like they could 10-15 years ago, i actually think thats going to be a fairly large amount of the population.
---
Combine that with the groups that are joining from guilds on retail (so youre going in with 5-15 people you already know, or maybe more) and people will be more willing to work as a group, even if things arent perfectly optimal.
---
Im actually really looking forward to a game like that.
---
I enjoy pretty much all of them, but I really can‚Äôt wait to see old Scarlet Monastery, Deadmines, Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom Deeps,and Upper Blackrock Spire return. I hated how Blizzard kept altering and changing the old dungeons up to WoD. I also can‚Äôt wait to be able to run the entirety of Blackrock Depths again.
---
And if you want to spend your money to get banned you are free to do so. You or anyone else here has no right to tell anyone that how they are playing is wrong. They spend the money they play the way they want.
---
Yeah, this was a bit of a buzzkill for me too.
---
Guilty as charged
---
What gear is that exactly? Because weapon skill being this good basically makes me think that the elitism is going to be even worse on classic than private servers.
---
Can you let us know where you live so we can avoid you?
---
On my rogue I usually ran mind poison and crippling, I always found myself against mages and spriests while leveling 50 to 55, then at 60 it was almost always a ton of warriors so I did crippling wound.
---
Had to google that. It's actually pretty slick looking
---
It's good for farming materials etc. There's also a lot of BiS gear from instances that you can get fairly easily with some basic macros and 5 accounts. There's a lot more programs and mods now than there was originally and most of us have the cash to put into, not just the account but hardware needed to do it.
---
You are twisting what they are saying, obviously they mean to "play the way you want to play" within the rules of the game.
---
Nobody is talking about scamming and being toxic.
---
Here ya go. 
---
I was an 15y old edgemaster supreme.
---
Your capital city is literally next door...  Horde have to take a FP to a boat to the tele.  You literally leave the capital and walk about 5 minutes to the west.
---
They are not the same instance.
---
Why the downvotes? The streamer servers will have over 20k population for sure. Some server will have 1/5 the starting population and might not even get 2 starting layers.
---
Thanks man
---
So being a toxic PoS is in the "spirit of the game" because you spent the money on the account? What?
---
I'm aware. There is also an I terview where they said they're open to the idea of post Naxx content. Both things contradict each other. 
---
It literally why I said "the dev's are split on what to do".
---
classic can be considered more hardcore due to 40 members needing to be together, and you want atleast those same 40 members to raid otherwise loot is spread to thin, unless magically only people who never get gear leave
---
Troll Rogue.
---
just stop replying to him.
---
Careful now, you're going to bring out the Druid Defense Force.
---
And because you disagree with one statement, which is a matter of definition, you immediately press downvote.
---
Thanks for showing that there is no discussion to be  had with you. Good bye.
---
aq20?
---
Classic raiding is different. It will be a lor of guilds in classic - hardcore, semihardcore, friendly social, lvling and so on. And in any time i will easily find for example guys who are farming AQ40 from one side, and from other - guys who are just starting MC. 
---
I was offline for about 6 months in retail vanilla, and when i returned i easily finded a new guild to continue my progression.
---
Yeah pretty sure the Scarab Lord title was not implemented until TBC. But the mount was still worth the effort.  
---
My memory is a bit fuzzy from back then.
---
Sorry, I can't see what's wrong. Care to elaborate?
---
Plenty of ways to be toxic within the rules of the game, and still not be anywhere near the spirit of the game.
---
Rolling dwarf rogue too huehue
---
It's a part of the game. PVE servers are there for anyone that doesn't like it.
---
/ WHERE IS MANKRIKS WIFE?!?!
---
yeah i dont get how pservers try and make content harder, yet easier at teh same time
---
Na the raiding is actually really easy and casual. On private servers people are pugging AQ40. 
---
It‚Äôs all the things outside of raiding that take up a ton of  time.
---
Humans, Swords are superior basically the entire time till like the end of naxx (and even then I think the humans +swords might make it so daggers are never better)
---
&gt; $7 for just classic will give you double the months 
---
The vast majority of people that want to play Classic are going to let their subscription roll. They're not going to play one month and then spend the next month saving up $15 for the month after. You don't get "double months", you're paying less for every month you were going to buy *anyway*.
---
Let's do a really simple example. Let's say 1 million people are going to play Classic regardless of how much it costs. That's $15mil a month. If you cut the sub down to half price, $7.50, most of those people will pay the cheaper sub as most people aren't going to play both. Let's be *really* generous and say 20% of those people want both, so pay the full sub. Blizz is now making only $9mil (6 from the cheaper subs, 3 from the full subs). 
---
That would mean Blizzard would have to attract another **800,000 people** to play Classic with the cheaper sub, an additional **80%** of the current Classic player base, with the tempting offer to save $7.50 a month.
---
What you're proposing is just bananas. Really read the above and take it in. ***This is why they're not doing it***
---
Me and my best frand both leveled undead rogues and spent a lot of time in redridge in the level 20-30 range.
---
Was an absolute blast. Most of the fun wasn‚Äôt from fanning lowbies but trying to escape and screw with level 60s. It definitely gets your adrenaline pumping.
---
I got this reference
---
I played on a low pop server in vanilla. So low that when server merges opened we were one of the first on the receiving end. Even my piddly low pop server was pugging up to AQ40 by end of vanilla.
---
Does that answer your question?
---
No, but it worked. And some guilds utilized the fact that some bosses druids actually tanked better on, and they are the best offtanks / aoe tanks
---
Bonds and F2P brought back players, not the 2-for-1 subs, that almost caused its' demise in 2014.
---
Apart from MC and Ony, every single raid will be cleared the day it releases by those gunning for world first. Why do you see this as a problem?
---
You get 0.8 from the 304 since from 300 to 304 it is multiplied by 0.2
---
The 305th weapon skill gives you 1.2 (a whole extra hit %) and from there the multiplier is 0.1.
---
So having 305 is a miss chance reduction of 0.8 and 1.2.
---
Which can all easily be replaced by taking the several hours of getting into and out of the instance to level up two or three more levels and running Deadmines...
---
Going to RFC as a level 15 alliance is dumb.
---
The music that plays in Dun Morogh and Winterspring. It‚Äôs what I first heard when I created my first character, a dwarf hunter, so many years ago. Don‚Äôt know the track names but the one with the soft piano note opening is mesmerizing.
---
Gotta min-max that invisibility time.
---
SO I had subbed with gold, about 2 days before the Announcement, and being a day 1 account.. I got beta access. Most PTRs don't need an active sub, im going to see what happens if I let my sub lapse!
---
I assume he is worried that raids will be cleared on their day of release. 
---
Which of course they will, people know these fights and will be playing hardcore to claim that first kill.
---
Yes upgraded buffs were not reflected in tooltips and not to mention untalented buffs or HoT's not being able to overwrite upgraded versions. But #NoChAnGeS amirite?
---
No. But a man can dream.
---
So far it has been simply: I enjoy playing a druid, also a rogue, and playing both at the same time is also fun.
---
No player in the open world I've grouped with has said anything other than "thanks for the group guys."
---
I would agree though, things start to change when the number of accounts grows beyond reason.
---
Getting multiple characters going is specifically so you don't have to find somebody but still get the benefit. It's both money for an advantage and avoiding the social aspect. It's both of those things
---
Another thing to think about is how each race look in gear. Personally i think that orcs look amazing in warlock gear, especially the male model, mostly because the overdimensioning on shoulders
---
Shield and dagger master race
---
it was released and beaten in the same day
---
I don't care. My best friend wants to play shaman. We play horde.
---
Basically that will be my character  üòé
---
On this ps, Naxx was cleared the first day it was released.
---
I draw little circles instead of little squares but thats what I was trying to explain :(  
---
2 little icon instead of 50 players
---
Usually xroads npcs become collateral during this.
---
I think female tauren or female dwarf are the rarest race, female tauren shaman in particular are probally pretty rare
---
No problem. The settings configuration is up next.
---
Our guild ran one and he did better than warriors
---
Hi, /u/kairain15
---
Ok so it‚Äôs 1 more intellect for UD and 1 more Stamina for Orc.  Not too big of a deal.
---
What you need to understand is that 90%+ of the other guilds won‚Äôt clear Naxx for a looong time if ever.
---
There will be absolutely ZERO Male Human Priests.
---
A real girl is more likely to play a female human and a real guy would NEVER play a human priest since dwarf priests are overpowered.
---
Timmy your mom wants you to take out the garbage.
---
Took me way to long to realize what was happening
---
I feel most pservers have more worldbuffs, and higher drop chance for reagents.
---
Classic wont have this, plus bosses should be harder with 14% parry.
---
I hope naxx takes a good while
---
I have no doubt the first or second day of release the most hardcore will have a world first kill, most other normal guilds or even mediocre will still be in BRD and MC
---
Nope I'm still trying to figure it out. Looking for anything without too much overlap. I don't think I would go 2 x mage for example.
---
This and the increased parry chance means that Alliance will be even better than on private servers?
---
Heres my issue. TBC/WOTLK class design was 100% top tier. A lot of class design in vanilla for PvE was meh. But adding new continents splits all the high level players off from everyone and makes the world less alive.
---
Damn this is so relatable. Staying up late playing vanilla then getting up to go to college or work in the morning. Those where the days. Now I‚Äôm in my 30s and ready to do it all over again minus college now it‚Äôs just work.
---
He means Naxxramas will be cleared a day after release
---
Thumbs up for ‚ÄúRNGesus takes the wheel‚Äù
---
I mean I dunno. That's just what the numbers are. Probably something to do with being within 10 of target defense.
---
It‚Äôll be nice to senight elf hunters all with a dozen or so variations of the name Legolas. Xxlegolasxx or L√´gol√§s were two I remember.
---
Ah, I see. Thanks.
---
TL;DR: Go Skinning/Herbalism.
---
The potions you make won't really help while leveling. You just won't need them often enough. You have infinite food, water, and mana gems and are a class with incredible survivability.
---
The only thing that really makes gold with Alchemy are your transmute cooldowns and these are only valuable once the more common Essences become prevalent and drop in price. Besides rare recipes, raw materials are almost always going to be more valuable on the server than finished products. The only exception to this are flasks and you won't be making any of those while you level.
---
Tailors can make 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 bags (not gonna mention the 18 slot, you won't be making that for a while).
---
They require:
---
* 6 Linen, 
---
* 9 Wool, 
---
* 20 Silk (or 12 Silk + 2 Heavy Leather), 
---
* 20 Mageweave, 
---
* 25 Runecloth + 2 Rugged Leather, 
---
* 20 Runecloth + 2 Felcloth (and a 92 hour Tailoring cooldown)
---
respectively.
---
When you have 24 Linen and are level 10, pick up Tailoring.
---
Go into the middle of the town Goldshire and yell "Turning all Linen Cloth into Bags, only 6 Linen Cloth for a Bag, FREE!" and stop accepting all trades when your Linen totals to 90. Make the Linen Bolts, go learn Linen Bag, make the bags, keep your 4, give the 11 away.
---
Then immediately drop Tailoring and pick up Skinning and Herbalism. It costs 10 copper to learn your first profession and 1 silver to learn your second, you'll save 90c this way, about the cost of your Skinning Knife.
---
Alliance get two 10 slot bags from quests in Duskwood and Wetlands. 
---
Alliance also get an 8 slot bag from a quest chain in Westfall. 
---
Both factions get one 4 slot bag from quests in Westfall and Durotar, respectively, but we don't care.
---
You don't want to spend your Wool or Silk or Mageweave on anything but bandages, they're all bottlenecks for leveling First Aid and you're likely still going to need to farm/buy cloth just to keep it leveled.
---
If you're smart, these 50 bag slots will get you to 56. Just vendor everything or mail it to an alt you made, logged into once, and then logged out of (you'll have 30 days to deal with it).
---
At 50, you'll start seeing Runecloth. Once you get 5 stacks and 8 Rugged Leather (you can combine your lower leather to get these) and ding level 56, go to the city, buy your next rank of Frostbolt, and find a Tailor to make you the bags. Now you have 72 slots and you're home.
---
&gt; But I can make gear for my mage with tailoring!
---
So? What are you going to make? 
---
Linen will make you a +1 Int Robe, +2 Int/Spirit Britches, and +2 Int/Stam Boots - but the skill requirements for the recipes are all over the place and they're inefficient.
---
Wool will make you some +2 Int/Spirit Gloves, a +3 Int Cloak, a +5 Int +4 Stam Robe, and some +1 Int +6 Spirit Pants over the last pair you made.
---
Etc, etc. It's not until Silk that you see any + Spell Damage gear, which is the only stat that really helps you level faster, and again, they're inefficient ways to level the profession and very minor upgrades.
---
These stats are so minor, you just don't need them. Quest and dungeon gear will beat them and now your First Aid is pitifully low. Just level!
---
So now you're 60, you have a ton of Leather and a ton of Herbs (maybe), what's next?
---
Level Tailoring and Alchemy the most efficient way possible, using your Mooncloth and Transmute cooldowns ASAP (you want 10 each of Fire, Air, Earth, and Water Essences), crafting one of each of Dreamweave Circlet, Azure Shoulders, Frostweave Gloves, and Star Belt. 
---
Then run LBRS, a lot. You'll get the Funeral Cuffs and the Skyshroud Leggings, but most importantly, the recipe for Robe of the Archmage.
---
Craft the robe, sell or turn whatever Mooncloth you have into Bags and then drop Tailoring forever. Pick up Herbalism again to feed your Alchemy for good and always.
---
Done.
---
Lol please, you'll still pay for that sub and anyone else in the scenario you described who is interested in classic will also still pay it
---
Exactly. I remember training my level 30 something rogue in engineering purely to recreate that video lol.
---
cuz the content is easier then everyone remembers
---
stun resist for pvp boiiiiiiiii
---
Im honestly happy we got Classic and if that‚Äôs it then I‚Äôm happy. But I think, along with how I think others feel, is that TBC would actually be an awesome and welcome sight if it ever happens.
---
In a full raid healer spec there are no winners, but some lose less than others.  If you put on DPS gear you get something out of all classes.  There are some hybrid specs that can heal raids decently but increase farming potential by a lot (moonglow, HotW, power infusion, ele/resto, ret/illumination).
---
Some raid leaders will not allow these hybrid specs, some won‚Äôt care.  Some are more viable than others (moonglow is really close to full resto and in some ways preferable, while other specs lose a bit more oomph).
---
Except I am finding people and not avoiding the social aspect. So...
---
Hillsbrad Foolhills.   
---
Thats a strangely accurate misspell
---
Mhm. I did not remember how it was back then. But not many ppl cleared Naxx. Classic was a hard and grindy progression.
---
I play a gnome frost mage with engineering.
---
North barren players, enjoy your corpse runs
---
 For myself:
---
\- Pitbull (I hope)
---
\- Bartender
---
\- Bagnon
---
\- Quartz (I hope)
---
\- Miks Scrolling Combat Text (I hope)
---
\- A few others I'm forgetting
---
I'm also learning to write addons myself now so I can port one or create my own if needed.
---
Who doesn‚Äôt want to play a game where half your time is spent fighting wildlife with knives.
---
They have no cleave, have mana issues, and their strengths are handled better by a warlock or disc priest. They‚Äôre good in 1v1, but that doesn‚Äôt translate to 10v10
---
I would kind of love it if fishing rods became the feral tank meta
---
Rag will be dead less than 7 RL days after launch.
---
The top 1% will always clear it super fast. The rest of us will take our time with content.
---
Been out of the loop for half a decade, what happened to Omen?
---
Leveling actually was still a big deal in Wrath. There was a lot to do even once you hit max level.
---
But sure, it ran out eventually. It honestly doesn't feel any different to BC for me, which also became a cycle of daily quests eventually.
---
Back then was a different time, nobody knew what they were doing.
---
It‚Äôs something that happens yes. Spirit of the game is gonna be different to everyone. Believe ‚Äútoxic‚Äù players are even mentioned in the original wow game manual. Where they even say that‚Äôs how some people choose to play.
---
Yeah, no shit it's going to be cleared in a day by people who knows every fight in and out, are full pre-Naxx BiS and are using every buff and consumable. Who cares?
---
 /me waves at you. 
---
Use that during a raid gathering and watch 5 people wave u back.
---
??? Had nothing to do with pvp/pve servers? Nice npc response there buddy.
---
Any Combat Rogue will have 305 weaponskill from talents - your Rogue example is away from Reality
---
I played on Smolderthorn too! Stayed on the server as a resto druid until rerolling priest in WoTLK.
---
Took holiday from 27/08 to 6/09. Should be sufficient to get ahead of the pack.
---
Unemployed for 9 months between 05 and 06, 14 hour days on WoW, yup the good old days when progession meant something.
---
It‚Äôs the same instance.
---
&gt;	Nightmare‚Äôs Asylum
---
Was mothugs really missing a finger?
---
No new continents, no new levels, new content continues the classic storylines in the classic zones, balance the classes.
---
How's that?
---
The first time I ran into Arathi Highlands (Coming in from Hillsbrad) I had just approached the body of water just down the hill/ledge from the road and the piano octaves chimed in. (It's a section of the Dun Morough track)
---
I'll never forget that moment. And that part of the zone reminded me of a ravine near where I  grew up.
---
Problem is:
---
private servers are a huge turn off for my classic hype atm because of wrong values and overcrowded (and not layered) starter areas ... 
---
Tho i feel the need to optimize my leveling route for my warrior in regard to the nolifelaunch :D
---
Once I get the crusader enchant I turn up the bass on my game because it‚Äôs just honestly the most fun sound to hear in WoW aside from Murlocs.
---
he fears they will be cleared in a day
---
Simple, in order to dual box you need to pay multi subscriptions. Think blizzard gives a fuck when guys like this are paying for multiple accounts? They only see dem $$$$$$$
---
You completely missed my point.
---
Oh sure I've tried three on live and I was surprised that everything seems to work on the beta client. I'm just not really into retail anymore. 
---
Are you going to run that same group composition in Classic?
---
But that's not the point of multiboxing. One guy doing it that way is great but the entire point to boxing is to get the advantage of grouping, without having to find people. 
---
If the accounts were free many more people would multibox for the advantages it gives. It's why private servers have to outright ban it. Wayyyyy too many people start multiboxing if it financially possible for them to do so.
---
theres always a bigger fish
---
There is only "The Barrens" and it's a horde zone so good luck killing lowbies there big boi.
---
It's easier than some people remember. It's also been cleared for 15 years now. Nihilum originally killed KT 90 days after his release, but they had to go through 14 other bosses they had never seen before. Everyone in the hardcore guilds knows exactly how to handle every boss now. Things will fall for the hardcore guilds immediately. The rest of us are gonna take the time we take. I know I'm not gonna be downing Naxx the day it releases. I'm not downing it within 6 months of its release. Who cares if someone else downs it first day?
---
You just said most people are going to let their subscription roll, which is what I believe. So wouldn't this be 80% pay $15 and 20% pay the classic ONLY $7.50? They'd only need 200k more people which is easily the superior choice because even with a small loss they have MORE PLAYERS.
---
One of those extra vivid dreams, to be sure üòÇ
---
Yes your sub time is shared on both accounts. Anyway you extend your sub time counts for both games
---
a sub is a sub I reckon
---
That's photoshopped.
---
Mhmm yeah. But even when the first full guides were out... it was rly hard and grindy. But ok. We will see how many will clear it
---
Yes, you'll be able to buy sub time with tokens via retail. It's the same subscription.
---
You won't be able to sell tokens in Classic for gold.
---
There's a looooot of people right now farming gold in retail so that they don't have to buy a Classic sub for the next 2 years.
---
Yeah, not taking Insect Swarm is silly.

Me and my scrub guild of misfits spent weeks in ZG. By far my fondest memories of the game.
---
So ZG
---
cool thanks for the update
---
Ahhhh need to make gold. Dancing on a mailbox work still?
---
considering the token is literally the same thing as a sub and that is all that is required to play classic it‚Äôs pretty easy to assume it will work
---
Improved poisons. You only run crip/crip or crip/mindnumb. 
---
Rogues don‚Äôt have a dedicated slow so getting that crip off is extremely important or you‚Äôll get kited forever.
---
Yeah, that's the odd part of this post.
---
If the mob is 1 or 2 levels above you, adding 5 weapon skill reduces miss chance by 0.5%.
---
If the mob is 3 levels above you, adding 5 weapon skill reduces miss chance by 2%, and removes the "1% of +hit is ignored" passive, effectively reducing miss chance by 3% if you have any +hit gear.
---
There's no point where adding 5 weapon skill should give 1.2% chance, right?
---
They are on Pservers though
---
Is it going to be hardcore in the sense that guilds will clear as efficiently/quickly as possible? Yes. But in terms of difficulty no. Think of it like M+ without affixes. Guilds will be trying to just finish the raid asap so they can start pushing pvp rank or leveling a new character. MC may be slightly difficult the first couple weeks guilds go in since gear wont be there and no world buffs, but overall it wont be like progession.
---
Nah, subscriptions are actually HUGE deterrents compared to flat prices or free shit.
---
Yes it is!
---
Yeah didn‚Äôt know if they would consider a difference in type of sub or how sub is bought
---
I haven‚Äôt watched it but I may when I get home from work. I probably should have kept my comment to myself until then but I was in a mood.
---
Das it mane
---
Luna is amazing, it's an add-on made recently for vanilla servers. It has a current day add-on quality of menus. Really feels amazing to configure compared to other vanilla add-ons :)

---
Sadly, no. Everyone remembered that they can alt-tab out of the game to whack it.
---
I mean if you do it correct I dont mind (pulling weight as they played by one person).
---
I had on retail 1heal and 3 dd boxer in a low lvl dungeon. Obviously much slower cause he couldnt heal me and do proper dmg :D
---
the requirements are going to be fairly similar (perhaps slightly lower)
---
Imagine playing human in a fantasy game... Never understood it. Most boring race in the game imo.
---
08/26/19 - 09/03/19 PTO,  A crate of monster and anything I can cook in the Micro. Im going full nolifer for that week. Already told the Wife to just think of me as Do not disturb unless fire.
---
That cliff cause so many mining dilemmas of ‚ÄúI see 4 nodes down there but it will take me 10 minutes to get back up... hmmmm‚Äù
---
No, not at all. What do you miss out on? At most you are losing Gift of Nature (+10% healing), Reflection (15% mana regen in combat), Moonglow (10% reduced mana cost), Nature's Grace (Increased cast time on crit). In return you get HotW (20% int). So bar the 10% healing from Gift, you aren't missing much, and your increased int more or less evens out with Moonglow/Reflection.
---
The big change is that you will not be the druid with improved Mark, but as long as a main spec resto is there it's not a big deal. In return you are a flexible tank that can heal and decurse (literally the best person for decursing is a HotW druid). You might not top the healing meters, but you will definitely not be dead weight in any capacity.
---
Why am I wrong?
---
Some people just like balloons man.
---
I think spirit of the game works fine cause spirit of the game is a very subjective take.
---
I don‚Äôt think min maxing, and rushing is in the spirit of the game. Others do. No issue we just disagree.
---
Some people think scamming and being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù is within the spirit of the game. I don‚Äôt. No issue we just disagree.
---
Much like life you will meet good people and shitty people. No need to get too worked up over meeting shitty people just cherish the good people more.
---
WOTF helps with Priests, Warlocks, and to some degree Warriors
---
Hardiness forces rogues (your number 1 enemy) to change their ENTIRE play-style. The regular Cheap shot, kidney, blind, vanish cheap shot, kidney, is 4 stuns ..... with 30% resist statistically (if my math is correct) is a 24% chance none of them will resist(0.7*0.7*0.7*0.7). So you have 76% chance of deathcoil chain fear. 
---
so yeah.
---
Definitely angry. Blizz is us based
---
Teldrassil. Running from the start area to darnasus for the lunar festival and just panning the camera around to see the massive tree you are in was awe inspiring at the time. Really sold that you are in another world
---
what the fuck are YOU on? do you not see that literally both fucking games will be dead post 1 year classic release? it's not even guaranteed that blizzard can play everything else perfectly when they cant even play the player registration correctly XD!
---
Naxx kills happened pretty quickly when it was originally released, the only roadblock was four horsemen.
---
Yeah but what I meant was having like all of available terrain (even the ones that wouldn‚Äôt have sense in accessing them, because they are just plain nothing) on one map. Just for fun ;)
---
Take my $$$$$$$
---
Two accounts cost just a little bit more than a single 2004 account in todays dollars.
---
Probably not that many, but it will be cleared the first day. Also tons of people will farm trash
---
Just break your leg or something. Can't achieve much within 7 days.
---
Nice, I think all the old exploration stuff needs to be kept in, so I hope they fix this.
---
God I can hear that boar "REEEEEEEE" sound
---
Hahaha, I did this too on one of my first characters tbh. Well, like you said, not entirely. But the majority of leveling from 30-60 was grinding. I started Vanilla about a month after launch and stumbled on some guide that said grinding was more efficient, and since I wanted to catch up, I followed it. 
---
I don't remember all the details, but I remember a few spots.
---
\-I spent a good part of my 30's grinding the Venture Co Base Camp in STV. 
---
\-Lost Rigger Cove in Tanaris for a good part of the 40's
---
\-Sorrow Hill in Western Plaguelands for the early 50s I believe
---
Btw, this was all as a rogue using DAGGERS which made it even more inefficient.
---
You are making absolutely no sense.
---
Its active because you have a sub until the end of June...
---
Barren is a huge zone. But once you move closer to the elevators, the corpse run is a bitch and there are tons of quest for hordes to need to do at 15 around there. Plus that small horde village and flight path will be destroyed. Ya have redridge and we got that section of the barren for us to gank
---
Don't assume anything. You will almost always fight for loot. Off sets, alts, etc. Nobody will hand you anything unless everyone is geared for main and offsets, and then you have to ask yourself why a fully geared and off geared group is running content beneath them.
---
It hardly matters anyway because bears put out higher TPS than warriors in T0/T1 and are on par with dual wield fury tps in AQ/Naxx. Can also consume more MCP charges to boost TPS dramatically on demand.
---
the change in stats are soooooooooo small that it will make no difference even at level 5 let alone at 60 (plus orc pets do 5% extra damage)
---
Idk i cant picture people reaching 60 with gear and attunements in 6 days
---
Unfortunately not! I'm from the UK, so I'll be playing on an EU server. If it wasn't for time-zones generally being a huge pain (and the \~150ms ping to the East coast) I'd definitely try NA servers
---
"Inferior" isn't really doing the spec justice. You are the BEST decurse bot in the game, with the largest mana pool possible. You provide extremely solid heals (no you won't top the meters, but that's not your job) and you get the added benefit of being a tank for dungeons and OT for raid fights. 
---
I get that they don't top meters so people think it's a "meh" healing spec, but not everything is healing meters. You provide extremely solid utility while being able to fill in 2 roles, you are effectively an OT that becomes an extra healer/b res/innervate on fights that don't need the OT.
---
Some raid guilds will allow for one SP to buff the Warlocks. Decent raid guilds don't need to perfectly min max every single raid to successfully take down the bosses without wiping. That being said, don't be surprised if you find that some guilds won't allow it.
---
That just means you're good at the game, so you're a minority which blizzard absolutely should not cater to if they want to make their game last long.
---
I am taking off Tuesday-Friday and the following Monday is a holiday. Told my wife to go out of town and it worked. She is leaving that weekend.
---
Scarab Lord in retail lost all meaning when they added new servers with the gates closed I think in WotLK or Cata.
---
Even aq40 was being pugged by vanilla end. You know what I haven‚Äôt seen in retail? A mythic raid pug.
---
Reason being is that you dont get direct pet control until level 10 in retail.
---
yeah I‚Äôve been testing on live since I don‚Äôt have beta access. Figured since they updated the retail engine for classic values that it should mostly operate the same. 
---
Not sure about my comp. really want the trip setup because I‚Äôm mainly doing this to have a summoning team later to host events.
---
All raids will be cleared within 2-3 hours on release
---
No, the million people in the example are Classic players. Ignore the people who only want retail, take them out of the equation because a cheaper Classic sub is completely irrelevant to them. so the 80/20 split is talking about *Classic Players.* The vast majority of Classic players don't care about retail. I was being very, very generous with 20%, there's likely going to be even less people that want to play both.
---
Mine will not go to school or even talk until 2 years, so I dont give a shit!!
---
Interesting, I'd be the opposite. Granted I've always been fascinated with quadboxxing shaman (in future expansions) but I think it'd be a lot easier to have both characters identical and synched up
---
Calculated
---
Some raids will be cleared on first day of release...  You will see ZG, MC, and BWL at first along with "maybe" 2 or 3 of the world dragons.  
---
AQ will still likely hold on for at least a day or two while yelling "YOU ARE NOT PREPARED" to the first that enter it as they scramble to fix issues in their roster/gear.
---
Naxx, well let's just say Naxx is going to be the asshole of the bunch.  I expect it to hold on for at least a full reset for first clear.  Especially since the later release of Naxx jaded so many people who are sure they know the mechanics of the old dungeon too.  I mean, they cleared it before so it has to be easier now with all those extra people! (LOL)
---
Honestly, I thirst for the tears of those in the Deathknight wing of the raid on Reddit and the forums.  This way I can site here and paste... "YOU WERE NOT PREPARED!"
---
Progression will however be faster on these raids than before in general for most guilds.  So there is truth to what you say.  Time will tell.
---
How is this new? 
---
Everyone knew this back in the day. 
---
And it helps, but I think the op is being a tad alarmist (OMG you HAVE to be human).
---
 Yeah, the wpn skill helps in pve. And crazy horde stun resists and wotf help in pvp. The sides are different, that's the point. That's vanilla.
---
I cleared aq20 in vanilla with a pug raid weekly. I would say AQ20 is the easiest raid in vanilla, even over ZG. The only boss the raid ever had issue with was Ossirian but it just took a couple weeks.
---
Being reminded of it every day only makes it take longer
---
Maybe it will be 8 days. I will be very surprised if more than 8 days. I‚Äôm actually very interested in this race I think it will be fun to watch.
---
&gt;do you not see that literally both fucking games will be dead post 1 year classic release?
---
No. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if you were literally the only one who did see that. You've also made no coherent arguments as to why you think this (saying they will split the playerbase doesn't count, because that doesn't inherently kill the game, and has nothing to do with the buy in).
---
Sharding is more complex and dynamic. I tried to make it as simple as possible to explain to my friend why you might see people disappearing and what merging layer meant.
---
Guess I'm gunna have to be the guy that robs loot ;) I joke
---
You're looking at it wrong,  you're getting Classic for free with a sub to retail...
---
Or another way to look at it if you just have 0 interest in retail is you are paying $15 a month for classic,  just like it was in vanilla.
---
I'm not understanding how it's a deterrent to play
---
We‚Äôll see how MCP works in Classic with 14% parry rate considering parry haste on bosses.
---
How did you get this screenshot from May 25th 2021?
---
Brand new account, has only posted here in defense of op/anonymous troll with added troll knowledge, hmmmm.
---
Let's be friends. I also think taking multiboxing to extremes to avoid all player interaction is not in the spirit of the game.
---
Long live the FP from Org to Tanaris aka the 15 minute bio + smoke break.
---
Creepy dms
---
MCPs are swapped in and used and swapped back out
---
Is this why sometimes players would die even after receiving a full greater heal?
---
Hated it back then, hate it now.
---
90 days to first KT kill
---
You know you can buy a single month off the blizzard store right?
---
That "wen't" is really fuckin with me
---
Go gnomish, get all the good stuff, then drop eng/re-add it but go into goblin and stay there. You'll have all the best trinkets from each. Goblin is the one to remain in (goblin sapper charge, etc)
---
Pservers also have 5% parry rate.
---
I mean, technically (if I'm understanding correctly), 305th only gives you 0.2%. In addition, if you have hit% on your gear, the -1% penalty is removed. You need +hit on gear to take advantage of that.  
---
Overall, going from 300 to 305 adds 2% hit assuming you have hit on gear.
---
&gt;And you shouldn't start one unless you have hours of free time. I know it sucks and inconveniences you, that is how these old games work
---
No, you are mistaken. That's just now how life works for the average WoW player who is a 13 year old kid. When their parents tell them to eat, in many families they have to do it at that moment.
---
This guy gets it.
---
I only ever remember falling asleep in Naxx
---
Healers usually easier to get than a tank.
---
"I googled when naxx came out, thats proof my guild carried 20 people through one of the most punishing encounters in vanila"
---
Why i fully support increasing damage/health of elites so gear matters more, especially in raids. Gears should matter more and a raid should be cleared after you have gear from the first bosses
---
I truly hope this is one of those bugs where you just have to re-que to fix, because if not.. jeez.
---
&gt; Weren't scholo and strath 10-mans?
---
It "sort" of was at release. Patch 1.3 capped it at as a 10-man, before that you could run it as a full 40-man raid. I know because my guild dragged my ass through there at level 40 or so just for fun.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Scholomance_(original)
---
That sounds like dirty Alliance lies.
---
I'm making a druid and it's been recommended that I go skinning leatherworking. I'm not sure what the point of leatherworking is. I didn't play back them. Can someone fill me in? Is the crafted gear that desirable?
---
Yes it's easier than a Paladin and Warlock for sure. I think it could also get kinda boring after the pew pew blow stuff up fun wears off. Maybe it doesn't wear off... lol
---
I'm hoping to get a similar HUD add on like I had in vanilla, looked something [like this](https://cdn-wow.mmoui.com/preview/pvw5790.jpg). 
---
I loved having my health and energy right there in the middle of the screen, so much easier to monitor. 
---
It also looks like they have an Enemy Cast Bar in the same screen shot I shared. I downloaded that addon MUCH later than I should have in Vanilla, made PvP against frost mages (as a rogue) MUCH easier. 
---
I'd also like something that let's me play around w/ the UI. [This would be ideal](http://i.imgur.com/pwOWTiZ.jpg), it looks so clean.
---
Those are the only one I didn't see directly mentioned (but it's been 14is years since I had any actual dedicated play time so sorry if I didn't catch some sort of jargon in OP).
---
They should just ban it completely. This is one of the easiest issues to resolve. People use it to give them an advantage in the open world. Farming herbs/nodes on an alt while you run around with your main character to protect it, is not just a "different way to play the game" it's clearly an easier way to play the game
---
Stratholme was always a 5-man dungeon. People just did it with 10 at the beginning because you could and people deemed it a difficult dungeon.
---
Yes it has everything to do with the buy in. Look at the history of Jagex's game.
---
Yes and no. Balancing the classes is a tricky one due to classes being good at PvP but bad at PvE so numbers buffs may end poorly for PvP. Naxx gear is already SO ungodly powerful, adding more after that could also cause a lot of issues.
---
Thunderfury wo t be available till Phase 3 so you will have plenty of time to reach 60. It‚Äôs more important to find a raid spot as 1st or 2nd Tank.
---
And for the levelling part I don‚Äôt understand all the whining. I levelled 2 warriors to 60 (on p servers tho) and it was fun and at around 7 days playtime. No speed levelling, did plenty dungeons for gear. All you need is to prepare for your journey. Alchemy and Engineering typically helps a lot.
---
Never see that green hood in game, but all dwarf art uses it.
---
I loved Grizzly Hills and Howling Fjord, hell, I ended up dropping out of WotLK before finishing leveling, all that dumb socializing and studying in college got in the way, but I loved leveling in early Wrath. Partially because I loved the Arthas story/play-through in The Frozen Throne, partially because the zones were gorgeous and really cool.
---
tfw you call yourself gnomeslayer to be edgy, but your guildmates end up calling you gnome for short
---
could you get away with raiding in this spec?
---
Never knew shaman was not popular.
---
My friends wanna play Horde
---
also can get improved rejuvenation as you will be popping out of cat/bear a lot for a quick regrowth and rejuv.
---
If they want to that‚Äôs on them. In PvP boxing is a bigger issue than in PvE and even in PvP if you watch them you can find which one is the one in control. Kill that one and the rest are easy. Seen it and done it.
---
Why does how someone else plays and enjoys playing matter to you so much? That‚Äôs the real question.
---
Yeah, the system has never seen this before and thought to enact apocalypse procedures. Wait a couple years for that fallout to clear and then you'll have your healer.
---
I think WoW Classic is going to get alot of players who nevery played classic, so not nostalgia...
---
Because it‚Äôll take months for us to get to 60 and we wanna have fun doing it
---
&gt; TBC had taulbuks, nether rays, and netherwing drakes for rare mounts.
---
Those weren‚Äôt even rare though
---
I remember "Nightfall" as the hard mode achievement in  the earliest WotLK raids.  Think it was the meta achievement for doing all the hard modes.  Go me a nice proto drake to go along with it.
---
In world pvp I don't think it'd ever get old hahah. Not sure what would be most fun though! Enhance Shammy? 2x the proc chance. Things would die FAST, especially earlier levels
---
These formulas are only conjecture at this point, we only have some specific data points atm and nowhere near enough data for a full formula. Even those data points cannot be trusted since blue posts will occasionally be wrong.  
---
Sadly the people who got in the beta don't seem very interested in extensively testing these things.
---
This. I fell asleep in UBRS and MC. I fell asleep so many times my guild used to blow into their mics to wake me up, because they just knew I was sleep lol.
---
Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that young, sounds more like a failed to launch edgelord.
---
Bruh it's June 4 2021.
---
Seems like alot of people just have a pole stuck up their bum. What profession would you say is best for a warrior then, I can see alchemy being great for potions, but then again engineering for pvp?
---
It‚Äôs not contested zzzzz
---
easy money = subscriptions = what people want in that exact moment, its all the same for me, but i agree with your points, its our fault because we wanted it / bought it. Blizzard didnt decide where WoW was going at one point, they more or less listened to 15 years of feedback. If WoW would never have changed the game wouldnt have survived imo.
---
MC and Ony are fairly brainless. Most people can get them down doing anything. From their on out consumes def need to be farmed and memespecs will start getting weeded out
---
Just a joke, that‚Äôs why it has the humour flair.
---
For Raids: 5 holy priests, 5 holy paladins, 2 Druids (one may be feral for extra melee crit) 
---
Druids are by far the weakest healers in vanilla but have the strongest buff in the game (mark of the wild) as well as the only armor reducing dubuff Faerie Fire that is exclusive as well as the only battle rez that saves on wipes. Innervate on your main geared healer is like having two of those healers in the raid. 
---
If you read this far I have a solution for you. In vanilla it was very common to have a farming alt. So you would have your main proper spec and gear and a farming alt for just that. So roll the class you actually want to play and make an alt as well.
---
As people mentioned the most common 30/21 spec will allow you to farm thing while still getting into raids.
---
Sharding is complex and dynamic. Layering have more rules than just open a new layer at 2k players but it's my understanding that you get "locked" into a layer unless you group or change guild.  I was trying to explain to my friend why he might see people disappearing and what would happen when they merge the layers. Maybe it can help someone else, I didn't see a good visual representation of it.
---
Worldbuffs are disabled on all progression so that argument is ruined. Drop chance for reagents idk what you mean, maybe that consumes are cheaper? That's not a big deal when you clear everything in 2 hours. Bosses will have 14% parry is a thing but hardly a dealbreaker.
---
It's not just "a different way to play" it's clearly and advantageous way to play, especially in the world gathering or farming. 
---
I don't care how you play. I care when somebody is getting an advantage over others with their wallet.
---
yes but pservers have lower parry chance, this post goes into how feral doesnt have weapon skill, meaning feral has the worst chance to hit of  any tank, with almost no way to stop crits and crushes
---
Orcs in Warlock T2 were pretty awesome looking. I remember looking at them with envy lol.
---
Seen a remale orc rogue sprinting in the dueling tournament and I played since release and don‚Äôt ever recall seeing that shit üòÜ
---
Griefing is against ToS. This player was griefing the participants and over 100k viewers ability to enjoy a community event.
---
He could have been banned or had his beta access revoked. Yet Blizzard GM's found a middle ground that removed the players ability to grief while keeping his ability to play the game intact. That is an all around win.
---
The only people in here standing up for the griefer have some chip on their shoulder about "big streamers".
---
Scientists actually studied that question and found that after a certain number, you *can* have too many rogues, and that number is 0.
---
In theory the same. In practice slightly lower.   
---
What I mean is, they both use the same engine, so should have similar characteristics. But classic had lower poly models and geometry specifically designed to reduce the draw distance.     
---
If you meet retail's requirements you can safely assume classic will run fine.
---
Ohh ok, lol
---
I played horde on Gorefiend in vanilla and Troll Shaman were pretty common.
---
Sure do :)
---
I actually might take the week after off. I've never done that before, and I always try to keep the company first and be "super professional", but fuck that, I work 7 days a week so I think I deserve a vacation that isn't going to the damn Zoo (for kids), beach (for wife), and water park (for both) lol
---
No love for Clique?
---
You have the best argument here, do you think these people would drop their retail accounts after all these years though?
---
As I get older, the passage of time becomes more and more depressing. I'm happy to have August never come lmao
---
T. istabzu
---
Druid discord is saying you do not use equipped weapons corresponding skill in animal forms - only feral weapon skill which is capped at 300. Alas looks like no fishing pole meta will emerge for druids.
---
khajiits and their skooma addiction
---
Sapping is still fun, just stand near cliffs people are about to goblin glide from and let them fall to their deaths :)
---
You can‚Äôt say that Add ons are a must but then say we can‚Äôt discuss if they are needed or not haha. I personally won‚Äôt use any untill im 60. They aren‚Äôt needed at all. People become too dependent on them.
---
idk i cant see 40 people on the same server, hitting 60 at a world record pace, farming all the gear required and attunements
---
unless attunements were laxed in 1.12 and fire resist gear isnt really that important as we thought.
---
I do feel its interesting, cuz its a rare world first type of event because it includes leveling
---
Shaman, hands down. Their healing wave and totems are beast, especially windfury.
---
They still have close to three months to continue testing things. They could wait an entire month before maxing level cap and still have nearly 8 weeks before launch.
---
We are week 3 into this beta of what's going to ultimately be something like 14 weeks.
---
I'm not sure absurd is the right word.
---
Griefing is clearly against ToS. The griefer wasnt just keeping someone from completing a quest.
---
They were interrupting a community driven event with 100k viewers that was being used to promote the game.
---
What would be absurd is to allow one person to completely ruin a community and any free publicity/hype that came with it.
---
Not really a prank but I remember once when naxx in wrath came out the entrance was high above dragonblight. I remember we were all waiting and summoning until one shaman flies into the middle of all of us and uses thunderstorm. A handful of us fly into the wall, into the instance and the unlucky ones (me) went flying out the window to our deaths. 
---
I never laughed so hard in that expansion.
---
 "Madjack has marked you as AFK. Type /afk to mark yourself here or be kicked from the battleground in 10 seconds" This never gets old, I hope this still works in WoW:Classic :3
---
I do. But that has nothing to do with this sub
---
A child getting up and ready for school on their own?  And I thought World of Warcraft was an unrealistic fantasy.
---
Because everyone remembers patch 1.2, not patch 1.12. This often repeated "mis-remembering" claim only makes sense if you ignore the passage of time within vanilla, and the significant patches it received.   
---
You can still view the patch notes here:    https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x

&lt;Mediocre&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvE | Casual Raiding Guild
---
Introduction: "Mediocre" is an all inclusive "raiding" guild. We will have the most casual as possible approach to raiding through the various raids in Classic. If it takes us 6 months to kill Rag for the first time so be it. We require nothing more than a general knowledge of your character and a willingness to put in effort to any content we are attempting. By all inclusive we mean that any spec and class is viable so long as its not a total detriment ( Ex. Holy priest dps ) . Want to Ret pally ? Go for it ! Oomkin? go for it. This is a place were we believe being "mediocre" is okay! While this might be a bit of a hindrance bringing even 10 sub optimal classes will not be the difference in a boss kill. Skill and execution will be.  There will be no required amount of play time per week all we ask is you put your best foot forward
---
Recruitment: We are recruiting any and all friendly enjoyable people. We don‚Äôt discriminate against specs or classes and our philosophy is pretty much our guild name. Want to play an OOMkin .. go ahead as long as its pretty reasonable we have no quarrels with it.
---
Expectations: We are open to any class, and any spec. We believe it is the player that truly matters. Currently, our raiding rosters have room for any dedicated player no matter what class they want to play. We expect main team raiders to put in the required effort during progression that is needed to push forward. We will be using Loot Council when we have a full roster. When not raiding, we expect our members to uphold themselves with manners and respect. 
---
Raid Times:  Friday and Saturday - 7:00-10:00pm Central / 8:00PM-11:00pm Eastern / 5:00-8:00pm Pacific
---
Please note these times are subject to change based on if the majority desire to raid more or longer.

Well we are at an impasse cause it isn‚Äôt going to change. No company is going to turn down free money and not much else to be said.
---
It‚Äôs not that advantageous. Not like they can gather 5x the amount of herb, or skin 5x the mobs. Have yet to see a single multiboxer do anything other than have his minions follow him around and make killing shit easier.
---
see other warlocks succ?
---
On pservers, many do 90-110 hours /played to 60. My last paladin was 114. (all on accurate xp servers)
---
My goal is to ding 60 in sub 120 hours on live. With my expected play plan, that'll be Sunday, Sep 1 at midnight. That leaves all day Monday for those trying to manage it before first server reset.
---
Got a full day trying to punch Ragnaros in the mouth.
---
If you don't mind me asking, how did you afford to pay for the game + monthly subscription?
---
Played a pally in vanilla when I was still learning.  Mage for 5-6 years for hardcore raiding in the expansions.
---
Been debating Rogue, Priest or Warrior.  Love to DPS but can't see myself healing or tanking.
---
Rogue just seems the best.  I hated them as a mage.  Always envied their stealth and openers.  Losing portals will suck, but I get lockpicking.
---
Disagree. I got it working 40 hours a week. It‚Äôs doable you just need an extremely close knit skilled premade group and the ability to run on 6 hours of sleep.
---
SFK, Scholo and Strat (both human and UD). 
---
Ran Scholo so many times I could do it blindfolded.
---
As a horde player from 2005-2007 then alliance from 2007-2010, storm wind was a way better hub city.
---
You can probably get to 40-50 in 7 days to be honest. That's a considerable amount.
---
where my troll-mons at?
---
You need to explain why. The buy in is exactly the same as it was in 2005 (so actually cheaper, given inflation) and you get the bonus of it being for 2 games instead of 1. You haven't refuted this at all, try it.
---
Those are very formative years though. The more knowledge and different experiences you expose them to the more intelligent and capable they‚Äôll be in life.
---
Dude same thing with me. I listened to Can't Stop, and By The Way on repeat constantly because they were the only two songs on my sister's iTunes that I enjoyed. They're both my favorite songs now and can instantly change my mood. I never connected that until this post.
---
Yes they would haha. 
---
I liked playing hunter in vanilla, I've been trying to think of another class that has some synergies with it, probably another ranged, maybe mage?
---
Jesus that‚Äôs depressing.

Sure thing, just finished editing that!

&gt;Thing is the game is open world and free for all, griefing a community event should never be met with a GM intervention unless it's run by or stated from Blizzard or any other person of power, or griefing by abusing bugs / hacking.
---
Not true at all and a massive oversimplification. This would be a very dangerous stance to take and would essentially ruin community driven events.
---
Events that were designed to give back to the community would instead be hijacked by individuals either pushing an agenda (political, advertising, etc) and by edgy kids looking to trigger people.
---
Community events would turn into a gold spammer/boosters/racist/trolls wet dream if the official stance was to never intervene with non Blizzard sponsored events.
---
The appropriate action was taken by removing the player's ability to grief a community driven event.
---
Stonetalon is generally viewed as the horde equivalent to Redridge.
---
Multiboxing to host events? That's so against the spirit of the game /s
---
The best/worst was starting a raid at 7pm and then after the raid some friends want to battleground, and then after that you go to sell some stuff on the auction house, and then you remember you could grind your leatherworking for just a bit, and then you look out the window and the sun is rising.
---
Going to visit family in NYC the day after release. Planned before release date, but I still haven't put in for the time off. Not even mad, though. Excited to spend time with family and then I'll have a short work week due to bank holiday when I return.  My SO would kill me if I took a week and just played video games all day. I do that enough on the weekdays after work ha!
---
If I were alliance I'd rather have a port to SM!

yes, because guilds were blocked by four horsemen for weeks.

The great equalizer in wow is TIME. multi boxing makes things take longer and complicates stuff. The pay to win people don‚Äôt mulibox. They buy gold. Because that saves time.
---
&gt; My goal is to ding 60 in sub 120 hours on live.
---
120 hours is 4 hours slower than the world record of actual vanilla
---
pservers have either TBC or Wotlk nerfs in place that increase the exp from quests after level 30
---
so like i said in another post, unless 40 people are leveling at a record pace idk how rag can be downed in the first week
---
They weren't playing Blizzard's rules. That's the important thing here.
---
Griefing is against the ToS.

On the stress test, I was getting 90+ FPS on good settings - the same settings give me ~60-75 on BFA.

Scarlet Monastery. The Plague/Lordaeron/Forsaken/Scarlet Crusade lore was my favorite lore in the game. In TBC I lost a lot of friends to a server transfer to latin american servers. I was bummed, bored, and contemplating unsubbing. Wound up rolling on Moon Guard for funsies when Smolderthorn went down one day and found a Scarlet Crusade themed RP guild. The ensuing shenaningans tickled me immensely so I decided to join and try it out. I RP'd a lawful evil paladin for years after that and had a blast doing it. I also made a lot of friends, which helped me get through a rather dark time in my life.
---
Scarlet Monastery brings up all these warm fuzzy feels. For me, it's one of the happiest places on Azeroth!
---
It's followed closely by ZF and ST. I don't have the same kind of memories intertwined with these instances, but trolls are my favorite WoW race by a mile, and both these instances are also well designed and fun.
---
A sub that I haven't paid, got gifted or anything and with no trace in my transaction history?
---
/Emote pickpockets you for 4 silver, and 69 copper. 
---
If you played a rogue and stealthed behind someone of your own faction out in the world, and used that macro, far too often someone would believe it and get very pissed. 
---
Most played along, but every so often you would find an angry dummy.
---
Which people? The guys that want to only play retail will still play retail. Classic won't change that. Some people will leave for Classic. A small minority will play both, but listen, the biggest mistake you're making here is thinking that the current player base will just divide in two and that's it. Yes, some people will leave retail for Classic, but there's *hundreds of thousands of people,* maybe even a million, or millions, who don't currently play WoW and will subscribe *only* for Classic. I'd bet it's most of this subreddit. The *total* WoW subs will go up even if retail subs go down a bit. As for balance between both? It might end up 60/40, 50/50, 40/60, who knows. But neither game will "die" just because the other exists. 
---
I have to go, I've tried, read back on the posts and think about it.
---
God damn. That's nice.
---
As I understand it, the timing is accurate as compared to true vanilla.
---
They turn down free money all the time. They turn down putting lvl 60 boost in. They turn down race xfers and a whole host of other account transactions. Even the extremely minor ones. They do that because it goes against the spirit of the game. 
---
It makes farming a lot easier. It doesn't make it 5 times faster? I wouldn't be so sure about that. Have you ever farmed devilsaur leather on a PvP server? It could even be abused to farm honour. You can level a bunch of characters in phase 1 and kill your own guys in phase 2. Not too much now, or they will catch on. Just enough to give you a slight edge. 
---
It IS advantageous. Like you just said. You pay for an advantage and most people don't want it in the game. There was a poll taken a long time ago about this and it was a landslide against boxing. Makes sense since most people don't do it.
---
Yes they most certainly are. I had a shaman on a pserver, it had like tier2 gear but only like 100 spellpower because it was mostly healing, it basically just had some stam int and the 100sp, and I could still melt faces just fine.
---
Jesus, I forgot about the escort...  I only attempted it once and we wiped.
---
There is no level range shown at "The Shimmering Flats" area.
---
Not my capital city. Stormwind is my home.
---
As in speech that costs nothing because you don‚Äôt have to pay for it, or free speech like the freedom afforded my the first amendment which is the context it is used?
---
I've also found that it's just human subconscious in PvP that if we see a gnome and and a human or night elf, we usually go for the human or the night elf for some reason unless it's a class we need to focus for sure. It just feels like "theyre tiny, they aren't a threat" even though we know logically that doesn't make any sense lol
---
Thanks for the work. Id like an easy solution like chardev.org had back on the day. No one else came close to the comfortably way of using a char planner
---
Oh damn! That sounds epic!

There area multiple sites where you can view the different maps in wow, [here's one where you can also look at the Emerald Dream for example.](https://wow.tools/maps/EmeraldDream/176/6/-16.617/19.453) Just use the dropdown menu to look at the different maps and choose the version you wanna see it in.
---
I've been leveling a healer alt that's about 81 right now and getting dungeon groups is hard. Sometimes it's a few minutes and then I'll queue for another and it will never pop. I used to be able to level healer alts easily spamming dungeons but lately I've had to quest too much. They just don't pop.
---
I'm not someone who likes to look a meters, unless something is going really wrong.  I'm more concerned with sustaining mana.  While 20% int adds a lot of max mana, it doesn't add a great deal of regen.  For a healer, 20% int might be worth 5 talents points, but it should'nt be worth 10 and certainly not worth 30.
---
If you want to look at it as a feral spec that has a slight boost to healing then that's great, but OP asked about healing spec.
---
Thinking of taking a half day on the Monday it comes out (since NA East gets it at 6pm on the 26th, I think) then Tue-Friday off entirely. 
---
I think Labor Day (America) is the following Monday, so I'll be using another 4 hours on the Tuesday after (because in order to qualify for holiday pay I need to work my full scheduled time the day before and after a holiday) and then get "sick" Wed-Fri the next week. 
---
My work has a flexible call out policy, and I'm not going to miss until then so that gives me 3ish months of time to get ahead of the game, which I already am now.
---
I appreciate the explanation.  Trust me i know exactly what your talking about done it before plenty myself lmfao
---
What would a guild ever possibly need 18 Resto Druids and 6 Feral Druids for? Does it not expect anyone to actually show up for raids, so it's recruiting 600% more of each spec than will actually be needed in 40-mans, or is it trying to run multiple raid groups at once?
---
That's literally all this debate is.
---
The only people defending the one asshat trying to ruin something for 100k people are the anti-streamers that are mad they don't have beta access.
---
Defending grifers isn't popular unless it's streamers getting griefed.
---
People are mad they didn't get the beta access they feel like they deserve and they choose to make streamers their outlet for expressing that anger.
---
i fell asleep in mc multiple times.  however that was when my guild was progressing in aq40 and selling mc loot to randoms.
---
The odds of you getting 2 accounts into the beta are extremely low.
---
That's because it's part of the Thousand Needles zone.
---
Have you been the one taking all of my tinfoil out of the drawer?
---
to get the true classic experience for an enthusiast such as yourself, are you gonna tell your mom to yell at you to go do your homework while you play classic on your ? after all, it happened in vanilla...
---
Are you also gonna downgrade your internet to shitty dialup and re-install windows xp?
---
Nothing happened to omen but tank specs were made so easy hold aggro against single and multitarget that its nearly impossible for anyone else to gain aggro. Also, many other ui addons (xperl/zperl, pitbull, etc) and even the standart unit frames have included simple threat meters which are good enough for retail where you'd have to full swing on a mob while the tank abandons it completley or the mob switches random targets so tanks know when to taunt.
---
That's what you get for choosing the babymaking profession. Casuals.
---
Priest should go tailoring/whatever he wants. Tailoring is req for your pre-raid bis robes and then again in ZG. Warrior should prob go herb alch for money and consumes

Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep were such excellent dungeons. Quite a shame that they were pretty much de facto faction exclusive. Yeah I know anyone can hoof to them but it was major inconvenient to get to them at appropriate level, especially SFK for non Horde.
---
Oh haha :D
---
Independent expansion servers with the option to copy characters from classic and up (probably for a small fee). This way we can continue playing our classic characters while still be able to play with the people who likes other expansions better.
---
I'm in it for the vanilla experience. When tbc came out and later wotlk, although I enjoyed the content, I wanted to go back to vanilla. 10 years later I finally get the chance to go back and I am dead sure I'll miss it again if expansions replace classic instead of being an option.
---
1st year of OSRS (basically WoW classic) release went very well, you have to buy a sub or else you can't play. Post 1st year to 3rd year constant updates (basically WoW classic phases 1-6) have been applied, but the numbers have significantly declined due to stagnation from everyone being min-maxxed very early (absolutely no new players coming in at all). 4th year big changes happen, free to play and cheaper alternatives to subscriptions are added which saved the game from inevitable death from new, interested players.
---
imagine a 3 man warlock team summoning to help with this past weeks beta tournament. 
---
Or maybe making a ‚Äúnight club‚Äù by having one of the team stand in front of a random house in storm wind. And inviting and teleporting people to a place far away when they /nod you. 
---
yeah so against spirit of the game.
---
&gt;	like the freedom afforded my the first amendment
---
Like that, yes, but not identically that. It‚Äôs contained within the umbrella of free speech, which is uncensored speech. Censorship occurs in both public and private contexts. The 1st Amendment is a prohibition on public censorship only.

Especially as a warlock.

Disc priest was not the best in vanilla, weakest of the three specs.

Damnit! On my part i've played with europeans for the first time on this popular pservers and can say quite honestly that i'll miss you guys...

Except the russians.
---
Same if not worse effect on dual wielding warriors - which they are forced to do to keep pace with Druid TPS.
---
For loot it's not worth it when Deadmines is right next door.
---
The best way to help out is to alway be willing to help run the Pre-BIS runs. To do that, you need to be up for tanking LBRS (For the key), UBRS (everything), BRD (Healer mace, ironfoe, diamonds, etc), STRATH, SCHOLO, etc. Your guildies will be forever grateful. Seriously, tanking these places over and over and over again, ad naseum, for all your guildies so they can gear up is a bigger help than assisting with crafting. You will also need your stuff from there as well, so it's a win-win as well. 
---
Until it isn't. Because at a certain point you will have everything you want or need and you will still need to be tanking these places for folks who need gear from there. Over and over for weeks on end. THIS is where your greatest contribution will come from, and the folks who see you doing this will be forever grateful to you as a result. Because doing this is necessary for a well-prepared raiding guild, and selfless people who play tanks are priceless.
---
Yeah, I'm one of them. Played once when I was young for a week during crusade but was too dumb to play without help. Picked it up again for bfa and got bored after I leveled. Really looking forward to classic.
---
You're literally just flat out wrong.
---
&gt;Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
Yes, but based on the data I'm seeing [here](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table)   even if the SOFT cap for reduction is 308, theres still a 10% glancing chance reduction with 310 to 315 (delta 5 to delta0 skill).
---
zhevra courser (+0 levels, delta0 skill):
---
~10% glancing chance
---
~4-5% glance dmg reduction
---
target at +1 level (delta5 skill):
---
~20% glance chance
---
~4-5 glance dmg reduc
---
Please let me know if I'm misintepreting. If I am understanding this correctly, going to 315 is far more significant than the small amount of +hit you get, with 308 being a "soft" cap. Basically +skill will have a lower value above 308, but not as low as their table would suggest
---
This is just delusional
---
Yeah you don't need to be a dick and deliberately misinterpret what he's saying. Obviously nobody cares about ilvl, people care about power-level. ilvl is not always relevant in classic, from a power-level perspective. Many bis items are lower ilvl, yet provide the most power for the character. So, ilvl may as well not exist. That's all he's saying.

Current world record holder has improved his own time to 94 hours, and expects to do a sub 100 hour on live.
---
&gt;pservers have either TBC or Wotlk nerfs in place that increase the exp from quests after level 30
---
Incorrect. That was fixed March of 2018, these 90 hour times were done **after** the fix.
---
&gt; been done on every pserver.
---
this wont be a pserver

Too short sighted.

Procreate and get them little farmers out there picking herbs, mining and fishing.

Yeah, I don't quite understand the drive some people have to clear the content ASAP and compete for world ranks on 15+ year old content. Seems fairly pointless. More power to them for doing something they enjoy, but I just don't get it.

Nope.

Going Druid because I enjoy that class the most.

I wouldnt change your class just because of a duel. If you want to go Mage then do it, if you want to go Rogue then do it. I didnt watch the video but if the Mage didnt duel the rogue then he wouldnt of known the rogue was there and the rogue would of had the upper hand. So what happens when you see a rogue stun lock a mage on another video? Going to change classes again?

You aren't losing any mana regen talents. At most you are missing moonglow. Talent points are not equal, 30 points in feral is only bad if those 30 points could've been much better spent. Both deep resto and moonglow have a lot of throw away points just to get to good talents, HotW is no exception. 
---
Also, he asked about which spec has best damage while still being a healer. HotW is unequivocally the best at that, this wasn't a question of "Which healer does the most damage AND tops meters".
---
This is great hahaha
---
Oh man, plus that dwarf is the first bad ass you see in the original cinematic. First dwarf hunter I ever rolled definitely had a bear pet.

idc about pserver record times....

whats with everyone parroting pserver data as fact today?

This comment hits so much closer to home than the posted comic does.  Daughter is 8 and insists she can't get ready in the morning because "IT'S A WASTE OF TIME".

Lmao, everything will be cleared in a couple of hours, you are absolutely delusional if you think something like naxx will last a full reset.
---
Yea super disappointed in the mods for this. People getting meme's torn down as "low effort." Meanwhile they allow these super entitled and, toxic stream rants to go forth.
---
I‚Äôm taking 7 days.
---
I see damage numbers as soon as the animation goes off. I'm not sure if it's the auto attack or not but it seems to me it connected from that far.
---
You're, hard misconstruing my argument there. You can take Souls games at your own pace, even if you suck, trust me, you'll beat it eventually. You don't have luxury for that in WoW, you stop paying sub, no more playing it, and if half of the time you were playing it you're going from point A to point B, that neither feels like a good time, nor a good use of your funds.
---
 I'm saying that the continued payment should not be for busy work but for content, things to do, actual improvements that matter. Everyone can agree that finding flight paths is fun the first time or two, but the reward for that has been in game since vanilla: you get to "fast" travel. The arguments getting made here are portraying that current methods of getting around the game are effectively part of ruining the game (even though there's only practically one difference, and that's flying mounts. You can argue lfg does it too, but again, warlock's and summoning stones have been a thing for quite a while, which is practically the same thing, just 3 out of 5 or 7+ people get their time saved from making the walk for the sake of lazy bastards). 
---
Sharding is what has ruined the soul of the game, which can be broken down into doing content with people that you've come to know through encountering them in the world. Let's stop getting things twisted around here, let's stop calling walking a gameplay element, and let's sure as hell stop comparing walking in an MMO to difficulty in an action/adventure game because there's a very, very large gap there.
---
But think how much more can you achieve in, say, 2 months, mm...

38/M/US Warlock main, Warrior alt- LFG
---
- NA-US  Central time

- Ideally RP-PvP, If not, whatever PvP server is designated as the unofficial RP-PvP
---
- Horde: Lok'Tar!
---
- Ideally raiding on Sat afternoon/evening and/or Sunday any time. But I can make any weekday after 7pm CST to Midnight CST.
---
- I'm looking for a guild that is social, RP's, World PvPs, Raids semi-casually but will still progress. I am looking to clear Naxx eventually. No hurry, though. We have plenty of time now.
---
My brother (35) will also be joining me he will be maining Hunter and Alt Priest. On live, we RP as Orcish brothers who were born in the internment camps, don't know their clan and joined Thrall's Horde when he liberated them.
---
We're not 100% sure about our new backgrounds at this time, but will be playing Orcs and/or Trolls.
---
I'm planning to be either Tailor/Enchanter or Herbalist/Alchemist on my main and Miner/Axesmith on Alt (Arcanite Reaper HO!)
---
I might be wrong but he may have just been mentioning that they need druids to interest you, not specifically 9 or 10 more druids. the other filled spots are probably other classes.
---
Loop? huh. I just always figured that song was exactly as long as it needs to be.
---
neat
---
Coming back home to the Horde now that blood elves and nightborne aren‚Äôt tainting its purity. Besides, Orcs are my favorite race, hands down.
---
I have quite a few memories of a guild mate (he was a bit older) who would fall asleep in his chair while we were playing almost every weekend. Then you would hear him snoring loudly in his mic, and no one could wake him up lol. We would have to move him down to the AFK Teamspeak channel.
---
You are right, meaning it's even easier.
---
Go play any Private server. You‚Äôll see exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
Warrior can‚Äôt compete with Druid threat without dual wielding which means the new parry values are a nerf to warriors, not druids. 
---
Crit/crush has been shown to be irrelevant on Pservers because tank survival is trivial. So far in beta instance damage has been far lower than on Pservers which means survival will probably be even more trivial on Classic. Before you argue the new parry values will increase boss damage it will affect dual wielding warriors more adversely than druids with huge HP pools and capped armor.
---
Im working out a prep system that ill prep all my food on the 25th, stuff it in the fridge in order of meal, so i can be 100% no life
---
I'm happy to see WC at nearly the bottom of the list.  It's such a slog at level 20 with other people that don't know what they're doing.  Since I'm rolling a druid, I'm pretty much mandated to do the instance though for all of the of the Fang set.
---
The buff is supposed to be removed if you unequip MCP. Does it not do that on the beta?
---
I love this! Do you have an art account anywhere :)?
---
yup.
---
private servers really skew things.
---
plus, you won't need these "massive" consumables that you see in videos either and since Blizzard has a set schedule for releasing content (and you know the content is coming), you can, for instance, farm the nature resistance gear for AQ40 way ahead of time.
---
tbh, getting 40 people to consistently show up, on time, is a harder requirement then having the gear needed for Classic raiding.
---
Iirc you can use a random number so itll pickpocket different amounts each time. Added to the realism and made people very very angry.

did you just refer to your daughter as a sex trophy ?
---
Runescape has always had F2P, so it's a totally different game. Also just to be clear, your argument is that \*other game\* nearly died therefore \*this game\* will die, yes? Because it sure is worded like that.
---
That's good... I'm going to use it on my mage just to mess with people
---
We will see, as stated most yes.  Don't expect Naxx to be quite at the start due to attunement, the Horseman, and such will still be a barrier as it's not the same fight you see on pservers or the newest version.  I was there for the original, and not just the struggles to first kill, but struggles to repeat kill.  It will remain a barrier like it or not.
---
The original Scarlet dungeon series. It's unforgivable what Blizz did to those glorious dungeons in retail.
---
Then I should buy lottery tickets :)
---
Zeppelin in tirisfal glade yes, should bring you to org and vice versa

another reason i don't think they will create a separate server just for TBC.  they want everyone playing together
---
&gt; Crit/crush has been shown to be irrelevant on Pservers because tank survival is trivial. 
---
whats with all the pserver comments today?

parry gives parry haste which introduces a survival hurdle.

By end of second reset is likely.

You can be pretty darn casual to do ZG, Ony, and MC, and parts of AQ20.

yes...at loyalty 1 you have to feed them every 5 minutes it feels like.  At loyalty 6 it's like once an hour.
---
Two BoE's, flurry axe and axe of the deep wounds
---
I'm serious horde cried so hard to get pallies that Bliz broke down and gave in.   
---
Horde was the biggest bunch on cry babies in Vanilla with Alliance envy coming out their ears.
---
Axe of the deep woods and flurry axe
---
I see what you mean. I think I am confusing myself then because if 305 is 1% more extra hit, without the penalty, you still need +7 from gear to reach 8%?
---
Got super lucky and became fairly rich at a young age.
---
I fucking love ZF too. All the quests as well. Made me get really into the troll master race.
---
I just wish trolls could be warlocks in classic.
---
He did play Vanilla, albeit barely at all and he absolutely (and by his own admission) never got to level 60. 
---
This is why people get confused... he's lied a bunch of times about it. When he first started making videos/streaming, he claimed to have done all sorts of stuff at max level (i.e. raiding, pvp, had tons of made-up stories, etc) and was EXTREMELY CLEAR that this was in ACTUAL retail Vanilla back in the day. However, that wasn't actually true and eventually, he got caught in his lie and admitted that while he never got to 60 in actual Vanilla and that he barely played it, he did get to level 60 on private servers (although he even lied about that at first rather extensively too).
---
I thought so, never played a shaman  though.
---
Yup, 2 weeks.
---
An you know that how ?
---
1k on 1 layer is equal to a empty server, witch is horrible for vanilla. Thats why 1k doesnt make no sense it makes more sense that there ar layers with vanilla caps for a good living server.
---
If there are queues why the hell do we need layering if by geting more server and adding queus we get the same result ?
---
Blackfathom Depths, mainly because it's such an obscure instance few know about. 
---
Plus it has an easy quest for a blue sword (solo'ed as a rogue) which I used at the time in pre-30 BGs which was the only way I could compete with the twinks.
---
Ah right, thank you! Definitely remember that zep now.
---
You dont need most ppl at 60, you need 40 ppl 55+ a bunch of hunters and a 60 tank and 1 very busy alchemist
---
Doable, but basically a gear check for you two as it is dependent on how much damage you can crank out before your healer ooms. Using WC as an example - the double shambler pulls hit hard and take a long time to kill (especially if you can't interrupt their rejuvs)
---
There also may be some encounters where you need the full group. Again using WC as an example, your healer will get chain slept by the druids and you get 0 heals all fight.
---
ur list is missing ubrs?
---
 [This](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxtMscbdxVxfoso) is the spec I'm planning to use, but I'm worried about the healing raids part. Isn't this spec going to struggle to heal raids since it lacks the bottom resto talents and notable balance talents? Or will people not really care since Druid heals even when full specced are lackluster compared to other classes, and take me anyway for the battle res?
---
Theres a zeppelin infront of both UC and ORG that will take you between the 2. Its without a doubt the easiest trek between 2 starting zones.
---
/me used pickpocket on you and successfully looted 00g67s38c.
---
Weapon speed is more important than the DPS value. For instance as a paladin (and I would assume warrior) your abilities are based on  weapons dmg values and not he dps so the slower the weapon the higher the top end dmg value would be. So even though that 2her from ZF has similar DPS to LBRS weapons, LBRS weapons will have a higher swing time and therefor a higher weapon dmg top end.
---
Bobby B faces his arch-nemesis, circa 298 AC
---
Tbh the two bis would be Ironfoe MH and Felstriker OH
---
These are really great, thanks for providing them/compiling them.
---
The amount of influence anime has on WoW now.. Two bombs clearly wasn't enough.
---
I have more faith in WoW compared to what happened to RS in the past but this could easily happen. Aren't these the only two companies that have done this so we only have 1 sample size right? It's hard to predict both ways. Also f2p on MAIN runescape (dead game rn) are the same as free trials in retail wow. OSRS had more options but classic seems to have 0 other options. That's the difference.
---
Because people think it's "harder", so by the logic if they can do it on private servers they can do it on vanilla. Even though there's a decent amount of changes between the two, including many that we haven't seen yet.
---
lol me so smert me no reed ful post
---
 **Are addons the reason why the first raids will be too easy?** 
---
No. The state of the game by 1.12.1 is what will make early raids way too easy. More debuff slots, changes to threat generation, classes were reworked throughout vanilla and are more powerful, many items had their stats tweaked and buffed by 1.12.1, etc.
---
Classic is based on 1.12.1. That means class balance as it was at that point, itemization as it was at that point, threat mechanics as it was at that point, debuff slots as it was at that point. Early raids suffered death by a thousand papercuts, so to speak. Unless Blizzard recreates original patch progression (they are missing a lot of data and admitted version control was not a strong point early on), early content is going to be significantly easier than intended.
---
Addons are not the problem. Changes made throughout the game, to core gameplay mechanics, are the "problem". I'd rather see old content buffed to retain some of its intended gameplay and feel than see then get rid of addons, which were available throughout vanilla.
---
Love this. My brother and cousin (the two I've played with since '05) have played alliance since that time through present. We are going Horde for a fresh experience. I'm actually really excited, not because of the faction change, but because we will be kids again in a whole new story-line.
---
So your theory is pservers got the first 30 levels right but the last 30 wrong?
---
what are real classes for u?:D i wanna know,never played wow till endgame
---
are rogues okay?will they get invited to raids?
---
Nope, it makes this whole experience go by that much slower to have an ever present eye on it. 
---
Just get real into your job or whatever, work out super fucking hard so you're balls tired, and go to bed early. Repeat for 3 months to make this shit go by fast.
---
Yes, but for example if you were rolling rogue and went to mulgore there is no rogue trainer
---
I won‚Äôt be taking a week off and I will still be ahead of the curve because people are terrible at Vanilla. I bet most people won‚Äôt hit 60 in even a reasonable timeframe. 
---
Lessons learned from EQ and vanilla are that persistence and burnout are the biggest hurdles. If you can force yourself to keep killing mobs non stop as you move from quest to quest you‚Äôll be ahead of most.
---
Multiboxing isn't just about playing the game in some special way. Let's be serious about it. You pay the extra money for an advantage. An advantage over other players
---
Naw, he said at the end that they wanted multiple full raid teams. I just wasn't reading well.
---
It's silly to think that people 15 years ago were not capable of theorycrafting and min/maxing just like we are today.
---
That lumbermill always pissed me off: A big compound full of friendly orcs and yet none of them had any quests. Wasted opportunity.
---
Not only is it feasible, it's easy. And you get exploration XP on the way!
---
No corpse runs if you never die
---
Like 4 guilds killed cthun on 1st week on the recent server out of over 40 guilds that killed a boss
---
I'm with you. It's fun to get context to what you're doing instead of just doing it "because leveling bro"
---
Rekt.
---
I can't speak for all of them, but I have been an avid druid player since 2005. Druids hit several huge milestones at 10, 20, 30, etc. I would say that it's pretty meh levelling until you get cat form at 20 - and even then you don't have great tools available for a while.
---
I would say druids really start to "feel like a druid" at around level 28-32ish when you get Rake, Dash, Ferocious Bite, Tiger's Fury, Challenging Roar, Tranquility, Abolish Poison, etc.
---
After that point it only gets better and soloing gets super fun once you realize how large your toolkit is and learn how to use it properly!
---
But be warned that if you play a shaman in undead zones you'll have to travel back in orc/troll/tauren lands. :)
---
About 20-30.
---
Anyone know an addon that shows how much im healing on allies? It doesnt seem like that is in the default game outside of looking in the combat log
---
This average MMO player has one trick that Blizzard doesn't want you too know about!
---
The downranking only works if you have +healing gear since how bonuses translate into the actual increase to the healing spell. Plus druids lack a Resurrection spell ..... not very good for 5 man content. 
---
Priests are great pre 60 since you are using the same gear and even in shadow spec you are ok healer as long as you use 5 sec rule. 
---
Shaman struggle early one since they have NO mana regen at all. So if you are enh in healing gear you will still struggle. But the game-play is more engaging and has higher skill cap.
---
hey man if you try hard you can heal and off tank very successfully as a druid
---
i plan on doing this. Warrior + something else. so it's really not hard to set-up?
---
Thank you! And, damn, that's a lot of hit. Is it even feasible to aim for 16% hit pre-raid? Feels like I'd have to run hit on every piece of gear.
---
I have a week that I might use for it. But probably not. A couple hours a day is more than enough wow time. I'd burn out real quick playing it all day.
---
Unless a boss is bugged naxx is being cleared within 4 hours of launch
---
I dont like what u r saying reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee stop it
---
If you roll orc its deep wounds and flurry
---
So Flurry Axe &gt; Felstriker?
---
Okay but you still haven't said why you've concluded that classic will die in 1 year because it is identical to the game that exclusively gained subscribers over 2 years. Literally nothing indicates that it will die and your argument boils down to a false equivalence.
---
Is this guy in a beta then? Thanks for the link and the other info, I really appreciate it!
---
What about Gressil, Hungering Cold, Iblis, and kingsfall? I thought naxx had lots of better stuff.
---
Lol gives us the game so you guys can play instead of this rain man level theory crafting XD
---
Hmmm...
---
*downvotes*
---
I'm doing my part!
---
exactly. Classic exists as-is because they figured out how to get the current system to run the old code (thanks Omar). There is bound to be plenty of hiccups, beta is for much more than just server stability.
---
We'll keep it in mind!
---
Pserver information is perfectly relevant as long as we know what the specific differences are going to be compared to Classic, which for the most part we now do. ‚ÄúBut but but private server!‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to let you win the argument by saying the entire 1.12 meta is going to be tossed.
---
The best recreation we have if vanilla at the moment says druids will survive just fine, and the new values for parry are a bigger burden for warriors than druids. Parry/haste will affect dual wielding warrior tanks more or at worst equal to Druid tanks. Keep trying.
---
Thanks for your kind words :D
---
No warriors actually try to farm felstriker for prebis, it's just not worth the effort
---
I wouldn't set my heart on any of the rare drop chance one handers like ironfoe / felstriker. Consider yourself very lucky if you get them. I would honeslty shoot for an Annihilator for one of your weapon slots. It's a BoE craftable from a master axe smith and will be useful through all raid tiers. It has an armor debuff that stacks up to 3 times, reducing mob armor by 200 for 45 seconds each time. This debuff stacks with sunder armor and faerie fire. This armor reduction will boost your raids DPS substantially.
---
It is cheating in most people's eyes. This specific thread isn't a good representation of that. There have been many polls throughout the years showing the community disliking it. 
---
They are paying extra money to get an advantage. It's along the same vein as buying a level 30 boost. Or "level 10% slower but get a second character boosted".
---
Okay, so if you look at the ‚Äúover 40 guilds‚Äù that took part in opening of AQ40, 10% of them killed the end boss. There probably were another 40+ guilds who didn‚Äôt attempt to enter AQ40 within the first week. Seems like it‚Äôs right on par.
---
Problem with this idea is world buffs and consumes, they make you more than 2x as strong so if you buff everything to their lvl no non hardcore guild would ever have a chance
---
Its not that hard of a journey for horde IMO.  Maybe a half an hour of running?  I don't think its that bad either way.
---
Druids are OK pre 60, no Resurrection really hurts them in 5 man. They do have a good 30/21 spec for healing and tanking/DPS but you will still need two sets of gear.
---
Shaman struggle early on since they have NO mana regen at all. So if you are enh in healing gear you will still struggle. But the game-play is more engaging and has higher skill cap.
---
Yeah looks like you‚Äôre right! I never realized lol.
---
That was one of the developers. He is hardly in a decision making position. ;)
---
I'm sure they were all caught up in the moment and the Blizzard mantra of "we are listening to our players" played some part too.
---
However I'd be *extremely* surprised if they did anything else but bring TBC (and later Wrath) servers. It is a no brainer for them. Relatively low effort, high reward. There are many players who'd be interested.
---
Trying to start an alternate WoW timeline from Vanilla is a fool's errand. There are as many opinions as there are players on what would be good for the game. The original designers have mostly left. The potential customer base is also not that large. Here it can seem like that everyone and their dog will play Classic and I'm sure it'll have a very healthy playerbase. But for a few hundred thousand players it's not worth it for Blizzard to gamble.
---
There are already 3 votes for this combo. I think I'll be doing just that. How long should I hold on to the Flurry Axe? All the way to Naxx or AQ40 or nah?
---
!remindMe 86 days
---
Same. It's so beautiful.
---
this is pretty and all, but to me it isn't much use.  What would be a useful map is one with all the discovery bounds highlighted and named.  If I could explore areas and map my world map that would be useful.  Since in classic there is no achievements for exploring maps, something either in image or addon form would be useful to me.  Maybe there is an addon people use in the pservers already that tells them where to explore or what areas of the zone are yet unexplored.
---
It's easy with isboxer but it's a paid app. I've read there are free alternatives but this one works 100% right now.
---
Try it on retail first. 
---
There is a wizard that will build your two person team and create the window layout. The app launches both clients, you login and it's done. You just have to memorize the keyboard commands to follow/assist/etc.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt speak so soon about them turning down free money on the shop.
---
Ya you should. There's tons of people who didn't get an invite. Kinda sad that somebody got two spots.
---
Im doing "The Cure" undead shadow priest, hope a few people get it.
---
Can you PM me the name of the server you choose in August?
---
I dont want to accidentally pick the same one as you
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#
---
i'm late to this thread, but could you also send me this info?
---
Yes, there is a closed beta ongoing.
---
Except warriors can mitigate parry chance druids can‚Äôt.
---
Oh ok. Thats whats up, I hope you get Rank 14! Best of luck :)
---
You seem entitled
---
I've taken 7 days off from launch, my boss has 14 so i can't get anymore off since i wasn't even meant to have this time off due to the fact that i cover his workload when he isn't in.
---
Can't complain though, my request was originally declined and my boss went out of his way to push it through because he had access to the holiday planner from home so put in his request the second it was announced and i put mine in later that day.
---
If you need a guild, message me!
---
Exactly. Most guilds on private servers, which are filled with vanilla loving experienced players dont clear the 2nd hardest raid in 1st week. Naxx will be cleared in 3 hours but the average guilds will struggle for weeks or months
---
That's not a Vulpera. That's an unshaven Goblin.
---
The answer to your question will be very different depending on what classes your friends choose. So some classes really synergize with each other. And if you commit to a healing tree while leveling each healer will heel differently.
---
StVietnam. It's as beautiful as it is deadly.
---
This is just pre-raid bis and its only bis for orc/edgemasters
---
I never experienced this but I used to die laughing at a buddy of mine who raided west coast (were east coast) and would fall asleep on his keyboard for an hour, wake up and login while still being in the raid and never kicked out lmao. That‚Äôs vanilla for you. ‚ÄúWelp, he fell asleep again guess we‚Äôll wait‚Äù *one hour later, still in the raid*
---
**Short answer: Yes**  
---
*Other answer:* Yes they can burst about anything without great gear, but if you get some really good gear you will be one shooting tanks with 10k+ hp, pretty fun if you ask me.  
---
Shaman problem is mana and mp5  
---
In raids their damage is good but the dps is "sub-optimal" just like shadow priest.
---
The satyrs there are great for farming...
---
I generally have three macros setup for my pet. A petattack macro, a petreturn macro, and then a petattack/hunters mark macro. Seems like a lot, but one of the main things I notice other hunters in vanilla fail at is pet management.
---
Look at the current state of retail, you know what led to this state? People like you that accept mediocrity.
---
Blizzard should be watched and criticised for bad decision unless you want to end with more wod's ,legion's and bfa's.
---
I want to see other one just like this, I think it will be my new background here at work.
---
its not a theory, pservers used the wrath client and worked there way backwards, wrath implemented a exp nerf after level 30 essentially all questse awarded 40% more exp. This is proven if you watch joanna videos and compare to pserver videos
---
It will just get buried within a day, you cant "bump" threads on reddit. Unless you want to make a mega thread everyday but then what's the point if the entire sub is just daily megathreads of the same stuff.
---
Yup!
---
2019 argument be like ‚ÄùGonna make an argument that has a point or just riddicule the opponent like politician?‚Äù
---
Ya you may be right about that unfortunately.
---
Very cool, thanks for taking the time to explain why I am wrong. I guess you can keep the pet alive if you try very hard. I do not know if it will be a net increase in your DPS on average, but if you are a high APM player, it should make a differnce.
---
There are megathreads that stay at the top forever lol
---
Ahh I feel ya.
---
Naxx attunement? lol'd
---
At least I'm making use of both ;)
---
Tbf for the first clear world buffs won't matter, but for the next one's (and other guilds) it would since world buffs don't have a cd between when people can turn in heads don't they on private servers.
---
I mean... wasn't it already like that back then? Did vanilla privates get it wrong? What exactly did weapon skill did in Nost or other privates?
---
ive noticed half this sub expects to steamroll everything till cthun, and the other half thinks itll be so hard they cant play their precious gimp spec
---
isn't that exactly what we've been talking about? You just repeating it back cuz you don't understand I don't get it
---
They required time to get though.  Not everyone had them because of that, especially the netherwing drakes.  
---
They're a lot cooler than a reskinned horse or wolf.
---
i have tried to watch twitch. i think everybody is a clown. they are all acting. only double digit iq players watch this shit show lol.

---
Nope - they won‚Äôt be hit capped in their offhand if they‚Äôre dual wielding, which they will have to do to keep up. They‚Äôll get parried very frequently and incur the same negative effects as druids. Keep trying though, feeling desperate?
---
Mom baffrooom!
---
I have 3 weeks vacation a year. I have to use a few for family vacations. But took a week off starting August 27th. Already plan on leaving early on the 26th since I'm PST and playing basically 8 days straight the second it releases. 
---
I'll probably take a week off during Thanksgiving as well.
---
Woo Ironfoe looks nasty.
---
doesn't matter. had sex.
---
I'm not sure I have 7 days left. I have the option to exchange overtime potentially for 2 more days. Nevermind that. I'll likely take one day for nature stuff, if I get 2 days off for 4th of July which I might. That will leave me with 6 pto coming up to labor day which is after release, so I could use the rest of the days up all there; est time means I come home on the dot of release, on a thursday. I can then take friday off, and after that t-f with the free holiday Monday. I can save or spare one or two or I can save them to stack for thanksgiving. Not sure yet.
---
Another question is what do if I slip up in work due to my high warlord grind
---
This. Did the Ironfoe farm, never again. Not stop emp runs for weeks, and this on uberservers where you could get groups very quickly. I'd rather farm R14 than do that shit again.
---
Could you share the original ones for these on the Google Drive please?
---
Agreed, private servers served their purpose.
---
Oh, you actually weren't in original wow going for Naxx then, you don't know.  Likely never did the actual fights either then as well so don't have a clue what's coming in that raid.  Good luck to you and your own then when it releases.  Just a hint, it's not the one from Wrath.  Have fun.
---
Lots of people never played vanilla and only experienced it through private servers. That doesn't mean they don't support or love the game.
---
Why fear this? Why does it matter?
---
Interesting, I will check on this.
---
Somebody tell this guy...
---
The enemy paladin has a small dent in his healthpool when the clip starts (because he was hit for 57 damage) and while chance is sitting out the trap, the pala drops combat and out of combat regen heals back to full - and then the supposed hit happens, yet the healthbar of the paladin doesn't move even a pixel.  
---
    
---
It's 100% just delayed animation which was a common visual bug in 2004-2007 as well.
---
haHAA
---
Gotta be STV. You're never prepared for PvP while leveling there but love the conflict nevertheless.
---
&gt; Idk i cant picture people reaching 60 with gear and attunements in 6 days
---
Imagine millions of people. Out of them, there will be all sorts of special people - psychopaths, murderers, pedophiles; there will also be world-class masters of various sports, music, etc. Now, just 40 of them need to be special in a sense of being able to play WoW 20 hours a day. 
---
Hardly unimaginable.
---
Okay. Thanks Taxoro.
---
Could tell straight away you were UK with me and the boys haha
---
live to win!
---
i dont think ive spoken about fury tanks in this chain?
---
however warriors can deal with incoming damage spikes better than druid, druid will get hit way more often come live, so would fury tanks but fury tanks can switch to a shield (like they are supposed to during big damage periods)
---
This is the million dollar question. How do you take the + improvements from TBC/Wotlk and layer them onto Classic without chunking the player base in half and/or driving the #nochanges crowd away?
---
It's a fascinating discussion. Maybe the answer is a whole new game which incorporates the best of all worlds.
---
If they can somehow solve this, they will be gods in the gaming world.
---
dont listen to these idiots, these are people who think life should be fair
---
ok that is sick

Our second child is due the 1st week of September, took some time off to 'be with the wife' (if work asks)... just hope the little fella doesn't arrive two weeks early...
---
I loved all the dungeons, but dire maul was the best. Running out to grab the arena event or mess with alliance doing it. Using mind soothe and wall jumping, timing the lasher Pat's down in the garden.
---
It was a sprawl like BRD, but you could actually do the whole thing in one go if you really felt like it.
---
You do not need an attunement for MC. You need it to use the short cut, but it's really just walking once to the main entrance.
---
yeah I already took that same week off. I am considering taking the week after off too. Last year I moved back home to help my dad recover from a major surgery... But since he is doing better I am even moving out again to my own place so I can no-life in peace... this game is already owning my life haha. But I'll be closer to where I work so I have more hours a day to spend on classic.
---
You seem to have some repressed memories. Wanna talk about it?
---
I wish there was another BRD somewhere.
---
Just a massive sprawling dungeon with multiple paths that was never supposed to be cleared in one go.
---
But they never tried again...  TBC brought us nothing but hallway dungeons and it was the same ever since.  Every dungeon became scarlet monastery.
---
how so? enlighten us.  
---
use actual facts and not just rumors though
---
60 for warriors. The play style for leveling is totally different than how you play at 60. Especially fury and prot. 
---
Leveling uses mostly 2hers. But actual dps is usually DW. And prot is sword and board and a whole different set of skills.
---
Who? The stranger?
---
Gear, attunement, and rep.
---
Avatar The Last Airbender :)
---
A lot of us were actually excited about and happy with LFD when it first came out. It's things like that which seem good at face value, but actually end up hurting the core of the game, and going forward changes like that were all we got, over and over to the point of there being no struggle for anything anymore. 
---
We think we want convenience, and in some cases we certainly do and it's just outright better in every way like with mounts in a tab instead of wasting a bag spot for no reason, but in most cases, the lack of struggle kills the meaning in the act. When you slowly reduce the struggle to nothing, there is no point in doing anything anymore. The feeling of accomplishment isn't there anymore. You still get the item, or the win, but it feels hollow and unrewarding.
---
I see. Thanks for the explanation.
---
To get a raid of hunters in vanilla to all do that in uniform? No, thats not possible. As cool as it sounds..
---
For sure it will not be the old barrier.  But it will definitely be a stop point in first week clear for most guilds.  I'm simply saying, if one raid is going to hold longer for sure than the first day.  It will be Naxx if any.
---
&gt; the average guilds will struggle for weeks or months
---
Which is still very non-authentic. The average guilds in 2006 didn't clear AQ a year after release.
---
But of course it's doomed to be non-authentic in this regard.
---
I'm very tempted to get this printed out on a big poster and have it next to my PC for Classic.
---

Really nice post :) I'm actually reading a self help book right now that's all about this kind of stuff; how the brain relates different things so quickly we don't even realize what's happening, and it can provoke both negative or positive emotions!
---
He has an AoE life drain, but from what I can see on wowhead, he could be killed with a group/raid of 60s.
---
Lots of youtube videos also [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3nwTDfy1Uw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3nwTDfy1Uw)
---
idk there are just to many assumptions too make a stance that itll be cleared in 1 week from launch. 
---
one guiy im talking to assumes that the leveling speed will be the same as a pserver, which its not. So some people think they have only 4 days of leveling when its really 5-6
---

I still remember one guildmate from right around when we started raiding BC. She was saying something during an encounter (Curator I think), when one of her kids, audibly over ventrilo, took a ROUGH tumble down the stairs. We all heard it, then a pause, then her saying "Uhm, one of my kids just..."
---
Our Guild/raid leader cut her off to say "go take care of the kid, worry about the game later." We wiped with no complaints, ran back, thankfully the kid was fine.
---
Maybe she was just shocked and juggling many things at once, but damn, no amount of in-game pressure should give you pause in rushing to make sure your child is physically okay. I am sure she hesitated because she was worried about the raid's reaction if she suddenly AFKed, as if we'd be mad about such a circumstance.
---
I've had good success with a slow 2h and rockbiter, but I'm gonna try out the 1h and shield (with flametongue, right?)
---
You know you could just buy your attunement, right?
---
Exactly, heck when I got a 6 slot bag to drop early on I literally cheered out loud.  I have never, ever, done that in BFA.   Even a green drop or quest reward significantly improves your abilities while in BFA another purple has little to no impact.
---
Pretty sure that was TBC actually, they used TBC data for quest exp.

Not mistaken at all. I'm fully aware of what it was like to be a kid. I didn't start things in a game that took 2+ hours at 3:00 if I was eating at 5:00. I wasn't a genius, I was just someone who was raised to have manners and respect. I know it's rare in kids and something most don't have, but it doesn't make it right or acceptable either way. 
---
I'm not saying we should kill the kids for being kids, I'm saying it's still rude as fuck, it's not okay and I will not run anything with them again if they pull something like that.

Probably shouldn't. Druid aren't super strong healers as it is.
---
Go for it! :D Make sure to check out the version I've posted in my comment, though. The head post isn't my work.
---
I hope if Bliz ever considers adding TBC to Classic, that they'll seriously think through whether it's possible to do that without increasing the level cap.  Keep all the BC content level 60 so Vanilla content isn't trivialized.  
---
Obviously that would require some gear/mob/boss rebalancing, and systems reworks like talent point acquisition. Maybe award talent points for completing the quest series in each map that culminates in a dungeon run, or something like that.
---
Anyway, would be really interesting to see what WoW would look like if they could add major new content without trivializing old.

I remember sitting up until the early hours of the morning, back in 2005. I had a friend from my guild I was questing with, we spent hours completing desolace one afternoon and ended up going to bed at 7am, the following morning **:D** Good times were good, though, my parents were not too happy **;p**

False
---
That's one way to generalize an entire subreddit. Cool.
---
Were not actually doing the raid we just securing it from Horde so the pubs can do it..
---
If you aren‚Äôt taking about fury/Prot dual wielding tanks then you don‚Äôt know anything about tanking in the 1.12 meta and probably shouldn‚Äôt be spreading misinformation about druids based on 15 year old info. 
---
1.TPS is the #1 concern for Classic/vanilla tanks.
---
2. Druids have much higher TPS than warriors in pre-raid BiS. 
---
3. Warriors, as soon as possible, spec Prot/fury and begin dual wield tanking for dramatically improved TPS.
---
4. Better connections/no graphics lag/known strats/better gearing/everything else makes tank survival trivial in 1.12 raiding. Also Classic damage values are so far much lower than on Pservers. You only need the minimum to survive and Druids do fine.
---
5. Bear Druids and DW warriors are the meta tanks going into Classic.
---
Noted; So "ideal" would be Ironfoe/Felstriker, but impractical due to limited sources. Aim for Annihilator and Flurry Axe first?

I really enjoyed your tale - but I must put my foot down... playing a video game will never be anything close to attaining a true sense of mindfulness, there‚Äôs just too much sensory input. Again I loved the story, I just don‚Äôt want anyone devoting time to wow in the name of personal progress. That would be quite the tragedy.
---
Seems like existing itemization needs changed.
---
agreed, the 'ending of oldschool wow' with the introduction of LFD/LFR is more like a hindsight thing yes. some people even say it ended with flying mounts in BC, which i can understand.
---
*technically* yes? it was by and large a dungeon, though.
---
Ya man. Keep up the good work reporting all those multibox specific bugs ;) what's the worst one you have found so far?

Wow that's a very good time - that's encouraging to hear.
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong, when it did get that double or triple WF proc
---
Are you mixing up enhancement and elemental?
---
Female orc rogue is satisfying, if only for a change of pace. Wotf will be missed though
---
I mean, there's 40 people, you're going to be competing with a lot of people no matter what class you play.
---
All this time I read that talent description: "Regen % of your Mana while casting" as a percentage of your BASE mana regen, I never considered that it would be influenced by your total spirit. Makes perfect sense! Makes me think about stacking spirit or mp5 depending on the class too. Thanks!
---
Rogues use axes?
---
Let another round begin , Live to Win!
---
Yeah nobody likes them when they decide to hijack a group/bg/trade chat and speak ONLY in russian
---
A guild exclusively comprised of Night Elf Mohawks would be better.
---
From what I'm reading, Fury spec disagrees. It's also our weapons ;) However I think Fury with 2H if you have a Shaman in the same party with Windfury Totem is supposed to be better. SO... I'll just take a 2H and 2x1H ;P
---
Man I want an add on to have these in game
---
Assuming that it was reported by a bunch of people, it will be fixed for when WSG goes live. You're 100% not supposed to be able to mount or use "outside" abilities while in the flag room, on the balcony or on the roof. Just classic bugz :p
---
Yup! I think so too!
---
The 20% damage on instant can be worth it in PvE, particularly for sword spec rogues on Alliance side.
---
But for PvP you want to proc your poisons more since you're probably running crippling + mind numbing or wounding.
---
By fr you mean frost resist? Fire resist is a thing for tanks and that's about it. And you won't need frost resist because you won't raid naxx in most cases as a ret pally.
---
That is one **tough** grind! But atleast all of the boar meats and ribs sold well, on the AH **:D**
---
Redridge Mountains - obviously as Alliance. You finally start hitting some benchmarks of your class, mobs are close to town for lots of quests and easy to grind, other things I am forgetting to list. However, the constant pile of corpses from ganking and Horde camping quest mobs makes the zone pretty much unplayable - at least on any private PVP server of the last few years.
---
Westfall is beautiful and has tons of quests and experience, but I have done it so many times I feel like I don't appreciate it anymore.
---
Winterspring is my favourite zone in the whole game but I usually get there too late and only get 1 level out of it.
---
Nope.  2 Handed Elemental was a thing.
---
Laughs in feign death.
---
Lol what are mohawks?
---
Yeah! I don't like my entire ui being turned into black boxes.
---
Their player and target frames are really nice though.
---
Bug? No. Feature? Oh yeah.
---
Haha perfect choice of image.
---
For those unfamiliar with cats and catnip, the cat is not asleep.
---
Not all cats react the same way but many of them, by sniffing/licking catnip, can get euphoric first and sort of stoned/drunk after.
---
Unlike Classic for humans, catnip is totally harmless to cats and bear no consequences at all.
---
Pretty sure combat daggers is always competitive with combat swords.  If one is better than the other at any stage in the game it's by a very slim margin.
---
It's seal fate that becomes viable in Naxx.
---
Because it's a multi-player game, and if it doesn't perform well, it affects your teammates.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against under performing specs, but it's not hard to understand the logic.
---
have been looking for something like that! thank you!
---
multiboxing wasnt really possible back in 2005 hopefully blizzard will block it because the only thing more cancerous than a streamer server is running into a 5box ele shamans. 
---
and its technically unblizzlike.
---
Not sure about the green colored one but there was a purple/blue one.
---
Easy for horde. Easy for most races honestly. 
---
The only somewhat annoying race to do this with is Night Elf...still not hard...just a long trek.
---
These are always fun, nice to see some sort of age poll =)
---
We have enough bugs frien
---
Loot council
---
I think he‚Äôs saying People that play Hunters are retarded, and would mess it up somehow.
---
It's perfect they should launch today.
---
Female dwarf rogue
---
okay, all i am saying is we cant take pserver meta and expect it to fit nicely into classic.
---
maybe all that changes is it takes longer to properly spec for the proper fury and feral tanking builds.
---
maybe worst case is due to parry haste feral druids get hit-&gt;crit-&gt;crushed-&gt;hit-&gt;crit because they used their pummeler only to get 3 out of 5 hits parried, now the druid is dead
---
YouTube Night Elf Mohawk and your understand.
---
They did. And he left again shortly.
---
Stagnation?
---
Everyone min maxxing?
---
Division of community?
---
No new players? Due to lack of options?
---
No voting system for content?
---
Like I said there‚Äôs too many unpredictable issues which lead me to believe that the outcome of classic will literally be luck.
---
And Joe Mad by the look of it and that speech bubble haha
---
Ya man lvl 30 cap here we come!!!!
---
Hey good to see you on Reddit too! Sorry I won the boots of the fang :p Good luck on the rest of your adventures in beta!
---
ye got 12 accounts no beta :D
---
If you are a tank or healer you'll find groups easier... I'd recommend getting used to starting groups if you have limited time or want to make the most out of it.
---
Pug raids will for sure be a thing like they were in Vanilla, but not for a few months. Same thing applies - you'll have to lead one if you are trying to run it in a reasonable time :)
---
It's the new meta :)
---
some are yes
---
Yes, cater to shitty players. That's what got us LFG/LFR and all of the other things that people cry about.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxf0xo
---
This is probably what I'll go at 60.  No cat talents.  You pretty much just cast Healing Touch and that's it.
---
Out of the 7.5 billion people on this planet, you are so irrelevant that you know the ins and outs of every raid on a pixelated video game. Congratulations you played yourself on the very little time we have left on this planet. Smelly man.
---
Rough in PvP true, but it makes finding a raiding guild much easier
---
have you ever played competitive pvp before the change with WoD launch?
---
only people who are slow, nostalgia purists, never experienced it or who have a garbage internet can ask for an artifical delay.
---
pvp got like 5000times smoother since the delay got removed and you dont sit in CC every 3rd cast with reflect up or pummel at 90% of the cast and cast still gets through.
---
also AT 3.3.5 was sup popular to play back in the days because it was wotlk arenas without this retarded delay.
---
While I agree that ganking low levels who have no chance of fighting back is just pathetic and cowardly, it‚Äôs going to happen no matter what and there‚Äôs really nothing that can be done to prevent it other than not rolling on a PvP server. If your somebody who is sane and doesn‚Äôt want to be corpse camped repeatedly while leveling then definitely roll PvE.
---
Trolls, that's why horde, trolls.  
---
We got raptors mon.
---
my main point is: I think these minor inconveniences of walking etc, while they seem pointless when you are doing them, contribute in an unseen unanticipated ways that end up taking the soul out of the game and killing that "adventure" feel.
---
For example - you point to sharding as the main contributor but didnt they not add sharding till like...Legion? Game lost the "it" factor WAY before legion for me (and probably others that prefer that classic experience).
---
The game lost that "it" factor for me back in Cata which was before sharding. things like the start being super fuckin easy - money being crazy high because who cares at that point (interestingly flightpoints do act as a sort of money sink through a lot of the start of the game). Thats kinda my point I think - Sharding might have contributed toward the ruining of the soul of the game but the soul was already real beat up by then. 
---
I absolutely LOATHED lfg - it took all the fun out of it for me. Just click a button and can do anything while I wait for the queue - don't have to interact with anyone at any time for that long as you can handle the content (which as a non-hardcore player I didn't do any crazy content).
---
Im not saying that taking away walking killed the game in and of itself or that there werent any QoL updates that did improve the game. Im not a purist by any means.  I just think that taking away these inconveniences in the game slowly took away what made it great which is the adventure!
---
I think it will be a lot less hardcore this time around. For one, most people are grown up that played, kids, family. They won't do 6 hour raid nights and min/max. We also are much better mechanically at the game, where we will be able to down these bosses much more efficiently. Enough so that on Private servers they made them harder to off set this.
---
I think it will be much less hardcore than Retail to be honest even though it seemed more hardcore at the time.
---
They can still lower parry chance. Druids can‚Äôt they are stuck at 14%.
---
We need some news on WC3 Reforged though.
---
I admire your creativity
---
Wasn't it? You could always slam two CRT monitors next to each other and use 4 hands.
---
I have no idea how Druid weapon skill works in cat or bear form, but other than crowd pummelers, the question to my mind isn‚Äôt about fishing poles or +stat items, but rather whether the mace of unending life is better or worse than those items over the course of a boss fight. Obviously ignoring that you need to wait for phase 5, I wonder if all that plus AP is better than plus hit.
---
No because that would not be vanilla.
---
Hunter - level 10 you get a pet, easy mode from there
---
Warlock - about level 17 whey you get fully talented Improved Voidwalker and you can actually do damage. Level 40 you get a free mount.
---
Mage - level 20 you get Blizzard and have an option to start AOE grinding.
---
Priest - level 40 you get shadow form and can start using your abilities instead of Wanding 
---
Shaman - levle 20 you get ghost form (insane for traveling), level 30 you get Windfury (let the RNG fun begin) level 40 you get stormstrike (more fun)
---
Paladin -  level 20 you get seal of command (welcome to the fun world of RNG). level 40 you could go Prot and just AOE grind, also you get a free mount.
---
Rogue - Level 20 you get crippling poison level 26 you get cheashot and level 30 kidney shot. You are now a rogue.
---
Druid - Level 10 bear, level 20 cat, level 30 travel, and a lot more abilities in between.  
---
Warrior - level 1 you come to a realization everyone and everything will shit on you in this game. Level 60 and gear you are GOD and you will now shit on everything and everyone. Top DPS, only Tank, King of group PVP.
---
Have fun
---
It's a non issue.
---
In TBC.
---
Used to invite random lowbies to a group, on my hunter. Usually beggars. 
---
I would put myself at war with the Cenarion Circle/Expedition, can't remember. And I would pull the Emissary at the entrance to the flight tower in Orgrimmar, while misdirecting to the lowbie, which would result in them getting killed.
---
They do, but make your attack speed faster.
---
I am a big supporter of this approach
---
As for the stat difference, this is just a level 1 comparison. Would love to see the data on level 60 stat differences. As for the pet difference, yes 5% sounds like a lot but it really just depends if you‚Äôre running demon sacrifice or not.
---
Eh this is the running argument however I would say with a warlock spirit might be more beneficial. Unless I'm wrong but with classic wow intellect only adds to your mana pool, no additional damage bonuses or whatever.
---
If Classic WoW is anything like it was during Classic its going to have toxic players. That being said name a single popular online game that isn't filled toxic assholes? Dealing with people during Mythic+ stuff in Retail is why I stopped. Cleared in under time with zero wipes on a +10 key? Well you are all still shit because we should have been faster. So tiring.
---
Break a cc or pull an add and you'll probably catch shit for it but it's classic so anyone not ready to wipe should find another game. 
---
Protip: Play a healer or tank and people generally give you more space because they don't want to wait for a replacement.
---
Part of me thinks mining and herbing will be a trap because there will be so many people concentrated in a few areas, and so few nodes with long respawn times, that you'll barely get any herbs or skillups.
---
So the point originally made was that Hunters will be entering AQ with MC bow
---
I did not know that I needed this.   
---
Now I know.

Stonemaul (US)- Ennokus (Tauren Warrior)- Horde- Deja Vu, Oblivion Awaits

Something always bothered me about the guy, couldn't pin point it.  Now I know.
---
Lol Huntards? Not in our guild should it happen.. There will be keywords like 'ac', to signal to use "Aspect of the Cheeta".. Or it'll be better if were actually talking to eachother through discard...
---
Where in that post does it imply that 5 weapon skill gives 1.2% hit and eliminates the 1% hit penalty?
---
You're not entitled to that

Thank you kind sir!

Horde Stonemaul (US)- Deja Vu guild
---
I just turn on aspect of the beast and feign death my dwarf in a bush or behind a rock.  Ghetto shadow meld, but it works every time
---
25-40 is quite the age swing lol
---
Some still play. I remember 'Thundar' from my realm, Ravencrest-EU. Going from the armory he's still playing, albeit casually.
---
Nah, listening to the fan base is actually what led to this. Blizzard catering to unskilled and casuals rather than the players adapting to the game. Adding LFR and group finder, removing the need to be apart of the community is what killed WoW since you can do all the content without having to know anyone or talk to anyone. Not having any true bad guys they could rely on like LK or Illidan ruined the game since there no reason to care about the story. Ruining the leveling experience and focusing on the end game content instead ruined what Vanilla was about- the journey to get to the end. Personalizing loot instead of having random drop chances ruined the experience of raiding, no reason to keep raiding as everyone got their gear faster. Do you even know what the fuck you‚Äôre talking about?
---
I quit in WoD because it was bad, so I have no idea what the state the game is in or was in afterwards. So to say I accept mediocrity from Blizzard is just fucking stupid, lol. Blizzard can‚Äôt control streamers, it‚Äôs literally impossible and there‚Äôs nothing that can be done so just get over it. If you don‚Äôt like streamers don‚Äôt play on their servers. Plenty of people don‚Äôt want to play with streamers so there will be a large enough community to play with.
---
No, hawk and quiver is good. Clipping is due to your auto-shot being less than 3.0 seconds while you're casting Aimed Shot, there's nothing you can do about it.
---
With Quiver, your Ashjre'thul becomes 2.89 seconds. So your rotation is still
---
    Auto Shot -&gt; Aimed Shot -&gt; Auto Shot + Multi-Shot -&gt; Auto Shot
---
This rotation is 3 + 2.89*2 seconds long = 8.78 seconds long, meaning you're waiting 0.22 seconds for Aimed Shot cooldown.
---
With Hawk proc and Quiver, your weapon speed is now 2.023 seconds
---
    Auto Shot -&gt; Aimed Shot -&gt; Auto Shot + Multi-Shot -&gt; Auto Shot -&gt; Auto Shot
---
This rotation is 3 + 2.023*3 seconds long = 9.069 seconds long, meaning you're delaying Aimed Shot by 0.069 seconds.
---
And no, even with Huhuran's Stinger (2.7 speed), you don't get a 5th Auto Shot in:
---
With proc, your speed is 1.6065, making your rotation:
---
This rotation is 3 + 1.6065*3 seconds long = 7.8195 seconds long, meaning you're waiting 1.1805 seconds for Aimed Shot cooldown.
---
To get the extra Auto Shot hit, you'd have to delay Aimed Shot by 0.426 seconds. Doesn't sound like much eh?
---
Well, because of Weapon Speed Normalization, your Aimed Shot is:
---
    BASE_WEAPON_DAMAGE + (2.8 * ATTACK_POWER / 14) + 600
---
You get 18 extra agility with the Stinger over Ashjre'thul, that's 0.3402% to crit but you gain no RAP (because Ashjre'thul has 36 RAP).
---
So, let's say you have 1000 RAP (we're not going to calculate crit, it will be the same), which isn't out of the realm of possibility, Aimed Shot is doing:
---
    (46.3 * 2.7 + (2.8 * 1000 / 14) + 600) * 1.003402 = ~928 damage or 98.451 DPS in our 9.426 second rotation
---
Your Auto Shots are doing:
---
    (46.3 + 1000/14) * 2.7 * 1.003402 = ~319 damage * 4, so that's 135.37 DPS in our rotation
---
Your Multi-Shot (single target) is doing:
---
    (46.3 * 2.7 + (2.8 * 1000 / 14) + 150) * 1.003402 = ~477 damage or 50.6 DPS in our rotation
---
That adds up to 284.421 DPS (no, this number isn't mean to be what your actual DPS is, remember we didn't take into account any extra crit chance and there's a lot of other factors in play, they're just equal for both weapons so don't matter for our comparison)
---
Here are Ashjre'thul's numbers:
---
    Aimed Shot: 45.59 * 3.4 + (2.8 * 1000 / 14) + 600 = ~ 955 damage or 106.11 DPS in our 9 second rotation
---
    White Attacks: (45.59 + 1000/14) * 3.4 = ~398 damage * 3 or 132.67 damage in our rotation
---
    Multi-Shot: 45.59 * 3.4 + (2.8 * 1000 / 14) + 150 = 505 damage or 56.11 DPS in our rotation
---
That adds up to 294.89 DPS
---
Now, that extra white attack with Stinger has a chance to crit, so if you have ~30% chance to crit, it's adding about 10.56 "DPS", meaning the DPS of the two weapons is about equal.
---
But this is only when you get a Hawk proc. When you don't, using the stinger is a severe loss to DPS and won't win out against the crossbow.
---
Sunken Temple, but ONLY with people who have never been there before so I feel like some GOD being able to guide them.
---
Irrelevant - their TPS will be unmatched except by DW fury tanks who will have roughly the same survivability. Keep trying.
---
I had friends who were incapable of playing if an update happened and ElvUI wasn't updated. The more dependence you have on addons, I think the worse off you are. God help you if your addon ever stops getting updated, u fuk'd. ElvUI is a case of that but just exploded times 10 cause it demands overhauling every aspect of your game.
---
They start with different stats but they get the same amount per level, it's not like they get different stat increase based on the race. So the difference in stats is always the same.
---
There is nothing wrong with taking them, you are missing my point entirely. I'm not telling you to not take them, but you refuse to accept that I and many others will not be taking them, it comes off 
---
a bit hypocritical. You are ironically trying to impose your feelings on the matter onto everyone else because you don't want them to be left out. But just like you don't want them to be left out, a lot of people don't want to deal with them. Both of those are valid ways of thinking, but you refuse to accept the other side and it feels like you are trying to force your own opinion onto other people.
---
It's not because they hate the lore of pally, it's not because they hate people who play pally, it's because of how pally is designed mechanically. If it's Holy, everyone loves it, it's not like Pally has no use in the GAME. All of it's utility can be gotten in Holy spec, but it can actually contribute in an equal way as a healer. As a ret or prot, it may be VIABLE, but it's just not anything remotely close to IDEAL. So why take it? Once again, it's fine if you WANT to take one, but why should we be forced to accept them because you want us to?
---
You come off as very combative when all we are doing is explaining why we aren't going to invite them. We didn't do it in vanilla, and unless they rebalance the class (they won't) then we won't do it in classic. It's sad, we don't want to do it, we just aren't willing to have inferior runs, and that is just facts you can check with parses. There is no arguing that.
---
I've never seen so many vanilla ret pallies in one place though, this is actually impressive how many downvotes are being stacked on me by them for simply stating the truth. I think Ret is fun, I have not said anything negative about pally once here and it was my main in Wrath. I just stated the truth and get rage downvoted because they are upset at something Blizzard did. Acting like that does make some people feel negatively towards pally players though, and that isn't Blizzard's fault, it's theirs.
---
yeah i remember feeling that was a limitation, so I had a bar of the same macro with all different amounts lol.
---
If someone knows how to make it random numbers that would  be great.
---
Metallica's S&amp;M will always remind me of questing in Westfall.
---
you'll want crip on MH, cant afford to not have it proccing on OH  
---
hell, many rogues use double crip  
---
in the main pvp specs theres usually only a couple(generally 1, up to 3) points you put into the poisons talents
---
Lol for solo play nothing wrong with that.
---
Same reason people hate the idea of sharding
---
yeet
---
StabinCabin
---
You have to be pretty handy with a computer to play them.
---
That wouldn't even be too difficult to do. If /u/Teeb is willing to give his permission I can create upscaled versions of every zone texture. Consuming them in an addon is easy enough.
---
Mrglmrgl bow wow!
---
Stratholme undead, the best dungeon Blizzard ever made.
---
Saying "I'm sure the dev's are prepared" is ignorance - what in the past 10 years has given blizzard the benefit of the doubt?
---
They could easily come out and say "Yup after layering is removed it's possible you will have 6-10 hour queues on certain servers, but we'll also offer free transfers to dead or non established servers"
---
Those are the only 2 possible solutions
---
*Unless they choose to keep layering in past phase 1 - which blizzard is likely to do in order to cater to 2019 people that ar entitled and must log in the second they press the play button.
---
Yikes just another shit post troll that doesn't even have the facts straight.
---
Griefing is considered "unacceptable" and is an actionable offense. What is considered griefing is left up to the sole discretion of Blizzard.
---
Personally this is what I'll be running at max level. You can put a point in improved rejuv, but I plan on being an OT mostly so I put the point in enrage for better initial threat on pulls.

Actually good advice? Especially on fresh server when the economy is still weak. Vendor greys &gt; buy low &gt; stock up &gt; sell high. Great advice tbh
---
&gt; Your aimed shot is a 3 second cast and does Weapon Damage + Bonus. This means that any weapon with a Weapon Speed longer than 3 seconds is actually benefiting from Aimed Shot's 3 second cast. Multi-Shot is the same way, except it's instant, so all Weapon Speeds benefit, just slower weapons benefit *more*. 
---
In 1.12 hunter shots are normalized, so the formula for max rank aimed shot is actually
---
weaponDPS \* 2.8 + 600 
---
the only benefit of the slow crossbows is lining up with autoshot correctly so as not to have to clip autoshots to use Aimedshot nearly on cooldown.

Phase 2 Advertisement has begun. STREAMER HYPUUUUUU

Heh I was thinking angwe, redridgelol, grim, ?

If entitled means being a person who signed the petition and had to endure years of endless scrutiny from people (Blizzard‚Äôs current CEO) and largely their fan base, saying that Classic would be a horrible idea only to see that it will be the largest game to come out in 2019 to resounding commercial success and we had to BEG blizzard to give them money. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty entitled, so fuck you.
---
Demon Knights or GTFO
---
Nice, now all I need is an invite to the beta!
---
If you are motivated enough in one of Sodapoppin's past broadcasts he is setting up his beta guild &lt;Just Chatting&gt;. He spends some time in all the menus. I don't remember what day it was though, sorry. I'd guess around a week ago.
---
Thunderfury was the best tanking sword in vanilla.  It didn't "fall off" until TBC and iirc many guilds in TBC killed Vashj and Kael Thas with it.
---
I will admit if the weapon skill works like people are saying, then yes.  If 5 skill reduces chance to be parried by 8% and increases chance to hit by 2-3% and reduces chance to be dodged by .5% and increases crit chance by .2% then yeah.  It will be pretty important for a Orc to use an axe to tank.
---
But I have a hard time believing 5 weapon skill will do all of that. 
---
I know the glancing blow and at least 1% hit is confirmed for sure.  But how much it reduces parry, increases hit otherwise, etc. hasn't been confirmed to my knowledge.
---
yer right, lets not test the game
---
Please fucking hurry and get the servers down.
---
Ret pallies were fine for 5 mans/pvp back in the day. I'll be inviting them to groups.
---
Come raid time, I feel like one won't hurt, but they'll mostly be asked to heal, buff and decurse. There is so much decursing.
---
Oh shit, can't wait to watch people level more from the sidelines!! /s
---
That is certainly one option that Blizz could explore. But these items are more up for discussion at /r/classicwowplus
---
Some proper testing is going to occur. It's going to be fun to watch warlocks run people down that down have mounts.
---
B a s e d

HYPE
---
15 year old game, doesn't need testing /s.     
---
For real though I'm glad they're finally moving onto the next set of stuff to test
---
&gt; But I have a hard time believing 5 weapon skill will do all of that
---
it wont reduce 8% ive seen as high as 2.4 or as low as .02 per skill (like dodge)
---
Druid herbalists can farm reasonably well by healer standards. Not by killing stuff, but by stealthing and gathering.
---
Druid miner/herbalist if you want to double down. Fishing is another way to make money without needing high dps.
---
2H spec is sick for heavy AoE dungeons/raids. Something along the lines of ZG, where you can steamroll through it and it doesn't require that much downtime of talking things over and such.
---

Here's a pretty entertaining video of a speedrun ZG clear, from the perspective of a 2H PvE warrior.
---
&gt;If there was a classic only package I could easily persuade friends to join me as well.
---
What if they made classic $15/month?
---
Is the real issue the monthly cost or are they just dumb?
---
*I have the same issue with some friends they ask "Why would I pay a monthly fee for a game in already played 15 years ago"
---
And that's why they are morons :)
---
Whatever happened tho those low level cloaks? I remember when getting a full lenght closk was almost like a status symbol.
---
the stormpikr guards have them i believe
---
We need the BGs tested though. WSG had a massive amount of bugs so we eventually need people at level 51 to play AV, which is hundreds of times more complicated than WSG is. Shit needs to be tested.
---
1) Alliance is worse  2) Anyone with TF will destroy the entire end game
---
Wowhead coming for ya classicdb.ch
---
they will go all the way to 60, why else have such a late launch?
---
"entitled" is the official word of bootlickers. If the consumer isn't entitled they are quick to be taken advantage of. Just look at the sorry state blizzard is in as a result of this. Why improve when you don't have to?
---
to be fair it is a 15-year-old game but then how can it kill what has already been seen?
---
About time they remove respec costs for Beta. You are supposed to test stuff not grind gold.
---
On the contrary, it raises it. But I can agree if your point is that they deplete more content. But its worth the testing
---
I think OP is more referring to playing as a caster rather than what unbreakable showed (which is pretty unsustainable). Most people would call this enhancement.
---
If you're in beta and they work in beta then I suppose you could maybe save a profile and then copy it over? Not an expert so no idea.
---
I would say level 40 when you get your 31 point talent is a big step for a lot of classes
---
&gt; Anyone with TF will destroy the entire end game
---
but humans more so

Looking forward to 3-4 boxing warlocks in Classic. Will also give shamans a shot.
---
LET'S GOOOOO
---
Oh shit, we getting mounts now, boys! And increased professions
---
It‚Äôs not irrelevant at all. You‚Äôre info is more irrelevant than anything. Pservers have more inaccuracies than we know. Sure we can use them as a starting ground but they just aren‚Äôt accurate. 9% parry that‚Äôs the difference that‚Äôs a lot bigger than anything else.
---
Harmless to cats and bears, gotcha. Gonna role druid for the nip
---
&lt;me and the boys&gt; should be the official guild.
---
Key rings, are not in the Beta. You get them at 60
---
No, it's:
---
The BASE_WEAPON_DAMAGE is WEAPON_DPS * WEAPON_SPEED
---
Only AP scaling was normalized.
---
Okay wait, I misread. so in OP, 305-315 is simply 0.1% per lev, while 300-305 is 0.2% with an extra 1% jump when hitting 305 (and a 1% jump due to +hit penalty removal).  
---
This seems odd, but that's where he got the 1.2%. However, if we're believing Beaza now, 300-305 should be 0.4% per level, with no extra jump. In both cases, 300-305 gives 2% hit, with 1% penalty removal, for an effective total 3% hit (assuming you have +hit on gear)
---
Anyway for players to get it?
---
To give some feedback, I'm really hoping that you can get the "Stat Weighting" to start working properly. I can't tell from your post if that's what you mean by "refining stat formulas."
---
In my view this is the most important thing wowhead can offer. Without that working properly there are other sites that currently offer a better experience.
---
They may go to 60, but I‚Äôd be surprised if they open MC.
---
fucking yes, what would be the point if not
---
Yeah, EQ has been doubt progressive realms for a long time now and has already gone through a lot of the trial and error and refined jerk approach.  I‚Äôd strongly suggest the WoW team to get an understanding of their approach and analyze it a bit as I think there could be quite a bit of carry over long term.
---
Hype! I have a shield waiting on me at 31 I can‚Äôt wait to use!
---
Negative. none that i know if anyway
---
First streamer preference. Next friends and family preference. Next wave will be original pre BC accounts?
---
Bolvar would like to have a word with you.
---
The hype... are they going to be able to run BRD? Woooooop
---
In Vanilla I leveled on a PVP server and it wasn't that bad, you'd get ganked once in a while but it was rare for high leveled players to be in low level areas. I tried leveling on a server whose name will not be mentioned and it is terrible. Sheer number of bored people running around in full tier gear killing flight paths and camping low level quest givers is astounding.
---
Only two at a time.
---
No because you wont lose threat anyway with TF regardless of the +5
---
His enjoyment directly conflicts with the enjoyment of (many) other players. 
---
It's pretty asinine to parrot "what about his enjoyment" without thinking about the potential consequences.
---
What if I player gets their enjoyment from an MMORPG out of being an anonymous racist? What if a player gets enjoyment out of exploiting the local economy to turn a profit? 
---
Leveraging enjoyment to justify shitty behavior is such a weak defense.
---
Good thing I haven‚Äôt been turning in quests at 30 lol. About to hit 31 quick heh
---
Those are stickies and you only get a certain amount of then, 2 I believe.
---
Your suggestion would require getting rid of ones we have already
---
Desolace
---
but more deeps?!?
---
also as i understand it, you could always use more threat, cuz most dps are throttling
---
Search for what ? Classic data are not that easy to find out, Classic is not out, and it's not a private server. It's logical that many new people like myself wonder tons of things about the game.
---
Also, wow classic is gonna be an old game that comes back out in 2019, an era where MMO are mostly easy with any class, and in which you don't miss a lot of content because everything is pin-pinned everywhere. Wow classic gonna have the same flaw as the original game, meaning there's some spec literally unplayable like Mage Fire, or hardcore leveling if you plan to play as boomkin druid.
---
Also more, there is people that gonna discover the game, while others in this sub already theoricraft hit point neededs for melee. In the end, why seeing a post like these makes you annoyed, you just skip it and you're in seconds one post below, showing their prepurchased game card to show their hype. (This is a satire, I have nothing against them, I just skip like a normie :) )

Does this stand for "Salt"?

Yee
---
Gnome mage and undead rogue.
---
Must have addon IMHO
---
Yes Rogues are good and there will be at least 6 per raid. The only problem is they are very popular so there are a lot of them about, creating some competition for raid spots. But shouldn't really be a problem unless server pop is very low.
---
I wanted to use it as a quick way from IF to Booty Bay.
---
Nice! Have fun

Interesting. Ty

&gt; Most people would call this enhancement.

And they would be wrong =)
---
\3. There was passive mode, that the pet would just stay with you.  There was defensive mode, it would go against whatever attacked you.  There was basically aggressive mode where it would go for whatever you told it to attack.
---
You used to be able to send your pet on one mob while you shot at another one.  It would stay on what you put it on.  They changed this at some point - Cata?  In my most recent memories of WoW, the pet would always switch to your new target.  This was a horrible change.
---
Whelp, I guess I just need to have all the weapons. Greedy warrior I shall be haha.

Weird bloated hunchback

Not accurate, except we know what the values are and how they compare. Repeating ‚ÄúnInE pErCeNT‚Äù is not an argument. I‚Äôm sorry that you feel threatened by druids tanking but it‚Äôs just a reality you‚Äôre going to have to deal with.

They all thought they just relax and level new characters after the duel tournament... NOPE time for a new lvl 40 duel tournament

---
The original ones, without ImgUr fucking them up, come out really good looking (imo). Do you also have them without the surrounding frame? (so just the sea and the continents).
---
Warrior can‚Äôt compete with Druid threat on pservers. We‚Äôll see how they do when druids are getting parried 14% of the time and warriors aren‚Äôt. Not to mention overall hit differences from warriors having weapon skill and druids not. Like lower chance to be dodged, and blocked. Or increase crit chance.
---
At least this way it's more likely for a lv40 tourney?
---
Yeah I love this! I can't wait to try it ^In ^August
---
Correct. I've heard of 1 person who tested who said windfury with the 1h was still slightly better but it ignores the main advantage of 1h and flame tounge which is consistency. 
---
Sometimes you get lucky with WF, sometimes you dont. Makes for a very hit or miss experience and if you get bad rng it could put you in some less than ideal situations. With a 1h+FT its a very predictable TTK and you take less dmg due to having the extra armor from the shield
---
i was just playing alliance and the rogues would always be jealous of the horde rogues (wont take swords and maces)
---
WoW may want to learn, but i don't.
---
&gt;I want to focus on horde because it seems like the lost threat hurts them more than alliance
---
Where are you getting this lost threat? You're acting like Classic is changing things and not that it was private servers that had it wrong all this time. Nothing has been lost, were just going to play the PROPER way now.

---
All right, all right, all right. First of all, speccing into poison skills is not worth it because you will lose more important points in your other trees. Second, for general PvP you put crippling poison on your main hand (slow) and instant poison on your off-hand (fast).
---
STRANGLEHORN....
---
It needs an spell check
---
reading from what?
---
horde warriors have been using 2handers for fury spec for years now.  the reason is simple, windfury.
---
Felstriker and Iron Foe are the stone nuts. Like he said though very, very hard to get.
---
Lol threatened. Planning on Druid and it‚Äôs more than just the 9% parry. What about block dodge and miss chance that warrior can lower than Druid can‚Äôt...
---
But muh pservers...
---
I've heard Soda say they won't go to 60, idk if he knows something we don't but I just thought I'd add it here.
---
I won't argue that druid healing is worse than paladins and priests, but what you said was deadweight. Hyperbole isn't an excuse for making false claims.
---
Are you really that worked up about such hypothetical nonsense?
---
Layer will be needed for a playable game on release because everyone will want to play on day 1, hour 1. Overtime, tourist will leave and the remaining playerbase will average out the times that they're online. This means even if 5k people are playing on a server day 1, hour 1, that server will average out to a lot less currently online players as players will establish different play times over the next few weeks. Some will only play during certain hours(mornings,afternoons,evenings) and some of those will only play on certain days. 
---
The biggest thing to consider once the populations stabilize is even if their are 5k players on a server, they'll never all be online at the same time. The opposite will be true on day 1,hour 1, and why layering will be required. And once you consider this point along with "Tourist leaving", the current online populations will be at the targeted pop for online members and layering will no longer be needed. 
---
No one that has ever complained about this issue has ever went into that much nuance about the subject, not to mention how much more nuance there is that I didn't mention. The devs on the otherhand have gone into great detail on the matter. This is why they are prepared and why everyone complaining lacks a good understanding.
---
Which SL are we taking about? Soul link or siphon life? I'm guessing soul link?
---
When you hit max level, you had to grind sons of hodir rep for your helm enchant, and that was about it.

After that it was either raid, do arena or run laps in Dalaran

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
How many streamers actually have the type of audience capable of what you are saying?  And handful? Maybe?
---
You're that worried about running into them into the wild?  I think you are overreacting.
---
I've always been on PvP servers - what do you think?
---
On horde side it would literally all be resto shamans and rogues/fury warriors for max dps. Maybe one mage for CC at best.
---
That is good, the content on twitch was slightly becoming stale outside of streamers challenging themselves with speedrunning or ironman mode.   
---
I am looking forward watching these people enjoy the unique time of experiencing the game at a locked level and the meta associated with it.
---
The Talent Calculator ability list shows abilities that never existed, even in Vanilla WoW, like Black Arrow for the hunter.
---
I semi agree with you about the lfg thing, however, custom groups and guild groups are still vastly superior for all content, lfg is for a ridiculously large group who, even when pushed to do group content, simply wouldn't for whatever reason. When it comes down to it, lfg should be a non-issue because at least those people who would go "lol terrible game" yet never would do a dungeon or anything would just kind of shove it.
---
I do think that WoW's lfg leaves a lot to be desired, and I'll never be able to put my finger on why, as I do like both FFXIV and ESO'S lfg (on that note, both those games also feel much more lively, as you never feel stuck sitting in town imo). 
---
I also see where you're coming from, but I also see why they have pruned those inconveniences, even if it's because they've added some semi-meaningless grinding
---
5x mage in stratholme is awesome for making gold at 60
---
If it only lasts for 3 weeks then sure I agree but if it lasts for months it'll be a huge problem.
---
What should come after Naxx is what was next before. This is not a problem for anyone if they do it in a manner that pleases everyone : splitting server for those that want BC and those that stays on classic. I don't even see why this poses a problem, the game cannot stay still forever, at least, not for everyone going into classic once again. Let people that want to go forward, and let people that don't don't. 
---
Many people that gonna start wow classic are coming also because the leveling experience in retail is a purge. Wow classic gonna solve it in a cool faschion.
---
It doesn't feel like WoW without full PvP to me.
---
Found the warrior :) Warriors will be dual wielding and won‚Äôt be capped in their off hand - they will be getting parried constantly. 
---
Druids will take a small hit to TPS from the new parry values that they‚Äôll compensate for by burning more MCP charges. Warriors don‚Äôt have that options.
---
Already removed the logo, right now I'm not really interested in editing it even further, but maybe I'll do it when I'm bored :D

If you want to go fast mage first solo is a good idea. I have a warrior/priest now but still in the starting zone.
---
Yeah oaky you are just mad to be mad and hating just to hate, no trace of reason left in you reasoning.
---
That's sad.
---
K now I'm annoyed. 
---
These beta testers will have a huge advantage when the game releases. 
---
They will know all the best quests, exactly what class they want, fastest leveling routes and not to mention tons of experience playing their class.
---
I wonder if hiding under the bridge spamming /golfclap will work as well as it did in Vanilla.
---
nInE pErCeNT!!!
---
Yeah, it's just the juxtaposition between defining efficiency as maximising fun/hour vs maximising xp or gold/hour. Many people focus on the latter at the detriment of the former! It's objectively good advice for maximising gold per hour of course! :)
---
Okay but when do we get invited to the Beta?
---
2H Fury &gt; 1H Fury? Is it only better with Windfury or is it better than 1H in general? Is there some kind of guide or dps test data I can check out that supports it? I want to be the best Warrior dps I can be in raids(if elected tank I'll do that too), and I'll read just about anything to get a better idea of my choices.
---
Most people think of leveling and questing as solo activities but I think it's more fun, faster, and less tedious to level with friends. It won't help you in the case of the level ?? gankers but it will help you in the case of lone rogues and hunters. Even another group of gankers will think twice before attacking because they will want to figure out how many of you there are first.
---
Once you have a reputation of being hard to gank it's going to go more smoothly. I mean not counting people getting on their alts or getting their guildmates to help gank you.
---
I'm not super experienced with wPvP leveling but I've been playing on a pserver recently and I'm level 27 warr now. Playing horde and the alliance on this server really likes to go wild sometimes. I've been leveling on and off with a friend who is also leveling a warrior. We got into some shit last night in wetlands (doing a class quest). Alliance kept coming by and ganking us. Close to us in level but often times they were already level 30. My friend is much better at PvP than me. After he killed a couple of them (with a tiny bit of help from me), they came back with a bigger group and killed us a few times then they left. We eventually finished the quest and hearth out of there.
---
So I would say, it did slow us down but it didn't stop us. We just had to be patient when we ressed. Being in a group helped. Winning some of the fights helped. Most people will leave after they've had a bit of fun or revenge. It's rude to corpse camp and most players won't do it.
---
Solo when I've been attacked by higher level characters and I'm just not in the mood I'll take my hands off the keyboard mouse and just stand there.  Most people don't feel good about killing you when you don't put up a fight so they leave afterwards. That's been my experience anyway.
---
I'm not much of an expert but these are just things I've noticed on my way to level 30. I hope that helps.
---
But it will though especially if they want to avoid ques which is the whole purpose of this layering stuff.
---
Really doubt warriors will be dual wielding and druids will spike more in damage than they do on pservers.
---
&gt;Yeah you don't need to be a dick and deliberately misinterpret what he's saying. 
---
He even admitted he was wrong but it seems to me you were looking for a reason to get triggered. Find someone else to get up in arms against, my time is too valueable to cater to you =)
---
Warriors can reduce incoming damage in a way that Druids cannot. Stop sperging so hard.
---
If you did the grind in TBC or later, it‚Äôs 10-20 times longer. You kill way faster, you agro more, runtime for turn-in is longer, you might not be able to do the fourth quest due to difficulty and you have competition from other players, unlike in other expansions.  I‚Äôm doing it but don‚Äôt expect it before mid-2020 at earliest.
---
Honestly wouldn't mind if they did a level lock from 30-40-50-60 each week for the first month. Obviously, i don't expect it at all, but it would be nice to experience this exclusive meta
---
It's 99% advertisement, 1% testing. If they really cared about finding all the bugs they'd invite more players. Even streamers and content creators have complained that there are too few people in the beta and they wish they'd let more people in.
---
Check my comment, the head post isn't mine, I've done my own edited version as mentioned in the title and included it in the comments. That version is spellchecked and uncluttered.
---
Wrong sub
---
My understanding of TF's proc is that you dont need to throttle after you get it
---
No.. a shit post would be layering just as it is but sharding would be a picture of a man in whitey titeys with a shit stain on them.
---
Hunter at 30 when they get feign death.
---
then why are fury tanks a thing?
---
I always wondered. Was it possible to get that green hood and the rest of the dwarf starting area armor? I always thought it was subtly badass.
---
It's tricky.. if you don't do random roll you may not get players.
---
Thank the gods for Bessie. And her tits!
---
What's it like being 12?
---
that would be so dumb
---
FOURTY HYPE BOYS

Problem is mythic in WoW requires bear perfect play and understanding of the fights. There isn‚Äôt a way of picking up large amounts of dead weight or slack. Classic raids can be done be anyone and are only really hindered by a loose gear check.
---
For people looking for efficient leveling, which dungeons are actually worth doing? 
---
My concern is that certain dungeons like SM aren't worth the effort due to travel time, time wasted finding groups, and of course the potential for group breakdown for one reason or another.
---
As a priest I plan on doing BFD for the quest reward wand, probably Stockades and ZF since they're convenient and then obviously all the "high end" dungeons for pre-raid gear and attunement quests.
---
Do we know that world buffs stacking is not going to be in Classic or just that it was not in vanilla?
---
Ive seen a few mythic pugs that kill 1-3 bosses
---
This is really in depth, thanks.  
---
I never questioned that the Ash was the best, but it helps put in perspective how much better.
---
I'm under the impression that Ash would be somewhat stronger but not overpoweringly so compare to Huhu stinger.  (In the absence of a proc) Is that not the case?  
---
Also, another question:  doesn't a 15% quiver mean you will always clip Ann auto with aimed shot if you're using Ash?  If that's the case wouldn't it be better to use a 10% quiver to leave you never clipping your autos?  
---
Finally, what about nerubian Slavemaker?  I guess not that it matters since it's a KT weapon, but don't you clip the auto with any quiver?  Isn't it worth it to not use a quiver then to make sure you get all 3 autos in every 9 second window? (Potentially even going 0/21/30 to avoid improved hawk?)
---
Oh please, not everyone is going to want to server transfer.
---
Who the hell chose 30 in the first place? 
---
This is awesome.
---
All this already can be found out on private servers
---
So will everyone who played the game back in 04-06. All of those resources are available just by reading online guides right now....
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is classic raiding isn‚Äôt hardcore...
---
I was in a guild on a private server named Spirit of the Forest. We were a night elf only guild. We would raid stv with 20+ people all stealthed in shadowmeld ready to ambush the horde. We were all able to communicate in Darnasssian. It was a great time.
---
Beyond the point of every Beta tester has always had that advantage this is a game with 15 years worth of documentation. Even if you never played Vanilla you can find the best quests, fastest leveling routes, and really should be able to determine your class. 
---
This sounds more like whaah I didn't get a Beta....
---
There will undoubtedly be more layers (servers), than there was at launch in 2004.  If they weren't anticipating so many people playing, they wouldn't have developed layering in the first place.
---
Kinda surprised this is coming so soon. 
---
also bummed they aren't inviting more people.
---
Thank you! Great work. Just double checking--can i save and print these?
---
2025 (August)
---
I'm excited for the folks that want to hit the level cap in beta. Lots of fun shenanigans will be had. 
---
Me though? I don't plan on leveling past 15 or 20. I want as much of Classic to feel fresh as possible at release. Might level each class to there to get a feel for them and then choose a main.
---
The real treasure was the fun and friends we made along the way
---
^^^also ^^^soon‚Ñ¢
---
LET ME IN
---
LET ME INNNNNNNNNNN
---
Congrats on the YouTube views!
---
The quests in the area even refers to the buildings as "hovels"
---
Not trying to tell you how to game, mate, but don't let it bother you. Really think hard about why you're playing. Is it really better to "know the best quests" and how to level the fastest? That just doesn't seem fun. Who are you racing? Are you in a top 5 guild that needs to get to 60 asap?
---
I think it's objectively better to not get burnt out on the game now and instead to save it all for official release. And if you really want to test out a vanilla class there are... side servers for that.
---
This but unironically. 
---
I'm watching it now! I love these classic wow streams. Even some of WoW devs have been going live and explaining history of the game.
---
Irrelevant - neither tank has difficulty surviving in 1.12 content. Keep trying.
---
STVietnam
---
Don‚Äôt doubt it. Not saying it can‚Äôt be pugged but it‚Äôs not something you see. During vanilla and even on pservers you see trade filled with PuGs for raids from MC-&gt; AQ40. On retail you see people selling mythic carries.
---
lol I'm sure it is
---
Yeah, sure why not :D
---
You know there's a huge difference in actually game time experience and watching a video online right? 
---
Oh and playing a game 15 years ago you forget a lot. 
---
I leveled back in vanilla and I forgot a lot.
---
Another typo: Hearthglen only has one N.
---
Can You give us any proof perhaps?
---
Only thing mandatory for me is a Lazypig addon that lets you sell junk items at vendors and autocomplete quest dialogue by holding shift.
---
Reading your response for Tribunus\_Plebis i still say that, the way you want to count the skinning gold per hour is still bogus. Because you arn't spending a "3.4 hour" consecutive period of time skinning while leveling. You do other stuff inbetween skinning. Making this 3.4 hour period into more like 110-700+ hours. 
---
Given you are as efficent as someone 14 years ago([Joana](https://youtu.be/TW9wP0J--BM?list=PL49Ga_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n&amp;t=4985)) you ding 1-60 in 4 days 20 hours. Ignoring the fact that Joana didn't skin anything nor had any other producing/gathering proffesions. You clock in at around 116 hours, Given the amount you provided, that would gold per hour would be more along the lines of. 1,2495 gold per hour.
---
And also, realy... are you that anal retentive that you get hung up that i wrote a number rounded up to a whole number instead of writing a copper amount and an atleast 28 long decimal number?
---
Great TPS of course
---
subtle brag
---
Yeah they changed from Defensive to Assist.
---
I‚Äôm asking if other people have it, don‚Äôt wanna get hopes up
---
but you wont lose threat with TF
---
Hunters actually put out crazy dps of they have the right gear and Lupos, even early game
---
This kinda reminded me from the skeleton from Tales from the Crypt! üòÇ
---
But have you seen a female orc from behind?
---
Ya I was :(
---
Heck yeah dude, Shadowmeld is sick in WPvP...
---
It wont be dead lol. Servers need like 2k people to function well
---
Yes that‚Äôs the difference in parry rate.
---
try logging in?
---
I was wondering the same thing. There's a ton of [removed] in this thread.
---
&gt; fucking yes
---
Wow, crazy what it took to get a simple answer, to a simple question, from someone who I thought was trying to be helpful.
---
&gt; you have GOOGLE.com
---
No, what is that? Can you please provide me a link?
---
you'd have to be a damned fool to expect that lmao (so... a lot of people will. point taken.)
---
Gods I was strong back then!
---
I don't know. What do you think?
---
A big part of the issue with LFG is the cross-realm nature of it. When you're playing with such a massive pool of people, there's no need to be polite or courteous because you'll probably never see this group again. If it was only grouping you with people on your server, you'd keep playing with the same people and want to be on good terms with them
---
I disagree. Keeping the beta to this exclusive crowd of streamers and near-day-one vanilla accounts ensures higher quality bug reports, less noise, etc.
---
Of course it exists, virtually horde are going to be running around with Paladin buffs in Classic.
---
Can confirm stonetalon lol leveling my 21 rogue there a fucking army of 19 twinks (maybe 10 of em) all were wrecking havoc last night... It was actually pretty funny being all pink hairs gnomes attacking us with such fury. 
---
Earlier yesterday morning I had a player on a ne hunter Shadow meld at the enterance and his stealth cat pet was planted mid walk way. Slaughtering everyone. 
---
I counted 14 none rez'd horde corpses just within maybe 100 ft of the enterance. 
---
Night before last I was trying to finish the escort quest and was being camped by a different ne hunter that would just also send her pet to do the dirty work. 
---
Honestly though I'm not complaining its so fun and makes the world feel actually dangerous. Plus I just want to kill alliance even more now so it actually makes me want to play more.
---
NO CHANGES !!!!
---
Krisko23, Gods what a stupid name.
---
Well, that post only confirms eliminating 1% penalty for 305+ skill. Its like a bonus 1%. I havent found a source from blizzard, that would say that every +1 skill adds 0,2% hit rating tho and I would like to see that as well
---
&gt;What I think is good about these ideas is that its not just pure speculation. They've been implemented, and they WORK
---
&gt; What I think is good about these ideas is that its not just pure speculation. They've been implemented, and they WORK 
---
Yep, except it's WoW, not Everquest.
---
No faulty logic here, you are just entirely confused about what I am saying because you are upset I don't invite ret paladins. If people can make an optimal dungeon run like you listed, yes, they absolutely would. Was I supposed to disagree with that or think it's bad? Making a dungeon is about compromise though and you can either wait 4 hours to get that group that does 100% damage, or you can build a group that does 90% damage in 45mins. Yes, you might could build it in 30mins by accepting a ret pally, but then you are doing 70% damage instead and the extra time it takes to clear the dungeon wasn't worth the 15 minutes you shaved off of the forming time sometimes. Especially if the group isn't super stable to begin with and it ends up causing wipes because battles take a little too long.
---
I'm going to stop you before you try to argue the damage numbers here with me, those were arbitrary numbers and entirely irrelevant to my point. Ret Paladins do less damage in general and that is all there is to it, it's been proven in-game with parses. It's not about whether you think it's a little or a lot or how much at all, people don't want them and they won't invite them if they can avoid it. It's fine if you feel differently, but your feelings don't mean anything in the game. All anyone is trying to explain is WHY people aren't inviting paladins, if you don't like it, blame Blizzard. No one is shitting on Paladins or telling you not to invite them, just that they aren't optimal, plain and simple. I'm sure you love them, and it sucks for you, but them's the breaks.
---
You guys are getting super salty and emotional over this shit. It's fine you want to take ret pallies. No one is telling you not to do that. We are saying that we just don't want to because ret pally is at the bottom of the dps by a fairly big margin and no amount of downvotes and mental gymnastics is going to change that. We wish it wasn't true as much as you guys. Ret pally is FUN, it's just not GOOD. We would love an entire extra class to pick from for dps and tanks, ESPECIALLY tanks, and in dungeons, prot is a little more loved than ret to be fair, but the game is designed the way it's designed. You're mad at the wrong people here, but keep downvoting me out of anger instead of asking Blizzard to do a balance pass.
---
I can sorta agree with removing the respec cost however it does test the economy in a certain way
---
&gt;  All the minmaxing for nothing lol.
---
This a stupid mindset that could apply to the whole beta. Mix/Max your char is not only fun in meta's that never existed before but also represents a a great testing experience.
---
There are 20 other replies to my first comment explaining it. Why do you need your fucking hand held. Dont answer that. Just think.
---
Ah. Whoops. Sorry about that :)
---
anyone get an update popup for beta test?  
---
and then check your client and you absolutely are not in  
---
cause I'm kind of triggered
---
Hello all,
---
Casual player here looking for a guild that isn‚Äôt too serious, but one where I can learn and grow as a WoW player. I have been playing WoW on and off since BC. I am more than excited to experience the vanilla gameplay. I will definitely be maining classic. 
---
Some important factors that may sway you or keep you scrolling:
---
-Alliance faction
---
-Central Time Zone
---
-Flexible schedule between 6pm-12am cst (I work 8am-5pm) during the week.
---
-Most weekends I will be free all day 
---
-I have experience with every class to date. Willing to play a class that fits the needs of the guild (however, i am slightly poor at tanking). I do enjoy melee, but have leveled casters and it can be fun.
---
-I am completely new to raiding. This is why I wouldn‚Äôt want to be tossed into a serious environment. Although, if you are willing to teach me and are patient...I will give you my all. 
---
-I am not easily distracted by IRL things. I have gf that knows I‚Äôm a huge nerd. Of course, i do have to from time to time, keep the lady happy by going out and doing stuff. 
---
-Friendly and easy to gel with. 
---
-Not interested in an immature/petty environment. I get enough of that IRL, don‚Äôt need it in WoW. 
---
Please reach out to me on discord if you are interested in such a member.
---
MutatedKG#1319
---
I meant frost.  Sometimes melee needs fire resist early on in MC progression.  Depends on your raid team and strats.
---
Blessed Qiraji War Hammer
---
Can‚Äôt open the program , just in my recently added
---
~23-38 is millennials, the grouping kinda of makes sense with that in mind
---
Very minimal from what i read in this sub so far
---
I hear the choppers coming...
---
Damn nice!
---
Ugh the flashbacks this picture conjures...
---
#NOCHANGES

'Strangle\*horn\* vale'
---
Considering that druids can get the armor cap in pre-bis and have higher HP than a warrior, even several crits are not enough to kill them. The mythical string of perfect crits to kill you as fast as possible is like having DFT drop 5 weeks in a row in BWL. You have to assume extremely shitty healers to think that an extra 9% parry chance will make the difference between feral tanks being very competitive and unviable.
---
" We raided MC for a few weeks, I got my epic hunter pants. We killed Onyxia and Hakkar, we almost got to Ragnaros but then TBC was released and it was back to leveling again. "
---
This time, you'll get to do and enjoy the rest of it &lt;3 :)
---
beta is down today, idk why you think you didnt get it if its there
---
For sure...but whatever "advantage" this gives testers is really negligent after like 2 weeks from release. The value in comprehensive beta testing is well worth and perceived disadvantage it puts some players at
---
How can we kill that which has no life?
---
Hey yeah that‚Äôs a great idea!  Maybe we could also implement time gated content. You know - maybe only half the zones are unlocked for the first couple months. Maybe also time gate some of the quests!  You know, like maybe only 4 out of the 8 boat meat can drop each week!  
---
Or maybe all these ideas are as fucking dumb as yours.
---
I took 3 day vacation for ‚Äúfamily reunion‚Äù lol
---
Ahhh the good ole navy seals copypasta. I haven‚Äôt seen it in a while.
---
It didn't have bugs. Spell batching had bugs. The glitching through the walls and climbing up things are not bugs. They were there before. If you want to remove them sure go ahead but you don't need a beta to know that they would be there.
---
Priests and druids get spirit and mp5. Shamans and paladins only have mp5.
---
When the talents talk about mana regen they are talking about spirit. Mp5 is separate and I don't believe is effected by modifiers.
---
Nah, I like mine.
---
Hopefully we can get a nice sample size to really get some insight into what things might look like!
---
What about for the droves of crap artists that modern blizzard had to hire and find some makework for?
---
TBC and Wrath was like death by a thousand cuts, no one really noticed it until CATA or Mists just how much the game changed by that point.
---
&lt;- mabdall
---
I might throw up some comparisons to the same data from the original game...
---
I'm no expert but I think most people would get disembowled trying to take on a boar the same size as them with nothing but a dagger.
---
It indirectly has to do with world of warcraft because tips is streaming world of warcraft, and viewers obviously care whether or not the person they are watching and donating to is doing something criminal or not. I dont know how that's hard for a normal functioning human being to comprehend.
---
This would make sense. I told my wife that once they bump level cap to 40 they will invite more people to Beta. This allows the new crop to test hopefully corrected bugs reported by the first round. I figure this progression will continue every cap jump.
---
Now just waiting for work to end so I can check if I got in this round.
---
If only I was in the beta :(
---
imagine thinking your opinion of fun is objective truth
---
Agreed! The people who grew up with the game.
---
I just don‚Äôt wanna be jebaited like when they added Beta AND stress test tab, I am still not believing I got it
---
Blizzard flagged this as a Hunter spell and it also caused some confusion in vanilla (see old comments: https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3674/black-arrow#comments)
---
We have a way to override how Blizzard categorizes spells so we'll flag this in the future so it won't appear on the calc.
---
The beta is super small. Like 1500 people or something, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about people having an advantage over you. A lot of these people played vanilla anyway. Its still capped so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôll be anything like how it will be at launch. They‚Äôre currently playing a level 30 meta which won‚Äôt exist (other than twinks) when classic releases. 
---
If you have basic WoW knowledge like not standing in the fire, keeping yourself repaired, etc., then you should be fine. There will be millions of noobs. 
---
It won‚Äôt be easy for anyone. You‚Äôll just have to figure it out in your own or make some in-game friends. Being polite to others will get you far :)
---
im assuming 9% more parry makes it just 9% harder at best.
---
so if a druid tank died 10% of the time ona  pserver, its gonna be 19%
---
For the horde!!!  For sure my man.  Great choice.
---
I need targets for my dwarf hunter.
---
it has to be enemy cast bars and dialogkey.  you can see enemies casting spells and what the spell is.  you can use your number keys and space bar to navigate NPC dialog and accept quests.
---
I thought they were doing that enough by the services they claim are expensive so people won't buy them.
---
A service a business is selling but does not want you to buy...
---
is this really a concern, assuming you aren't also using your old hardware from 2004? lol
---
Your notion of the dps classes is not right. Rogues are literally amongst the top aoe class if they are pve spec‚Äôd. They also offer sap and blind, which is pretty important in 5man dungeons.
---
You can argues rets can offheal, which is nice, but they def usually are not top dps at all.
---
Any idea who the two in the middle are? Been bothering me that I don't know.
---
[The first part of this video](https://youtu.be/YbpEZLT8Wsc) is about the Frostsaber grind and gives maps and math. Madseason makes some great content.
---
Minmaxing is always a thing though in any mmo. We‚Äôll all reach 60 work on pre raid BiS then onto MC and rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs actually one of things I enjoy most about wow as you can constantly work on making your character just a tiny bit better
---
It's good that they're upping the cap and offering the chance for more things to be tested. It's not even just about checking if everything works, but rather, if everything looks and feels just like it did way back.
---
Unfortunately I was expecting a lot more people to be invited. I really wanted to try it out, too. 19 days left on my token, here's to hoping I get in!
---
Big brain
---
Beta isnt down I am watching Kargoz playing on it.
---
Right because all those streamers are testing tons and not just running high level dungeons and trying to get BiS level 30 for duel tournaments. That's not to say they don't find bugs incidentally, but come on. Not to mention how they conveniently raise the level cap when hype is starting to die down for the level 30 content. Call me cynical, but I can't help roll my eyes.
---
I'm really not that interested in beta myself, I'd only play a little bit if at all. I scratched my itch in the stress test and don't want to burn out before the actual launch.
---
Day 1 hour 1, can you repeat that a few more times?
---
This is accurate.  Daggers is on par with swords from Felstriker (prepaid) onward.  Sword most likely edges it out very slightly, but it‚Äôs not really noticeable.  The kicker is that swords are a lot easier to gear for... preraid most notably.
---
This is true, it will suck trying to get the initial levels so you don't fall behind the leveling curve, but if you are serious about leveling it then stick at it and even hang around a zone for a little while after you have finished the quests to catch up on the gathering proff.
---
Another thing I do early on in the expansion is to level tailoring and send every green item I make to a bank alt and have him DE it. Enchanting mats go for a pretty penny early on. This can remove you form the rat race for herbs and mines.
---
You can then drop tailoring and skinning at 60 and go pick up herb/alch and level it in your own time.
---
oh...
---
600iq vanilla 5head to the max
---
I know what I‚Äôm talking about, but you don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt even believe you played vanilla because if you did you‚Äôd know that Druids were trash
---
They put you in a queue for a group, but all players would have to run to the stone to get in the queue and it paid no attention to group comp. You would end up with 3 mages a rogue and a feral druid or something if you even ever got a group. Most people just asked in the major cities to create groups for runs or did /who warrior 60 and whispered people if all they needed was one specific class.
---
With that logic you can't roll Rogue or Warrior either since the other half of the Horde are Orc players with 25% stun resist. 
---
You have Paladins on your faction. You will be more than fine in group PVP.
---
Sure if you don't care about getting a head of the zerg on day #1.
---
Im so happy cap is going up. So many of us have our mount money already because at level 30 cap the quests started giving gold, kek.
---
Cant wait to see how packed the zones are. Especially this weekend. More talents to test, and huge reduction on respecs... Just patch it in now!!!!!!gogogogogogo
---
Stress Test is not until a while so you may of likely got in.
---
have htey confirmed cap increase?
---
Thats the thing they call it being racist. I dont mind at all if they actually respect western values but example 50% of muslims in brits support Sharia. 
---
Then there are crime statistics and free benefits. Imagine rapers in our country get max 2 years prison. 1 year with good behaviour.
---
That's not how it works but ok
---
2/10 bait
---
&gt;Blizzard needs to realize
---
You are asking for too much.
---
I can confirm... that I still got no beta.
---
The superior BG.
---
yes you can.
---
Maybe they do a Wave today who knew. Yesterday was Just a very small F&amp;F
---
Here's hoping they open up some more invite waves soon after.
---
It makes Edgmaster's Handguards twice as good.
---
burn out is for the weak
---
ive already burned warcraft into my being, my soul
---
They are testing if grinding gold works.
---
Warlocks are going to be terrifying.
---
You want the shaman big dog. Healing, casting lightning, and wind fury crits. They can do anything if talented for it including tanking dungeons
---
Druids:
---
* Don't block or parry so more damage is taken by default
---
* Can‚Äôt push crushes off the hit table and generally has low amounts of defense so can be crit (this is offset by more armor mitigation making it less potent)
---
* Can‚Äôt drink potions or eat healthstones while in form
---
* Can‚Äôt drink rage pots for extra initial rage (though this has not seemed to affect me negatively ever)
---
* Can‚Äôt stance dance for fear mechanics (less of an issue for Alliance druids)
---
* Not able to talent to get 2 seconds shorter cooldown for Taunt
---
* No secondary taunt ability (Mocking Blow)
---
* Not able to disarm
---
* Less frequent silence if mob is immune to stun
---
* Can never provide the Thunderfury debuff 
---
So really it depends which content you're talking about. 
---
In early 60  small group dungeons druids are strictly better. 
---
As your progress into harder raids and your guild is pushing its limits then Warriors ability to mitigate incoming damage is so important. Even when you're geared enough to fury tank, the warrior is still switching stances and  periodically equipping shields to use the mitigation abilities that druids don't have. 
---
But you're the one flailing around and sperging all over this thread taunting people. Who do we really think is butthurt?
---
I'm skeptical this actually happens on mega servers that'll inevitably pop up. Could see Blizzard saying something like this "due to the overload on certain realms, we've decided to keep layering for the foreseeable future"

It's just a confusing glitch because the grenades don't explode on miss like they're supposed to.
---
I think these anecdote stories are my favorite part of the intensifying hype. Thank you for sharing!
---
&gt; Just think.
---
Hmmmm, does a @mouseover macro cast the target on my current target, or the target I'm mousing over?
---
&gt; fucking yes, what would be the point if not
---
Hmmm, idk, maybe to CC the target i'm mousing over?  Wait. Don't answer that. Just think.
---
Beta isn#t vanilla its classic. Basically vanilla with a few nuts.
---
when?
---
I spent 100 karma doing this. Its not everyday you can make threads like this.
---
People in reddit can be butthurt but that doesnt change my mind that I refuse to group up with hunters. Im sure tanks in my friendlist dont mind it eather considered they dont have to roll for melee weapons with hunters.
---
Nice thanks

search for your question, if there are two pages of results, then your question was frequently asked.  if there are two results, then your question was asked infrequently.  if there are no comments in the threads, then your question has yet to be answered, or you used the wrong key words and can try again.
---
But eventually you'll be at 60 and that's where you'll spend the most time.........

Not my work, check my comment.

Literally the only reason i know about this is because Asmon talked for 10+ minutes about how he didnt want to talk about it.

I like it! The biggest issue with the remodeling was that they didn't even try to stay true to the old models.

Time to link this every time
---
In what world did wsg not have bugs wtf
---
The best possible way for beta participants to assist development is by playing. They have probably cleared the majority of their backlog of bugs discovered from 1-30, and are looking to expand their testing to 31-40 content. I would expect them to increase the cap again in the future to 50. 
---
The question of whether they will go all the way to 60 is an interesting one, and I‚Äôm not sure here. I think it would be in the best interest of the game to allow for testing of at least the quest zones. However, if they allow players to test endgame content, time would be too much of a constraint, as we would see players maxing just a few weeks before launch. 
---
This brings up yet another reason why blizzard‚Äôs selection of beta participants is smart: these streamers will play all day every day, thus allowing more content to be beta tested within such a limited time. The only chance this beta has of seeing level 60 content is if the participants are grinding full time, such as what these streamers are doing!
---
The denial of your salt level is hilarious. If you were thinking about this issue objectively, you would come to the same conclusions.
---
minxmaxing will happen at 40?
---
Well most fury tanks don't have Thunderfury lol
---
Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen it on private servers where nolifers play 48 hours straight to get to the first aoe camp which is gnolls in wetlands I believe for alliance. At that point they don‚Äôt have much competition for the spot and they kind of just take off from there. Other classes aren‚Äôt really interested in these spots so there isn‚Äôt much competition and there are a variety of spots for each level range.
---
I hope they put in AV soon so people can confirm the inevitable zerging and we can start to properly petition for old AV.
---
I think we are mostly on the same page. I do think some of them need to be culled like limitations on stacking items. but even that can cause interactions like - if you have more bag space taken up you need to go back to town more often and that process can lead to interactions that you would normally not even have. 
---
How do you account for that?
---
Pets are incredible utility. Knowing how to macro pets, which pet to use, and pet micromanagement is one of the things which really make the better warlocks stand out. Beyond raw damage, pets expand your utility by a wide margin.

Holy nova is aaaawesome to boost ppl through dungeons with btw :D Kill mobs + heal your weak lowbie friends :D
---
Hmmm so would you lean orc or undead knowing all this? 
---
Lock is the one class I feel like I had the least experience with back then
---
Yeah once you're max level at least at 30 there's not much to do but SMGY, RFK, and Gnomer farm runs. The other thing to do is pvp. Pretty obvious conclusion there.
---
Isn't coil lvl 42?
---
Yes but they are trying for a faithful recreation right? Would it be faithful to add a bunch of weapons that add to feral weapon skills?
---
Why dont you open your fucking eyes and read the comments right next to yours, or better yet, actually use the internet instead of relying on redditors to answer your questions KID.

Some of the best casting animations in the game.....

Amount of salt and talking about streamers under that post is sad.
---
This man knows what‚Äôs up. We used to shout CRUSADER over vent every proc. Good times.
---
your right I forgot that the weapon damage itself was not normalized
---
Were Warriors really top dps at 60 in Vanilla? I really can't remember.
---
There is nothing wrong with the old models, they are timeless.
---
Interested to see the end results because no way Druid is more popular than Mage. Also hope the Ally/Horde ratio evens out
---
Rogue dual wield at level 10 as well.
---
Bonus gold was a good thing too
---
Question: Aren't Ice Shards and Piercing Ice bad talents to skip? They seem to increase damage quite a bit
---
Yes you can but if you have a class the other races dont have keep your hearth for UC so you can go back and get your first class quest
---
This sounds pretty great.  I'll be new to vanilla (havent actively played since late tbc/wotlk) and never really had the time to raid back then with school and now have work/wife/kids so this sort of schedule may be ideal.  You list a raid start time but not how long you plan to go for.  Any thoughts on that?  It's a great start time for me (830 central) but since it's so early your time and only one day, I'm guessing you may plan to raid for a longer stretch.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but how can you have a twink without grinding? twinks are by definition boosted characters.  Dedicated twinkers double boxed to grind instances for rare/epic drops. Yeah you can have a ‚Äútwink‚Äù before your main hits 60 or without farming instances, but at that point it‚Äôs just low lvl pvp.
---
100% this.   Holy nova is NOT powerful enough to kill 4-5 mobs of the same level as you.
---
Im pretty sure i can guess where you're playing lol and I agree it's hilarious. Like that time i was just minding my own business in the charred vale at around level 30, then 2 level 19's jump me and the lads are so twinked-out they made me eat my own shit and say thanks. Made me laugh out loud.
---
Darude, Sandstorm.  Somebody in guild vent would play it before raid bosses throughout Wrath.  Always brings me back to a very happy time in my life.
---
Stratholme and Scholomance. They were my favourite instances because I started with Warcraft 3, and I've been feeling down ever since they... *changed* them.
---
Same here, originally 2005 and have been active for at least part of all expansions.  No luck on beta yet, only stress test if that helps your decision.
---
Not arbitrarily time gated...
---
The difference being - server effort could change the time. Significantly different.
---
9% more parry doesn't mean 9% more deaths...it doesn't even mean the boss does 9% more damage. It just means that an extra 9% of the time, the boss's swing timer will be reduced by 40%.
---
Only gnomes and tauren are allowed to be made the first two weeks, then dwarf and troll unlock.  Two weeks later night elf and orc.  Then finally 6 weeks into classic, undead and human unlock and receive temporary heirlooms until level 30 as a catchup mechanic!
---
The 40 duel tournament is gonna be very interesting because now everyone will have most of their main abilities.
---
Soul link is 40
---
They've already said they've hit the right amount of players for testing and have toned down invites considerably.
---
&gt; only Tank,
---
Only Main Tank\*\*
---
!RemindMe 6 hours
---
The problem is they haven't given a hard timeline for when it will end. Blizzard is extremely wishy-washy when it comes to stuff like this so you can see why people are worried.
---
The only gear you will really be sharing is the weapon, which is not a big deal. For the first 30+ levels you will pretty much be using vendor weapons and quest reward staves. Elemental has major mana problems. Water is REALLY expensive.
---
Orcs are actually pretty good! Trolls are neutral, Tauren are neutral, but Forsaken make up for that by being a bony void of assless despair.
---
Contrast that to: Humans - pretty good! Dwarf, Gnome - they have some roundness going on. NE female - not terrible.  NE male - we don't talk about those, they barely have hips, thighs aren't supposed to work like that, what is even happening here
---
Ayyy a fellow Gorefiend player. Though I was on Alliance and extremely casual back then.
---
They‚Äôre ok. Definitely counter some stuff with bubble and such and can defend points. Also can occasionally one shot people with a gimmick spec in which you stack a buff. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs fixed though
---
Yea bro, I‚Äôm 38 and in the same situation. I relate to this very much. Thanks for sharing. Can‚Äôt wait.
---
I have been watching as people have been voting, its interesting to see how things swing as time passes. That's why a big sample size is usually imperative...
---
by a mile and the more gear they got the bigger the gap became. Raids had like 10 warriors and only 1-3 were tanks. And even tanks were furry speced since thread was a MUCH bigger issue than survivability.
---
They can actually tank undead dungeons pretty well
---
WELL MAYBE MR T HACKED THE GAME AND CREATED A MOHAWK CLASS. HAS THIS EVER OCCURRED TO YOU, MR CONDESCENDING DIRECTOR?
---
Allright, level 40 is a whole different world. Level 30 was cool, but I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy that meta. However 40? Now I'm actually jealous of people having beta. So much stuff to test.
---
And birds are singing... If you smell coffee it's too much.

#nochanges

Wrath was when the game ended for me. Like many TBC players and vanilla players going to TBC before that I was on burnout. PvP gear I spent hours grinding to even be remotely competitive in arenas was useless, my arena gear was useless, and what little raid gear I had was like 2 tiers behind. My lock made it to 80? or 75? w/e the cap was. The most fun was my druid because feral was doing insane damage during leveling so I could finally gank on a druid. 
---
I played the new battlegrounds. Tried a few instances. Even started arena again. But my heart wasn't in it. Learning how my character was supposed to work all over again (both of them). Figuring out new gear. Also I got incarcerated, but I think I would have quit anyways lol
---
My druid is from vanilla and my Warlock I unfortunately started after resil impacted DoTs (it didnt impact white damage what a stupid design descision, bring a priest if u dont like DoT's) and it became World of Meleecraft. Rogues could become immune to spells and teleport around with shadowstep. Warriors could charge in combat. reflect spells and generally were as indestructible as they were wrecking balls silicing through my 15k Hp Warlock with Soul link :p. Thats part of why I am excited for classic. Maybe I can play destro or elemental shaman or a mage that crits even when shatter ISNT up. Although maybe I'll just follow my instinct and never play a caster in WoW again. 
---
At any rate I understand how you feel. I am curious to try the new system for class spec. It seems like they got a defined identity for each and some of the animations and stuff look cool as shit. But the game around it, as people liek you describe it, feels empty of character. Who cares about balance if it ruins the flavor and character of the game? the stuff that keeps you coming back.
---
Thanks for the comment! I actually played against Menismyforte in TBC. 
---
The 2nd clip is a case of player we know who is lagging because of a delayed shadowstep animation which you somehow failed to include.....(shaowstep also gave 70% movement in 2.3) which gives us a combination of lag + desync not uncommon in 2008. 
---
How do I know this? Because I researched clip and saw that you actually CUT OUT that part right before this clips starts where this rogue's delayed shadowstep animation (the dusty magic animation) goes off a whole second after his body actually teleports...which shows his latency and connection to the server is awful. (The longer time it takes to teleport the more lag a player has. I played a rogue/warrior TBC).
---
Which then makes sense when you see him swinging from so far away. This helps us SEE the desync and lag, but you would NOT know this from this clip... 
---
Look at this to see (Neilyo even refers to this Quote on SK Gaming to confirm)[https://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15313-Rogues_HARP_Spec_Nerfed__New_232_Patch_Notes] "The shadowstep buff is good so that a shadowstep isnt fully wasted on moving targets or ones with lag causing their movement to be delayed. "
---
Remember; you can find examples to show lag or desync or weird things; but not the mechanic of actual melee leeway in vanila-wotlk. Many instances of this lag and desync happened throughout the 15+Years but you will not find these exceptions of lag to prove the rule. Everyone has had hundreds of /played running away from players and knows intuitively the melee distance from playing the game and from the all videos in existence.
---
At first I was happy that you posted this, then after doing the research to see that you clearly start the clip immediately after the delayed shadowstep animation which is a dead give away to shows that the player is lagging....
---
**I can't help be saddened...Stop trying to confuse people....**
---
You always get all 3 autos in ever 9 second window, the question is whether or not to wait 0.18 seconds for the 4TH auto shot on a 10% quiver:
---
With 15% Quiver (2.89 seconds):
---
    0: Auto Shot + Aimed Shot cast
---
    2.89: Auto Shot gets clipped
---
    3: Aimed Shot + Multi Shot
---
    5.78: Auto Shot
---
    8.67: Auto Shot
---
With 10% Quiver (3.06 seconds):
---
    3.06: Auto Shot
---
    6.12: Auto Shot
---
    9.18: Auto Shot?
---
With 15% Quiver and Improved Hawk proc (2.023 seconds)
---
    2.023: Auto Shot gets clipped
---
    4.046: Auto Shot
---
    6.069: Auto Shot
---
    8.092: Auto Shot
---
    9: Aimed Shot cast
---
    11.023: Auto Shot gets clipped
---
    12: Aimed Shot + Multi Shot + Hawk wears off
---
    ~13.49: Auto Shot (this is a little wonky because you got a partial Hawk on the timer)
---
    16.38: Auto Shot
---
    18: Aimed Shot cast
---
    19.27: Auto Shot gets clipped
---
    21: Aimed Shot + Multi SHot
---
    22.16: Auto Shot
---
    25.05: Auto Shot
---
    27.94: Auto Shot?
---
So I think you always want to take the quiver and improved Hawk because of the extra Auto Shots. I can do the 10% Quiver and Slavemaker later, but I have a Destiny 2 raid to prepare for!
---
Man a lot of people really have hazy memories when it comes to classic.
---
The class hierarchy was real. Just like since achievemnts were first introduced and people demanded you link it before getting invited into the group/raid, sowere certain classes in classic expected to perform certain roles or get laughed out of their groups/guilds.
---
Why do you think Blizzard tried so hard to push "bring the player not the class? There were no shadow priests or elemental shamans. At least not in any progressing guild or the ones aiaming to axtualy clear MC and BWL at the start.
---
lol @ ret paladins outDPSing any rogue spec in an aoe heavy fight. There were no aoe heavy fights in vanilla except for mostly trash packs in raids. When such damage was required only mages and warlocks were used with hunters as support and whichever class had something little to throw in there.
---
Rogues were also one of the top dps classes in vanilla specificaly because there was so much single target dps.
---
Yeah... going to pay for that. I am broke. Been gearing and leveling alts professions. I‚Äôve got like 4 gold to my name right now. Got some saving to do before 40.
---
and then there will be another giant pvp tourny after everyone gets lvl 40 bis gear :D
---
Could potentially be July of 2025 as well.
---
As much as I'm having FOMO, I really think it's better this way. I'm a white-lightning gamer. I go all the fuck in when I find something I like to play and I reeeaaally want to save all of this pent up energy for the official release.
---
Blizzard is saving me from myself.
---
Typically, low level dungeons yield less exp per hour than questing does. I like to do the dungeons though, breaking the monotony of questing is well worth it in my opinion
---
RIP Alliance dueling tournament
---
Yikes, just another shit post loser that think Blizzard should be the end all be all in every dispute.
---
That‚Äôs for transcribing Skarm‚Äôs Man vs Bear series bro, I appreciate it.  Gonna keep this short :)
---
Bears put out higher TPS than warriors, except DW tanks with TF. 
---
All the survivability/edge case bullshit you mentioned doesn‚Äôt matter because you can do almost all the encounters without it. Tank survival is trivial, and Druids are tougher/equal to DWing warriors. All current data suggests damage values will be even lower on Classic. 
---
Feral tanks are a very close second to warriors as tanks, and probably equal/better when the guild has no TF. I will continue aggressively countering the constant bullshit I see on here about Druids from people clueless about the 1.12 meta. Literally got told an hour ago on here in an upvoted post that Druids can‚Äôt tank 5 mans. 
---
Thanks for playing.
---
Wow you're so big brain, dude. Ya got me. I'm just salty as fuck I'm not in beta and it definitely makes a ton of sense that there are like ~1500 people testing the game. I bet they definitely would find LESS bugs if they invited MORE people. Too bad I can't think objectively.
---
Fuck off.
---
why are they testing BG's so early if BG's wont be released with launch?
---
Problem was mainly that there are 4-5 good options and the rest was ugly or highly dependent on other settings. So if people just press RANDOM they get the trollfaces.
---
Private server info so take it with a grain of salt: the rogue popularity is massively overhyped, yes, there are more rogues in lower levels definitely, but the ones getting to 60 and gearing enough to be raid worthy are far and free between. We were consistently running 4-5 rogues per raid with noone to bench as there were no subs at all. Meanwhile we had like gazillion warlocks and mages. Of course classic mileage may vary but I don't think it will be the levels of roguecraft.
---
As long as I can use the old models I'm fine with having stuff like that as an option.
---
It's easy as long as the classes (or same class) synergize.
---
To further this - Warrior really sucks early on. You will start to feel a LITTLE bit better at level 36 when unlock whirlwind. The instant attack makes a massive difference. 
---
Then when you switch over to arms at 40 for mortal strike you‚Äôll feel a little stronger. 
---
Then you‚Äôll feel like shit again shortly after that until 60. 
---
Warrior on fresh server is just a tough pill to swallow esp on PvP servers. 
---
But I still think the pay off is worth it.
---
It's a 5 minute buff, no one's talking about "running around" with Blessings. It's used to shave seconds off a boss timer.
---
Cynical
---
Look at this to see [Neilyo even refers to this Quote on SK Gaming to confirm](https://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15313-Rogues_HARP_Spec_Nerfed__New_232_Patch_Notes) "The shadowstep buff is good so that a shadowstep isnt fully wasted on moving targets or ones with lag causing their movement to be delayed.

---
I like shaman as well. At lower levels you can also add some dps by just meleeing with flametongue or windfury which makes it a bit more fun.
---
Non-orcs have 19% chance to resist atleast one of the 4 stuns while orcs have 76% chance to resist atleast one. Just more numbers/info.
---
Not bad. If these are just upscaled textures, I wonder if that's something that could be accomplished by an addon?
---
Did your dumb ass miss the part where tips was spamming charge while in a cheap shot?
---
Well they're stupid, even content creators have come out saying that there doesn't seem to be a lot of people and that Blizzard needs to invite way more.
---
I would assume because it was not in vanilla it will not be in classic.  Why would they change that?
---
People like you are the worst. Like wtf r u trying to do by saying this? He doesn‚Äôt give a fuck what you think.
---
Gay
---
You are implying hunters are not generous, you are mean!
---
We let you you all the maces, droods/shamans/priests/paladins/rogues might complain  but hey you are the tanks so you should have priority right?
---
Ah and wands also, no don't say anything, it's really a pleasure for us!
---
Yes of course, it will most likely be at least the same amount of time untill they unlock lvl 50 for beta.
---
This thread is likely to get removed since buying gold is against the ToS and is frowned upon by a lot of people in the community. For what it's worth, I think on most pservers the price for vanilla gold is about $10/100g which is probably a good baseline to start from. Of course that's not gonna be possible right away, but if you're leveling casually I imagine they'll be around that number by the time you hit 60.
---
wasn't worth it since a Furry DPS warr could off tank and swap weapon for insane DPS
---
Nah I have a gameplan this time around lol.
---
I wouldnt go for druid, because they don't have a nomal resurrection spell. Both priest and shaman will do fine. Pre-60 instances arent that hard to heal, as long as you have a res you're good.
---
Moar hotpockets!
---
If I tell you "do what you want/need for every 59 minutes, but if you'll stare at the wall for 1 minute each hour, I'll pay you $10"
---
You don't say: "I'm making $10 per hour of work"
---
You say: "I'm making $10 per minute of work"
---
i see. i feel as if im a more quality of life player and like to provide important perks. what classes would you say are quintessential in the sense you can never have too much of something
---
We‚Äôll raid somewhere between 3-4 hours as an average. It‚Äôll depend on where we are in our progression. At the start it‚Äôll be closer to 4 hours, as we get geared and accustomed to the fights that time will go down. But once the raid time in Molten Core gets low, for example, we will likely start doing Onyxia first, bumping the time back up. I‚Äôd like to be wrapping no later than 10:30, specifically with central coasters in mind, get you guys in bed before 1am
---
Hopefully it will cost you your account.

Meh, it‚Äôs just different. AQ40 and Naxx require a lot of time and effort from your core raiders outside of the raid times. This time commitment can be ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù.

Mythic raiding in retail can literally just be logging on for raid.

Time commitment and mechanical difficulty are two different standards.

&gt; That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we‚Äôre sending out is rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for testing. We‚Äôll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.
---
I'm not a content creator, just a regular dude, but the beta's population seems quite standard to me. What I remembered from the classic days. But I'm sub-20 level wise.
---
it's suppossed to be why we have beta tests. Some companies do it better than others.
---
For example, Bethesda and Bioware doing their "beta" two weeks before release when the game is chock full of bugs where there's absolutely no way in hell they could ever fix them all in time.
---
You can't really blame gamers these days for having their doubts that betas result in things getting fixed. 
---
That being said, the Classic team seems to be working hard and really putting in the effort to make this game as good as it game.

 Bro. Pallies literally cannot keep aggro on non-ud mobs. You‚Äôll literally have a very hard time finishing a dungeon (besides Strat/Scholo) with a prot pal.

Horde keeps out numbering alliance on these classic polls.
---
So he wants a good healer for dungeons pre-60. What if that healer is the shittiest one or the least fun to play at 60 and he ends up re-rolling after spending six months on leveling another? That's something persons not having a lot of time to play should avoid.
---
Shit, not too soapboxy but it's a silly mindset that could apply to all of life. Why eat this apple if it's just gonna become a core, why buy these shoes if my foots just gonna grow, why do anything If I'm going to die.
---
YouTube ‚Äúin frost we trust‚Äù. Amazing video
---
I got to 26 and realized that I don't have it in me to 1-60 again, and on a beta, I'll just burn out before the game goes live. Done it too many times be it on retail or privates already, so I can't find the motivation to level another throwaway character. Rather save up and go full steam on launch :p

How much of a realistic threat difference is there for orc/human vs non-orc/human? if i understand correctly and assuming hit cap, 40%*65% glancing blow + 60%*100% non-glancing blow=86%(.4*.65+.6*1) of the damage of no glancing blows. Vs 40%*65%+60%*1=94% for someone with weapons skill of 305. 86%/94%= ~91.5 meaning a non-orc/human would be dealing 8.5% less white damage than orc/human.
---
What I don't know is how much additional rage that would be, how much the additional rage can be converted to threat, how much threat comes from abilities in the first place. I would suspect that the actual difference in threat would be considerably less than 8.5% but i don't have a great sense of that. 
---
Still, if you were a main tank, presumably you would eventually get thunderfury meaning orcs loose their benefit and the racial advantage only goes to alliance side.
---
Because streamers doing BGs is entertaining.
---
Rhok'delar nice!
---
Shadowformmmmmmm
---
lmfao I knew what it was gonna be and it still gave me a good chuckle when I opened it.
---
These comments give me life. The salt is incredible
---
No they‚Äôre not.. you will eventually destroy yourself. There is no saving you from you. You‚Äôre soul belongs tocclassic
---
same :^)
---
I wish Alliance got portals to SM / RFK / RFD
---
holy fuck this is amazing
---
This depends many classes have vastly different specs when they level and endgame. Take shaman or any healer for example you will most likely be levelling in a dps spec for shamans enhancement ones you hitt 60 wave good by to that spec and hello to resto/healing sure you have might have healed through levelling dungeons but it is vastly different from level 60. Eaven if you are not a healer the play style and spec while levelling will differ from endgame. To get a feel for your class you really need to be level 60. However most classes have new powerfull abilities at 40 and access to most if not all of there kit
---
Yeah, because shitty ideas like this worked so well for retail.
---
In combination with Felstriker it‚Äôs guaranteed hits and critical hits... I‚Äôve seen warriors only melee and not use abilities and they‚Äôll top dps with this combo
---
Same can be said for either. There are people who just raid logged in vanilla. Sure the attunements take time and resist gear farming but not everyone was using consumables and not everyone will. Same with mythic raiding now.
---
You'll get the same bonus gold at 40 so, you'll be okay
---
Does Joana have an addon? And aren't his guides more geared toward the speedrunning side of things? I guess it depends on what your plan is. I'm just gonna use questie (or equivalent) since I'm not trying to speed through anything.
---
The pvp events the streamers have put on ha s their highest viewership. Why not throw it in for bug testing while getting free exposure?
---
Not the green one D:, you could look like an ironforge guard though
---
yeah soul link. probably should've specified but you dont hear somebody referring to a spec with siphon life as SL in vanilla

who cares about a freaking duel tournament? its like 99% of this community has no clue what a beta is actually supposed to be. this has the be the dumbest beta of all time.

I cant wait to watch other people play it... Not, roll on august.

Level cap raising already? Beta has an insane expansion cycle :)

Fucking casual. Respecs ruin character identity. I hate it when people I've met thru the world decide to change spec to play how they want. /Neckbeard

Could have had it in Booty Bay, where if anyone tried to grief they immediately get one-shot by guards.

Mines a montage of getting games while herbing as a prot warrior the struggle is weird.
---
Meh i dont like that they are unlocking this much of the game already.
---
thanks for reminding me D:
---
Much like a kid waiting for Christmas I tell myself "Yes, its 83 days from now. But in 53 days it'll only be 30 days until release. That's one month from now. Its not that bad".
---
my guy
---
The human males look absolutely badass!
---
Even if TBC happens you may have to start all over again anyway. I wouldn't do anything in classic with the thought of helping yourself in TBC, since we both don't know if it will happen at all, and, if it does happen, don't know how it will be implemented.
---
They were insane with healers in PvP. Sweeping strikes just blows up clumped up noobs.
---
My fondest single moment in a BG came early on in AV, a massive battle on the field of strife and me running around clueless and geeking out. That said. I had years of fun in AB, idk how I can keep going back to that well and not be tired of it.
---
I agree it's unlikely but people keep throwing around tons of numbers.  Half of the ones people are throwing around would make 5 weapon skill like a 10-15% damage increase or something, which I think is really unlikely.
---
Until we have a better idea of how much it actually helps I think it's hard to say how necessary it is.  We know it's really really good already.  That's a given.  But how good is the question.
---
I use both
---
Guilds exist on a spectrum with what they expect, there'll be hardcore guilds that'll expect you to farm every advantage possible, and there'll be guilds that won't care what you farm. Just join the guild that matches your level of dedication.
---
Way to miss my point. My point is Alliance doesn't lose their PvE Paladin advantage just because a handful of neckbeards can pally buff their horde for a few minutes.
---
99.9% of horde will never have a pally buff thus the alliance advantage still exists
---
I really hope not!
---
you realize LBRS is literally the same instance? Also seems weird to not include it because its also not a raid because those are 20 or 40man
---
There is a huge difference between a blade having a flaired tip like the one you linked and having a recurve. The flaired tipped blade actually has way more in common with the curved side of Zin'rokh than it does with the recurved side. Let me show you via a [1 minute photoshop](https://imgur.com/a/vmkdxyt).  
---
Furthermore, just like flair tipped blades studded leather armor also is something that never actually existed (in a significant number) due to it being inefficient.
---
That fucking smoke/stench bubble is dope. Not that the entire drawing isn't some great art in general, but I'm fixated on that bubble.
---
Just be glad we will get to start fresh toons without any burnout unless you know your crazy like me and playing pserver a for a refresher on leveling paths.
---
Ahh the tale of Bobby B.
---
:D
---
i'm also on f+f and didnt get invited yesterday, wonder if maybe today
---
Vanilla is not a race to end game content and it is not about power leveling. In fact, I‚Äôm willing to claim that speed leveling is in-fact detrimental. 
---
Besides, all the best quests and leveling paths have been documented for almost 15 years. If you really want to know them, research some guides before launch. 
---
But more importantly: Explore. Quest. Enjoy. Meet people and have fun.
---
he knows
---
Level the main you want for classic.  Make that paladin and only level him on rested a little each week.  You'll ge to 60 with them eventually.
---
What is it like being a low IQ sheep? I'll bet you're subbed to towelliee.
---
Same here. Got lots of work I need to do on the house. I get that done just in time for classic. If I was in the beta the condition of the house would really suffer.
---
Bobby B
---
My third character in vanilla was a female human shadow priest...
---
duno if my arms were that thicc I'd survive
---
I dont keep up with rumors and speculation but I‚Äôve wondered the same thing. If Classic is a sustained success I wonder if they‚Äôll play with the idea of releasing some TBC servers that you could pay to transfer your 60 to.
---
Same here! MC and SM I fell asleep. People were soooo slooooow on hacking through the MC trash. Plus I was playing a Shaman. Imagine slow raids and constant totem micro managing.
---
I see you but do you not understand that pvp is a huge part of wow and the only way to test it is to pvp. So the duel tournament does serve a purpose.
---
He's working on one I think, or someone is working on it for him. I use both Questie and Joana's guide. Questie just tells me where all the quest objective is on the map. Joana's guide tells me which quests to do and in what order to be most efficient with my pathing.
---
Even Joana uses questie when using his own guide.
---
&gt; The ***glitching*** through the walls and climbing up things are ***not bugs***. 
---
hmmmmm
---
Zf dm
---
Questie is just a quest tracker type addon whereas Joana's is an actual guide, So both.
---
&gt; Every week. Don‚Äôt understand why people can‚Äôt just be happy Classic is coming back and get hyped for it.
---
Do you just stick your head in the sand when issues come up? Layering is bad and if it stays for long its horrible
---
I may be wrong in your eyes, but Blizzard has spoken considering they didn't ban the guy for what he did. It's kind of a free speech argument situation.
---
Was he a dick? Yes. Was he annoying? Yes. Did he break the legal ToS by definition? No.
---
What he did by definition wasn't griefing. Anyone can argue a player is "detracting from their enjoyment" but unless the player is stopping someone from finishing a quest or entering an area or accessing a mailbox, it's not griefing.
---
This argument is your feelings vs actual regulations.
---
Now before you downvote. I agree this guy was a dick and shouldn't have done what he did, but I'm just playing the devil's advocate here. As someone who works in Law you see situations like this all the time, people think Justice needs to be served but until Blizz changes their regulations then nothing unjust happened.
---
Lawyered.
---
Nobody "thinks objectively".
---
That entire wall of text is just your opinion.
---
Yep when I healed on my shaman I would often put a flame shock on the focus target if I had the mana (since you won't be pulling aggro, EVER, off the primary target) and do some whacks whenever possible.  Could even do rank 1 shocks if you want to go nuts to interrupt or kite, etc.   Very involved gameplay if you want it to be that way, other than just healing occasionally and watching health bars.
---
finally actual content. been too long since we ran out of it.
---
i don't need it...... HNNNGGGG
---
As a Tauren true believer can confirm. The brotherhood is strong but, it is small.
---
I'm super excited to heal as a Paladin.  Even if that is just putting buffs on people in raid.  I'm there to freedom my warrior friend and watch him wreck people in PvP.
---
We‚Äôll see. This subreddit is a bit more hardcore than most of the playerbase. Many people spam orc/troll for their bis capabilities
---
Hope you realize that this beta is 90% advertisement, as intended by Blizz. So the community is absolutely correct in their expectations.
---
Hunters actually have really good dps with the right setup and pet. Sometimes even top on certain fights. 
---
Rogues are definitely top dps, not sure where you got that impression. 
---
And yes, paladins bring a lot of utility. But you don‚Äôt need rets for that. Just have a bunch of holys and you‚Äôre good. And that‚Äôs why most raids don‚Äôt have a single ret.
---
Maybe as an alt side project down the road, but I wouldn't focus on it in classic.
---
No use dumping effort into something that might be good in the future.
---
We can has mega threads but, don't expect it to clear common questions.
---
I don‚Äôt really know if anyone that only raid logged during AQ40 and Naxx which is about as ‚Äúmythic‚Äù like as vanilla got. Like honestly no one. I never made it into Naxx and my guild never made it past twins but everyone in my guild was on almost every day. Maybe it‚Äôs too anecdotal but some of our rival guilds were basically the exact same - I would imagine this held true for most servers. 
---
For MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 - def agree with you. Significantly less time required for sure.
---
Sush man.. I'm in Beta, and I totally keep my eyes closed as I step over the piles of unwashed laundry and ignore the stair case falling off my patio
---
he is saying unless he is the raid leader or the loot master, the chances are another hunter is going to get the xbow.  That is on top of the low chance it drops instead of the other epics that drop from the boss.  The xbow is a hand of sulfuras type of item, everyone of your class wants it, but not everyone is going to get it when it finally does drop.
---
Never seen that series, but identifying the source of information wouldn‚Äôt discredit the information anyway. I‚Äôll still check it out though
---
Anyway, damage mitigation is not trivial, but I understand why you‚Äôre forced to make that argument since Warriors have objectively better survivability.
---
&gt;Thanks for playing
---
Oh god the cringe
---
I thought under 25 was Gen Z or whatever
---
Thanks
---
I had friends who would on their raiding characters once they got the resist gear needed. Granted they would still log for other stuff if someone wanted to run something. They just weren‚Äôt investing time on their mains.
---
For sure.
---
&gt; They were there before.
---
There were there before 1.11, you're right! Good thing we're on 1.12 and they shouldn't be present.
---
Electro and his gay-sister, Frisbee.
---
Have you found any resources for leveling as a dual boxer? That's the one thing holding me back. I don't want to grind for ages to do collection quests if there are kill quests elsewhere.
---
You can level it doing the last parts of vanilla, you have plenty of time there.
---
I mean I find sub 60 duels really boring too but it's easy to just not watch them so just relax
---
Okay then don‚Äôt press RANDOM how about that
---
that.... seems like a major component...
---
Surprised to see Rogues, Paladins, and Hunters so far on the bottom of the class poll. These results seem to change every week lol
---
No, you've missed my point.
---
In simply completing content, the perceived advantage is null. The content is easy. Any 40 people with 10 brains between them is going to complete it. It won't be more difficult for Alliance or Horde in any measurable fashion.
---
The ONLY type of Hardcore PVE left in Classic is speedrunning and number rankings and since you DO use Paladin buffs as Horde there, there is no advantage for Alliance.
---
Sweeping strikes is deep arms and you won't be getting that ability if you're going for the 2 hand fury spec. You'll most likely get improved cleave, improved slam, and bloodthirst.  
---
2h Fury damage primarily comes from death wish, bloodthirst, whirlwind, and slam (talented) while the talents from the arms tree that are beneficial are anger management, tactical mastery, improved overpower, and impale. 
---
This is an example of a 2h fury build:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AyMzcwXwEw9DQAA
---
Yes, you can, albeit with low graphical settings.
---
I've played it on a laptop just fine with integrated graphics (one 3-4 years older than the 630).
---
As long as I can toggle it off/on they can implement bfa models for all I care
---
at most it is 6%
---
You can‚Äôt fury tank w/o TF?
---
Avoiding guns is easy as thier are so few good ones.
---
I'm fucking buzzing to watch streams progress to 40 now
---
Some people want level 60 asap. 
---
I know I do because I plan  on main tanking for my guild and I have a lot of stuff I need to do before I can raid. 
---
Fishing, cooking, bis gear before raid gear. 
---
And again guides aren't the same as actually doing the content yourself.
---
Well even blizzards facebook classic poll had more horde.
---
Improved Mindblast is a 0/5 not 0/3.
---
Spirit Tap is overrated unless you are solo, even then I have a hard time justifying it, since I can just wand things to death.  If this isn't a leveling spec, then I don't know why you would take ST.  If it is a leveling spec, I don't know why you wouldn't take wand.  Even if it is an end-game spec, I'm not sure why you are passing on wand.
---
So your end goal is it World PVP? BGs? Group PVP? Dungeons? Raids? Questing and other solo content? All of those have different classes that excel.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=292101/classic-beta-updates-level-cap-increased-to-40-arathi-basin-beta-respec-costs
---
I think he's right, its like 1995 is the cut off or something...
---
No not a leveling guide tailored to multiboxing. I just do the same thing when solo and skip the turn in if I've received an equivalent amount of exp killing the mobs for the collection quest.
---
I agree. 
---
I always say integration is the main thing we all need to focus on. The United States is based on immigrants successfully integrating into the culture and becoming one (going the opposite direction lately)
---
I was not aware Scandinavians were having similar issues!
---
I really can't explain why but I've always felt more at home playing horde characters. Every time I played and raided in alliance guilds I always felt like I was just "visiting".
---
Maybe the Osconty gnome thing was really just them tipping their hat to release for an open beta. If we reveive the meme, does that make it a leper gnome?
---
Thanks. I didn't realize crippling MH was the meta in Vanilla. Good to know. I'm assuming then that it's the same with other utility poisons? I.e. Crippling MH/Wound OH for healers and Crippling MH/Mindnumbing OH for Mages?
---
Tips was making this point and I agree. From the outside looking in it would appear streamers were favored in the beta invites and while it's cool for streamers to do massive world pvp raids and the like, some actual testing needs to be done. Things like hitbox and armor value testing while not entertaining, is the point of a beta. Not that there aren't people doing these things but it's not happening at the level it probably should be.
---
Or, it is Towelliee! DUN DUN DUUUUUN!
---
enhan shamys will wreck everyone.
---
You don't need 5/5 on shadow weaving 4/5 is enought. And Shadow focus is a must, so drop the point in improved vampiric embrance or spirit tap if it's your lvl 60 build.
---
They should let you give your beta invite to someone else, dammit!
---
I would pay more to not have that on my item
---
I mean there's only so many ways to increase weapon skill outside of racials and a handful of weapons/specific armor pieces...
---
I believe Nightfall was actually the achievement for killing Sartharion with 3 drakes. It granted the "of the Nightfall" title and a drake mount.
---
83 days to practice my leveling route on a pserver.
---
I may hit lvl34 by then....
---
I don't see the error speech issue anywhere, posted about it before but, your character has virtually no error speech. It says "Out of range" once per mob. If you check old pvp videos the error speech is almost constant.
---
Damage mitigation is trivial - the meta in 1.12 is bear tanks and DW warriors. Healers who wear actual BiS instead of tier will keep you up easily now that they get more than 5 FPS. 
---
Warriors get the edge in TPS when they get TF due to the threat of the debuff it applies. TPS is king. Warriors are going sub 440 defense intentionally in favor of aggressive stats. 
---
Go watch Skarm on YouTube and get woke.
---
&gt;90% advertisement
---
Not even close, but ok
---
What the actual fuck....
---
Yikes.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if horde ends up being the majority. Most pservers were 52-55% horde
---
Is it really like 1999 or more like eq2 time locked where its just the current game with level cap decreased and some stuff disabled?
---
Yeah, do not forget that as with most questionaires there will be a skew. The first skew is to the populous of general reddit compared to classic wow, then the specific sub compared to specific wow...
---
I'd actually love that. 
---
There'd be much less pressure to level fast and the tryhards who play 14 hours a day won't be miles ahead of people who can only put in a reasonable amount of time.
---
It also makes every release like a new community event. Like a mini AQ.
---
Of course it won't happen. Tryhards need to feel good nolifing and being as far ahead of others as possible, whatever it takes to make them feel impressed with themselves üòÇ
---
He's taking about not upgrading his buffs for his raid.
---
Yeah, agreed there.
---
That is correct.
---
When Classic drops aren't Add-ons going to be a few days/weeks later?
---
I highly doubt there will be functioning add-ons available the day of launch right?
---
Or will people just use the BETA client to create Add-Ons?
---
It really depends on your weapons and on your gear level and what buffs you have available. I don't think there's a cut and dry answer, but in general 1H is comparatively better the more gear and buffs you have. You can have a look at the warrior discord, http://discord.gg/RbCZJtw, in particular there should be a spreadsheet which you can play around with to get a general feel for what's good.
---
Correct, in those times information was lacking. People did not know a lot of things. Now, most of the new players will know the full difference in abilities between human and dwarf priests. Plus if you are rolling a human priest it will be a female that is why I said Male Human Priest.
---
&gt;all these people
---
&gt;3 replies
---
pick one
---
I think the only positions i agree with are the priests &amp; warriors at the top... people will always play the most op stuff!
---
The Chance derives solely from relative level between what you're attacking and you, it doesn't factor in weapon skill at all. You'd have 40% chance to score a glancing blow if you had 300 weapon skill or 350.
---
You're reading the correct numbers, but the reason there's that  \~10% chance difference has nothing to do with deltaSkill, and everything to do with +1 lvl.
---
Wonder why the horde surged in popularity. Back in the day Alliance was the popular one.
---
Delete your reply before the aforementioned no lifers start sperging out
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. I started leveling a character on a burning crusade pserver and had to make myself stop because I knew I'd spend all of my WoW energy before classic even comes out...
---
Looking at it now, I don‚Äôt really have an answer for you.  I have a bunch of screenshots I found on an ancient photobucket account from back then.  This one made me laugh the most.
---
I'm a big fan of the time locked progression approach. However, once a server got past wotlk I'd jump to the new one.
---
You might want to join up in the second quest hub at level 5 or at level 10 for a smoother launch.
---
Obviously it's a PVP spec. Use your noodle. It's still wrong though.
---
It's new because everytime it's posted people go "OMG that's a private server emulation, classic is gon' be totally different."
---
Good advice, at the same time I hate conditioning and mindfulness. That is why millions are working harder than ever. "Hey, can you find a way to make people work harder and endure more stress?" "SURE!" "TADAA - mindfulness - just walk on coal, bed of nails and work til you are burnt out, all without noticing it! Do you have Amazon as employer? JUST PUT ON SOME RELAXING MUSIC!"
---
Here is the crux; Mindfulness / relaxation is in fact a distraction from the objective reality. I don't want to be relaxed when the world is falling apart. I don't want to be happy when I am supposed to be depressed. I don't want to be calm when I am supposed to be angry. This is why so many people are confused because of the rapid and manipulative change of emotional states. Yes, you are supposed to be able to regulate. Yes you are not supposed to just burst out in anger when someone cuts you off in traffic. 
---
The problem is when it is done during a long time and it turns you passive to your surrounding. It is basically "Brave New World" but without the drug somna (or anti-depressant). What he didnd't forsee was that they don't even need a drug, people would self-regulate / manipulate their emotional state instead of been given a drug. 
---
I am not saying this is the truth. Come up with your own conclusion. Just be careful and be critical. Many spiritual people are brainwashed by this and I was too. (Spent hundred of hours of meditating and been on numerous of retreats)
---
Certainly over gearing it. But I tanked instances and a lock too lol
---
&gt;Blizzard is so stupid clearly the streamers have a better perspective on how many players the beta NEEDS than blizzard
---
You realize that "there doesn't seem to be a lot of people" can coexist with "there are enough people for a beta test"?
---
FFS I don't know what it is with you people. Do you for real trust the word of streamers over the BLIZZARD developers? Come the fuck on lol. 
---
Just makes you sound stupid.
---
Not enough strawmen, gonna need more
---
I know it's not vanilla but in cata when it first came out I wanted to get all my characters to Max so I stayed up for well over 24 hours grinding it out. At some point I just passed out in my chair
---
Nice flair
---
Isnt there a meme about wow ui's with this exact pic lol
---
The good ol days before random bodies of land kept magically appearing.
---
Yeah but will want to mount the second I hit 40. Just going to be frugal with my gold as I level from 30 to 40.
---
So long...
---
&gt;Why are they testing BG's? 
---
Is basically your question. They're doing it now because they have time, and players, obviously. Why does it matter when they do it? This question is flawed at a basic level.
---
There are still things that aren't racials that can boost your weapon skill. Edgemaster's Handguards is the meme example, but there are others, like the Distracting Dagger from Dire Maul, and the Expert Mining Helmet lvl 33 boe. My point is less that Only Humans Can Tank, and more that people who don't get a racial should do themselves a favor and try to dust up a +5 weapon skill from somewhere.
---
I agree with other reply, please share :)
---
Watch this video from Preach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iq8AEEUYy0.
---
It basically boils down to making a new character on a class you already know. And as you level up keybind all your abilities, it'll be easier since you learn them one at a time.
---
I would also recommend keybinding on a keyboard. If you're dedicating yourself to relearning your input method you might as well do it right.
---
An ageing playerbase? Horde have always had a higher average age!
---
It's funny because I remember when they were doing them they were talking about how important it was to make sure they stayed true to the old models.
---
"throw it in for bug testing"? 
---
Yeah, right, not as if the express purpose of the beta is bug testing, nope, not at all...........................................
---
I saw the one earlier and it looks close. I can prove this is original and mine tho if you would like.
---
His mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass, did you know that?

---
Oh God. We had 2 great guilds. 
---
First guild was a hardcore raiding guilded call 
---
&lt;BEEP BEEP IMA JEEP&gt; 
---
They fell apart due to guild drama. The main guys stopped raiding and pvpd for high warlord. There new guild was called 
---
&lt;IMAWHALE OORAOORA&gt;
---
I'll always remember those
---
I purposely chose stupid arguments to draw parallels to, and highlight, what I think is a stupid idea. 
---
Sorry that wasn‚Äôt clear enough.
---
Everything that works in BETA will work on Classic launch.
---
I would say exactly like the first way in both examples. "Skinning made me 1.25g per hour". Because that's the acual amount per hour of gametime it got me while leveling. 
---
Someone that says "Skinning made me 42.86g per hour" while they acually gaining \~145g over the time of 4days 23.5 hours. I'd call them a complete madman.
---
Stringing together 8000 instances of 1.5 seconds over the timespan of minimum 4 days and slap a gold per minute on it is absolutly the work of someone who's completely mad.
---
That‚Äôs a fair point. I don‚Äôt want to burn out before release.
---
i guess mostly world pvp with casual raiding.  end game i just want to play with people and be utilized
---
Holy shit, I just watched your [Skarm video](https://youtu.be/mNGo5SMeqgo) and it is scathing. Anyone still reading this thread should absolutely watch and realize how full of shit this guy is. Even worse then I thought.
---
Thanks for confirming the 1.12 Meta is does NOT include Druids outside of niche events.
---
Yeah I think its called vanillahelper
---
I think the 6 percent is what is most supported in the Github table they present. The Blizzard response is not clear to me, as they only mention the reduction of the modifier and not the spike when going from 304 to 305.   
---
The data suggests removal of modifier + spike of 1 %, effectively 2 %.
---
But that's what I'm here for üòÇ
---
But that‚Äôs two words
---
I guess that‚Äôs fair. Like I said - mine may be completely anecdotal and not representative at all of the majority.
---
You are wrong in everything you say.  Warrior can be top dps when not tanking, while feral is bottom. Warrior in dps spec but tank gear is still better tank than feral. Dmg done as tank is irrelevat. Threat done as ot is never an issue  anyway so no need to gimp yourself by bringing a feral.  You are not allowed to use bleeds in cat form anyway.
---
Really? Ok. Vanilla vet myself. Known about the hit cap, wpn skill for years.
---
Yeah, it helps. And a lot of tanks for alliance will be human. But it can be overcome by skill, gear, etc. Best fury warrior I ever met was a gnome named Alarr. Loved that dude.
---
Gotta get the good stuff, I got the hookup for the blindweed.
---
And Vanilla WoW shares a lot of philosophy from Everquest. Not apples to oranges here.
---
I'm glad to hear of the improvements, and of the continued development.  I was a huge part of the WoWhead community from when it started up through Cata.  I wrote the DK PVP guide which was stickied on the class forums through the whole WOTLK expansion, and I had some comments on healing enchants in Cataclysm that went green as well.
---
After MOP hit, there started to be a lot less discussion and I lost interest in the game and the community.  I'm hoping to be back on WoWHead like mad in Classic.
---
This is going to be a bloodbath.  
---
I'm so happy.
---
Really like 1999.
---
*cyclone berzerks my way to shaper*
---
Check bank, mail and such. If they're not there it's most possibly a bug. If you can't buy new tools even though you don't have them anymore, report it :)
---
Oh, I guess. Seems like a crappy thing to do, lying to your guild/raid group. Not my chair...
---
It lines up with the test results.
---
3 lvls above and no plus weaponskill:
---
**8.36% ¬±0.82%** misses. Formula expects 8%.
---
3 lvls above and +2 weaponskill:
---
**7.83% ¬±1.55%** misses. Formula expects 7.6%.
---
3 lvls aabove and +5 weaponskill:
---
**6.37% ¬±0.77%** misses. Formula expects 6%.
---
So yes, it seems likely that it works like that, even though it is strange.
---
That was beautiful to read.
---
Paladins can tank all the dungeons just fine and off-tank a few fights in raids, but, you won't MT anything. you're gonna either have to respec to Holy for raiding, or spec 20/31/0, or pray they take you for a Nightfall swinger if you wanna raid as Protection.
---
Why? 100% hit is impossible in PvP  
---
Rank 1: 96% -&gt; 98% (2 for the cost of 2)  
---
Rank 2: 98% -&gt; 99% (1 for the cost of 2)  
---
Rank 3: 99% -&gt; 99% (0 for the cost of 2)
---
The quest is still time gated by lock outs.
---
It's just an example of someone with +3 weaponskill. Don't read too much into it.
---
Only dicks use questie, fact.
---
Don't be so daft. It's clear the priority invites are not for bug testers.
---
I'm thinking about doing a warrior/priest combo. Both because I think it'd be more efficient to level two at a time than to level them back to back, and because I'd like to spice up what is a somewhat boring process.
---
Blizzard is spacing this out really well actually. Pleasantly surprised how well they manage it all so far. I desperately hope there will be some major fixes upcoming as well though. Would be great to see.
---
/r/thathappened zzz
---
day 1 hour 1 :)
---
I know it's hard to comprehend.
---
A couple things:
---
1. FP from Tanaris to Un'Goro
---
2. Mispell on Ahn'Quira (isn't it Ahn-Quiraj?)
---
Every healing class is fine pre-60. Druids don't get a normal rez, so that's the only real knock against them.
---
If there was a curse out you literally couldn‚Äôt see anything!!  Lol thanks for sharing this
---
I will be seriously impressed if a non-streamer actually gets the scarab lord mount.
---
Also: I dont think we got experience in vanilla if the pet killed the mob without the hunter doing damage. Is that still the case?
---
I'd be surprised if classic release was as toxic as the sweaty boi private servers.  There will be a ton of new players to classic who will hopefully be less toxic and eager to learn
---
Shadow reach allows for a much further dot .... you can avoid charge from a warrior and force and intercept. 
---
Mind blast is your main nuke ...... you want it
---
Spirit tap is not useful in PVP, from what I recall none or very little of priest PVP or even plus damage gear had spirit .... only plus healing gear had spirit so the talent is only good for leveling not even farming.
---
The Feral BiS weapon is already hilarious. A level 29 blue from Gnomer.
---
Ill join any guild called cheeky nandos
---
Cool thanks for the info!
---
Wtf are we supposed to do until then :(
---
Might be a stupid concern but I'm really afraid giving so much content to play and stream in the beta is going to burn most if not all the hype people have by the time it gets released.
---
The few hardcore WoW streamers will probably play live too, but I fear a great amount of people that got the beta or watched a lot of streams will be less tempted to play, and there might be less hype for events like the pvp tournament we've seen this weekend.
---
Am I crazy to think that ?
---
It's perfectly clear, it's just a bad argument when you could just simply describe why gating levels at 30, 40, 50, 60 every week at launch makes for a worse game.
---
I can see a couple arguments, like speed running being affected or nolifers not feeling superior at being as far ahead of the normal crowd.
---
The rest of the end-game content is time-gated, it's not really fundamentally different from the level cap being time-gated, especially when it's really minor by just a week
---
A strong woman orc is the best women!(‚ó†Ôπè‚ó†‚úø)
---
PVP and plus damage gear had no or little spirit .....
---
Go into the mountains and freeze yourself.
---
Are there any addons that show dot timers? Knowing when stuff is about to fall off is pretty handy
---
Thanks, Perculia!
---
Your team (and you!) always put a ton of work in. I hope they all realize how appreciated they are!
---
Underrated comment imo. That Peggle addon got me through many flights and wait times for ships and trams back in the day
---
Those damn guards.. Always killing my aggressive mobs and stealing my credit. &gt;:(
---
Try to remember this sub is an EXTREME minority of what the playerbase will be come Classic launch.
---
&gt; Sweeping strikes is deep arms and you won't be getting that ability if you're going for the 2 hand fury spec. 
---
I know that. I should've specified that it wasn't that, or trying to be that. My bad.
---
I'd prefer they remaster everything if they did it.
---
5 minute buffs seem pretty isolated in what speedruns they can even be applied to. Buff a raid with a pally buffs so you can use them for maybe the first boss before they run out? Probably not really worth it. You going to rebuff pally buffs before every boss to get speedrun times on individual bosses? I highly doubt the top end speed runners are doing this despite your guild apparently having been doing it for "years". 
---
All that aside the original question was why your post was downvoted/controversial and you claimed it was butthurt Alliance players which again I highly doubt is the case
---
since these are both AoEs won't they be expensive, especially on launch when everyone wants them?
---
they are going to have to cast a full 2 second corruption if they want soul link
---
WC, SM, ZF, and all the 55+ ones.
---
Course I'll be visiting almost every dungeon
---
How can someone get baited to use WotF?
---
Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die!
---
I see, thanks for clarifying.
---
I typed out a paragraph response but this is a rather meaningless discussion that won‚Äôt go anywhere. Just gonna leave it there.
---
Watch out everyone, it‚Äôs the no-fun police.
---
I really hate how they are doing classic beta invites. I don't want to watch 3 months of streamers having fun while I get to sit and wait while staring at an empty email inbox. 
---
Requiring an active retail sub just to get entered into the beta invite lottery yet giving a multitude of streamers a key that didn't have active subs so that you can get free publicity is greedy and disingenuous. God forbid Mr. Youtuber/Twitch streamer has to wait in line like everyone else. 
---
*laughs in Nesingwary Camp*
---
Or since I know it‚Äôs not going to happen - I can just ignore this and by pass all that effort.
---
What travel time for SM?  Undercity is right there.
---
Time to get a group is going to be the same for a lot of dungeons.  Viable loot and quest rewards are another major factor.  For example, a human rogue is going to get most of the deadmines quests anyway, and basically 3 of the 4 drops off of the final boss are good for rogues.
---
Casters will want to do SFK regardless of faction, because those shoulders are going to probably last you into your 50s.  (I'm leveling a priest on a private server, I'm level 43 and there isn't anything close to those shoulders yet).  
---
If you have a warrior or druid, or you have a healy button (so also a druid), you have the advantage of finding groups faster.  Mages are also in high demand.
---
The dungeons themselves aren't worth it over questing, but if you can get a group fast, the dungeon + dungeon quests can be pretty good.  
---
Last thing - if your class has quests that go into a dungeon, you most likely want to do that dungeon.  Paladins going for their weapon (which will make a Ret Paladin top damage charts up until level 30 or so), Warriors going for armor, everyone going into Sunken Temple.
---
I wouldn't unless you just want a chance to be part of a stress test. As many here can vouch for, it does not seem like they give preferential treatment to old accounts and someone else in this thread mentioned that Blizz is slowing down remaining invites, so the majority of people that were gonna get in are already in. You might get an invite to a stress test but I would just try to contain the excitement and wait until release at this point.
---
Maraudon, Stratholme, Scholo, UBRS and LBRS
---
The hogger spawn zone is called 'Forest's Edge' Not Fores's Edge' As in the map.
---
Thanks for this, will probably reconsider rolling a Hunter knowing Blizzard's track record tbh.
---
The vast majority of Druid‚Äôs will never get that weapon. The Mace of Unending Life is available from AQ20 and is relatively simple to get. I‚Äôm just looking for the best comparators, rather than TUF.
---
Well not like mine isn‚Äôt anecdotal.
---
&gt; #some people
---
True. 
---
I've always been weary about Add-ons so early on in a game/launch, much like how I'd never buy a Phone or Console on the day or week of release.
---
Bugs and excessive patching and errors etc. I feel like after the first week the good Add-ons will be obvious and will have been hotfixes enough that I'm not spending time updating or fucking with them too much.
---
&gt;Current Everquest has multiple "timelocked" servers. When the server goes live, it's just like 1999.
---
Maybe I'm being a bit pendantic here but this is pretty far from the truth.
---
I've played for a few years across some of the EQ TLP (time-locked progression) servers and I'd *much* rather have what Blizzard is attempting with Classic.
---
Imagine if WoW was level-capped at 60 and you could only travel in the original Azeroth zones; that's essentially what playing on a TLP server is. They try to bandaid away most of the modern features of the game, but it's still nothing like playing on a truly recreated classic version of the game.
---
&gt;Everquest has EPIC quests. These quests give a legendary item to a class. These quests span multiple raids, multiple zones, and easily last 100+ hours to complete. In Everquest there would be one epic quest for a class. Usually a weapon piece with a particle effect.
---
Yeah, no doubt, epic quests were really cool. Imagine a legendary weapon per class, but it's a much more involved quest than "get really lucky and loot two Bindings of the Windseeker." The best part of epic quests is that they're so involved, usually you can start working on yours even if you're a casual player or not quite at max level yet. 
---
EverQuest also had some some epic-scale quests outside of the class quests. The most notable of which is the diabolical [Breakdown in Communication](http://www.bonzz.com/bic.htm). You think Scarab Lord is impressive? HA!

Hi everyone!
---
&lt;Incarnation&gt; is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community.   
---
We are a fresh guild, meaning that we do not have ‚Äúcore members‚Äù or ‚Äúclicks‚Äù like many other guilds. Just because we are fresh does not mean we lack experience, in fact we have a wide range of experience ranging from bleeding edge Naxxaramas clears in original Vanilla WoW, private server naxx, server first endgame content of different expansions of WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including rank 14 in vanilla wow, rank 1 gladiators across various expansions and even pro gaming experience through various games.   
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining. We expect you to know your class, game mechanics, and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic. We intend to use raid time efficiently that it doesn‚Äôt require an excessive amount of time to clear content.  If our goals match your own feel free to apply  Obligatory exceptional players considered.   
---
**Class Priority:** 
---
**High:**  Mage

**Medium:**  Fwar, Priest

**Low:** Druid (resto)

I've created a subreddit for late night raiding guilds. Late night guilds recruitment gets loss in the crowd of guilds that raids at peak hours so I've made a list of all the late night raiding guild I've found. For NA, I'd consider peak hours being 6 to midnight EST and late night being any raid that starts after midnight EST or close to it.
---
So if you're looking for a late night raiding guild or you're recruiting for one, check out the classic wow late night subreddit.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowlatenight)
---
female dwarf and female troll. not many people related to the weird shape of those females and picked them.
---
You can, but you won't get the beta for being subbed. People have been subbed for months or years and haven't gotten in, plus they already basically announced that they have enough people and will be inviting little to 0 more.
---
Woah, how did you read my mind?
---
IDK time gates content is one of the bigger complaints of current wow.
---
I'm honestly thinking about picking a server and making 8 rogues and getting full defias sets on all of them.
---
I don‚Äôt think you have a choice!
---
3-4.  Anyone who rang the gong within 1 hour of the first ringer got it as I recall.
---
There were several on my server.
---
Not as well as shadow priest / warlock. VE lets the lock lifetap, shadow weaving, bonus stamina, heals for your pet.
---
why no UBRS?
---
If you haven't been invited yet, you most likely won't receive one. They've stated a few weeks ago, invites were going slow and was reducing drastically over the next few days. So technically it's at a bare minimum at this point, if even anybody gets invited.
---
Nat Pagels does more damage :/
---
Just do lore-based class quests, like from Legion. 
---
Make them unique and difficult.
---
Release them a little bit after naxx is released
---
Also karazhan after naxx like they wanted
---
WHO NAMED YOU?  SOME HALFWIT WITH A STUTTER?
---
There is a hat off a world dragon with dagger skill, and a DM belt with skill. Daggers have a ton of pretty accessible +skill items, and some with pretty good stats. Any race is equally good for daggers. The difference between daggers and swords has always been much smaller than the gap in skill between rogues.
---
You are correct about Vanilla.
---
In fact, I don't think pets even tagged mobs.  Nor did debuffs that did 0 damage (even a dot before the tick).
---
A prot warrior is top dps when not tanking? No, what you're saying is nonsense. DPS warrior in tank gear sure, they could out dps feral, but they won't tank as well guaranteed.
---
&gt;Damage done a tank is irrelevant, threat is never an issue
---
You must have trash dps then
---
Hunter is one of the best world PVP class, just stand back and nuke. Can run away and choose when to engage ..... and Hunters are not that gear dependent and taming pets is a cool thing to do solo. Keep in mind hunters have very little gear competition in raids.
---
Also if you are a good hunter it really shows. One of the highest skill differences since there are a lot of bad hunters.
---
Good thing I did not waste time griding Level30 Gear.
---
And if you don't have the beta?
---
well if TF cememts your threat, and Fury tank is needed for more threat, i feel TF should come first, then if you need more threat go fury
---
It's amazing what you can accomplish in a fear.
---
Hi, I visited Wowhead the other day to look at the classic site and was surprised to see a bunch of comments from much later patches on the database. I was just wondering if there's a plan to wipe/prune it down to comments that are classic-era appropriate?
---
The number per server is going to depend on guild cooperation on banging the gong.
---
Realistically, with cooperation, 3-4 per large guild would be my guesa.
---
If you're farming then the question is what are you farming?
---
If you chose the right mobs(low armor/health) then Daggers won't hurt you that much because you'll kill things faster than they hurt you.
---
If you're fighting mobs that take a while to kill and have you in combat longer then Daggers start to fall off real quick.
---
I played a Sub Rogue in Vanilla (Only leveled, not at 60) and I found Daggers were fun if I picked the right enemies.
---
Well... Since I was a kid I always thought azshara looked like someone spitting on their dick.
---
The current EQ progression servers are nothing analogous to what Classic is trying to be.  They have cash shops, experience changing, instanced raids, new UI and character models.  Imagine if you took BFA and just shoved everything changed into Vanilla.  That wouldn't be Classics goal.  
---
Project 1999, which will open (theoretically, mostly just a strong suspicion) a green server in October (EQ patch for path to its third expansion) is more like what Classic is doing.  That is, a preservation project.  I highly recommend anyone interested in a classic Everquest experience to dodge retail EQ and play Project 1999.
---
If Blizzard followed what Daybreak has been doing with EQ, Classic wouldn't have the kind of hype that it currently does.
---
Some of the dungeons are worth it to run with friends once so you can complete the quests and some of them have really good items to pick up to help you level faster.
---
How so? Just like at 60, they're decent at best.
---
imagine you are fighting a player in pvp.  first they fight you and do a couple heals until their mana is low.  then they full heal instantly.  then they do an immune to physical shield to get another clutch heal in around 50% health.  Then they do a final shield and press their hearthstone to make the previous events of the battle like some kind of flash back or dream sequence.  15 minutes later they are back to judging and stunning you cause they flew back in with their cooldowns ready for another 20 minute round 2.
---
Hrm. On pservers couldn't do this. Do you remember doing this from vanilla or beta?
---
Sure. That's why I think you should try to get your hands on one of them.
---
So I'm speaking mostly of 19 and 29 twinks as those brackets are the most popular on the private server scene. BIS twink gear is a mixture of dungeon blues, quest rewards, and BOE greens. The grind is really just leveling the character up. If you have the gold you can acquire all the BIS gear in an afternoon. Buy all the BOE gear and enchants from the AH and have a guild member run you through dungeons for the BOPs. On LH I had several 19/29 twinks without ever leveling a main to 60. I was able to find them with fishing and AH flipping. The twinks guilds I was in was just a community of people who enjoyed wow pvp but had no interest in the 60 grind, raiding scene, or honor grind.
---
Tbc also renders classic irrelevant
---
That weird goblin mongoloid on the right is deffinetly asmongold
---
We've already done a round of pruning with both comments and screenshots, but as Wowhead didn't exist for most of vanilla, we included some comments from the expansion after as it's still useful for quests which didn't change location.
---
We may consider pruning items more but leaving quests alone.
---
&gt; Anyone who rang the gong within 1 hour of the first ringer got it as I recall.
---
10 hours, I think.
---
69
---
Check out North.
---
It's nothing like 1999.
---
If you were silly like me, you have already done most of the camp quests for the rewards at lvl 30 and are slightly upset you won't be able to get exp from doing them again
---
No wonder your dumb ass needed dbm lmao
---
DM and all of the Black Rock Mountain instances were favorites of mine.
---
Lol fair point.
---
At the end of the day I think knowledge and overall skill increases will make classic raiding significantly less hardcore than it had been previously back in vanilla. 
---
I still think it‚Äôs pretty ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù time investment wise during those later raids for the average player/game rather than skill requirements. 
---
Just my thoughts. 
---
Alternatively - classic is, in a way, a ‚Äúbeatable‚Äù game - so there is a clear end goal unlike the modern version of the game.
---
Exactly my thinking too.
---
I'm waiting for "wtf 1/100 respec cost aint classic."
---
If we are on the topic of cool maps, [this guy Greywolf made some cool scaled and labeled ones for use in the WOW RPG](http://greywolf.critter.net/wow/travel.htm#travel), they've been a great resource for me (I converted them to hexes as well). They're pretty cool!
---
This is a classic wow sub, go ask somewhere else
---
Nope - watched it again just to be sure. No need to be dishonest, he lays out the pros and cons of both classes. His ultimate conclusions are what I said in my last post. Just because you‚Äôve decided on a warrior doesn‚Äôt mean you need to feel threatened by druids tanking. 
---
Druids are a close second to warriors in raids, and have a TPS advantage in early tiers. Druids fit well into an OT role due to one of their talents but they can tank almost everything  in Vanilla raiding just fine. Skarm plays both a druid and a warrior. 
---
Here is him tanking Naxx on his Druid...

Like wtf were they waiting for?  Wasn't there supposed to be 3 big alliance tourney's happening?  It makes zero sense.
---
Anybody has a solid alliance guide for 1-30? Used Joana's up until now but that's where it ends.
---
Crap what do I level to 40 first. Priest is still only 23 but I want shadow form so badly. But then you got mage portals, or oh shit boom kin form. Exciting!
---
Beautiful
---
I think TBC is inevitable.  But I also think the servers will be standalone, meaning you'd have to level fresh on any TBC server without transfers.
---
There will not be any servers beyond classic. They‚Äôre going to spend this time to create wow2
---
[deleted]
---
&gt; Is basically your question. They're doing it now because they have time, and players, obviously.
---
Ah so then what your basically saying then is that they won't have players and time after launch, gotcha.
---
I would say about 2 - 4 players per realm. If people would give others time to complete the quests it could be many. However I don't think people will make deals like that with more then one or two, if at all. To me it seems likely that at least one ally and one horde top guild would have a player complete the chain.
---
Reminds me of the time I fell asleep in between heroic rag pulls in firelands. Had to work some crazy hours and still was raiding. That was the night we downed him too which makes it so much more memorable
---
Please read my comment, head post isn't my post. Also it's Ahn'Qiraj.
---
pservers award more quest exp after 30.
---
Well yeah it‚Äôs not really a discussion as much as it is you trying to rationalize a quip
---
Just 40 box 40 NE hunters and jump people on roads.  One multishot should take care of pretty much any group of 5 running by.
---
Im guessing its the min maxers who are following classic news closely and responding to this. Tons of people wont care about classic until launch
---
Thats actually a great idea, because I am for one really would like som improved character models, although I am not sure how well they would fit in a world with those old models, so a toggle would be perfect?
---
3-4 per guild max maybe ( more if several groups )
---
Multiplied by guilds who go hard enough for it
---
Dwarf. Priest.
---
This would be an amazing addon!
---
People should do whatever they want. The point of 'random' beta testing is for people to do what they want to, and then report whatever bugs they find. Like, Sodapoppin, Esfand and for sure not Tisput probably weren't invited for their skills and understanding of mechanics, but probably as advertisement and because they're some of the people known for playing WoW. Now look at random people like us getting invited, we're invited to do whatever we want as well, not everybody have to be this magical 'cog' in the system making the machinery work. Just by playing the game you are helping Blizzard. You don't have to be Perplexity or Monkeynews testing out bugs for 10+ hours a day when the beta launched.
---
People are acting like just because you're in the beta, you have to make some sort of commitment. I bet there's people invited who's not even giving it a try or know about it as well.
---
the good thing is those addons won't change unless blizzard does changes to their API between beta ending and release
---
Troll master race!
---
ridiculously strong pvp racials
---
As long as they dont raise cap to 60 during beta I don't think so.
---
No plate really exists at 40 lol only the chest which should be easy to get and the rest are very high level quest rewards.
---
With how the gaming community is now I highly doubt there will be any level of cooperation or truces like we saw back during Vanilla.
---
Literally unplayable
---
1 streamer guild whore per server
---
Hahahahahah wtf was that rant.
---
I find it amusing how many people think that raids are going to be conforming to what you listed, when in reality 95% will be taking whatever healers they can get
---
Shaman druid and pally, pally a little less than sham and druid sometimes is less or just barely beats them, and thats split between 2 factions not 1
---
If that worked our double druid idea should work too. A bear should take slightly less damage which would allow my wife to go balance.
---
This is a known bug
---
I read through your list and had fond memories of so many.  Thanks.
---
Sure but those work a lot better for dps than they do with tanking I imagine as you sacrifice survivability. Unless you are building a TPS set i suppose.
---
Haha. That's the trick. Find a guild that raids when you aren't tired! I worked overnight, got in Aussie guild. We started at 7am for me!
---
Lol. This is how I handle work shifts. Too real.
---
Only streamers
---
Yes they are.  Confirmed
---
Vanillaguide looks good

Time to stream snipe and pk the mages?
---
Have you tried the MX518 ? Logitech just recently put it on sale again.
---
11 chars?

For anyone hoping for invites: They're probably not inviting many more, if any. This is from a few weeks back:
---
&gt;That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we‚Äôre sending out is  rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for  testing. We‚Äôll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as  we go through the testing process. 
---
Unless they change their minds, the invites have probably stopped quite some time ago, which makes sense, since we're not seeing any more of these "I got in" threads.
---
I strongly disagree, as long as we are not talking about raiding.
---
Only in AV
---
Unemployed because of wow? How convenient.
---
Discussing it and dictating how it should be played when your not even gonna play it?
---
Exactly my point.
---
It's gonna be so nice playing classic in 4k with the screen real estate haha.  I had some pretty rough UIs back in the day on my crap lower res monitors.
---
this happened last time too, it‚Äôs just a visual bug.
---
This matches my Vanilla experience so well. I had no idea what I was doing and it was the most fun I've ever had. Only made it a few bosses through MC so I'm glad I'll be able to get the full experience this time around
---
Love it!  
---
I'd love to see a graphically simplified version that had flight time listed between nodes
---
hi its me your friend let me play
---
Of course you can do them all. You don't pick that spec to be viable in everything, not optimal. It's the only spec/class in the game that can do it, of course it can't be the strongest in any aspect or everyone would do it.
---
I don‚Äôt remember that, at all.
---
This is also looking good for an Alterac Valley test, which unlocks at level 51.
---
I haven't seen anything confirming it, but this would make sense. AV is the most technically complicated, and deserves thorough testing.
---
24% is the highest i have seen. half of those are because they think they can be teh best dps ever.
---
half of the remaing, plan to tank, half of that remaining will tank, half that will tank well, and 5% of that will be main tank
---
83 days 2 hours 55 minutes
---
Imagine thinking that causing annoyance with your choice of phrasing means that you've "got your point across".
---
Yeah you think streamers will hold off on ringing it for other people
---
You need the head to start the quest. The later you start it, the longer other people farm with it. They've also all got their guild that they can get to farm for them, adding a new person each turn in. 
---
In my guess, if you don't get the head week one or week two, you can consider yourself out. Furthermore, with increasing numbers on what appear to be higher max population servers means there is a point where your farming is effectively capped. 
---
After that step, you've got server bosses which are going to be in a lot of competition. The only saving grace is the 5 day waiting period at the end and hoping that the server takes their sweet time on the material donations. 
---
If both factions and all guilds cooperate well, you can probably see about 8 to 10 max. Since I don't imagine people will cooperate, and I imagine a more toxic event of people going out of their way to ensure others don't get it, probably 1-3 people. From everything people are saying about streamers and their fans, I expect 2 at most, but probably just 1 on whatever server they decide to congregate on.
---
Miss the part where I said they won't have a beta after launch? It's not a long comment. You can do better.
---
Northrend, the Broken Isles, Kul Tiran and Pandaria were all KNOWN to have existed before and during Vanilla and are ever references in some quests.
---
It's not like they just magically appeared.
---
To get down to NS in resto, you're probably gonna grab reflection.
---
They really going to keep increasing to level 60?
---
Kind of a bummer. Kills some hype if all these streamers will be playing all the content for 3 more months.
---
how very enlightening
---
In general I agree that it‚Äôs not even close, but inviting all the streamers to play, even people who don‚Äôt play wow, makes it feel like it‚Äôs probably 50/50
---
Doing my best to keep that in mind.  This is like elitist jerks 2.0.
---
There's a personal commitment AND guild commitment here. The quest chain is long, the rep grind is long, and it also involves BWL twice, Ony, MC, and an outdoor raid on Doctor Weavil. But hypothetically 40+ people could get it. But historically less than 5 did.     
---
I've never seen two different guilds get it. That isn't for mechanical reasons, but rather just practical ones, it has a 10 hour duration. If you were ready to ring the gong you're going to go ahead and do that in case you miss your shot.
---
&gt; where its just the current game with level cap decreased and some stuff disabled?
---
Exactly this.
---
For a true classic experience you have to play emu.
---
Downvoted. Get wrecked nerd.
---
Ah thank you!
---
Looking at extensive testing on the beta, weapon skill doesn't seem to be particularly effective at reducing dodge or parry at all. It looks like it is literally just the inverse of Defense, being 0.04 chance reduction to dodge/parry/block per skill point. It does still show effective benefits to reducing the chance for glancing blows.
---
It looks like just about everything we know about weapon skill from Private Servers is incredibly wrong. We also know from the blue post today about a hidden mechanic that +5 in a weapon skill increases your chance to hit by 1%, unless you have 9% hit or higher. That might be where the +hit was actually coming from, not weapon skill itself.
---
Have one too, but there are kind of hard to press tbh
---
Must test.
---
10/10 would send a war party to raid. FTH
---
me like this
---
I was referring to the assumed cap of 10.
---
I think venruki and ziqo are doing double aoe frost mage
---
Their physical location wasn‚Äôt known until they became places you could go. Basically pretending no one mapped them for no reason.
---
Really even the earlier raids have a higher time commitment with the attunements and such. I just don‚Äôt think Classic is more hardcore than retail in almost any way.
---
Oh? Well I have something new to test now! Lets see how many I can make.
---
Just the quick look I had at it gave me a headache.
---
https://youtu.be/BAibYnDUH6c
---
Burn that flag
---
Looks cool. But... if you're going to take a pic of your set-up. Just make it look unrealistically clean for like.. 2 seconds before you take it. All the clutter and mess takes away from how good it "could" look. 6/10
---
You could get an identical chest piece
---
Plus you didn't have to buy ammo anymore so it was worth it.
---
This is the best piece of vanilla fan art I have seen, when starting out a large boar or hostile wolf is dangerous as it should be.
---
I didn't read you would only do pvp because i saw LT in your template, so yeah rank2 is enought. And drop LT for range.
---
None of them really as i ran all those places into oblivion.
---
I am excited about all the raids thou and pvp.
---
Clean it up
---
I‚Äôm going to do my best to do this as a tauren. I hope I can find some big enough bushes.
---
&gt;	Druids are a close second to warriors in raids, and have a TPS advantage in early tiers
---
Lmfaooooo what are you smoking I said this shit hours ago and now you‚Äôve completely been pinned to this but without any qualifiers. Actually, you‚Äôre last remaining qualifier is ‚Äúclose second,‚Äù but at least you‚Äôve acknowledged the second part. This is hilarious. Go read your comments again and see how you‚Äôve slowly moved the goalposts. 
---
Anyway 80% of the video is him running through the Druids cons. That‚Äôs why the YouTube comments are laughing at how much longer the Druid ‚Äúcon‚Äù list is. Scathing. But just because you‚Äôve decided on a Druid doesn‚Äôt mean you need to feel threatened by Warriors‚Äô objectively superior tanking ability. 
---
My favorite part of the video was that even amongst the most hardcore speed running guilds that have amazing healers and DPS ‚Äî they **still** wont take Druids over Warriors for reasons that have nothing to do with Thunderfury.  
---
Btw, I never said Druids were incapable of tanking AQ or Naxx 
---
https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/1975034-thanks_for_playing_screen__mario_kart_double_dash___.png
---
damn it!
---
It is nice equipment but a bit messy.  7/10
---
Thats pretty neat
---
Lmao exactly what i thought after i took the pic, hey atleast its in its natural environment come launch day
---
Ah, true.
---
It's not dumb. Blizzard is most likely running logging on the server, recording all the duel values as well as other stuff. Plus they get to see tournament quality players testing the combat out for any errors. This is valuable data being captured.
---
Ain‚Äôt a thang. It‚Äôs all fair game. 
---
Best of luck to you as well! I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll cross paths again.
---
Yikes. Do people do a final read through of their posts before they hit enter?
---
Chromaggus drops 4 pieces of loot:
---
* 1 of 8 different T2 shoulders
---
* 1 other item from a second group
---
This gives at least one of your T2 shoulders a 23.4% chance of being on the boss.
---
The second group is:
---
* Angelista's Grasp
---
* Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting
---
* Chromatic Boots
---
* Chromatically Tempered Sword
---
* Claw of Chromaggus
---
* Elementium Reinforced Bulwark
---
* Elementium Threaded Cloak
---
* Empowered Leggings
---
* Girdle of the Fallen Crusader
---
* Primalist's Linked Waistguard
---
* Shimmering Geta
---
* Taut Dragonhide Gloves
---
* Taut Dragonhide Shoulderpads
---
This is 13 items and they all have a confirmed equal chance of dropping, meaning the chances of there being at least one Ashjre'thul on the boss is 7.5% (matches up with ClassicDB and Wowhead data)
---
It's probably going to be at least 4 months between BWL and AQ launch, plus another 2-3 weeks before the gates are open. That's about 20 Chromaggus kills before AQ.
---
Meaning the chance of seeing one Ashjre'thul is 79.17%.
---
The chance of seeing two is 62.68%
---
The chance of seeing three is 49.62%
---
The chance of seeing four is 39.29%
---
The chance of seeing five is 31.10%
---
You bring 3 hunters to every raid, it's basically a coin flip that they'll all have Ashjre'thul by the time AQ opens.
---
In comparison, assuming BWL doesn't launch for 5 months after MC, you have a 70.43% chance of having ONE Eye of Sulfuras drop for the raid by AQ (~40 clears).
---
When we got there it wasn't that the tank was falling asleep, he just had so much aggro he'd go take a shit and get food and still be okay on threat when he got back.
---
Path of Exile content drops on the 7th. Do that until then.
---
A lot of people who WANT to play warrior....will never reach 60
---
What does that mean?
---
I mean it comes out in 84 days and there is still a ton more to test imo. I'm honestly surprised the Beta started this late.
---
Never forget Intimidating Shout with no target cap in AV.
---
And dont forget that yoir raid frames must take 750x550 of your screen real estate.
---
For 2 hours? If you can't get off a game for only 2 hours once a week you need some serious professional help.
---
It's cleaner than my desk.
---
I feel the same way. It's crazy how so many people are freaking out about their lack of beta access.
---
I started playing the summer of 05 and haven't had a single lapse in my sub since then. Do you think I give a damn about beta? Nope.
---
Given the time of takes to level I'd rather not waste my time and energy getting to 30 (now 40) knowing my character will be wiped and I'll have to start all over.
---
I leveled several characters to 60 so I'm fine with waiting for Classic to hit. I honestly haven't even watched a single stream, it just doesn't interest me. I get a lot of people are excited and that's awesome. I'm glad to see this much excitement around Classic, but I don't see the need to get upset I myself haven't gotten a beta invite.
---
Apparently over 120,000 people since that‚Äôs how many people watched the tournament live on twitch.
---
Do you have insider access? I wouldn't be surprised if they did more closed beta for BWL/AQ40/Naxx testing.
---
I don‚Äôt get the few replies that are against my attitude, it‚Äôs an old game and it‚Äôll be great when it‚Äôs back, but it‚Äôs not back.
---
The constant flow of telling people how they should feel about something. Everyone has their own opinions.
---
Traditional cheating doesnt make blizzard any money unlike multiboxing. Its simple
---
People coming from private server are saying the first raids are easy and can be done with fresh 60's in greens.
---
But if you check out all the crap that private servers don't know guessed at you'll see that the there is tons about those raids that are wrong.
---
 Expect there to be dramatic differences between what private server are expecting and what we actually get.
---
It's not greedy, its free advertising and hype building. Any sensible business would do it. The salt is real.
---
See my memory has be remembering it happening in WSG specifically :S
---
Welcome to the [Wirt's Third Leg](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9359) meta!
---
There was some guy commenting on here a week ago getting pissy because he thought streamers were getting a head start, so yeah it's already happening.
---
I remember rolling a warrior because there was never enough tanks, never enough. It was my 3rd 60 and I got non stop groups as a bad tank using a spec that was honestly crappy for arms. I mean, if this really is "nochanges", that should repeat itself and oversaturation is impossible. Otherwise we need a classic^2 with even more "nochanges".
---
I still rage a little thinking about having our tank need on felstriker during a run. Wasn't a guild run, so I guess... ugh.
---
A question that involves classic should be asked somewhere else....  K.
---
I think it's probably worth it in the long run. Obviously if you never have tps issues then it's not a good idea to go for it. But downgrading gloves (edgemaster's handguards or aged core leather gloves) or belt (Mugger's Belt from DM:N) shouldn't be that much of a big deal. You can make up for the lost mitigation elsewhere in your gear, assuming you weren't in full mitigation already.
---
imagine acting like anything past vanilla is bad when the two best expansions came right after it.
---
Druid can farm lashers with barkskin + hurricane and bear + swipe to finish them off. Plus they can also do Mara, not as fast as hunter or warlock though. Plus as you said, good herbalists with stealth, hibernate and roots. Probably a 1/29/21 spec. 
---
Paladins I have no idea sorry. Probably a mix of consecration and a skullflame shield. 
---
Priests can do holy Nova farm with lashers.
---
Shamans (for other curious people in the thread) can also farm lashers with chain lightning, lightning shield, fire nova totem and being crit procs the pushback resistance, for more chain lightnings. Early on, you may need elemental mastery, which would mean no NS. Probably a 30/0/21 spec.
---
Also all these classes can duo farm stuff like dm:east with a warrior which is nice gold too! If these methods stay in for classic of course.
---
HAHAHA
---
I regularly make some pop stats of a french pserver : they have between 16 and 20% warriors, so if you ask me there are enough that reach lvl 60.
---
I plan on going Shaman, and I am going to try my hardest to BE the tank!
---
I'll be getting ElvUI which is a liteweight complilation of all the most useful addons, then whatever it doesn't cover. I don't believe it comes with boss mods, enemy CD tracker, stuff like that
---
I doubt it. Probably 40 till beginning of July. Then 50 till beginning of August. That gives them 3 weeks-ish to fix any bugs. I doubt they'll let people to 60. That kinda fucks with the hype, people will be raiding in beta, doesnt make sense.
---
You could have made this *exact* argument about classic itself.
---
You cast Shadowform. 
---
Hunter casts Bestial Wrath.
---
You lose.
---
Would look better with the full screenshot really
---
83 days. 14 hours. 02 minutes. 36 seconds.
---
That is when my world will end.
---
But I didn‚Äôt?
---
I'm currently playing on a i7 with HD630 graphics. Running on max settings just fine tbh
---
Couldn't you just not watch streamers?
---
You can never have too many solid and skilled warriors, alot of people create but never finish or quite get what it takes.
---
It's not the monitor, we have gamer eyes.
---
Ok.
---
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/free%20speech
---
You saying that assuming that when someone says free speech they aren‚Äôt referring to the freedom is nonsense. But it‚Äôs the definition in Merriam Webster and the commonly used context of the phrase.
---
Your username also suggests you aren‚Äôt someone interested in nuance or real discourse but rather someone interested in trolling and ‚Äúowning the libs‚Äù, so I‚Äôll let you call up Merriam Webster and tell them that they should change their definition to reflect that unless someone says the word ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù or ‚Äúconstitution‚Äù it is improper to assume free speech refers to the constitutional protection rather than a general principle of unpoliced discourse.
---
There is no way rogues stay that low in the polls
---
Doesn't intimidating shout have a cap of 5?
---
Would probably expect them to release some fixes with the (presumably) new patch that ups the level cap tbh - although youd think they'd release a 'fixes' post if they did this so who knows.
---
I'm going to use Questie, Recount, Healbot and DBM.
---
Anthem
---
I mean if they ever announce TBC youll have more than enough time to level a new character.
---
Whenever I listen to Metallicas And Justice for All album, all I can think about is farming fire giants or cutting willows on Runescape. Such a comfy feel.
---
This is is what I'm thinking, don't know why people are throwing pop caps of 9k and 15k around.
---
But anything is speculation at most and you know what they say about assumptions
---
BoE's you mean.
---
Well yes, maybe, I don't know. On pservers it's usually not been too bad to get. A couple hundred gold for each of them, most certainly easier than doing any kind of dungeon for loot.
---
/ra Sapped at farm by 2 rogues
---
If you want to DPS I don't think it will be a problem, I saw a YT video of a raid with 22 warriors ...
---
If you want to tank 5 man content I bet you will fin instant groups.
---
However if you want to tank in raids, I'm not optimistic. You'd better start your own guild.
---
I would do the same thing if I was them. It just makes sense.
---
You know it's a test phase, not early access right?
---
Gamer eyes don't get flashbanged.
---
hi its me your friend no
---
Well they blew it.
---
He didn't have access initially. He had to go through someone who knew someone who knew Joey Numbers at Blizzard to get him in. Just like Trainwrecks. And just like McConnell.
---
I'm not going to apply but here is my upvote. For the hor.. Wait.. Orcs!
---
Trade or mail people 5-50g then say/write  ''thank you for choosing to purchase from our site'' then log out and delete character.
---
Only did this to people with bad reps on private servers before I quit playing. Dont know if they got banned. Their reactons were hilarious though  :D Most of them went wait wtf no! NOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didnt buy anything!!!!
---
Nah warriors are going to dominate the PvP meta, at least in BGs. A lot of important stuff comes between 30-40, and it will be interesting to see the BiS plate gear that people obtain.
---
but at least alliance are again right next door to blackrock mountain
---
As Classic gets closer, it might be appropriate to incentivize the community to report comments or screenshots that are/have anachronisms using the reputation system for further pruning. Have the comments essentially been "forked" between the two sites and can be edited independently of each other or are the mirrored across both?
---
I'm a huge poster on [Wowhead from years past](https://www.wowhead.com/user=QuickBASIC37) (still in top 200 years later lol) and I look forward to helping update and maintain the information on the site as a part of the community, but I'm worried about the overlap from comments in retail Wow making the information confusing or hard to navigate.
---
Lmao the wrath helm got me
---
Source? Where have devs mentioned numbers for server caps?
---
Yeah, you guys get screwed by SM.  RFK and RFD aren't too bad and are accessible from Feralas pretty easily.  It's still a pain in the ass to get to Feralas though.  
---
I'd probably do SW to BB then ship to Ratchet and fly to Feralas.  I'd probably run from Ratchet if you had a 40% movement from travel form or something.  That might save time.  
---
Then again, Alliance get's the close FP to Blackrock Mountain which is a huge late game spot.  Alliance gets screwed on WPL/EPL flight paths though.  Everyone get's fucked for Silithus.  Idk, maybe horde does have it better.
---
Upvoted for the horde
---
Catajizzzzum - burn it please
---
Replace [REALM] in that link with the K word Private Server (AutoMod keeps removing my comments).
---
Mr. YouTuber/Twitch streamer is building hype and a community more than you ever will.
---
As in all vanilla servers were 3kish back in the day and im not shure there is one tbh. Just going off an assuption that theyll stick with vanilla. That would be a jurastic change to multiple facets of the gameplay
---
really? which CPU are you using? i have research almost everyone says that they use low presets like 3-4.
---
Consider this, if you don't have much time to invest like you used to. (I know I don't working 12 hour shifts and a 3 year old ontop of that)
---
Paladins CAN tank Vanilla 5-10 man's. You can gear yourself up and make a name for your character on your server just doing 5-10 man's at 60.
---
If you want to raid there's about 2% of the total raid content that you can be viable and useful tanking, other than that you are healing.
---
They mentioned the possibility of TBC servers but I believe they said it like "rolling over" and "progression" so I think what it would be is the current Classic servers would become TBC and maybe some new fresh Classic servers would replace them starting at Phase 1.
---
Either way, if you like Pally and want to tank, do it. I don't think the community this time around will be so offputted at a Pally tank in dungeons unless you actually are bad. Then when/if TBC comes out you're set.
---
I'd rather be a well known and popular 5-10 man Paladin tank than a Main Tank Warrior that barely has time to Raid or can't make every raid consistently and falls behind or becomes a off tank.
---
I voted for all of them.
---
Hogger
---
Aren't all mob packs a mix of melee and casters ?
---
The only distinct memories I have are the ogres in Deadwind : as a warrior the casters were super squishy but the melees were hitting hard !
---
mount vendors
---
The residents of Darnassus are looking forward to having a home again I'm sure.
---
What is this build meant to be for? You said you spent a lot of time "theorycrafting" it but forgot to tell us with what goals in mind.    
---
I'm guessing PvP? But you included Spirit Tap and didn't include Shadow Reach. If you plan on leveling while you PvP then Shadow Focus is valuable (since you're attacking mobs higher levels) and Shadow Reach is almost mandatory.
---
You could theoretically run through BRD to get in the back way. I believe 40 is the actually the minimum level required to enter BRD in vanilla. That being said I don‚Äôt know if the back entrance to MC has a minimum level requirement higher than BRD.
---
Hey Teeb here, go ahead!
---
Here‚Äôs the terrain maps being referred to btw for anyone wondering:
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1260
---
Engineering gives you a lot of versatility. It does help in pvp but also does it in handling multiple mobs, tanking, escaping from certain death by over pulling, can help to shorten travel time, etc. It adds up over time and is hell of a fun to level.
---
Hell yeah... Got like 30g and I don't have to buy my mount.
---
its hard to say several popular content creators play warrior and they could certainly sway war numbers. 
---
that said there will always be room for good players
---
if you enjoy war the most and will put in enough effort to dps or tank well you  should be alright.
---
though tanking for raids is a big responsibility if you want to MT , sure go mt but lol i want an unemployed virgin who lives with his mum and plays all day to be mt for whatever guild i join
---
I had a Devilsaur set made by &lt;Meatmachine&gt;. I fucking hated it. I would def pay a bit more for a cooler tag.
---
The problem is that you sent the opposite message. IF you re subbed once classic came out, that would tell them that's why you returned, instead you told them, "I am here for BFA".
---
EQ is P2W now. They have a cash shop with XP potions and shit.
---
Classic WoW should avoid being anything like the current iteration of EQ.
---
I would find it very funny if a server conspired to screw over their realm's streamers in secret.
---
Any RP guilds planned for release?
---
Amazing.
---
I'm just settling in Elwynn forest with my lvl 7 character, I guess I'll get the full STV experience.
---
but but he was in vanillaz
---
Ret doesn't just suck, my dude. It's hot garbage. We're talking probably more than half that of a Warrior or Rogue. Why would any semi-serious group want that? And to give loot away when it would be much better for a warrior?
---
I'm fine with whatever for dungeon groups, but any group that's going to raid consistently will suffer from a Ret paladin. It's not trying to be rude, it's just how classic is.
---
As a mostly 19 twink player in vanilla, Deadmines and Wailing Caverns will be most of my nostalgia. Despite some people hating them, Maraudon and Diremaul are some of my favorites as well. I like the really long ones, so BRD is amazing as too, though a lot of people actually like that one.
---
Would be helpful to see the combination of choices in the results. Like engineering starters may select mining, but skinners may select mining, and so might tailors, but herbalist may be low. But if there are a lot of herb/alc, etc, it may skew the results to indicate mining/herbalism combo, even if not many people are actually running that exact combo.
---
I have no idea what addons will be available but mainly just something to help me heal more efficiently.

Mounts and end of talent-tree abilities should be neat.

It's called limited access. The throngs do not have access to beta.

---
AoE grinding hasn't really changed since Vanilla. Just look up an old guide and apply non keyboard turning/clicking along with common sense...
---
Also, AoE grinding won't really work when zones are full so don't expect it to work at all on launch unless you're so far ahead the area is dead.
---
Imagine gearing up those 22 warriors in the same raid group, though.

Yeah, looks like they got chopped somehow when they uploaded. :(

In before streamers get lost in Uldaman for hours.
---
Warlocks don't benefit from expansive mind as much as mages do. However, it's still better than humans.  
---
Gnome Base Int is 24 + 2 Int for Picking a Warlock = 26 (Compared to Human Warlock's 22)
---
Best Gear for Warlock is roughly 201 Int.  Which means that 5% of 227 is 11.35 extra int from Expansive Mind.
---
Intellect only increases crit chance and mana amount, not spellpower.
---
Gnome Mana will be 3575 vs Human's 3345 (Max rank shadowbolt is 380 mana, so it won't afford an extra cast but might give you room for a curse)
---
Warlocks get 1% crit for every 60.6 Intellect.
---
Gnome Warlocks would have 3.93% crit vs Human's 3.68%
---
I find that the escape artist will be more helpful than perception because it is useful for both PVE and PVP as well as being useable against more classes.
---
I've heard that gnomes can have some line of sight problems due to their height, but summoning a doomguard feels more badass when you are only as tall as his kneecap.
---
Not during the early days.

Hey there, we're definitely looking for more members. We have a discord that people are starting to slowly join if you want to join us there. From there we have a spreadsheet we're keeping track of what people plan on playing along with some other guild related subjects.

He is asking for pre-60 then people answer pre-60
---
It's a beta. If the level cap was 60 the minmaxing would still be for nothing.
---
Thanks for the link, despite the ad hominems that was fascinating. Especially since one of the examples they use is about Shanghai which obviously doesn‚Äôt adhere to the 1st amendment cited in the definition. I‚Äôll let Webster know about it‚Äôs mistake later when I‚Äôm free.
---
I'm glad I popped on a P. Server, I've decided to play Alliance because I still have 90% of Horde quests memorized. Also it helped me choose my main (Warlock) and Alt (Warrior) over my Vanilla experience main (Mage) and Alt (Druid)              
---
                 
---
I just never level past 20, thats the rule. if I ding 20 I delete it no matter what, dont wana ruin the launch but I need something to occupy time.
---
When asked about TBC didn't they say that if they got to a point where they continued the progression it wouldn't be out of the possibility?
---
I think the point they are refering to is how stagnant it can get once a server has been on Naxx for a year straight. 
---
I think they would roll over/progress the current Classic servers into TBC and then create new Classic servers that start at Phase 1 to replace them.
---
Boy this reminds me of my first time healing in MC on my 58 druid.  My guild was missing players for Rag so I set my screen up similarly on the run in.  Never again
---
Haven't seen this post in a while.
---
How are you not melting your carpet under that pc?
---
You don't really do that much... solo farming stuff for gold in vanilla. It's not like you just go in the world and kill mobs that's usually very inefficient. You make gold with crafting professions, pickpocketing and if you are killing in the world it's usually the big contested things like fire or earth elementals that aren't hard to kill it's just about getting the tag and being there. 
---
But overall rogue is really weak at farming gold in their raiding spec. I would recommend doing respecs after a raid and farming a massive amount of gold before respeccing back and then not farming gold for a couple of weeks or something like that.
---
That guy will no doubt end up in one of my 5 mans. His pet will be on taunt and he will roll need on one of my priest items because it has int on it.
---
My plan is to get auto sell trash items, some nicer unit frames and deadly boss mods (or equivalent)  whisper cast for buffs, and maybe a couple more.   I plan to play as a dwarf priest and I've really not ever been a healer so I may try to find other mods to aid me.
---
If someone here has no idea what happened to firewall or what was firewall I suggest you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4zioTMHB_o) video from N.S.
---
I think we're using 1.12 talents and abilities and it had a cap at that point. It's a lower level ability so somebody with a beta key could just check.
---
This!  I would do the very same as I loved pally tanking in tbc, but I am horde so nope.
---
I will be rested leveling a drood though for tbc
---
I think when 60 is out id agree, but being at lower lvl means they have to find the correct money influx and correct opportunity costs. At 60 yeah absolutely when everyone has their entire kit make it free to test everything.
---
Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic. 
---
Straight from [wowhead](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow) . Do you just not read or do you look to stay ignorant so you can keep your pitchfork out?
---
[here‚Äôs the interview for their source](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo)
---
Seriously though, why are dwarves the least popular alliance race?
---
This is the way all of our heroes story begin. You got a shitty weapon, clothes on your back, maybe a single spell, and some rations of food and water. You claw and scrape your way to actually acquiring real armor and weapons. You learn the ways of magic and combat over time. All for the end game goal of being a single cog in the wheel of the world and the war for it. You aren't the savior of the world, you aren't a prophecy come to live. You are 1 soldier fighting in the war for the soul of azeroth.
---
eventually in classic there wont be enough content for you to be completely packed. at that point you can level a new character and still have more than enough time to do everything else.
---
You do dungeons for the gear and quests for the XP, it's not one versus the other.
---
'cuz he's saying what people want to hear.
---
so he is a bad person because he left blizzard and made a game?
---
honestly i respect that, most people would ride the gravy train as long as possible after being part of creating wow. 
---
He had a secure senior position in the wow team when it was the biggest game in the world and decided to take a chance making another game on his own, i have nothing but respect for that...
---
Then no.
---
That rig is about 7 years old now, waiting on some parts in the mail for a new build and i plan to set it to the left of my monitors.
---
But Int gives mana and spell crit. ü§î
---
3. You will not be capped at 30.
---
But you're not doing 1 hour of work, you're doing 1 minute of work and 59 minutes of whatever else you want to do.
---
Let me put it another way:
---
Per hour of skinning, you make 42.85g per hour.
---
Per hour of gameplay (with a 4d23.5h run), you make 1.25g per hour.
---
The purpose of the original analysis was to find out if tacking on skinning to a leveling run was worth it. In that question, the 42.85g number is relevant and the 1.25g number is not.
---
How much skinning makes you from 1 to 60 does not depend on how long it takes you to level to 60.
---
If it takes you 10 days played, that's 61s 35c per hour. This number doesn't fucking matter. You're not interested in how LONG it will take you to reach ~150g from skinning while you level, you're interested in the raw gold output of skinning.
---
Agreed completely. A few people here and on the official forums speak of him as if every word he utters should be etched in stone somewhere. [Here's](https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story) a nice summary piece on the guy. I implore folks to read the links provided there as well.
---
Why all the text, looks good otherwise
---
Can we please keep this bullshit out of here?
---
Keep trying, I‚Äôm enjoying your frustration :) No goalposts were moved, just counters to your silly hyperbole. Now that you‚Äôre mad you don‚Äôt want to lose face and admit the laundry list of bullshit you posted earlier is irrelevant. The sources I provide confirm everything I‚Äôve said. I never argued that bears are overall superior to warriors, just that the gap is slim and most of the ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù barely matter. And that‚Äôs true.  Both tanks survive fine, druids can tank almost everything a warrior can. 
---
Warriors have a slight edge during BWL/with TF. 
---
Druids are stronger in pre-raid BiS (see video). 
---
Most bears are taken as OTs, due to advantageous talents, but they can tank almost every encounter in vanilla as well or almost as well as a warrior. I provided video evidence of that. This counters the silly statement you made about bears having no place in endgame raiding in vanilla. 
---
At the end of it all, we don‚Äôt really disagree on much - but you‚Äôre too butthurt to admit that I connected you with useful information you didn‚Äôt have.
---
The best qol ever
---
Where there is a will, there is a way.
---
Everyone talks big and has big plans. Truth is most warriors won't make it out of STV. Good warriors will always be in high demand. Don't concern yourself with what "you think" everyone else is doing. If you want to be a tank, be a tank. Go out and do it.
---
One thing that really motivated me when I got started is, you gotta realize, there are already people much less competent in the positions you want. Just be confident and do your research. Vanilla tanking is 95% preparation and 5% tanking. Knowing the fights and showing up with the right gear and consumes will put you ahead of the average warrior. That's where the "infinite-skillcap" you hear people talk about, when it comes to vanilla wow's gameplay.
---
If you really care about tanking, I definitely do suggest going human/orc. That weapon skill is invaluable and you can take that from me, as someone who has spent the past year as  NE warrior with lots of both MT and OT experience. I felt like I was constantly compensating for the lack of hit and can't wait to do both a Human and Orc warrior this time around.
---
Mostly gratitude for being the one to 'offically' get Blizzard's attention onto the Nostalrius petition.
---
You're right about his mishandling of Firefall though. I've seen people suggest that if Classic was to go the OSRS route, having Mark Kern as lead would be a godsend. I disagree.
---
The only issue I see is that you're saying "Pubs" and all I can think of is why are you telling the pubs to do stuff that isn't serve you a pint?
---
PuG(roup) makes more sense! ;)
---
level 40 update?
---
Gamer eyes have subsets. You are thinking of FPS eyes, a lot of us have RPG or Strategy eyes. Much different.
---
i'm gonna use the same ones i've always used: a unit frame add-on 'cuz i hate the default frames, a cast bar add-on and a damage meter.
---
Vol'jin and Thrall are Throne Room Bros once again
---
Pablo would be a warlock if he was any class
---
I never knew about this, sounds amazing! Seems like something only dedicated people will get to experience though, which is a shame
---
I mean... he's also the one who set up the meeting with Mike Morhaime and delivered the signatures after Nostalrius shut down. He played a part in the journey that got us to where we're at right now, regardless of what might have happened in the past with Firefall.
---
Probably like 30 per server
---
You know. The FPS problems arent why you guys couldn't see wtf was going on in Vanilla.
---
It does indeed, but it's still WoW. Epic set quests, expansions, changes...trusting WoW's playerbase with votes... yea well, no thanks.
---
If there are enough people that want TBC, then let them have it. Classic should be here for these that don't, for these that don't want to feel like there is a time limit to "complete" it, and for these that know what's waiting for them.
---
Ofc, you can give everyone servers but this creates population issues. I mean, why start arguing again? A simple search in the toolbar will produce 10000000000000 threads like this. If people didn't even bother to search for this, then i highly doubt they even care for classic.
---
Ya that's a whole other thing I was thinking about. I want to Tank because it's all I ever have done in WoW, but I work too much and too random of hours with a kid on-top of that to be delusional enough to think I'm going to make every raid of a guilds schedule.
---
Maybe I'll roll Paladin and just make a name for myself crushing 5-10 man dungeons for my server, make some connections and hope someone takes pity on me and let's me tag along in MC, Ony and BWL for some healing gear and tanking scraps lol
---
I honestly doubt he had much at all to do with their final decision. It seemed more like he finally saw something he could latch onto for relevancy.
---
I don't think your crazy to think that. I know that if I had beta I wouldn't allow myself to play cause otherwise I would absolutely get burned out. Made that mistake during the Wrath beta and not going to do so again.
---
Oh my god, the mounts! How much do they cost in Classic?
---
Nah. Warriors are going to murder them now.
---
Blizzard is well aware their subs have increased lately. They keep tabs on this to the T.
---
Nobody will really know until post-launch.
---
This will be awesome. Seeing people farm for the mount and leveling professions because you can level from 225-300 at 40. Will be interesting to see how much is possible at 40!
---
I‚Äôm hyped and I never played Vanilla.
---
This is amazing.
---
I did level a dagger rogue in vanilla some 14 years ago, so I can confirm it can be done.  I would say it's a little slower time to kill but you move a little faster because of sub stealth speed buffs.  I remember having to bandage a lot too, otherwise you could stun lock as well
---
The only male human I would play is a priest. Nobody plays Male Nightelf Priest
---
Oh look another useless member of society.
---
This is awesome!
---
You should know though it says Aralhi instead of Arathi
---
Those are the ideal and tested combinations (Vanilla and private servers), You are correct ppl will take whatever healers are available but they will strive to the "ideal" because it simply is more efficient and easier to clear things. So give a choice between a third healer druid and a fourth or even fifth paladin / priest we know the outcome give all skills are gear are similar. 
---
OP was worried about a raid spot I simply outlined most likely outcome.
---
He helped amplify our voices by helping out with the Nostalrius petition, that was the role he played and why he gets +1's   
---
[Here's the video he made.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ix_Ir-HSWI)
---
Most people would agree that being better at progression is more important than being better at farm.
---
I was thinking about the ogres in deadwind specifically.
---
Also the green whelps in Swamp of Sorrows. (Favorite farm as a melee, great loot table)
---
This is posted here and wow forums probably 10 times per day.
---
False advertising!  Refund pls!
---
Yeah, I stopped at 26 as well. I have been playing around with a few other race/class combinations so I can be sure what I want to play in August.

Interesting, thanks :)

One of the best tips I saw regarding your last point is not only should you look out for great spirit staves (as they make excellent 2h weapons in vanilla since there is no damage penalty on them) but to build an entire spirit set. 
---
Set up hotkeys for gear sets (I think there is already an addon for making gear sets) and swap to spirit between pulls, and dps afterward. Hell, the math was done that leveling with spirit gear instead of dps gear actually ends up faster anyway because the significant gains on less downtime make up for losses in damage.
---
Say what you want about Cata, that's a cool ass box
---
oh piss off.
---
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
---
Also especially the lower level dungeons you wont find better gear upgrades outside the dungeon drops/quests. I do them for the quests and then again if i want to break up the questing boredom but "leveling" through just dungeons is very impractical in Vanilla, I think it was either TBC or Wrath where that became much easier to do.

Retail classic is going to be a major let down. It's going to be ruined by mainstream bs, trolls, children and just general lack of RP. Not to mention everyone and their dog knows how to play classic so it won't have that magic feeling of everything being challenging. Classic wow is about community and the retail players are aids. I've played wow almost all my life and recently, before the announcement of classic wow retail, I tried a vanilla ps and in just over the month I've been playing I've had the best experiences of WoW I've ever had. I've ran into the kindest of players. Everyone buffs each other. People give away loot to people in need instead of vendoring it. Strangers quest together. The world feels FILLED compared to the tragedy that is retail where you only run into other players in the main hubs. It's not going to be the same as you remember. And its going to be more competitive than for fun. It won't be genuine to the classic wow experience. But that's just my take. Oh yeah and it's $15/m. 
---
So he left a developer and tried to start his own thing and it failed, so what? Does that make him less qualified? Life is full of risks and failure unless you never attempt anything at all. He has valuable insight into Vanilla WoW that is worth listening to.
---
&gt; Is there a certain comment that stood out to you as immersion-breaking?
---
No, sorry, this was more of a general question. I noticed Patch ????? on every page and wasn't certain where the cutoff was, or if there was one.
---
the point that some people like to be competitive at things that many find easy to do is stupid? you must really hate speed runners then. 
---
Seems like anyone who accepts your point of view would be against speed running video games.
---
Awesome, simply awesome.
---
Human Rogue and Warrior are best in slot so why would you choose another race. When it comes to Priests dwarfs are just AMAZING in both PVP and PVE even shadowmeld for nightelfs is useful in PVP. When humnas have no edge.
---
Yeah, but by the time you can get the DM belt, you might have the gloves and Nightslayer Belt, so it's not great.
---
And by the time the dragon is up, you'll almost certainly have the gloves and likely have a Bloodfang Hood.
---
It's only the first +5 skill that gives such a boost.
---
Fuck.
---
It was fair when you made the choice to be on a PvP server. 
---
I don‚Äôt like it, so I am selecting PvE. Everyone knows the rules and consequences and made that call with full knowledge.
---
incredible
---
90g if exalted
---
The WC shoulders are better for anyone other than priests. More int and Stam rather than spirit.
---
They really dont make games that feel grindy and rewarding anymore. Todays games are instant gradification and not actually that social anymore.  
---
Sure there is some nostaliga in it, but thats because we know how good it was.
---
no additional weaponskill
---
Parry: 13.86% ¬±1.02% (633) 
---
+2
---
Parry: 12.17% ¬±1.89% (146)
---
+5
---
Parry: 13.41% ¬±1.07% (545)
---
i feel something is wildy wrong with +2 and or +5 as the +% weapon skill its saying it can be anywhere from 14.48 to 12.34. and it cant be over 14%
---
if its 0.04 per level like you said then +2 is wildy off as well. This leads me to believe that parry takes a greater reduction per weaponskill than dodge
---
Also looking at in game clues, Kelthuzad drops a weapon with just stam and +7 weapon skill, if this wasnt that important why would it be such a hard reward to come by?
---
I also never used pservers to gather any of my opinions on parry and weaponskill
---
the paladin sets should be pretty easy to get
---
you will get sick of the 5mans though , i would pick something you enjoy .
---
not sure what to reccomend , maybe go a damage spec if you are going to be more casual , id avoid ret though .  war damage ? then you can still tank dungeons whenever , once the main/offtank have their gear it should be up for other warriors
---
Too confusing to new players

Macro and keybind:

I just love everything ud related lol

Who cares
---
Did you check to see if the thieves tools that you sold were still in the 'buy back' tab?
---
100g with usual rep milestone
---
no one here knows anything about TBC
---
I don‚Äôt think I could handle two weeks straight without suffering physical damage at my age.....ugh I wish I could.
---
never said anything after vanilla was bad or good
---
just money generation
---
Skinning and mining is what i did before, and ill do it again all these years later.
---
Everything is harder to get done and, in general, you can't get much of it done on your own.
---
Classes are very limited by their roles - this lack of homogenization makes content feel very different when you do it with different party makeups.
---
Sometimes you bump into events that demand a role only one class can fulfill - nobody is riding through AQ40 or Naxx without being challenged to contribute to the team. The weakest link doesn't just get stuck in right field all day - they're gonna have to pitch and hit sometimes.
---
110 gold for mount and training. Expect a lot of world pvp as players compete to grind out the cash and resources. I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens!
---
No way. I have saw enough of beautified battlestations/setups. I rather see them in their normal glory.
---
you've got a golden ticket
---
Not Really true. Certainly true for some races like nelf, tauren and such but c'mon. The dwarf and orc models are fucking amazing
---
Telling a druid to worry about raid spots is misleading unless they are going for a server first progression guild.
---
But even your logic isn't sound. It makes more sense to bring the druid to MC/Ony/BWL because you'll clear stuff faster if your raid is geared, and having an imbalanced roster means you get a couple well-geared druids and a lot of other undergeared healers who will end up healing less.
---
Innervates, brez, offtanks, decursers are also valuable for 95% of guilds that won't need to min/max
---
Going at this rate asmon will be clearing rag before you guys even get to play the game lmao

What was the insider info about cancelled stuff?  What was cancelled?

Did you actually farm R14 ? You can actually take a break of your Ironfoe farm, it won't affect your chances to get it, R14 on the other hand ...

Obviously that will be Stitches as he devours the unwary.

"In three hours I'll only have 5 hours left!"
---
the person you are replying to
---
I agree completely. Spot on.
---
Except....Orcs are awesome and that 1h axe of Nefarian is amazing if you can land it but I always prefered a Troll tank. Better threat generation than any of the other horde races and when you start actively pushing the hardest fights in the game that's your top priority so that your DPS can go harder.
---
I agree though, I played a NE Warrior and regretted it later on as I was always worried about my hit vs my other warrior friends playing Humans, if you can ensure you're going to get good axes a the time then def orc, but I have a soft spot for "Sword and Board"

Scholomance and reserving runes and flask recipe! :D

I probably won't be doing any professions at all until mid-50s where I basically stop questing and start farming dungeons, leveling professions etc.

I'll slowly inch my way to 60 from all the things there are to do at the near-max levels rather than grind and quest.

well first mark kern is the entire reason wow exists in the first place. blizzard was going to discontinue creating wow but mark convinced them to keep developing it, so we have him to thank for everything wow related. also he represented the community for petitioning classic wow as he hand delivered hundreds of thousands of signatures straight to mike morhaime himself. he might not have the best track record with his own games, but you cant say what hes done for us should be disregarded because of that. the dude is a legend when it comes to wow.
---
I dunno, he listed tons of stuff. Originally when you died you would go to the Emerald Dream, etc. No idea if it's all true or not. Watch his streams if you want to see it all.
---
For leveling I'll use a quest addon, a swing timer, and an energy timer (if I end up going rogue). At max I try to keep it light so I'll use a threat meter and a boss mod, maybe some updated ui.
---
Gay bowser?

They are not easily killed no. For that I would definitely recommend at least equipping swords, you don't neccesarily have to be sword specced.

  And ofcourse!

The issue is, you've phrased it in the post as:
---
&gt;Having 305 weapon skill increases chance to hit by 1.2%
---
Which isn't correct. Having 305 (which is +5) weapon skill increases hit by 2% against level 63 enemies, and increases hit by .5% against other enemies.
---
Yes, going from 304 to 305 weapon skill adds 1.2%, but *having* 305 doesn't add 1.2%, it adds 2%.

Most likely a mistake like last time, I see them too

Human every time...NE's don't get increased agility....
---
I cant believe how stupid people can be sometimes, but well, here we are on internet all equal
---
 It's one of the reasons I don't want to play the beta - it's wasted time. Whole reason I dropped what little I had on P servers after the announcement.
---
This is the dumbest thing I've ever read. Did Kern tell you that?
---
ik you dont mean today specifically, but today i was met with more exmaples of how pservers did someting therefore its right then ever before....

Why does everyone in this community hate each other and assume the worst of everyone else now? Is it just a function of the sub‚Äôs population growing larger?

100g. You could get them down to roughly 80g if you were honored with your faction and got rank 3 in pvp

Ah I still hope they flesh out Mount Hyjal in the future. There's so much stuff they never got a chance to do because TBC took priority.

Remember to double paladins %because only alliance can be one.

I guess I thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm signed up for WoW Beta, I won‚Äôt need to add another for classic‚Äù really I didn‚Äôt think at all and it‚Äôs totally on me. 
---
Fingers crossed extra hard now! 
---
:P
---
This is pretty gay
---
What is your favorite at The moment? :)
---
Not necessarily. You can reserve 40-60 content for internal testing team, and extrapolate the observed behavior of players so far to adjust numbers properly.
---
My boy Marshal McBride, a respected lvl 20 npc who spent his career training young lvl 1 players
---
People need to utilize alts and they will have double the amount they need by 40.
---
Yep that's a good solution
---
Well said. I started WOW near the end of Vanilla and hit 60 a month before TBC. I was playing a hunter at the time because i thought "wow pets are cool!"..but after watching my friend play druid in TBC I immediately switched. I've played druid since TBC. It's fun as hell and its very VERY unique. OP is right..you will heal a lot. If you have never healed, please give it a shot! When I first started playing wow I never imagined myself being a healer. But a few years later and I was obsessed and surprisingly really good at it. I played priest and shaman as well. 
---
Going into season 8 during WOTLK I mained resto sham because they were really REALLY good. I sat global r1 in 3v3 all of s8. Razzlin-Magtheridon.
---
After s8 I went right back to druid. There's just something fluid about the class and switching forms. &lt;3 
---
As much as I have been wanting to roll melee DPS (war or rogue) for Classic..this post right here has helped me decide to go with druid. I'm so excited. Thanks!
---
What‚Äôs more likely for a lvl 40 tourney?
---
Tell people not to back pedal, but unbinding the key is stupid. You need it to line up jumps n shit carefully.
---
I agree. This post is garbage.
---
I feel like we're in the minority here unfortunately. He didn't rape anybody or commit murder, why really give a shit? A lot of people are just making fun of tips like this guy, but a few are trying to ban this monotone from the internet over daddies company.
---
How much time and effort do you need to collect such amount? In retail I have just completed a quest that rewards 16 gold, but I assume it is harder in Classic.
---
Being lazy bums about it id imagine
---
Yes and no they are good aoe tanks, but some off tank occasions need a taunt
---
does anyone know how we will be importing mods? would it still be curse?
---
april 05 still nothing :(
---
I need money, and a social life, and a new boat....
---
well I dont really need the boat....
---
but id really like one

So... we‚Äôre just doing a full 180 back to wanting retail and dual spec again already?

Everyone state if they are EU or NA please

So not only OP forgot to mention some of the more "questionable" aspects of Everquest but now we also have This + OSRS approach...

No wonder BFA suck, blizzard tried to make all of these happy.

/sigh.
---
You must feel relieved that bigotry isn't a mental illness. It's still a sign of being a garbage person, so guess you have that going for you.
---
I'll take a Horde version, thank you very much.
---
Those weapons shouldn't be out before naxx and it probably won't be. We don't fully know exactly how it'll work since blizzards posts are a bit vague. 
---
Rank12 is sick for shaman tho.
---
im not a fan of tips but i fail to see wtf his dads company has to do with his wow content ..
---
he plays games and makes content , people enjoy his content so im glad he makes it for them , his dad/family company or whatever has nothing to do with his content
---
wonder how he made someone so salty lul
---
right right, thanks!
---
yeah me too
---
Uhm....source? I'm looking at racials right now...
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with World of Warcraft.
---
Zenyatta's kit allows him to toss a HoT on a teammate and then focus 90% of attention on DPS while only retaining 10% attention for healing to move the HoT from one player to another.
---
There are no classes like this in WoW. There are no healer roles that will allow you to pay such little attention to healing in order to allow you to DPS.
---
Probably still curse or just the old fashioned way.
---
Doesn't one drop an agi enchant?
---
The head of the action house services is going to be so rich from the AH cut
---
To me none of the classes really feel right until lvl 40. That's when you get your 31 point talent. Which is the main reason they changed up the talent system eventually. Everything until 40 just feels gimped. 1 - 10 is tough for most classes, which I always found odd. New players will struggle a bit. You are basically just auto attacking things and 2 of anything will basically kill you!
---
If I were to guess, Zul'Farrak? Not sure tbh
---
yeeeees, me many years ago... i lived alone, no gf, no mum, no job, just some school a few hours a week and playing much wow i want!
---
I got shit from my parents for not wanting to go hang out with my friends some weekends, when all they did was smoke weed and drink illegally but of course I couldn't rat them out.  I'm sure they would actually be quite grateful I enjoyed WoW enough to say no to doing illegal stuff with my friends and instead got addicted to Warcrack.
---
i love DoaG! I had no idea he did Firefall. Will def watch when I get home, thanks for this
---
I vomited on my own dick
---
Alduin. And I'm sure Varian would rather be a prisoner than disenchanted.
---
&gt; Sounds crazy but my best and only English teacher was WOW... It was our motivation to learn and enjoy the game we LOVED that made us, somehow, unexplainably, learn a language from the scratch.
---
I can relate to this so much, Wow is what really made my english skyrocket cause I had to find a way to communicate with others and understand what was going on.
---
If you're not using addons you are going to be at a severe disadvantage when pvping or raiding. I'm going to be using several important add ons
---
Yeah, that looks like a healers UI, raid frames are all that matter.
---
Not a troll post - I'm having the hardest time explaining it in a way that would actually excite them. And they're MMO fans.
---
What part are you doubting?
---
I remember doing a UBRS run at like 1:30 am and the group took a 5 minute bathroom break. I woke up like 3 hours later on the toilet so confused and having no idea what happened.
---
I guess I could've phrased that better, sure.
---
Damn that looks so smooth! I hope you've used the last version I've uploaded, because of the spelling mistakes :D
---
I am very sorry that I offended you
---
NA, April 2006, I see beta servers but they're offline. Pretty sure this happened before and it was a glitch.
---
Let me in!!!
---
Do whatever you want
---
I'm pretty split. On one hand this is a pretty big scandal for a WoW Classic content creator and I don't think the truth should be censored.  
---
On the other hand, this post breaks (at least) rules 3 and 5, and so it should be removed.  
---
[D:](https://i.imgflip.com/1g8my4.jpg)
---
+/- is calculated via statistics formulas and the formula doesn't know the actual boundaries of the numbers. That number is the error range for 95 percent confidence intervals.
---
So they know the actual number falls between -x and +x, and we know as humans that there is a limit on that. So we know it probably skews closer to -x.
---
This seems to be a bug with patch display in general, we're looking into it!
---
Literally unplayable.
---
They will have mails finally and Stormstrike. I think they will oneshot casters if they are given even just one hit.
---
mark played a decent role into having classic become realized. i think that's why he's respected by the classic community. he's definitely not a god. i mean did you see how many trees he killed to get all those signatures printed on paper?
---
Did you update them again in the past hour?
---
Just showed up on my realm list, most likely a mistake tho. EU account from 2008.
---
Look at the ears of the female orc. Look at the running animation. That's not staying true tbh.
---
I ran the 100 man ventrilo server for vehement! NE hunter Kurzen.
---
I just enjoy getting things done in the game and I will play it a lot. Leveling quickly is a natural consequence of that.
---
And your argument from what I understand is that it needs to be tested now because they have the players and time, something that they won't have later is a flawed argument. Classic is less than 3 months away and the level cap is only now being raised to 40 on the Beta. They will likely have 5-6 months to test BG's between the release of classic and Phase 3 which is when WSG/AV are released. If anything they should be testing the BG's if the level cap ever gets to 60 in Beta, that way they have everything that's suppose to be fleshed out with the launch, cleaned up and finished. AB also isn't even coming out until Phase 4, AQ40 patch. Who knows though, maybe they literally have nothing to fix and are completely confident that 40-60 content won't require much time to fix prior to classic launch, though if that is true they would have set the release date sooner.
---
0 cause alliance
---
Wait, Orcs are aliens?
---
Wait wait wait....Everquest has continued to release content over all these years???
---
Fantastic, I'll give it a shot as soon as the servers are back up. Thank you for your work!
---
That's why I'd been confused, at least - I understood once you posted the breakdown here what you'd been thinking.
---
Could be an issue if someone thinks they need 7% hit for hit cap instead of 6%, because "305 weaponskill gives 1.2%". Otherwise, it's a great post explaining why people need to care about this!
---
Innervate is amazing on priests, Brez is great but it was only used for key people, Decurse the 5 mages can do the job as well. I totally agree with you not everyone will min/max BUT give a choice a raid would prefer the "ideal" combination. And even geared druids were bad healers, no reliable AOE heal, and paladins destroyed everyone on single target heals. So druids were more of utility. 
---
Again I am answering OP question in regards to a raid spot. Yes there are less druids on the servers bud you only need one anything past that was a bit of a disadvantage. Priests and Paladins you MUST have at least 3-4 of each for blessings and AOE heals. 
---
I Agree with the gear comment, no competition would help you get geared faster, but even with gear still lacking single target power and no AOE healing.
---

It says so in my Bradygames Battle Chest Guide book, and in the Game Manual and in the Bradygames Official Strategy Guide - "Master Guide Second Edition Strartegy Guide".

But if you give me some time I'll be sure to find some online sources as well :)

Cos they want to raid, etc

needs to be more organized (clean up bruh), and cable management. if you did that, solid 9/10

It sounds a bit elitist, but hunters through wrath basically have to have their pets on passive. You have to manually control your pet with ctrl1 and ctrl2. The pet ai sucks and you just have to get used to doing it yourself. You can also macro in start and stop pet attack commands but essentially manual is the best option. They will also break your traps if you dont have a macro.
---
This is mostly a glich, sorry guys. Some people kept the Stress-Test by a Bug, it was suposed to get removed, since you require a new Invite every Stress Test (1&amp;2 Test was 1 and 1,5) for Stress-Test 2 you will require a new Invite. This was confirmed by German CM in Twitch Chat.  
---
If Invites go out, then prob. 6 PM as usual.

---
My soul and my hole. Mmm give it to me Daddy Classic.
---
Definitely agree on this.  
---
I was a rogue who was going all out to push myself, and was the "rogue leader" for our guild. One of our rogues constantly was putting out like 25th on the meters, dying, and disconnecting at about the 3 hour mark. He just didn't "get" using poisons or sharpening stones in MC, and really didn't bother with a ton of advice that would improve himself.  
---
Our guild ended up killing rag our first time with only 26 people in the raid. That to me showed how much could be done, and how much dead weight we had.
---
there is no way people clear brd at lvl 40
---
&gt; They will have mails finally and Stormstrike. 
---
You're mentioning these things, as if the other classes don't get anything at all.
---
&gt; I think they will oneshot casters if they are given even just one hit. 
---
I don't think so. WF doesn't work like that, it doesn't have a 100% proc chance and even then, you have to get some lucky crits on top of that. 
---
Again. There's a reason why they're considered subpar to decent at best at 60.
---
"familys" company, Tips himself was part of it, while living in a house worth millions? begging for money on patreon?
---
2H fury does more damage in early raids due to the hit cap being lower 2 hander damage being better than 1 handers of the same level. Once you get to late-BWL &gt; AQ40 gear (and the AQ20 heroic strike manual) with higher +hit and weapon skill, dual wield starts to outshine 2hand.  2hand is still viable in end-game raiding, but if your goal is to be king of the DPS charts your guild will want you to go dual wield.  
---
However the most important role you can play in a guild - be a bro, bring consumables, and show up on time. You do these 3 things and you will get raid spots. Drama kills guilds - so don't start nothin' won't be nothin'.
---
[Stormstrike](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=17364/stormstrike) isn't on his bar.
---
No problem! It was an interesting challenge because neither addon I referenced was really useful as far as code goes.
---
Everyone was pretty much done gearing out their lvl 30 and dueling all day.
---
Much harder. It was pretty common for level 40 characters being unable to afford their first mount.
---
That was a very roundabout way for you to tell us that you:
---
1. Played on a private server
---
2. Did not play Vanilla
---
Yea on /r/getmotivated you'll hear abut failure as a shrine to perfection.

---
There is no mystery about leveling either.  I want to raid.  That happens at 60.
---
Mining &amp; skinning.
---
Pick up engineering at 60.

Would be awesome if the bot would use TTS for the Countdown
---
My regards.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say a solid half or more of this are going to quit well before 60.
---
Yep!
---
A similar quest in classic would reward less than 10 times that
---
Honestly, I am almost entirely referring to the Male models, mb. Anyway, female nelf, Male orc, Male dwarf, female human and probably more does just look downright better. Especially Male dwarf and orc. Dwarf went from looking like absolute shit to looking like the dwarf in the og vanilla cinematic. That said, some of the new ones are awful, nelf Male in particular.
---
Texture and model replacement was possible back in vanilla, but also ban-able.
---
let me in bitch
---
Take all the time you need.  I'll be here when you realize you were thinking of increased dodge, not agility.
---
post in trade chat
---
Hi, /u/rustybandit
---
I think warriors will have the most amount of re-rolls out of all the classes. I would imagine only a small percentage of those saying they are rolling warrior will make it to 60.
---
Because I want to start getting bis dungeon/quest gear so I can tank for raids plus I need to level fishing and cooking and I need to start making gold.
---
Nope, it says that the latest one was created 5 hours ago :D
---
Yes it's a real thing, was it done in vanilla no because it wasn't necessary and the spec relies heavily on the very late changes to warrior talents, will 14% parry kill it no but it does make it more risky to do due to parryhaste but on the other hand it will potentially be even more necessary to do as threat becomes a bigger issue with the high parry rate.
---
It's not as simple as that. Firefall failed partly due to Kern's mismanagement and berating of people. He was a terrible boss.
---
Yeah they were being a bit complacent, true. But really, nobody knew when or if they were going to raise the level cap. 
---
I guess that just makes Tips's tournament that much more special. I can't imagine a world where a completely maxed level 30 tournament will ever take place again.
---
Lol imagine using twitch chat as a source of info
---
This game is actually really fun.
---
Did you know there's a second and third game aswell? They're equally good if not better. Just google Murloc RPG 2 or 3
---
Fury tanking was definitely a thing.    
---
But typically when you **out-geared** the content. You cannot fury tank as MT on progression content because the content is better than your gear is. But if you have raid gear and want to do a 5 man or similar? Go for it, the run will be faster and threat better.      
---
I've seen people fury tank or put on DPS gear as Prot in everything below BWL/Naxx/AQ40. But if the tank was Naxx geared you could likely do most of BWL as Fury or with some DPS gear too. Keep in mind that when I say "Fury" tank I mean Fury talents, but with a shield equip.
---
That awkward moment you realize that when biologists see male animals butt-fucking other males they attribute 3 reasons:

That actions doesn't produce life. By definition its "retarded".

My favorite are when people say: ‚ÄúMark Kern think blizzard should do this with classic.‚Äù 
---
Mark Kern ran his own game company into the ground I don‚Äôt really care what he thinks blizzard should do as far as classic‚Äôs direction.
---
2 questions:
---
Were you in the stress test?
---
Do you have a blizz friend that you know put you on their F&amp;F list?
---
Okay sorry, well from what you are saying, they might and probably will like it, but they are very skeptic. I think to persuade them, you just need to make them pay for 1 month subscription to simply try it out once it out. WoW will lure them naturally
---
It is really amusing to overlevel and overgear the masses in vanilla wow, then go raidboss style in ashenvale redridge shimmering flats Tanaris etc.
---
thanks my man
---
It requires the attunement doesn't it?
---
I just feel bad for the paladins buffing back in the day, I played resto shaman and all I used was decurse lol
---
itt: guy with beta tells people without beta that it's not that bad to not have beta
---
wait why would this make any sense at all?
---
Busting out that good good when classic comes out.
---
It will show up on the battle net launcher in the same drop down menu as retail / PTR.  If it's not there, you're not in.
---
I fucking hate the new Orc Models and especially ALL of the animations. They look so cartoonish and rubbery when moving and casting.
---
Otherwise, I mostly agree. Nelf Male is ATROCIOUS in retail. Absolutely wrecked.
---
If it‚Äôs not there, you can‚Äôt use it. Turn the mouse and strafe works just fine for positioning.
---
I agree except I really do like the high detail in the dwarven beards with the remodels.
---
Double-posting in case you already read my earlier one:
---
I started working on a stitch myself a couple of months back, but dropped it after I realised how much work it is. Here's where I got to https://i.imgur.com/KhEQTCF.jpg.
---
I started by upscaling all the maps using waifu2x (a neural network image upscaling tool for cartoon art, more specifically anime but it works alright for this too). The result was far from outstanding, as you can see in the weird shoreline and such in the underlying main Kalimdor map, but it was better than traditional scaling algorithms.
---
I then took the base Kalimdor map, the one you see when zoomed out at the world map, and started laying zones on top of it using Photoshop smart objects and masking layers. I soon realised I would have to at least partially redraw:
---
- All the zone edges, to make roads connect properly and get rid of ugly seams between the mountains
---
- All the town/location name labels, to keep them a consistent size
---
- Every spot where the base Kalimdor map peeks out from behind the zone maps, because they're of grossly different scales (look at the horizontal lines in the water, for instance -- I wanted to keep those in because they're a very iconic feature of WoW maps, but they have to be of a consistent size)
---
- Certain features of the zonemaps because they're of different scales too. Look at Durotar and Barrens, for instance: the Barrens map is like twice the scale of Durotar, so the roads are wider, the shoreline... lines are wider, etc.
---
So I quit working on it. I *could* probably have done it if I really wanted to, but I'm just too bad at digital art so the process would have been very slow and arduous. I couldn't even figure out how to approximately replicate the brush Blizzard used for road edges in order to redraw the roads in Barrens.
---
If you want to pick up where I left off, I can upload the upscaled assets I used along with the PSD of my progress (in case you want to use that), though they're really big (on the order of 2 GB all in all), and they're using TBC maps because I wanted Quel'thalas to be a part of the maps (it's canon, I tell you!). Or I can instruct you in how I upscaled them in the first place, Waifu2x isn't too complicated to use.
---
*subs for classic invite*
---
*spends time complaining about retail in retail lfg*
---
Ahh - photobucket. Now that's something I haven't heard of in a while.
---
I know all the raiding ones from my old days but what are some examples of adventegous PvP add one if I may ask?
---
I plan on PvPing a lot as I used to but never used add ons aside from my own swing timer.
---
At level 40 especially.
---
Quest gold used to scale with the player level. I think level 60 quests would give like 1.5g for quite a few of them IIRC.
---
Aye the standard of streamer for classic wow is sadly very low. We do have some okey ones, and a few decent tho. Venruki is genuine, actually skilled and knowledgeable, and does not bite into the dumb twitch culture (an example would be when he won a duel against Payo, his chat linked him to a vod of Payo rage quitting, and he was merely meh what am i supposed to see about it.)
---
I have no played in years. Honestly if I log in and just want to get lvl 60 and no even read the quest lines then I will just pay s website a few hundred to power level me while I'm at work
---
everyone looks at warriors with r14 wrecking in pvp and say "heh i want to do that" without realizing that warriors suck 99% of the time before that
---
Not really
---
&gt; Here's a nice summary piece on the guy. I implore folks to read the links provided there as well.
---
Id rather see actual reasons what he is saying about Classic that you guys think is wrong. Not completely irrelevant stuff about another company and game. Or at least try to tell me how things like how much money he blew marketing a different game has jack shit to do with his thoughts on Classic.
---
&gt; You heal yourself  
---
Good ole pots and bandages. None of this "every class has a heal" stuff.
---
Old scholomance was soo good
---
Idk what is more important, a character you love how it looks like and enjoy playing it  
---
Or playing a character (human) just for rawr stats and dont like it at all?  
---
Still cant rly decide about that one, but maybe i get a final answer how much better humans are compared to all other races as Tanks only. if its like 1-2%, fuck it. if its like 10% i rly might consider it
---
Sure there's so inconsistencies, but at the end of the day, it's a solved game and you are not competing for World first anything. I'd much rather the game come out in a better state, then keep my 'hype' levels up like a child
---
Classic wow is actually a good game. 
---
They made classic wow before microtransactions became a thing so when they made classic it was all about good content. 
---
For anyone who has never played vanilla you are in for a treat.
---
I knew it when I just hit 30 smh lmao. Well now I can catch up I guess
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it wouldn‚Äôt have happened otherwise. It‚Äôs not like blizzard doesn‚Äôt have a PR team that looks out for stuff like that.
---
So yeah maybe he was instrumental, or maybe he was using the petition for his own personal gain.
---
Fastest way:
---
1: Check if you have friends or family working at blizzard
---
2: If not, you're not in the beta.
---
3: Repeat step 1.
---
Shadow form and frost barrier meta
---
Low effort, really?? I couldn't tell the difference between this and an actual screenshot! Well done my man, here have a downvote.
---
Log in.  Try to create a blood elf character.  If successful, you are not in the beta.
---
We are the allied atheist alliance!
---
Fury tanking raids was pretty unusual because people just weren't that concerned in Vanilla in doing speedruns or setting top DPS parses. 99% of guilds focused on clearing the content and then taking it relatively easy on farm content. This meta of trying to clear the entire raid in 43 minutes stacking every buff under the sun is purely a private server thing.  
---
For dungeon tanking on the other hand fury tanking was very normal, if your tank and healers were geared for it. If the tank is the highest level in the group, like lvl 45 doing Cathedral, or lvl 52 doing Zul'Farrak, they'd usually be in fury stance with a 2h'er or dual wield just blasting everything down.  
---
Similarly at lvl 60 it'd be common to get a BWL+ geared fury warrior to come tank a UBRS or Strat run for you and just do the whole thing in their fury set doing 60% of the group's damage. It made for very fast easy runs.
---
Not a problem for me, I can develop in LUA. 
---
ElvUI allows things to be custom, and reduced. 
---
My ui is very minimal and works with with my naga mouse.
---
Yep my bad.  Forgot the different races have different starting stats.
---
The +5 agility is pretty insignificant.  You'd get way more out of the +sword skill humans get.  I'm pretty sure it changes what some of your BiS at 60.  But I suppose if you assume daggers and exact same gear then NE would be 5 agility better.
---
Still though gimmie perception and diplimocy over 5 agility and showdowmeld
---
The Quest to get the staff was so good
---
Stays very true to original but simply higher resolution.   
---
I see nothing wrong here tbh. 
---
The revamped WOD models are shit as are the animations. They are shit because most of them do not look like the originals at all, and many races have very little variation too.
---
I do it to make people mad who are overly concerned with what other people are doing.
---
Do ‚Äúprot‚Äù warriors take SS?
---
Not subbed, and my served is dead
---
You heard it here folks. If you are terrrible at running a company, that means all your points forever and always about a different game they were a developer for are null and void.
---
Each individual person type is their own problem or their own blessing. Trying to quantify this in an objective way is quite simply the most irrelevantly pointless thing I can think of.
---
Tirion to chill in his little house.
---
I had a troll hunter with a rare lion pet named snuggles. Got to about level 50ish and found another troll hunter with my EXACT troll model AND rare lion pet named snuggles! We had never met before and I asked if he saw me earlier and emulated the exact looks and pet. Apparently he didn't but we both got a good laugh out of it.
---
So why didnt you check your launcher every minute ?
---
k then you have to unlearn the silly notion of a dead server
---
And the ‚Äúcasting animations will remain the same‚Äù yet they completely fucking changed Ud male animations
---
Mark Kern is fine as a developer. He's terrible as a leader. I'm just saying he should not be the one anyone listens to when it comes to design direction of WoW Classic.
---
Higher level = more fun in WPvP    (the only reason I am playing)
---
The question is. On the streamer servers that attact massive amounts of people. There very well might be 6000+ people on said server. So if blizzard doesnt plan on keeping layering in what should they do now with a server that is vastly larger than their original intent ? Server transfers ? Ques, combination if both ?
---
Love the blood quest boss you can summon
---
Sounds really unlikely!
---
Because there's always people in every group who desperately need to make drama when none exists to satisfy their sad life. Especially when it comes to video games.
---
Wasn't dead 12 years ago when I joined it :(
---
That sounds good!
---
I would like to play more traditional protection.
---
Not sure why the private server guys feel the need to push it. I guess it‚Äôs the meta police.
---
Hunter hunter hunter
---
If you're doing this, you may want to consider just biting the bullet and running from ratchet to xroads and getting that FP as well.  If you really want to, you could knock out the run to TB and get that FP as well, train the skinning there, and then hearth back to the valley of trials.
---
Is it down?
---
Fury tanking is mostly a private server thing - it wasn't that popular back in retail vanilla. It became popular on private servers once guilds farmed the same content for 10+ years and started pushing the limits of the mechanics of the game. 
---
You will be able to hold aggro just fine with mitigation / shield slam spec for all content in vanilla. Once your guild DPS gets geared and more impatient and you have all content on farm, you'll need to find more creative ways to gain additional aggro. 
---
Fury/Prot is the meta on this sub right now, but if you watch Skarm's videos on it you'll see it's a bit demanding from a consumables and gear min/maxing standpoint. You also have to have in-depth knowledge of all the bosses so you know when you can dual wield tank something vs. when you need to toss on a shield to avoid crushing blows/crits.
---
I've never done the Fury tanking building personally. I heard about it recently, but wasnt playing on PServers for it, so I never got a chance to test it out. From my understanding the enrage procs on getting crit are a huge factor in that build, thats why you have a /sit macro. However I believe a blue post recently said that enrage will NOT proc off /sit crits, so I think that takes a lot of viability out of it. 14% parry may also prove a big role in it being terrible since your tank is going to get smashed even harder. 
---
As my guilds main tank, I will be going a mitigation build that goes 17/3/31 early on and probably switch it up to more of a DPS, tanking build later on down the road when we're more geared. Mitigation is huge early on for most guilds since their tanks will be taking a beating. 
---
I've seen some builds without shield slam, but I think its HUGE for initial threat gen on a mob. Hitting them with a SS then a revenge right out of the gate it way more threat than a couple sunders which will allow DPS to go harder, faster.
---
I just googled him quickly and to me it looks like he worked on some of the best games in history (SC, D2, WC3, Vanilla WoW) and then had 1 failed game and now you're hating on him.
---
Uldaman is actually pretty straightforward.
---
I get two replies? I feel special!
---
I bought the game about a week before TBC launch and played for like 15 minutes before uninstalling. I really hated the leveling grind back then. I only really fell in love with vanilla on Nost. So for me I'm a bit nostalgic for Nost. Kinda weird
---
The best BG
---
Omg, I just remembered doing the rogue lock picking quests and upgrading it at the lumber mill. 
---
Wow, lock boxes, lol.
---
Ayudame! XD
---
Nah NA. Didn‚Äôt know there were multiple
---
People are already clearing way passed lvl 30, though. I bet at 40 most content will doable at that point. They'll probably do a closed raid test a few weeks before launch, if anything.
---
I know they have to test stuff but there is something that feels extra unfair about beta testers getting to play content that won't be released for another 9-12 months at least, if not longer.
---
Will last a hunter or rogue until like 45. Really great gear.
---
SS?
---
Create the guild that caters to your needs or be a part of creating that Guild. That's the thing about getting in on the ground floor of a project like this, you directly craft the community you want to be a part of. But like it or not you will meet people after you have joined the server and made your first character and your plans might change based on who you meet, the future is unclear we cannot plan 100% of our future fun
---
I wouldn't call WC a treasure... the loot was good but the dungeon was torture. Well over an hour long at a brisk pace and a lot of it was just walking to the next area plus the tauren NPC at the end could die.
---
Shield slam. :)
---
And the difference between them is on those games he was just a developer and on the failed one he was the one in charge. Mark Kern should not be in charge of anything.
---
This is so true. Sans the "den den", this happened frequently to me back in my vanilla days.  "Guys, I gotta AFK for like 10 mins.  Really sorry.  BRB".  Then everyone just hung out for 10 minutes, bio, ect.  Then we'd just keep going.  Putting together that dungeon run was a commitment, you weren't about to let it go down the drain cause someone had to AFK for 10 minutes.
---
They just did another big wave and included the F&amp;F invites up to tier 3, whatever that means.
---
Aesop rock :none shall pass album reminds me of the times in high school we'd camp out in my friend's basement and play wow or D2 all night
---
Tip to you rogues out there for launch: 
---
Pickpocket EVERYTHING you can as you level. From the moment you get the skill make a habit of pickpocketing humanoids right before you open from stealth, and by level 40 you will have enough for mount or be very very close. In dungeon runs pickpocket whichever elites you can before sapping/attacking too.
---
I'll tell you who's NOT looking forward to it, Gamon.
---
This is it, oh baby this is *fucking* it! Never, not once, have I had such a golden opportunity for this, I'll be telling my children of this glorious moment to be captured for the Reddit record books. I'd like to thank my main, Sui of Really Frostmane, Final Countdown Guild, the great Ion, and of course, our Lord and Savior C'Thun for allowing me this golden moment:
---
***WoooooOOOOOO^O^O^O^O^O^SH***
---
don't get your hopes up. they have said their beta invites from now on are going to be very limited. your best bet is for the stress test coming up toward the end of the month. you will see an email if you get invited to this.
---
Best kind.
---
Msg me when you quit üëå
---
They‚Äôll get trained by mages still
---
Blizzard is just trolling at this point
---
&gt; "why play that when there's a ton of better MMOs out there?"
---
There really aren't though. With a few exceptions, they're all basically rubbish and monetized out the wazoo. Most of them are massively P2W. Again with a few exceptions, they all followed WOW's lead with 'ease of play' and 'accessibility' as key elements. And their communities suffer for it.
---
People who like Destiny 2 (I played Destiny) and current Retail WOW are not going to like Classic.
---
That's okay.
---
&gt; has a subscription fee
---
I'm happy to pay $15 just to keep the trolls out. The fee requires a certain level of commitment to the game.
---
I used to know a Dwarf hunter named Gronli back in 2005ish who got so bored with the raids our guild had on farm that he tried to build a spell power gear set for arcane shot. It was 100% a meme, but the guild fed him drops (that no one else needed) and it actually worked, to an extent. Couldn't help but admire the creativity and dedication.
---
Yep lots of exp missed by me as well
---
It's not solved for me. Never played it.
---
In retail, this is 100% true.  Putting together that group and then running the content is super fast (and a lot of it automated).  In vanilla, especially some of these huge sprawling dungeons in out of the way areas (with no summoning stones or instant portals to the dungeon), you were in for HOURS of commitment.  Sometimes you just couldn't help it.
---
How about let people be excited, fuckin buzzkill.
---
Haha yep. I remember going in at 58 on my paladin wearing cloth robes.
---
That would be an excellent way to easily attract other people with similar schedules. Go to the classic forms and make posts about this future Guild and watch other people flock to the idea
---
Um, in my 15 year track record with Blizzard and their circus of retail WoW, I'd say my skepticism with their choices is justified, and I'd argue you'd be stupid to not be.
---
He did much of the hiring and team design for Vanilla. By this I mean that Blizzard did not open up positions and wait for applications; Kern and co. actively recruited many of the people for this specific project. Obviously it was a resounding success, with managers giving talented devs and artists the space they needed to express their ideas. It's not easy to put a team together that can synergize and achieve something like WoW. 
---
He later played a major role in convincing Blizzard to remake Classic. 
---
I'm not really sure what he's done to deserve ridicule, frankly. I think perhaps people like you are susceptible to media influence. He's definitely expressed wrongthink on Twitter and been blacklisted for that but I guess the question is if you allow others to think for you or not.
---
Whatever you do, dont go to "Classic Discussion" over on the ACTUAL World of Warcraft Forums. It's a shit show over there.
---
i was gonna say 24% is 24%, but warrior is harder so 24% of a player base starting as warrior doesnt mean 24% at level 60.
---
good point
---
Given that warriors are the larger percentage of the raid comp i dont see an issue with more warriors
---
For 99% of players, content in new expansion are solved too.
---
yummy ct raid and bartender
---
It‚Äôs ok you didn‚Äôt miss that much since it was just the stress test.
---
&gt;Why are you going to rush to max level when you already know everything there is to do at lvl 60?
---
Cause that's where the fun stuff is.
---
&gt;Its going to be the journey that is fun.
---
For you. Cool. 
---
&gt;It is going to be the community that is fun.
---
&gt;Barrens chat that is fun.
---
For you. Cool.
---
None of that matters for 95% of raiding guilds.
---
It's like you're pretending this is retail where there's actually a difficulty level that requires min/maxing
---
It's vanilla. It's not a hard difficulty level. If it ever comes to the point where you are in a guild that isn't pushing for server first and the guild thinks class composition matters so much you won't bring more than 2 druids, your guild has other problems. 
---
Plus, one of the reasons druids come behind on meters sometimes is because other healers snipe them. When it actually matters, and there's actually stuff to heal and healers aren't focused on topping meters but being efficient, druids do just fine.. because they have efficient heals.
---
He was a team lead in Vanilla before leaving...
---
RFD is a higher level than RFK, the highest level you can zone into at 40 should be Maraudon and ZF.
---
Because blizzard solves it for you now.
---
The blocky hair needs help. Retail hairstyles look great.
---
I always burn out in like 1 month in PoE.  For some reason that game feels more demanding (and repetitive) than any other game to me.
---
Would love have this map on something like a 60" canvas.
---
Can you make one with 2 naked male night elves
---
This is a video game, not a problem solving exercise. It doesn't matter if it's "solved", it's a fun game to play and it provides an experience that no other modern game does.
---
The thing is, you can wpvp let's say in stv at lvl 30-40 at pretty much equal gear... There is no need to get to 60 to enjoy wpvp.
---
Guilds would often lend the money to new 40s and have you pay it back over your next few levels.
---
Good job, a bit too flare-y for my taste, but still a good job. Don't listen to the haters, they have nothing better to do with their lives than being closeted and crying about it on reddit. In due time they'll come to see the joy and pride in the LGBT community aswell.
---
Wow, that reminds me - I still have an old photobucket account. I bet there's some screenshots on there still. Time to check it out!
---
I was under the impression that the beta wasn't coming back up until thursday. But maybe I'm just misunderstanding the post and it's just Arathi Basin that'll begin on thursday.
---
this is underwhelming, i dont like it. all signs prior lead me to believe it was 0.08 at least :(
---
&gt;The build seems to lack a clear focus.
---
I will heal in DG/Raid, this build is for everything else.
---
&gt;PS - Improved Inner Fire is worth about 1% additional damage reduction per talent point against physical (20 charges) Vs. 2% per talent point reduction with Spell Warding against all magic (no charge limit, cannot be dispelled). It isn't a strong talent, in fact it is quite a weak one. 
---
You have to use 5 points on holy to start to get spell warding (a 5 rank talent)  
---
Since Improved Mana Burn is really good, Inner Fire (a 3 rank talent) is a free start
---
The value of the point must take into account the way and the sacrifices to reach it
---
whaat? only thought there were two! imma check them out right now
---
Entering from BRD does not require attunement, no. That‚Äôs just to get the window entrance from blackrock mountain. You can get lvl 50s into MC if you run them through BRD.
---
Rexxar. Bet he's looking forward to people finding him in Desolace.
---
game starts at 60
---
What you misunderstood is that I'm even making an argument. Simply pointing out an issue with your claim is not an argument.
---
seems like a lazy work around that will actually impact gameplay in a negative way
---
Im really excited since everything will be fresh. 
---
everyone is starting fresh. 
---
No gold, no professions, no max level characters. No nothing. 
---
my hardest choice now is whether i pick horde or alliance.
---
Hey men great work. Just a question. I dont know if its fixed before or if cant be fixed. I noticed that every swing timer addon out there fails to calculate the next swing after heroic strike. The issue still persists or it was fixed someway along the road.
---
Thanks in advance for the awesome work. Keep it up!
---
Depending on your source: many extracts are actually made from a byproduct of the wood pulp industry mixed with ethanol and water.
---
I prefer lvl 60 world pvp.
---
Doesnt pickpocketing reduce loot? Ive always -felt- that it did
---
Yes. Raiding, best in slot gear, pvp. You name it and its solved.
---
thought that was just me.
---
Yes. I love addons.
---
There were millions in Vanilla.
---
absolutely nothing is a bit of a stretch
---
what's the opposite of ATBGE? I love the idea though lol
---
go back to r/the_donald
---
is he begging?
---
"requires quest" area in yet? Was stumped earlier when looking at a quest chain, didnt see it led to anything nor did quests that had a previous quest requirement with a different name.
---
#NoChange
---
Interesting.
---
I will go deep protection then I think. Did off tanks use the same spec?
---
I see his videos pop up a lot, but I agree, it looks heavy on consumes &amp; he is in full T3/with Thunderfury, etc.
---
A little mistake here, Soulstring hits for 176 on average (123-229 end dmg), not 147.5. It's almost as powerful as the Nerubian Slavemaker in terms of top end damage, yet it's faster (it has 3.5DPS more) :

Prot warriors should always take shield slam.  It's a huge part of threat generation.  On longer fights you probably want to get your 5 sunders up first, but then shield slam should be on cooldown to maximize damage/threat dump your rage.  Usually as the main tank you will always have rage to spend once the fight gets "rolling"
---
Personally I like the lower tier of the fury tree to pair with Prot- piercing howl is a nice utility spell to have, blood craze gets less and less useful as you go through progression but is a nice help, and enrage can also help your threat pretty substantially especially as you are gearing and still get crit decently often.
---
&gt;Improved Mindblast is a 0/5 not 0/3.
---
true, ty
---
You don‚Äôt need to clear it, you just need to do the lava run that people did back in the day for attune runs. You can skip the entire instance essentially. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôd be able to clear any trash at lvl 40 in max gear, but if people are clearing RFD at lvl 30 I‚Äôm not going to rule it out assuming everyone had BIS gear.
---
15
---
Once I hit 30 (on my main) I left that character alone. I didn't want to imbalance the quests or money (though if Im hurting for mount money at 40 I might do some quests for gold then).
---
And we're not even talking about the ones you can tame from AQ!
---
id be surprised if we dont learn a bunch of new shit, assuming the beta client is correct to vanilla people like esfand have already descovered new mechanics
---
to be fair the client could be off on some of those things though
---
A bunch of people in my guild said they just got invited in the last couple of days.
---
Solved? Wow isn‚Äôt a puzzle
---
Nice, that's exactly what I'm doing
---
I thought so RE:Shield Slam. 
---
Do you not go for tactical mastery?
---
&gt;-lvl 60 Orc Warrior 305 axes skill: Has 6% chance to miss before gear
---
I thought you needed 8% from gear?
---
That's what I was hoping for when they originally redesigned them. 
---
But they butchered them.
---
Number 11 (FD not dropping combat properly) is huge and I worry that they won't get to it. I'm normally a blizzardstan that doesn't spook easily with these bugs, but this has been a problem I've noticed in retail for a while now whenever I've activated my account. It's a minor grievance there, but with the vanilla trap system it's a game changer.
---
**please blizzard do what it takes to get that FD/Trap TIGHT - we need it!**
---
Tell the truth and Call someone mentally ill? Bigot.

---
And that‚Äôs when you don‚Äôt outgear the content. Mythic carries happen after everyone is geared and knows the fights inside and out so they can carry dead weight. You aren‚Äôt gonna clear a mythic raid with 14 people who are just barely geared enough for it.
---
tauren hunter
---
The point is it *doesn't matter* what he says about Classic, period. He clearly makes very poor professional choices (and is a nightmare to work with) and people are wanting him to practically take the reigns of Classic without any further info on the man outside of "he was a team lead in vanilla". The article summarizes his professional character; his attitude, actions, and choices. People should at least have some research on the man before they spout off stuff like that.
---
Dire Maul west and north wings were for level 60. The east wing was tuned for mid 50's or some point below 60 although it still had some decent items for fresh 60's.
---
The *best* ones were the ones not along a traditional path.
---
Im looking at you Alliance FP in Stonetalon..
---
There were certain ones i never found but it was kind of cool because people you knew or folks in general/trade chat would say things about where it was. I would look all over for flight paths unsure if they were there or not. Sometimes i would even walk past them without realizing. 
---
It was extremely rewarding to find them because it meant you didnt have to run so far to get out there. The game had so much incentive to explore back then compared to now.
---
I will lvl slowly. Enjoy quests and adventure to 60.
---
Good luck, but a lot of the common spots will be camped pretty hard.  For example the 35-38 mobs in Dustwallow right by Theramore will definitely be tough to get into.  There are also level 39-40 raptors close by that are easily AOE'd, but it might be tougher if you're 3-4 levels lower with all the resists.
---
It's true there are diminishing returns on wep skill, it's still nice to have the option to go up wep skill if you want. Sort of a luxury actually, deciding how much dagger skill you want.
---
Oh no the contents been out for years people want to play a game that's "Solved" oh no. Ya know another game that's been "solved" and people play the shit out of it still? Literally every RPG in existence. So what's your point?
---
I've only been a tauren hunter once.  When my engineering transporter backfired and turned my dwarf into one.  I did AV as an alliance tauren and it was fantastic.  The alliance rallied around me and the horde was too confused to attack be me back.  
---
I don't think death even removed the transformation debuff that lasted an hour.
---
Even this one? It resets whenever a spell in the swing reset list hits or misses. The list of spells isn't very large but these should reset the swing timer.
---
* Heroic Strike
---
* Slam
---
* Cleave
---
* Raptor Strike
---
* Maul

idk if this is like a go to insult for you or if you actually went back however many weeks to the 1 or 2 comments i wrote there.

Honestly, go fuck yourself.  I took the time to create it and like every other content creator, i wanted to share it with the CLASSIC WORLD IF WARCRAFT subreddit. I dont even get paid for this. No one is forcing you to watch the video and you could have easily just added to the discussion like many people did below.

---
same, EU acc since 2008
---
pretty sceptical but yeah...
---
Wow classic is a relic from a different generation, before loot boxes and other microtransactions with a focus on community.
---
The nostalgia helps with more outdated graphics and less interactive gameplay compared to modern games. I am hoping for a huge success and show other companies that working to a goal and having a community is what makes a game last a long time, not microtransactions or pretty graphics.
---
I am not sure where the 95% number coming from. Again we can only make assessments based on the most recent data. Raids will be very easy indeed BUT each raid will attempt to make them even easier by NOT taking 10 rogues. If the OP rolls a dwarf priest he is 100% guaranteed a raid spot over any other healer simply because of fear ward. On the other hand a raid would be reluctant to take too many druids especially if they wipe on an encounter.
---
Wait, he's Brad McQuaid?
---
hopefully twink tourneys will be a thing... not quite the same tho
---
It‚Äôs about the journey not the end.
---
Enemy cooldown trackers, enemy cast bars, some macros require addons. Addons for managing decurse and dispell alerts
---
Depending out your class, having the ability to mouse over and click on your party members to cast spells is a big deal in my opinion. Doing pvp healing on a priest is much improved when you can maintain your targeting on who ever you want and just click on your buddies to cast spells on them. I forget the name but the addon works like this; It creates new frames for yourself and party members and you can customize a bunch of different commands to cast spells. I can target an enemy to dispel them or something and to heal my friend I just mouse over their name and shift+left click to cast shield on them.
---
Hunters are cool
---
For the Alliance!!
---
male dwarf and orc look good. female human had pretty much all of the personality stripped from their faces to the point where the old ones are more unique and have more character, which is. not good. and really bothered me when my main got updated
---
I had both a femorc Warlock and eventually Femorc Warrior in Vanilla. Two most played character. 
---
became friends with the first femorc I ran into (also a warlock, who also made a warrior later) before I found out they were kind of nutso.
---
Exactly!
---
You can probably get a raid spot as a 20/31/0 paladin since you at least bring blessing of Sanc and fill another paladin blessing spot.  Plus on those fights with heavy AOE you can soak it all up like Nef phase 3 and let your pally power shine. 
---
5/5 illumination is really the core talent for healing paladins.  After that it's about getting a bit of gear that gives +spell crit and voila, you are now a holy paladin!
---
Mandela effect. But we will probably find out somewhere soon.
---
Looking better and better :)
---
One thing of note: There are still empty columns for seemingly no reason at some searches and important columns also disappear for seemingly no reason.
---
Compare this search (where both DPS and SPEED are shown and can be sorted) https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/side:1/class:1/quality:3/type:6:10:1:5:8
---
To this nearly identical search, where the only additional filter is Speed+3 and suddenly you can't sort, or even see DPS and SPEED: https://classic.wowhead.com/weapons/side:1/class:1/quality:3/type:6:10:1:5:8?filter=36;2;3

#YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET PWNED.
---
Oh, yeah, looks like Camp Taurajo is still misspelled.
---
It's really interesting to me that hunters are likely to be the second least played class, to druids, this time around.
---
Thanks mate. Unfortunatelly i didnt make it to beta, just stress test and wasnt able to test this addon. Just others swt like samuel etc.
---
Cant wait to launch and test it myself!
---
Some people played vanilla like this. New a guy who didn't raid or pvp but had 5 level 60s.
---
That's exactly what I'm doing actually. I just hope they get hyped enough to have an open mind when it releases 8/27
---
This is good news. It means tanks won't be doing 3x the threat they should be doing, and bosses won't fall over in 30 seconds because everyone is doing way more DPS than they should be because the threat ceiling is artificially high.
---
They will hold off for other streamers if there are multiple on one realm but for non-streamers you can bet your ass they won't give a shit
---
I don‚Äôt have beta? And I wouldn‚Äôt play it if I did.

&gt;yeah that's not very helpful haha. Obviously everyone has their own opinion, but seeing as most on this subreddit are of the same mind, putting our opinions to better words is what I'm asking for here.

No time limit just means in a close match it literally comes down to who /afk's out first. It's fun/epic for a weekend stress test sure, but it's pretty dumb for an actual game mode.

Still the best episode. That said South Park has aged substantially better than the likes of the Simpsons or Family guy
---
Human warrior is what I plan to roll to relive my Vanilla tanking days. That said we know all but the most dedicated warriors will end up arms.
---
I won‚Äôt be max lvl for months and I‚Äôll reroll once I get there.
---
Yeah i really dont get the hate. Im not posting my videos 24/7 i post it one time and leave it at that. All content creators/streamers do it and i genuinley dont see the issue. If you dont want to watch it just dont. If it seems interesting do.  This literally is the place for classic world of warcraft discussion. Its not like im making money doing this either lol
---
I know what you mean, but we are like 2 months out and if playing wow for 2 months burns you out then you wouldnt have made it very long anyway.
---
ugh obviously now all the hindsight geniuses come out of the woodworks
---
"Make, like, ten level 35s. They'll all be able to pay for one level 40 mount"
---
~ you, apparently
---
Maybe five second rule as well?
---
If you manage to tank effectively as a paladin in Classic then TBC wouldn't be a problem =P
---
In all seriousness though, there's no way you'll know if you can transfer a character.  I would bet you can't.  
---
You can probably spec 20/31/0 and still get raid spots as a healing pally as long as you have healing gear.  You'll be able to pick up some tank pieces assuming your guild is chill with it after your main tank(s) are geared, and there are fights (such as Nef) where having an AOE monster tank is a huge help.  
---
Even if you can't tank much in raids, you will still be a farming monster and can make good money with him, or make some goofy videos solo-ing the whole SM cathedral or something like that.
---
you sound like a fun person.
---
meh i went to jail for a year for credit card fraud. you dont know what was going on in his life, you dont know the family and people he had to support. if youre fucking dirt poor and you have sick people to look after, the fuck would you do?
---
Can't decide between VC and BRD
---
Some people with foggy memory or pserver players didn't know how hit tables were exactly going to work. this post isn't an attack on non weapon skill races. This actually confirms that 310 is not that important, which is good for non-humans/orcs and dagger specs. 305 is attainable on any race with any commonly used weapon type.
---
I use pfui (very similar) on a private server now and I love it.
---
Going to pay for that? Lmao this is just a beta. All of this will be wiped.
---
Shhh this is my secret weapon ;)
---
wtf is a purplepill?
---
&gt;  Since Improved Mana Burn is really good, Inner Fire (a 3 rank talent) is a free start    
---
Respectfully disagree that Imp. Mana Burn is good.    
---
 - Mage: They'll try to burst you down before they OOM (which is the game with or without Mana Burn). Mages are already weak to Shadow Priests.    
---
 - Warlock: Between Pet's counterspell, drain life/healthstone, and life tap counter it nicely. All while their dots tick, their pet eats your buffs, they fear, death coil, or seduce. Good luck.   
---
 - Druid: Shift immune.    
---
 - Hunter: Can be effective on non-BM hunters, but most will be BM.    
---
 - Other Priests/Healers: Annoying but rank one heals are incredibly cheap (+ high spirit/regen due to not casting) with a healer build. They won't be able to heal others (good) but will likely be able to keep themselves alive (bad). Burst kills healers. Mana Burn just stops them healing others.   
---
By all means go ahead and try it. I've tried every single talent Priests have in vanilla, including those two. I even had a set of gear with +armor on it and Imp. Inner Fire, it wasn't a huge increase in DR/survivability.    
---
The biggest use of Improved Mana Burn is to stand in the back in AV and to burn down all the healer's mana without killing them. They'd get stuff in combat and couldn't drink. In 1 V. 1 it was meh.
---
You guys might not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
Lol he plays apex legends
---
Yep. Most recent expansion was released December 2018
---
Well, I still get to play the second one tho :)
---
Not at all..
---
How is it solved if i havent beaten the top dog in a duel yet?
---
^ OP is right tbh. That doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt be excited and love the game, but yeah OP overall is correct.
---
Oh man it's been a while.. i always cry my eyes out to that video T.T
---
How are you able to do that?
---
Can't miss it when you keep checking your launcher...
---
Boi I havent had so much fun in years, he sure missed out!
---
Server transfers have been a thing in the past. I was offered a free transfer from Aggramar to Garrosh in WotLK. 
---
If you decide to play on massive server that‚Äôs your choice, it has its pros and cons. I played on Aggramar in Vanilla and it was a fairly large server. I‚Äôm sure the economy will be much better for everyone but at the same time, it will also create an issue since anyone who does gathering professions will be fighting for resources. The community will be more alive, but you‚Äôll have other issues. World Bosses will be a bitch to do. PvP servers will likely be one sided depending on which streamer is on that server.
---
But at the same time you won‚Äôt have a shortage of players for raiding. It‚Äôll be a lot easier to fill those 40 man slots. Ques are likely considering stress test servers have them.
---
I mean, I can't wait to sell runs, don't take the hype away, my customers need that
---
But both the undead and the Orc starting areas have all the same classes sub the undead zones dont have a shaman trainer. which is what he asked ORC to Undead zones.
---
Youre getting upset over a 15 year old game omegalul
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs women‚Äôs birth control
---
Check launcher, see nothing, close it, repeat.
---
I only hit roughly level 45 in vanilla before tbc hit, so I'm definitely not thinking of AV. I can't seem to find any information on it anywhere though
---
We all are hyped. But there are issues and if we dont speak up there is potential issues. Skweaky wheel gets the grease.
---
In vanilla atleast once a day id get caught up in a 90mins wsg worst i had was 3hours you says its great now but wait for a proper turtle set out on farming the wsg, i dont mind as its only 1 bg but 15min wsg games is alot nicer
---
because nothing came close to the fun it provided
---
Lol you kids are funny
---
for them to actually have the alliance tourney without delaying it more
---
Hunters are retarded and speak their own language.
---
Right? I thought everyone was doing that too!
---
I love it and welcome the change.
---
The 50s gear that came with Str, Agi, and Stam was some of my favorite. It took so little Agi for warriors to get a benefit compared to Agi based classes. But yeah, don't go ignoring stamina...
---
This is just anti-Tauren propaganda. Heres the real equation. Real big shoulder + Real big weapons = Real big damage.
---
The itemization was hilarious. Hunters wanted that giant sword from ZG for the stats, and would wear leather for agility regularly pre-raid gear.  
---
I remember farming lower level resist gear for aq40
---
Yep cuz playing to level 30 is all there is!
---
Yeah I hope we get more votes on classes. Especially since this poll confirmed what I already knew so far and saw from other polls / comments... But I still want tangible results to back up what I told my friends :D
---
Enjoy level 40!
---
Hell no, I was just going for some hyperbole regarding how mind numbing running Emp over and over was. I kept track, literally hit 300 runs without seeing Ironfoe. Eventually got a Deathbringer and never looked back.
---
And yet this sub downvotes. Thats how i know logic isnt present. Just emotions.
---
I'm starting to see the pros and cons of both.
---
lets see you climb over iron forge then [mutha fuckalaawawaawaaaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olaeqfvMJ4A)
---
Makriks wife.
---
Sorry, I mean "Beaten Corpse".
---
I've missed this artstyle. Nobody does it anymore. It's the reason i couldn't stop flipping the pages in my vanilla guide.
---
Which shoulders are those?
---
Spirit is useful for every class in Classic.  Warlock can regen while wanding after DOTing the target, Mage can regen faster after a pull.
---
I could add it for the hunter bar stuff but I feel like making a general 5 second timer is drifting away from the intention of the addon. If I'm going to make a general 5 second rule timer it would be a completely separate addon.
---
There are functioning add-ons available *right now*.  Questie, for example, works just fine.  I even installed it during the stress test just to see how far along it was.
---
Not true at all. Just calling out a shit post where the OP can't even read the ToS they are insisting some asshat didn't break.
---
You're a clown and a shit troll to boot.
---
Just wanted to show this gem from back then.
---
All these kind of videos that got created with wow animations back then were really nice!
---
I put my pet on passive in dungeons, but defensive was far superior out in the open world.
---
We stress testers had our access removed a few days ago. The account doesn't even show up in our launcher anymore. ;(
---
When we did have access all we saw was the Stress Test server, not the others. So assuming it's not a mid-update bug, then congrats you lucky SoB.
---
There's a few options:  
---
* /random
---
* gold runs
---
* server wide EPGP pugs  
---
Though, the last is certainly the rarest and requires community trust and support of the group organizing the runs.
---
 Hello all! 
---
Currently deciding between Rogue, Priest, and Mage. Looking for a main and one alt, don't want more characters than that.  First a bit of background:
---
I mained a Tauren Resto Druid from Vanilla ‚Äì WoTLK  and an Undead Mage from MoP through BFA. I don‚Äôt mind healing this time around but would prefer to DPS as my main spec.   My leveling partner is going to be a Warlock but we‚Äôll all group together in various ways. My schedule will allow me to play frequently but tough to plan on specific times.
---
Of my 10 friends coming back we have 3 Holy/Disc Priests, 3 Warriors,  2 Warlocks,  1 Mage and 1 Resto Shaman.  0 Rogues, Druids, or Hunters.  
---
**Priest**:  Had been set on Priest until I learned I wasn‚Äôt alone in my choice. However, the other 3 will heal along with the Shaman, leaving me to focus on Shadow which is what I'd really want. Leveling would be amazingly quick and efficient as an undead shadow priest along with my undead warlock friend.  Re-speccing to heal at 60 if I want is always an option too. This class has a lot to offer with unique spells like mind control.
---
Only negative of priest is that 6 of my other friends are clothies and I would be the 7th. Tons of competition in dungeons for cloth gear and Shadow damage gear when leveling. However my gut still says priest is what I want to play at the end of the day.
---
**Rogue**:  Rogue seems to be an obvious choice given the breakdown of my friends are playing. I‚Äôd be the only melee dps, only leather wearer aside from the resto shaman, and I love the idea of Rogues in general. Always kept one as an alt but never a main. My only fear is that there are too many rogues outside our group and Rogues don‚Äôt add a ton of utility to groups aside from damage.  
---
**Mage**: As mentioned above, Mage has been my main since MoP and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it. I know what I‚Äôm doing in frost PvP and feel I‚Äôd have a lot of success. Always wanted to see what my Mage would‚Äôve been like had I picked one in classic.  Bonus points for not having to respec as frequently between pvp and pve, portals, food/water, etc‚Ä¶  Negatives are basically the same as Priest and Rogue ‚Äì there are lots of mages out there and I‚Äôd be competing  heavily for gear in every 5 man.
---
Thanks everyone!
---
I usually only have 2, hunter macro auto shot and hunterattack, if attackstate return, if target friendly assist.
---
I've been playing private servers to quench my thirst until August.
---
ALL video game content is "solved" lol 
---
This post makes me think you just learned this word in this context literally minutes before making this post. 
---
Otherwise you probably would have thought about how it applies to all video games and not felt so clever posting it
---
I don't follow
---
I don't know, are there really that many ppl who do it that it would impact them? I mean must be banning ppl all the time for other reasons anyway.
---
Was it you? Did you actually run into yourself?
---
I'M IN BOYS - will update post soon with proof.
---
NA 2005 btw
---
Personally you can usually get through any fight sitting in Def stance the whole time.  But tact mastery definitely helps.  The big one is berserker rage in case the boss fears, but if you have it macro'd its just a button press and you lose some rage.  Overpower kind of helps, but you also take more damage when you get out of Def so if you're really struggling to stay alive you're safest in def stance spamming shield block rather than messing around in different stances. 
---
That being said you can definitely go 15/5/31 and get Anger management, Tact Mastery, +parry, and improved HS.  This would be a perfectly suitable "most tanky possible" type of build: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AvDBATAFzxfQH0A
---
On the other hand the fury-focused prot build would be more like this: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AAMzHQwFzxfAH0A
---
I kind of like having enrage while you're gearing up because it means when you get crit you get a big boost to damage (and threat).  This is a build focused on sitting in Def stance basically at all times, whereas Tact mastery you can mess around more.  Personally I learned to tank without Tact mastery (I was leveling fury warr) and so I just learned to deal with everything in def stance- the only time I'd leave was for zerker rage if a fear was coming or to charge into a fight if it was safe to build some initial aggro for the start of the fight then switch into def after one or two global cooldowns.
---
I hope something like this happens when Classic is live, and its not "high pvp society" invite only. 
---
I fucking loved duels in Vanilla and met most of my best friends doing so outside of Org. No better memories existed than all those duels I had, even if it could be horribly unbalanced.
---
If anyone remembers fighting Fione or Annalynn on Sargeras horde give me a shout.
---
Then I guess I would ask them why the heck they are so overly concerned with what other people find potentially fun about classic? Or rather, what's wrong with individual hype? Is it somehow a turn off that other people get so overly over-the-top excited about this game?
---
I laughed too hard at this, thank you.
---
Wpvp at level 40 means anyone above 40 can come stomp you...
---
Because it's cool to like old stuff, dude. Hate on anything new or progressive!
---
pubs - "Publics" - others, not us, 'randos'
---
Pugs are collections of pubs.
---
Actually all azshara is great for farming
---
It has this Pixar/wildstar vibe now. Everything is so bouncy looking and I hate it.
---
Cool
---
You're not the only one m8 I signed up today as well after finding out lol.
---
And with all that Blizzard devs/directors are still "lazy"!
---
weird flex, but ok
---
However, if you spec as a healer or tank and run low level dungeons to level up, you end up leveling at a decent rate and you typically have great gear all the time. That is only if you have a group to run with. Not as easy as with the dungeon finder but still pretty good. Questing as a holy priest was not fun. Sure, I could keep myself alive for a long time and pick away at a mob or two's health but much better to have 3 dps and a tank kill everything for you.
---
Vacations are different from sitting on your ass clicking boars
---
But I guess it comes down to, a person who has played classic or early Warcraft before and is excited about it will never be able to fully explain those reasons to a person who has not experienced early Warcraft. Because part of it is on quantifiable and looking to recapture certain feelings or experiences.
---
4 people who have not experienced it I would say, I'm your goddamn friend I'm going to be playing this game and that's plenty enough reason for you to want to play the game. LOL.
---
Ah man. We're the same age and I could probably write 500 words about my Vanilla experience. I didn't do the RP thing to the degree you did, but It was such a special game in a special time. 
---
Thank you so much for sharing. It's stuff like this that makes me get so much more hyped for Classic. 
---
I just pray my old ass isn't gonna suffer from Rose Colored Glasses.
---
Hard to argue with this logic
---
Yeah who cares if the actions of him and his father put thousands of people's lives on the line because their source of income was suddenly cut off.  I mean that has got to be completely devastating and potentially homewrecking but hey at least it isnt rape right!?!? 
---
The guy totally isnt dodging paying tax while being Bankrupt by doing what he's doing with streaming either mmhmmmmmm?
---
Some kind of unit frames and a threat meter. If anything more than probably just interface stuff.
---
Has Auctioneer ever actually worked? When it came out players starting doing crazy auctions to screw up the mod listings...
---
who ever was Raid leader to could move the groups around or even move you to new groups. but you automatically joined the raid in WSG.
---
Not vanilla.
---
Also i disagree with OP. Yoi can level quickly and efficiently and still enjoy it
---
Humans 5% Spirit doesnt help in PvE? Dafuq you saying
---
Unfortunately while the skin was toggle-able, the old animation set was NOT toggle-able which defeated the entire fucking point.
---
It's solved before it even gets final press, ALL modern video games are "solved" experiences, dude is just "Imverysmart" candidate 2001 who just leaned this word from a YouTube video 30 mins before the post
---
Same, EU account from 2008
---
Have fun having a really difficult time finding dungeon groups then.
---
BRD should have been a large open area in the world rather than a dungeon.
---
LOL I thought the first picture was a reference to one of the Saw films with face torture thing
---
\*In his dueling tournament stream Tipsout tabbed to his desktop where a folder that was called his real name was sitting.
---
Google isnt that hard.
---
Guy doxxed himself through pure stupidity.
---
Or made years of game time in legion when the market was lulz
---
FUCK
---
Enchanting and Skinning to Dust/Vendor while leveling. Then Enchanting/Engineering.
---
Well. You can Just Check the VOD :-) Everyone can proof itself. People are Just to dumb to use VoDs instead they downvote.
---
Play whatever race you want. Dwarf isn't that big of a deal.
---
Im no Mark Kern fan, but the idea of "bad boss=bad ideas" is idiotic.
---
Without a doubt!
---
Im in as well! 2008 account EU
---
Are you sure? Literal video evidence.
---
Be careful, some people here take it personally when you mention the "n" word.
---
You'd have very low damage if you went SL at 40. No imp corruption, no nightfall, can't drain life. A spriest that can dispel your VW shields would easily beat you.
---
No actually the people in what ever thread you boiled over reading were. In this thread we are just mocking you lol
---
it helps about 5%
---
someone link the video where he was actually crying on stream for "rent money" while living in his million dollar villa.
---
Very nice!
---
Still a Bug :-)
---
Excellent loot, multiple non-linear paths, challenging bosses, Quel'Serrar...
---
Same! EU account, subbed since '05!
---
Hmmm, I'm getting different opinions in my WhatsApp and discord groups as they seem to remember it. I think I'm gonna have to try and find an official source on this.
---
What do you mean solved? After you kill KT in naxx, he just respawns next week. The game is never solved
---
Nah it's different here, your playstyle in PvP is affected significantly by wotf, whereas gnomes' intellect is minor as an enemy.
---
But I agree, just go ally lock :)
---
no, I‚Äôm literally playing the beta right now. I thought it was just the visual bug from last time too.
---
Brongs viewers to his youtube channel which has been his main place for posting conting and (presumably) his main income source
---
Hm, I've got art on this reddit account and on Artstation under the same name!
---
Roll a Dwarf Priest and guild masters will beg you to join their guild.
---
I genuinely can't play any other games nothing scratches that itch that is and will be classic wow.....
---
Counter argument - play what you want. Top .1% of the top tier raiding guilds most likely already have their players. Also classic raiding isn‚Äôt hard and there will be tons of guilds looking for healers. Priests are in high demand because they‚Äôre simply just the best healers in the game. So if you want to play a human priest. Play it. If you don‚Äôt, then don‚Äôt.
---
Because the server holds 3000 when they're all spread around the map. When everyone is starting in the same zone doing the same quest, they need layering
---
Nice.
---
Remember to grind the elementals in Arathi for the Crests that drop for the Warrior Whirlwind Axe quest.
---
Anyone can loot them and they sell on the AH for people with Warrior alts.
---
Leatherworking will make the biggest bank at 60. Those cured rugged hides will be 30g+ per with mats less than a gold(not counting refined salt which the real money spot)
---
Streamers are rushing so they are the first to clear content and most people are streamer fanbois and want to do the same as their fav streamer, and theres nothing wrong with that
---
Ok, what about Horde Rogue vs Gnome's escape artist.
---
Incoming copypasta
---
LAUNCH THE BLOODY GAME BEFORE I PISS MESELF!!
---
Id level quicker if you could. Idk of a decent raiding guild that would be doing any meaningful recruitment that far in
---
Cough.. swamp of sorrows.. cougars..
---
I 100% agree with you honestly, I just meant that you couldn't fully plan out the entire route and expect it to be correct.
---
Fewer gnomes, lower impact.
---
So multiplicatively less relevant ;)
---
Only players that participated in a stress test can enter?
---
Why I would choose any other race? Because I like how they look
---
A better question would be, why are you so butthurt over Mark Kern?
---
Yeah over the next few months that I‚Äôm still playing the Beta...
---
Not even mad
---
Fixed it, uploading it right now.
---
nope, the beta is for anyone who was flagged for an invite.
---
I goofed, I fished, I professional, I really got into the quests and lore...made it to level 17. Looks like I'm waiting for the live version like the rest of y'all!
---
Nah, I was in both stress test, no invite here :(
---
Any alliance Mage/Lock who cares about raiding will be Gnome.
---
meanwhile my option for beta disappeared from bnet launcher LUL
---
https://youtu.be/WNVHehtMsk4
---
Chess is a 1500 year old game. It is solved. Every strategy has been figured out and mastered. Why keep playing it.
---
Surprised about the Hunters. People underrate how incredibly usefull and easy to lvl are.
---
How will guilds down rag in day 3 now?
---
Shhhh... This is what I'm going. I plan to be the only one. ;D
---
server restarted let us know if it was a bug or not
---
That's the sad part. I was checking my launcher. I saw the server in the drop menu then checked my inbox with no email and just assumed I couldn't get in without an invitation.
---
Then I check my spam today after making a comment about how "everyone was able to download the stress/beta client" because I had it in my dropdown.
---
Then I was informed "Uhhh no that means you were invited"
---
No luck here :(
---
Vape lyfe  https://imgur.com/xpZrb7v
---
Rip definitely a bug
---
It's beta.. the economy doesn't matter at all. The whole point is to test the game
---
Get rid of it now
---
I dont need reminders of the outside world
---
Sure, but look at census. Always more undead as % of horde than gnome as % of ally.
---
well, that's gone now
---
when did you start playing?
---
quality satire. most people overdo it, but I didn't even notice until the /s at the end.
---
f
---
I don‚Äôt agree with this. Plenty of guilds will still be recruiting 3-4 months after launch. You aren‚Äôt gonna get server first. But you‚Äôll be able to raid.
---
DRUID!!
---
Hi, /u/gra1w
---
jokes on me, I had "Beta and Stress Test" in my launcher for the stress test and would periodically check to see if I had beta access, now I don't even have that... feels bad man.
---
Once you hit 60, you then start grinding dungeons for your Preraid BiS. Farm reps for profession recipes you need, level up your professions, get attuned to the raid, farm gold/mats for potions/flask.
---
so basically you're saying that you're not even going to be playing the game and questioning why people are excited wanting to try to get server first clears if they never got to do it back then? or why they want to be one of the first players to rank 14(even tho that doesnt exist in phase 1)?
---
Hahaha, new models bad, upvotes to the left!
---
Or they are simply giving classic out for free to subscribers of retail
---
I think we had to do the same. Nature resist fear was in maraudon if I remember right?
---
Oh no I checked it and saw I could download the client but assumed without an email invitation it was useless. I thought everyone could download the client, just not log into it.
---
Not sure how to feel about this, I mean I get it testing and all but with streamer culture it feels a bit sad that all of it'll be shown and done before launch? I had hoped they'd leave it at some cap at least. (yeah pservers exist I get that, but it's not the same especially since that's not as overwhelmingly in your face)
---
Same; subbed since 2014!    Kappa
---
can't say for sure I guess, it certainly works on certain pservers
---
"If you hold the key pressed you are shouting louder then you releasing it"
---
Ah, sweet, more false hope!
---
Really hoping for LoseControl or something similar. 
---
I hate having to skim my buffs/debuffs for what kind of CC stopped me; having the icon appear over my character is so much easier.
---
That's just odd. Never in my years of playing have I ever heard anyone actually use "pubs". It's just a PuG, or PuGs. Thanks though!
---
Both Dwarf and Human have Desperate Prayer which I really like. But Human's Feedback is terrible (costs more than it burns!) and Dwarf's Fear Ward is amazing.  
---
Then looking at racials: Dwarfs have an anti-Rogue/Hunter/Melee ability in Stoneform whereas all humans get is Perception which doesn't really work, and The Human Spirit which is legit good but only 5% spirit (+1.25 spell power w/Spiritual Guidance).      
---
In PvP a Dwarf wins outright. In PvE raids technically your second or third Priest would be better off as human, but Dwarfs are incredible and every alliance raid needs at least one. In 5 mans and smaller content the differences aren't significant.
---
I saw my stress test client gets updated even though they removed my stress test from the drop down menu... I checked the drop down and even though the client got updated, i unfortunaltey have no beta access and also stress test option is still gone.
---
No, its gone.
---
I‚Äôm gonna do an Orc Rogue because I‚Äôm *different*
---
This post should be getting much more appreciation considering most people on this sub will be checking wowhead daily once classic goes live.
---
Yes it does, but i imagine, anyone above your lvl will most likely be "I GOTTA GET TO 60 ASAP" and at 60 they will probably farm gear instead of farming low lvls in stv.
---
A undead rogue only guild would be fun
---
They make up for it by current male Tauren models being just the worst and also apparently shorter than orcs now.
---
Does EU have its own test servers? I've been in the beta for a while (NA) but I can't see any realms available, are people able to log in right now?
---
well only a lucky few....
---
That's a weird reason, considering you can change it to show local time instead of server time.
---
I completely agree. This seems like a huge mistake to me. My hype has decreased significantly since before the beta came out
---
I only listened to Guns N Roses through more than half of BC because I'm poor and all I had were ear buds. My desk was little and in our hallway and I took turns on the pc sometimes. My parents wouldn't let me put the PC on the desk so I can reach my headphones and I was the only person gaming on this one. So I was stuck using my Ipod to pass the time.  
---
When I hear paradise city I literally think of Eversong Woods and can't get it stuck out of my head these days.
---
EU 2005 and R14 ... nothing
---
&gt;"Dude that's the mage that I always see in the BGs!!". We battled each other in Felwood for at least an hour.
---
RIP, won't have that feeling in classic
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Yeah really just depends on mob. I have gotten no hits because of leeway and generally always 1.
---
Fast cats and big boys are exceptions but when you get the big boys out of initial area you're good. :)
---
But for a lot of players it's also unexperienced content.
---
I started when Cata launched and played a handful of characters to max level on both factions. Once I did that I wanted to experience all the zones and classes to the best of my ability.
---
This is going to be a slightly familiar, but mostly new game to me that I'm really looking forward to.
---
they are also god of goldmaking. I think their pop will be far more on live
---
Never bought a single shitty expansion past BC. Took a one year sub the minute they've announced classic requirements and got in immediately.
---
Is a quest for zul farrak
---
The nostalgia from this video is immense. First time I watched this I was maybe 12... 11 years ago... take me back
---
What'd you use to upscale these?
---
You can dig up articles from 10 years ago asking I Blizzard needed to go free to play to continue on. People continue to say that, regardless of how well the subscriptions are.  
---
They will literally be making a ton of money for the next few years rehashing content they already produced once, but tweaking it for the new client.
---
Well it really is up to you. What class are you playing/role are fullfilling? Do you want to try raiding or are you happy doing dungeons? Find yourself a guild or at least a group of people with the same end goals as yourself and go from there.
---
 There is always demand for raiders and I'm sure you won't be the only one joining up that didn't try the end game back in the day.
---
Keep in mind that certain classes/specs will have a lot easier time getting raid slots than others-for example a holy pally will always be welcomed where as a retadin might not even be accepted in a guild.
---
Won't be there in live but there'll be an addon for it.
---
what the fuck is F&amp;F
---
Source for next stress test date?
---
indeed
---
Im playing on a private vanilla server. You should do the same. Just like beta, my progress is meaningless because im going off to live servers in august. Indont care for beta at all.
---
I loved the holiday AV events, our guild used to raid AV as gnomes to blow off steam between raids
---
It helps more like 0.005%.
---
Aww man haha. If it were me I'd have just logged in to see if I could.
---
I bailed out on TBC over a month ago at level 68.  The closer Classic got, the less I felt like wasting time on a server that I'm just going to abandon in a few months.
---
Yes, I was young in the world of bars management at the time
---
No it isn't available when you reach 60, you can pick it up when Phase 5 starts if im not getting the phases mixed up.
---
That build will pull significantly lower damage than a properly specced cat. Of course this doesn't matter if you aren't playing optimally, but you are lacking on:
---
- Feral Aggression
---
- Improved Shred
---
- Savage Fury
---
- Leader of the Pack
---
- Natural Shapeshifter
---
- Natural Weapons
---
- Omen of Clarity
---
You can sacrifice a couple of these things and still be okay, but this is way too many hits to cat form to actually play it seriously. It already struggles to keep up, you can't cut corners on it and still perform.
---
/u/a1337noob tagged FYI.
---
SM is definitely worth it for certain classes.  Drops are great, and quest rewards are good too. 
---
Enh shaman come to mind- Ravager or Mograine's might are pretty good% chance and are huge DPS boosts, and there's a lot of good mail gear for level 40 as well.  Zerker helm, Herod's shoulder, Gauntlets of divinity, etc. 
---
Travel time isn't wasted if you do the quests/get the FP while you're out there.  For ally for example, everyone has to run to Desolace at some point.  Buckle up, buckaroo!  But then once you're there, get the flight point at Nigel's point (very soon after entering from Stonetalon) and talk to teh guy and Whammo- now you're good and can do the Deso quests.
---
Fear ward on dwarfs was much better than the lame 5% spirit
---
Wrong.
---
maths was never my strong suit lol
---
what is it like 25 spirit or less?
---
A couple issues with that idea;
---
The minimum required level for maximum profession training is 35. While you can leave your alt level 5 for a short while, you'll eventually need to hit the required levels *alongside* your main in order to keep the professions relevant.
---
Mail is expensive. 30c per item adds up very quickly, especially when an item vendors for under 50c. I can see your idea becoming fruitful in the 30-60 range, but anything below that is a total waste of time.
---
Either way.. I'll probably take this idea into consideration. I appreciate your contribution to this discussion!
---
!remindme 86 days
---
Nope, I‚Äôve mained rogue since vanilla and have always, always macro‚Äôd PP to every opener. So much extra gold.
---
But even so, if it's a couple hours off, it gives more information than none.
---
My hardest choice is everything! All the classes, races professions are so much fun and unique! HOW DOES ONE PICK!?
---
I have sinned, the hype is so big and I can't wait, so I tried a private server for the first time in years. BfA is so bad I can't stand it anymore for 3 more months. 
---
I'm not playing hardcore as I plan playing on the actual Classic release, just figuring level routes, trying different classes. It's really more fun than I expected. I'm not afraid of getting burned, because as I said I'm not playing hardcore.
---
RIP the dream
---
I can agree on that for sure. They lost all fearfactor, they are just now literal standing cute cows
---
It's purely a temporary convenience for the devs to help bugfix
---
Won't be behind Shamans/Paladins for obvious reasons too
---
This I can understand but honestly low lvl pvp is as much enjoyable. Just make a 180 on a current retail progress system where only endgame matters. What is the point of being 60 asap? You want to have an advantage above others? So you enjoy just having better gear and smashing others? I think being at 40~~ lets say is more balanced cause most are not gearing bis at that point, while at 60 you can have a fresh 60 and t1 60.

Less than 30 times that\*

I get like 50s for lvl 50 quests.

I was in this age group when WoW launched, and I'm still in this age group.  It really should've been broken down.

So that's when the race starts
---
You need more bear dances in your life friend.
---
Thanks for that info. Good to know classic wowhead is looking forward to implement this. I really hope it hits somewhen soon before the official release :)
---
you literally have no shot lol
---
or more sometimes lol
---
Census data from what? Reddit users? That barely skims the surface of people that are going to play.
---
interesting site, thanks man
---
Cringe
---
you should see the floor around my computer chair/desk :D
---
i think they did a fantastic job.
---
Really? :( That's annoying, because otherwise you have to remember to go check another clock elsewhere, or your phone. It's much easier to keep track of how much time you're gaming with an in game clock. It certainly doesn't affect gameplay lol.
---
You can make any item you want by editing the item strings.
---
For example, type this: 
---
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("\124cff1eff00\124Hitem:727:0:1284:0:0:0:0:0:0\124h[Notched Shortsword of Agility]\124h\124r");
---
and it will let you link this which is a level 5 sword with 46 agility.
---
Yeah people think 10h AV is great, but they will soon realise how everyone just quits trying after the first hour or even sooner and nothing really happens for a long time in almost all of the cases
---
I've removed many not so nice comments.
---
Be kind to one another.
---
There's nothing you said that I didnt know, and you even accused me of "transcribing a video I've never seen." The laundry of list of reasons that Druids are inferior main tanks to Warrios are not irrelevant --  they're the reasons Druids are not the main tank meta. 
---
There's no need to get this upset over it or get this triggered, but it is certainly the truth. 
---
&gt;**equal/better when the guild has no TF.**
---
vs
---
&gt; **as well or almost as well** as a warrior
---
[Neat](https://media1.tenor.com/images/83116dac5575fef19f9a39e17984e7bd/tenor.gif?itemid=9264828).
---
Meanwhile: 
---
&gt;Skarm: Speedrunning guilds won‚Äôt take a Druid over a Warrior (for reasons that have nothing to do with TF)
---
Anyway, one of the first things I said was the Druids are strictly better in early 60 content. I also never said Druids could never main tank or off tank. I've seen Druids pull off main tank raids first hand. Again, you've shown me nothing I don't know. When I said druids don‚Äôt have a role in the endgame meta, I‚Äôm obviously talking about the endgame main tank meta. Druid OT are super useful in the off tank Meta.
---
The fact that Druid main tank videos are noteworthy at all only proves that they are, in fact, not meta. I don't even want to show you the private server meta. 
---
But yes, you should absolutely play the niche role of main tank raiding Druid.  Your heart and personal identity are clearly tied to it. Although it‚Äôs sub-optimal, its absolutely more than doable if you‚Äôre guild is willing to work around its shortcomings.
---
You didn‚Äôt run damage poisons while leveling?
---
Noted
---
You only really need to be a dwarf priest if you plan to join a shitty guild with a shitty and lazy main tank, that don't know how to stance dance.

To say they suck before r14 gear or equivalent is a bit disingenuous, however your point still stands that they are incredibly gear reliant to be monsters. I agree a lot of people are looking at warriors without having played them or realizing this fact.
---
Yes but dwarf is better. You can pick human it's not a huge deal.
---
You can finish in 15. All you have to do is get the flag back :)
---
This looks cropped or zoomed.  The left/right sides of the UI are cut off.
---
I know this is old, but how stupid Are you dude? The polls rate class distribution among horde vs alliance, so you cant x2 the amount Because its on 1 side, Even if the polls was not faction split, thats not how math works. Shaman/paladin/druid/warlock Are extremely underplayed. Thats a fact
---
Im joking
---
Thank you very much for your time, you are the one I was looking for.
---
Mage: I was thinking about silence+mana burn combos like 5s silence = 2,5 MBurn +2,5 MBurn.  
---
Reducing the reaction time and increasing the mps drained in all fights
---
Warlock: MBurn deals damage too, life tap makes it a pure damage spell.  
---
Locks are a real deal.  
---
But as I intend to play in the alliance, as a dwarf, this problem is not as big as it usually is in duels, for example.
---
Druid/Hunter:  I do not see them as big problems, maybe I'm underestimating them.
---
Priest/Healer: Mana Burn is really to break the heal on enemies, Mind Blast is much better if the intent is to kill  
---
 Once you have enough experience, what build do you intend to use in classic?
---
Could have flagged that as NSFW....
---
I entered classic a year into it. And got to raid naxx. I wouldn't be too worried about it.
---
Ugh you're making me tired now... Look at the thousands of pserver players (can check online for the class breakdown)
---
Okay that's my last response haha I was amused at first but you'll just irritate me if we keep going. Ciao
---
yessir, have had too clean this thing out all too often, lessons learned. When my 2080tis get here itll definitely be on the desk... and yes ill still be playing on classic graphic settings with 2080tis lmfao
---
You're welcome :)
---
I agree, I love the new models. If they allowed me to have all the gameplay of classic, with the new models and animations. 11/10 would do.

Wow! Thanks guys.

I will put this to good use. Thank you

[seeing those deletes i could just couldnt help myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1UtRnGn5hc)
---
If im playing an undead warrior tank, does this means my BIS is the gloves that give weapon expertise? Or is there anything else i can use to get to 305+?
---
Thanks for clarifying this!  I think I'll definitely be mixing a lot more spirit gear into my feral/resto druid.  Not that they don't already have a shit ton of sustain, but I'm excited to see how far I can push it and get the most out of the mana regen in between forms.  The new knowledge of how the spirit works should allow me to use more offensive spells as openers in between heals.
---
Thanks again :)
---
Reckoning AoE reflect damage builds have been meme across private servers for a while now.
---
Every rule has exceptions
---
if you have to ask, you dont have it
---
Yeah like I said it‚Äôs coming from a very old photobucket account. All of the pictures on it are like this.
---
It comes with AQ40 in phase 5. The materials gathering also starts there. Once all the resources are gathered it will take a few days, 5 I think, for the gong to become active. Then you bang it to open the raid and whoever else bangs it within 11 hours or so also get the mount. 
---
The questline remains active though so you can still complete it afterwards, you just don't get the mount. The healing dagger is pretty good so you see people way after AQ has been opened that still goes for it.
---
Oh and btw the title was added in TBC. You only get the mount in Vanilla.

---
It would be, indeed. It's more a tale of making the best of a bad situation.
---
I did almost nothing but BGs in Vanilla. Very long games can be rough but they can also be very fun, and I prefer the risk of a long game to having a short time limit like 15 minutes. I wouldn't be opposed to a longer time limit like 45 minutes to an hour though.
---
The way we dealt with this issue in Vanilla was to queue AB because it's nearly impossible for those to go for an extended period of time.
---
God, I used to do 10 Strat Dead sides per day after I hit 60. I wanted that mount so bad for my priest and I never got it.
---
You will see, just like in the past Human Male Priest will be the least played. Terrible for PVP, PVE and even RP/looks (paladin can use priest gear for looks while able to wear any other items for RP)
---
I think I lasted 2days in Synthesis before just not wanting to play anymore &gt;&lt;
---
West fall. Like fuck did I hate questing there because those defias fucks would rip me in half. But I did love the whole ‚Äúoutpost‚Äù feel to it.
---
Ya maybe not for you someone who hasn't played much Chess.
---
thank \*clapping emoji\* you \*clapping emoji\*
---
\*whew\* that was hard work
---
The same reason people read books that they have already read.
---
Stick legs, with rigid motions, and 3 pixel faces have never looked fearsome. Except me imaging that guys chiropractor bill after waddling around the barrens with out bending any knees.
---
Well in classic u dont have an auto shown clock, u gotta hover the sun/moon icon to see it.
---
it only matters if you really care about minmaxing :)
---
Techinically human has higher hps but thats not a big deal. Most raids need like 3 dwarf priests really so you could fill the 4th or 5th slot
---
ah ye i can confirm i got beta inv
---
fuck ye
---
You can start before then, rogues can buy 5 BOE BIS pieces starting as early as 43 and farm Marudon for the Blackstone Ring long before 60.
---
How do you reserve your name?
---
Sameeee!
---
The liquor store isn't even open so I can not deal with this big of a bait.
---
Probably wouldnt work.  Their fanboys would raise a fuss until someone can wake them up/get them online/whatever for them to do it.
---
I played it on a shitty school laptop with 2GB ram, a core 2 duo and integrated graphics back in 2008. So definitely on low settings.
---
Reflect builds work even without reckoning cheese. And Reckoning is a good talent even without the sit meta. When pulling 4-5 mobs at once, you will get crit often enough for Reckoning to proc a lot and your reflect damage will do the rest.
---
Jesus Christ. I have a lot I need to catch up on hahah.
---
No Idea they are the best race in the game ofc
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b4wz4u/distribution_of_race_and_class_according_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Here‚Äôs a good poll. It‚Äôs separated with factions and classes.
---
&gt; You want to have an advantage above others?
---
yes, among other things, but not for the reason you seem to be implying.  
---
its not about about stomping others, its about stomping the game.  
---
i want an easier time through dungeons.  
---
i want to compete for top of the dps charts in raids.  
---
i want to farm fast, and do it asap. theres rep, honor, epic mount cost, enchants costs, consumables costs, respec costs and all sorts of other stuff  
---
essentially i want to be on the forefront. Dont want to be spending all my time playing catch-up and getting stomped by the those on/at the forefront.
---
Well i can understand the good part of it and the bad part. U can always hover the moon/sun icon to see the time anyways
---
Dual spec could have worked if it required you to visit the master class trainers, and maybe even had a 2hr+ cooldown on it. Might even be good to keep a nominal gold cost to it or require some reagents you could farm up in the world.
---
At the very least what would have been nice is for you to be able to have a few preset specs/actionbar layouts so that even though it cost you 50G, you'd at least be able to be up and running fairly easily.
---
There's too many subsets of the game where you're pretty much expected to min/max by the folks you're playing with, and the respec cost mainly punishes tanks and healers which is kinda double-shitty. Personally I think WoW is a better game when people spend their time on their mains, it creates stronger player identity.
---
But if we're doing 1.12 again then I'll have to level and gear a 2nd character like I did back in the day, and just play my Priest during raids/dungeons.
---
that was moving
---
This guy Vanilla'd
---
Checked mine on 5/16, got my beta email on 5-17.
---
I disagree. I think the beta is overstaying its welcome a bit. Servers aside, at a certain point you have to wonder why they didn't just release the game early access style. Because at this point it seems like we're pretty much getting the game in the beta.

I definitely do not know the circumstances, but i know enough to know i do not want him representing Classic WoW. That is not a decision one man gets to make, but the community as a whole. No one, least of all me, is suggesting we become the law and judge as such - but we do get to judge him as a person, for his actions, and decide what we think.

Yeah you could Join Alpha xD

You are welcome :)

SM I think, or maybe some of the 50-60 content that became marginalized after tbc release

If you run out of time just leave, it‚Äôs not a league of legend match. The timer completely took the fun out of wsg because it‚Äôs become first to cap then turtle.

Play what you want. Be ready to get shit from min maxers for not going dwarf. I knew plenty of human priests back in the day. You will be fine.

---
They are practically. You can make it through on any raids withouth dudu heal. Try to say that to priest-sham/pala
---
Easier to just ask, will you be playing it?
---
I simply disagree. If you're wiping in early vanilla raids, it's not because of class composition. Within reason of course. Raids with completely equal class compositions can raid up to late AQ40 easily, even while making mistakes and not being close to optimal. They just won't be the fastest.
---
And that's fine for most.
---
What was your name in Deja? I was in A-Team dwarf Warrior Mutiny. :)
---
All Horde Rogues are going Orc and the majority are going female because Male Orc is trash.
---
I agree, I never saw it once in vanilla (to my memory) but now we're going to be flooded with them. Feels fresh :).
---
If you have a specific one in mind, we can verify the behavior for it. Data may be more incomplete for quests which people can't pick up on the beta in the 31-60 range.
---
meme will probably be dead by then though?
---
How is is it petty if you know before you roll on it that this is a server you cant stream on?I really dont get that.  
---
If you want to stream the majority of the servers will be open to you.
---
I would say it's more petty to get mad. Because you cant stream when you rolled on a server you knew didn't allow it.
---
It translates to a tiny amount of extra healing and regen that in practice doesn't make a difference. The only nice bits are the reputation bonus and the self heal. But even the self heal is questionable - it is basically just an extra potion every 10 mins.
---
I‚Äôm keeping myself busy by moving houses for the next 2 months. I‚Äôm packing 1 thing in a box every day. By the time it‚Äôs all boxed up and into the new house classic will be releasing. 
---
I haven‚Äôt really worked out the logistics but.. it‚Äôs gonna work.
---
Yes i am.
---
Sorry for annoying you, it was just meant for a constructive debate, no harm intended. There's so many factors to take into account, but overall, opposing faction shouldn't affect your class choice if it's what you really want to play.

You cant hit the gong during those 5 days...
---
Zug zug!
---
Fear Ward made ony and magmardar easy mode for alliance back in the day.  Fear Ward was not made as a core priest ability until TBC.  So for classic, only Darf Priest will have this.  It was pretty solid for pvp as well.
---
unfortunately it will not come for classic u can join their discord
---
Got it.   
---
What build do you intend to use in classic?
---
&gt;  lvl 60 priest who's not a dwarf was a waste of leveling...
---
It's not. Topic has been covered extensively, and I don't want to repeat myself yet again, so I'll put it short; FW is nice, but it isn't needed for every raid spot. Humans have Human Spirit, which gets better with increased stats (and as the game progresses, fewer encounters require FW). Human priests are *fine* to level and raid with.
---
This is how I imagine it will go.
---
tons of guilds with their main raid set. 40 slots taken before release.
---
Release happens and people grind.
---
A month later GM realizes he has 33 level 60s and 30 are DPS.
---
2 months later realizes half of the raid is pretty incompetent.
---
Good players and officers leave and band together with other guilds to make better raids.
---
things settle around the 6 month point.
---
Guilds find good players who lagged behind and speed gear them.
---
Good players now help push content.
---
This is pretty much what happened to me. Although this time I will be going pretty hard off the start.
---
I'm on the same page as you bro, but with the OST. 
---
Storm wind, and A Call To arms... FUCK ME brilliant, both have a build up and big crescendo that takes me allllllll the way back.

Ah Undead Warrior was my main toon in Vanilla. Good times good times.
---
Am rolling NE Hunter, sounds amazing!
---
Ahhh okay
---
Oh duh, the main release date post. So much info shoved into my face that I forgot about that one lol. Thanks!

This is in exactly the same vein as them not changing the mail stuff.  Pure QoL, and have 0% effect on gameplay.

Yeah, when I posted, OP hadn't responding to any comments yet, so I though they came here for good faith discussion.  Turns out they were actually just publicly patting themselves on the back for being so cool by not being pumped for classic wow.
---
Play like you want. I will be burning to max so I can then help our friends and family guild level and start recruiting for Raids.
---
its mostly that you are coming of as a jerk

to quote the big lebowski
---
"am I wrong? am I wrong?"
---
"no Walter you're not wrong you're just an asshole"
---
Yes. Completing the quest gives you the scepter that lets you hit the gong.
---
Having few people in a server of thousands getting free gold will in no way affect the economy, that's like saying if 5 people buy gold on a server the economy is dead.
---
Torn between mining/engineer because PvP and Herb/Alchemy but 100% doing tailoring/enchanting on my Warlock tho.
---
So it looks like the realms are actually all just down maybe? I checked the big streamers and none of them are playing currently... hoping for it...
---
The big three:
---
1. Rank 14
---
2. Winterspring Mount
---
3. Pirate Rep
---
Honorable mention to the skeleton horse mount in Strath, it's rarer than the ZG mounts.
---
That's actually a good shout.
---
There was a video of a hunter(shadylol) on zenedar EU doing the same thing, believe it was deleted over the years and they changed the way arcane shot scaled I believe and it was useless after...but he did do some insane damage with arcane shot
---
I'm not overly concerned 
---
Because there will be people who quit because Vanilla is not for them
---
Because there will be people who quit because warrior is slow/hard to level
---
Because there will be people who quit because there are is too much Warrior competition for raid spots
---
Because they will quit because they won't stand a chance vs mage (who I expect to be very popular)
---
Because they will quit because they have watched R14 or AQ geared Warrior pvp vids and realize they can never put in that much time and effort 
---
TL;DR I expect a good 60-70% of Warriors to drop out for w/e reason 
---
Realistically there are gonna be like 20 warriors who are known on the server for being good and the rest will be no names
---
&gt; If the consumer isn't entitled they are quick to be taken advantage of.
---
On one hand, I agree with this sentiment. On the other hand, being full-on aggression toward the company delivering you the thing you want seems really weird to me. 
---
It'd feel like if folks attacked Blizzard if they suddenly announced Diablo 4. Actually, you almost certainly will see that from the PoE folks disguised as concern-trolling, so maybe it isn't so weird after all (people can't get over the salt in their system).
---
I planned on playing as a priest this time around as I've never done it. We'll also have a warrior and a hunter in our group. With that in mind I planned on going Tailoring/Skinning, and I know leveling those in Vanilla will take more time than the last time I played.
---
Not gonna lie, I don't understand half of the acronyms in these responses. How do PvP raids work? How long do the long PvE raids take? Are there any specific things I'd have to fulfill before participating in raids?
---
Servers are down for maintenance.
---
Meta doesn't equal mandatory.
---
Yeah when I hit 30 I did a few gear runs and finished a few sets of quests but didn‚Äôt turn them in. Then started to level alts. No interested in the lvl 30 meta. Won‚Äôt have it in launch. Time better spend testing alts and professions. But now that this is out I will be grinding to 40. 31 will be pretty quick.
---
will this reasonable be done in the week of being available? Meaing only 1 person per raid can get teh scepter? Only 1 drop from nefarion..
---
As stated in the above, if you maxed out the amount of gear, plus supplemented, you're still looking at a perfect pull of around 16 weeks (plus time prior to initial Raid 1) to fully gear up that full raid. This is ignoring BOE epics that can be looted and purchased, but still average. That's if no one leaves that raid or they aren't also gearing up secondaries, plus that would mean **perfect** pulls, fitting every slot evenly.
---
Same. Going really slow at the moment at level 21.
---
is the darkmoon neck better than choker?  Or better than the other options UNTIL choker?  
---
Is it worth getting rid of t2 5 piece for the chest in ZG?  Or maybe add the t2 wrists i assume when replacing chest for zg one to keep 5 piece?
---
Ask your friend / family that works there?
---
Top 3 of f&amp;f have been invited.  If you are below that you probably have not been invited
---
I like the Human and Gnome Racials pretty equally, but I find the idea of playing a Human in a fantasy game to be so boring. I actually don't mind Gnome, except I am kinda worried about being dismounted in puddles, and not being able to cast over hills sometimes. Lol.
---
Looks like most of you are missing the main reason most people want Classic so badly....
---
It‚Äôs not that the content of TBC and WOTLK was good or bad, it‚Äôs just that the way WOW has worked is that there is no end game- nothing really to really grind for- sick of the feeling that after hours and weeks and months of play time to get ‚Äúend game gear‚Äù for a new expansion to come out and all of that time spent grinding for said gear and max level etc etc felt wasted.  
---
That being said, new/additional content for Classic is one thing, but just knowing an expansion is around the corner just makes grinding for todays BIS gear literally pointless because in 5lvls a uncommon item will replace it.... 
---
Add to this- if TBC gets released, you know that sooner or later WOTK will be coming and so on and so on and it is literally just an endless cycle to get back where we are today.
---
(This is all imo)
---
Yeah, it makes me sad that they bring realm groups stuff into classic. It makes queuing up for BGs quicker, but it destroys the feel of server community.
---
At least we won't have the dungeon finder and will be isolated from other servers for the rest of the content.
---
Cross-realm stuff fixed some issues for later expansions, especially faction-balance related stuff in open world PvP, but it wasn't worth it in my opinion. A lot of the server faction imbalance was created by Blizzard themselves, when they started offering paid realm transfers. If you were Alliance on a server with a lot more Horde players, you'd end up paying 20‚Ç¨ to transfer your character to an alliance-heavy realm, and vice versa.
---
What they should have done instead, was merge servers together that had heavy faction imbalances and low pop. But paid realm transfers is easy money for Blizzard.
---
This is the spec I like to use when going Prot in vanilla:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AvDBATAFzxfTE0A
---
I like improved revenge because the stun effect from it does not share a diminishing returns with any other stun effect. It's a great use of rage and in some cases allows you to swap over to another target to start getting threat on the secondary while your dps burns the stunned target down. Some bosses can be stunned too so it's a bonus there. Concussion blow is super useful too, and you can chain a concussion blow right after an improved revenge to lock down a mob even further.
---
I usually don't take anticipation because you typically get enough +defense from tanking gear. The armor from toughness provides more consistent mitigation. Last stand is a must for "oh shit" moments. You only need 1 point in improved shield block since soaking the extra hit is the important aspect of the talent. The rest of the talents in prot increase your threat generated, with shield slam being the 31 point instant attack from this tree.
---
Cruelty from the fury tree is a must, as crits increase your threat and rage generation.
---
From arms, improved parry for extra mitigation (plus you swing faster after a parry, which = more threat,) improved heroic strike for more HS spam on fights that allow it, Tactical mastery will allow you to swap stances and use mocking blow / thunderclap when the times call for it, and anger management gives you passive rage generation while in combat. 
---
It's a well rounded spec and you can tank any raid with it providing you know the encounter and you have the appropriate gear.
---
anyway you can make it with just the splash colors and not the bars/races?
---
Lol like blizzard would give an official way for people to ask questions like this. Their email would be spammed by thousands of desperate nerds.
---
Warlocks become Gods at 40

Just when you thought you got out, they pulled you back in.
---
It‚Äôs a really annoying. Also the other day I saw a Druid that was some how exploring travel form.. he was running at travel form speed while still being able to cast spells. Very broken.
---
Very true. I did server firsts on tlps. Always required to have xp pots.
---
Theres other differences as well. Poison line dots were reworked... i think all dots generally. Necros are still getting a revamp(daybreak doesnt care lol) Monks have damage tables from live. Unhanded is best overall generally. You never use weapons besides specific ones each xpac early one. Classic requires sky fists for example.
---
They have instanced zones as well because of population issues. The instanced raids came after my guild controlled every raid mob and no other guilds ever got anything.
---
Classic WoW right now is authentic besides us all having the knowledge from the past to have it easier now.
---
I think he's implying the server pool may be too small to miss them all. Also, the streamers have said they're gonna hide on what server they're on for as long as they can. He may not get the option to know where to dodge.
---
I can totally see people rerolling because they get rekt in STV between 30 and 40 lvl tbh
---
How about you know... contacting the F&amp;F?
---
if you are recruiting before release you are 100% considering the raid comp and inviting extras so that you can settle into a core group.
---
My understanding is that most people can‚Äôt get TF and so they start fury tanking for more threat. If you can get TF then you don‚Äôt need to go Fury and can give your guild the extra survivability that Prot affords
---
St vietnam
---
I also think that
---
But first you need someone with the mallet.
---
It‚Äôs more of the disdain they seem to have towards their consumer and fan base is why I feel this way. They are doing it purely for the cash like all their decisions in this age. Old blizzard would make what they would love and what they knew their fans would now it‚Äôs what‚Äôs the best buck.
---
it's no different than a guild that funnels all their resources to the guild leader, or your friend who's been playing for years giving you 1k gold for a mount on your first character
---
if u want a legit fair equal opportunity game it can't have player to player trading
---
correct, it means most effect tactic available, so people do the meta if they can, if they cant they take what they know, which is deep prot warrior
---
[i have almost the exact same SN. Also from an ancient photobucket.](https://imgur.com/a/mst5SeE)
---
Ok this I cant wait for!
---
Yea it benefitted then back in the day to keep people focused on what they were doing more to enjoy their time. Don‚Äôt think it was anything like them doing it to trick you into playing more. With the amount of time and effort it takes just to get through even the fairly early quests or activities, especially with traveling in the early days. Looking at the clock every 2 minutes might get discouraging and make you feel like your wasting time instead of investing it into something that pays of eventually lol
---
Maybe some site that implements [waifu2x](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x)
---
just because streamers may or may not take handouts doesnt inject gold into the economy at all, it doesnt remove any either. and if you dont want to deal with it then just dont play on a big streamer server, if you play on one its going to be a totally different experience compared to servers without big streamers.
---
WF doesn't proc off SS in 1.12

I mean raiding and bis gets solved before raids even hit live servers. What is your point?

---
As someone without the ability to devote more than 30-45 minutes of time to anything right now (newborn), I'm so excited for the next wave of classic dungeons im going to be able to slowly watch on youtube from the level cap raise.
---
4-5 people seems grossly optimistic. More like 1-2.
---
You can't underestimate the amount of time it takes to farm Brood of Nozdormu rep without being able to use AQ.
---
Retail PTR.
---
They were never able to tank in progress raids. Alt raids when outgearing the raid hard.
---
The questline becomes available as soon as phase 5 starts. So you do the questline while turning in materials.
---
i guess thats possible, i just cant wrap my head around a guild that doesnt farm TF but has threat problems, and yet can make fury tank work (which needs healers to be super on point as well as the tank)
---
I treat attunments as achievments in classic
---
SM travel time is obviously for Alliance only (hence why I'd be running Stockades).
---
If your server actually completes the war effort week 1 then yes. unless your guild can do multiple raid clears a week with alts. 
---
I doubt too many servers will actually finish the war effort that quickly since there really isn‚Äôt any need to rush.
---
I personally love it because stalements are impossible to happen. In wsg.. Kill me
---
Thanks. I hate it.

Looking for old mates from BYOPS guild on Daggerspine.

---
Hey you, yeah you with the fedora on and the neckbeard.  Suck a fat dick, ya' loser.
---
I hope they do timelock servers. Maybe reset vanilla every 2 years. Offer transfers to a BC server. After another 2 years, offer transfers to a WOTLK server. That's prob what they are going to do. That content is not dead. But no to new stuff.
---
ironic
---
Same, some of my best memories of wow were in early AB. I found it much more enjoyable than the slog fest of WSG, had basically a time limit to it, and I enjoyed the strategy of it.
---
Always felt like a MOBA with wow chars with me, it was fun as fuck!
---
Seriously bummed out that we have to wait till phase 4 for it :(
---
so basically guilds will fight over who gets to bang the gong, since it can only be 1 of them? Unless they have been practicing 20 manning BWL and then only 2 can get the scepter
---
cool
---
In terms of pvp, it is never solved since your  battling other people who never does the same thing as another player in any given scenario vs preprogrammed pve
---
Spotted
---
Moonglade '06 in The Venture Co. 
---
Look it up ^^
---
A 25% xp boost is hardly p2w. There isn't anything available in the cash shop that would make you more powerful than someone who didn't have it that isn't available elsewhere in the game.
---
Any healer will have a place for any raid group.  But Fear Ward was busted back in the day.  With just a 30 second cooldown, it was broken for Ony and Mag, plus was insanely good in pvp as well.
---
You would be trade aesthetics for probably one of the most broken abilities in the game.  With that said, I really cannot imagine any guild not taking you for not having fear ward.  Since it only had a 30 second cooldown, you only need 1 dwarf priest in the raid.  Additional was just greedy.  But then again, Horde progressed through vanilla just fine without fear ward at all.  So, its whatever.  If you really hate the RP of the dwarves that much for priest, then just play human.  No one will give a shit either way.
---
Absolutely fucking not. In certain cases, whole servers had to cooperate, on both factions, to get the quest done in a timely fashion for ONE person, and it certainly wasn't done in a week. Mostly this has to do with the difficulty of farming Brood rep and finding book pieces for the blue scepter shard.
---
 ecause Baristolth of the Shifting Sands doesn't turn into a questgiver until the war effort actually becomes available, you're not able to actually farm Brood of Nozdormu rep. I suppose you can farm mats for the Arcanite Buoy used to summon Maws for the blue shard, but beyond that it's literally waiting and farming.
---
After playing through vanilla as the weird body shapes I'm all in on femorc this time around. No more naked/bony joints, no more ginormous shoulders...
---
Hello, join the Discord and have a chat with Nymis he is Guild Leader and can answer any question you have.
---
&gt; I doubt too many servers will actually finish the war effort that quickly since there really isn‚Äôt any need to rush.
---
im sure every server will have a guild that wants server first and good ranking and they will rush.
---
however this still means only 1-3 scepters per guild

Weapon DPS doesn't matter for Druids, only the fishing skill. Druids use claw attacks so they can't take advantage of their weapon's DPS.
---
Did all of SM. It was a great run. Really good pulls and excellent kiting by the two hunters in the team. The Esfand pally spec was also great utilizing all the defensive cooldowns to keep the team up during the boss fights
---
Shamans around 14 % and mages 13% for horde. But hey man, you do your way and keep telling me how ‚Äùmath works‚Äù lol. Dumbass
---
I play fem orc for my horde shaman and everyone in my family men and women included are over 6' lol.
---
My favourite wow machinima, always has been. The guy that made it was bloody talented.
---
Also just realized I didn't answer your question about off tanks. To be 100% honest, I off-tanked as a 31/20/0 PVP arms spec lol. I used tanking gear for mitigation and a sword in my mainhand. Sword spec procced a lot, which gave me extra rage to dump into heroic strike. I also used a shield spike and had shield block up every time it was off cooldown for raid boss encounters that required me to OT instead of DPS.
---
Honestly I'd take skinning and tailoring. Vendor the skins as you can and tailor away until you can make bags which will be golden. 
---
Once you hit max level, I'd go bs / engineering.
---
i understand it as the war effort is independant of the scepter?
---
and nefarion is the only bottle neck that allows 1 person to continue on the quest per week (from a guild)
---
Seems like we got baited. :/
---
I don't want to claim it's your BiS. It's just very good. The workable alternatives are the epic Leather gloves from MC, Distracting Dagger or Mugger's Belt both from Dire Maul. And KT drops a nice +6 swords sword, but that's pretty useless seeing as it's endgame.
---
That said, it's probably BiS for threat gain.
---
I too was briefly in until they took the servers down a 2nd time after the cap was increased. I can no longer can log in
---
nop
---
Personally I‚Äôd love to have had beta access.
---
But, if I don‚Äôt get in, which I expect, it‚Äôs not a big deal for me.
---
Do I want to get in the beta, and grind to 30, just to have to do it all again in a couple months?  Not really.
---
I‚Äôll follow posts/watch streams here and there, and not bitch and moan like the majority of people who feel theyy should have beta access.
---
Remember, it‚Äôs a beta, it‚Äôs there for testing
---
Not every F&amp;F is literally a friend or family.  Sometimes it is a friend of a friend of someone that used to work at Blizz. That's my situation roughly.
---
&gt;Streamers have audiences that quite literally give them everything they need, and an endless supply of gold to go with it
---
This is a baseless assumption that I would deem false, and your entire argument is based on this assumption being true.
---
Cool,  thanks.
---
Contact your friend is only Option, it is suposed top ,3 to be invited but currently only top 1 seems in.
---
Also If you got added recently, there might be a waiting time. A lot Reported they had to wait a week after they got added.
---
Is there a VOD
---
If you‚Äôre casting fear they can prematurely pop it to prevent the minor CC they‚Äôll experience. It‚Äôll be for the tryhards that think they‚Äôre getting an edge but don‚Äôt realize they actually suck.
---
Human psychology is such that ppl will start blaming raid composition, specs, gear and so forth. When everything is equal you are more likely to get a raid spot as a dwarf priest or a paladin then as a resto druid. I am not saying you will NOT get a spot, I am saying it will be much easier.

---
 [https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)  is probably your best bet.  Looks like there are a couple other members of that guild on there:
---
Kubaku, Mordorek, Buckbo, and Olyntik
---
Yes Fury tanking is a thing. There are two types of fury tanking so it is important to differentiate them. There is normal fury tanking with a sword and board, just using Bloodthirst instead of Shield Slam, but getting at all of the important mitigation/threat increased talents in Prot. In vanilla this was the only viable MT spec, as Shield Slam did practically no threat until patch 1.11 when Shield Slam was buffed and full Prot became them MT spec. 
---
This will still be a thing in Classic because even with the buffed version of Shield Slam, Bloodthirst produces more threat assuming you are fully world buffed. Of course this means that if you die you lose this advantage, so it is best to have one tank Fury and one full Prot that can both MT. 
---
Dual Wield Fury will probably still be a thing, but it is still too soon to say. People are overestimating the impact of parry haste, as it is only a 40% hast boost for the remaining portion of the attack. So if you get parried will the boss is at 2.4 on his swing timer, he will hit you at 2.46 instead of 2.5.
---
I did some post 30 quests (big game hunter chain, Desolace Centaur chain, Goblin Sponsorship chain) but I have every quest from Gnomeregan and Blackfathom Deeps not turned in yet, so I'm hoping they cancel each other out.
---
Deadmines had lore going back to Elwynn Forest too.  That makes it better than the build ups for both WC and SFK.  Though, I think SFK was a bit better of a story than WC even though WC's story brought you all over the barrens.
---
I can now confirm my beta access was indeed a mistake.
---
I am sad.
---
You can make it through any raid without druid? Cool.
---
You can probably say the same thing about every class in the game. Maybe prot warriors are needed, maybe tranq for a fight here and there, but in general I'm sure that's true for every class. Not much of an argument there.
---
Why do you care so much?
---
But I don‚Äôt understand it, everyone is like me.. aren‚Äôt they????
---
Glad that people enjoy a dungeon quest guide. I'm currently making a website with all dungeon quests including links to classicdb etc. I will post it here once done ofc.
---
You need Brood of Nozdormu rep before you can get the quest to loot even the scepter. The only way to get that rep is farming the bugs in Silithus. You need to kill some absurd amount, something like 25,000 (elite) bugs.   
---
If you have an entire raid group of players helping you, (who receive nothing because all bug parts are handed to a single person who gets all the rep), then it still takes several weeks for someone to complete the reputation farm.
---
Tis a vengeful economy!
---
I‚Äôd be more interested in brackets based on the Vanilla timeline (2004-2006)
---
* 14-19 would be people who were 0-6 (non-players)
---
* 20-25 would be people who were 5-12 (kids who would‚Äôve just been fucking around)
---
* 26-31 would be people who were 11-18 (teenagers, played during formative years)
---
* 32-37 would be people who were 17-24 (college students)
---
When it's actually a product and ready to ship. Quality tested and stable.
---
Honestly took me almost an entire week just grinding gold back in December 2004. There was no server economy yet since everyone else was broke and saving up. I'm sure I picked a shit place and didn't really know the best spots, but I farmed the gorillas near Booty Bay for their grey drops which seemed to vendor for a decent amount.
---
But to really give you an idea of what you're looking at here...
---
Loot table for the level 41-43 Silverbacks had you getting some combination of Gorilla Fang (67c), Coarse Gorilla Hair (6s 8c), Tuft of Gorilla Hair (11s 31c), Large Fang (75c).
---
If you average those prices against their drop % per kill, you'll find that my average Silverback kill would get me around 5.1 silver.
---
That means roughly 19.6 kills for 1G, so 2,156 kills for 110G.
---
It takes a long fucking time to kill ~2,150 gorillas. Say you average 20sec per kill between travel time, downtime, combat, and misc shit...that's close to 12 hours of play time just grinding coin.
---
Again though I'm sure there's somewhere way better to do this, we didn't know shit in Dec 2004.
---
Thats racist bro

When you open the gates doesn‚Äôt really matter if you‚Äôre going for server first, but I suppose people may feel compelled to open it as fast as possible so they don‚Äôt miss any raid lockouts that people on other servers will have. 
---
Seems a bit silly to rush it when so many people want a shot at the mount though.
---
If you want raids and gear play BFA. If you want community and fun times play classic. Does not matter what you will be doing you can always have fun. BGs, Raids, Dungeons, World PVP.
---
That all sounds so amazing. Thanks for the read!
---
Looking forward to the EOTS beta unlock
---
Can a guild willfully just farm a TF though? I thought it was insanely hard to get, and that you could grind it for a year and still not have it
---
So if I'm understanding this correctly:
---
- Step 1 hit 60
---
- Step 2 wait for phase 5
---
- Step 3 start quest and farm prof mats
---
- Step 4 someone hits the gong after everyone gets enough mats
---
- Step 5 bitchslap the gong
---
- Step 6 profit
---
It's called "get out of your mind and into your life" and it has been incredibly helpful for me personally :)
---
So if i were to level as feral, how/when would you prioritize establishing a resto set of gear? I'm guessing I will need to hang on to gear for both specs all the way from 20-60. correct?
---
If anything it‚Äôs no different than someone playing AH Goblin and building a massive stockpile of gold, mats, and items. People donate stuff to streamers so they can play the game and entertain and not have to spend time farming in world/AH. It won‚Äôt crash the economy.
---
Also, wether we like it or not, Streamers are good for the future of Classic, because it generates interest. Donations in game frees them up to create cool content to generate more views. More views, more money, more incentive for Blizzard to continue doing work on Classic and other stuff like it.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be a problem tbh.
---
I hope it does burn down some of the hype, plus private servers have been out for a very very long time, so getting close to the experience was already a thing, and tons of people did stream that and made videos on it, etc.
---
Hype isn't a bad thing, but hype dies down over time either way.

Apparently so squire

Well it was the first time I saw Sapphiron and C'Thun inside Stormwind but I guess that's an everyday thing to most.
---
Nothing just think it's interesting you want to main a human but your flair says horde.
---
Millions will disagree with you that video games are not art.
---
it's for testing purposes, it's implied it will be removed.
---
Ooof
---
same... was almost done making my toon... servers went down... now they are back up and my access is gone.  feelshorribleman
---
I kept my virginity because of Vanilla WoW
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve witnessed many high end streamers check their mailbox and personally seen hundreds of thousands being grabbed.
---
as a warlock gnome racial is more useful against more classes than the human one in pvp at least.
---
6 months I resubbed for when I saw you needed active sub for beta, oy vey
---
Nope, my main‚Äôs name is Up and has been since BC.
---
Take booming voice!

They all know Payo and love the guy, it's all troll my dude

yea aux is much better

yo the same exact thing happened to me. if you put in a ticket or anything let me know what they say
---
Pendulum of Doom and windfury will be quite fun. I can't wait for the lucky proc and crit montages.
---
I knew something was off when I was able to access the alpha server so I can't say I'm surprised :\
---
In my experience, playing a gnome tended to incur an obscene amount of punt attempts from rival horde players.
---
Arathi testing starts Thursday, they will also be closing WSG the same day. Level cap will be raised today 6/4
---
I'm surprised so many people picked BRD to be honest.  Is it because it's the first dungeon with "end game" loot for most players?
---
In retail where gold is meaningless and nobody really cares about the game?
---
This guy Classics.
---
Rank 11 is nice cause it‚Äôs a 100% mount without the skill. Think there are only 3 ways to do that in vanilla. (Might be 4, not sure what the carbs mount is).
---
Frost mage. Pew pew you can‚Äôt move or hit us.
---
Honestly, this is pretty bad but it's not far removed from what I see on some streamers doing BFA stuff. Granted they usually accommodate a facecam but I typically see shit all over the place on their screens, especially smack in the middle, to the point it's hard to see what's actually happening.
---
Eh, at the end of the day, the difference isn't going to be 'that' massive.  If one warrior has 300, and the other has 305, but all other pieces of gear are essentially the same, then it isn't like it is going to be a 10% difference in damage or something. 
---
I'd like to see this in actual practice, because I'd be surprised if it was even as high as a 2% difference, assuming both warriors played exactly the same.
---
It can but only via brokered means
---
is it possible that in and of itself is a bug? i've seen posts on here of people in beta who went beneath the map/under stormwind
---
Cool story. Didn‚Äôt need all the details, but good for you dude.
---
Welcome to classic. Leave pserver at the door.
---
I like OP's story better.
---
This is if you want to min-max out the arse. WoW was made for casual players and raids were cleared with sub-optimal groups and gear all the time.
---
Besides, there's always [Rhok'delar](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18713/rhokdelar-longbow-of-the-ancient-keepers)...
---
Unless you're in a hard core progression guild or trying to be the best at 1v1 then just play what you want.
---
Probably have to do an actual phase 2
---
&gt; contains all important information about every dungeon quest in classic for each faction: start and end location, level, prequest chains and also rewards. Not sure if Atlas addon will be working at launch but this is really well made. Maybe it could help you to enjoy the leveling experience more, most important guide for me so far.
---
It entirely depends on what your goal is. For a lot of people dungeons are a fun adventure that they look forward to while question with the chance of some nice loot. In general, the exp rate isn't as good as questing but does that matter? In my opinion the leveling is the best part of Classic (and this is coming from a raid leader who ran a guild through Ulduar in Wrath). Personally, I would do every dungeon even if they didn't give me any exp.
---
Then I'll tell you more in depth. You get an item from a website such as https://classicdb.ch/?item=727. Click the "in-game link" and copy the item string it gives you. You get something like this 
---
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("\124cff1eff00\124Hitem:727:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0\124h[Notched Shortsword]\124h\124r");
---
Of course you can adjust the name however you want, if you want it to be a believable item just add the corresponding suffix. Then there are the 8 0s in the string, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0. The first one is for enchants, and the 2nd one is for suffixes (of Agility, of the Monkey, of Frozen Wrath, etc). If you input the corresponding ID for those suffixes it will change the item in game. So we will use https://wow.gamepedia.com/SuffixId to view every available one and https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EnchantId/Enchant_IDs for enchant IDs. 
---
Say we want the item to have 91 ranged AP, we change the name to "Notched Shortsword of Marksmanship", and edit the 2nd 0 to be 1741, the ID for 91 ranged AP. Then the 0 string looks like 0:1741:0:0:0:0:0:0. If we want to add a frost damage enchant to it change the first 0 to 2268. Then we have 2268:1741:0:0:0:0:0:0. Put it all together and you get:
---
/script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage("\124cff1eff00\124Hitem:727:2268:1741:0:0:0:0:0:0\124h[Notched Shortsword of Marksmanship]\124h\124r");
---
In-game it looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/YOnBzOB.png
---
Here's a bonus: https://i.imgur.com/WIqxOSL.png
---
If they do that, then where do the changes end?
---
If itemization gets changed, then why not specs to make them more viable?  The list goes on and on, and the entire point of classic is to make it reasonably authentic... I feel crap like layering is already pushing it.  Last thing we need is a core change to the gameplay itself.
---
I mean I guess it was kinda cool to get 1 shotted by all these bosses they spawned in. I‚Äôm probably just salty about only getting into the stress test and not beta.
---
K i'm done arguing with you , you are plain fucking stupid xD.
---
There are least 4 classes whom if they are not present you literally have no chance to ikll bosses. Won't reply to any further bs from you.
---
I'd do a Deadmines if I was on Alliance.  There are like 5 quests there which makes it worth it.  It'll suck if you get stuck in a bad group though.  A lot of people quit before level 30 and usually everyone is a bit better after that.  Deadmines and WC runs are painful though.
---
83 days 12 hours to figure out what class I want to main and which class to duo with my friend.
---
Lets say I want to level a warrior with blacksmithing and engineering. It is virtually impossible to do so unless I have a higher level character feeding it gear and gold. Plus if you are on a PVP server you will need to have a high level character to protect your low level character.
---
I‚Äôd take the new animations only if it were possible (it‚Äôs not); the new animations are killer
---
You could do rogue/druid. You'll still both be able to stealth but a lot of added utility and heals.
---
Okay, let's not make assumptions without anything to back it up.
---
I don't consider Mages particularly hard to beat as a Shadow Priest either way (not to be dismissive, we just hard counter them via PW:S/Silent/Blackout Procs + Dispell + high damage potential). The biggest thing with a Mage is to force an early Ice Block so Cold Snap has to be too soon, and they get less value from it (because not everything is on cooldown). Typically this is via Dispell (for Ice Barrier) + Rank 1 SW:P (+Shadow Weaving) + Fear = which will often cause them to Ice Block to clear the fear + dots.   
---
Warlocks: You have to consider that you'll be CCed between Mana Burns. They aren't just going to sit there and do nothing. Drain Life/Siphon Life in particular won't always break a fear, which means they can be recovering significantly during CC. Plus Death Coil's heal and the healthstone. Warlocks as a class don't really distinguish between mana and health like other casters, so Mana Burn isn't significantly more valuable than just going straight for HP itself. I'm not saying it cannot work, but it isn't like a Mage or Marksman Hunter where after OOM they're just useless.   
---
&gt; Druid/Hunter: I do not see them as big problems, maybe I'm underestimating them.   
---
They're a pain in the butt. They aren't going to kill you, but you also aren't going to kill them. And it is annoying to have a Druid/BM Hunter Pet sitting on you while you try to Mindflay. I don't consider them a problem, I was simply just pointing out that Mana Burn has limited usage against a half awake Druid or a BM Hunter.    
---
&gt; Once you have enough experience, what build do you intend to use in classic?   
---
Build depends largely on priorities. Disc' PvP and Holy PvP are good. Shadow PvP is ok but sucks as alliance due to WotF/Rogues, but you are a strong "anti-caster" class.   
---
An example Shadow Build might be:   
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/A8H3EAAFM59Ol9A    
---
 - Yes, "too many" points into Shadow Focus but realistically you may PvE on occasion (+AV mobs), and Spirit Tap rarely procs in PvP.    
---
 - Imp. MB for the burst. Burst is important against healers/Mages, and your MB CD does impact it. You take too long and they could get a full Greater Heal off or similar.    
---
 - Shadow Reach is just awesome. It makes it harder for people to kite you, easier to pull people into combat, etc.    
---
 - 4/5 Shadow Weaving due to diminishing returns.    
---
 - Imp. VE isn't amazing but still slightly better than two more points into Mental Agility in my view.   
---
 - Many people do 2/2 Imp Fort and 0/5 in Mental Agility. I respect that, but Fort gets dispelled far too frequently in PvP, it is better choice for PvE however. Mental Agility is powerful considering how many instant casts you spam (SP:P, VE, PW:S, Silence, Dispell, etc). I've been known to go 3/5 in Shadow Weaving and 2/5 in Mental Agility too.      
---
 - Meditation is like Spirit Tap but all the time (no killing blow requirement). Far better talent, since it isn't situational.
---
i keep telling all my friends i‚Äôm gonna turn into the boys on south park when it drops and this just made my day
---
Yea dude I get how you feel, if I couldn't make any good arguments I wouldn't want to post either.
---
He just did.
---
I don't feel the difference is enough to warrant concern either way.  Yea, a couple races are going to make better warriors for straight DPS or TPS, but what kind of % are we talking on actual raid bosses?
---
I call shenanigans !
---
Amazing video! I dont know why, but it felt like the library scene from seven
---
Not when EVERYONE is in the starting areas.
---
Cool resource! Thank you!
---
Fantasy typically makes for a better story
---
Gnome Warrior is not uncommon because of Escape Artist in PvP. 
---
Female Dwarf anything tends to be rare, save maybe Priests.
---
These are the numbers from a Wayback capture of WarcraftRealms in March 2006, I could only get the default census of players 10-60 (but they were majority 60):
---
```
---
Druid   420105 (9%)
---
Hunter  722517 (16%)
---
Mage    549388 (12%)
---
Paladin 326240 (7%)
---
Priest  464948 (10%)
---
Rogue   659797 (15%)
---
Shaman  254603 (6%)
---
Warlock 438124 (10%)
---
Warrior 702444 (16%)
---
The distribution is a bit different there than on pservers these days. But I suspect the meta will be quite a lot different too.
---
I haven't been in any betas before so the events were pretty new and fun for me
---
No time limits was the best part about epic AVs, most of the people complaining are complaining likely due to the fact they lived on crappy servers, or expected to just be given fast and easy honor win or lose.   
---
My best memories of instanced PvP in any game come from those long matches in WoW.  One AV in particular that raged for like 3 days with the bosses being summoned and killed, battles pushing from North and South, parties of rogues/druids sneaking behind lines to cut off reinforcements, etc etc.
---
Main tank prot warriors wielding thunderfury charging the raid line with every healer spamming everything they had to keep them up as to keep the enemies distracted while healers/support were picked off.  Seeing the raid group battling the raid boss as he pushed into the main objectives etc.
---
You haven't pvped till you have done a real all nooks and crannies old-school AV on a developed raiding PvP server.  This single thing I look forwards to the most.
---
Streamer privilege will be an issue for some especially in the raiding scene where a streamer usually will get top priority on the few items that drop.
---
Will it effect hordes of people? No. But many will feel the sting of the streamer with loot. In both dungeons and raids.
---
That would be a huge mistake imo. There's nothing wrong with "beta testing" the level 60 stuff in live...that's how we spent a good portion of Vanilla anyway and it never ruined the game.
---
The best thing about Vanilla was the fact that closed Beta never let anyone see the endgame. I know we've all seen it now, but still I think there's some worthwhile mystique to preserve. I don't want to see Molten Core Classic until I see it for myself.
---
From what I remember monopolies existed no matter what. I actually look forward to having an alt on a Asomngold vs Soda server. Just imagine the events those two can come up with. And I can play on a regular server if I am tired of that.
---
Yea, not many people seem to be wanting to show their bags on their "really cool" characters they "recovered"
---
Can't blame you
---
Also that ticket you showed for some reason, literally has no details in it whatsoever, so you're saying they just merged an account to your battlenet with just that info? I might try my luck in that case
---
The details are important dor the immersion
---
No one is arguing that it hasn't been "solved".  Everyone in this thread is shrugging and saying "so what? still excited", and that is why the downvotes happened.
---
That is at -15 relative weapon skill.
---
aw as sd w y p 095 2¬†- me lo ve y o u NUD E
---
What do we do now?
---
What do you mean? We play the game
---
Basically, if the instance has little to no "non elite" pulls, it's probably worth doing once or twice. IE; stocks, sm, zf 
---
If a instance has multiple packs of non elite mobs, or the travel is super far, WC, SFK, uld, Maura, then You should probably skip it.
---
Yeah money grabbing trash expansions
---
If u played Crash Team Racing back in the day then a remake of that is coming out 26th june and will be great i hope.
---
Then you shall need this
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFnCzUxLU8
---
No, this is happening now. Watch any of the streamers open their mailbox. It's wild.
---
Interesting. I dont think Inheard of any guild back in Vanilla who got more then one to bang the gong. The rep-grind involved the whole guild to boost 1 player and then go for the rest of the quests asap. You mean guilds wait untill 3-4 ppl have gotten the rep? Sounds risky if another guild sneaks past
---
I got in, almost made it to 2, got kicked, and now I can't get in but all the streamers are in.. rip
---
It is different because the scale is much larger for popular streamers.
---
haha
---
Yeah its free advertising and I understand why they do it and it must work because several companies adopted the strategy sometimes even with single player games. I still believe its bullshit to let people freely stream and make INCOME off of streaming a game that very few people have access too.
---
If you were some no name streamer and had the only beta invite key imagine how much money you could make in the next 3 months since you would be the only one people could watch if they wanted to see the game being played.
---
Broodlord Lashlayer drop Maladath with +4 sword skill
---
I've tanked MC as Fury/Prot with 1hander and shield in vanilla, worked fine. Wasn't crazy enough to dw-tank then, but did it in TBC when I was overgeared.
---
Druid is ALWAYS the lest played class on private servers.  We'll see how that transfers to retail.  No way in hell is hunter below druid still lmao.  I can see paladin and shaman being about equal though since they are faction specific classes and almost count as the same if you're looking at a breakdown.  I.e. if you half everything except paladins and shamans to account for split along faction lines, paladins and shamans are the 2nd highest chosen classes lol.
---
LETME IIIIIIINNNNNNN
---
Yea, its hard to believe that a WoW player lost his virginity, I totally get you.
---
I mean, sounds like you‚Äôre in denial. It will happen, just not to the same degree. But I digress.
---
I have played eq2 for many years and wow since classic. Eq2 is really one of the only mmos nowadays that feels the closest to wow classic in terms of acheivement and working for things, exploration, etc... it‚Äôs really awesome and rewarding! For some reason every time I resub to retail wow I get bored after like a month and log in with nothing to do. With eq2 I can keep going back to it and find new things to do.
---
The devs literally have a release schedule that gates the content.
---
Because priests are a good duo leveling class, will let dungeon groups form faster and essentially guarantee you a spot whenever you want, will be needed in bulk in raids, and even get a very cool item quest in the end.
---
Everyone now knows this, as opposed to back in vanilla.  So far in my circle of friends who are returning, we have 6 people rolling warriors, a lock, mage, rogue, and 4 priests.
---
Modern AAA gaming has rotted your brain.

---
My mage ui, bad so. My frostbolt was bound to 9 and blink 0.
---
What‚Äôs the cap on number of active quests you can have?
---
&gt;  You could get them down to roughly 80g if you were honored with your faction and got rank 3 in pvp
---
I loved this system in private servers where the honor system is implemented in phase 1. Makes PVP while leveling pretty useful for getting that discount.
---
*[redacted]*
---
You and I have a very different definition of low effort. This is a masterpiece
---
The GM told you what the "hacker" did, odd.
---
It's probably different because of being on this sub too tbh.  I would watch these polls for private servers and then at launch each server would have the same damn makeup as every single other one before it.
---
Hunters at the bottom of the list if you split it across faction lines.  They're like the 2nd or 3rd most played class usually.
---
Are you seriously comparing patch cycling to level locks?
---
godfuckingdamnit
---
Don‚Äôt mess with models in addons so sayeth the ban hammer.
---
well thats reasonable but the met a girl on wow thing
---
you laid it on to thick man
---
believably is key
---
Iost my virginity before vanilla WoW. That's how old I am.
---
Nah
---
Will fishing pools be in-game during release?
---
I can't be the only one amused when OP plays the logic card using a non sequitur...
---
&gt;I don't really understand why I've been downvoted, therefore, this sub is ruled by emotions not logic
---
Logically sound indeed :)
---
Traditional prot is totally fine always. People use fury for farming because its faster and more efficient
---
I'm probably going to skip Westfall entirely, I expect it's going to be especially crowded since it's the area everyone tends to go after leaving their race's starting zone ~lvl 12.
---
Soul Link
---
Lol in vanilla I clicked. I‚Äôll say it.
---
Why does the streamer making income make any difference? They're lucky in a way, but it's what they do lol. Theoretically, you could start streaming and spend a long time building an audience and therefore maybe get access to this kind of thing and make income from it. 
---
They're not doing you a wrong by making money from streaming the beta surely?
---
If you're a priest, doing BFD once is worth it imo just for the wand quest. That thing is good for like 5-10 levels.
---
Yeah same thing here lol JEBAITED
---
Everyone boostes one and have it ready for the war effort , in the meantime they run others or have a secondary Group running at the same time 
---
As soon war effort completes ( is a server grind and you can see its status ) , everyone gongs the gong
---
I'm with ya on WSG, it's alright, but it just never had the same staying power for me. 
---
It's a shame to have to wait so long, but AB was out by the time I got my first toon to 60, so as a result I poured most of my pvp time into that and dueling while I waited for the queue to pop. I'm gonna get some max-level world pvp in while I wait for AB to come about, this time... hopefully... if I don't take my sweet ass time leveling again, lol
---
Do you know how many will be in this for the social aspect? I "solved" wow back in vanilla and what you are failing to grasp is that the real treasure, loot if you will, is the friends you make in the process
---
This made me lol just cuz how unexpected " the gulags " was lmaooo
---
And then you look at  DÃ∂iÃ∂sÃ∂nÃ∂eÃ∂yÃ∂'Ã∂sÃ∂ Ã∂GÃ∂oÃ∂oÃ∂fÃ∂yÃ∂  tauren and you are just sad. :(
---
They were oversaturated in vanilla well before anyone know what they would be capable of in AQ40 gear.  
---
They are just the basic fight class.  It will always be the most popular pick, and now people have the added knowledge that they are the true/best MT of the game as well as capable of being a monster if you plan on being a very serious raider. 
---
Warriors were almost always the leaders of 5 man groups, because it was the only way they could manage to get a dungeon run going.  Sadly, prepare to wait much longer for groups to form than any other class in the game.

They should of at least included it as a piece of dwarf heritage armour
---
Priests are really good at leveling and never have issues getting groups at max level.  Anathema/Bendiction was really memorable for some people too.  Just having a cool endgame class quest might make more people interested in the class.  Idk, they're usually highly played on private servers.  Not #2, but still up there.
---
Not because of WoW, school, and not finding a part time job at that time.
---
Going mage just so I can play undead. Best looking race in the game.
---
Why is this a hot button issue. There were people with the same power and advantages in classic. Why would blizz need to intervene now?
---
There mounts were like 5g or some shit
---
You wouldn‚Äôt have nightfall at level 60 as SL, or you‚Äôd be giving up shadowburn. And why couldn‚Äôt you drain life?
---
Jumpy bumpy disney tauren? I personally hate the springy frolicking of horde races in retail.
---
I don't think so. Hmm I'm going to look into it.
---
3-4 ideally, so 7.5 to 10% of your raid, assume 5-4 more as dps, for 8 total, which you‚Äôll need for 4h. So warriors are 20% of your raid, and about 37.5% need to tank. 
---
I‚Äôd wager somewhere around 80% of warriors would prefer to tank, and the majority of those simply won‚Äôt tank. 
---
Regardless of your content, be it leveling, 60 dungeons or raids; in the aggregate, tanks will always be scarce and under represented.
---
I‚Äôm almost certain there is, unfortunately I cannot view it bc I am not currently subbed. But it just looks like the vanilla hood item (lower level, 30s or 40) with a gold trim on the inside. But it‚Äôs the same one the dwarf guards use.
---
All the things I mentioned are real things. No tinfoil required.
---
Camping at wowclassiccountdown.com
---
You don't really need to "spec" as a healer or tank for any leveling dungeons.
---
hey this girl likes her characters to frolick, skipping is fun
---
There's a difference between timegating so that your thin content lasts longer, and timegating to legitimately improve the game experience. There is a value in letting players stop and smell the roses every 10 levels without feeling like they're falling way behind...hell, that's part of the Classic experience.
---
In 2004 we were all shit at min/maxing leveling rates and most of us took our sweet-ass time.
---
In 2019 several hundred people will rush to 60 with the most optimal path humanly possible and start clearing Molten Core.
---
It's really not healthy for the game.
---
They're already gating all the content anyway, it's not like you can walk into Naxx the instant you're ready to.
---
Yeah but how does that make them gods? Everyoe else has the ability to farm gold and will have mounts also.
---
2008 here too... we‚Äôre late July at best... 2004/2005 got in and they would logically invite 2006/2007s before us
---
It wasn't like that in vanilla.  End game was completely filled with warriors everywhere.  Way more people are going to make it than you seem to think.  
---
It was tough to get 5 mans going due to how much competition there was, and other warriors who started a group would never invite another one.
---
Easy there grandpa.  We don't need you getting so excited you stroke out on us.
---
They were in 1.12 so, yes?
---
I loved this game as a kid!!!
---
Anilusion?  What are you hiding?
---
Hi, /u/msarsour93
---
This is not Mandela effect lol. You used to have to create raid in every bg
---
I thought you need 9% from gear at -15 relative weapon skill
---
&gt;Having 305 weapon skill increases chance to hit by 1.2%, and removes the rule that your first 1% hit chance is ignored.
---
Thanks but I already mentioned that.
---
Ok... I'll remove it. I'm being genuine.
---
By level 60 with epic gear, your average tauren had so much armour, you didnt even see any  skin anymore. 
---
A fully epic geared tauren warrior/shaman is the most intimidating race in the game.
---
I remember this.
---
It'd be nice if Blizzard created a streamer realm. Since most streamers want to leech off each other for exposure, they'd naturally be drawn to that realm. Especially since a lot of the larger streamers have said they'll be hiding what realm they join.
---
Hate train? This sub is a circlejerk for praising whatever blizzard decides to do.
---
N: Vacation - An extended period of leisure or recreation
---
I agree, unfortunately it seems we are in the minority.
---
ye but "logically " right
---
still i got jebaited and was kicked out of beta
---
I played with daggers from molten core through naxx and can say that in terms of solo killing mobs in the world its not that bad. It will teach you how to save your energy and then kidney shot so you can get two stabs in the duration of it. Gouge will let you get behind stuff for 1 stab. 
---
If you want to do a daggers "farming" type of spec  you can have points into improved ambush and 2 into remoresless attacks so you can go around getting 100% crit chance ambushes if you can kill your targets in 20 seconds or so afterwards.
---
That being said most of the farming i did back then was picking herbs.
---
You think Warriors will have to wait the longest for groups to form?
---
yeah, rank 14 seems utterly ridiculous....
---
&gt; two in the middle are? 
---
Vulture (Blue/White) and Electro (Green/Yellow).
---
There weren't players in vanilla that drew 50-100k+ crowds. That didn't happen. Sure there were players known server-wide that had a following, but nowhere near what we're seeing today.
---
It starts with items that just have low drop chances.  After thst you can farm everything and then fight a boss thats weaker than rag
---
Yep! I did it all the time on my shaman and WF can proc while in ghost wolf form.
---
I keep seeing people say this, but anyone who actually played vanilla should easily remember just how crazy popular warriors even without the knowledge of how good they truly were.  
---
Plenty of people will make it to 60 despite their class choice being more difficult to level.  We aren't talking 'that' big a difference here.  All a warrior needs to do is hit lvl 40, and it gets simple.  
---
Tanks are not always in demand in vanilla, because warriors have to start their own groups most of the time, and you never want to invite loot competition for 1.5-3 hour long dungeon runs.  
---
It wasn't until tanking actually became difficult in TBC that tanks were actually tough to come by.
---
They were introduced in 1.09 though, and since we're using 1.12 they should be.  
---
Kind of unclear whether the content rollout stuff applies to fish.
---
my account is 2004 and i don't have beta. the year your account was created does not seem to have that much of a factor
---
Green Screen
---
If that‚Äôs the case then all sports are solved too, and you shouldn‚Äôt get excited about that
---
I need something a tad more graphic than this to stroke out!
---
I agree its silly but people will rush. Ill try and get a ceasefire on my server
---
They don't suck before that, but they certainly aren't the best like many seem to think.
---
Soul link talent for pvp is op. Splits damage received with pet
---
Man I got so excited....  feelsbad
---
thats why original female tauren already look happy and innocent. If you want brutish force, you want a male tauren.
---
I never stated that they won't get gold, but like I quoted:
---
&gt; literally give them everything they need, and an endless supply of gold to go with it
---
This will not happen.
---
Coming from somebody who watches, and posts about BigBrother. l o l.
---
Am 16. I sat on my dad‚Äôs lap and played during those 0-6 years. Even did it by myself sometimes. Of course, I didn‚Äôt get far. But, I still ‚Äúplayed‚Äù technically.
---
Thats a weird way to spell ‚ÄùSL‚Äù
---
Jokes on them Dwarf has the Best Tank Racial.
---
Except they'll release the server names before the name reservations as we need servers to save names of, but sure it's *totally* not a cash grab to make people subscribe two weeks in advance before the game actually launches just to reserve names and play with the CC.
---
When I first saw this I was like ‚Äúonly 83 days? That can‚Äôt be right!‚Äù So I checked it...
---
I could have sworn we were at the 100 day mark last week. 
---
Regardless, after checking I realise the 83 days feels like an eternity.
---
Good bot
---
You saw a video of a raid on a private server with 22 warriors, where you can abuse /sit on many fights to gain 25% boost to damage when otherwise it would be impossible.
---
Gating is gating, just seems silly for you to draw lines in the sand to make fun of this guy's suggestion. The devs are timegating to keep the pace of the raiding game more in line with Vanilla, doesn't seem like such an insane notion to try and keeping the leveling pace more in line with Vanilla, too.
---
Not necessarily. I've been in closer knit guilds and progression guilds where you would be more up front about minor utility changes in your spec to accommodate a PvE/PvP gameplay, but I've also played in casual guilds where as long as the job is getting done no one would really give a shit.
---
d-do you not think undead will be the most popular?
---
Considering were 3 weeks in and theres 3 months left to the beta, im pretty sure at this point they will raise the cap to 60 before its over. All the streamers will get to clear MC and Ony and do all the dungeons before anyone else gets a chance to even play the game. Well played blizzard, well played.
---
Aw ye forgot about that!
---
100k crowds no but they don't have 100k people giving them things lol. There arent even that many people on a server.
---
yeah but the corpse run isn't so bad there. They are so centralized. Whereas the Barren, it's such a bitch to run back and much more targets to grief the leveling crap out of them. Also priest, so MC off the elevator as well 3:)
---
Have you considered Warlock as a class?
---
It's a similar (actually much more tanky) pet class, that relies less on movement/positioning.
---
I personally love the constant availability of movement on a hunter, but someone with your disabilities may want to explore the Warlock as they are much more "turret-ey"  You have a variety of spells, nice class fantasy, free mount (less farming required), and is one of the best scaling classes as future phases release.
---
The only downside in PvP is they are a micro-ey class which can involve a lot of keybinds depending on how hardcore/minmax you want to get.
---
Yeah.. RIP us
---
True, but there is good reason for that. 
---
Fury wins out in DPS hands down, but arms still beats out most other DPS specs/classes in the game regardless.  So why not have high raid DPS (not the best) and extreme PvP potential?
---
Two words: Timbermaw
---
Yep, for Gmail it arrived in my Promotion folder. Not even my regular inbox. Wtf.
---
At the very least I think the combat animations + sound effects are an upgrade. Really elevated how much I enjoyed combat on my warrior.
---
I'm excited for it :)
---
Ghostly strike and a spit macro.
---
Yeah I bet you were a real winner rogue back in the day lol
---
Hovering your mouse over the sun or moon in the corner of the minimap displays the time. Or titan panel for me
---
stupid priests trying to take hunter gear
---
pvp server
---
He has never rolled a hunter or rogue.
---
I don't think the LFG tool had very much of an impact.  
---
It wasn't until the dungeon finder was implemented that automatically made groups and teleported you to the dungeon that the world really felt the effect.
---
Well they're from Outlands, invaded through the Dark Portal, so yea, they're invading aliens.
---
Complete opposite for me.  I was on a high pop server and it was stupidly hard to start groups, because every warrior and their mother was also trying to find people for their own groups.  
---
Warriors were always overpopulated and will continue to be in classic, guaranteed.  It is the basic fighter class, and now people know how good it will be.
---
Hi, /u/Remzz
---
Looking at the data from a private server, the class breakdown looks like this:
---
Class | %
---
-----|-
---
Shaman | 6.34
---
Paladin | 6.55
---
Druid | 7.01
---
Priest | 9.12
---
Warlock | 10.47
---
Hunter | 12.20
---
Rogue | 13.38
---
Mage | 13.74
---
Warrior | 21.19
---
S+P | 12.89
---
The last entry is shaman + paladin which is about between hunter and rogue if you look at it on a per faction basis.  This seems pretty correct from what I've seen on other servers too.
---
Esfand was streaming from a sky box at the super bowl the other day.
---
You‚Äôre kinda sad my dude. Like really. If you don‚Äôt care about classic why are you here? Go away and let us enjoy life. 
---
Who the fuck are you to tell us what we should and shouldn‚Äôt care about.
---
Go back to crying on reddit because you think girls don‚Äôt like you because you‚Äôre short (hint: it‚Äôs bcuz you‚Äôre a prick)
---
If you change resolution size will be all right - it's that
---
praise blizzard because they increased a level cap on beta? Yeh i guess the standards are pretty low these days.
---
YOUR TANK IS TOO FAT FOR HIS ARMOR. FETCH THE BREASTPLATE STRETCHER.
---
I'll definitely do fishing, but once I'm 60.
---
Came here to say most of this. Especially that of that 24%, probably half won‚Äôt make it to 60 or stick with it. Warrior is awesome but it‚Äôs a brutal grind and super competitive to gear out.
---
...WoW also has quest chains that can take up to 100 hours to complete, and reward you with an epic/legendary.
---
I am saying warriors are forced to start their own groups because of how many other warriors are out there trying to also get into them.  
---
I was forced to lead constantly despite hating it, because it was otherwise impossible to gear up in a timely manner.  
---
If you try and wait for spots to appear, then I have no doubt it takes longer than most other DPS classes to find a group; even when tanking, you have to realize that everyone else will be too.
---
Nah, the Horde would be Americans flying into the zone on zeppelins to the tune of Fortunate Son.
---
Yep /sit when you're dpsing behind the boss is totally a thing ...
---
Fury warriors were already a thing in Vanilla, don't act like they will be mediocre dps in Classic because "pservers were so wrong".
---
&gt;  Looking at the clock every 2 minutes might get discouraging and make you feel like your wasting time instead of investing it into something that pays of eventually lol
---
Yeah Casinos do the same shit, it's slimey but I wont lie i've stood at a craps table for 6 hours before, went out for a smoke and it was dark as fuck (1am)
---
Not even close. Zero corpse runs modern mechanics and player killing power. XP pots micro transactions and instances. It'd be like if blizzard instead of taking the time to look at their classic reference client and rebuild the entire thing instead just disabled all the expansions and let you play modern wow up to level 60. EQ also had to do lots of band aids like pet nerfs because people were using a few mages to kill raid bosses. Mitigation of the mighty had to be applied to make the bosses stay alive for more then 20 seconds etc.
---
Blizzard literally said they were going to raise the level cap. It was not a question of if, but when.
---
Is that all your post was about?
---
Its 30%. 
---
But other classes pop off as well. 
---
Warriors get MS, priests get shadow form, Mages get ice barrier I believe?
---
Sports are the opposite of solved. Every game is dynamic
---
Big fucking yikes
---
well there are many options 
---
for money id go dual gathering
---
thanks for sharing very cool
---
I'm the total opposite.   
---
I much prefer no flashy animations. I see the weapon swing and this is animation enough for me.
---
And tauren have the best combat movement in classic in my opinion.
---
Wirly twirly anime lines flashing behind my weapon take out immersion for me.
---
I like that only actual magic like a flamestriking mage will have impressive animations while a warrior will have just none, because weapons do not magically start to have red streaks behind following them on swing.
---
Also combat sounds in all its bloody gory glory was best in vanilla.
---
You could he the blood splatter on rend, deepwounds and crits when a warrior crits.
---
I was wondering about that. Will people take 2 second corruption and SL? Or some variation with improved corruption
---
I‚Äôm faced with the same question and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs best to take two gathering professions to level with and the drop one to power level a crafting profession. Right now my dream professions would probably be mining engineering for PvP but I know consumables and flasks will be a huge money sink for raids. I‚Äôm currently testing herb skinning on a pserver, but the economy isn‚Äôt a reliable indicator for how successful those will be in classic. What are your thoughts?
---
Its weird youre saying that since like you i was just trolling someone sensitive.
---
Get a backbone my dudeeee
---
Mortal strike is a waste of a good debuff slot and arms is not that great of a DPS raiding spec.
---
Tauren got the worst treatment of all. Their facial movements are so cartooney it completely betrays their proud heritage. Classic cannot come soon enough.
---
This is now fixed I believe
---
What hate train? This sub is realistically prepared to praise Blizzard if they put LFR in Classic: *"I-its not that bad, its still..sorta Classic!"*. I dont think Blizzard can do anything to make most people here critical of them.
---
This sub changed from being about the preservation of the game, to a quasi r/wow circle jerk of lousy memes and streamer adoration. Basically it became what it was destined to become when enough modern "gamers" joined.
---
I am happy they are releasing Classic, and i am excited to play War3 remastered. But at the same time its kind of sad that Blizzard is now that band whose best years have passed them, and they are just playing their Greatest Hits because their new stuff is no good.
---
Never thought of it like that last part but damn yeah ‚Äúkill everything and I‚Äôll give you gold‚Äù
---
Honestly?
---
I was pretty hyped for this in the first week. Since then, I've gotten kind of tired of it. I've seen it now, and I'm done with it. Not really interested in getting to play something 4 months after other people have.
---
The complete opposite effect happened to me.
---
Exactly so how the fuck can pvp be solved? What‚Äôs the difference between a hockey game and a wsg or ab?
---
Or relocating... I love how Theramore is actually right off the coast of Kalimdor in vanilla. 
---
I still have my vanilla collectors edition cloth map wrapped up in that little metal cylinder it came with.
---
Next level troll?
---
its was a tournament that had over 100k viewers, the dude won 1.2K and he got a lot of new viewers/subs after winning.
---
I am doing the same thing, just testing out some classes but I don't plan to put in any effort to professions or gold farming because once classic drops I probably won't touch this account ever again.
---
Jodi taming quest boring as heck
---
Probably a green screen with a generic background so we don't have to look at their filthy room.
---
Who will get rolled by sl locks
---
Definitely take your sweet ass time levelling. It‚Äôs the fucking best part lol
---
Warriors that don't want to tank yes, the others will get instant groups.
---
You will have to get new addons, the wow classic client is based off of the BFA client and modified to work like the original. The crazy lua scripting, etc will not be in the game. You will also not be able to use 1.12.1 literal vanilla addons. You will need to look for classic wow addons to fill the needs.
---
I have sinking feeling that Blizzard will launch Classic with the Hunter class broken and buggy as fuck.
---
Truth. I dont think there has ever been one. Ever. Its extremely weird combo when you think.
---
Fury tanking with something like 7/31/13 will definitely be a thing and possible.
---
As for DW tanking I think the jury is out still as to whether that's going to be possible.
---
A lot of what makes it possible on private servers is incorrect boss mechanics and high availability of world buffs.
---
It actually makes sense to raise the level cap every 2-3 weeks. This way they get to test all the content they need before release without people getting bored.
---
I guess ill just keep a pair handy just in case, thanks
---
But my inner warrior doesn‚Äôt want to. I am going to be running a second account and mage/hunter are the top option for first alt status.
---
Fresh Prince for my cousin and me.
---
Sham is actually top 3-4 most played for horde.
---
Real order is
---
 Warrior, Shaman, Paladin, Priest
---
I mentioned in a ticket for something else and to give me access on the side kind half joking. and it feels like they pretty much resorted to respond to my ticket in a way that made me feel bunched in with a lot of people asking for beta access, basically another way of saying no for now. They did not even solve my actual problem until I pointed out they had not.
---
Thats because it is popular.
---
They were there in 1.12 and they're in the beta so I'd say yes.
---
It never surprises me anymore how many SouthPark references the internet can remember hah.
---
Those people know exactly what they are signing up for when they group with streamers. This isn't rocket science.
---
For 300 weapon skills, yeah.
---
&gt;Many players in the beta didn't think Blizzard would raise the level cap during the beta, even though they really wanted them to. But Blizzard listened to them, and raised the level cap, surprising many players.
---
Praise Blizzard because of worried fools. Brilliant!
---
Its logical for Joana to say that if he is planning to develop something. If that is not his motive: There are some mistakes but this addon worked for me during leveling on pservers. No alt tabbing etc. Worked like a charm with some minor incidents. But I don't know if those were because of the state of the servers or the wrong info in the addon.
---
Yes, it is a thing when most bosses have an aoe splash at some point in some fashion or another.  
---
I am not claiming they will be mediocre... but people like you seem to think they are the top DPS all throughout the game, when in reality you aren't going to stay top on every fight until you are decked out in AQ40 pieces.  So few people are going to have the time to raid post BWL.
---
And in naxx40.. you aren't going to be taking 20~ warriors, lest you flat out lose on over half the fights in that raid.  Yea, a bunch of OVERgeared warriors can go back a couple tiers and wreck the content, but otherwise it isn't as imbalanced as many think.

I legitimately see no reason to not have toggle UI option for this. I'm one of the no changes crowd but to not include this is just kind of lame.
---
the full healer resto spec on shaman is with minimum 41 points in resto and the only thing that helps your elemental dps is 5% crit on lightning spells.  as resto i would recommend not using your lightning spells unless you go the ele/resto hybrid of 30/0/21 to get natures swiftness and all of the lightning spell bonus'.  but that really is more of an ele build than a resto build.
---
if you are going full heals on a shaman, you are relying on auto attacking for WF and searing totem.  Maybe one shock per mob.  That is the only way to be sustainable with your imp restorative totems and mana tide to keep you going without drinking.  It's boring, but works.
---
Turns out PvP gear/tier 0/tier .5 are good for this since they give you a little of everything.  Strength, spell power, a little mp5 and crit.  Finding a good dps 1H or a spell damage weapon helps too.
---
No, the servers can't fit that many players, I was just speaking in terms of popularity among players, and that we're dealing with larger numbers and audiences that didn't exist back then to support someone like this.  
---
Also, why are you downvoting me for just replying?

Hunter   looking for a NA semi-hardcore, Hardcore guild.  Preferably alliance,  any server, eastern/central times for raids. anywhere from 6pm-1am est  would  work.
---
I  have been playing since  vanilla.  I was hunter class lead in my vanilla  guild and got up to  Naxx before BC dropped.  I have had top 300 kills  in BC and cleared  everything. Missed all of cata and most of mop.   Raided mythic in WOD,  and legion, but haven't picked up BFA.
---
I   know my class, I come prepared to raids and don't miss raids.  I work   hard to be the best raider I can be and to help the guild be successful   in any capacity.  I'm looking for a fun group of people to down some   bosses.  Message me and we can talk.  Thanks for taking the time to read   :)

Idk how you're going to manage that.  Loch Modan doesn't give anywhere near enough XP for 12-20.  Darkshore has a lot of quests, but on my last character I leveled up in all 3 and was still running out of quests.
---
soul link is so good people on private servers basically outlawed it from being used in tournaments
---
my sub to try and get into beta is almost up , better do something to try and keep people subbed
---
I don‚Äôt think you could realistically argue that a 3 year old ‚Äúplayed‚Äù WoW...
---
I always felt judged, by myself, looking at the clock at weird times when normal people were at work, school or sleeping.
---
We used to do this with bread 
---
We called it ‚Äúhate bread‚Äù 
---
About 10 or so of us in our guild would make alts and send single pieces of bread. 
---
You know from experience how fast you could send them on one character. 10 people doing it could send 1000 in minutes lol
---
Hate? This is the first time in over a decade I have praised Blizzard for anything.
---
I think [this comic sums up my feelings](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/12/05/inverse-traditionality) very well.
---
I'm so excited.
---
Triggered
---
Herbing alchemy works well, can make money from it and gathering herbs in ghost wolf really helps
---
Mortal Strike is one of the lowest priority debuff slots in the game, and it is incapable of pushing anything important off the boss. 
---
I am not advocating that everyone should run it, but a PvE arms spec can beat out most DPS classes/specs in the game apart from combat rogues and fury warriors.  
---
Curious, which debuffs do you think get bumped off by a MS?
---
Yes but what does it have to do with World of Warcraft?
---
Nothing I ever did in classic was for loot. I was a 12-year-old dumbshit and loved every second of it. :(
---
Hooooooooo*
---
But the outlands were part of Azeroth at one point
---
Let me in! Let meeee innnn!
---
So.. the giant red face mask thing or the spinning blades when you use CDs are fine? Cause they are also in Vanilla.
---
&gt; True, but there is good reason for that. 
---
Yeah, being a prot warrior outside of raids just sucks. fighting mobs is so slow farming mats/gold for raids is painful, rep grinding takes longer due to no damage and PvP is crap unless you get a 10-man roll group in WSG and you run the flag. Back in my Vanilla guild we had like a dozen warriors but only 2 who ran full prot spec and 1-2 others who were arms/prot off tanks. The rest were some mix of Arms/Fury who thought they could tank because they have a shield.
---
Discord busted? Need a warlock?
---
You should edit in loads lowbie corpses around each of these.
---
The new gun sounds are awful, though
---
Engineering is really good for shaman because they have no other form of hard lockdown or gap closer.  At least if you plan on doing PvP.
---
I seriously wish this sub made topics like these reportable. They do not create meaningful dialogue. If you don't like streamers, don't play with them. If you are on a server with them they do not dominate every facet of gameplay available. How is the described scenario any different from someone back in the day buying thousands of gold from gold farmers? One person having lots of stuff or money does not an economy make. This is such a non issue it hurts. I think all of these anti-streamer threads all boil down to some perceived slight felt by the poster. Streamers are avoidable, yet the ones who feel so wronged by them give them the most attention.
---
Hey I‚Äôm stoaked for classic again and I play apex legends. The gunplay and movement in apex is fantastic, even if the devs suck
---
they had to, else pvpers wouldn't swap to the F R E S H server I'd bet (or people would bitch and moan)
---
The only one that makes sense not being on any map is Pandaria though, since the fog pretty much protected it from outsiders mapping it.
---
It's interesting/weird Blizzard never even put some generic landmasses in these areas just for the fantasy of it, even if they're not labeled, or if they knew they would change.
---
Reminds me of Pokemon back in the day, every time a new generation would come out, it would go from "150 known pokemon in the world" to "300 known pokemon in the world" and each time there would be stories about how people in these regions grew up around these newer pokemon so they've been effectively retconned in each new generation. Clearly someone who made maps, would have drawn up a vague landmass for things like Northrend! I mean there's a map in Warcraft 3 isn't there?!
---
More fanart like this? Amazing!
---
Everyone needs to change the time in 
---
&gt;var countDownDate = new Date("Aug 26, 2019 18:25:32").getTime();
---
to the release time local to their own time zone.  I.e. for east coast US you change it to "Aug 27, 2019 03:00:00"
---
Isn't that the one that also auto-repairs your gear and auto-sells gray items when you visit a vendor? Not game changing by any means, but convenient.
---
I lost mine before Vanilla, but then, through playing so much Vanilla, I got it back.
---
üòÇ
---
Hahah so much no change autism
---
Have you tried not playing the game?
---
Lol the no changes crew is faltering
---
I don't see how that wasn't in the spirit of Vanilla. For most of the game, Shamans/Druids/Paladins had nothing in the ranged slot until they decided to create librams/totems/idols.
---
Those items were just randomly inserted into existing loot tables.
---
Many specs have viability dependent on single items that they acquire early in the game.  I do like the idea of a bit more gear progression for some specs like feral.
---
Still looks like crap.  Also... it isn't impossible that it will stick going into release, mainly because it could be a side effect of porting down the BFA engine.  
---
Time will tell I guess.
---
Yup. I can barely stand to check this reddit because it gets me too hype for a game 3 months away still. SOOO LOOONNGG
---
All I have to do is look at my little gnome warlock roaring in gleeful rage as she sucks the life from some hapless victim... and I can't agree with you more.

Some people don't follow streamers. Granted they are not likly to get into a group with one when most followers are frothing at the mouth to group with thier favorite one.
---
Scarlet Monastery 
---
The *Whole* experience was pretty awesome back in the day. 
---
Making the journey from southshore through horde territory. Trying to get enough people there to summon if you could. Battling the horde just to get *into* the dungeon. 
---
Having not 1 or 2 but **4** choices of dungeons in one central location. All of similar theme but were diverse enough to be a unique dungeon experience. The scale of it was immense in a good way (without feeling too big). 
---
The loot table full of goodies. Especially as a Warrior. Armory was a dream! The scarlet set was so cool. Good looking armor with great stats? After mismatching gear for 30ish levels? Sign me up.
---
I ran that place so many times. Alot of good memories. I am excited to just enhabit that place for awhile.
---
Although i am a bit sad because i wont be going through as a Warrior this time. At least not at first.
---
At no point in time was leveling gated in vanilla...?
---
There were no life try hards and super casuals both on launch day in vanilla...?  
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from but that second part of your comment doesn‚Äôt make any sense. 
---
Leveling pace more in line with who?   
---
I think time gateing levels is retarded. He doesn‚Äôt.   Cool.
---
Auto sell grays, auto start quests (great for escorts), auto complete quests.
---
Was it /u/WolfieAllie1 ‚Äòs virginity?
---
What was the bug before? I didn‚Äôt hear about it
---
Was a banable offence back in the day, you could use it to give yourself an unfair advantage in situations by removing textures or making some things stand out more for example.
---
Durotar. It was the second zone I ever saw in WoW, first on my own account. I love the zone for being the home of my favorite race. I hate the desert wasteland and I live in one so I really don‚Äôt want to see it in games I play.
---
My build? lol
---
Blizz dont care about EU players, all they care is about our money
---
Standing in IF and spamming "60 Prot Warrior LFG \[RAID\] has \[X\]/8 Might/Wrath set" seemed to get me in groups rather quickly back in the day.

The good part about /sit is that you control when you get crit. Having lower defense leaves it up to RNG.

Keep in mind that if you choose blacksmithing you can't use sharpening Stones or weightstones on your weapons because your spells like rockbiter or Windfury overwrite them.
---
I was busy alt-tabbed to thottbot
---
Nope. Outlands are the shattered remains of the planet Draenor, from which orcs come from. A completely different planet from Azeroth. Warcraft lore can at times be weird.
---
Not every single account from 2004/2005 got in beta, BUT no one from after 2005 has gotten into beta. See what I mean? 
---
The only confirmed non-streamer instances of invites thus far has been 2004/2005 accounts.

It's why rolling need in a boe should bind it to you.

On the other hand tanks and healers get the express lane for dungeon grouping.

Damn, I just imagined that and its the coolest shit xD

[This](https://clips.twitch.tv/SillyEasyAmazonTriHard) is what it looked like before the patch today, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm2cFtFVROw) is what it should look like.
---
It was very much an "on-rails" flightpath that wasn't authentic.
---
Electro is quite the psycopath, no sane person would get out with that mask and demand people to fear you.
---
So you quote conditional statements I made, which are true, to attack a strawman you created (that I think druids are **overall** better MTs than warriors). Nice. 
---
Your laundry list operates under the mistaken assumption that a bunch of unrelated minor advantages all have the same weight. They don't. Take, for example, pre-raid BiS phase where a druid can produce significantly (lets say 10%) more threat than a warrior who does not yet have TF. Both are capable of reliably surviving the encounters. Obviously in that situation having a second taunt or being able to eat healthstones isn't going to mean shit compared to a 10 percent higher threat ceiling. 
---
Are druids better here? Yeah. 
---
Are druids overall better MTs than warriors? No. 
---
You need to learn to read before you sperg out for hours attacking an argument the other person never made. You clearly were not familiar with these resources or the meta, and since you weren't familiar with Skarm and your first classic post was a month ago you probably don't play on pservers or haven't for very long. Between that and you referring to druids "pulling off" main tanking, as if druids tanking raid bosses is an unusual occurrence to you, it suggests that your experience (if any) was mostly in vanilla. The fact that you think druid tanking videos are noteworthy (they aren't, most high end pserver guilds run a feral OT) heavily suggests you are just talking out of your ass.  
---
You can't show me the private server meta because you didn't know it yourself until I showed it to you. You're just another dude that is coming back from vanilla with old ideas that got low-key woke in this thread while pretending you knew the whole time.  /thread.

The chance of this happening is smaller than grouping with some random dickhead that ninja loots.
---
Keep your bubbles, ill enjoy my wind fury totems ;)
---
You don‚Äôt see how adding items that weren‚Äôt in vanilla isn‚Äôt part of a faithful recreation?
---
The pathing and animations were way too stationary (Retail wow style) Check this post for better explanation: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bsty57/flight_paths_are_very_very_bad_in_the_beta_heres/
---
Where are you getting this info from?
---
As much as I love vanilla, I have to say that the tanking system was so flawed.  Trying to tank as a raid geared prot warrior in 5 mans actually got harder, which is another reason why so few people could stomach it.
---
They love me in that tunnel
---
You think you dont see shit, but you do. The thing is when you have stuff near the center of the screen its better to see your character while looking at other stuff at the sime time. Stuff like cooldowns i always have more towards the center.
---
Because it allows blizzard to pick and choose how the average person sees their game. Do you think they would give keys to a streamer they thought might have a negative view of their product? No, of course not. This is already a major problem in games journalism since companies only give out keys to reviewers that will say 10/10 best game ever.
---
Its not as if its a personal wrong its about the concept of a fair playing field. I view what they are doing as nepotism.
---
It was always so cool as a small undead shambling between Org Bank and AH and seeing huge armored cows on their massive Kodo mounts.
---
You should be able to download the game around 3 weeks before launch to create your character.  Addons will be out by then and you can just paste them in the folder.  Then you can set them up when you log in at launch.
---
You don't need a ton of UI addons and a bunch of crap at launch anyway.  I'd just put in cartographer, extended quest log, a quest addon, and bagnon.  Those don't need any config and will get you going for like the first 20 levels.  You can set up crazy unit frames, action bars, postal, and auction addons later on.
---
Ya it‚Äôs not a problem. At least of pservers. I used it on K3 till I quit there. We were up to Chromagus in bwl.
---
Dang. I haven't seen that video in at least 12 years now. It's so good.
---
I agree with you on this. Paring the functionality together in an add on seems fine as I get the connection but the name wouldn't make sense anymore.
---
On that note, a 5 second timer in similar fashion would be cool overall
---
I started WoW in Wrath so I‚Äôve never experienced vanilla and I‚Äôm pretty sure the pserver I tried was a wrath one too (with heirlooms). So I guess maybe I have some wrath nostalgia to view the game pre-cata again, but mostly I want to experience the content I never played before. I don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs old or whatever, it‚Äôs something completely new for me.
---
You mean guns don't sound like wet farts
---
I see you are also lvling a warrior.

"Half way to half way" is my go to

One of my daughters met her partner through WoW, TBC I think (does that count?)

Three kids later I am assuming she isn't a virgin. üòÉ

Can someone copy the contents of the post here? At work.
---
You can see the red streaks left behind a swing when you use whirlwind. I do understand your point though. I might be coming from a different place though, as I didn't enjoy the human male animations as time went on.
---
Yeah it can lol 
---
I‚Äôve loosely kept up with the lore and assumed Draenor was on Azeroth
---
Damn lol, ty!
---
You referring to the rage generation issues when you basically stop taking damage? Just swap down a couple items to lesser ones, they will be cheaper to repair after too.
---
My vote was for Sunken Temple. It's one of those dungeons on live that is a shell of it's former self. Some of the dungeons were split up like Stratholme and BRD, some were revamped like SFK or Scholomance, but ST was just gutted for some reason. The original had so much more to explore and even had a hidden boss who isn't even in retail anymore as far as I know. It also had the sense of adventure getting to the dungeon like many classic dungeons had. Climbing up this massive temple and delving into the labyrinth inside is freaking cool.
---
Turns out you're the father. Kek
---
it only happened if u had stress test, u guys get all the luck
---
Must be nice.
---
Just use Sexymaps
---
Yeah, and they ready knew about Pandaren in Classic. There is a quest about Chen Stormstout in The Barrens.
---
And I like the comparison with Pokemon...sometimes news land or pokemon just appear
---
It was! my tribal leatherworker got the patterns for the devilsaur 2 piece set and I used that as my primary income before finding that the unworked leather sold better :) I loved ungoro, as a druid there was nothing there that posed much threat and I just dug the zone.
---
Ah you are of course correct. Its been awhile
---
Do you need 5 classes or 6? Math is not making sense here.
---
All cool ideas, but I have concern this could negatively affect TBC and  Wrath classic releases.
---
I wouldn't mind them taking this approach after Wrath because I don't care about the game after that, but I really ... really want TBC and Wrath classic server options.
---
hey man you aren't supposed to apply logic in here
---
Now if you could just program the level up or quest complete sound to play when you finish a task
---
Sorry I guess I dont know how to link the talent builds.
---
Only because The Simpsons are timeless.
---
1.2k is chump change. Made more in TTD calls today
---
Keep in mind this is from the Hard-core crowd on these forums. I think a lot of people expect there to be a lot of new players that roll dps so they want to roll the best healing class that levels easily and gets groups easily. It's responsibility but not as much as a tank would have, and not as difficult to level or get raid spots.
---
I'm more curious to see how many of these classes are on either faction though. In general I'd assume there'd be more healers on Alliance as it's always appealed more towards that classfantasy of being a good looking humanoid welding the power of light.
---
 But we'll see. I kinda want a poll showing faction/class.
---
im suprised this many people all wanted to play wow together but wont raid or play on a pvp server.
---
Also im not sure how it isnt obvious that you should play tank, or tell your warrior buddy to tank...
---
Blizzard ops: shit why are 10000 people playing in the Beta right now?
---
Ffffffuuuuuuuu
---
Yep, i noticed it right away. Good on blizzard.
---
Ya, I spent a while without a guild in Vanilla and did this for groups.
---
Dude your PC has a clock
---
Why does everyone keep putting all this stuff in Google docs spreadsheets?
---
They're so annoying to navigate on mobile.
---
uhh no they don't
---
They do deserve more praise then they have been getting lately but it‚Äôs not because of the increase level cap on beta.
---
I only played MC/ony back in the day, this will feel like an expansion for me :D
---
&gt; Well yeah? That's basically what I said. A lot of people place value on that.
---
That's not a good way to look at anything. Especially when that value isn't going to be equal across the board. 
---
&gt; You are projecting and failing to understand that some of us don't really care about proving how skilled we are in a mythic raid.
---
No, I was giving you examples to measure differences with, which I suppose I either didn't word properly, or you don't understand? 
---
&gt; You are only seeing this from your own point of view of 'this isn't mechanically challenging so it succkss'.
---
See, this is an example of projection / strawman. I never said that. What I find interesting is trying to figure out just what it is you find appealing about Classic. It's not difficult raid encounters. It can't be what your class can do because a lot of classes spam one ability. I've really not been able to find anyone who can explain what they like or defend what they like. I'm starting to see that there's almost no factual reason why people like Classic, it's almost entirely opinionated. 
---
Which is fine, you know. It's OK for someone to like something. Although it's kind of weird for people to turn around and then say, "Classic was the best WoW" when it is objectively not true in any capacity. 
---
&gt; Modern wow is indeed more about skill than gear, which is why they absolutely shower you with it so easily. Some people like this, some people find it boring.
---
Being measured by your abilities is more boring than getting a couple of pieces of gear (maybe) a week? 
---
&gt; Neither skyrim or deus ex are an MMO, so don't really know why you're bringing it up.
---
Because you said, "but those who want RPG's with character development want classic." Classic barely has any RPG elements to it. It's simply not that kind of game. 
---
You're kind of just saying words and phrases without knowing or caring if they apply or not. You're letting your emotions dictate your thoughts on the game, and clearly I've approached these discussions incorrectly. I'm coming from a rational and logical approach whereas most people I talk to on here are coming from an emotional and often purely subjective outlook. 
---
In which case, the poster can't really be "wrong" since it's not wrong to have an opinion or strong feeling about the game.
---
If you were raiding and mark stacking happened, it could be from the hunter T2 debuff. They have the same icon. Also, at least from comments I saw on wowhead there was mark stacking at some point but it was a visual bug and didn't provide any bonus AP.
---
I made this for my soon to be 60 horde warrior in classic =D
---
Well done picture
---
Per faction it is though.  Way behind.
---
This is pretty much what I was going to say. I did this in vanilla. Transmute CDs can be a decent money maker too.
---
In original vanilla pugs were almost non existent.
---
Hmm shaman might be the best healer as its the onl one that gets an interrupt.
---
Priest+paladin might be good too as BoW would be golden and mana burn a way to handle certain healing mobs. JotC would also benefit smites.
---
I agree pushing out versions constantly wouldn't make sense, but they would be smart to occasionally push versions bc you never know what bug you fix will cause more problems unexpectedly.
---
Don't you need 9% with 300 weapon skill?
---
https://i.imgur.com/FWlac2Z_d.jpg
---
You take paladin?
---
I find it interesting that weapon skill is not that good on PS, because theorycrafting back in vanilla always made it out to be the best stat you could gain up to a certain point.
---
Up the resolution on them and its perfecto.
---
well he made classic
---
Maybe they added it to test if the clock works?
---
i didn't even get a cock tease and i was in the stress test
---
Sorry on mobile pain to fuss with a link.
---
Just YouTube asmongold am cath and it should come up.
---
Thank you so much for the Hunter one! Looks great. I really like that you are making options for everything so everyone can customize the appearance how they would like it.
---
It doesnt anything for lock/pally mount
---
I was gonna mention that in my original comment that it may have just been a visual bug (those happened a ton in vanilla). It wasn‚Äôt from raiding that I recalled it though.
---
Asmon, Esfand and Themechanic98 were all streaming all 3 runs I think, so they should all have vods available.
---
My favorite was the /sit macro for PvP fun!
---
Fishing/alchemy/herbalism. Making all the gold even in full resto.
---
If you‚Äôre going to play with a Druid rogue is a decent bet because double stealth is a lot of fun.  On the other hand that group is lacking a tank.
---
I level fishing as I level. It doesn't take that long to grind out. The only thing that sucks is finding a good fishing pole as alliance.
---
Well, you can scrape together 30-people after raid night is over, and go knock out the 'encounter' portions of the quest in like an hour. You can even get people to do chimaerok's because they can get meat. 
---
Try convincing people to help you farm bugs for several days. Probably why 100% of scepter-holders will belong to loot councils.
---
Technically, your chance to miss is 8% and level 62+ mobs just ignore your first +1% hit making the +hit% cap 9%.
---
Hi, /u/MrPeakyBicepsMan
---
Good question! To make sure join the same guild and you will be in the same layer.
---
The more I think about it, the less I want Beta access. I don‚Äôt want to be burned out by the time Classic officially is out.
---
honestly, people raging about beta testers getting a leg-up just make the whole classic Wow thing feel super authentic.  Back in the day beta testers (in lots of games) got a lot of shit, and even got called cheaters because they had a chance to learn the game early.
---
I made this for my tank main I plan to play in Classic!
---
What sort of player base do you have? I'm early 30's, family, etc. I'm trying to find a group of similar people to play with.
---
There are. This also includes greater sagefish and the cooking recipe for them (on vendor in Orgrimmar). Likely Rumsey Black Label also drops.
---
On a technical level, its not a bug. It was there all of Vanilla/TBC/WOTLK/Cata. Now should it be patched and CHANGED from the original state? I think yes. But from what the client was it was not a BUG it was a FEATURE. Jesus christ its like you guys don't know what definitions of words are.
---
That's exactly how I feel. I want to be that motivated to no life it for a few weeks.
---
If I spent 3 months going through the beta, it won't be the same feeling when we finally all "go home".
---
Change the blonde hair to grey and orc males into human females?
---
What is this?
---
About tree fiddy
---
herbalism + engi does well. Or if you are not so much into pvp then herbalism + enchanting is a very strong combo because it can be used to 2man farm DME with a warrior. If you find a big dick fury warrior with mining and you are a herb+enchanting shaman you will be make buttloads of money in DME and that's without even needing enchant recipes,but if you become the guild enchanter you get those and you can make gold while jerking off on reddit aswell and help your guildies with any enchants at the same time.
---
Hey man any update with that source? Also, drink some water. :)
---
So I will sell Cloudkeeper Legplates for 3k and watch Asmongold do a begathon until he can afford them.
---
I am currently about level 22 on Pserver, all green gear i found leveling, daggers the whole time. 
---
2/2 Remorseless
---
3/3 improved gouge 2/5 improved dodge 3/3 improved Backstab
---
3/5 malice.
---
I fucking love it so much more then combat, 250-300 Ambush crits @ roughly 45% chance with Remors active, and about 85% Backstab crit with it active if my ambush opener doesn't crit. 
---
I cant wait for kidney shot.
---
People didn't know enough in 2004 to really tryhard, there was one or two people on each server who managed to ding 60 within the first 3 weeks, but I don't remember anyone being actually able to form groups for Strath, Scholo, BRS, etc., until weeks after release.
---
If they were to gate the leveling process then it would be much closer to how the servers progressed in Vanilla.
---
I kind of think WoW Classic will be off to a bad start if people are already killing Molten Core bosses on the 2nd week. The world's first Molten Core boss kills and Onyxia kills happened 2 full months after WoW's initial release...and closer to 3 months for even pretty dedicated guilds.
---
The lack of knowledge and lack of other rushing people is what made the leveling process so good the first time around, you took your time because you didn't know any other way.
---
should we have more mega-threads on this sub to clear up a lot of repeated questions?
---
If you plan on doing 5 mans, but don't have a tank I think the answer is fairly straight forward. You may not want to roll another druid in case the resto druid ever wants to try feral (avoid rolling against each other for gear) but you could seeing as you also already have a warrior. Can't play pally because you are horde, so it looks like prot warrior.
---
As fishing schools will from launch getting those wreckage pools for free pots will be quite handy. Future alchemist may also take the alchemy schools while for cooking many fish may be used to boost the skill and then vendor.
---
LoK'tAr OgAr
---
Finally! 
---
Love life r/freefolk and Bobby B !
---
Hunter or mage. 
---
Hunter right up there in leveling speed with druid and neither of you compete for gear or are gear dependent so the majority of time spent with your wife is melting face and if she heals and you get a good tanky pet you cover all roles for leveling, grinding or questing. You in fact dont compete for gear with anyone that way and are a phenomenal addition to the 5 man group you have while being able to do great in relaxed pvp. Your hunter tiersets are phenomenal for pvp also so its not like you have to have multiple sets. 
---
Of the ones you mentioned as front runners mage is by far best choice. Having a party member with infinite food conjuring and portals while only splitting gear with the lock is fine. You also bring the absolute strongest aoe farming/leveling hands down. Mages are useful in absolutely everything and are welcome to just about any raid/group.
---
Collective anecdotes and confirmations from both /r/classicwow and the official classic forum when they poll an ask beta testers when their original accounts were made. 
---
There has not been a single instance where someone from post-2006 has reported getting invited thus far. You will not find one in any of the threads. That is just a fact if you search. 100% of the time they report their account age is 2004 or 2005. The only exception I‚Äôm aware of is big-name streamers like Pokimane (a big Hearthstone name and didnt have a vanilla wow account). 
---
Additionally it was originally anticipated from the original announcement which came true evidenced by the current beta account ages. 
---
&gt;	While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you‚Äôre in the running to join the test it doesn‚Äôt guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.
---
Does this mean I am saying 2006+ have no chance whatsoever until august 27? No, and I hope more get in. But 2004/2005 age been exclusively favored thusfar for non-FriendsFamily invites/streamer.
---
Stress test client had it all although it was also "reported" so there always may be some changes before start.
---
Knowledgable people dont turtle-farm WSG though. Anyone who's going to even be semi-tryhard in ranking up in pvp knows about vanilla's honor decay system. In short: the more often you kill a player in a short amount of time, the less honor they give per kill until it drops to 0 honor per kill. This goes very fast when you farm only 10 people.
---
Tryhard pvp'ers are going to be trying to cycle through as many bgs as quickly as possible because turning in the marks of honor gives the most &amp; quickest honor gains.
---
I noticed the morning after the stress test i still had it in my launcher. It only went away when I decided to restart battle.net
---
Hi, /u/Cokezone17
---
Pffft real big ugly damage. 
---
Troll female = thicc model = thicc damage.
---
Yeah. Not thrilled. :(
---
What are you talking about? They were there up until Cata. If you don't believe me go to youtube for 10 minutes and look at the videoes of people doing it. They are in Cata gear. They are Draenei. They are in WOTLK gear. It was not fixed in 1.12...... But even with all of this being said, I think blizzard should CHANGE the client. YES I AM FOR A CHANGE OMG ITS THE END OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I stand by what I said
---
Lots of things were in 1.12 that aren't going to be in from the start. It's a weak argument.
---
In the current beta you are able to change your character name.   
---
This can be done by deleting your character, having someone else grab your name, and then recover/undelete your character. As your name is now taken you will be forced to change your character name.   
---
Here's a VOD-link of it happening during [Ziqoftw's stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/434351744?t=03h08m37s). 
---
While he didn't do this to intentionally change his name, it can be used as a loophole to get a free name change. 
---
I don't know how this works in retail, but it seems odd that your name becomes available immediately while you still are able to recover the character, especially given that name changes are not supposed to be available in classic wow.
---
Great read, very relatable to so many people here, thanks for sharing!
---
Grab a dictionary
---
If I was running a BG group with a warrior/druid/warlock/shaman, I'd want a priest in the group for dispel. I'd also accept mage, but would be happier with the priest. 
---
(I'm not a warrior expert, but pretty sure you want to be arms for PVP.)
---
The thing is I still have it.
---
If you actually read the testing from the link posted by OP, you would know that the only thing affecting your opponent's parry chance is the raw level difference. So unless warriors have a way of magically becoming level 61, they will have to deal with 14% parry bosses just the same as druids.
---
OK got one, now what
---
Nope, it's because of this part:
---
&gt; and I decided to ditch WoW 
---
Right after BC released? No way. :x
---
A troll is just a night elf that survived the abortion.

My god the memories this video brings, 12 year old me found it so deep
---
**ENGINEERING** for PvP for gap closers and stuns
---
**ALCHEMY** if you are going to be raiding.  You make consumables which are always in style through the lifespan of the game and there is a lot of money to made selling people Greater Fire Protection Potions and flasks.
---
**LEATHERWORKING** is best left to people who wear leather.  If you do decide to do LW, keep in mind that Dragonscale is absolute garbage and no one should every waste their time.  Take either the one that makes hide of the wild or devilsaur gear
---
**BLACKSMITHING** is ok if you are going to be an weaponsmith axe crafter.  some decent axes to sell to people.  (nightfall is usually requested regularly by enhancement shamans/offtank warriors/hunters with the worst job in the raid)
---
**TAILORING/ENCHANTING** because why would you take tailoring unless you were just using it to make crap to DE.  some enchanting mats are always in demand as long as people are upgrading their gear.  If you can even do those enchants, better yet, you can just sit around Org and spam your services for tips which can make some decent money.  People will also regularly purchase MP5 oils and Spell Damage oils although the best ones come with ZG rep.
---
cool down related materials are decent sources of gold.  When you don't need them someone else does and their value only goes up the closer we get to Naxx phase.  (you need a ton of these things to make your tier 3.)
---
alchemy -&gt; transmute arcanite
---
leatherworking -&gt; cured rugged hide
---
tailoring -&gt; moon cloth
---
So because now we're not retarded we should just be leashed?  In your mind that's how it should be huh?  I mean at what point do YOU draw the line in the sand?  
---
I guess everyone has their own opinion.  Thank fucking god blizzard does not mirror yours lol
---
It's amazing how *dense* the eastern Kingdoms are compared to Kalimdor.
---
there was one good use for summoning stones even after the tool was added, summoning your raid in to stormwind via the stockades one to go kill the king, guess the alliance could do the same with RFC but never saw it
---
Wonder if obsidian edged blade out dps bonereavers for 2h fury...is the importance of weapon skill markedly more notable than it's importance on private servers?
---
you basically started saving at 30. if you stayed away from the auction house, and saved pretty much all of your money, you could save around that much by the time you reached 40.
---
Played on the stress test as a warlock, can confirm pets are extremely bugged.
---
clipped screencap to exaggerate? I'm sure it would have looked more reasonable if you didn't clip like half of your screenshot
---
They don't have the same luminosity in their "room" though
---
This picture captures the essence of leveling
---
Um not a fookin kneelah
---
Seasons 2-14, sure
---
So do we have to buy every new expac to keep playing classic? Cause if they do official tbc/wrath i dont want to buy the newer expacs. I dont mind paying a sub though.
---
There's 2 6 slot bags that are journeyman under tailoring so you max it out quickly as well as extra bank bags. Disenchanting mats don't have an auction house fee so that alone is enough for me to make one. I've done it in the past and it was well worth it just for disenchanting. I gurantee you'll make more money.
---
GODS I WAS STRONG THEN
---
so while you guys did it. where you guys moaning your toon names or your real names???
---
His kick wasnt an attack or something along those lines.  It doesnt care about friendly
---
A rare boss in Mauradon dropped a chestpeice with the same look
---
I did... it definitely made it easier.
---
&gt;an old game - "why play that when there's a ton of better MMOs out there?
---
There really aren't though. At least none that Classic fans enjoy. Pretty much every single modern MMO caters to a very different audience than the people that are looking forward to Classic. If your friends like Destiny 2 and GW2 they're most likely not going to like Classic. And the people who like Classic most likely don't like Destiny 2 and GW2 (I sure don't).
---
&gt;has a subscription fee
---
I massively prefer a subscription fee over microtransactions. To me 15 bucks a month for tens of hours of playtime isn't a bad value proposition. Plus cosmetic microtransactions ruin cosmetic character progression. I don't give a shit what people look like in BDO, Overwatch, etc because they didn't work for how their character looks. But someone standing in a city in Classic with a full raid set always looks great.
---
&gt;seems like the hype is just nostalgia of fanboys
---
People have already proven this wrong in the beta. People like Preach and Venruki who were very skeptical or not hyped at all have played the beta and completely changed their minds.
---
I don't know why people have to blame the hype around Classic on nostalgia. Maybe it's just a good game, occam's razor.
---
I loved doing this stuff in Vanilla and TBC. In TBC I mained Warlock and joined my RL friends' semi-hardcore raiding guild. Spell haste gear was new and all the mages + Locks passed on it (at first) so I got fed a haste set pretty quickly. I decided to test it out on a Fire-destro build. At the time, the only "viable" lock builds were shadowbolt-destro or affliction. Well turns out fire-destro+haste was GOOD and I quickly became a top 5 dps on the charts despite playing a talent build that probably only 5 or less total people in the world were playing. This was pre-chaos bolt. It was basically like Dots/curse of elements-&gt;immolate-&gt;spam incinerates til last tick of immolate-&gt;conflag-&gt;repeat. The haste got you extra incinerates between conflags and helped with the conflag global cooldown reset.

in BGs, they'll have dispellers stuck to their arse 24/7.
---
Till you die!
---
You may be right.  Ill check on a pServer tonight.
---
Will they though? Having the corporal insignia seems pretty huge.

As someone almost exclusively interested in twinking, classic wowhead is invaluable with the decade-old comment integration. Easily the most accurate site I've seen when it comes to old items/quest chains/level requirements. 
---
If you get the formulas ironed out, the ability to gear plan at specific levels other than 60 and different races would be incredible. Game-changing if you will. 
---
Keep up the good work.
---
For PvE yes, but weapon skill has no effect in PvP
---
Weirdest of flexes, but ok lol.
---
From what I remember druid forms were treated like stances so you could make a spammable macro to either get in or get out of a certain form. 
---
you may need to change first form because you dont get the Dire Bear till 40
---
/cancelaura [stance:1] Dire Bear Form; [stance:2] Aquatic Form; [stance:3] Cat Form; [stance:4] Travel Form; [stance:5] Moonkin Form

Nova is definitely fine to keep Rank 1. Poly is a different story since it extends the duration quite a lot. Infra has a guide which goes over the spells to train/skip here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit#gid=916278063

/u/Smith5399 Deleted your comment already? Here was some of my response, feel free to fix it when you try again
---
You went from Druids are equal or better to Druids are equal or worse. Your goalpost is about to break at this point.
---
&gt;Your list assumes they all have the same weight
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs an inference you made in order to retain a semblance of an argument. 
---
&gt;Take, for example, pre-raid BiS phase where a druid
---
Are you illiterate? I‚Äôve said multiple times, stemming from one of my very first comment, that Druid main tanks are strictly better in this scenario. You‚Äôre like a broken sperg machine that can‚Äôt stop repeating the same trope straw men that no one cares about. 
---
&gt;you weren't familiar with Skarm 
---
I was familiar with Skarm. I‚Äôve his videos. I never bothered to watch his Druid tanking videos because why the fuck would I watch his Druid tanking videos 
---
&gt;first classic post was a month ago you probably don't play on pservers or haven't for very long.
---
Nothing you (wrongly) infer about me personally will save your argument. 
---
&gt;most high end pserver guilds run a feral OT
---
&gt;OT
---
Holy shit you need to reread my last comment. Slowly.
---
&gt;You can't show me the private server meta because you didn't know it yourself until I showed it to you. 
---
Uh, what? Wrong, but by all means please show me the breakdown of pserver **main tank** Druids vs pserver **main tank** warriors
---
Night elves are inbred trolls.
---
https://github.com/Meridaw/Vanilla-Macros
---
Nope, i have never once in 15 years ganked anyone or started world pvp. I dont enjoy it, so the only thing that has happened is those things being done to me. 
---
I did a PVP server because my friends were on it, but originally always wanted pve
---
After lunch i find time to pass quicker. And if i get an unexpected task an hour before leave that needs to be finished that day, time seems to speed right the the fuck up for some reason.
---
In just one hour, I'll only have four hours left, before I have to work a mere three hours.
---
Look up definition of minority
---
We're all a little older and the general consensus of the group is that we don't have the time coordinate 40 people or waste time running back to our corpses because some higher level person is bored.
---
The warrior enjoys tanking just doesn't want to level in prot. He'll likely switch at higher levels when it starts to matter.
---
I provided op the link.
---
If you would read up on what weapon skill does you would know it lowers you chance to be dodged, block and parry. While increasing hit and crit chance. Also look at the data collected even when you account for the variance you see that +5 weapon skill lowers parry rate. This isn‚Äôt by much but it is still lower.
---
I was planning on going dwarf hunter, but now you make me consider night elf... And imagen the havoc from All the traps aswell. Great idea mate
---
Why do you think i plan to guild lead?
---
He's not in charge of anything though. He's just streaming himself playing a video game and telling stories about his time working on the game.
---
OK, it says the black and brown people
---
Dont hate the player, hate the game
---
Ok bro you keep doing you
---
You dont need to coordinate if You join a guild
---
Also if you don't raid or pvp then w.e you play doesnt matter
---
i didn't find it hard just very long, managed to do it solo without being in a high end guild, know most of the other on my server that got it were helped along by their guilds
---
Upvoted because, fuck the Alliance.
---
Double titan panel, for those pre 1080 resolutions...yikes!
---
Well to be fair I'm using the cartman Webster dictionary
---
Classic "summer"
---
A melee hunter?
---
Disagreeing saying there is no need to praise because there is nothing to praise them for but will happily spend the monthly sub fee...lol reddit is astounding sometimes
---
I feel like OP was a FireFall dev and is pissed because his old boss is a mildly successful streamer now.
---
u have to refresh your link on "link" button on the bottom of the calculator.

Playing non stop? How else?
---
If you're wanding to regen mana, you're Warlocking wrong.
---
I keep a clock right above my monitor for this purpose.
---
Where did I miss this bit of lore?
---
there will be plenty of addons as well that will have a clock on, titan panel for example have a clock you can have on the bar
---
There isn't a single MMO that's better out there, is the thing. There's a couple decent ones like OSRS but it's not my thing.
---
I never played during vanilla so it's not nostalgia.
---
Thank you for interesting and well-presented info!
---
Shamans and paladins are the second most played class, wonder if it stays like this...
---
Could it be possible to include numbers to the age plot? :D
---
Now do one "who plans to get to 60"
---
I made 2 characters in BetaPvP server. Was booted and now no realms available
---
Do not under any circumstances play prot before 60.
---
Aug 26th right?
---
Smells like a jebait.
---
they said they added it for testing purposes, so they could easily see timestamps
---
Aren't skinning mats going to get driven down to dirt cheap prices on most servers? It seems like a no-brainer for most levelers since it's so much more time efficient compared to herb/mining, let alone crafting professions. So I'd imagine that much supply will flood the market and make leather (especially light leather) really cheap
---
&gt; Even though I didn't know this guy at all, he still was burned into my brain forever because he was standing out from all the rest with his gear and achievements.
---
This is a big reason I am against the transmog system
---
I dig thier aesthetic. I don't understand how the redo ruined it? I think my Tauren Pally looks tough as nails. Especially when he moves his mouth. Rather than weird rotten blocks of cheese.
---
At long last, no band plays forever, my subbie.
---
actually had to re-read that line as i first thought he was asking for information about that quest lol, think i need to go to bed
---
lmao epic
---
&gt; I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll cross paths again.
---
This right there is such an important thing to me.   
---
If I had the chance to change one thing in retail, I'd most definitely get rid of sharding (second thing being flying mounts).   
---
I'm so stoked people can actually say something like this again.   
---
Can't freaking wait for the 27th of August.
---
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
---
Do you have any major examples of what and why they wouldn't be? What happened to hash tag no changes
---
East coast is 8/26 6pm :)
---
Sorry I did that to ya
---
Double stealth does seem like a lot of fun but I feel like the most fun I would have with it gets limited by being on a PvE server.
---
Furry warrior will easily be able to tank any content with proper gear. Your group is missing CC in case you want to use some in dungeons. I personally think Mage would complement your group. Free food and water, Portals to the main cities for the entire group, great AOE and CC. 
---
Rogue is nice with the shaman and allows for some fun shenanigans with the resto druid (sneaking into places)
---
Shadow priest actually suffers from leveling with a group since Spirit Tap talent requires you last hit.
---
good joke
---
I'm not 100% on that. I vaguely remember that being the case but lemme go test it out to see.
---
Also unfortunatly people basing there choices off beta coverage might think warrior is op and choose them
---
However warriors being capped at 30 is when the best gear is available to them.
---
Not only whirlwind axe but a shield meant for lvl 44
---
yep. Blizzard goofed again.
---
Depending on the wand, it can be better than Life Tap + Drain Life.
---
Classic is classic.  It has its own art style that differs in many ways from BfA, and I want to see it represented as such in other media.
---
I'm going to say that bag space hasn't really been a concern, at least to people who seriously play the game, in ages, WoW honestly in a good place with inventory where, unlike their competition, inventory space is large enough that it's not a hassle to manage, but not so large you can forget about it, which is honestly a nice balance
---
I didn't downvote you... also why is the viewership relevant when the conversation has to do with individual server economy's.
---
Seriously, I feel like people are going to be devastated when servers have issues or sharding doesn't work perfectly and the starting zones are clusterfucks the whole first week. Especially considering how many people are likely to resub for the first time ever/in a very long time to check out classic
---
I said it's my opinion, what more do you want?
---
If he was a Firefall dev, he'd have a right to be pissed. Kern *begged* players to let the game fail so he could buy it for cheap. He literally begged players to destroy the livelihood of all those people employed by that game all because he's a narcissistic prick.
---
I‚Äôm personally rushing to 60 on my warrior just so I can start leveling an alt to make gold with. 
---
60 Pre-raid BiS warrior gear ain‚Äôt cheap, as well as respecs and consumables.
---
I have no idea how you played like this lol.
---
Just logged into the client - not a joke.
---
I feel like everyone wants to be a warrior this time around, or is it just me?
---
Your trolling attemps are very poor
---
What level enchanting do you learn greater magic wand?
---
Twin imps but that's about the only use lol. Thanks for the constructive discussion /s
---
Teehee
---
Five hot tips for getting vomit out of pubes they don‚Äôt want you to know:
---
Thats what I did, Its especially nice when you can addon to have local and realm time for out of time zone places.
---
I think it‚Äôs interesting people are saying Druid is fast - I played a Druid back then and it was regarded as one of the slowest due to its abhorrent kill time.  Even though there‚Äôs low downtime in cat form the damage is really low.
---
Because once the release date was announced and beta began is brought all the dick riders from retail
---
it was meant to remove the turtle aspect of WSG and all it did was made it so someone had to cap first before it started
---
My friend introduced me to a Korean mmo called silkroad online and I got distracted for a couple of years lol. Sad that I missed out on it, but I was casual as hell up until Cata so I probably didn't miss much. Hoping that in the years to come we can have legacy bc and lk servers as well
---
Sorry, I wasn't clear. The warrior will be tanking but leveling as fury. Paladin is actually my favorite vanilla class but we're definitely sticking with horde.
---
I just got an email and able to log into the client.
---
I've never understood how NEETS survive. Do you/they have disability? Or are they supported by parents/relatives?
---
THE KING EATS, AND THE HAND TAKES HIS SHIT

Wrong sub mate
---
Holy shit, I didn't know they were launching it at 12 am CEST.  I'm used to them always launching at 12 am California time.
---
almost 48hours was the longest i saw one last in vanilla, managed to join it 2 or 3 times while doing other things without even realising i kept getting put back in the same one when i got back to the game
---
1. Level as enhancement. You won't find any spell-power gear leveling, and you won't have any spell push-back prevention when enemies attack you.  
---
2. Unless you're in a hardcore guild, 30-0-21 is almost as good as 0-0-51. It's very passable as a raiding spec.
---
WoW in 2006 : We need more races, I wish we had tons of races playable.
---
WoW in 2019 :  
---
You're kidding ? They just throw races into wow now?
---
Oh boy, how much did we change.
---
Oh, cool so you saw my comment. I‚Äôm fine with that, I actually posted it and thought I would just delete it to end this toxic conversation. We don‚Äôt really disagree on anything substantive - you‚Äôre just angry and have the pathological desire to ‚Äúwin‚Äù so I was going to allow it. 
---
Everything you said rests on the straw man you created - where you put words in my mouth that Druids are better MTs than warriors. I never said that and you can‚Äôt quote me saying it. Therefore most of what you said doesn‚Äôt apply. On the rest of it we mostly agree. Stay mad üò°
---
Correct, my mistake I mis read it
---
You must be trolling. From the [link](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#weapon-skill).
---
"Target at +3 levels: 13.86% +- 1.02% parry"
---
"Target at +3 levels, +2 weapon skill: 12.17% +-1.28% parry"
---
"Target at +3 levels, +5 weapon skill: 13.41% +- 1.07% parry"
---
Did you still have Stress/Beta on launcher? Or was that deleted before you got this email?
---
It's why you see more leather workers and fewer blacksmiths. In theory that would also mean that blacksmithing items would be less common and sell for more.
---
Night elf hunter with cat pet for shadowmeld + prowl + feign death + ridiculously good leveling looking very appealing for my first (pvp server) character
---
thank you, this is what seven years of college and almost six figures in student loans has gotten me and it was worth every penny
---
I would go leather working, enchanting because you can disenchant everything in the game from level one. I wouldn't invest in a job that costs money until you have a basic rider.
---
The goal is to have fun with friends and maybe make new ones. To me, if you're trying to find the fastest way to max level you're missing some really great experiences playing the game. Do a little bit of different activities as your time permits. Do what feels fun to you. Try to enjoy the process.
---
Awesome
---
I don't think this simple of an API worked in Vanilla.
---
You can hover over the sun/moon icon to see the server time. Play on a server the same time zone as you and you're all set. Or don't and get to used "oh, this server is 1-3 hours ahead/behind" :-P
---
No need to taunt us. :(
---
Hmm, this has some missing things.  But overall a good code sample to look for, thanks.
---
Stress/Beta option never went away after the stress test.
---
Not a joke, just got mine. I am on F&amp;F, no idea if that mattered.
---
I‚Äôm also on F&amp;F!
---
Don't let the 60% off part make you buy hastily, it hasn't actually been listed as 80$ for a [year and a half](https://camelcamelcamel.com/Logitech-Gaming-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons/product/B0086UK7IQ). It's a good mouse though. I have it and love it!
---
Like I said elsewhere in the thread it came directly from an old photobucket. I found it on mobile, when I get home I‚Äôll see if I can find the full image.
---
Yes, but that always felt like a very counter intuitive thing to me.  Increasing in strength, yet making older content harder to the point of removing your strength.
---
Your opinion would have been something like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt *think* Classic will live up to it‚Äôs expectations and listed reasons why you think. 
---
But then you go off on the doomsayer shit that many people on this site do and try to pass it as fact. You then proceed to call put downvoters(lol) and call anyone who disagrees a fanboy/resort to ad hominem.
---
Holy shit I remember bagnon from many years back. I like your list because those addons don‚Äôt automate gameplay (ie auto targeting) but just gets rid of some annoyances.
---
It did for me. PTR and Live only
---
A human rogue may only benefit from putting a single point into Combat Expertise if they‚Äôre using swords or maces. It depends how weapon skill affects the higher miss rate of a dual wielder.  Thoughts?
---
I'll have a warlock alt but my mains always end up being healers.
---
To all that forget, soul shards used to go into your bags and did not stack, so lots of bag space was a must for warlocks.
---
It was for a while but they stopped supporting the old animations when they changed how the animations worked in Legion.
---
Weird - did it stay for some and not others?
---
Yes... 'test'
---
From what I remember there were two ways of making macro. The simple way like I showed and the "/script" way that allowed for more stuff.

barf
---
I miss when it was 50%. Ya purge wrecked it, but it was still so good in world pvp.

It sounds stupid but, Rain of Fire. Even though its not an amazing spell, I always thought it was way cooler than Blizzard. Its why I rolled a Warlock instead of a Mage in vanilla.

Me too. I bought it at Frys where I worked. Never went back to that job after that day...
---
&gt; I also remember that one undead mage, his name was "Pic". Funny thing back then, without cross-realm and battle groups, you would always run into the same people in the BGs, so some names just stuck in your head you know. 
---
Man, that's absolutely what I missed most and why I quit not too long after I hit 70 in TBC.  Cross-realm, meeting stones...things like that were great for convenience but they absolutely destroyed the community and world-building aspect of the game for me.
---
I remember "growing up" alongside my rivals in the BG's in vanilla, seeing the same players week in week out, moving up through the tiers together.  'Oh hey, \_\_\_\_\_ is in the 30-39 bracket now!'  I remember building a reputation for myself and getting to play with the top alliance PvPers as I made my way through the ranks.. I think I topped out at Commander.  It was a blast.
---
Then all the 'convenience' features came.  Instead of recognizing players, character names, and building relationships and rivalries it was just and endless cycle of people you'll never see again.  Instead of exploring the world, traveling together with friends to different dungeons you just queued up from some hub city without moving.
---
That's where WoW lost me

I wish we could have optional servers that have staggered level caps like this on live release.

---
Yes but i expect warrior to suffer higher than usally fall off before 20 and 40
---
I'm going to get all the usuals: ElvUI, damage meter, auction addon, WeakAuras, enemy cast bar since that isn't default. DBM at max level.
---
Although I'll probably level for at least a couple weeks with default UI for that *feel* and install addons shortly after.
---
You can do neat stuff with them. You might make a macro that says
---
&gt;/cast Nature's Swiftness   
---
&gt;/cast Greater Healing Wave.
---
Then you can press one button and get two things done. Good way to pop trinkets and so forth. People use macros to do all sorts of things. Totem targeting macros are used for squishing totems in PVP, mouse-over macros allow you to use abilities on targets your mouse is hovering over, even if you haven't clicked on the player.  
---
They're not essential for most classes, but they can make your life easier. Usually you can just steal someone else's macros, you don't have to worry much about thinking-up your own.
---
According to the other link I posted weapon skill lowers chance to be blocked dodge and parry by .04% per point (as weapon skill is the inverse of defense). Sure it isn‚Äôt much but it does lower it.
---
While I understand variance is the difference in all data collected the numbers don‚Äôt add up anyways and you see that parry ends up lower with +5 skill. Weird huh.
---
I attempted to do a lot of 
---
/cast [harm] Moonfire; Rejuvenation
---
And it didn't work. So I'm just not sure.
---
There's nothing amazing about the new models.  The Orc models aren't even close to the old ones lmao.
---
These guys aren't actually streaming because they want to. A corporation has enslaved them and forced them to be streamers. These two just happen to be the ones assigned to Classic WoW.  
---
If you go and look at other games on Twitch, you'll see the same background. It's just the design of their cell. Depending on which wing they're located, the design might be a mirrored image (left and right sides of the cell block hallway)  
---
Sometimes you have to dig a little deep in a game's category because that particular streamer slave hasn't reached high popularity yet, but you'll still see the same room design behind him.  
---
You don't want to know what happens if a streamer slave doesn't reach 1k subs by the end of his first month...  
---
Also notice the door material? It's a cheap wood. The rooms are built relatively cheap, but inside the walls there are bars so they can't gnaw their way out.  
---
Sad situation really.
---
isn't there some PITA quest tho
---
&gt;criticising others
---
Criticizing DKP
---
Because DKP encourages upgrades that are not BiS to be sharded. Upgrades that could have gone toward furthering the progression of the guild.
---
Welcome to reddit, assume the position and firmly grasp the member of the person to your right. Commence stroking at will.
---
Or can give up a bag slot for a soul pouch, either way still lose inventory space.
---
For sure. Their leveling experience isnt great without support/a main funding gear
---
Keep your feet on the ground
---
You actually highlighted why rogue and mage were my top picks. Shadow Priest's advantage is dispel and off healing. I never remember being impressed with resto druids in Vanilla but my wife is set on that so it would be help out keeping everyone alive. Maybe resto druids are better than I remember though.
---
Macros allow you to do several things with one button.
---
I'm modern wow, I have a macro that uses a healthstone (if I have one), drinks a health potion (if I have one), and pops defensive cooldowns, all with one button press.  You can make macros that target certain things or have your character say certain things (like, "about to pull, get ready!"), or pretty much anything you can think of that you can do in the game in another way.
---
Macros are not "required", but they make some things a lot easier.
---
Or there's just an influx of retail plebs coming in
---
Lock was my main for a large chunk of my "career" I've rogues since wod. I'm rolling a rogue so I can eventually get that sweet sweet bloodfang set.
---
But I am very interested in this thread...
---
Patch 1.12 used to build CLASSIC WoW include the Stranglethorn fishing event , so it is worthwhile to level up fishing and profit from this fun event.l as long as you are not on pvp server and got ganked repeatedly by enemy faction..
---
+2 weapon skill is also lower than both +0 and +5 from this data. So what you're saying is that +2 weapon skill is better than +5 weapon skill?
---
Night elf priest for shadowmeld into mind control.
---
I'm proud of the 2 yr olds playing.
---
Those 2 are at the bottom...
---
Wouldn't this be doable before? Since you could make requests for support to restore a character that you regret deleting or whatever? But in either case I feel like that shouldn't be a thing
---
Read the link I gave you and educated yourself on weapon skill.
---
I think you'd have to have a very decent wand and be stacking a lot of spirit for it to overtake, but you make a fair point.
---
Been a long wait since the blizzcon reveal. 83 more days isn't so bad.
---
Yeah 100%, edited it to reflect it. I post my build earlier but dunno why I thought I'd miss reflection when I posted this.
---
Zug zug my n****
---
You'd pretty much have to be on the spectrum to like the new models.
---
Hi, /u/xyzpqr
---
Soul pouches existed in 1.12?  I had forgotten.
---
What with the call for authors? I did send a message but didn't received any reply.... or it went to spam some time ago ;)
---
You must be fun at dad jokes!
---
check inside the box , they got guest pass , maybe still usable for classic wow ?
---
I haven‚Äôt played WoW in 10 years, but I‚Äôm excited to relive all the nostalgia I had from years ago. Excited to just explore the world at my leisure. There‚Äôs no rush for me. Just an escape to something I truly love
---
Cool dude enjoy your summer too, hopefully the fortnite kids don't ruin that for you too however unlikely that is ‚úå
---
I feel like priest and rogue are switched? Seems way off for priest being #2
---
Thats your opinion mate, Enjoy em
---
Getting from 12-20 is a combination of Darkshore, Loch Modan, and Redridge Mountains.
---
[There is a setting to disable it as well.](https://i.imgur.com/0tlkorC.jpg)
---
I tried, but could only take 9 days off. I'm playing a Warrior, I don't even know if I'll make it playing 24/7 let alone being somewhat healthy about it.
---
Many will try warrior, but not many would stick to them
---
No thanks.  Looks exactly how it needs to right now.
---

Considering how much gear gets replaced through the levelling process (Soulbound) and how much get's replaced during gearing at max level i'm wondering if it's worth doing Enchanting / Herbalism? I would imagine that Herbalism will make a good amount of money, and if i'm in a guild and need flasks making then i can get a guildy to make them using my own mats anyway?
---
Rank 2 Wind Fury and Storm Strike.
---
Shaman level 40 is real.
---
Im looking for epiceric
---
I'm unsure. I might take engineering, I've never really used it before as I've always played on a PvE server.
---
Probably going to take Herbalism and Skinning. I'll either drop Skinning and pick up Alchemy, or drop both for engineering.
---
Did he think this would get him a Beta invite?
---
I can already hear rogue stealth sound just from this picture.
---
Fishing on a PvP server is half the fun, also it raises the value of the fish.
---
Well that's why you want to get ahead of majority
---
Thanks for the overall rundown &amp; tips. Definitely something to think about. 
---
What would you rate Enchanting / Herbalism? The only thing making me worry about Enchanting is i know it can be expensive to level up.Even if i do have Soulbound gear it's usually worth a nice vendor price.
---
Or you can press it just when you get feared. With abit reaction, you wont miss much.

&gt;half the ppl here are gonna lose their jobs and gfs(lol jk) **for a game that wont last long**
---
90% sure I read something similar in 2004.
---
Yes but until you get to the point where you need to carry more shards than a regular bag will hold then you are better off just using a regular bag.
---
(Why equip a 12 slot soul pouch just to carry 4 shards when you could put those 4 shards in a 6-slot bag and have 2 more slots for anything else)
---
Surprised to see warlock as high as that

Great work team and thanks for the updates.  Will you also be adding in non-instanced rare mobs with their loot tables, location, etc.?  I'm sure that's part of the ongoing effort of data being mined in the Beta and sent back to the team. 
---
Huzzah on YouTube spun up his own client and got values up until like lvl 40 zones but I think they were based on Pserver data. For reference: [https://www.youtube.com/user/huzzahYT/videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/huzzahYT/videos)

I feel like leveling fishing while leveling is the way to go,  at least for me. I am in no rush to 60, at least on my first character, and I plan to level cooking that way as well. 
---
Another consideration is that one of your goals should be your mounts at 40 and 60. Fishing can help fund that.
---
You gotta take demographics into account. This subreddit is about 10000 times more tryhard than average. Thats why you see all meta classes
---
I don't get the reference.
---
I‚Äôm sure. Your just a casual millionaire who likes trolling Reddit.
---
Why you gotta lie my man? Your so unsatisfied with your like you gotta boost your ego to anonymous ppl who don‚Äôt care
---
Oh my god, this guy has a macro when he lands off of a fuckin flight, like a gryffin and yells "hello everyone, i am here" and greets everyone warmly
---
yup, now you cant criticise blizzard or layering or anything without people freaking out at you here, and it definitely wasnt like that before recently
---
Awesome man, I‚Äôm not in beta, but plan on playing war, and after all the hamstring and kite talking I ant to be sure I‚Äôm playing the best I can.
---
Is this like a game to see how many downvotes you can get?
---
I was young and salty
---
Mage can CC and AOE CC, counter spell, Rogue can evasion tank but lacks anything to help the healer (blind, gouge at most?). Shadow priest can help to heal and toss bubbles but you have no CC or utility.
---
I find good mage or Rogue can really do crazy things in a group where a shadow priest may be able to help off heal but that is about it. If you dont trust her heals go SPriest.
---
No Joana is not lying to be logical. He has just kept working to refine his guide. No doubt his old version is still fantastic. I'm sure you'll get amazing results from it but, it's not his final form as it were lol.

Too high effort IMO. You really gotta commit to it.

I mean you‚Äôre not wrong. I‚Äôm just saying that‚Äôs how you bait them out of it.

There you are I was trying to reply when your thread was locked. So you had Beta/Stress in your launcher (it didn't go away like others did) and just got an email? Hopefully I get my email soon too then

For #2, I'm pretty sure you could only backstab and ambush with daggers.  So that's one thing to think about.

I'd be curious to see a poll that asks if you're a new, returning or current player.

It's a matter of compromise really.

 This is it, oh baby this is fucking it! Never, not once, have I had such a golden opportunity for this; I'll be telling my children of this glorious moment to be captured for the Reddit record books. I'd like to thank my main, Sui of Realm Frostmane, Final Countdown Guild, the great Ion, and of course, our Lord and Savior C'Thun for allowing me this golden moment:
---
 WoooooOOOOOOOOOOSH
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense in reference to his comment?
---
oh man, i remember me and my buddy would roll around silithus making "chopped salads". round up some mobs now youve got all the delicious nutritious ingredients together you need to chop it up. unleash the RoF/Blizzard AoE of death.
---
sometimes youd get a little carried away getting all the mobs in a bunch and it wouldnt end well, but hey. good times.
---
Naxx isn't out on launch, the world pvp events in silithus and EPL isn't out on launch etc. etc.

Some things are actual content releases and should be gated, and some things are just game improvements like fishing and should be in game from the start.

you're probably talking about [this one](http://apikabu.ru/img/ZmJkNW.jpg)

Swords are better until you get some later raid daggers, atleast for pve. Daggers are better for pvp almost always. Mace spec is usually not worth it unless you have a very specific pvp spec in mind

Solo leveling combat spec with sword specialization talent for extra attack

At level 60 mostly combat spec with swords till very very late Nax, daggers become better.

Undead is not as strong in PVP as Orc. The stun resist is just so amazing against other rogues.

thats how mafia works.

Me too, FeelsBadMan. Hopefully its temporarily and we get access soon

What weapon
---
But it's total %, right? Meaning that in a given faction there'll be two times more %.
---
The way they worded that does not imply that it's going to be removed. 
---
&gt;With maintenance to the WoW Classic beta today, we‚Äôre going to be putting the clock onto the minimap in the **default UI**.
---
&gt;We expect it to save us a lot of time when we‚Äôre debugging using screenshots or video clips.
---
They announce that the clock is being added to the default UI, and that the addition hopefully will help them debug things. They don't say it's added for debugging reasons, they say a side-effect of adding it is easier debugging. And nowhere is it implied that is it temporary.
---
I don't have much experience with enchanting, I have heard that it can be expensive to level up. One thing to consider though is that you don't actually need to level enchanting if you just want it for DME farming. The skill requirement to disenchant items was added in TBC, which means in vanilla you can be 1/300 in enchanting and disenchant lvl60 items. Enchanting is quite essential to the farm spot because you get a lot of low vendor price blues that you sell as large brillant shards. 
---
As for herbalism, it's nice. It's not particularly hard to level up especially in the mid/high levels because there are so many junk herbs that has no value but provides easy skillups. Herbing in the world is a quite good money maker and it will always be. Though for classic with how peak hours work on region servers it might be that you can't make money herbing doing prime hours. Herbing also places an essential role in DME farming as there's herbs down there to pick up which adds up quickly.

It taunts all the pussy right off of you.
---
I hope so brother. What a tease!
---
ah, nice :)
---
Right? If I were built like a dwarf I'd just wrassle him down and have my way with him.
---
1: High combat with remorseless attacks/relentless strikes or at least just remorseless attacks.
---
2: cant backstab/ambush with sword/maces, daggers can. (I forget about the dot, I am unsure).
---
3: It's 100% opinion based. I like orc for the 25% stun resist and 1 less button to press.
---
Best tip? Ignore those who say you can front stab..you can't.
---
Get poisons around 23-25, not 20. It's too hard unless you have 3-4 other rogues.
---
SS/slice and dice is your breadwinner to get to 60.
---
If you level feral and abuse the resources correctly then it is rediculous fast. If you do it poorly its still better than most though.
---
These will be updated based on uploads from the Wowhead Client, like other outdoor NPCs. If some aren't filled in, we may be able to pull some info from Thottbot archives.
---
Ouch, but on the plus side now that you know, you'll be able to attend the next one this month :)
---
It was like that for a while but it got changed sometime during vanilla for all bg's.
---
Hence, 
---
&gt;I seriously wish.
---
Checked this dudes post history. He might be the most pathetic person on reddit, congrats!
---
Blizzard is the only one with an accurate reference client. They can take this data and test it. The burden is NOT entirely on us to prove, as that would be impossible for many bugs currently affecting classic.
---
Just use a bank alt for disenchanting.
---
Pallys do if they want to heal effectively
---
Some classes benefit more from macros especially in PVP. Basically it allows you to combine several actions into one button and when you press that button depending on the condition you set one skill will activate instead of another. Example you can put Damage and Healing spell on one button. If you have an enemy targeted it will use the damage spell, if not it will do a heal..... VERY BASIC EXAMPLE
---
To summon the hydra boss
---
I like that comparison.
---
I guess you don‚Äôt want any warlocks..üôÅ
---
Hmmmmmmmm
---
you gonna lose out on a dick ton of quest soulbound disenchants.
---
Yep
---
Cmon man...Re-releasing a game that they didn't even made (in a sense) isn't how you atone for years of questionable decisions, and the bullshit diablo blizzcon fiasco.
---
Im grateful for what they are doing, but my guts tells me that it's not out of "love" for the fans. If they want appreciation, then they better start making great games again, not gutted and downgraded brainless timesinks. 
---
As of now i don't see a difference between the downfall of Bioware and Blizzard, it's just that the name Blizzard still carries weight, but it's dwindling. All of this is of course my opinion but i don't consider "pop culture" games, games. They exist for the instant gratification portion of players, and are therefore shallow shells.
---
My boosters are gonna have me at 300 engineering / mining. Won‚Äôt need to farm gold will just buy it
---
If those formulas are right then weapon skill up to 305 is increadibly powerful and then gets diminishing returns as 300 to 305 gives you 3% effective hit chance while 305 to 310 would only give further 0.5% hit chance. Of course the weapon skill also lowers the dodge chance, gives crit and increases glancing damage but I'm not sure how much those change and if it is worth it to lose other stats.
---
lol, I know in 2004, i defiantly did not make it. Hellensdead, is still stranded some place in 1KNeedles at lvl 32
---
I‚Äôm glad you added them, i was super immersed. Felt like I was really there, watching from a darkened corner.
---
In vanilla no, on retail yes. It was up until WoD atleast.
---
Are they still separated in beta or piled up?
---
Yeah I suppose, just look at your gear like tools you don't need a sledgehammer to hang a picture just like you don't need T2.5/3 to clear UBRS.

---
https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/
---
I don't.  But I'm sure we can agree that new models are definitely and totally not vanilla in any way, shape, or form.
---
60% mounts kappa
---
1. Combat arms with riposte. Once you are 60 you want to respec out of riposte as it's a leveling spec and it's 6 talent points wasted for a dungeon. 
---
2. While leveling? The main difference is that speed matters for sinister strike. You obviously want good dps weapons, but preferably good dps slow weapons so that your weapondamage is high giving big sinister strikes. As for mace vs sword it's best to stay with swords to keep high weaponskill, and you will spec into sword specialiation which is roughly a 5% dps increase when you use swords. But if you get your hands on a sick mace that's a big improvement of course go with it. Daggers can work fine as offhand weapons, you want a fast offhand for poison procs, but obviously good dps and stats is important too, and preferably it should be a sword for the sword spec. As for leveling with daggers, it's really tough since frontstabbing is not possible. There's a hybrid spec where you basically have good stealth speed, go up and ambush, into a gouge into backstab and then evisrate. If you have good enough gear and kill low hp mobs so that this combo oneshots, then go for it, but it's very weak until you get to this point since after that you are useless.
---
3. Orc is better both in pve and pvp, but undead is pretty close in pvp to the point where I'd say it's a matter of playstyle. If you don't care about being a bit lower on dps and you like undead then go for it.
---
What other game is he playing?
---
Horde class?
---
How else you gonna get your westfall chicken mate. Spaming /chicken? Lmao
---
It got taken from my drop down menu as well now so I'm out of luck.
---
Playing vanilla wow you get to know her well if you aren't careful.
---
Tauren Druid
---
Again, interesting point.  I'll say I don't believe it.  It seems like a new post-retail meme since the consensus I was aware of previously (and my own experience) contradicts it, but I'm curious to see if it plays out.  It's very possible that I'm wrong.
---
Vanilla tanking and healing are vast improvements to the systems on live...and generally since threat was made irrelevant and mana management stopped being a thing and wa# replaced by spamming every gcd with smart aoe heals. 
---
Class mechanics wise, only dps specs are an improvement over sustained combat rotations from vanilla. 
---
Imo, of course.
---
Can't have enough tanks. Even if there are that many warriors you'll probably still be waiting half an hour to an hour to find that tank for your group.
---
**\[EU - Horde\] Player looking for a cozy home.**Hello there!I suppose a bit of background information regarding who I am will probably be pretty beneficial.
---
I'm a way too old Scandinavian, specifically Swede who's been playing  this game since a month after EU launch. I originally played a warlock  and rogue back in the day and sunk an extraordinary amount of hours into  it. I've done every single raid on heroic/mythic up until Legion and  I've always strived to be the best that I can be at whatever I decided to play, and always put my best foot forwards.
---
I love challenge, I love long and grueling grinds where the more I die,  the more determined I get to down whatever content is giving me a hard  time. Though despite that, I'm very easy going. I rarely get riled up, I'm naturally very calm and logical and I'm always down for a good laugh, some sick bants or other shenanigans.  
---
I've set my sights on playing a **Mage** this time around, to see if the grass really was greener on the other side of the fence but I suppose a discussion can be had about other classes, I am interested in hunters and I have plenty of experience with 'em but Mage is what I desire to play.
---
Bit of a tl;dr of what I can offer the guild:
---
* Driven and determined old man that thrives off of challenge.
---
* I've spent the majority of my online days talking to americans and brits so I'm pretty well-versed with the bants and I'm always up for a laugh.
---
* I have absolutely awful one-liners and dad jokes and I **will** end up laughing at them.
---
* I do a LOT of research regarding my class and the content I need to be doing, as I like to immerse myself fully in what I decided to put my time into.
---
* I'm very laid back and calm as an individual so you won't hear me tilt beyond the sun on a hard boss.
---
What I preferably want from your guild:
---
* Semi-mature preferably
---
* 2 to 3 raids per week sounds like a good medium to aim at.
---
* Driven to clear all content eventually.
---
* Liking and/or loving Bob Ross. I like them happy little trees so it's a big plus.
---
I'm going to be doing as much PvP and PvE as I can possibly fit into a  human solar cycle, if this old man sounds like something you want in your guild or if you want to discuss something regarding my post or  simply get to know me a bit better, feel free drop a comment down below with contact information and/or sketchy links to your guilds, or you can simply PM me. That also works.
---
But seriously fuck new models.
---
I‚Äôm playing warlock because I‚Äôm lazy and casual and still want to be useful in groups as well as have a great solo experience. Some of my favorite memories of vanilla were me chilling on ventrilo with RL friends and solo grinding ogres in tanaris on my (then) alt warlock. There are so many cool class quests too. Love shaman too but not the vanilla version so that‚Äôs out. Warlock is still my main in BfA and I like it still but classic warlock feels like a totally different and fun in a different way class.
---
Mining is absolute shite while leveling it really is. Skinning+lw is a good combo but after a couple of months there's just no real use to your LW unless if you have thorium brotherhood rep.
---
Yeah, my friend got in and said he could even access the Alpha servers. Pretty clearly a system error and I wouldn't hold my breath to get a legit invite out of it.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but that might be the case. However, it seems very easy to abuse as it is now. It would make more sense if your name is unavailable to other players until your character is gone for good, in my opinion.
---
It can proc off the extra attack from SS, just can't proc off a proc of WF
---
Faction
---
1. Combat, yes if you plan to raid you stay combat swords at 60 and only respec when you're going to be pvping for awhile.
---
2. Swords while leveling. Swords at 60 too if you plan to raid.
---
3. Undead are not bad rogues, they are tied with orcs its just preference, if you feel insecure about stopping fears then go undead.  If you're not sure just go with the one you think have better looks, you wont go wrong with either of them.
---
I resubbed in May, made a really awesome 4 tokens that month, but I slimmed down to just 2 this month.  I'm happy with that.  I wanted 10, but I'm so bored of farming.  I didn't even really farm the last couple weeks.  I just reposted hundreds of items and sniped a few things.  There are endless supplies of guides on youtube and r/woweconomy is a great place to get started.  It does keep the game fresh when content gets stale, but I'm too excited for vanilla to really want to farm anymore.  I'd rather take a break before the binge again.
---
Yea but now you can use overpower!
---
"/g gz"
---
DE'ing low lvl items is hardly worth it compared to vendor price. It's not like TBC/wrath etc. where going from 60-70 70-80 questing was worth thousands of gold.
---
Very interesting. It's such a hard decision. Do you think there is a likelihood of struggling to make money with herbalism? It's likely I will be playing evenings 6pm-midnight.
---
What about skinning? Or even blacksmith / mining to make gear for level 40 plus?
---
They spent a ton of time on Deadmines and it became the template for future dungeons in how it tied in with the zone it was in.
---
WC feels like an afterthought. Its huge, but just full of trash pulls.

Introduction:
---
Sorry is a group of close friends and family. We have all experienced Classic WoW, and are excited to have it back. We appreciate a good community, and are looking for players we can get to know and trust. With any MMO we understand max level is just the beginning, but RL is more important to us this time around. With that in mind, we still want to experience ALL aspects from this great game.
---
Goal:
---
Sorry is looking to form a tight group of players before the launch.  We really want to get some fun premade BGs going, but know we will need PvE gear to excel in PvP. Therefore, we expect to run many preraid dungeons to acquire everything we need for raids. We are determined to see all content Classic has to offer - we'll do what it takes!
---
TBD
---
Classes Needed:
---
We are taking anyone interested at this time!

---
druid clawing through...
---
Even the first month and a half of BFA was insanely lucrative.  I spent something like 10 tokens on just blizzard services like transfers and boosts and name changes.  Only a few months later did I realize what a mistake it was.  All the prices plummeted.
---
I was watching MadSeason streaming leveling his warlock, and briefly grouping with a mage aoe grinding gnolls in redridge. The mage cast blizzard and mad followed it with rain of fire on the same group and the fire/ice rain was totally mesmerizing.
---
I mean if you wanna be a miner or herbs I can see that as viable. I personally just wouldn't want it to effect my leveling speed. As my first guy is going to be a mad dash to sixty. Gonna stop and smell the roses on my first alt. My only major thing is I wouldn't go a costly profession before you have a mount.

Uldaman is great if you do all the separate quest chains that lead there. Its pretty dull otherwise.

Ele leveling works fine but not as a hardcaster, you put on shield and dagger and flametongue with fire totem all the way. 1-40 is better as enhancement but not by that much. At 40 you can begin playing more like a ele shaman with doing 3 lightning bolts then auto'ing mobs down.
---
2. How viable is it for raiding? It should be fine in more laid back guilds, those guilds that still clear raids but don't worry about speedruns or anything like that. Just make your intend known from the start and it might even help you get priority on spellpower gear like lokamir (with reduced priority on pure healing items).
---
I‚Äôm doing the same as you right now, playing on a pserver to reacquaint
---
Looks like his weapon is a Rheinmetall 120mm.

Something like this. Depending on how you want to balance PVP/PVE, you might also swap Tidal Focus to Improved Healing Wave, or make other small adjustments.   
---
Lacking the healing threat talent can be troublesome on some naxx trash. Apart from that, this spec means you're only losing mana tide (frequently unnecessary) and 10% healing power. Not a bad trade.
---
Is it fun for you? No? That's really all you have to be concerned about. I mean, you can be concerned about why others find things fun but hey that's your energy to waste.
---
Looks like Final Fantasy 14
---
At first I really liked PoE but then after playing it for a while I realised all you do is find a way to spam 1 damage spell and 1 movement spell and then spend half your time sorting through a fuckload of loot. I still want to like it and play every now and then, especially because I love the skill tree..but I always burn out in similar time to you.
---
Ignore my calls and stay poor. I wrote about TTD at 45
---
It wont be that bad. Ive played plenty of the F R E S H launches where you get like 10k people and never had too many issues
---
Its summer, he has to do something with his free time.
---
So triggered!
---
Charge? its like the best mob claming ability.
---
A very small portion are trust fund babies, their lives prepaid with family wealth. The vast majority who are not so fortunate live with their parents. It becomes (more) problematic when mom and dad get old and eventually die. Then you're left with a fortysomething who has no life skills, no income, and often incapable of communication with the employment world.
---
Trying not to over-generalize, because I don't have any real data, but the neets I've met all tried to apply for disability and were turned down. Issues like social anxiety and depression are not enough of a reason to receive benefits.
---
As an ex smoker, it was the only thing I could think to equate it to. Ha.
---
Really looking forward to wand support! Even if you don't get to it, thanks for your efforts.
---
Grinding beasts from 35-40 would take 20+ hours, but should give a lot of gold. :/
---
Dwarfs have desperate prayer too
---
Looks amazing! üò≤
---
I honestly don't know how bad herbalism will be doing prime time. It's really hard to say.
---
Skinning is decent cash for leveling, but at 60 it doesn't really provide anything other than the ability to farm devilsaurs which requires you to be good pvper with friends. Blacksmithing is not profitable in the slightest, with the exception of you being a guild smither with thorium brotherhood rep and mining is awful to level with no real synergy. The whole idea of going a profession to make gear while leveling is pretty weak, it only really works with leatherworking for agi wearers.
---
I like the concept but if prefer if classic was updated using Blizzard's current art style in retail rather than in Unreal.
---
Thunder fury would like a word with you. I can be full defensive T2 with TF  and mitigate way more damage and my TPS would shit all over you.
---
DW with TF and it gets even uglier.
---
I raided with the best geared feral tank on my server (we gave him a DFT) and he was rarely MT but a solid OT. He could MT just fine but took more damage and did less TPS..
---
Best way to get started - herbalism and mining.  Boring as hell, but steady gold.  Alchemy on popular raid nights can be just as lucrative.  It's a good way to get base capital together, and if you so choose, you can get into a market like flipping BoEs or pets, mounts, anything snipe-able on the AH.
---
I don‚Äôt mind new character models. I really don‚Äôt mind the old ones. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if we get updated world textures. 
---
BUT, if we get updated character models like bfa or just textures on characters and we don‚Äôt get updated textures for at least epic items, it‚Äôll look goofy as shit, imo. 
---
Consider the rerelease of Onyxia in Wrath of the Lich King. The Vis‚ÄôKag and Deathbringer models were both updated. I don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt get the same models with higher res skins that bring out more detail and get rid of that 15 year old texture....fuzziness.
---
i think they are quite similar but with updated textures, more polygons, and slightly more fluid animation.
---
30% but another 10% physical reduction if you have a VW out. Or other bonuses from other pets
---
Sitting in stealth as nelf hunter watching your pet run people down on mounts was fun.
---
God BM hunters are so broken in that bracket.
---
I'll believe it when I see it, Dave!
---
At low levels, it doesn't take much.  Low ranks are inefficient without spell power, and low levels of gear don't have much spell power.  So in the level 10-30 range, it's significantly better to wand (especially if you can get a good wand for the level).
---
At medium levels it can be comparable.
---
After watching  the streamers  I don't think I need to play classic on release I quit before it has even started. ranked up a 2 retail character's in 6 days and just dont even see the point of going back to classic. enjoy.
---
I think perhaps in the long run you are correct. However my experience on private servers has been you can nab quite a bit above vendor value. So long as you do it right. For instance it's almost never worth DE'ing green weapons.
---
i know , once fished with horde player and not a single second i let myself relax thinking he gonna jump me any second.. turned out we fished pracefully and waved goodbye later.. 
---
then when he left i got ganked by high levels.. maybr that pesky horde fisherman called his mate to sic on a low level NE hunter fishing alone
---
You cast Bestial Wrath.
---
Warlock survives just long enough to get dot rotation off.
---
You both lose.
---
Glad you got a laugh out of it 
---
I was laughing as I wrote it lol
---
OP before the first stress test began did you had the 2 PTR accounts issue where one was automatically removed?
---
its ok, most of us aren't
---
Yes it had a cooldown aswell as Warchiefs blessing. It will probably have a cooldown in classic too.
---
But for your last point, a 6 hour timer to 1(2 if horde) worldbuffs does not change worldbuffing, if you are in a guild that worldbuffs, you will still be expected to get the other ones, and most likely you will try form some sort of agreement on your server about onyxia buff times. If anything the 6 hour cooldown just makes worldbuffing more tedious, it doesn't stop it. That's why private servers got rid of timer in the first place and instead disabled world buffs for progression.
---
Honestly you already have heals and tank covered so  just pick whatever you like the most, you guys will breeze through the 5 man content regardless so might aswell enjoy it. But I think mage would be the best out of those 3 cause of sheep and water for everyone. And lastly, portals.
---
It's in beta
---
If any class benefits the most from bag/bank organization, it's probably lock
---
Stoneform is dope. Sadly, the meta has shifted away from wanting tanks who can actually take a beating, to ones who can hold threat off of op dps
---
What raid times do you have in mind, even if just tentative?
---
Before the first stress test began did you by any chance had the 2 PTR accounts issue where one was automatically removed and stress test added it its place?
---
UD is great for pvp.  You get rogue trinket and will of the forsaken.  Combat is best for lvling but assassination is the most fun.  There will be a lot of world pvp going on as you lvl and assassination would be more beneficial for that aspect of the game imo.  Combat will give you best do but assassination is just so much fun
---
Not automatically I had to make a ticket. Then one was changed to WoW 3 and I was able to stress test
---
Leisure is such a hotel word
---
I mean, sure, he‚Äôs, but also contextually, pissed in reference to drunkenedness doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all. 
---
Maybe if it were an undead dwarf with a tankard in his hand...
---
Were you one of the people that before the first stress test began had the 2 PTR accounts issue where one was automatically removed?
---
Fuck
---
SFK, Maurudon, ST are probably my favorites.
---
You got you're computer taken for illegally downloading music? I thought stories of that happening were just a scare tactic.
---
I‚Äôm on your side. I would not mind buffs being correct with CDs. Collecting all of them was tedious, stressful if you died and really made gear feel useless until later raiding (Due to the buffs carrying performance so much). But no, they haven‚Äôt mentioned anything on it. So I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôre keeping the cooldown unless they feel the community wants otherwise? Just a guess
---
Same here.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. You can even tag mobs with a bow/gun if you want.
---
Not sure what game you're playing but that isn't the case at all. it has a massive delay. You need to deal damage to tag it.
---
Putting a DoT on a mob doesn't tag it; only doing the first damage to the mob tags it. The majority of Priests and Warlocks are going to be trying to DoT tag, that cuts out half of your fast tagging group. Then mages have semi-long casts they'll be tagging with. Hunters will be the only "real" competition.
---
&gt; Unless you're in a hardcore guild, 30-0-21 is almost as good as 0-0-51.
---
ALMOST?!? With a 30/0/21 pvp spec you are missing Mana Tide totem that is one of the best talents in the game, 10% healing, 0,5shorter cast time on healing wave, up to 18% less powerful healing wave, 25% less effective mana totems, 25% more expensive totems, 50%-70 more knockback on heal casts, 15% extra heal threat...
---
All that so you can skip 1-2h goldfarming/week...
---
Not really because you need level 10 to learn the weapon skill, and even then they have a huge delay before they fire.
---
What u think about this?  
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/A8P2MwAFM54T1NA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/A8P2MwAFM54T1NA)
---
I'd argue warlocks have it pretty rough. Either cast a shadow bolt, or a 2 second cast time corruption or a 2 second cast time immolate or a CoA that probably takes about 2 seconds to tick. Don't really have a wand during the early levels either.
---
Something something ask for help and group up
---
Interesting - I had the same issue (tho I didnt submit a ticket and got mine automatically removed) and I think thats why ours stress test accounts werent removed
---
(F)ear (O)f (M)issing (O)ut
---
They're doing server 'layering' or whatever, aren't they? There shouldn't be huge #'s of players in zones.
---
Only with pocket healers. BM hunters are where its at if youre queuing solo
---
Yeah but mine didn't get removed until just now.
---
Ah thanks.
---
This happened to me and I had temporary access earlier and now it's gone from my launcher. RIP
---
why not group up then?
---
I had myself targeted.
---
Quest items aren't shared
---
You'll see them in Gurubashi eventually ;)
---
When I played WCII back in the day, it had two ways to play music.  The first was, it had some terrible MIDI sounds it would play.  The second was, it would play off of a CD.  But you could just put in any music CD, and it would play that.  It wouldn't play them in just any order though, it would pick the one that corresponded to what you were doing (by track number).  
---
Anyway, my entire build order ended up being based on what song was playing and where in that song I was, entirely without any conscious interaction.  It became a game clock.
---
So far all of the people Ive asked about this that still had the stress on their accounts were people with the PTR "issue" so I assume thats what kept us having the stress test account until now. I still have the stress test access as of now (tho useless for the time being)
---
There's an addon I used to like that would record the text of any lore books that were read (Librarian maybe?). That would be nice to have again

This is a common pvp spec for ele shamans.

It can work in raids, especially for chain hel spam, but you are sacrificing A LOT just to skip 1-2h goldfarming/week...

Hmmm

---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vol%27jin
---
Prior to this comment I didn't know what everyone was complaining about with streamers.
---
Now I'm woke as fuck.
---
I really hate the new models and I really can't see why people like them. Everything from the models skipping around (human male looks like he needs to take a big dump) to the model textures themselves.
---
Maybe it has to do with the fact that I really disliked WoD, I'm not sure... but I'd MUCH rather have the type of textures showcased here.
---
Depends slightly on the class. Currently playing a pserver with a paladin lvl 19 (not twink) and I was surprised about thr number of abilities at that level. I guess that partly explains why so many are paladin. But tbh, in vanilla I had a lvl 19 rogue semi twink which was fun, but man i had it to join a bg not being twink against 6 or 7 twinks. You feel utterly useless and since there is no timer on WSG you could easily be ganked for 60 minutes if the other team refuses to win.
---
I love Vanilla but I think the game would be exponentially better if it had more content revolving around explicitly shanking boars.
---
Once blizzard get the mechanics of 1.13 down, I‚Äôd actually really like togglable new updated textures.
---
STV - D-Day: June 6, ~~1944~~ 2019
---
My server in vanilla had at least 1 on alliance and 2 on horde, may have been 2 on alliance.
---
Not to defend layering but isn't it put in place for this exact thing?   Warriors have charge and you can shoot with a ranged weapon to pull mobs but grouping up would probably be best. Even though quest items aren't shared exactly it's still a lot faster to kill a few extra guys than try alone and solo everything. 
---
Also a lot of people have jobs and lives, and have to choose a wow class based on amount of time you can dedicate to the game. Warriors are a time commitment even without the situation you're in.
---
This is some of the most pointless misinformation I've seen yet lol
---
Every heard of a party? It lets you play with others and benefit from their tags as well.
---
No offense but sounds like you weren't questing right.
---
Most pserver heroes has leveled tens of characters think that darkshore is OP and westfall is the worst zone. Most people route as human/dwarf/gnome is to finish starting zone, then go loch modan for a bit, then go darkshore, then back to lochmodan at around 16, then decide if they want to go Deadmines and go westfall/redridge, or if they want to speed level and go redridge and back to darkshore and ashenvale.
---
In some cases you are objectively right, in others you are objectively wrong.  Every one of my characters was utterly ruined by that patch.  Yours may have been improved.
---
Doesn't it only have 3 charges or something? Gonna have to spend most of your time farming gnomer if you want to compete in dmg.
---
Yep, it actually happened. Four German policemen knocked on our door and literally went through every drawer in the house, looking for illegally downloaded material (dumb fucks left a cd holder filled with ripped cd's in the living room), and they took our four PC's with them for 9 months, to go through them and file a case against us. We got attacked by a bunch of huge companies so 10k was really not too bad of an outcome considering.
---
Probably Annihilator. It's pretty baller since it should stack with druids faerie fire.
---
Half way to half way to half way
---
... to half way
---
I remember turning the spell effect up with a macro and crashing my game with the flaming meatballs from hell.
---
I'd spam in org "LF1 DPS BWL PST Flowers for invite". Flowers was our priest lead, and he hated everyone. At the time we were one of only a couple guilds that had bwl on farm.
---
Thought I was being to critical when I tried to play WoW for the first time and told my brother nope I can't do it these animations are hot garbage, didn't even feel like WoW when combined with the fact that my "rogue" had his entire tool kit gutted and separated into some weird ass menu that made me choose one or another. I mean lmao can't have gouge and kidney at the same time (idr if this was the case it's just an example) so I just moved along and forgot about WoW.
---
Glad I'm not the only one who hates the animations and models.
---
No changes.
---
Why are you so angry? You know people play games to have fun, if you're so mad maybe you should stick to the sims. 
---
 Also Blizzard said they will be layering for launch so you're fucking stupid.
---
Man I didn't know I wanted this till now
---
I remember back when people had that program to edit their models, being able to change client side models around so they could ride cool mounts or have a cool hunter pet. Or, you know, glitch through the floor into C‚ÄôThuns area without clearing past the first boss.
---
This is the kind of actual game discussion I like to see on here.
---
Hrm, which of these changes?  What should we change?  Should we change that thing?
---
Is this quote supposed to be a Simpleflips reference? He says this ALL the time.
---
I'm coming off a half decade hiatus and was a devote ElvUI user. This is the first I've heard of Schism. Looks minimalistic and lightweight, I can see many enjoying it
---
But 2 people kill mobs more than twice as fast, so xp gains and theoretically item aquisition is increased too. Duo leveling is only slower if one person moves at a slower pace than the other one would if he were solo.
---
That you have to farm 10 of for one raid.
---
Dun Morogh is the best starting zone. Change my mind.
---
Just go as a rogue and let the drops dictate what you spec.  You can farm for a Felstriker + DM dagger preraid and make the switch when you get them.
---
I'd be surprised if it's more than 1
---
You‚Äôre something else my dude. I find it hilarious. You post about having trouble getting girls yet also claim to be a self made millionaire. You know what girls like? Money. So if everything your saying is true, there‚Äôs something fundamentally wrong with you. 
---
My guess it‚Äôs your incel attitude and being an all around prick to people you don‚Äôt even know.
---
Have remember as well, hunters have to buy arrows also, it's something many people are going to be in shock about haha.
---
Charge, rend is the way to go plus you instantly swing after charge. Only hunter and druids have something better. 
---
Priest ..... 1.5 sec cast, Warlock 2 sec cast, Rogue - range weapon. Mage fireblast is 20 yard range, Shaman 20 yard range, paladin 10-15 yard range.
---
Warriors actually have one of the better mob claming abilities.
---
No they're going to change it because Classic is about recreating Private Servers, who cares what it actually was like in vanilla.
---
Dude I'm already having a hard time choosing warrior vs rogue and your not helping just stop! 
---
I was invited to the stress test and it showed up in my client, but today it was removed!  :(
---
That‚Äôs weird, I remember mine doing it all the time
---
I know my server in vanilla had at least 3 guilds complete it, may have been more but I am not sure if more than 1 guild on the other faction completed it.
---
As a mage I've been fire blast tagging with good success
---
Haha no way
---
A lot of people I knew in Vanilla quit because of BC, it killed my guild. :(
---
I'm amazed people still try making these posts.
---
Looking forward to having that little guy running around with me again.
---
same D:
---
Is it even worth it if you get 0 points in other trees? And no death coil, they aren't that strong yet.
---
BFA
---
Example
---
Yeah no
---
1. I'm assuming you're not the only restoration shaman in the raid. That being the case, you don't actually need Healing Way to get the 18% on healing wave. 
---
2. Not sure why you think you'll experience more spell knock-back. Explain?
---
3. In my experience, mana tide isn't useful in most encounters. (Plenty of exceptions exist, however. Especially if you're playing with a sub-optimal raid.)
---
4. The mana totem works out to a difference of about 4 mana per tick. Sounds big when you say '25%'.
---
5. If you think you can farm 100g in an hour, you are likely mistaken.
---
&gt; It should be fine in more laid back guilds, those guilds that still clear raids but don't worry about speedruns or anything like that
---
I see that comment a lot and this guy gives a pretty spot on answer:
---
&gt; it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs.
---
Then join a group with the warlocks or mages? 
---
Pressing ‚Äúinvite to party‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exactly have a high skill cap
---
So? Grouping up and getting some quest items is better then solo getting none. Even if no one wants to group up your still a warrior, slap on a shield and either go tank some dungeons or grind mobs that arent tied to a quest.
---
Do you really think that anyone who is smart is going to be waiting around to complete quests? No they will be doing what nets them the moat exp per hour and if that means finding a corner and sitting on 1-2 mob spawns then thats what they will do
---
(In actuality its getting a 5 man group together for like the first 7 levels then splitting off into groups of 2)
---
Thanks! I'm glad you appreciate it. I too wish there where more actual game discussion and im surprised the beta has not sparked more of it on the subreddit lately.
---
With the braids moving in the air because of the power of the spell üòç
---
Can a hunter have both melee swing timer and auto shot timer ?
---
You mean like the Disney character models they use?
---
And then never again
---
What spells are you guys not binding to have all these free keys sitting around.. I use 1-5, shift 1-5, ctrl 1-5, q, e, r, f, and have a num pad on my mouse for 1 through 0 shift 1 through 0 and ctrl 1 through 0.  I usually end up using all of those binds for something.  I can tell if my character is trying to auto attack or not by having played this game for literally tens of thousands of hours I don't need it on my bars, I don't even need it bound.  Though I do macro it into some abilities where it makes sense.
---
Warchiefs blessing? Horde scum
---
IMHO, not what this sub is for.
---
I thought this was cool too, until my friends on horde gangbanged me 4v1 and camped me for 30 mins. They said I should have chose correctly.
---
Humans looked better before the change. Especially the cutscene fellas.
---
whether you like them or not is opinion but whether they resemble their predecessors in any way shape or form is something true or false, i think, no?
---
There is discussion from the beta, it's just not happening on here because this subreddit is 99% memes.  
---
It's happening in various theorycrafting discords.
---
Access to max level enchants and lvl 29 makes it dogshit IMO,. Not even sure anyone will bother.
---
Mostly every class suffers from this? 
---
Shaman, mages and Druids are the only ones with true instants at low level. (Paladins once they get judgement, but isn5 that limited range?) 
---
Rogues, hunters start with a instant ranged ability, but the projectile has travel time. 
---
Warriors can learn guns/bows too. 
---
Locks and priests don‚Äôt have any instantly applied damage. 
---
Further group up, 2 people kill mobs more than twice as fast as one, that leads to more xp an hour and more mob drops means more quest drops, since you kill more than twice as fast, quest item acquisition is on par if not faster.
---
We're looking at mostly doing Wed-Fri from about 6 PM PST to 11PM PST. But this is a very tentative and subject to change schedule
---
I was agreeing.
---
True, but it has a CD does it not?
---
I hope someone makes a nice list of all the servers the top streamers are on so I can avoid them.
---
I mean plenty of shit doesn‚Äôt need a bind. You don‚Äôt necessarily need any of your ‚Äútrack ___‚Äù abilities hotkeyed. At least I don‚Äôt. But there‚Äôs like 6 rows of 10 you can do. You use 60 keybinds? Lol
---
So that was a lie
---
I don‚Äôt think you need to do that.
---
I mean, my friends should have chosen correctly ;P (I‚Äôll be back in a August to complain about my friends camping me, I‚Äôm sure)
---
the one below is actually the one without green screen though.
---
LITCHERALLY every single mob in the entire GAME oh my goddddd.  
---
Warriors will *literally* have the worst time that even their exploration experience will be stolen by another class.  
---
I *literally* can't imagine playing a warrior in Classic.
---
If someone gets bis items with less than half of other dps classes, yes its disrespecting them.
---
Um no, it‚Äôs about what it was like in vanilla
---
Interesting. How long does that felstriker and DM last you until it most certainly will drop a pair of swords that's significantly better? Like can you raid with into AQ? Lol imma total noon go easy on me
---
Being as at original release the game was less polished than what we will be getting in classic, there were more people, and I managed to not only level as a warrior, but beat 99% of people to max... This post is trash.... Goodbye
---
Firefall was not even a bad game, it was just published poorly.
---
Cheers! Keep hearing about this one might have to give it a go.
---
&gt; I'm just going to wait a few months to even bother playing the game.
---
Ok, see you in phase 2 he he ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
I don't think the actual position of abilities/items on your UI responding to the keybind is that important, once you play around with it a bit you know what keybind what is. The only thing I recommend is having consumables grouped so you have a clear overview of those and when you need to restock.
---
As for keybinds themselves, I very much recommend also using alt and shift+alt(rebinded to caps) for those very niece ability/item/consumes that you don't use often. 
---
And lastly, those keybinds that are important in PVP I would recommend being very easy to press, without having to let your fingers go of WAD or something like that. This way you can move freely in pvp while also using any ability. In raiding or PVE you don't have to move that much and it doesn't really matter if you have to use your WAD fingers to press a key.
---
why would we eat on tables when we have perfectly good bellies!?
---
Yea but I'm just thinking of a named mob for a quest
---
BFA is a terrible game. It's not World of Warcraft in my canon.
---
Im trying to understand if you can read! I have a gf and a big cock im quite content!
---
If you're that concerned with keybinds switch WASD to ESDF. That gives you 20 keys easily within reach, with 3 modifiers that's 80 keybinds...
---
I wasn't before but now I'm actually just really disappointed to not be a part of the beta. I currently have no games that I'm playing &amp; have an abundance of free time. Watching streamers play it is not the same thing.
---
The salt is palpable.
---
Every skill gets a bind.  Bandages, health stones, health potions, anything you might have any need to use as a reaction, open professions, hearth stone, defensive cds, offensive cds, trinket 1, trinket 2, engineering items, consumables like faps, downranked versions of spells, ect..  I just queue up an auto attack by right clicking, no need to take up space!
---
You know how when you learn about history you learn how in the 1700s and 1800s european armies would just line up and volley musket shots at each other across an empty field, and you always think, HOW did they think that would be the most effective means of engaging in warfare?
---
After viewing this screenshot, I understand
---
Pandaren aren't an allied race so no it's only 8 but yes they are both horde and alliance
---
If you plan to respec while leveling, you start with the good tier 1 talents, and once you have enough levels, you swap to combat.  Daggers have faster speeds and therefore worse instant attacks- which rogue, alone among classes, partially inverts by having a few really good attacks that can ONLY be done with daggers.  The issue is, every one of these attacks is positional.  You can still get efficient attacks if you trade time and combo points and energy for the various stuns and gouges, but your best return is going to be hammering things with the highest dps non-dagger weapon as combat.  If you get a *really good* dagger, then just use that, of course.  Try to stay on top of weapon upgrades, generic advice that is more true for rogues than most.  
---
Swords, fists, and maces are all very similar, having comparable weapon speeds.  The only meaningful differences occur deep in the combat tree, when swords can pick up an ability that resets the swing timer on the mainhand weapon, maces can proc a stun on an alien DR, and fists can crit more often.  If you truly have unlimited access to weapons, maces will probably help you a bit more whilst leveling solo, but all are totally fine to level with.  
---
Undead has no pve racial but is very strong in pvp.  Orc is good in both.  Neither is any manner of bad choice, unless you definitely for sure want a pve racial (in which case, troll &gt; orc, assuming you are a filthy hordie).
---
Same here, might've been everyone with only access to the stress test?
---
I saw a blue post about that. They said some people in stress test were thinking they were in the beta because of it being on the launcher so they removed it from launcher for those on the stress test list. It'll reappear when the next stress happens.
---
I had a rat parry my auto attack on a level 3 rogue....
---
I was so impressed I let the bastard live after that.
---
I agree but in my case I really needed to make this set up so I could have the 3x4 grids to correspond to my grid of side buttons on the mouse.
---
I had a similar experience in vanilla.  I had a blast. But leveled a quicker.  I made many good friends.
---
All I see now is how people want to get to 60 the fastest.  I dont think it will be as fun. Plus I dont have the time to do that stuff anymore.
---
You want Gnomish Engineering. Then take mining, or alchemy or something for the CDs and buy stone/ore from the AH.
---
I've been leveling alts in retail, does not scratch the itch........ 
---
I need Beta so badly!!!!
---
They are not though? A cording to wow census there are more 120 dwarves than many other races. They are not the most popular but they are not the least.
---
This is so wholesomme. Unless he dieded
---
Low quality bait
---
...wtf
---
Tend to agree. except I have not played the game for 14 years to I have decided to upgrade 2 characters based on classic and I will be done with it within 30 days on retail. and as protest I will not play classic and I will go back to popping heads with skill instead of button bashing.
---
I think you may need to put 
---
/script 
---
at the very top
---
locks and priests do have curses and SWP but yes to everything else
---
Not sure about the plans for classic but in retail, there is a naga addon that sets up action bars in that same 3x4 grid
---
Hello, my girlfriend and I are looking for friends and a casual-hardcore (casual commitmentwise, hardcore mentality) Alliance guild on a PvP server. I will play a prot warrior, however I will respec as needed for PvP or DPS. She will be playing a holy priest. Weprobably promise at least 25 hours a week after reaching 60 (more before). I preferably want a guild that's looking to start on a high population server with streamers and other hardcore players in the community. I plan to start streaming on Twitch.
---
Why do you want us?
---
She's an MMO junky and I'm a former level 60 Horde priest with the following experience:
---
* I played classic WoW from closed beta through Naxxramas, and I was the priest class officer for my guild.
---
* My guild (Requiem, Zuluhed US) was consistently the #2 guild on the server, and the top Horde guild on our server. We obtained several server first raid kills including C'thun and multiple in Naxx.
---
* I helped multiple guild members and friends obtain High Warlord in 2005/2006.
---
* The girlfriend didn't play WoW, however she is an experienced healer in Final Fantasy XIV. I am currently teaching her how to play priest on a private server.
---
* We're both willing to put in extra work. We won't shy away from helping with administrative duties in the guild. Farming mats, helping out with the guild discord/website/bank/gear alts.
---
Thanks, and I look forward to many hours of adventures!
---
Yea 30-40 gold for 2-3 hours was solid earnings in vanilla.  Dps classes have a pretty easy time grinding efficient mobs for gold.  
---
Fury has a pretty easy time if you focus on weaker mobs (50-55) because you basically crit them 50% of the time which means they die fast and you have full rage. 
---
Rogues can farm higher level mobs, but kill a bit slower due to setup times.
---
Either one is good for grinding mobs for gold.
---
I believe it is a nickname for Robert Baratheon from Game of Thrones who unfortunately met his demise when taking on a large wild boar after too much delicious strawberry wine.
---
Mods, can we do something about these whiney troll shitposts?
---
I keybind everything you just listed. I literally said I don‚Äôt bind the track certain enemies thing. You can‚Äôt queue up an auto shot by right clicking... again. You use 60 binds? You‚Äôre just trying to humble brag but are missing the point that I know you don‚Äôt use 60 binds. There are 100% a few open spots avail.
---
You don't think the 3D modelling in BFA is superior to the 3D modelling (or lack of) in Vanilla / Classic?
---
Just because the expansion wasn't great, doesn't mean the modelling wasn't more advanced.
---
There are some people that believe everything you said, and think that makes our choices more meaningful, not less.
---
Also if your playing at launch rhen everyone is leveling and the people who spent 18 hours a day to get ahead of the pack, there first priority isnt going to turn around and gank people its going to be getting gold and pre raid BIS
---
I like seeing this data in anticipation for the third final big poll on this subreddit.  Going to be a big use for me in determining my final allegiances.
---
Try making what posts? I'm just asking the communities opinion on changes to me implemented in the future. I would assume not everyone wants to be playing a game that looks like a potato 10 years from now.
---
Great, thanks.
---
thats pretty good lol
---
Where is this 1% hit ignored coming from?
---
If you think you'll mostly PvP, go Undead. Mostly PvE: Orc.
---
That's what I'm asking. I want to know what people would change, if anything.
---
I personally think the armour being completely flat on character models could be updated and reworked with better textures / modelling. Same designs tho.
---
Good job guys, bump and petition to get WatchYourSixx a beta key! He is the hero we need.
---
Thanks! Are you happy with the QoL changes that are being put into Classic so far?
---
I have a disability that's kept me from being able to do much, but yes I do worry about how I will ever survive, I can't stay with my parents forever. I keep looking for some kind of work from home but it's hard :(
---
No, like the new improved models they use that are more detailed and stylised than the old models that they built on the original modified Warcraft 3 engine
---
You're right I do put auto shot on T when I play a hunter now that I think about it, though.  I have 54 binds that I use routinely.  I have extra skills that I don't want to fat finger on another bar too.  I typically play warlock in vanilla.. there's a lot of spells.  Sure they don't all need a keybind but clicking a spell is annoying.  And I guess I have my wand bound there too, lol.

Shadow Oil scales at 56% (80% + low level penalty) and gets the increased damage from ISB without consuming charges, on the classic beta right now :) We never expected enchants or gear procs to scale and haven't been banking on that.

AB is the reason I was honor capped when I hit level cap for the first time.
---
CUDA  Waifu build.
---
I like the Panda one, because at the end of it you find out you've been on a big turtle the whole time.
---
i'd be okay with 24% of the leveling playerbase being warriors, finding a tank for a leveling instance will be easy.
---
Wintergrasp is absolutely phenomenal. 15 years later, still my favourite.
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Long Answer: Highly likely. I haven't tested it because I don't have beta access but all of the settings allow for it.
---
Wow and here I was thinking this issue would be ignored. Good on the Classic team! Continuing to exceed our expectations
---
Really glad they're reducing talent respec costs.  This has been a fairly large problem for anyone I've watched who wants to test them.
---
If you level faster than the rest of them, then you can run around and gank your friends. But like, just your friends because doing it to others is assholeish. But to friends it‚Äôs funny af.
---
I would love some advice on a rogue, holy shit 6-12 can't be nearly impossible to solo more then 1 enemy at a time.
---
Even if I get crafty with gouge bandaging. 
---
I actually prefer daggers since it allows me to control the fight with gouge and wait for energy to tick back. If I just go toe to toe with them it's 50/50 if they are 2 levels above me, a missed gouge could mean my death.
---
20% of any group composition is warriors, it's not very oversaturated indeed
---
When I mained a lock. I had two such bags in the bank. They would be filled at random and simply swapped in come raid time. Normally I would refill after raid then abandon them in the bank again. When soloing it's normally easier just to use the normal large bags.
---
Oh that's the "I pulled two mobs and didn't have a potion ready as a warrior" screen! Saw her a lot
---
Pssst!  They don‚Äôt want you to know how much time you‚Äôre spending!
---
pro tip: if you add a ' it becomes 2 words. Easy way to think of it &lt;3
---
You‚Äôd replace both in MC theoretically with Perdition‚Äôs Blade + Corehound Tooth in MC in theory. Assuming you get them to drop and actually get to loot them when they do.
---
If you have bad taste or "Anything not Vanilla sucks" syndrome, then sure.
---
Oh so a tiered release. Makes sense.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
Lol at everyone saying they aren't excited anymore because they've watched streamers do most of the content already. 
---
First off, you don't have to watch. I know it's hard not too but it is an options. 
---
Second, I would assume most of those who are saying that aren't in the beta and that's why they're saying that. Sure as shit you'd be on that grind and have a different opinion if you were playing
---
Not in germany it's not, they go ham on you..
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. I‚Äôm an 04 and I‚Äôm not in lol.
---
We are 3 weeks into a 14/15 week beta and have had a. Ton of things either confirmed or reported. There's still a ton of time for them to fix things.
---
But this doesn‚Äôt happen in the US does it? (Legit question)
---
  Also, did you have a vpn? A proxy? Or were you just downloading without the precautions?
---
So are edge Masters not worth it for humans?
---
well you should have lol
---
Gonna be honest , if you intend to play during release week then mining and herbalism is going to be rough to level.
---
You can just not watch
---
Comes from other games where you're on public servers to play matchmaking, but there are also private servers where friends and groups can play alone.
---
Tetris fail with the middle block of raid frames. Shame.
---
I think there will be too many warriors that just want to DPS. In theory they are the best DPS in the game, but you can't have 10 warriors in every raid since gearing them all up will take forever.
---
Thanks Harold!
---
I‚Äôd love it but my potato of a laptop couldn‚Äôt run it if it were remastered like that. I already have to run it on the lowest settings lol
---
16, 25, and 40 year olds get some liberty in picking an age group.
---
You sound like a buttersoft individual
---
This, I like this. I‚Äôve always wanted an option to give the orcs more than 2 polygons for a face
---
.....what? Wtf are you talking about, the animations for casting is the same as they were back in the day for the most part excluding the new animations they gave for lava burst and paladin heals
---
I don't understand why ppl recommend alchemy for raiders, yet engineering for hardcore raiders. I mean... Why not just recommend engineering for everybody? Does it require more time/effort to lvl or something?
---
I didn't pass anything as fact. This is all my opinion from anecdotal evidence gathered over the years. I'm sorry fangirl hurt your feelings. I am a fangirl of wow, that's why Im here in the first place... Like I said I've played for years.
---
I didn't call out downvoters, a guy claimed my post was satirical, mocking it entirely instead of explaining why he though my **opinions** we're wrong. Same with the first guy just posting a meme instead of stating his side. Then we have the last guy using the old "umadbro" instead of, again, stating his own opinion. The only people who actually care about votes are the ones just meming instead of putting out their own thoughts and opinions.
---
Woo Ping
---
changes
---
I got goosebumbs and its weird almost, its a simply, yet touching put together thing. That I, or anyone, get even slightly emotional at this is so interesting, but yet I do.. 
---
the feels man
---
warriors that don't want to tank deserve to never get a group, they should reroll
---
I agree with what you‚Äôre saying and I plan to main a priest, but I am doubting the average player will enjoy leveling a priest that has to wand mobs to death until at least level 40, or drink after every pull. Also, Private servers have more hardcore players than classic will. Let‚Äôs see.
---
Tbh, classic could use both this and the in game calendar, it should‚Äôve been in since launch instead of being added only in wrath
---
You can definitely sinister strike and Hemo with daggers.
---
This reminds me alot of front stabbing on pservers. It's just not possible on beta I heard.
---
I will do the same, although I doubt I will level mining until after hitting 60.
---
It scares me that no one will answer this. It's a shame because I was really excited  and was the driving force behind trying to get my friends to play.
---
Nobody forces you to rush to 60, there will be plenty of people and guilds playing slowly. You'll have plenty of people to play with and begin gearing once you reach 60.
---
GO! RUN BACK TO IRONFORGE! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE!
---
Was alliance in vanilla but had to switch to horde starting TBC, always been horde up until BFA but come classic we are going back to the roots.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!!! You horde pvpers better watch out
---
I‚Äôve never been this excited for a game before in my life. I am thinking about it almost every day and am looking up videos and info online all the time. I feel like I will burnout before classic is released.
---
Oh god this is just gettinf better and better
---
A lot of games have clocks. Only WoW needs a calendar so the players know what day of the week it is.
---
I really like how it isn't overly sexualized and you totally don't have the exact same gear in your bags that everyone else did. THE FEELS!!!
---
Better not cry
---
If you really want to you could wait for mages to get high enough level and see if you can get a portal.
---
See that dead guy? Yeah that's me... I bet you are wondering how i got to this point...
---
*80's sut com music*
---
Yes it's the exact same as having +4% hit from gear.
---
Dude imagine being an alliance rogue against orc. There isn't even a cd to play around that one.
---
You know I almost kinda missed corpse running. 
---
It's like a little break that let's you really think about what you just fucked up. 
---
Vs just flying there in 30s or less.
---
Yeah the horde is pretty awesome
---
YAAAAAAAAA
---
More people make it easier but it yields less loot per person and you cannot complete quests (cept UBRS)
---
Yup. Worried about a 20 min run? No worries, just don't play the game for 3 weeks.
---
It's still showing on mine as well
---
Dodge, Parry, Block
---
Is engineering really that OP?
---
Oh, I wasn't doing that! I will give this a try, thank you.
---
(Also this is on RetroWoW client, so not the Beta client.)
---
Now hopefully they will leave the respec coat that low forever into launch :)
---
My older brother won‚Äôt play because he ‚Äúbeat it‚Äù (he was on KT in naxx when it was still vanilla, not sure of the patch/date) but my younger brother is in. So, I‚Äôm going to see if I can convince my older brother to play if we multibox him to level him up, because that‚Äôs the part he hates the most.
---
This gave me flashbacks to Silkroad Online, but still seems like a lowball for Chakji kills.
---
The community was the coolest part of the game. I remember in Vanilla I pugged everything for the first line while. I was doing undead Strat runs over and over again trying to get my pants when I met a warrior called Superstylin who was decked in t2 and t3. He joined one of my groups to help his bro do the times run. I healed as a Pally and we crushed it. Added each other to BTag after and every so often I would message him what he was up to and if he wanted to come do X with my bro and I as we pugged so much. Dude would come on occasion and was always so chill.
---
Towards the end of Vanilla he asked me if I wanted to come run some BGs with his guildies and I said sure. They were all decked out in T3 at this point and they absolutely obliterated every BG while I healed. They liked my healing and use of Paladun utility so some added me to BTag. Later in BC they invited me to their guild and that was my first hardcore raiding experience in a top US 50 guild. 
---
It all started with a simple pug and a cool dude. That just doesn't happen anymore really. Every guild or run I have applied to now just checks my logs and sees my parses and gives me a trail just based upon that.
---
I want to play but at the same time I don't want to invest days into a character that's going to be deleted in August just so I can turn around and level it up again.
---
I agree.
---
This will be a little ramshackle but but my keybinds are
---
1Q2E3456frt9z  and then just add a row for shift ctrl and alt
---
Years ago I had literally hundreds of illegally downloaded music. My wife did it too back in the day. So did everyone else I know. Nobody as ever arrested or prosecuted or anything. Yes in the US
---
I'm a minimalist, I either design my own minimal UI with things like bartender, or I use the base UI with minimal addons like moveanything. Just simple things that give me basic customisation. Moveanything is always a must for me, as there are some things that just can't be moved otherwise which can be a pain when old UI and modern monitors clash. I also want some kind of addon to show me the start locations of quests on the map, only the start location though. I don't want a questhelper, I like reading directions in quest text and feeling like I'm having an adventure, I just want to be shown where available quests are so I don't miss out or forget ones I want to do.
---
What about wep debuffs like annihilators?
---
i'm too drunk to respond to your comment in a reasonable manner but holy shit you are the exact type of person who should stay the fuck away from classic lmao
---
I'm not worried. I'm just curious about if the info I have is correct and the best  way to go about it.
---
I was wondering the same thing.. I really hope not.
---
I don't know how it is in the US. Yes it was without precautions, like we were used to from living in the Netherlands.
---
The basement dwellers crying streamer priveledge are the only fun these threads offer.
---
Kids are so salty and it's hillarious to watch em break down.
---
Play what ever you want that you think you'll like. I watched Kevin Jordan's (vanilla wow lead designer) stream not long ago and he wished that people would explore and those who know most things will let new players to explore and fall in love with the game. He made a comparison that a child is amazed and loves to find out new things on their own even if the parents already knew the answer. The moment of finding something new is genuinely so overwhelmingly enjoyable feeling that the parents will love watching it as it reminds them about the time they found out the same thing.
---
The older folk who have experienced all this already could actually enjoy those moments in classic as well where someone else new finds something on their own and is amazed. Classic has lots to offer for both old and new if they just let the game do its trick and people don't spoil everything and expect everyone to understand everything before they even step in hand.
---
So let me say this again. Play whatever you feel like playing. There are no bad classes in classic. Each one has amazing class fantasy and they are enjoyable to play. Just pick what feels like the best for you or what speaks to you!
---
Dw fury warrior dps with windfury totem can be godly.
---
Except in the case that off spec or side grade gear gets sharded instead of handed out. Now instead of a guy who can maybe help in another role because he picked up offspec gear along the way you have a little gold for the guild and a bunch of guys pissed off they can't build their second set because of how much it would hurt them to spend those points.
---
Mage for both :D
---
You sound like a mentally soft individual
---
its okay 99% of the player base isnt also
---
For sure. 8 of any particular spec is on the higher end. I'm just saying, one of the benefits of playing, for example, a prot warrior is that you gear up pretty quickly. And one of the downsides of playing something like mage is that you're competing with more people for gear.
---
Pally buffs make alliance lock way better in a raid scenario imo. Ppl cry bout wotf but like others have said , you don't have to deal with unkillable paladin's soooo lol I'm rolling alliance lock for sure
---
Life Pro Tip: farm and sell Savory Deviate Delights. It's how I paid for my first mount. I was also an Alliance on a PvP server which I'm sure helped to drive the price up because it's farmed in Horde territory.
---
gotta say seeing this reminds me that (if they do decide to go this route) there is a lot of room for horizontal expansions, big unexplored regions like hyjal and tons of just unused mountains or just pop an island here or there. un-contacted tribes, ancient ruins, lost expeditions, I think if its something the community and creators would want there's space in the actual continent as well as the mythos itself
---
I had make most of my abilities into macros to cancel form first, quicker and smoother than cancelling form yourself and casting a spell. Here's what most of my ability macros look like:
---
#showtooltip
---
/cancelaura Travel Form
---
/cancelaura Bear Form
---
/cancelaura Dire Bear Form
---
/cancelaura Aquatic Form
---
/cancelaura Cat Form
---
/cast Regrowth
---
It works great. For forms, I use this macro. it will cancel and shift back in with one click.
---
/cast Cat Form
---
Another one I made last night casts seal if I'm in water, and travel otherwise if possible.
---
/cast [swimming] Aquatic Form; Travel Form
---
I guess the only one I use a lot is the quick NS+HT macro which I spam when trying to panic heal someone.
---
/castsequence Nature's Swiftness, Healing Touch
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
One more follow up question if you wouldn't mind. I've read that you need 4% hit to be hit capped in pvp, so I can go 2/5 Shadow Focus and I'll be good?
---
Death coil
---
Right right. And when is then the next theoretical change? I'm not familiar at all with what raids "come after" what. Only thing I know is naxx is "last" and AQ is "before naxx". Like how many times do you theoretically change daggers throughout raiding if all of them drops?
---
I get that. This post is just to allow warlock mains to speak on why they love the class over others.
---
0.2 seconds of contact with WF totem and sword specc is all you need
---
EQ was shit.
---
You should fill the app out and we can talk for sure. I hit my minimum but we stay frosty
---
You can actually, vanilla raids aren't hard
---
Gonna have to hoof it through the barrens over to .org and take the zepp. You should be okay for most of the journey, just stick to the roads and watch out for any wandering &gt;asshole&lt; raptors &amp; lions that want to turn you into lunch. 
---
Takes about 22 minutes give or take a few deaths. Good luck! It‚Äôs totally worth it (might be annoying to find trainers for Druid, Shaman, Hunter, etc... since undead can‚Äôt be those classes)
---
This is awesome. I feel like the  I c I -&gt; l o l  one is a bit redundant seeing how everyone knows what kek means.
---
Hi,
---
LF (semi) hc raiding (and pvp) guild.
---
Druid prefered, but may consider warlock, priest, shaman (in that order)
---
PvP server
---
Herbalism/Alchemy if rolling druid/healer
---
Play time: monday, thuesday and thursday available from 18:00; wednesday and sunday available from 20:00; friday from 13:00; saturday whole day available. Friday and saturday I can make it very late, all other days till 01:00 max unless rly pushing for progress.
---
No experience with Vanilla raid content, but I did read and watched an awfull lot of guides/tactics. Started playing late Vanilla as a paladin, this through TBC and WoTLK as a holy paladin where I did most raid content, so raid mechanics will not be a problem at all.
---
This is amazing, big props to the people involved to make this. Thank you so much guys
---
fuck it, i can‚Äôt stand this sub anymore. You don‚Äôt have to know that the sun/moon icon at the top right of your minimap tells you the time when you hover over it, thats fine. But if you start complaining that this clock should be in the game because otherwise you have no in-game way of telling time, you should have your rights to post here removed! It‚Äôs not about this fucking clock, idgaf if they put it in or not, it‚Äôs the fact that you are creating a problem that does not exist, because you didn‚Äôt spend two minutes on Bing, and then want changes to be made to the original game, based on your ignorance, to these non-problems... Sorry, i had to get this out
---
There are upgrades for all weapon types on each tier of raiding Blackwing Lair would be the tier of raiding between MC/Onyxia and AQ.
---
I guess you may be right. Some people like to eat shit too, doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable just because I think shit tastes bad
---
Some do, others absolutely don't when compared to their Vanilla/Classic counterpart. 
---
Bolvar's/VanCleef's haircut for example is off way worse.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Pugging the first gimme mythic boss is not that uncommon.
---
I think a druid would be cool from a thematic standpoint
---
This isn't a speed run type of game, also yes speed runners are stupid
---
